1
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:34,070
Drink up, me hearties,
yo ho

2
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:38,744
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot

3
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:42,687
Drink up, me hearties,
yo ho

4
00:00:42,756 --> 00:00:46,192
Yo ho, yo ho

5
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,696
A pirate's life for me

6
00:00:49,763 --> 00:00:54,097
We extort, we pilfer,
we filch and sack

7
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:55,260
Drink up

8
00:00:55,336 --> 00:00:56,598
Quiet, missy.

9
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,264
Cursed pirates sail
these waters.

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,035
You don't want to bring them.

11
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:03,736
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.

12
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,041
She was singing about pirates.

13
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:07,842
It's bad luck to be singing
about pirates

14
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:09,974
with us mired
in this unnatural fog.

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,210
Mark my words.

16
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:13,219
Consider them marked.

17
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,583
On your way.

18
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:16,748
Aye, Lieutenant.

19
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:19,418
It's bad luck to have
a woman on board, too.

20
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:22,223
Even a miniature one.

21
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:25,527
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

22
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,624
Think again, Miss Swann.

23
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:31,432
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

24
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:34,565
I intend that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

25
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:38,509
or wears a pirate brand gets
what he deserves.

26
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,514
A short drop and a sudden stop.

27
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:46,877
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor,

28
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:49,650
but I'm concerned
about the effect

29
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:52,089
this subject will have
upon my daughter.

30
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,024
My apologies, Governor Swann.

31
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:56,119
Actually,
I find it all fascinating.

32
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:58,824
Yes.
That's what concerns me.

33
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,759
Look! A boy!
There's a boy in the water!

34
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:33,198
Man overboard!

35
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,733
Man the ropes.
Fetch a hook.

36
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:38,635
Haul him aboard.

37
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,876
He's still breathing.

38
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:51,577
Mary, Mother of God.

39
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:00,454
What happened here?

40
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:01,926
It's the powder magazine.

41
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:04,395
Merchant vessels run
heavily armed.

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,734
A lot of good it did them.

43
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,464
Everyone's thinking it.
I'm just saying it.

44
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:14,132
Pirates.

45
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:17,666
There's no proof of that.
It's probably an accident.

46
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,642
Rouse the captain immediately.

47
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:23,774
Heave to and take in sail.
Launch the boats.

48
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:29,881
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

49
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:32,016
He'll be in your charge.

50
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,719
Take care of him.

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,105
It's okay.

52
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:57,946
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

53
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:00,543
Will Turner.

54
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:02,555
I'm watching over you, Will.

55
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:17,363
You're a pirate.

56
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,337
Has he said anything?

57
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:23,570
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

58
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,771
Take him below.

59
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,978
Elizabeth?

60
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:41,446
Are you all right?

61
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:43,284
Are you decent?

62
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:44,654
Yes.

63
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:46,522
Yes.

64
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,653
Still abed at this hour?

65
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,198
Oh, it's a beautiful day.

66
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,128
I have a gift for you.

67
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,637
Oh, it's beautiful.

68
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,038
Isn't it?

69
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:05,536
May I inquire
as to the occasion?

70
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:08,979
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

71
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,376
Go on.

72
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:16,249
Actually, I...

73
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:20,352
I hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

74
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:21,758
The ceremony?

75
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,626
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

76
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:25,528
I knew it.

77
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,898
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

78
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:31,699
A fine gentleman,
don't you think?

79
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:34,036
He fancies you, you know.

80
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:37,076
Elizabeth?
How's it coming?

81
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:39,578
It's difficult to say.

82
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,046
I'm told it's the latest fashion
in London.

83
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:46,017
Well, women in London
must've learnt not to breathe.

84
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,222
Milord, you have a visitor.

85
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:08,602
Mr. Turner.

86
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:10,267
Good to see you again.

87
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:11,935
Good day, sir.

88
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:14,811
I have your order.

89
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:20,744
Well.

90
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,085
The blade is folded steel.

91
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:26,353
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

92
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,155
If I may.

93
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:31,431
Perfectly balanced.

94
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:35,195
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

95
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:39,737
Impressive.
Very impressive.

96
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,398
Now, now.

97
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:45,571
Commodore Norrington is going
to be very pleased with this.

98
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:48,842
Do pass my compliments on
to your master.

99
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,443
I shall.

100
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,319
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

101
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:01,425
Elizabeth,
you look absolutely stunning.

102
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:03,122
Will.

103
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:05,721
It's so good to see you.

104
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,097
I had a dream about you
last night.

105
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:08,964
About me?

106
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:11,196
Yes, is that entirely proper
for you --

107
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,398
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

108
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,464
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

109
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,568
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

110
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:22,308
At least once more,
Miss Swann, as always.

111
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,508
There. See?

112
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,949
At least the boy has a sense
of propriety.

113
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,614
We really must be going.
There you are.

114
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:31,680
Good day, Mr. Turner.

115
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,026
Come along.

116
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,422
Good day.

117
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:42,492
Elizabeth.

118
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,348
What -- hey.

119
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:16,293
Hold up, there, you.

120
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:20,424
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat at the dock.

121
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:24,295
And I shall need to know
your name.

122
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:28,572
What do you say
to three shillings,

123
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:30,576
and we forget the name?

124
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:36,477
Welcome to Port Royal,
Mr. Smith.

125
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:14,577
Two paces march!

126
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,085
Right about-face!

127
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:24,329
Present arms!

128
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:50,516
This dock is off limits
to civilians.

129
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,387
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't know.

130
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,362
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

131
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:02,393
There's some sort of high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort.

132
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:05,734
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen such as yourselves

133
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,569
did not merit an invitation?

134
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:11,633
Someone has to make sure
this dock stays off limits.

135
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,508
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

136
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,744
But it seems to me
that a ship like that

137
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:21,150
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

138
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,088
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true.

139
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:27,524
But there's no ship as can match
the Interceptor for speed.

140
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:28,686
I've heard of one.

141
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:32,027
It's supposed to be very fast.
Nigh uncatchable.

142
00:12:32,098 --> 00:12:33,861
The Black Pearl,

143
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:40,633
Well, there's no real ship
as can match the Interceptor,

144
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:42,675
Black Pearl is a real ship.

145
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:44,539
No.
No, it's not.

146
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:46,306
Yes, it is.
I've seen it.

147
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,812
You've seen it?

148
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:48,745
Yes.

149
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:50,783
You haven't seen it.

150
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,044
Yes, I have.

151
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:55,349
You've seen a ship
with black sails

152
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:59,825
that's crewed by the damned
and captained by a man so evil

153
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:03,226
that Hell itself
spat him back out?

154
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:04,490
No.

155
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:06,031
No.

156
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,431
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

157
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,399
Oh.

158
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:11,630
No ship that's not crewed
by the damned

159
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:14,571
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell spat him out

160
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:17,701
could possibly have black sails,
therefore couldn't be

161
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:19,074
any other ship
than the Black Pearl,

162
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:21,909
Is that what you're saying?

163
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:23,107
No.

164
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:26,050
Like I said,
there's no real ship

165
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,610
as can match the Interceptor,

166
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,184
Hey!

167
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,657
You!

168
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:35,853
Get away from there!

169
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:38,295
You don't have permission
to be there.

170
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:40,628
I'm sorry.
It's such a pretty boat.

171
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,792
Ship.

172
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:42,857
What's your name?

173
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:45,496
Smith.
Or Smithy, if you like.

174
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:48,939
What's your purpose
in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?

175
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:50,134
Yeah.
And no lies.

176
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,611
Well, then, I confess.

177
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,705
It is my intention to
commandeer one of these ships,

178
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:57,682
pick up a crew in Tortuga,
raid, pillage, plunder,

179
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,513
and otherwise pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

180
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,886
-I said no lies.
-I think he's telling the truth.

181
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:07,620
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

182
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:12,097
Unless you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

183
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:24,205
May I have a moment?

184
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,778
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

185
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:42,725
I apologize if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

186
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:47,756
This promotion throws
into sharp relief

187
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:51,565
that which I have not yet
achieved.

188
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:55,774
A marriage to a fine woman.

189
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:59,770
You have become
a fine woman, Elizabeth.

190
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,780
I can't breathe.

191
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:05,750
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

192
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,851
And then they made me
their chief.

193
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:13,953
Elizabeth?

194
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:16,961
Elizabeth!

195
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,964
My God.

196
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:19,760
The rocks!

197
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:22,357
Sir, it's a miracle
she missed them.

198
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,371
-Will you be saving her?
-I can't swim.

199
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,272
Pride of the King's Navy,
you are.

200
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:33,244
Do not lose these.

201
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:49,452
What was that?

202
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:24,521
Make way!

203
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:32,899
I got her!

204
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,130
She's not breathing!

205
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,766
Move!

206
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:44,782
I never would've thought
of that.

207
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:47,217
Clearly you've never been
to Singapore.

208
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,916
Where did you get that?

209
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,822
On your feet.

210
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,227
Elizabeth!

211
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:03,524
Are you all right?

212
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:04,968
Yes, I'm fine.

213
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:10,371
Shoot him.

214
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:11,375
-Father.
-What?

215
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:14,936
Commodore, do you really
intend to kill my rescuer?

216
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,953
I believe thanks are in order.

217
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:32,191
Had a brush with the East india
Trading Company, did we, pirate?

218
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,698
Hang him.

219
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:38,965
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

220
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:40,164
Well, well.

221
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,639
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

222
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,610
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

223
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,613
Well, I don't see
your ship, Captain.

224
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:51,047
I'm in the market, as it were.

225
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:53,017
He said he'd come
to commandeer one.

226
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:56,715
Told you he was telling
the truth. These are his, sir.

227
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:02,555
No additional shot nor powder.

228
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,955
A compass
that doesn't point North.

229
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,537
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

230
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:20,310
You are without doubt the worst
pirate I've ever heard of.

231
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,473
But you have heard of me.

232
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:27,219
Commodore,
I really must protest.

233
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:28,913
Carefully, Lieutenant.

234
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,252
Pirate or not,
this man saved my life.

235
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:34,825
One good deed is not enough
to redeem a man

236
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,124
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

237
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:39,599
Indeed.

238
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,964
Finally.

239
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,491
No.

240
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:43,535
No! Don't shoot!

241
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:45,594
I knew you'd warm up to me.

242
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,969
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

243
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,473
And my hat.

244
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,741
Commodore.

245
00:18:54,313 --> 00:18:57,476
-it is Elizabeth, isn't it?
-It's Miss Swann.

246
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,780
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

247
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:02,650
Come, come, dear.
We don't have all day.

248
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:06,384
Now if you'll be very kind.

249
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,869
Easy on the goods, darling.

250
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:27,010
You're despicable.

251
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,104
Sticks and stones, love.

252
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:32,777
I saved your life.
You save mine. We're square.

253
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:36,344
Gentlemen, milady,
you will always remember this

254
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:41,485
as the day that you almost
caught Captain Jack Sparrow.

255
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:00,045
Whoa!

256
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,841
Now will you shoot him?

257
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:04,041
Open fire!

258
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:06,210
Hey!

259
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,750
On his heels!

260
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,141
Take cover, man!

261
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:34,805
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

262
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:37,441
I would hate for him to miss it.

263
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,387
Search upstairs!

264
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:45,287
Look lively, men!

265
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,289
Whoa!

266
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:20,113
Right where I left you.

267
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:29,183
Not where I left you.

268
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:40,735
You're the one they're hunting.

269
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,809
The pirate.

270
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:46,868
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

271
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:50,712
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

272
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,547
It would be a shame to
put a mark on your record.

273
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,484
So if you'll excuse me.

274
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:01,557
Do you think this wise, boy?

275
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:04,755
Crossing blades with a pirate?

276
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,094
You threatened Miss Swann.

277
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:12,098
Only a little.

278
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,311
You know what you're doing. I'll
give you that. Excellent form.

279
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:30,855
But how's your footwork?

280
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:32,982
If I step here.

281
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:35,025
Very good.

282
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:37,119
And now I step again.

283
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:43,232
Ta.

284
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:05,849
That is a wonderful trick.

285
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:09,759
Except, once again, you are
between me and my way out.

286
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:12,957
And now you have no weapon.

287
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:36,946
Who makes all these?

288
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:39,751
I do.

289
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:44,421
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

290
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:47,691
You need to find yourself
a girl, mate.

291
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:57,298
Or perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

292
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:58,707
is that you found one

293
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:03,180
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

294
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,444
You're not a eunuch, are you?

295
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:08,544
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate,

296
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:09,949
I can kill it!

297
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:28,255
You cheated.

298
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:29,596
Pirate.

299
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:34,298
Move away.

300
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:35,704
No.

301
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:37,469
-Please move.
-No.

302
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:40,569
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

303
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:45,812
This shot is not meant for you.

304
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:58,127
There he is! Over here!

305
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:02,457
Excellent work, Mr. Brown.

306
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:05,264
You've assisted in the capture
of a fugitive.

307
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:08,636
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

308
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:11,232
I trust you will
remember this is the day

309
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,939
Captain Jack Sparrow
almost escaped.

310
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:16,504
Take him away.

311
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,516
-Can you smell it?
-Come here.

312
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:25,279
-It's marrowbone.
-Come here.

313
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:27,150
-Want a juicy bone?
-Come here.

314
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:30,054
-Come here, boy!
-Come on.

315
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:34,060
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

316
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:35,254
Oh, excuse us

317
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,594
if we haven't resigned ourselves
to the gallows just yet.

318
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:46,701
There you go, miss.

319
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:49,402
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

320
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:52,139
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose.

321
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,773
I must admit,
I wasn't prepared for it.

322
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:58,808
I meant you being threatened by
that pirate. Sounds terrifying.

323
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,376
Oh.

324
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:02,217
Yes, it was terrifying.

325
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:05,554
But the commodore proposed.
Fancy that.

326
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:09,357
Now, that's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

327
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,160
It is a smart match.

328
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,224
He's a fine man.

329
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,694
He's what any woman should dream
of marrying.

330
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:23,039
Well, that Will Turner.
He's a fine man, too.

331
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,044
That is too bold.

332
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:29,014
Well, begging your pardon, miss.
It was not my place.

333
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:20,767
Has my daughter given you
an answer yet?

334
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:22,700
No, she hasn't.

335
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,739
Well, she has had
a very trying day.

336
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,968
Ghastly weather,
don't you think?

337
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:30,806
Bleak. Very bleak.

338
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:34,639
What's that?

339
00:29:34,715 --> 00:29:36,706
Cannon fire!

340
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:39,878
Return fire!

341
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:42,582
-I know those guns.
-Men to arms!

342
00:29:47,962 --> 00:29:49,953
It's the Pearl,

343
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,089
The Black Pearl?

344
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:55,865
I've heard stories.

345
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:59,702
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near 10 years.

346
00:29:59,774 --> 00:30:01,298
Never leaves any survivors.

347
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,639
No survivors?

348
00:30:03,711 --> 00:30:06,680
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

349
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,182
Coming through!

350
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:19,718
Aaah!

351
00:31:38,672 --> 00:31:40,105
Sight the muzzle flash!

352
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:41,334
Aim for the flashes!

353
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,273
I need a full strike,
fore and aft.

354
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:45,904
Mr. Stephens, more cartridges!

355
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,939
Governor, barricade yourself
in my office.

356
00:31:51,252 --> 00:31:53,584
That's an order.

357
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:12,436
Don't!

358
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:14,269
Hello, chum.

359
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:21,211
Up there.

360
00:32:29,723 --> 00:32:32,283
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you!

361
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,053
What?

362
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:35,095
You're the governor's daughter.

363
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,629
In here!

364
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:39,728
Listen.
They haven't seen you.

365
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,234
The first chance you get,
run to the fort.

366
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:52,267
Gotcha.

367
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,316
No! No! No!
It's hot!

368
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:01,479
You burned me!

369
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:02,783
Come on!

370
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:36,085
No!

371
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,036
We know you're here, poppet.

372
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,196
Poppet.

373
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:55,537
Come out and we promise
we won't hurt you.

374
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:56,769
Eh?

375
00:33:58,445 --> 00:34:01,573
We will find you, poppet.

376
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:06,984
You've got something of ours,
and it calls to us.

377
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:15,224
The gold calls to us.

378
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:17,661
Gold.

379
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,231
Hello, poppet.

380
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:27,296
Parley.

381
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:27,999
What?

382
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:29,235
Parley.

383
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,402
I invoke the right of parley.

384
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:34,747
According to the Code
of the Brethren
set down by the pirates Morgan
and Bartholomew,

385
00:34:34,815 --> 00:34:36,248
you have to take me
to your captain.

386
00:34:36,316 --> 00:34:37,908
I know the Code.

387
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:39,543
If an adversary demands parley,

388
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,918
you can do them no harm
until the parley is complete.

389
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:43,286
To blazes with the Code.

390
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:46,326
She wants to be taken
to the captain.

391
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:50,359
And she'll go without a fuss.

392
00:34:50,431 --> 00:34:53,457
We must honor the Code.

393
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,078
Say goodbye.

394
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,447
Goodbye.

395
00:35:15,189 --> 00:35:16,588
-Will!
-Come on!

396
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,056
Elizabeth.

397
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,859
Out of my way, scum!

398
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:42,347
My sympathies, friend.

399
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:44,646
You've no manner of luck at all.

400
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:07,771
Come on, doggy.

401
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:09,706
It's just you and me now.

402
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:12,142
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

403
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,941
Come on.
That's a boy.

404
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:16,175
Good boy.
Come get the bone.

405
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,842
That's a good boy.
Come on.

406
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:20,148
A bit closer.
A bit closer.

407
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,154
That's it.
That's it, doggy.

408
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,714
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur.

409
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,459
No, no!
I didn't mean it!

410
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,792
I didn't.

411
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:39,362
This ain't the armory.

412
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:44,673
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Twigg.

413
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,236
Captain Jack Sparrow.

414
00:36:47,981 --> 00:36:50,142
Last time I saw you,

415
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:54,813
you were all alone
on a godforsaken island,

416
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:57,049
shrinking into the distance.

417
00:36:57,124 --> 00:36:59,649
His fortunes aren't
improved much.

418
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:03,093
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

419
00:37:03,163 --> 00:37:08,267
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers
and mutineers.

420
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:14,070
So there is a curse.

421
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,600
That's interesting.

422
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:19,441
You know nothing of hell.

423
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,987
That's very interesting.

424
00:38:04,791 --> 00:38:07,624
I didn't know
we was taking on captives.

425
00:38:07,694 --> 00:38:10,857
She's invoked the right
of parley with Captain Barbossa.

426
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:14,662
-I'm here to --
-You'll speak when spoken to.

427
00:38:15,736 --> 00:38:17,203
And ye will not lay a hand

428
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:20,763
on those under the protection
of parley.

429
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:22,570
Aye, sir.

430
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:27,379
My apologies, miss.

431
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:30,978
Captain Barbossa,
I am here to negotiate

432
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:34,145
the cessation of hostilities
against Port Royal.

433
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:36,451
There were a lot
of long words in there.

434
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,617
We're naught but humble pirates.

435
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,320
What is it that you want?

436
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:43,625
I want you to leave
and never come back.

437
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:49,500
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

438
00:38:51,004 --> 00:38:52,665
Means "no."

439
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,770
Very well.

440
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:59,711
I'll drop it.

441
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,911
Me holds are bursting with swag.

442
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:08,682
That bit of shine matters to us?

443
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:10,450
Why?

444
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:14,392
It's what you've been searching
for. I recognize this ship.

445
00:39:14,461 --> 00:39:17,521
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England.

446
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:19,963
Did you, now?

447
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:23,499
Fine.

448
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,299
I suppose if it is worthless,

449
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:27,465
there's no point
in me keeping it.

450
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:41,653
You have a name, missy?

451
00:39:42,622 --> 00:39:45,614
Elizabeth Turner.

452
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:49,026
I'm a maid
in the governor's household.

453
00:39:51,631 --> 00:39:53,826
Miss Turner.

454
00:39:55,635 --> 00:39:57,364
Bootstrap.

455
00:40:00,974 --> 00:40:03,602
How does a maid own
a trinket such as that?

456
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:07,113
Family heirloom, perhaps?

457
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,115
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

458
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:11,548
Very well.
Hand it over.

459
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:15,645
We'll put your town to our
rudder and ne'er return.

460
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:30,430
Our bargain?

461
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,164
Still the guns and stow them.

462
00:40:36,376 --> 00:40:39,368
Wait!
You have to take me to shore!

463
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:40,811
According to the Code --

464
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:45,477
First, your return to shore
was not part of our agreement.

465
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:46,814
So I must do nothing.

466
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:49,822
You must be a pirate for
the Pirate's Code to apply,

467
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,822
and you're not.

468
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:54,554
Thirdly, the Code is more
what you'd call guidelines

469
00:40:54,628 --> 00:40:56,289
than actual rules.

470
00:40:56,363 --> 00:41:00,129
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

471
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:23,154
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

472
00:41:23,223 --> 00:41:26,351
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

473
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:28,951
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

474
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,554
And where do you propose
we start?

475
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:34,259
If you have information
concerning my daughter,

476
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:36,268
please share it.

477
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:41,935
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl,

478
00:41:42,008 --> 00:41:44,602
Mentioned it
is more what he did.

479
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:48,537
Ask him where it is.
He could lead us to it.

480
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:52,073
No. The pirates
who invaded this fort

481
00:41:52,152 --> 00:41:56,612
left Sparrow locked in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

482
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,591
We will establish
their most likely course.

483
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,559
That's not good enough!

484
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:05,462
Mr. Turner, you are not
a military man.

485
00:42:05,532 --> 00:42:07,193
You are not a sailor.

486
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:09,566
You are a blacksmith.

487
00:42:09,636 --> 00:42:13,299
And this is not the moment
for rash actions.

488
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,467
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

489
00:42:16,543 --> 00:42:20,104
you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

490
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:33,823
You. Sparrow.

491
00:42:33,894 --> 00:42:36,920
You are familiar with that ship.
The Black Pearl,

492
00:42:36,997 --> 00:42:37,929
I've heard of it.

493
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:41,525
Where does it make berth?

494
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,092
Have you not heard the stories?

495
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,475
Captain Barbossa
and his crew of miscreants

496
00:42:49,543 --> 00:42:52,171
sail from the dreaded
isla de Muerta.

497
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:53,837
It's an island
that cannot be found,

498
00:42:53,914 --> 00:42:57,782
except by those
who already know where it is.

499
00:42:57,851 --> 00:43:00,285
The ship's real enough.

500
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:02,287
It's anchorage
must be a real place.

501
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:03,754
Where is it?

502
00:43:03,823 --> 00:43:05,882
Why ask me?

503
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,426
Because you're a pirate.

504
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:10,327
And you want to turn pirate
yourself, is that it?

505
00:43:11,431 --> 00:43:12,420
Never.

506
00:43:16,102 --> 00:43:17,330
They took Miss Swann.

507
00:43:17,404 --> 00:43:19,770
Oh, so it is
that you found a girl.

508
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,967
I see. Well, if you're intending
to brave all,

509
00:43:23,043 --> 00:43:27,275
hasten to her rescue,
and so win fair lady's heart,

510
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:29,611
you'll have to
do it alone, mate.

511
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:32,117
I see no profit in it for me.

512
00:43:32,185 --> 00:43:33,652
I can get you out of here.

513
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,915
How's that?
They key's run off.

514
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,581
I helped build these cells.

515
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,887
These are
half-pin barrel hinges.

516
00:43:41,294 --> 00:43:45,196
With the right leverage and the
proper application of strength.

517
00:43:45,632 --> 00:43:47,725
The door will lift free.

518
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:51,427
What's your name?

519
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,734
Will Turner.

520
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:56,207
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

521
00:43:56,276 --> 00:43:58,369
Good, strong name.

522
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:01,209
No doubt named for your father.

523
00:44:02,082 --> 00:44:03,174
Yes.

524
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:05,843
Uh-huh.

525
00:44:05,919 --> 00:44:09,218
Well, Mr. Turner,
I've changed me mind.

526
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:12,554
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear on pain of death

527
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:14,594
I shall take you
to the Black Pearl

528
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:16,754
and your bonny lass.

529
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,196
Do we have an accord?

530
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:22,661
Agreed.

531
00:44:22,736 --> 00:44:23,668
Agreed.

532
00:44:23,737 --> 00:44:25,364
Get me out.

533
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:29,965
Hurry.
Someone will have heard that.

534
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,273
Not without my effects.

535
00:44:38,785 --> 00:44:40,548
We're going to steal the ship?

536
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,151
That ship?

537
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:45,020
Commandeer.

538
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:47,355
We're going to commandeer
that ship.

539
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:49,361
Nautical term.

540
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:51,329
One question
about your business.

541
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:52,763
Or there's no use going.

542
00:44:52,832 --> 00:44:54,459
This girl.

543
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:57,196
How far are you willing
to go to save her?

544
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,703
I'd die for her.

545
00:44:58,772 --> 00:45:00,034
Oh, good.

546
00:45:00,106 --> 00:45:01,903
No worries, then.

547
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,327
This is either madness
or brilliance.

548
00:45:24,397 --> 00:45:29,061
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

549
00:45:57,497 --> 00:46:01,399
Everyone stay calm!
We are taking over the ship.

550
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:03,459
Aye! Avast!

551
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:09,466
This ship cannot be crewed
by two men.

552
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:12,204
You'll never make it
out of the bay.

553
00:46:12,278 --> 00:46:16,942
Son, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

554
00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:18,574
Savvy?

555
00:46:22,122 --> 00:46:23,146
Commodore.

556
00:46:23,223 --> 00:46:26,124
Sir,
they've taken the Dauntless!

557
00:46:27,594 --> 00:46:29,323
Commodore!

558
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:31,886
They've taken the ship!

559
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:34,195
Sparrow and Turner
have taken the Dauntless!

560
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:38,135
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

561
00:46:38,938 --> 00:46:43,773
That is without doubt the worst
pirate I have ever seen.

562
00:46:46,246 --> 00:46:47,770
Here they come.

563
00:46:52,418 --> 00:46:55,785
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

564
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:05,262
Search every cabin, every hull,
down to the bilges.

565
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,311
Sailors,
back to the Interceptor,

566
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:23,440
Now!

567
00:47:29,522 --> 00:47:33,390
Thank you, Commodore, for
getting us ready to make way.

568
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:36,758
We'd have had a hard time of it
by ourselves.

569
00:47:39,265 --> 00:47:41,631
Set topsails
and clear up this mess.

570
00:47:41,701 --> 00:47:43,635
With the wind,
we won't catch them.

571
00:47:43,703 --> 00:47:46,501
I don't need to. Get them
in range of the long nines.

572
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:48,336
Hands, come about!

573
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:50,569
Run out the guns!

574
00:47:50,643 --> 00:47:53,237
We are to fire
on our own ship, sir?

575
00:47:53,313 --> 00:47:55,304
I'd rather see her
at the bottom of the ocean

576
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:57,372
than in the hands of a pirate.

577
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:02,479
Commodore, he's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

578
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,516
Abandon ship!

579
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:17,428
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

580
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,097
So it would seem.

581
00:48:28,646 --> 00:48:30,671
When I was a lad
living in England,

582
00:48:30,748 --> 00:48:32,682
my mother raised me by herself.

583
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:37,380
After she died, I came out here,
looking for my father.

584
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:39,957
Is that so?

585
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,894
My father, Will Turner.

586
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,954
It was only after you learnt
my name you agreed to help.

587
00:48:47,031 --> 00:48:49,397
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

588
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,458
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

589
00:48:51,536 --> 00:48:53,561
You knew my father.

590
00:48:59,577 --> 00:49:00,839
I knew him.

591
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:04,075
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

592
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:07,242
Everyone else called him
Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.

593
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:09,149
Bootstrap?

594
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,780
Good man.
Good pirate.

595
00:49:11,856 --> 00:49:13,949
I swear, you look just like him.

596
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:15,049
It's not true.

597
00:49:15,126 --> 00:49:17,026
He was a merchant sailor.

598
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:19,256
A respectable man
who obeyed the law.

599
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,766
He was a bloody pirate.
A scallywag.

600
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,702
My father was not a pirate.

601
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:30,764
Put it away, son. It's not worth
you getting beat again.

602
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,777
You ignored the rules
of engagement.

603
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,335
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

604
00:49:35,413 --> 00:49:38,439
Then that's not much incentive
for me to fight fair.

605
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:48,889
Now, as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

606
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,827
The only rules
that really matter are these.

607
00:49:51,896 --> 00:49:55,354
What a man can do
and what a man can't do.

608
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:56,798
For instance,

609
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:00,360
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man

610
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:01,598
or you can't.

611
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:03,106
Pirate is in your blood,

612
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:05,768
so you'll have to square
with that someday.

613
00:50:05,843 --> 00:50:07,003
Now, me, for example.

614
00:50:07,078 --> 00:50:08,978
I can let you drown.

615
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,277
But I can't bring this ship
into Tortuga

616
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:12,782
all by me onesy, savvy?

617
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,147
So.

618
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:22,481
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

619
00:50:23,628 --> 00:50:25,528
Or can you not?

620
00:50:27,665 --> 00:50:29,565
Tortuga?

621
00:50:29,634 --> 00:50:31,033
Tortuga.

622
00:50:53,157 --> 00:50:55,682
More importantly,
it is indeed a sad life

623
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,729
that has never breathed deep
this sweet bouquet

624
00:50:58,796 --> 00:51:00,957
that is Tortuga, savvy?

625
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:04,160
What do you think?

626
00:51:07,538 --> 00:51:08,596
it'll linger.

627
00:51:08,673 --> 00:51:10,368
I'll tell you, mate,

628
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:13,239
if every town in the world
were like this one,

629
00:51:13,311 --> 00:51:16,678
no man would ever feel unwanted.

630
00:51:16,748 --> 00:51:18,238
Scarlett!

631
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:22,246
Not sure I deserved that.

632
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:24,612
Giselle!

633
00:51:24,689 --> 00:51:25,621
Who was she?

634
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:26,554
What?

635
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,960
I may have deserved that.

636
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:35,489
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

637
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:39,935
Mother's love!

638
00:51:40,004 --> 00:51:41,904
Jack!

639
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:45,204
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleeping.

640
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:46,607
It's bad luck.

641
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:48,975
Fortunately,
I know how to counter it.

642
00:51:49,046 --> 00:51:50,308
The man who did the waking

643
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:52,645
buys the man who was sleeping
a drink.

644
00:51:52,717 --> 00:51:55,515
The man who was sleeping drinks
while listening to a proposition

645
00:51:55,586 --> 00:51:57,884
from the man who did the waking.

646
00:51:59,957 --> 00:52:02,619
Aye, that'll about do it.

647
00:52:06,764 --> 00:52:08,994
Blast!
I'm already awake!

648
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:11,034
That was for the smell.

649
00:52:20,878 --> 00:52:22,812
Keep a sharp eye.

650
00:52:29,554 --> 00:52:33,780
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of yourn?

651
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:37,121
I'm going after the Black Pearl,

652
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:45,402
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

653
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:48,633
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

654
00:52:48,706 --> 00:52:52,039
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl,

655
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:55,203
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

656
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:57,679
All I need is a crew.

657
00:52:57,748 --> 00:52:59,272
From what I hear of Barbossa,

658
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,183
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one.

659
00:53:02,253 --> 00:53:04,721
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool.

660
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,381
Prove me wrong.

661
00:53:06,457 --> 00:53:09,949
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

662
00:53:10,027 --> 00:53:12,860
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage.

663
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,207
The kid?

664
00:53:32,149 --> 00:53:36,176
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

665
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,722
His only child, savvy?

666
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:40,689
Is he, now?

667
00:53:43,628 --> 00:53:46,028
"Leverage," says you.

668
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,032
"l think I feel a change
in the wind," says I.

669
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,658
I'll find us a crew.

670
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:53,499
There's bound to be some sailors
crazy as you.

671
00:53:53,571 --> 00:53:55,766
One can only hope.

672
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,932
Take what you can.

673
00:53:57,008 --> 00:53:59,441
Give nothing back.

674
00:54:23,467 --> 00:54:25,367
You'll be dining
with the captain.

675
00:54:25,436 --> 00:54:28,564
And he requests you wear this.

676
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:29,833
You tell the captain

677
00:54:29,907 --> 00:54:33,308
that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

678
00:54:33,377 --> 00:54:35,743
He said you'd say that.

679
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:38,281
He also said,
if that be the case,

680
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:40,180
you'll be dining with the crew.

681
00:54:40,251 --> 00:54:42,719
And you'll be naked.

682
00:54:48,392 --> 00:54:49,484
Fine.

683
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,743
There's no need to stand on
ceremony, nor call to impress.

684
00:55:10,815 --> 00:55:12,874
You must be hungry.

685
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:31,467
Try the wine.

686
00:55:35,773 --> 00:55:36,831
And the apples.

687
00:55:36,907 --> 00:55:39,137
One of those next?

688
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:48,612
It's poisoned.

689
00:55:50,254 --> 00:55:52,449
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

690
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:54,115
Release me.
You have your trinket.

691
00:55:54,191 --> 00:55:56,716
I'm of no further value to you.

692
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:03,558
You don't know what this is,
do you?

693
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:05,295
It's a pirate medallion.

694
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:08,805
This is Aztec gold.

695
00:56:08,873 --> 00:56:11,398
One of 882 identical pieces

696
00:56:11,475 --> 00:56:16,174
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortes himself.

697
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,374
Blood money paid
to stem the slaughter

698
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:21,077
he wreaked upon them
with his armies.

699
00:56:21,152 --> 00:56:24,485
But the greed of Cortes
was insatiable.

700
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:32,223
So the heathen gods placed
upon the gold a terrible curse.

701
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,722
Any mortal that removes

702
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,200
but a single piece
from that stone chest

703
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,670
shall be punished for eternity.

704
00:56:43,174 --> 00:56:46,575
I hardly believe in ghost
stories anymore, Captain.

705
00:56:46,644 --> 00:56:48,544
Aye.

706
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:52,207
That's exactly what I thought
when we were told the tale.

707
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,047
Buried on an island of dead
what cannot be found,

708
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,815
except for those
who know where it is.

709
00:56:58,723 --> 00:57:00,520
Find it, we did.

710
00:57:01,726 --> 00:57:03,489
There be the chest.

711
00:57:03,561 --> 00:57:05,927
Inside be the gold.

712
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:08,396
And we took them all.

713
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,559
We spent them and traded them

714
00:57:10,634 --> 00:57:13,125
and frittered them away
on drink and food

715
00:57:13,204 --> 00:57:14,967
and pleasurable company.

716
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:21,239
The more we gave them away,
the more we came to realize,

717
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:24,406
the drink would not satisfy,

718
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:28,009
food turned to ash
in our mouths,

719
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:30,414
and all the pleasurable company
in the world

720
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,979
could not slake our lust.

721
00:57:34,592 --> 00:57:37,993
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

722
00:57:38,963 --> 00:57:45,095
Compelled by greed, we were,
but now we are consumed by it.

723
00:57:56,247 --> 00:57:59,910
There is one way
we can end our curse.

724
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,283
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

725
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:10,919
must be restored
and the blood repaid.

726
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:17,331
Thanks to ye,
we have the final piece.

727
00:58:18,602 --> 00:58:20,866
And the blood to be repaid?

728
00:58:20,938 --> 00:58:26,001
That's why there's no sense
to be killin' you yet.

729
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:29,539
Apple?

730
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:36,777
Arr!

731
00:58:37,922 --> 00:58:39,549
No!

732
00:58:45,729 --> 00:58:46,787
I'm curious.

733
00:58:46,864 --> 00:58:50,391
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

734
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:58,798
Aah!

735
00:59:48,325 --> 00:59:49,121
Aaaah!

736
00:59:54,198 --> 00:59:55,460
Look!

737
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:59,093
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

738
00:59:59,169 --> 01:00:02,364
We are not among the living,
and so we cannot die.

739
01:00:02,439 --> 01:00:04,634
But neither are we dead.

740
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:09,268
For too long I've been parched
and unable to quench it.

741
01:00:09,346 --> 01:00:14,206
Too long I've been starving
to death and haven't died.

742
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:16,617
I feel nothing.

743
01:00:16,687 --> 01:00:20,453
Not the wind on my face
nor the spray of the sea

744
01:00:20,524 --> 01:00:24,119
nor the warmth
of a woman's flesh.

745
01:00:24,895 --> 01:00:28,661
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

746
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:30,461
You're in one!

747
01:00:48,852 --> 01:00:53,756
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

748
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,930
Feast your eyes, Captain.

749
01:01:01,999 --> 01:01:04,559
All of them faithful hands
before the mast.

750
01:01:04,635 --> 01:01:07,968
Every man worth his salt.

751
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:10,029
And crazy to boot.

752
01:01:10,107 --> 01:01:13,565
So this is
your able-bodied crew?

753
01:01:19,149 --> 01:01:21,276
-You, sailor!
-Cotton, sir.

754
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:25,049
Mr. Cotton, do you have
the courage to follow orders

755
01:01:25,122 --> 01:01:28,114
and stay true in the face
of danger and death?

756
01:01:28,192 --> 01:01:31,457
Mr. Cotton!
Answer, man!

757
01:01:31,528 --> 01:01:34,156
He's a mute. Poor devil
had his tongue cut out.

758
01:01:34,231 --> 01:01:36,495
He trained the parrot
to talk for him.

759
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,001
No one's yet figured how.

760
01:01:41,638 --> 01:01:44,471
Mr. Cotton's parrot.

761
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:45,803
Same question.

762
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:49,277
Wind in the sails!
Wind in the sails!

763
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,079
Mostly we figure
that means "yes."

764
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:53,343
Of course it does.

765
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:55,282
Satisfied?

766
01:01:55,352 --> 01:01:57,513
Well, you've proved they're mad.

767
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,079
And what's the benefit for us?

768
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:11,664
Anamaria.

769
01:02:13,437 --> 01:02:15,234
I suppose
you didn't deserve that.

770
01:02:15,305 --> 01:02:17,239
No, that one I deserved.

771
01:02:17,307 --> 01:02:19,502
You stole my boat!

772
01:02:19,576 --> 01:02:22,238
Actually --

773
01:02:22,312 --> 01:02:25,110
Borrowed.
Borrowed without permission.

774
01:02:25,182 --> 01:02:27,207
But with every intention
of bringing it back.

775
01:02:27,284 --> 01:02:28,774
But you didn't!

776
01:02:28,852 --> 01:02:31,719
You'll get another one.

777
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:32,619
I will.

778
01:02:32,689 --> 01:02:34,179
A better one.

779
01:02:34,258 --> 01:02:35,919
A better one!

780
01:02:35,993 --> 01:02:36,789
That one.

781
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,487
What one?

782
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:42,227
That one?

783
01:02:45,035 --> 01:02:46,798
Aye, that one.

784
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,462
-What say you?
-Aye!

785
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:49,938
Aye!

786
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:51,804
Anchors aweigh!

787
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:56,175
No, no, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

788
01:02:56,246 --> 01:02:58,476
it'll be far worse
not to have her.

789
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:35,744
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find

790
01:03:35,819 --> 01:03:37,753
with a compass
that doesn't work?

791
01:03:37,821 --> 01:03:39,914
Aye, the compass
doesn't point North,

792
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:43,551
but we're not trying
to find North, are we?

793
01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:55,871
We should drop canvas, sir.

794
01:03:55,939 --> 01:03:58,772
She can hold a bit longer.

795
01:04:00,177 --> 01:04:03,806
What's in your head that's
put you in such a fine mood?

796
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:05,849
We're catching up.

797
01:04:20,531 --> 01:04:22,863
Time to go, poppet.

798
01:04:22,933 --> 01:04:26,300
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

799
01:05:18,217 --> 01:05:23,519
Dead men tell no tales.

800
01:05:25,258 --> 01:05:26,657
Puts a chill in the bones

801
01:05:26,726 --> 01:05:30,662
how many honest sailors have
been claimed by this passage.

802
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:47,678
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

803
01:05:47,747 --> 01:05:50,841
Not a lot's known about Jack
fore he showed up in Tortuga

804
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:53,784
with a mind to go after the
treasure of the isla de Muerta.

805
01:05:53,853 --> 01:05:55,115
That was before I'd met him.

806
01:05:55,188 --> 01:05:58,180
Back when he was Captain
of the Black Pearl,

807
01:05:58,257 --> 01:05:59,246
What?

808
01:06:02,729 --> 01:06:04,390
He failed to mention that.

809
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:06,694
He plays things
closer to the vest now.

810
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:08,825
And a hard-learned lesson
it was.

811
01:06:08,901 --> 01:06:11,369
Three days out,
the first mate comes to him

812
01:06:11,437 --> 01:06:13,496
and says everything's
an equal share.

813
01:06:13,573 --> 01:06:16,041
That should mean the location
of the treasure.

814
01:06:16,109 --> 01:06:18,407
Jack gives up the bearings.

815
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:21,641
That night, there was a mutiny.

816
01:06:21,714 --> 01:06:24,842
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die,

817
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:28,011
but not before he'd gone mad
with the heat.

818
01:06:31,357 --> 01:06:33,791
So that's the reason
for all the...

819
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:38,329
Reason's got nothing
to do with it.

820
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:40,661
Now, Will,
when a pirate's marooned,

821
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:43,793
he's a given a pistol with
a single shot. One shot.

822
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:46,998
Well, that won't do much good
hunting or to be rescued.

823
01:06:47,073 --> 01:06:50,509
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

824
01:06:50,576 --> 01:06:53,670
that pistol will start
to look real friendly.

825
01:06:53,746 --> 01:06:57,341
But Jack escaped the island, and
he still has that single shot.

826
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:00,852
Oh, he won't use it,
though, save on one man.

827
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,047
His mutinous first mate.

828
01:07:03,122 --> 01:07:05,454
-Barbossa.
-Aye.

829
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:08,021
How did Jack get off the island?

830
01:07:08,094 --> 01:07:09,618
Well, I'll tell ye.

831
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,492
He waded out into the shallows.

832
01:07:11,564 --> 01:07:14,032
He waited there
three days and three nights

833
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,931
till all manner of sea creatures

834
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:18,766
'came acclimated
to his presence.

835
01:07:18,838 --> 01:07:20,567
And on the fourth morning,

836
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,767
he roped
a couple of sea turtles,

837
01:07:22,842 --> 01:07:26,073
lashed them together,
and made a raft.

838
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:28,842
He roped a couple
of sea turtles?

839
01:07:28,915 --> 01:07:31,577
Aye, sea turtles.

840
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,053
What did he use for rope?

841
01:07:40,326 --> 01:07:42,521
Human hair.

842
01:07:42,595 --> 01:07:44,392
From my back.

843
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:46,558
Let go the anchor!

844
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:49,066
Aye, Captain, aye!

845
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:52,102
Young Mr. Turner and l
are to go ashore.

846
01:07:52,171 --> 01:07:55,800
Captain, what if the worst
should happen?

847
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,001
Keep to the Code.

848
01:07:57,076 --> 01:07:59,169
Aye, the Code.

849
01:08:24,303 --> 01:08:25,497
Move.

850
01:08:25,571 --> 01:08:27,869
10 years of hoarding swag.

851
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:30,431
And now we finally
get to spend it.

852
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:40,851
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men.

853
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,617
You can buy an eye what actually
fits and is made of glass.

854
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:47,659
This one does splinter
something terrible.

855
01:08:48,494 --> 01:08:50,655
Stop rubbing it.

856
01:09:09,172 --> 01:09:12,164
What Code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

857
01:09:12,242 --> 01:09:14,369
Pirate's Code.

858
01:09:14,444 --> 01:09:19,074
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

859
01:09:19,749 --> 01:09:22,684
No heroes amongst thieves?

860
01:09:23,353 --> 01:09:25,821
For having such
a bleak outlook on pirates,

861
01:09:25,889 --> 01:09:28,756
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

862
01:09:28,825 --> 01:09:31,760
Sprung a man from jail,

863
01:09:31,828 --> 01:09:34,194
commandeered a ship
of the fleet,

864
01:09:34,264 --> 01:09:37,597
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga.

865
01:09:39,302 --> 01:09:42,669
And you're completely
obsessed with treasure.

866
01:09:45,408 --> 01:09:49,777
That's not true.
I am not obsessed with treasure.

867
01:09:56,253 --> 01:09:59,017
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

868
01:09:59,089 --> 01:10:01,887
Gentlemen, the time has come!.

869
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:04,950
Our salvation is nigh!

870
01:10:05,829 --> 01:10:07,888
Our torment is near an end.

871
01:10:07,964 --> 01:10:09,556
Elizabeth.

872
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:12,227
For 10 years
we've been tested and tried,

873
01:10:12,302 --> 01:10:14,099
and each man jack of you here

874
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:17,537
has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

875
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:20,269
and a hundred times again!

876
01:10:21,778 --> 01:10:24,076
Suffered, I have!

877
01:10:24,147 --> 01:10:27,480
Punished, we were,
the lot of us.

878
01:10:27,551 --> 01:10:31,647
Disproportionate to our crime!

879
01:10:32,856 --> 01:10:34,824
Here it is!

880
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:41,390
The cursed treasure
of Cortes himself.

881
01:10:43,066 --> 01:10:47,730
Every last piece that went
astray, we have returned.

882
01:10:47,804 --> 01:10:49,465
Save for this.

883
01:10:49,539 --> 01:10:50,972
Jack!

884
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:54,841
Not yet. We wait
for the opportune moment.

885
01:10:54,911 --> 01:10:59,075
881 we found, but despaired
of ever finding the last.

886
01:10:59,149 --> 01:11:00,946
When's that?

887
01:11:01,017 --> 01:11:03,542
When it's
of greatest profit to you?

888
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:06,350
May I ask you something?

889
01:11:06,423 --> 01:11:10,052
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

890
01:11:10,126 --> 01:11:11,457
Do us a favor.

891
01:11:11,528 --> 01:11:15,487
I know it's difficult for you,
but please stay here

892
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:18,557
and try not to do
anything stupid.

893
01:11:21,104 --> 01:11:25,231
And who among us has paid
the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

894
01:11:25,308 --> 01:11:25,967
Us!

895
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:28,875
And whose blood
must yet be paid?

896
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:30,606
Hers!

897
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:35,146
You know the first thing
I'm gonna do

898
01:11:35,218 --> 01:11:38,085
after the curse is lifted?

899
01:11:39,656 --> 01:11:43,183
Eat a whole bushel of apples.

900
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,893
Begun by blood.

901
01:11:52,969 --> 01:11:55,699
By blood undone.

902
01:11:59,376 --> 01:12:03,073
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not gonna be your leverage.

903
01:12:12,389 --> 01:12:14,619
That's it?

904
01:12:14,691 --> 01:12:16,215
Waste not.

905
01:12:54,297 --> 01:12:55,525
Did it work?

906
01:12:56,366 --> 01:12:59,199
-I don't feel no different.
-How do we tell?

907
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:08,238
You're not dead.

908
01:13:08,311 --> 01:13:09,778
No.

909
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:12,048
He shot me!

910
01:13:12,115 --> 01:13:13,605
It didn't work.

911
01:13:13,683 --> 01:13:16,345
The curse it still upon us!

912
01:13:20,356 --> 01:13:23,189
You, maid!
Your father, what was his name?

913
01:13:23,259 --> 01:13:26,057
Was your father William Turner?

914
01:13:26,129 --> 01:13:27,096
No.

915
01:13:27,163 --> 01:13:30,758
Where's his child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

916
01:13:30,834 --> 01:13:34,429
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

917
01:13:41,511 --> 01:13:43,536
You two!

918
01:13:43,613 --> 01:13:46,946
You brought us the wrong person!

919
01:13:47,016 --> 01:13:48,313
No!

920
01:13:48,384 --> 01:13:51,182
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

921
01:13:51,254 --> 01:13:53,722
She said her name was Turner.

922
01:13:55,759 --> 01:13:57,624
I think she lied to us.

923
01:13:59,829 --> 01:14:02,627
You brought us here for nothing.

924
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:06,328
I won't take questioning or
second guesses from you, Twigg.

925
01:14:06,402 --> 01:14:07,630
Who's to blame?

926
01:14:07,704 --> 01:14:11,367
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse.

927
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:15,435
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

928
01:14:15,512 --> 01:14:17,605
Yeah!

929
01:14:19,349 --> 01:14:22,648
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place.

930
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:27,816
If any coward here dare
challenge me, let him speak!

931
01:14:28,591 --> 01:14:32,357
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood,

932
01:14:32,428 --> 01:14:33,292
just in case.

933
01:14:33,363 --> 01:14:34,853
Yeah!

934
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:44,667
The medallion!

935
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:46,072
She's taken it!

936
01:14:46,142 --> 01:14:50,579
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

937
01:14:54,584 --> 01:14:56,279
No oars here!

938
01:14:56,352 --> 01:14:58,718
Where's the oars?

939
01:14:58,788 --> 01:15:00,983
The oars have gone missing.

940
01:15:01,057 --> 01:15:02,752
Find them!

941
01:15:06,496 --> 01:15:08,657
Find the oars!

942
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,863
You.

943
01:15:14,037 --> 01:15:15,868
You're supposed to be dead!

944
01:15:15,939 --> 01:15:17,736
Am I not?

945
01:15:27,183 --> 01:15:29,879
Palulay.

946
01:15:29,953 --> 01:15:32,353
Palu-li-la-la-lulu.

947
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:36,588
Parlili.

948
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:41,722
Parsnip, parsley,
partner, partner.

949
01:15:41,798 --> 01:15:42,560
Parley?

950
01:15:42,632 --> 01:15:44,964
That's the one!
Parley!

951
01:15:45,034 --> 01:15:46,194
Parley!

952
01:15:46,269 --> 01:15:48,635
Parley?

953
01:15:48,705 --> 01:15:53,642
Damn to the depths whatever man
that thought up "parley"!

954
01:15:54,477 --> 01:15:56,342
That would be the French.

955
01:16:08,024 --> 01:16:09,548
Not more pirates.

956
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:11,992
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

957
01:16:12,595 --> 01:16:14,290
Mr. Gibbs?

958
01:16:14,364 --> 01:16:16,662
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

959
01:16:16,733 --> 01:16:18,166
Jack?

960
01:16:18,234 --> 01:16:20,794
Jack Sparrow?

961
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:22,895
He fell behind.

962
01:16:29,712 --> 01:16:31,270
Keep to the Code.

963
01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:33,946
Weigh anchor!

964
01:16:34,017 --> 01:16:37,145
Hoist the sails!
Make quick!

965
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:47,061
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

966
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:51,131
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

967
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,363
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

968
01:16:55,405 --> 01:16:58,397
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

969
01:16:58,474 --> 01:17:03,173
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

970
01:17:03,246 --> 01:17:06,272
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

971
01:17:06,349 --> 01:17:08,681
Aye.

972
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:09,877
Kill him.

973
01:17:11,554 --> 01:17:14,523
The girl's blood
didn't work, did it?

974
01:17:16,225 --> 01:17:18,352
Hold your fire!

975
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,431
You know whose blood we need.

976
01:17:28,471 --> 01:17:31,235
I know whose blood you need.

977
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:40,280
What sort of a man trades
a man's life for a ship?

978
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:41,510
Pirate.

979
01:17:42,518 --> 01:17:45,544
Here. Let me.

980
01:17:45,621 --> 01:17:47,282
Thank you.

981
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:51,958
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

982
01:17:53,262 --> 01:17:54,024
Why?

983
01:17:57,266 --> 01:17:58,665
I don't know.

984
01:18:00,503 --> 01:18:03,438
I'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands.
I know they're rough.

985
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:07,499
No.
I mean yes, they are, but...

986
01:18:09,946 --> 01:18:12,881
But don't stop.

987
01:18:20,223 --> 01:18:21,884
Elizabeth.

988
01:18:37,607 --> 01:18:39,336
It's yours.

989
01:18:43,246 --> 01:18:46,738
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

990
01:18:46,816 --> 01:18:49,250
It was a gift from my father.

991
01:18:49,318 --> 01:18:51,149
He sent it to me.

992
01:18:55,525 --> 01:18:57,618
Why did you take it?

993
01:18:59,629 --> 01:19:03,224
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

994
01:19:04,067 --> 01:19:05,932
That would have been awful.

995
01:19:09,272 --> 01:19:11,866
It wasn't your blood
they needed.

996
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:16,644
It was my father's blood.

997
01:19:18,481 --> 01:19:20,108
My blood.

998
01:19:26,022 --> 01:19:27,512
The blood of a pirate.

999
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:30,184
Will, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

1000
01:19:43,106 --> 01:19:45,131
You expect to leave me
on some beach

1001
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:48,439
with nothing but a name and
your word it's the one I need

1002
01:19:48,511 --> 01:19:52,174
and watch you sail away
in my ship?

1003
01:19:52,248 --> 01:19:53,237
No.

1004
01:19:53,316 --> 01:19:55,784
I expect to leave you
standing on some beach

1005
01:19:55,852 --> 01:19:57,615
with absolutely no name at all,

1006
01:19:57,687 --> 01:20:00,247
watching me sail away
on my ship,

1007
01:20:00,323 --> 01:20:02,723
and then I'll shout the name
back to you.

1008
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:04,123
Savvy?

1009
01:20:04,193 --> 01:20:06,855
That still leaves the problem
of me on some beach

1010
01:20:06,929 --> 01:20:09,261
with naught but a name
and your word

1011
01:20:09,332 --> 01:20:11,823
it's the one I need.

1012
01:20:11,901 --> 01:20:13,698
Of the two of us,

1013
01:20:13,769 --> 01:20:17,398
I'm the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

1014
01:20:17,473 --> 01:20:21,466
Therefore, my word is the one
we'll be trusting.

1015
01:20:21,544 --> 01:20:25,981
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

1016
01:20:26,048 --> 01:20:29,142
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

1017
01:20:29,218 --> 01:20:32,881
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

1018
01:20:33,923 --> 01:20:35,823
Funny old world, isn't it?

1019
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:41,586
Captain, we're coming up
on the Interceptor,

1020
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:57,304
I'm having a thought here,
Barbossa.

1021
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:59,314
What say we run up
a flag of truce,

1022
01:20:59,382 --> 01:21:01,213
I scurry over
to the Interceptor,

1023
01:21:01,284 --> 01:21:05,050
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

1024
01:21:05,121 --> 01:21:09,116
Now, that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl,

1025
01:21:09,192 --> 01:21:13,026
People are easy to search
when they're dead.

1026
01:21:13,095 --> 01:21:14,892
Lock him in the brig.

1027
01:21:27,176 --> 01:21:29,201
Hands aloft to loose t'gallants!

1028
01:21:29,278 --> 01:21:32,475
With this wind, she'll carry
every sail we've got!

1029
01:21:32,548 --> 01:21:33,572
What's happening?

1030
01:21:33,649 --> 01:21:37,050
The Black Pearl,
She's gaining on us.

1031
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:43,090
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

1032
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:46,219
You can tell them that
after they've caught us.

1033
01:21:46,295 --> 01:21:48,092
We're shallower on the draft?

1034
01:21:48,164 --> 01:21:48,994
Aye.

1035
01:21:49,065 --> 01:21:52,000
Well, then can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

1036
01:21:53,135 --> 01:21:55,831
We don't have to outrun them
long, just long enough.

1037
01:21:55,905 --> 01:21:58,430
Lighten the ship, stem to stern!

1038
01:21:58,507 --> 01:22:02,238
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost.

1039
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,120
Apparently, there's a leak.

1040
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:31,237
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

1041
01:22:31,307 --> 01:22:34,208
And run out the sweeps.

1042
01:22:34,277 --> 01:22:36,040
-Pull!
-Ho!

1043
01:23:01,337 --> 01:23:03,498
We're gonna need that.

1044
01:23:11,414 --> 01:23:12,972
It was a good plan.

1045
01:23:13,049 --> 01:23:14,573
Up till now.

1046
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:15,912
Gibbs!

1047
01:23:15,985 --> 01:23:17,816
We have to make a stand.

1048
01:23:17,887 --> 01:23:19,821
We must fight!

1049
01:23:19,889 --> 01:23:21,049
Load the guns!

1050
01:23:21,123 --> 01:23:22,215
With what?

1051
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:24,191
Anything. Everything!

1052
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,285
Anything we have left.

1053
01:23:27,663 --> 01:23:29,597
Load the guns!

1054
01:23:29,665 --> 01:23:31,326
Case shot and langrage!

1055
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,766
Nails and crushed glass!

1056
01:23:35,604 --> 01:23:37,504
With a will!

1057
01:23:58,094 --> 01:24:00,824
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

1058
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:03,626
She'll rake us without
ever presenting a target.

1059
01:24:03,699 --> 01:24:05,690
Lower the anchor
on the right side.

1060
01:24:06,335 --> 01:24:08,462
On the starboard side!

1061
01:24:08,537 --> 01:24:10,300
It has the element of surprise.

1062
01:24:10,373 --> 01:24:12,898
You're daft, lady!
You both are!

1063
01:24:12,975 --> 01:24:14,909
Daft like Jack!

1064
01:24:14,977 --> 01:24:17,207
Lower the starboard anchor!

1065
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:21,238
Do it, you dogs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

1066
01:24:39,235 --> 01:24:41,203
Let go!

1067
01:24:47,009 --> 01:24:49,273
They're clubhauling!

1068
01:24:49,345 --> 01:24:51,609
Hard to port!
Rack the starboard oars.

1069
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,910
Hard to port!

1070
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:07,658
Keep us steady, man.

1071
01:25:13,102 --> 01:25:14,160
Now!

1072
01:25:14,236 --> 01:25:15,260
Fire!

1073
01:25:15,337 --> 01:25:17,498
Fire all!

1074
01:25:26,048 --> 01:25:28,983
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

1075
01:26:14,497 --> 01:26:17,057
We could use
a few more ideas, lass.

1076
01:26:17,132 --> 01:26:18,190
Your turn.

1077
01:26:18,267 --> 01:26:20,531
We need us a devil's dowry.

1078
01:26:20,603 --> 01:26:22,833
We'll give them her.

1079
01:26:22,905 --> 01:26:25,135
She's not what they're after.

1080
01:26:27,009 --> 01:26:28,340
The medallion.

1081
01:26:49,598 --> 01:26:53,034
Raise your colors,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

1082
01:26:53,102 --> 01:26:55,832
Hands, grapnels, at the ready.

1083
01:26:55,905 --> 01:26:58,237
Prepare to board!

1084
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:34,407
Blast all to carcasses, men!

1085
01:27:34,476 --> 01:27:36,671
Forward clear
to the powder magazine.

1086
01:27:36,745 --> 01:27:41,876
And the rest of you,
bring me that medallion!

1087
01:27:49,892 --> 01:27:51,189
Help!

1088
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,251
Hey!

1089
01:28:10,145 --> 01:28:11,806
Below!

1090
01:28:31,233 --> 01:28:33,064
Thanks very much.

1091
01:28:45,748 --> 01:28:47,215
Jack!

1092
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:49,846
Bloody empty.

1093
01:28:53,722 --> 01:28:55,053
Aaah!

1094
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:07,797
That's not very nice.

1095
01:29:12,307 --> 01:29:13,501
Where's the medallion?

1096
01:29:13,575 --> 01:29:15,372
Wretch!

1097
01:29:16,311 --> 01:29:17,710
Ahh.

1098
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:19,748
Where's dear William?

1099
01:29:21,016 --> 01:29:22,483
Will!

1100
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:25,411
Will!

1101
01:29:25,487 --> 01:29:26,920
Elizabeth!

1102
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,922
Monkey!

1103
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,531
I can't move it!

1104
01:29:39,601 --> 01:29:40,568
Come on!

1105
01:29:40,636 --> 01:29:41,864
Will!

1106
01:29:41,937 --> 01:29:43,063
Elizabeth!

1107
01:29:55,384 --> 01:29:57,443
Why, thank you, Jack.

1108
01:29:57,519 --> 01:29:59,146
You're welcome.

1109
01:29:59,221 --> 01:30:02,918
Not you.
We named the monkey "Jack."

1110
01:30:02,991 --> 01:30:07,394
Gents, our hope is restored!

1111
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:45,964
Any of you so much as thinks
the word "parley,"

1112
01:30:46,034 --> 01:30:49,492
I'll have your guts for garters.

1113
01:30:56,478 --> 01:30:58,070
Will!

1114
01:30:58,147 --> 01:31:00,741
You've got to stop it!

1115
01:31:00,816 --> 01:31:03,011
-Stop it!
-Welcome back, miss.

1116
01:31:03,085 --> 01:31:05,815
You took advantage
of our hospitality last time.

1117
01:31:05,888 --> 01:31:09,551
It holds fair now
you return the favor.

1118
01:31:14,997 --> 01:31:16,225
Barbossa!

1119
01:31:18,267 --> 01:31:20,064
Will.

1120
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:24,165
She goes free.

1121
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,571
What's in your head, boy?

1122
01:31:27,242 --> 01:31:28,504
She goes free!

1123
01:31:28,577 --> 01:31:32,343
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

1124
01:31:32,414 --> 01:31:34,314
Don't do anything stupid.

1125
01:31:37,386 --> 01:31:39,013
You can't.

1126
01:31:39,087 --> 01:31:40,746
I can.

1127
01:31:41,757 --> 01:31:43,349
Like that.

1128
01:31:44,359 --> 01:31:46,224
Who are you?

1129
01:31:46,295 --> 01:31:47,819
No one.
He's no one.

1130
01:31:47,896 --> 01:31:51,354
A distant cousin of
my aunt's nephew twice removed.

1131
01:31:51,433 --> 01:31:53,526
Lovely singing voice, though.
Eunuch.

1132
01:31:53,602 --> 01:31:55,229
My name is Will Turner.

1133
01:31:55,304 --> 01:31:58,034
My father was
Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1134
01:31:58,106 --> 01:32:00,700
His blood runs in my veins.

1135
01:32:00,776 --> 01:32:03,540
He's the spitting image
of old Bootstrap Bill

1136
01:32:03,612 --> 01:32:04,943
come back to haunt us.

1137
01:32:05,013 --> 01:32:08,915
On my word, do as I say,
or I'll pull this trigger

1138
01:32:08,984 --> 01:32:12,181
and be lost
to Davy Jones' locker.

1139
01:32:12,254 --> 01:32:14,552
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.

1140
01:32:14,623 --> 01:32:15,749
Elizabeth goes free.

1141
01:32:15,824 --> 01:32:18,520
Yes, we know that one.
Anything else?

1142
01:32:21,363 --> 01:32:24,890
And the crew.
The crew are not to be harmed.

1143
01:32:29,404 --> 01:32:31,031
Agreed.

1144
01:32:37,312 --> 01:32:38,802
Go on, poppet, go!

1145
01:32:38,881 --> 01:32:40,439
Walk the plank!

1146
01:32:50,425 --> 01:32:54,122
Barbossa, you lying bastard!
You swore she'd go free!

1147
01:32:54,196 --> 01:32:56,960
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.

1148
01:32:57,032 --> 01:32:58,590
I agreed she'd go free,

1149
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:02,535
but it was you who failed
to specify when or where.

1150
01:33:07,943 --> 01:33:11,640
Though does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it?

1151
01:33:11,713 --> 01:33:13,237
Aye.

1152
01:33:13,315 --> 01:33:16,682
So I'll be having that dress
back before you go.

1153
01:33:20,889 --> 01:33:22,083
I always liked you.

1154
01:33:26,228 --> 01:33:27,991
Goes with your black heart.

1155
01:33:29,498 --> 01:33:31,932
Ooh, it's still warm.

1156
01:33:34,536 --> 01:33:36,094
Off you go!

1157
01:33:36,705 --> 01:33:38,536
Come on!

1158
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:43,234
Too long!

1159
01:33:54,022 --> 01:33:56,991
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1160
01:33:57,926 --> 01:34:01,293
Jack...

1161
01:34:02,364 --> 01:34:03,831
Did you not notice?

1162
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:08,862
That be the same island
we made you governor of
on our last little trip.

1163
01:34:09,871 --> 01:34:11,133
I did notice.

1164
01:34:11,206 --> 01:34:12,639
Perhaps you'll be
able to conjure up

1165
01:34:12,708 --> 01:34:15,336
another miraculous escape.

1166
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:17,139
But I doubt it.

1167
01:34:19,881 --> 01:34:21,439
Off you go.

1168
01:34:21,516 --> 01:34:22,380
Yeah.

1169
01:34:22,451 --> 01:34:25,045
Last time, you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1170
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,145
By the powers, you're right.

1171
01:34:27,222 --> 01:34:30,714
Where be Jack's pistol?
Bring it forward.

1172
01:34:33,862 --> 01:34:37,263
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman would give us

1173
01:34:37,332 --> 01:34:38,594
a pair of pistols.

1174
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:40,362
it'll be one pistol as before,

1175
01:34:40,435 --> 01:34:42,869
You can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady

1176
01:34:42,938 --> 01:34:45,873
and starve to death yourself.

1177
01:35:09,228 --> 01:35:10,320
That's the second time

1178
01:35:10,396 --> 01:35:13,854
I've had to watch that man
sail away with my ship.

1179
01:35:15,601 --> 01:35:18,195
But you were marooned
on this island before.

1180
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:19,862
We can escape
the same way you did.

1181
01:35:19,938 --> 01:35:22,805
To what point and purpose,
young missy?

1182
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:24,775
The Black Pearl is gone.

1183
01:35:24,843 --> 01:35:28,404
Unless you have a rudder and
sails hidden in that bodice.

1184
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:30,675
Unlikely.

1185
01:35:30,749 --> 01:35:34,276
Young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1186
01:35:36,588 --> 01:35:38,579
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

1187
01:35:38,657 --> 01:35:42,559
You vanished from seven agents
of the East india Company.

1188
01:35:42,628 --> 01:35:45,654
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot.

1189
01:35:45,731 --> 01:35:48,791
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

1190
01:35:50,669 --> 01:35:52,637
How did you escape last time?

1191
01:35:59,344 --> 01:36:03,781
Last time, I was here a grand
total of three days, all right?

1192
01:36:04,983 --> 01:36:06,507
Last time...

1193
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:10,989
The rumrunners
used this island as a cache,

1194
01:36:11,056 --> 01:36:14,025
came by, and I was able to
barter passage off.

1195
01:36:14,093 --> 01:36:15,424
From the looks of things,

1196
01:36:15,494 --> 01:36:17,826
they've long been out
of business.

1197
01:36:17,896 --> 01:36:22,390
Probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1198
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:25,765
So that's it, then?

1199
01:36:25,838 --> 01:36:27,897
That's the secret
grand adventure

1200
01:36:27,973 --> 01:36:30,498
of the infamous Jack Sparrow?

1201
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:35,570
You spent three days lying
on a beach, drinking rum?

1202
01:36:37,749 --> 01:36:40,115
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1203
01:36:49,061 --> 01:36:50,653
We're devils,
we're black sheep

1204
01:36:50,729 --> 01:36:52,253
We're really bad eggs

1205
01:36:52,331 --> 01:36:54,595
Drink up,
me hearties, yo ho

1206
01:36:54,666 --> 01:36:56,531
Yo ho, yo ho

1207
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:57,534
Ouch!

1208
01:36:57,603 --> 01:36:58,968
A pirate's life for me

1209
01:36:59,037 --> 01:37:01,028
I love this song!

1210
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:07,068
Really bad eggs!

1211
01:37:07,146 --> 01:37:08,135
Ooh.

1212
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:12,948
When I get the Pearl back,

1213
01:37:13,018 --> 01:37:15,680
I'm gonna teach it
to the whole crew.

1214
01:37:15,754 --> 01:37:17,312
We'll sing it all the time.

1215
01:37:17,389 --> 01:37:21,257
You'll be the most fearsome
pirate in the Spanish Main.

1216
01:37:21,326 --> 01:37:24,124
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1217
01:37:24,196 --> 01:37:25,754
The entire ocean.

1218
01:37:25,831 --> 01:37:28,493
The entire world.

1219
01:37:28,567 --> 01:37:32,162
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is, you know.

1220
01:37:32,237 --> 01:37:35,070
It's not just a keel
and a deck and sails.

1221
01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:36,630
That's what a ship needs.

1222
01:37:36,708 --> 01:37:44,410
But what a ship is,
what the Black Pearl really is,

1223
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:46,246
is freedom.

1224
01:37:48,587 --> 01:37:52,717
Jack, it must be
really terrible for you

1225
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:55,259
to be trapped on this island.

1226
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:56,658
Oh, yes.

1227
01:37:56,728 --> 01:38:01,097
But the company is infinitely
better than last time,

1228
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:02,394
I think.

1229
01:38:04,102 --> 01:38:06,332
The scenery
has definitely improved.

1230
01:38:06,405 --> 01:38:07,895
-Mr. Sparrow.
-Mm-hmm?

1231
01:38:07,973 --> 01:38:10,498
I'm not entirely sure
I've had enough rum

1232
01:38:10,576 --> 01:38:12,737
to allow that kind of talk.

1233
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,273
I know exactly
what you mean, love.

1234
01:38:22,955 --> 01:38:24,513
To freedom.

1235
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:29,218
To the Black Pearl,

1236
01:38:58,523 --> 01:39:00,889
No! Not good!

1237
01:39:00,959 --> 01:39:03,553
Stop! Not good!

1238
01:39:03,629 --> 01:39:04,755
What are you doing?

1239
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:07,424
You burned all the food,
the shade! The rum!

1240
01:39:07,499 --> 01:39:09,160
Yes, the rum is gone.

1241
01:39:09,234 --> 01:39:10,963
Why is the rum gone?

1242
01:39:11,036 --> 01:39:12,799
One, because it is a vile drink

1243
01:39:12,871 --> 01:39:15,704
that turns even the most
respectable men into scoundrels.

1244
01:39:15,774 --> 01:39:18,868
Two, that signal is over
a thousand feet high.

1245
01:39:18,944 --> 01:39:21,174
The entire Royal Navy
is looking for me.

1246
01:39:21,246 --> 01:39:24,875
Do you think there is the
slightest chance they won't see?

1247
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:26,781
But why is the rum gone?

1248
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:29,778
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1249
01:39:29,855 --> 01:39:32,619
You give it one hour, maybe two,
and you will see

1250
01:39:32,691 --> 01:39:35,091
white sails on that horizon.

1251
01:39:41,933 --> 01:39:45,835
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

1252
01:39:45,904 --> 01:39:48,304
Well, it bloody is now!

1253
01:39:55,213 --> 01:39:57,807
There'll be no living
with her after this.

1254
01:39:58,517 --> 01:40:00,485
-But we've got to save Will.
-No.

1255
01:40:00,552 --> 01:40:02,313
You're safe now.

1256
01:40:02,387 --> 01:40:04,082
We will return to Port Royal,

1257
01:40:04,156 --> 01:40:06,124
not go gallivanting
after pirates!

1258
01:40:06,191 --> 01:40:08,159
Then we condemn him to death.

1259
01:40:09,361 --> 01:40:12,159
The boy's fate is regrettable,

1260
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:14,755
but so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1261
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:18,530
To rescue me. To prevent
anything from happening to me.

1262
01:40:18,603 --> 01:40:22,095
If I may be so bold as to inject
my professional opinion.

1263
01:40:22,174 --> 01:40:25,166
The Pearl was listing near
to scuppers after the battle.

1264
01:40:25,243 --> 01:40:28,178
It's very unlikely she'll
be able to make good time.

1265
01:40:28,246 --> 01:40:30,077
Think about it.

1266
01:40:30,148 --> 01:40:32,082
The Black Pearl,

1267
01:40:32,150 --> 01:40:36,416
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1268
01:40:36,488 --> 01:40:38,956
How can you pass that up, right?

1269
01:40:40,592 --> 01:40:43,390
By remembering that I serve
others, Mr. Sparrow.

1270
01:40:43,462 --> 01:40:44,793
Not only myself.

1271
01:40:44,863 --> 01:40:47,093
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this.

1272
01:40:47,165 --> 01:40:48,598
For me.

1273
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,965
As a wedding gift.

1274
01:40:51,036 --> 01:40:53,163
Elizabeth.

1275
01:40:53,238 --> 01:40:56,503
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1276
01:40:58,543 --> 01:40:59,737
I am.

1277
01:40:59,811 --> 01:41:01,642
A wedding!
I love weddings!

1278
01:41:01,713 --> 01:41:03,613
Drinks all around!

1279
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:06,977
I know.

1280
01:41:07,052 --> 01:41:09,384
"Clap him in irons," right?

1281
01:41:11,223 --> 01:41:15,421
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1282
01:41:15,494 --> 01:41:18,657
and provide us with a bearing
to isla de Muerta.

1283
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:20,322
You will spend the rest
of the voyage

1284
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:22,833
contemplating all meanings
of the phrase

1285
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:25,096
"silent as the grave."

1286
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:26,728
Do I make myself clear?

1287
01:41:26,805 --> 01:41:29,399
Inescapably clear.

1288
01:41:32,911 --> 01:41:36,108
Shiver me timbers.

1289
01:41:36,181 --> 01:41:38,240
Cotton here says
you missed a bit.

1290
01:41:42,621 --> 01:41:44,646
You knew William Turner?

1291
01:41:45,724 --> 01:41:48,215
Ol' Bootstrap Bill.

1292
01:41:48,293 --> 01:41:50,090
We knew him.

1293
01:41:50,162 --> 01:41:54,121
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow.

1294
01:41:54,199 --> 01:41:56,724
The mutiny and all.

1295
01:41:56,802 --> 01:41:59,635
He said it wasn't right
with the Code.

1296
01:41:59,704 --> 01:42:03,663
That's why he sent off a piece
of the treasure to you.

1297
01:42:04,476 --> 01:42:08,139
He said we deserved
to be cursed.

1298
01:42:08,213 --> 01:42:10,272
And remain cursed.

1299
01:42:10,348 --> 01:42:11,372
Stupid blighter.

1300
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:13,281
Good man.

1301
01:42:13,852 --> 01:42:15,945
Well, as you can imagine,

1302
01:42:16,021 --> 01:42:18,854
that didn't sit too well
with the captain.

1303
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:22,155
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all.

1304
01:42:22,227 --> 01:42:26,357
-Tell him what Barbossa did.
-I'm telling the story!

1305
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:32,068
So, what the captain did.

1306
01:42:32,137 --> 01:42:36,430
He strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1307
01:42:36,508 --> 01:42:39,568
And last we saw
of Ol' Bill Turner,

1308
01:42:39,644 --> 01:42:45,014
he was sinking to
the crushing, black oblivion
of Davy Jones' locker.

1309
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:47,646
'Course it was only after that

1310
01:42:47,719 --> 01:42:50,654
we learned we needed his blood
to lift the curse.

1311
01:42:50,722 --> 01:42:53,122
That's what you call ironic.

1312
01:42:58,029 --> 01:42:59,326
Bring him.

1313
01:43:05,936 --> 01:43:08,063
I don't care for the situation.

1314
01:43:08,138 --> 01:43:11,699
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn to an ambush.

1315
01:43:11,775 --> 01:43:15,108
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1316
01:43:15,179 --> 01:43:19,309
I convince Barbossa to send his
men out with their little boats.

1317
01:43:19,383 --> 01:43:21,613
You and your mates return
to the Dauntless

1318
01:43:21,685 --> 01:43:25,052
and blast the bejesus out of
them with your little cannons.

1319
01:43:25,122 --> 01:43:27,352
What do you have to lose?

1320
01:43:27,424 --> 01:43:30,689
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1321
01:43:31,528 --> 01:43:34,156
Now, to be quite honest
with you,

1322
01:43:34,231 --> 01:43:36,165
there's a risk to those
aboard the Dauntless,

1323
01:43:36,233 --> 01:43:39,725
which includes
the future Mrs. Commodore.

1324
01:43:39,803 --> 01:43:41,964
Sorry, but it's
for your own safety.

1325
01:43:42,039 --> 01:43:44,405
The commodore ordered!
I have to tell him!

1326
01:43:44,475 --> 01:43:45,703
The pirates!

1327
01:43:45,776 --> 01:43:47,676
They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

1328
01:43:47,745 --> 01:43:49,906
Don't worry.
He's informed of that.

1329
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:54,144
A mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story.

1330
01:43:54,218 --> 01:43:56,948
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1331
01:44:07,631 --> 01:44:08,996
No reason to fret.

1332
01:44:09,066 --> 01:44:12,035
Just a prick of the finger.
A few drops of blood.

1333
01:44:12,102 --> 01:44:13,729
No mistakes this time.

1334
01:44:13,804 --> 01:44:17,797
He's only half Turner.
We spill it all!

1335
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:21,475
Guess there is reason to fret.

1336
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:37,418
Beg your pardon.
Beg your pardon.

1337
01:44:37,494 --> 01:44:39,325
-Begun by blood.
-Excuse me.

1338
01:44:39,396 --> 01:44:42,160
By blood --

1339
01:44:44,802 --> 01:44:46,235
Jack!

1340
01:44:46,503 --> 01:44:47,629
It's not possible.

1341
01:44:47,705 --> 01:44:49,832
Not probable.

1342
01:44:50,441 --> 01:44:52,909
Where's Elizabeth?

1343
01:44:52,977 --> 01:44:55,468
She's safe,
just like I promised.

1344
01:44:55,546 --> 01:44:58,310
She's set to marry Norrington,
like she promised.

1345
01:44:58,382 --> 01:45:00,714
You get to die for her,
like you promised.

1346
01:45:00,784 --> 01:45:03,446
So we're all
men of our word, really.

1347
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,318
Except for Elizabeth who is,
in fact, a woman.

1348
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:08,824
Shut up!
You're next.

1349
01:45:10,828 --> 01:45:14,025
You don't want to
be doing that, mate.

1350
01:45:14,098 --> 01:45:16,828
No, I really think I do.

1351
01:45:17,835 --> 01:45:19,860
Your funeral.

1352
01:45:23,073 --> 01:45:25,541
Why don't I want to be doing it?

1353
01:45:25,609 --> 01:45:27,440
Well, because...

1354
01:45:27,511 --> 01:45:32,608
Because the HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1355
01:45:32,683 --> 01:45:37,848
is floating just offshore,
waiting for you.

1356
01:45:45,863 --> 01:45:47,262
What we doing here?

1357
01:45:48,799 --> 01:45:52,826
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1358
01:45:52,903 --> 01:45:58,500
We catch them in a crossfire,
send them down to see Old Hob.

1359
01:45:58,575 --> 01:46:00,270
I know why we're here.

1360
01:46:00,344 --> 01:46:02,005
I meant, why aren't we doing

1361
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:05,947
what Mr. Sparrow said we should
do with the cannons and all?

1362
01:46:06,016 --> 01:46:09,645
Because it was
Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1363
01:46:12,289 --> 01:46:14,814
You think he wasn't
telling the truth?

1364
01:46:14,892 --> 01:46:17,087
Just hear me out, mate.

1365
01:46:17,161 --> 01:46:19,322
You order your men
to row to the Dauntless,

1366
01:46:19,396 --> 01:46:21,523
They do what they do best.

1367
01:46:21,598 --> 01:46:23,589
Robert's your uncle.
Fannie's your aunt.

1368
01:46:23,667 --> 01:46:26,363
There you are with two ships.

1369
01:46:26,437 --> 01:46:28,632
The makings of
your very own fleet.

1370
01:46:28,705 --> 01:46:32,300
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship, and who's to argue?

1371
01:46:32,376 --> 01:46:34,344
But what of the Pearl?

1372
01:46:35,479 --> 01:46:37,242
Name me captain.

1373
01:46:37,314 --> 01:46:40,249
I'll sail under your colors.
I'll give you 10% of me plunder.

1374
01:46:40,317 --> 01:46:46,085
And you get to introduce
yourself as Commodore Barbossa.

1375
01:46:46,156 --> 01:46:47,088
Savvy?

1376
01:46:47,157 --> 01:46:50,786
I suppose in exchange, you
want me not to kill the whelp.

1377
01:46:50,861 --> 01:46:53,955
No, no, no. Not at all.
By all means, kill the whelp.

1378
01:46:54,031 --> 01:46:56,329
Just not yet.

1379
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:02,066
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1380
01:47:04,241 --> 01:47:06,801
For instance...

1381
01:47:08,112 --> 01:47:11,548
After you've killed
Norrington's men.

1382
01:47:11,615 --> 01:47:16,484
Every last one.

1383
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:28,655
You've been planning this
from the beginning.

1384
01:47:28,732 --> 01:47:30,723
Ever since you learned my name.

1385
01:47:30,801 --> 01:47:31,893
Yeah.

1386
01:47:34,204 --> 01:47:35,967
I want 50% of your plunder.

1387
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:37,472
-15%.
-40%.

1388
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:39,566
25%.

1389
01:47:39,643 --> 01:47:40,974
I'll buy you the hat.

1390
01:47:41,044 --> 01:47:44,980
A really big one, Commodore.

1391
01:47:47,818 --> 01:47:50,685
We have an accord.

1392
01:47:50,754 --> 01:47:53,314
All hands to the boats!

1393
01:47:54,291 --> 01:47:55,417
Apologies.

1394
01:47:55,492 --> 01:47:57,187
You give the orders.

1395
01:47:58,362 --> 01:48:02,526
Gents, take a walk.

1396
01:48:07,104 --> 01:48:09,004
Not to the boats?

1397
01:49:07,197 --> 01:49:09,188
Hold fire.

1398
01:49:12,236 --> 01:49:16,434
Oh, this is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy.

1399
01:49:16,506 --> 01:49:20,340
Except they was in a horse
instead of dresses.

1400
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:21,809
Wooden horse.

1401
01:49:34,658 --> 01:49:36,319
A moment, please.

1402
01:49:39,896 --> 01:49:41,295
Elizabeth?

1403
01:49:44,134 --> 01:49:46,898
I just want you to know

1404
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:49,962
I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1405
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,167
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1406
01:49:53,176 --> 01:49:55,371
But, you know,
even a good decision,

1407
01:49:55,445 --> 01:49:59,404
if made for the wrong reasons,
can be a wrong decision.

1408
01:50:05,922 --> 01:50:07,583
Look into that.
Report back.

1409
01:50:07,658 --> 01:50:08,886
Lieutenant?

1410
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,067
Yoo-hoo!

1411
01:50:27,878 --> 01:50:29,277
Elizabeth?

1412
01:50:31,114 --> 01:50:32,604
Are you there?

1413
01:50:34,685 --> 01:50:37,313
Elizabeth, are you
even listening to me?

1414
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:06,515
Oh, what have you done?

1415
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,278
-Oooh!
-Stop that!

1416
01:51:08,352 --> 01:51:10,980
Already feel like a fool.

1417
01:51:11,054 --> 01:51:12,783
Look nice, though.

1418
01:51:16,927 --> 01:51:19,157
I look nice?

1419
01:51:55,298 --> 01:51:58,665
I must admit, Jack,
I thought I had you figured.

1420
01:51:58,735 --> 01:52:01,795
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1421
01:52:01,872 --> 01:52:03,806
Me?
I'm dishonest.

1422
01:52:03,874 --> 01:52:07,105
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1423
01:52:07,177 --> 01:52:08,371
Honestly.

1424
01:52:08,445 --> 01:52:10,913
It's the honest ones
you want to watch for,

1425
01:52:10,981 --> 01:52:13,279
because you can never predict

1426
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:17,514
when they're going to do
something incredibly stupid.

1427
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:44,877
Aaah!

1428
01:52:50,654 --> 01:52:53,020
You're off the edge
of the map, mate.

1429
01:52:53,089 --> 01:52:56,058
Here there be monsters.

1430
01:52:59,963 --> 01:53:00,163
Right!

1431
01:53:00,163 --> 01:53:02,825
Right!

1432
01:53:02,899 --> 01:53:04,867
What would you pick
to eat first?

1433
01:53:04,935 --> 01:53:06,994
I think we should decide now.

1434
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:10,039
Just so we're ready
when the time comes.

1435
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:36,159
What was that?

1436
01:53:54,384 --> 01:53:55,476
Shh!

1437
01:53:58,488 --> 01:54:00,183
Miss Elizabeth!

1438
01:54:19,576 --> 01:54:22,477
Make for the ship!
Move!

1439
01:54:31,187 --> 01:54:32,984
To the ship!

1440
01:54:35,792 --> 01:54:37,760
Row, men!

1441
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:18,029
You can't beat me, Jack.

1442
01:55:41,391 --> 01:55:43,621
That's interesting.

1443
01:55:53,737 --> 01:55:55,705
I couldn't resist, mate.

1444
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,717
Aaah!

1445
01:57:02,105 --> 01:57:03,265
Sorry!

1446
01:57:12,348 --> 01:57:13,872
So what now, Jack Sparrow?

1447
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:16,714
Are we to be two immortals
locked in an epic battle

1448
01:57:16,786 --> 01:57:20,244
until judgment day
and trumpets sound?

1449
01:57:20,323 --> 01:57:22,415
Or you could surrender.

1450
01:57:30,567 --> 01:57:33,468
Aaaah!

1451
01:57:48,818 --> 01:57:50,183
All of you with me!

1452
01:57:50,253 --> 01:57:52,312
Will is in that cave.
We must save him.

1453
01:57:52,388 --> 01:57:55,619
Ready.
And heave!

1454
01:58:01,131 --> 01:58:03,656
Please, I need your help!
Come on!

1455
01:58:03,733 --> 01:58:06,224
Any port in a storm.

1456
01:58:06,302 --> 01:58:08,827
Cotton's right.
We've got the Pearl,

1457
01:58:08,905 --> 01:58:10,964
What about Jack?
Are you gonna leave him?

1458
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,871
Jack owes us a ship.

1459
01:58:12,942 --> 01:58:14,967
There's the Code to consider.

1460
01:58:15,044 --> 01:58:16,375
The Code?

1461
01:58:17,914 --> 01:58:19,347
You're pirates.

1462
01:58:19,415 --> 01:58:22,111
Hang the Code,
and hang the rules!

1463
01:58:22,185 --> 01:58:25,348
They're more like
guidelines anyway.

1464
01:58:27,957 --> 01:58:30,551
Bloody pirates!

1465
01:58:40,036 --> 01:58:41,970
-Hey.
-What?

1466
01:58:42,038 --> 01:58:44,006
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1467
01:58:44,073 --> 01:58:46,906
They're stealing our ship!

1468
01:58:46,976 --> 01:58:49,308
Bloody pirates!

1469
01:58:50,647 --> 01:58:53,207
Boarders, away!

1470
01:59:00,757 --> 01:59:02,987
Come on!

1471
01:59:03,059 --> 01:59:04,458
Gaaah!

1472
01:59:28,651 --> 01:59:29,811
Me eye!

1473
01:59:40,196 --> 01:59:42,096
-Aaaah!
-Aaaah!

1474
01:59:49,873 --> 01:59:52,000
I'm gonna teach you
the meaning of pain!

1475
01:59:52,075 --> 01:59:53,633
Do you like pain?

1476
01:59:55,345 --> 01:59:57,575
Try wearing a corset.

1477
02:00:07,223 --> 02:00:09,521
Whose side is Jack on?

1478
02:00:09,592 --> 02:00:11,059
At the moment?

1479
02:00:25,475 --> 02:00:27,443
Aaaaaah!

1480
02:00:46,896 --> 02:00:48,022
No fair.

1481
02:01:11,721 --> 02:01:17,216
Ten years you carry that pistol,
and now you waste your shot.

1482
02:01:17,293 --> 02:01:19,124
He didn't waste it.

1483
02:01:44,954 --> 02:01:46,751
I feel...

1484
02:01:50,994 --> 02:01:52,461
Cold.

1485
02:02:54,557 --> 02:02:56,081
Parley?

1486
02:02:57,126 --> 02:02:59,060
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1487
02:02:59,128 --> 02:03:00,459
Huzzah!

1488
02:03:00,530 --> 02:03:01,462
Huzzah!

1489
02:03:47,276 --> 02:03:49,608
We should return
to the Dauntless,

1490
02:03:52,115 --> 02:03:55,209
Your fianc will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1491
02:04:05,461 --> 02:04:08,453
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1492
02:04:09,565 --> 02:04:11,055
That was it.

1493
02:04:12,635 --> 02:04:13,761
If you'd be so kind,

1494
02:04:13,836 --> 02:04:17,067
I'd be much obliged if you'd
drop me off at my ship.

1495
02:04:22,111 --> 02:04:24,375
I'm sorry, Jack.

1496
02:04:26,315 --> 02:04:31,116
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1497
02:04:45,935 --> 02:04:48,995
"Jack Sparrow,
be it known that you..."

1498
02:04:49,071 --> 02:04:51,505
Captain.
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1499
02:04:51,574 --> 02:04:56,170
"For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown."

1500
02:04:56,479 --> 02:04:59,107
"Said crimes being numerous
in quantity

1501
02:04:59,182 --> 02:05:01,548
and sinister in nature.

1502
02:05:01,617 --> 02:05:05,348
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith.

1503
02:05:05,421 --> 02:05:07,912
Piracy, smuggling..."

1504
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:10,288
This is wrong.

1505
02:05:10,359 --> 02:05:13,123
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law.

1506
02:05:13,196 --> 02:05:15,721
As are we all.

1507
02:05:15,798 --> 02:05:18,460
"Impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy.

1508
02:05:18,534 --> 02:05:21,628
impersonating a cleric
of the church of England."

1509
02:05:21,704 --> 02:05:22,864
Ah, yeah.

1510
02:05:22,939 --> 02:05:26,636
"Sailing under false colors,
arson, kidnapping,

1511
02:05:26,709 --> 02:05:33,740
looting, poaching, brigandage,
pilfering, depravity,

1512
02:05:33,816 --> 02:05:37,718
depredation,
and general lawlessness.

1513
02:05:37,787 --> 02:05:40,119
And for these crimes

1514
02:05:40,189 --> 02:05:42,749
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

1515
02:05:42,825 --> 02:05:46,522
hung by the neck until dead.

1516
02:05:46,596 --> 02:05:48,962
May God have mercy
on your soul."

1517
02:05:49,031 --> 02:05:51,397
Governor Swann.

1518
02:05:51,467 --> 02:05:53,196
Commodore.

1519
02:05:54,103 --> 02:05:55,695
Elizabeth.

1520
02:05:56,472 --> 02:05:59,964
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you.

1521
02:06:02,411 --> 02:06:03,571
I love you.

1522
02:06:20,529 --> 02:06:21,587
Marines.

1523
02:06:21,664 --> 02:06:23,393
I can't breathe.

1524
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:26,261
Elizabeth!

1525
02:06:28,571 --> 02:06:29,629
Move!

1526
02:06:41,450 --> 02:06:42,712
What...

1527
02:06:54,030 --> 02:06:55,622
Move!

1528
02:07:14,617 --> 02:07:16,050
Come on!

1529
02:07:16,118 --> 02:07:18,245
-Right!
-Come on, lads!

1530
02:07:43,346 --> 02:07:48,215
I thought we might endure some
ill-conceived escape attempt.

1531
02:07:48,284 --> 02:07:49,751
But not from you.

1532
02:07:49,819 --> 02:07:53,619
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1533
02:07:53,689 --> 02:07:55,350
And this is how you thank me?

1534
02:07:55,424 --> 02:07:58,120
By throwing in
your lot with him?

1535
02:07:58,194 --> 02:07:59,126
He's a pirate!

1536
02:07:59,195 --> 02:08:01,186
And a good man.

1537
02:08:02,498 --> 02:08:04,398
If all I have achieved
is the hangman

1538
02:08:04,467 --> 02:08:08,130
will earn two pairs of boots
instead of one, so be it.

1539
02:08:08,204 --> 02:08:09,967
My conscience will be clear.

1540
02:08:10,039 --> 02:08:13,805
You forget your place, Turner.

1541
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:18,441
It's right here
between you and Jack.

1542
02:08:22,485 --> 02:08:23,474
As is mine.

1543
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:24,883
Elizabeth!

1544
02:08:26,255 --> 02:08:28,519
Lower your weapons.

1545
02:08:28,591 --> 02:08:31,025
For goodness sake,
put them down!

1546
02:08:35,431 --> 02:08:39,026
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then?

1547
02:08:39,902 --> 02:08:41,460
It is.

1548
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:53,745
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1549
02:08:53,816 --> 02:08:56,341
I think we've all arrived
at a special place.

1550
02:08:56,419 --> 02:08:57,477
Spiritually.

1551
02:08:57,553 --> 02:08:59,646
Ecumenically.

1552
02:08:59,722 --> 02:09:01,747
Grammatically.

1553
02:09:02,425 --> 02:09:06,088
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

1554
02:09:06,162 --> 02:09:07,527
Know that.

1555
02:09:11,467 --> 02:09:12,764
Elizabeth.

1556
02:09:14,737 --> 02:09:18,036
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1557
02:09:19,375 --> 02:09:20,672
I'm sorry.

1558
02:09:22,978 --> 02:09:23,774
Will.

1559
02:09:26,282 --> 02:09:27,715
Nice hat.

1560
02:09:29,185 --> 02:09:31,278
Friends.

1561
02:09:33,422 --> 02:09:36,516
This is a day that you will
always remember

1562
02:09:36,592 --> 02:09:37,957
as the day that...

1563
02:09:43,432 --> 02:09:47,027
Idiot. He has nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1564
02:09:48,204 --> 02:09:50,536
Sail ho!

1565
02:09:58,113 --> 02:10:00,741
What's your plan of action?

1566
02:10:01,383 --> 02:10:02,680
Sir?

1567
02:10:06,956 --> 02:10:09,220
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1568
02:10:09,291 --> 02:10:13,318
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1569
02:10:13,395 --> 02:10:17,422
piracy itself
can be the right course?

1570
02:10:21,470 --> 02:10:23,404
Mr. Turner.

1571
02:10:28,777 --> 02:10:31,575
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1572
02:10:37,486 --> 02:10:39,613
This is a beautiful sword.

1573
02:10:41,757 --> 02:10:45,249
I would expect the man who
made it to show the same care

1574
02:10:45,327 --> 02:10:48,262
in every aspect of his life.

1575
02:10:50,266 --> 02:10:52,029
Thank you.

1576
02:10:54,670 --> 02:10:56,604
Commodore!

1577
02:10:56,672 --> 02:10:58,435
What about Sparrow?

1578
02:10:59,608 --> 02:11:03,305
Well, I think we can afford to
give him one day's head start.

1579
02:11:09,051 --> 02:11:09,881
So.

1580
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:14,915
This is the path
you've chosen, is it?

1581
02:11:16,258 --> 02:11:21,161
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1582
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:22,595
No.

1583
02:11:27,336 --> 02:11:29,395
He's a pirate.

1584
02:11:54,296 --> 02:11:56,025
Heave!

1585
02:12:05,874 --> 02:12:08,809
Thought you were supposed to
keep to the Code.

1586
02:12:08,877 --> 02:12:13,007
We figured they were
more actual guidelines.

1587
02:12:17,119 --> 02:12:18,882
Thank you.

1588
02:12:19,888 --> 02:12:21,788
Captain Sparrow.

1589
02:12:25,594 --> 02:12:27,789
The Black Pearl is yours.

1590
02:12:42,978 --> 02:12:44,707
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

1591
02:12:44,780 --> 02:12:46,509
Hands to braces!

1592
02:12:46,582 --> 02:12:49,050
Let down and haul to run free!

1593
02:12:50,419 --> 02:12:54,719
Now, bring me that horizon.

1594
02:13:01,263 --> 02:13:04,130
And really bad eggs.

1595
02:13:07,002 --> 02:13:09,232
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho!
