00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:25,632
When he didn't come to the office,
10:30, 11:00 o'clock...

3
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:29,223
I called the house.

4
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:30,722
<i>Catharine...

5
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:34,556
he went in his sleep,
so peacefully.

6
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,059
<i>The doctor said if you'd been
sleeping right next to him...

7
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:40,857
you wouldn't even have known.

8
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:44,150
You couldn't have done anything.

9
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,494
Mrs. Petersen.

10
00:02:57,753 --> 00:03:01,039
- Catharine, let me come up with you.
- No.

11
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,788
You get some rest, Sara.

12
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,886
Nice blouse, Alex.
- Has been for years, Michael.

13
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:25,220
Talk to me, I'm two hours late, I spent
the whole morning going over obituaries.

14
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,932
The whole morning?

15
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,970
Yeah, Detroit Free Press on your list?
April 12th.

16
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:33,347
Jesus! I don't roll out of bed, brush my teeth,
and read obituaries before coffee.

17
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:36,891
Wasn't this guy a capo for Marangano
a few years back?

18
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,395
- So?
- So!

19
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:42,352
Two guys die within four days
of each other, what does that say to you?

20
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:46,575
No pattern, this guy could've been a hit,
but Marangano <i>died in his sleep, remember?

21
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:49,068
<i>He just stopped breathing.</i>
They ran a full toxicology...

22
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:51,071
- Not now.
-<i> Is that what Bruce thinks?

23
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,278
Alex.

24
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:56,620
A government pouch to someone's
home is illegal. Worse, it's expensive.

25
00:05:56,794 --> 00:06:00,412
Well, my contribution
to the Federal deficit.

26
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:08,128
And let go of this Marangano thing,
people die in their sleep, Alex, even dons.

27
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:10,261
<i>- It was a hit!
- Hey, keep it down there.

28
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,756
Marangano ran trash collection
for half of Jersey.

29
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,603
- You don't die in your sleep of something called...
-<i> Ondine's Curse.

30
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,270
"Damage of unknown origin to the part
of the brain that controls breathing."

31
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,782
It's rare. It's real. It happened.

32
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:26,437
Yeah, I've been here six years, it never
happened. You do a run on it?

33
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:32,655
- This the only one?
-<i> Yeah, and it can't be connected.

34
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:36,990
This guy's not Mafia, he's some
millionaire publisher from New York.

35
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,492
"Cause of death unknown."

36
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,096
"Evidence suggests unexplained
interruption of breathing."

37
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:44,166
"Consider possibility of Ondine's Curse."

38
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:49,082
"Sam Petersen, age 60. Survived
by his wife of four months, Catharine..."

39
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:53,588
"age 31."
- And I had to go back a year to get that.

40
00:06:55,014 --> 00:07:00,257
<i>Alex, it's the only</i> one, believe me,
believe me, there's nothing there.

41
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:19,442
I've got it sitting right here
in front of me.

42
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,282
Walter, you see, I don't know how
to read the god damn instructions.

43
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:27,708
I'm only 5 fuckin' years old.

44
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:32,373
Now, you be my daddy,
and you tell me how to use it.

45
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:35,170
Nice and simple.

46
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,181
<i>Oh, you god damn right I'm serious.
Look, Walter, my bride is here for our luncheon.

47
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:44,266
<i>Well, I've never been
anybody's daddy neither.

48
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:49,262
<i>But if you want me to pop for 200,000
units of this little plastic</i> turd here...

49
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,347
- I suggest that you start faking it.
-<i> Well, all right

50
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:56,605
<i>- How's that wife of yours?
- She don't look so good today.</i>

51
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,279
<i>- She's the best-looking gal in Dallas.
- She looks kind of scrag.</i>

52
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,856
<i>Scraggly, my ass.</i>

53
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,824
Yeah, well, listen, you write some of
these instructions in English,

54
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:08,050
<i>maybe you can find a market
for this What's-It-Called.

55
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,163
<i>I'm right on top of it.

56
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,417
Yeah, okay, yeah, uh-huh, so long then.

57
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:18,381
Marielle, you think anybody's gonna
be interested in a thing like this?

58
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:23,840
It's about winning, Ben.
Everybody's interested in winning.

59
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,682
Yeah, they forgot that they're
making this toy for kids.

60
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:29,802
The instructions are too complicated.

61
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:30,852
Really.

62
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:35,432
Hot damn!

63
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:59,098
I gotta be the world's
number one airhead.

64
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:03,478
Be gone five days, and I'm packing
half of Neiman Marcus here.

65
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,310
Marielle?

66
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,310
Yeah, Hon?

67
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,198
How come we ran out of brandy
so quick, Hon?

68
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,613
Didn't I see a fresh bottle
in the cabinet?

69
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,998
Right again, Hon.

70
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:54,434
<i>Marielle, I've explained to Etta
that this will is valid in all respects.

71
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:58,987
<i>Any contest here would just be
a waste of time and money.

72
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:02,735
My time... my money.

73
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:08,908
<i>What, a man cuts</i> his only sister out of
his will two months after marrying a...?

74
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,659
<i>Younger woman?

75
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:16,043
You know something, Etta,
your husband is right.

76
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,585
Ben had no quarrel with you.

77
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:22,007
<i>Only the way you felt about me.

78
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,965
I think, if he were here...

79
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,723
he'd regret what he'd done.

80
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,431
Martin?

81
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:38,476
What would be the tax consequences
if I were to make a small gift?

82
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,892
Young lady...

83
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:45,735
Marielle is going to go back
to Charleston...

84
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:51,364
and she doesn't want any
harsh feelings <i>or needless delays.

85
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:55,746
How small a gift, Dear?

86
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:05,165
Something in the mid-six figures?

87
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:20,180
Miss Barnes! Miss Barnes?

88
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:23,356
Miss Barnes, can I look
in your purse, please?

89
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,527
<i>Here she comes!

90
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,494
So, what? You gonna knock over
a liquor store or somethin'?

91
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:45,244
I was just at the target range,
I'm trying to get certified, that's all.

92
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:49,960
I'll tell you what,
send the piece back to Sears.

93
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,178
<i>Remember that Ondine's Curse thing?

94
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,938
Another one came up today.

95
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:07,192
This guy died 10 days ago.

96
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,530
Dinner?

97
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:24,115
What?

98
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:28,868
- I said, dinner? Eat? Tonight?
- I... I...I have work left.

99
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:32,128
Fine... tomorrow?

100
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:35,463
Michael, I don't think it's a good idea,
we work together.

101
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,717
What, office policy? What?

102
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,550
Okay, I resign.

103
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:46,474
It's just that I can't afford to lose you,
you're my right arm.

104
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:49,640
Okay.

105
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:58,273
What did you say about Ondine's Curse?
You got somethin' new?

106
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:00,771
- It's not Mafia.
- What is it?

107
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,364
It's a toy manufacturer from Dallas.

108
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:08,261
He was very rich, he was very clean.
I'll get you a printout tomorrow, okay?

109
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,896
All right.

110
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,535
- Night.
- G'night.

111
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,798
Michael.

112
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,133
Wait up.

113
00:14:24,303 --> 00:14:26,711
I'm gonna go with you.

114
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,966
Could a Texas toy mogul
have a mob connection?

115
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:36,062
Actually, the Texan's a ringer
for that other guy from New York.

116
00:14:36,231 --> 00:14:39,018
How's that?
- Well, both older guys, very rich...

117
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:42,228
each married to a young gal
for a couple of months.

118
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:46,447
- Must be kinda bad for your health.
- Hey, you got a minute?

119
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,788
Make some calls to New York, Dallas.
Newspapers, whatever.

120
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:02,119
Let's round up some photos.

121
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:05,914
Shouldn't be hard,
they were prominent guys.

122
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:10,800
Not the men,
the wives.

123
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,818
Okay.

124
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:38,158
Seattle guidebooks,
Japanese cooking, what next?

125
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,664
- Rare coins.
-<i> What sort of rare coins?

126
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:47,621
Something general for the beginner, then
something more particular. Perhaps...

127
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:49,505
Italy, the 19th century.

128
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:52,710
Before the city-states
were unified or after?

129
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,590
I don't know,
<i>which'd be more...

130
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,177
unusual?

131
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:04,051
Northwest Indians. Which tribes?

132
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,598
Coast Salish, for certain,
whatever else you have.

133
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:10,561
Tlingit, Bella Coola, Kwakiutl.

134
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:12,940
<i>My primary interest is in totem poles.

135
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:15,733
What are you,
cramming for a game show?

136
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:23,937
No, I'll take it, thank you.

137
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:52,330
Come here, come here, c'mon.
Teachers! Please! Let's move 'em along.

138
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:54,341
<i>Please, this way.

139
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,682
One million dollars.

140
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,720
A very generous offer, Miss Dodd, but...

141
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,984
this museum does not sell
places on its board.

142
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,481
- Our chairman...
- Yes.

143
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:18,786
I'm sure Mr. McCorey will appreciate
my intentions. Good day.

144
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,995
But Margaret,
we want your views on this.

145
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,244
Now, I understand you had very
strong feelings about this collection.

146
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,825
Mr. McCorey, I...

147
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,039
I didn't want my first meeting
<i>to be one where I...

148
00:19:35,214 --> 00:19:37,108
You disagreed with anybody.

149
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:42,803
I think it's a mistake for us
to concentrate so exclusively...

150
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:45,463
on the Coast Salish in our acquisitions.

151
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:50,346
You want to be the best at something,
but that's not our role.

152
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,014
And what is, Margaret?

153
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:55,189
We need to compare all the tribes.

154
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:58,443
We study their art to learn about them.

155
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,839
We study them to...

156
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,943
understand ourselves.

157
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:10,532
- These are the best pictures you have?
- She doesn't want pictures.

158
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:13,493
She knows the camera's there,
she turns away, I can tell.

159
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,205
The Texas one is different,
she's got a slimmer body.

160
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:19,002
- No, it's the way she's standing...
- She's younger, at least five years younger.

161
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,715
- That's makeup, hair, attitude.
- I think you're wrong.

162
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:23,425
I could be right.

163
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,128
<i>Look, the whole M.O., a complex series
of </i>seductions and murders...

164
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:29,630
that's not something
you see a woman do.

165
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:34,634
Oh, really? Which part you figure a woman isn't
up to? The seduction or the murder?

166
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:37,432
<i>Look, I just want</i> the field assignment.

167
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:40,013
- Please?
- Listen...

168
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:42,896
data analysis is the heart
of what we do here,

169
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:46,438
and the best work in this shop
is yours. The best.

170
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:50,113
- It's a job you were born to do.
-<i> It's a job with green windows!

171
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:53,071
Bruce, I've been in this office
for six years.

172
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:56,365
This god damned government
office with green windows.

173
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,967
Yeah, I know, you want excitement.

174
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:00,620
Well, a lot of people don't look
to get it all from their job.

175
00:21:01,836 --> 00:21:03,235
What's that supposed to mean?

176
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:04,716
Jesus, Alex, what the hell
do you think it means?

177
00:21:04,803 --> 00:21:06,757
Havin' a god damned date for one thing!

178
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:11,503
When was the last time you rolled in late
on a Monday because of a big weekend?

179
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,012
I really can't believe
you're saying this to me!

180
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,886
<i>I have to listen to this shit
from my mother!

181
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,226
Who the hell do you think
you are, Bruce?

182
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,940
Look, I just...

183
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,394
You're not happy.

184
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:36,736
You're not a happy person.

185
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:41,445
And you deserve to be, that's all.

186
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:45,872
Bruce, make me happy.

187
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:58,470
Even if you're right, it isn't federal.

188
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:04,597
So, whatever you can't fit in on the
weekends, make sure you call in sick, okay?

189
00:22:07,397 --> 00:22:09,225
Thanks.

190
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:21,780
She was destroyed by his death,
they were very devoted.

191
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,996
Catharine needed to get away,
and she went to Europe.

192
00:22:26,164 --> 00:22:29,532
That was over a year ago,
have you heard from her?

193
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:34,205
I had a postcard from Rome, I had
a lovely note from Vienna, a little gift.

194
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,876
All in the first month, or thereabouts.
Anything lately?

195
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,128
Only the attorney.

196
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:44,718
He received instructions
to convert the entire estate into cash...

197
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:47,801
<i>and to transfer the funds
to a numbered Swiss account.

198
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:51,808
<i>No one else in Manhattan,</i>
not a single soul.

199
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,183
Everyone says the same thing,
"She's from Chicago", "She had no family"

200
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:58,773
They don't know where she lived,
where she worked.

201
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:01,778
Could I have this photograph?

202
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:10,776
I'm sorry,
that must've sounded awful.

203
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:18,623
Sara, it's just that she came out of thin
air, and she vanished BACK into thin air.

204
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:23,443
- Well, is that against the law?
- It's odd, I find it odd.

205
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:29,382
<i>Sam Petersen is gone,</i>
so is all of his property, his money.

206
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:34,591
And if I loved him as much as you did,
I'd find it very odd indeed.

207
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:45,142
That's Felice Baciocchi
and her sister Elisa.

208
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:51,029
You probably looked all this up
just to impress me.

209
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:55,234
Did it work?

210
00:23:55,746 --> 00:24:02,199
Well, you know, I really did wonder,
you SEEM almost too good to be true.

211
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:06,004
I thought of checking up on you.

212
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:13,300
Not a bad thought.

213
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:17,172
After all, I could be
practically anybody.

214
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:20,678
Dangerous not to check people out.

215
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:23,012
I did.

216
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:28,270
And what did you find?

217
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:35,075
I found that you went to Mount
Holyoke, you studied anthropology...

218
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:38,526
and I found...

219
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:41,699
we're a lot alike.

220
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:48,502
We like Italy, and we like coins.

221
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,248
And we like to live alone.

222
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:57,337
You never talk about that.

223
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:01,639
I don't know why I never married.

224
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:04,512
I have a serviceable list of reasons.

225
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:10,271
Take out my reasons
and polish them every once in a while.

226
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,894
I kept on growing out
in all these...

227
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:18,232
peculiar and idiosyncratic directions.

228
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:22,904
I'd put on a little bristle here
and a bristle there...

229
00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:25,200
and sort of...

230
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:27,577
turned myself into a porcupine.

231
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:36,170
- What?
- Well, it's just such an old joke.

232
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:38,711
How do two porcupines...

233
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:41,255
make love?

234
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,136
Very carefully.

235
00:25:53,438 --> 00:25:57,222
Um-huh, to the left, right around this corner,
you'll find it.

236
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:10,695
It's very kind of you to make time
in your busy schedule for me, Etta.

237
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,829
No trouble at all, Honey.

238
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:16,659
So have you thought at all
about what I said?

239
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:19,788
Uh-huh. You know somethin'?

240
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:23,497
That very same idea occurred to me
right after the funeral.

241
00:26:23,674 --> 00:26:25,631
<i>As a matter of fact,
I even hired a detective.

242
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:30,095
<i>Sent him over to Charleston,
where she SAID her people were at.

243
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:33,965
There was nothing at all.
No family, not even a trace.

244
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:38,138
Why didn't you come forward, Etta?

245
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:41,605
Ben was gone,
I couldn't bring him back.

246
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:45,190
<i>I thought, "Well, it'll be in the papers."
I didn't want to have a big scandal.

247
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:47,983
Okay, about the will, Etta.

248
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:51,440
Rice Institute was the only
other beneficiary, wasn't it?

249
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:54,368
Yes, Ben was gracious and...

250
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:57,288
And I bet you wondered
if Marielle got caught...

251
00:26:57,456 --> 00:27:00,741
Rice might just take back
that little gift she gave you.

252
00:27:08,758 --> 00:27:11,759
You're looking a little peaked, Dear.

253
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:14,632
Can I buy you a tan?

254
00:27:55,801 --> 00:28:01,221
<i>I've been coming here about this time
of year since</i> I was 5 years old.

255
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:06,641
And every year, when we'd leave...

256
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:09,848
I'd feel this sense of...

257
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,858
loss, I suppose.

258
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:24,777
Always promised myself
I'd live here... someday.

259
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,619
Why don't you?

260
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,830
Why don't we?

261
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,362
What is this thing,
you almost broke my tooth?

262
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:14,368
Medic alert,
I'm allergic to penicillin.

263
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,256
- We're done, we're done.
- We're all done.

264
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:35,425
Last hand, you guys.

265
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:38,519
Herb's got it, Honey,
he's got that look.

266
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:43,020
- That's the look?
-<i> That's the look.

267
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:45,065
Yeah, I'm done.

268
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:48,521
You do got it,
you lame son of a bitch.

269
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:56,276
I'll see your 20
and kick you 20.

270
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:59,123
What is that, suicide?
Some kind of sympathy ploy?

271
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,403
It's called putting up your money,
what you say, Herbert?

272
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,622
I got it, Alex, keep your 40.

273
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:06,550
Kick me back.

274
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:11,748
It's a call... all blue, Darlin'.

275
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:14,921
Remember last week?

276
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:18,928
- I think we're even now, Baby.
- Yeah, well, look, I gotta get outta here.

277
00:30:21,144 --> 00:30:23,053
Hold on a second, hold on
a second, will you, please?

278
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:25,269
- Guys, come on.
- Take it easy!

279
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,811
Excuse me, Stu, this is my money, Guys.
I've got about...

280
00:30:27,983 --> 00:30:30,984
<i>I got about 40, 50,
60 dollars here.

281
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:33,229
<i>Say, this is my money, Guys,
I already got it spent.

282
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:35,896
<i>Yeah, what are you buying,
new underwear?

283
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,908
- You took Alex out once, didn't you?
- Yeah, Redskins game.

284
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,831
So how'd it go?

285
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:46,708
Skins lost.

286
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:51,879
Hi.

287
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:54,537
You want your neck rubbed?

288
00:30:54,716 --> 00:30:57,004
No.

289
00:30:59,262 --> 00:31:02,298
I want my neck rubbed.

290
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,468
- Oh, man.
- Thinking about your Borgia lady?

291
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:10,104
Uh-huh.

292
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:14,560
- You figure out how she hits them?
- Oh, Christ, I don't know.

293
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:18,898
It could be methadone,
it leaves a negligible trace.

294
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:22,198
You know how many men over 50...

295
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:25,783
married women under 40
in the last four months?

296
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:27,905
Nope.

297
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,037
Neither do I.

298
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:34,457
Now try the top 30 cities.

299
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:37,584
You tell me.

300
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:44,886
<i>Exactly a zillion.

301
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,968
And that's the easy part.

302
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:51,759
Now try crossing that
against millionaires.

303
00:31:51,936 --> 00:31:54,224
Get photos of the women.

304
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,600
And you could use more computer time.

305
00:31:57,774 --> 00:31:59,648
No, I'm there.

306
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,817
I'm down to six ladies.

307
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,229
That includes the two
I got this week.

308
00:32:05,407 --> 00:32:07,813
Alex, you can't be travelin'
all over the damned country...

309
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:10,743
No, I gotta check 'em out.

310
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:13,200
I gotta check 'em out.

311
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,539
What, are you scared<i> for me?

312
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:22,375
<i>You're full of shit,</i> Bruce.

313
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,128
Call you from Denver.

314
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,835
Maybe Seattle.

315
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,339
See ya.

316
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:35,347
<i>Pull your cars
as far forward as possible.</i>

317
00:32:35,517 --> 00:32:37,593
<i>Stop your engine.</i>

318
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:40,933
<i>Set your emergency brake.</i>

319
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:57,251
Everything's fine,
you can get dressed.

320
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:02,925
Oh, Doctor, I almost forgot,
I have this recurring tonsillitis and...

321
00:34:03,098 --> 00:34:05,423
well, with this Seattle weather...

322
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,925
What usually works for you?

323
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:09,976
Penicillin.

324
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:14,188
I think she said her degree
was in anthropology.

325
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:16,600
Vassar<i> or Smith or...

326
00:34:16,777 --> 00:34:20,193
- And she was originally from...?
- New England, I think.

327
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:21,650
Maybe... maybe it wasn't, I don't...

328
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,780
It's funny, I see it three
mornings a week and I still...

329
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,697
Sally, is Mrs. McCorey across
the hall this morning?

330
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,488
Please check, no, I have a reporter in here
who'd like some background on her.

331
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,072
No, I'd rather not bother her today,
if you don't mind.

332
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:37,456
<i>I don't... I don't like to</i> impose on my
subjects till I have something written up...

333
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,121
you know, in case they want
to make changes, like...

334
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:42,126
Margaret isn't in this morning,
Irene, can I help?

335
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:45,053
William, this is Mrs. Talley.

336
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:47,177
- It's very nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

337
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:49,663
She's with the Post-Intelligencer,
doing a background

338
00:34:49,773 --> 00:34:53,599
piece <i>on our some of our more
prominent women volunteers.

339
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:57,554
I know your managing editor fairly well,
You're on metro desk, features?

340
00:34:57,732 --> 00:35:01,729
I'm not with the paper, actually,
I'm... I'm... I'm freelance.

341
00:35:01,902 --> 00:35:04,809
I was hoping that the women's
section would pick up an article.

342
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,336
I'm doing some work in the storeroom,
why don't we talk there?

343
00:35:07,386 --> 00:35:08,874
Fine.

344
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,243
Please don't touch anything down here.

345
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:18,080
- Your home phone?
- Well, I don't live here in town.

346
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:23,206
- So you're staying at the...?
- The Hilton.

347
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,290
- Look...
-<i> Airport?

348
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:26,841
Downtown.

349
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,717
Just one question.

350
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,715
Why did you lie back there
about the paper?

351
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:39,950
I'm sorry, I really am, I...

352
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:41,972
See, I'm just starting out,

353
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:45,563
and I thought that an article on powerful
women might sell to Cosmo...

354
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,812
- or Woman's Day, and so...
- Oh, yeah, I see, I see.

355
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:53,608
I never had to prove myself like that.

356
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:56,825
It must be hard for you.

357
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:03,415
My wife's a very private person,
and I respect that.

358
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:09,128
But let me talk to her, and we'll see
if we can't help you out.

359
00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:12,633
That's very understanding of you.

360
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:27,268
Anything else?

361
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:36,779
I think that's it, thanks.

362
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:45,571
Hey! Hey, Leo, will you fix that screen?

363
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:48,417
Okay, I'll fix it!

364
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,161
- All right!
- Come on, man!

365
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:52,328
- I'll fix it!
- Another movie on survival?

366
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,146
<i>Just because you can't
see a suspect...</i>

367
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:57,006
<i>doesn't mean he can't see you.</i>

368
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:01,132
There's a resemblance, there is, but I've seen
strangers who look like twins.

369
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,429
You are just LOOKING for
a reason to kiss this off

370
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:05,301
'cause you don't have the stomach for it.

371
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:07,598
<i>Yeah, what are you looking for?

372
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:11,018
Why do you wanna bury this lady?
Two old guys die of some curse?

373
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:14,770
Ondine's Curse, they died in their sleep,
they stopped breathing.

374
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,479
When McCorey dies
of the same thing, you call me.

375
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,978
You said the wives were out
of town when these guys died.

376
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,324
She poisoned them.
She put it in some...

377
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,981
I don't know!
Something that she thought they'd drink or eat.

378
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:28,112
These boys were autopsied.

379
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,731
You got any cops in New York or Dallas

380
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,454
wanna dig up the bodies and run another one?

381
00:37:31,623 --> 00:37:33,496
No, you don't, but you want me to go to one

382
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:35,289
of the five richest men in this state...

383
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,248
and tell him <i>some dingbat Fed
thinks his wife's a murderer...

384
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,289
when nobody else even thinks
there's been a homicide.

385
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,041
You're right, you're absolutely right,

386
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:44,218
you solved the whole case
from behind your desk.

387
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:46,068
Why don't you just take
the rest of the day off?

388
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,466
No! You're absolutely right.
Hello, Mrs. McCorey?

389
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:53,631
We were wondering if you'd come down to the
station and tell us if you ever killed anybody?

390
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:56,226
No, ma'am, we don't have any evidence.

391
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:59,931
I just spent the whole morning
showing you the god damned evidence!

392
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,151
If that's what the Justice Department
calls evidence these days,

393
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,653
then that is the scariest part
of this whole conversation.

394
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:12,900
The thing is, I know I'm right.

395
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:33,799
So, what do you think?

396
00:38:33,973 --> 00:38:35,966
I think the player's better than the piano.

397
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:38,133
Oh, right.

398
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:41,259
I'll get a tuner out here tomorrow.

399
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:48,190
<i>Oh, a young woman stopped
by the museum.

400
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:51,527
<i>She's researching an article about you.

401
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:55,647
<i>I liked her,
she seemed really very sweet.

402
00:38:57,244 --> 00:38:58,703
Fix you a drink?

403
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,452
<i>Ma'am.

404
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:10,497
Check again.

405
00:39:10,673 --> 00:39:14,421
Look, she told my husband
she was here waiting for a call.

406
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:16,546
She was here.

407
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:21,547
Checked out this afternoon,
transferring to the Inn at the Market.

408
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:24,429
Perhaps I could call for you.

409
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,380
Shit!

410
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,752
<i>Margaret?

411
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:35,420
<i>- Yeah, I'm up here!</i>
- Oh, I'll come up.

412
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:38,631
<i>No, no, no,
I'll be down in just a minute.

413
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:45,220
I thought you were fishing.
No luck?

414
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:49,183
<i>I was gonna call the lawyer
about the board meeting.

415
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:52,278
I think it's a mistake, Sweetheart.

416
00:41:53,657 --> 00:41:55,199
Shit.

417
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,407
It's a family business.

418
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:07,705
You put me on another board,
there'll just be conflict and resentment.

419
00:42:08,337 --> 00:42:11,089
You're my wife,
I want you with me.

420
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:17,917
I do like the way you say that.

421
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,178
- Where'd they find him?
- Look, Agatha Christie,

422
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:25,579
he didn't die of any
weird breathing disease,

423
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:26,865
just a good old-fashioned
regular heart attack.

424
00:42:26,915 --> 00:42:28,115
Boom! Like everybody else.

425
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:29,715
Did they do an autopsy?

426
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:32,480
Yes, they did an autopsy,
and a regular toxicology screen, too.

427
00:42:32,692 --> 00:42:36,476
Great, that covers about 60
compounds at the outside.

428
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:41,189
And you would think she wouldn't
know what to avoid?

429
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:46,115
Anaphylactic shock looks
just like cardiac arrest.

430
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:48,281
Was he allergic to something?

431
00:42:48,457 --> 00:42:51,660
- Bee venom? Antibiotics?
- Bee venom!

432
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,623
Bee venom.
<i>You're not gonna believe this...

433
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,586
but I thoroughly overlooked that possibility.
Boy, that's gonna be my ass.

434
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,058
She's left town,
and you don't know where she's gone.

435
00:43:01,136 --> 00:43:03,089
Lady, there's been no homicide,
no investigation,

436
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:05,586
no suspect, why should
I care where she went?

437
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:08,677
Enough to know she's left.
You're scared shitless, Richie.

438
00:43:08,893 --> 00:43:10,791
<i>They're gonna find out about
me and they're</i> gonna wonder

439
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:13,186
why you didn't check it out
when you had the chance.

440
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:18,208
Lady, if you got a complaint, go file it,
otherwise, please, go fuck yourself.

441
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,585
It's not a reason.

442
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:42,123
I was in the room with him,
he was four feet away from me.

443
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,791
- And what were you supposed to do?
-<i> I don't know.

444
00:43:47,386 --> 00:43:49,462
I... I just...

445
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:52,091
should have...

446
00:43:52,308 --> 00:43:54,881
<i>- said it, I should have told him.</i>
- And he'd have believed you?

447
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:58,102
He would have had a chance,
<i>I didn't give him a chance!

448
00:43:58,271 --> 00:44:02,649
Hey, he would've gone straight to her with it,
and then you're blown and then she's gone.

449
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:05,308
<i>And maybe he's alive.

450
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:12,441
Alex, you don't quit your job...

451
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:14,326
six years...

452
00:44:14,495 --> 00:44:17,828
to go chasing after some phantom!

453
00:44:22,211 --> 00:44:24,286
She's not a phantom.

454
00:44:30,593 --> 00:44:32,965
Come on, come on!

455
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:37,633
We got her, I think we got her,
I think we finally got her.

456
00:44:57,868 --> 00:45:01,201
- Hi.
- Hi.

457
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:04,741
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

458
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:08,328
This is from me.

459
00:45:08,503 --> 00:45:10,625
I already have my ticket to Hawaii.

460
00:45:10,796 --> 00:45:12,872
It's a ticket back.

461
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,255
What makes you so sure
she's even there?

462
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:22,931
Michael says the lady at the ticket
counter in Seattle recognized her photo.

463
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:26,682
Who's to say she didn't fly right back
out of Hawaii under any name at all?

464
00:45:26,853 --> 00:45:28,929
Maybe she did.

465
00:45:30,231 --> 00:45:32,687
Where else am I gonna start?

466
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:40,654
- I heard you sold all your stuff.
- Yeah.

467
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:43,362
- What'd you get for the BMW?
- Well...

468
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:46,904
I got 5900 for it.
Blue Book said 66...

469
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,828
but the salesman was wearing
a bow tie and I was in a hurry.

470
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,368
Would you do me a favor?

471
00:45:56,464 --> 00:45:58,373
Would you get this back to Sears?

472
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,345
- Don't underestimate this woman.
- She's not about guns.

473
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:10,682
You want to catch her,
you gotta think like she thinks.

474
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,227
I think.

475
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:15,806
And you figure you know her, huh?
Why she does it?

476
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:17,773
<i>Tell me.

477
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:23,149
When I was a kid, my father...
I told you this story, though, didn't I?

478
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,403
My dad had quite a temper.

479
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,658
He used to<i> take off after me
with this</i> spatula, you know.

480
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:32,576
Stainless steel pancake turner.
Man, that thing stung like hell.

481
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,701
One of these times, I don't even remember
what I did, he chased me down the hall...

482
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:39,872
and he got me into my bedroom,
and he was beating the crap out of me.

483
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:41,291
Man.

484
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:45,281
And he stood up, keeled over and died.

485
00:46:46,927 --> 00:46:49,464
I figure this woman, Margaret,
or whatever her name is...

486
00:46:49,637 --> 00:46:53,635
has some deep resentment
against older men and...

487
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:55,928
Are you buying this?

488
00:46:56,102 --> 00:46:59,056
I can't believe you really went for it.

489
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:01,439
Goddamn it.

490
00:47:01,649 --> 00:47:04,685
Don't you know? No one knows
why anyone does anything.

491
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,008
All I know is that she's obsessed with
killing and you're obsessed with her.

492
00:47:09,197 --> 00:47:12,566
<i>What worries me is that
you might be as wacky as she is.

493
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:17,244
I'll be back with a tan.

494
00:47:30,885 --> 00:47:34,928
<i>Over here, all of you going
to Kilauea, line up here please.

495
00:48:32,274 --> 00:48:34,562
<i>Whoo.

496
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,742
We are standing at the newest
place on this planet.

497
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:39,375
It's like nowhere on Earth.

498
00:49:42,088 --> 00:49:44,579
I love this place!

499
00:49:48,636 --> 00:49:52,550
<i>Everybody comes to Hawaii
for the sand, for the beach...

500
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:56,886
<i>but to put a hotel here,
it would cost a fortune.

501
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,721
Do you know what?

502
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,899
My bankers say I'm insane.

503
00:50:07,529 --> 00:50:12,190
God, in the right spot,
it would be fantastic!

504
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:32,792
You always been impatient, Lady?
I mean, your whole life?

505
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:37,097
Mr. Shin, in four weeks
I've given you 600 dollars.

506
00:50:37,265 --> 00:50:39,933
You, by way of contrast,
have given me zip.

507
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:43,601
<i>I'm surprised you can find
your office in the morning.

508
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:48,231
You always sarcastic like that?
You were sarcastic little baby?

509
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,317
You look for lady for four weeks, huh?

510
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:54,273
One time I look for somebody
for 18 years.

511
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:57,316
Quite a recommendation.

512
00:50:57,991 --> 00:51:00,114
Persistence.

513
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:05,113
Besides, can't find such a pretty lady
for buck and a half a week.

514
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:06,746
Need incentive bonus.

515
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:08,624
No bonus, you just
show me what you've got.

516
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:11,160
Whaddya mean, what I got, huh?
I got nothing.

517
00:51:11,337 --> 00:51:14,504
<i>Mr. Shin, any man that</i> would ask me
for a price increase...

518
00:51:14,674 --> 00:51:18,043
without anything to deliver
would be kind of stupid.

519
00:51:18,219 --> 00:51:20,425
<i>Now, no point in insulting
your intelligence,

520
00:51:20,638 --> 00:51:23,638
I'd rather do business on a basis
of mutual respect.

521
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,014
That's good.

522
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,675
- I like respect.
-<i> Fine.

523
00:51:29,062 --> 00:51:30,521
Where is she?

524
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:33,525
All right, ladies,
before we re-enter the pool...

525
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:39,111
let's review the most important rule:
Never, never race your bubbles to the surface.

526
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:45,567
It can cause lung expansion, which
can result in air in the bloodstream.

527
00:51:45,744 --> 00:51:49,872
This can produce an embolism,
which can result in...

528
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,288
Are you sure you're all right?
Maybe you should...

529
00:51:52,338 --> 00:51:54,222
a very agonizing death.

530
00:51:55,628 --> 00:51:58,415
<i>Now then, ladies, let's get in the pool.

531
00:52:05,012 --> 00:52:07,218
Good. Okay, ladies,
come around here.

532
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,384
Come on. Come on, all of you.

533
00:52:10,558 --> 00:52:15,600
We're going to pair up and practice
breathing two on the same regulator.

534
00:52:15,772 --> 00:52:18,524
This would be necessary when
one partner runs out of air.

535
00:52:18,691 --> 00:52:20,980
Now pair up. You and you.
You and you.

536
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:26,858
<i>That's right. Take the regulator and give
it to your partner for emergency air.

537
00:52:27,032 --> 00:52:30,199
Partners?
Don't worry, I'm not really contagious.

538
00:52:30,369 --> 00:52:34,318
My friend promised me she'd
be my partner, so...

539
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:38,488
Well, that leaves me odd man out,
doesn't it?

540
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:42,585
- Rennie Walker.
- Jessica Bates.

541
00:52:42,755 --> 00:52:45,625
- Jessica Bates, I owe you a beer.
- Take you up on it.

542
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,800
<i>Now you take the regulator
in your right hand...

543
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:52,924
and you take two breaths from it,
and then you give it to your partner.

544
00:52:53,098 --> 00:52:56,881
She takes two breaths from it,
and then you take it back...

545
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,429
and... and YOU breathe into it twice.

546
00:53:01,022 --> 00:53:04,805
<i>On five, you blow out.
Don't hold her nose so tight.

547
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:08,150
<i>You have to close her nose,
but don't rip it off her face.

548
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,645
<i>And keep your hand on
the back of her neck.

549
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:14,274
<i>If her airway closes,
she will not be able to breathe.

550
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:16,776
You're not taking this personally,
are you?

551
00:53:16,953 --> 00:53:18,364
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

552
00:53:18,931 --> 00:53:20,888
<i>Okay, Girls, that's it
for this afternoon. </i>

553
00:53:20,944 --> 00:53:25,933
Thank you very much for your participation,
you can all go, thank you.

554
00:53:30,758 --> 00:53:32,881
What's your name again?

555
00:53:33,052 --> 00:53:35,191
- Rennie.
- Rennie.

556
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:40,428
- What are you doing here?
- Just hangin' out.

557
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:43,016
Spending my money.

558
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,143
What are you looking at?

559
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,530
Oh, I'm sorry, no... no, it's just that
we spent most of the day in the pool and...

560
00:53:56,698 --> 00:53:59,865
you come out looking like that
and I look like this, and

561
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:02,489
I just wondered why that is.

562
00:54:06,499 --> 00:54:08,824
You don't look bad.

563
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:10,495
New suit might help, though.

564
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:16,085
Oh, it's just the suit? Great.
I'm on a budget.

565
00:54:21,304 --> 00:54:23,012
What?

566
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:27,178
What do you say we go up to my room,
<i>have a couple of decent drinks?

567
00:54:27,352 --> 00:54:28,597
All right.

568
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:37,016
- You married or what?
-<i> Nope.

569
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:41,111
Not at the moment.

570
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:44,862
Thank you. Who's this?

571
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:46,742
You like that, do you?

572
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:50,114
Men that look like this,
you usually end up supporting.

573
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:56,161
His name's Paul Nuytten, and he owns
half a dozen hotels around the world.

574
00:54:56,337 --> 00:55:01,959
Does he have a brother? Cousin?
Young grandfather?

575
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,552
<i>He's having a party tonight,
do you want to come?

576
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,214
What?

577
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:10,674
<i>He's having a party tonight,
do you want to come?

578
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,716
Oh, I can't, I left all my designer
stuff back in Chicago.

579
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:18,429
<i>Well, that's all right,
you can borrow something of mine.

580
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,188
Could I borrow your hair?

581
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,234
How about your hairdresser?

582
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,072
Sure.

583
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:42,999
- You look pretty.
- Thanks.

584
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:44,831
- You gonna be okay?
- I think so.

585
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:46,998
I'll catch you later.

586
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:52,003
Gin and tonic.

587
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:01,805
Thank you.

588
00:56:40,516 --> 00:56:44,976
Oh, I know this dress,
but who is the woman?

589
00:56:45,395 --> 00:56:48,978
Paul Nuytten, my new pal,
Jessica Bates.

590
00:56:49,149 --> 00:56:50,857
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Welcome.

591
00:56:51,026 --> 00:56:53,149
Thank you,
you have a beautiful home.

592
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,193
Thank you.

593
00:56:56,864 --> 00:57:00,030
Would you like to dance?

594
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:04,947
No, thanks,
I have new shoes.

595
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:28,342
Mademoiselle.

596
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,683
Thank you, what's your name?

597
00:57:30,895 --> 00:57:34,930
- They call me Tran.
- Tran?

598
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:38,978
Rennie.

599
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:44,820
Tonight you stay?

600
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:49,656
You have a very busy day tomorrow.

601
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:52,119
You have to polish your boat...

602
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:55,246
hunt some wild boar.

603
00:57:58,796 --> 00:58:00,670
Oh, Paul.

604
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:05,466
You have your little phone book,
lots of numbers.

605
00:58:09,222 --> 00:58:12,140
Why do we keep having
this conversation?

606
00:58:12,767 --> 00:58:14,890
It's you.

607
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:17,552
It's you I want.

608
00:58:23,694 --> 00:58:27,359
All you want is the woman
you haven't slept with.

609
00:58:27,865 --> 00:58:30,901
That's not the same as wanting me.

610
00:58:41,627 --> 00:58:43,335
<i>Paul...

611
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,478
I need a kiss.

612
00:59:22,398 --> 00:59:23,871
<i>Fresh fish!

613
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,251
<i>Aku! Fresh aku! Aku!
Freshest fish!

614
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:37,460
<i>- Fish! Fish!</i>
- That one.

615
00:59:37,637 --> 00:59:39,511
<i>- Two pounds.
- Hey!

616
00:59:41,516 --> 00:59:44,089
I see you've caught your fish after all.

617
00:59:45,144 --> 00:59:48,782
Oh, can't place my face, huh?
Forgetting is useful skill.

618
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:51,896
- I could learn some of that some time.
- Take out your cigarettes.

619
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:54,736
Take out your cigarettes
and offer me one.

620
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:58,776
No, thank you.
This is federal government, you asshole.

621
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:02,255
You don't wanna lose your license.
Point. At the fish.

622
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:04,206
Now say thank you and goodbye.

623
01:00:04,362 --> 01:00:06,326
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

624
01:00:14,096 --> 01:00:15,290
Who was that guy back there?

625
01:00:15,464 --> 01:00:18,713
He's a local, and he's asking me
if the fish is fresh.

626
01:00:24,973 --> 01:00:26,681
- Hello?
-<i> Sara?

627
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:30,218
- Yes?
- Sara, it's Catharine.

628
01:00:30,395 --> 01:00:34,178
- Petersen.
- Catharine!

629
01:00:34,356 --> 01:00:37,725
It's been such a long time,
are you all right?

630
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:41,857
Well, I have a situation actually.

631
01:00:42,697 --> 01:00:46,529
Apparently, there's been a woman
reporter asking questions about me...

632
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:48,360
and Sam.

633
01:00:48,536 --> 01:00:51,074
Has anyone like that been
around to see you?

634
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:56,158
<i>Well, yes. There was a young woman
by here about six months ago.</i>

635
01:00:56,377 --> 01:00:58,832
But she said she was from
the federal government.

636
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:05,465
Listen, Sara, I really must go
right now, but...

637
01:01:05,635 --> 01:01:07,793
I'll phone you later to catch up.

638
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:11,055
It's been such a long time,
and I would like to<i> keep in touch.

639
01:01:11,224 --> 01:01:13,579
<i>I'll talk to you later, bye.

640
01:04:39,749 --> 01:04:42,785
I'll do it. I'll do it!

641
01:04:44,337 --> 01:04:48,381
The goddamn gauge said half full,
how come there was no air in it?

642
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:52,958
I was supposed to check these things.

643
01:04:58,558 --> 01:05:02,093
If I was a little further out there,
or had my back turned...

644
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:05,771
You scared the shit out of me.

645
01:05:07,608 --> 01:05:10,229
Thanks for not having your back turned.

646
01:05:40,346 --> 01:05:43,016
I'll be right down.

647
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,283
Hey!

648
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,442
You really like those things?

649
01:06:08,372 --> 01:06:10,946
My second husband was addicted.

650
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,788
Second husband?
How many have you had?

651
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:18,338
Lots. That's how I got rich.

652
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:21,593
Once wasn't enough to get rich?

653
01:06:22,051 --> 01:06:24,174
Rich is hard.

654
01:06:25,221 --> 01:06:28,555
You never really figure
you're quite there.

655
01:06:29,142 --> 01:06:30,885
That sounds pretty romantic.

656
01:06:33,688 --> 01:06:35,265
Well...

657
01:06:36,398 --> 01:06:39,551
I used to think of it as my job...

658
01:06:39,985 --> 01:06:42,440
making myself appealing.

659
01:06:43,864 --> 01:06:46,236
I was a professional.

660
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:11,129
And.. I loved every one of them...

661
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:16,343
deeply,

662
01:07:18,645 --> 01:07:20,723
honestly.

663
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:27,685
<i>It wouldn't have worked any other way.

664
01:07:35,661 --> 01:07:37,535
You like him.

665
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,539
Paul, you like him.

666
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,878
Go for it.

667
01:07:50,967 --> 01:07:53,006
<i>He wants you to.

668
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:00,424
He needs somebody now...

669
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:03,176
who knows how to commit.

670
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,224
<i>...and they're arguing over some woman
named Pelé, like the soccer player.

671
01:08:11,403 --> 01:08:14,569
And one of the guys is arguing that
she's gonna go on the warpath on Tuesday.

672
01:08:14,739 --> 01:08:16,514
But the other guy says,
"No, next Wednesday."

673
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:19,233
<i>I mean, these six guys got
into the</i> same argument...

674
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:23,897
- like they all know the same woman, right?
- No, no, Pelé is a goddess.

675
01:08:23,947 --> 01:08:28,201
Goddess of devastation,
<i>she lives in a volcano, Kilauea.

676
01:08:28,377 --> 01:08:31,293
And every so often she makes fire.

677
01:08:31,462 --> 01:08:32,921
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

678
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:35,247
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

679
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:38,544
Thank you.
You okay?

680
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:42,670
I don't feel too well actually,
I think I'll go back to the hotel.

681
01:08:46,518 --> 01:08:49,056
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

682
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:58,850
- I'll drive you home.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

683
01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:01,318
It's only a headache.

684
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:06,449
I'll call you tonight,
we'll do something tomorrow.

685
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:12,077
Look, you and Jessie
go on with your afternoon, okay?

686
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:15,927
<i>And have a nice time.

687
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:46,443
Tran, did he work
for your family in Indochina?

688
01:09:46,698 --> 01:09:47,943
Huh?

689
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:53,949
It's just that you and he seem so close.
Did he work for another family?

690
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,698
Your wife's?

691
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:01,703
It's just that I sense...

692
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:04,621
She was killed.

693
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,206
She was only 19.

694
01:10:07,385 --> 01:10:08,879
<i>I'm sorry.

695
01:10:11,179 --> 01:10:13,931
And I'm sorry I made you think of it.

696
01:10:14,933 --> 01:10:19,559
It's a rare gift to see things
that others cannot.

697
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:23,189
It drives some people away.

698
01:10:25,009 --> 01:10:29,603
I don't think people like you to know
things before they're ready to tell you.

699
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:33,315
So I should just learn
to keep my mouth shut.

700
01:10:39,356 --> 01:10:42,039
Won't you see some of the Island?

701
01:10:45,302 --> 01:10:47,294
Yes, I'd like that.

702
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,610
Why are you smiling?
- Because you have a look on your face.

703
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,938
- Look?
- Like you want to ask something...

704
01:11:17,115 --> 01:11:19,653
then you don't.
You ought to just ask it.

705
01:11:19,826 --> 01:11:23,775
No, I was just thinking,
why hasn't this woman married?

706
01:11:23,955 --> 01:11:26,908
Attractive, intelligent.

707
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:29,331
Very, very strong.

708
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:32,372
- She is.
- She?

709
01:11:32,546 --> 01:11:34,373
But I'm talking about you.

710
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:37,925
<i>So...

711
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:41,296
<i>what about you and men?

712
01:11:43,139 --> 01:11:44,550
Bad timing.

713
01:11:44,974 --> 01:11:47,809
Maybe a little bit of fear?

714
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:51,828
<i>Tell you something about that.

715
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:55,356
It's very, very provocative.

716
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,255
It's a strange place.

717
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:07,921
The sap from the trees,
it cools the lava.

718
01:13:11,312 --> 01:13:12,755
- Paul?
- Huh.

719
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:16,222
- About Rennie.
- I'm not with Rennie,

720
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:19,099
I'm with you.

721
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:25,970
- I can't compete with her.
- There is no necessity.

722
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:34,821
I have to know whatever this is
is something honest and just for me.

723
01:13:35,576 --> 01:13:37,284
Look at me.

724
01:13:38,537 --> 01:13:40,411
Look at me.

725
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:44,497
Decide.

726
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:10,304
Here?

727
01:14:10,692 --> 01:14:14,476
I mean, can we turn
out the lights or something?

728
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,851
No knock? Come into
a person's office, no knock?

729
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:51,348
I'm sorry.

730
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:56,267
I knock. I come to your office, I knock.
Where were you born, anyway?

731
01:14:56,443 --> 01:14:59,776
- Wisconsin. Should I come back later?
- No.

732
01:14:59,946 --> 01:15:03,528
Too late to come back later,
you already no knock.

733
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,608
What you want, Wisconsin?

734
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:09,486
Mr. Shin, my name is Rennie Walker.

735
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:15,410
This woman befriended me.

736
01:15:15,626 --> 01:15:18,711
<i>And now I think she's seeing my fiancé.

737
01:15:22,508 --> 01:15:24,086
I really must know.

738
01:15:24,685 --> 01:15:28,169
No, no, no, I no do this kind of work,
not respectable.

739
01:15:28,389 --> 01:15:32,302
Mr. Shin, I'll tell you
two things about me.

740
01:15:32,475 --> 01:15:34,966
I'm very rich,

741
01:15:36,813 --> 01:15:39,638
and I'm very wealthy.

742
01:17:11,733 --> 01:17:15,513
<i>I'm sorry about Jessie,
I thought it was what you wanted.

743
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:21,361
Do you understand, Rennie?

744
01:17:26,998 --> 01:17:29,204
Long drive back.

745
01:17:30,251 --> 01:17:32,327
Fix me a drink?

746
01:17:56,108 --> 01:17:59,192
<i>Rennie? Rennie?

747
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:04,362
<i>Come in, I want you to.

748
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:07,902
Why tonight, after all this time?

749
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:09,233
Huh?

750
01:18:10,746 --> 01:18:13,783
I think we've waited long enough.

751
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:28,182
Just a minute.

752
01:19:32,572 --> 01:19:36,189
- Morning.
- Good morning.

753
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:47,908
You left this in the Jeep
the other day.

754
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:51,786
So you drove all the way
over just to deliver a sweater?

755
01:19:51,965 --> 01:19:54,761
No, not exactly.

756
01:19:54,926 --> 01:19:59,220
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

757
01:20:03,334 --> 01:20:05,516
I have something to tell you.

758
01:20:06,144 --> 01:20:08,137
Is something wrong?

759
01:20:08,897 --> 01:20:12,251
Last night, Rennie and I,
we decided to marry.

760
01:20:19,865 --> 01:20:23,281
<i>I want you to be okay with this.

761
01:20:25,162 --> 01:20:27,451
I'll be okay.

762
01:20:54,366 --> 01:20:59,469
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm cutting the cake myself.

763
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:02,893
I'll be out there in a minute.

764
01:21:09,328 --> 01:21:10,787
A woman in love.

765
01:21:12,623 --> 01:21:17,284
- Do you really doubt it?
- I helped you get here, didn't I?

766
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:20,711
<i>When you put us together,
it made him want you all the more.

767
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,213
So I guess you could say my
wedding gift was the groom.

768
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:29,135
I meant it as an exchange of gifts.

769
01:21:30,181 --> 01:21:33,513
Something you could take
with you from your time with Paul.

770
01:21:33,683 --> 01:21:37,551
Well, in that case, I still owe you one.

771
01:21:40,607 --> 01:21:43,727
- That was a beautiful ceremony.
- Thank you.

772
01:21:43,902 --> 01:21:46,392
It was a lovely ceremony.

773
01:21:47,321 --> 01:21:48,945
Open it.

774
01:21:50,616 --> 01:21:53,617
Whatever this is, it means a lot to me.

775
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,214
Black widow...

776
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:16,050
she mates and she kills.

777
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:21,762
Your question is, does she love?

778
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:26,224
It's impossible to answer that...

779
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,850
unless you live in her world.

780
01:22:36,112 --> 01:22:38,486
Such an intriguing gift.

781
01:22:44,523 --> 01:22:47,124
Makes me wish I had
more to share with you.

782
01:22:49,337 --> 01:22:53,963
- Truth is, I'm sorry it's over.
- The truth is, it's not over yet.

783
01:22:58,645 --> 01:23:00,434
Till then?

784
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:06,302
With your permission, may I have
the pleasure to kiss the lovely bride?

785
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,202
<i>Come in.

786
01:23:37,423 --> 01:23:41,040
Hey, Wisconsin, you knock,
I no recognize you.

787
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:43,301
Do you have my pictures?

788
01:23:45,722 --> 01:23:50,680
Hey, I see you got married
a little while ago, congratulations.

789
01:23:52,687 --> 01:23:55,259
<i>Good stuff, huh?

790
01:24:05,175 --> 01:24:08,488
What else do you have
in your desk, Mr. Shin?

791
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:13,654
What do you mean by that? I got a lot
of stuff, I got paper clips, I got menthol.

792
01:24:13,831 --> 01:24:17,257
Condoms even, not it any your business.

793
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:19,369
<i>Why you ask?

794
01:24:19,419 --> 01:24:23,557
Because you have a choice, Mr. Shin.
You can die or you can die happy.

795
01:24:23,607 --> 01:24:26,588
- Why are you doing this?
- It's in the second drawer. Look!

796
01:24:26,759 --> 01:24:28,337
You have five seconds.

797
01:24:33,057 --> 01:24:34,884
- One...
- Please.

798
01:24:35,351 --> 01:24:37,427
- two...
-<i> Wait! Wait!

799
01:24:38,979 --> 01:24:40,806
<i>- Hold on.</i>
- three...

800
01:24:47,612 --> 01:24:48,941
<i>four.</i>

801
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,908
<i>Hyland, let me see the needle.

802
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:57,533
Get it to the lab.

803
01:24:57,747 --> 01:25:00,582
- Make sure they don't move anything.
- Okay.

804
01:25:06,046 --> 01:25:07,751
I want the whole room dusted.

805
01:25:07,922 --> 01:25:10,793
<i>John, anything here for the Herald?
Or just a nothing OD?</i>

806
01:25:10,967 --> 01:25:13,672
<i>If it starts to get exciting,
I'll find your number.

807
01:25:17,265 --> 01:25:19,222
Now who would you be?

808
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:48,954
I'm glad you came over, Paul,
<i>I need to talk to you.

809
01:25:49,528 --> 01:25:51,832
<i>Don't you think</i> Rennie
left the Island a bit abruptly?

810
01:25:52,005 --> 01:25:56,999
No, just her usual trip, she sees
her accountant on the Mainland...

811
01:25:57,176 --> 01:25:58,920
investments.

812
01:26:01,931 --> 01:26:04,967
Paul, how well do you
think you know me?

813
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:06,781
<i>Know you?

814
01:26:10,271 --> 01:26:13,042
- A little bit, I guess.
- Would I ever lie to you?

815
01:26:13,092 --> 01:26:15,818
- I don't know.
- Well, I did.

816
01:26:16,444 --> 01:26:18,567
My name is not Jessica Bates.

817
01:26:19,238 --> 01:26:21,901
It's Alex Barnes and I work
for the Justice Department.

818
01:26:24,577 --> 01:26:27,246
Your wife's name
is not Rennie, either.

819
01:26:27,413 --> 01:26:30,746
Only, no one seems to know
what her real name is.

820
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:32,208
- Just listen to me!
- Look...

821
01:26:32,268 --> 01:26:34,972
- Under three different names...
- This makes no sense.

822
01:26:35,022 --> 01:26:38,179
she married three different men,
all wealthy men.

823
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:41,297
- What are you trying to do?
- Paul, she killed all of them.

824
01:26:41,467 --> 01:26:42,595
She poisoned them.

825
01:26:42,645 --> 01:26:46,592
Now, she's left town and that's
when they die, when she's gone.

826
01:26:51,151 --> 01:26:54,683
But she doesn't need my money,
I've seen her portfolio, bank accounts...

827
01:26:54,855 --> 01:26:57,855
I just told you how she got them.

828
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:03,911
- I know it sounds like I used you.
- Sounds like?

829
01:27:04,363 --> 01:27:06,854
You can't say that you
didn't know how I felt.

830
01:27:07,032 --> 01:27:11,395
That was Jessie, not some... cop.

831
01:27:12,121 --> 01:27:18,674
Look, Lady, don't feel so bad,
everybody uses everybody.

832
01:27:19,711 --> 01:27:22,202
Only she does it better, right?

833
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:26,300
That's what it is, isn't it?
She does it better.

834
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:29,382
- No, that isn't it.
- And I told myself you could handle it.

835
01:27:29,554 --> 01:27:30,315
I did!

836
01:27:30,365 --> 01:27:32,968
Yeah?!
Then maybe you can explain our wills.

837
01:27:33,139 --> 01:27:38,080
They leave everything...
everything to the Cancer Foundation.

838
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:41,344
<i>Nothing to each other,
it was her idea.

839
01:27:41,523 --> 01:27:44,726
Sound like the woman
you're talking about?

840
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:47,401
Answer me!

841
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:56,320
Tell me there is no jealousy.

842
01:27:57,913 --> 01:28:00,704
No jealousy at all.

843
01:28:23,478 --> 01:28:26,977
They said he'd strangled
in his sleep or something.

844
01:28:30,526 --> 01:28:33,230
Do you know a woman named
Jessica Bates?

845
01:28:33,946 --> 01:28:35,903
I do.

846
01:28:36,073 --> 01:28:40,367
<i>It seems Miss Bates
is a federal agent named Barnes.

847
01:28:40,744 --> 01:28:45,488
And Miss Barnes believes
that you murdered Mr. Nuytten.

848
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:49,460
Paul died last night.

849
01:28:49,627 --> 01:28:53,327
I was in San Francisco,
<i>you can call the hotel.

850
01:28:53,547 --> 01:28:55,457
She thinks you poisoned him.

851
01:28:55,633 --> 01:28:59,048
Something that would take delayed
effect while he slept.

852
01:29:04,265 --> 01:29:06,488
Did you check our home for the poison?

853
01:29:06,893 --> 01:29:10,013
No, there's no probable cause for a warrant.

854
01:29:10,688 --> 01:29:13,177
- That's why I thought you might voluntarily...
- Of course.

855
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:16,683
Yes, check everything you want.

856
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:21,859
And while you're at it...

857
01:29:22,324 --> 01:29:26,820
Jessica Bates,
or whatever her name is...

858
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:32,489
was my husband's lover,
<i>before and after the wedding.

859
01:29:33,584 --> 01:29:36,953
<i>So while you're searching</i> MY HOME...

860
01:29:39,256 --> 01:29:40,632
<i>Interesting.

861
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:44,571
We learned that he went to her
apartment yesterday afternoon.

862
01:30:23,213 --> 01:30:24,872
<i>Please, have a seat.

863
01:30:26,758 --> 01:30:29,130
You've been more than kind...

864
01:30:29,552 --> 01:30:32,222
after what you've been through.

865
01:30:34,349 --> 01:30:38,761
Listen, we did find a toxic compound
in Miss Barnes' apartment.

866
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:42,104
Delayed-action poison.

867
01:30:42,272 --> 01:30:44,680
Also, we have certain photographs.

868
01:30:49,613 --> 01:30:52,483
Photos of Miss Barnes
and your husband.

869
01:30:52,658 --> 01:30:57,523
Those pictures are all my fault, I...

870
01:30:58,913 --> 01:31:02,412
I hired this horrid little man.

871
01:31:03,501 --> 01:31:05,825
How did you get them?

872
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,778
The man you hired
is dead,<i> Mrs. Nuytten.

873
01:31:08,828 --> 01:31:12,291
<i>We assumed of an accidental
overdose of heroin.

874
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:17,088
Now I'm afraid Miss Barnes has more
than just your husband to answer for.

875
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:22,969
<i>How well did you know him?

876
01:31:25,896 --> 01:31:28,185
<i>Back as far as you can.
Thank you.

877
01:31:30,192 --> 01:31:33,924
<i>Did you know Paul Nuytten?
Were you having a love affair with him?

878
01:31:34,537 --> 01:31:39,231
<i>Mrs. Nuytten,</i> the Cancer Foundation
flew<i> Mr. Foster to the Islands because

879
01:31:39,408 --> 01:31:43,073
<i>we seem to have...
well, something of a situation.

880
01:31:43,245 --> 01:31:47,623
- A situation?
- Yes, it's concerning Mr. Nuytten's will.

881
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:52,466
<i>It seems that Mr. Nuytten's legal
residence is the state of Florida.

882
01:31:52,516 --> 01:31:54,080
Were you aware of that?

883
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:56,462
No, should I be?

884
01:31:56,512 --> 01:32:01,768
Florida has a so-called Mortmain
Statute, Mrs. Nuytten.

885
01:32:01,818 --> 01:32:06,470
Any bequest to charity in a will
executed within six months of death...

886
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:09,735
can be invalidated by the spouse.

887
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:13,453
How interesting.

888
01:32:13,516 --> 01:32:17,367
<i>Of course it's</i> no requirement
that you invalidate the gift.

889
01:32:19,445 --> 01:32:23,653
Shortly before his death,
Mr. Foster, my husband...

890
01:32:23,824 --> 01:32:27,359
expressed reservations
about your organization.

891
01:32:30,188 --> 01:32:32,949
Profound reservations.

892
01:32:43,109 --> 01:32:47,046
<i>Miss Barnes called from the jail.

893
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:54,049
<i>I tell her you plan to take long trip.

894
01:33:54,325 --> 01:33:56,650
Treating you...?

895
01:33:57,870 --> 01:34:00,132
You okay?

896
01:34:01,165 --> 01:34:03,452
I can't complain.

897
01:34:05,733 --> 01:34:07,953
There's a lot of psychological tests.

898
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:12,483
Which I find surprising
for a crime of passion.

899
01:34:15,144 --> 01:34:17,548
Not SO surprising.

900
01:34:18,722 --> 01:34:24,016
Well, they don't seem to think
your only motive was jealousy.

901
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:27,428
<i>Not of Paul, anyway.

902
01:34:27,731 --> 01:34:31,478
They seem to think
your obsession was...

903
01:34:32,943 --> 01:34:35,209
with me.

904
01:34:35,259 --> 01:34:38,634
<i>They think you started out as
an ambitious federal agent...

905
01:34:40,534 --> 01:34:43,903
and you became obsessed by this...

906
01:34:44,955 --> 01:34:46,947
phantom.

907
01:34:47,623 --> 01:34:49,699
And then...

908
01:34:50,376 --> 01:34:52,369
you chased her...

909
01:34:53,296 --> 01:34:54,873
and you chased her...

910
01:34:56,465 --> 01:35:00,592
and when you thought you were never
be quick enough to catch her...

911
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:02,877
I killed him...

912
01:35:02,971 --> 01:35:05,801
to frame you.

913
01:35:32,331 --> 01:35:34,454
How did you manage it?

914
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:37,579
What, did you leave town
and sneak back?

915
01:35:38,963 --> 01:35:42,414
Did you use the same bottle
you put in my place?

916
01:35:42,591 --> 01:35:46,884
You always did have a tendency
to over-think things.

917
01:35:47,595 --> 01:35:52,879
The most important thing about figuring
ANYTHING out is knowing... when to stop.

918
01:35:59,314 --> 01:36:01,354
You know...

919
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:06,727
of all the relationships
I'll look back on...

920
01:36:06,905 --> 01:36:09,147
in 50 years' time...

921
01:36:13,727 --> 01:36:17,076
I'll always remember this one.

922
01:36:36,474 --> 01:36:38,482
Hello, Sara.

923
01:36:41,155 --> 01:36:43,271
It's good to see you.

924
01:37:11,089 --> 01:37:15,222
I want you to know I put the poison
in<i> Paul's brandy. You mustn't...

925
01:37:15,306 --> 01:37:17,692
We know, they found it before he did.

926
01:38:26,116 --> 01:38:27,860
Get your cameras, she's here!

927
01:38:28,035 --> 01:38:32,780
<i>Congratulations, that was a brilliant trap.
Are you going back to Washington now?

928
01:38:32,957 --> 01:38:35,282
<i>Were you tipped off
she was here in Hawaii?

929
01:38:35,459 --> 01:38:37,451
<i>Please, give us an answer for the press.

930
01:38:37,627 --> 01:38:40,581
<i>Are you going to testify at the trial?

931
01:38:44,133 --> 01:38:46,840
I will give you the statement.
