1
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:25,732
When he didn't come to the office,
10:30, 11:00...

2
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:29,324
...I called the house.

3
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:30,823
Catharine...

4
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:34,657
...he went in his sleep,
so peacefully.

5
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,160
The doctor said if you slept
next to him...

6
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:40,958
...you wouldn't even have known.

7
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:44,252
You couldn't have done anything.

8
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:57,597
Mrs. Petersen.

9
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:01,142
- Catharine, let me come up with you.
- No.

10
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:03,891
You get some rest, Sara.

11
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,999
Nice blouse, Alex.
- Has been for years, Michael.

12
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,333
I'm late. I spent the whole morning
going over obituaries.

13
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:27,045
The whole morning?

14
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:30,083
<i>Yeah. Detroit Free Press on your list?
April 12th.</i>

15
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:33,460
I don't roll out of bed
and read obituaries before coffee.

16
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:37,005
Wasn't this guy a capo for Marangano
a few years back?

17
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,509
- So?
- So...

18
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:42,466
...two guys die within four days
of each other. What does that say?

19
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:46,689
No pattern. This guy could've been
a hit, but Marangano died in his sleep.

20
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:49,182
He stopped breathing.
They ran a full...

21
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,186
- Not now.
Is that what Bruce thinks?

22
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,393
Alex.

23
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,735
A government pouch to someone's
home is illegal. Worse, it's expensive.

24
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:00,527
Well, my contribution
to the federal deficit.

25
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:08,244
And let go of this Marangano thing.
People die in their sleep. Even dons.

26
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,377
It was a hit!
Hey, keep it down.

27
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,872
He ran trash collection
for half of Jersey.

28
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,719
- You don't die in your sleep of...
Ondine's Curse.

29
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:19,551
"Damage of unknown origin to the part
of the brain that controls breathing."

30
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:21,550
It's rare. It's real. It happens.

31
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:26,554
Yeah, I'm here six years, it never
happened. You do a run on it?

32
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,772
- This the only one?
- It can't be connected.

33
00:06:32,944 --> 00:06:37,108
This guy's not Mafia. He's some
millionaire publisher from New York.

34
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:38,610
"Cause of death unknown.

35
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:41,820
Evidence suggests unexplained
interruption of breathing.

36
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:44,284
Consider possibility of Ondine's Curse.

37
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:49,201
Sam Petersen, age 60. Survived
by his wife of four months, Catharine...

38
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:53,707
...age 31."
- And I had to go back a year to get that.

39
00:06:55,133 --> 00:07:00,376
Alex, it's the only one. Believe me.
Believe me, there's nothing there.

40
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:19,563
I've got it sitting right here
in front of me.

41
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:24,403
Walter, you see, I don't know how
to read the goddamn instructions.

42
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,829
I'm only 5 fucking years old.

43
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,495
Now, you be my daddy,
and you tell me how to use it.

44
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,292
Nice and simple.

45
00:07:35,882 --> 00:07:41,303
Oh, you're goddamn right I'm serious.
But my bride is here for our luncheon.

46
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:44,388
Well, I've never been
anybody's daddy neither.

47
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:49,385
But if you want me to pop for 200,000
units of this little plastic turd here...

48
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,970
...I suggest that you start faking it.

49
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:56,728
<i>How's that wife of yours?
- She don't look so good today.</i>

50
00:07:56,903 --> 00:08:00,402
<i>- She's the best-looking gal in Dallas.
- She looks kind of scrag.</i>

51
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:02,980
<i>Scraggly, my ass.</i>

52
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,948
Write some of these instructions
in English.

53
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,287
<i>- Maybe you can find a market for this.
- I'm on top of it.</i>

54
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:12,541
Yeah, okay, yeah. So long, then.

55
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:18,506
Marielle, you think anybody's gonna
be interested in a thing like this?

56
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:23,965
It's about winning, Ben.
Everybody's interested in winning.

57
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:26,807
They forgot that they're
making this toy for kids.

58
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,928
The instructions are too complicated.

59
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:35,558
Hot damn!

60
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:59,230
I gotta be the world's
number one airhead.

61
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,610
Be gone five days, and I'm packing
half of Neiman Marcus here.

62
00:10:06,114 --> 00:10:07,442
Marielle?

63
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,442
Yeah, hon?

64
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,031
How come we run out of brandy
so quick, hon?

65
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:16,746
Didn't I see a fresh bottle
in the cabinet?

66
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,132
Right again, hon.

67
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:54,570
Marielle, I've explained to Etta
that this will is valid in all respects.

68
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:59,123
Any contest here would just be
a waste of time and money.

69
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,208
My time.

70
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:02,871
My money.

71
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:09,045
What, a man cuts his only sister out of
his will two months after marrying a...?

72
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:10,796
Younger woman?

73
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:16,180
You know something, Etta,
your husband is right.

74
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,722
Ben had no quarrel with you.

75
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:22,144
Only the way you felt about me.

76
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:26,103
I think, if he were here...

77
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:29,861
...he'd regret what he'd done.

78
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,569
Martin?

79
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:38,615
What are the tax consequences
if I make a small gift?

80
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:41,031
Young lady...

81
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:45,874
Marielle is going to go back
to Charleston...

82
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:51,503
...and she doesn't want any
harsh feelings or needless delays.

83
00:11:52,636 --> 00:11:55,886
How small a gift, dear?

84
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,305
Something in the mid-six figures?

85
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:20,321
Miss Barnes! Miss Barnes?

86
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:23,498
Miss Barnes, can I look
in your purse, please?

87
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:28,669
Here she comes!

88
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:40,637
What? You gonna knock over
a liquor store?

89
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:45,387
I was just at the target range.
I'm trying to get certified, that's all.

90
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:50,103
I tell you what.
Send the piece back to Sears.

91
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,322
Remember that Ondine's Curse thing?

92
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,082
Another one came up today.

93
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:07,749
This guy died 10 days ago.

94
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,676
Dinner?

95
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:24,261
What?

96
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:29,014
- I said, dinner? Eat? Tonight?
- I have work left.

97
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,274
Fine. Tomorrow?

98
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:35,610
I don't think it's a good idea.
We work together.

99
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,864
What, office policy? What?

100
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,697
Okay. I resign.

101
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:46,621
I can't afford to lose you.
You're my right arm.

102
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:49,788
Okay.

103
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,421
What did you say about Ondine's Curse?

104
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:00,919
- It's not Mafia.
- What is it?

105
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:04,513
It's a toy manufacturer from Dallas.

106
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:09,974
He's very rich. He's very clean.
I'll get you a printout tomorrow, okay?

107
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:15,684
- Good night.
- Good night.

108
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,948
Michael.

109
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,283
Wait up.

110
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,861
I'm gonna go with you.

111
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,117
Could a Texas toy mogul
have a mob connection?

112
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:36,213
The Texan's a ringer
for that other guy from New York.

113
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:39,169
How's that?
- Well, both older guys, very rich...

114
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:42,379
...each married to a young gal
for a couple of months.

115
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:46,599
- Must be kind of bad for your health.
- Hey, you got a minute?

116
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:59,940
Make some calls to New York, Dallas.
Newspapers, whatever.

117
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:02,272
Let's round up some photos.

118
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:06,067
Shouldn't be hard.
They were prominent guys.

119
00:15:06,662 --> 00:15:08,654
Not the men.

120
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:10,953
The wives.

121
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:32,973
Okay.

122
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:38,313
Seattle guidebooks,
Japanese cooking, what next?

123
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:41,819
- Rare coins.
- What sort of rare coins?

124
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:47,777
Something general for the beginner, then
something more particular. Perhaps...

125
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,661
...Italy, the 19th century.

126
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,866
Before the city-states were unified
or after?

127
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,746
I don't know.
Which would be more...

128
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:59,334
...unusual?

129
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,208
Northwest Indians. Which tribes?

130
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:07,755
Coast Salish, for certain.
Whatever else you have.

131
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:10,718
Tlingit, Bella Coola, Kwakiutl.

132
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:13,098
My primary interest is in totem poles.

133
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,891
What are you,
cramming for a game show?

134
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:24,104
No, I'll take it. Thank you.

135
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:52,499
Come here. Come here, children.
Teachers, let's move them along.

136
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:54,510
Come this way.

137
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:05,851
One million dollars.

138
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:09,890
A very generous offer, Miss Dodd...

139
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:13,154
...but this museum does not sell
places on its board.

140
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:14,651
- Our chairman...
- Yes.

141
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:18,656
I'm sure Mr. McCorey will appreciate
my intentions. Good day.

142
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:25,166
But Margaret,
we want your views on this.

143
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:29,415
Now, I understand you had very
strong feelings about this collection.

144
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:31,996
Mr. McCorey...

145
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:35,211
...I didn't want my first meeting
to be one where I...

146
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:36,880
You disagreed with anybody.

147
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:42,975
I think it's a mistake to concentrate
so exclusively...

148
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,635
...on the Coast Salish in our acquisitions.

149
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:50,519
You want to be the best at something,
but that's not our role.

150
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:52,187
And what is, Margaret?

151
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:55,362
We need to compare all the tribes.

152
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:58,616
We study their art to learn about them.

153
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:02,616
We study them
to understand ourselves.

154
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:10,706
These the best pictures?
She doesn't want pictures.

155
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,667
She knows the camera's there.
She turns away.

156
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:16,379
The Texas one is different,
slimmer body.

157
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:18,877
- It's the way she's stand...
- She's younger.

158
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,890
- It's makeup, hair, attitude.
- I think you're wrong.

159
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:23,600
I could be right.

160
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:27,303
The whole m.o., a complex series
of seductions and murders...

161
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,805
...that's not something
you see a woman do.

162
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:34,810
Oh? Which part you figure a woman isn't
up to? The seduction or the murder?

163
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:37,608
Look, I just want the field assignment.

164
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:40,189
- Please?
- Listen...

165
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:43,072
...data analysis is the heart
of what we do here.

166
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:46,614
The best work in this shop
is yours. The best.

167
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,290
- It's a job you were born to do.
- It's a job with green windows!

168
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:53,248
Bruce, I've been in this office
for six years.

169
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:56,542
This goddamned government
office with green windows.

170
00:20:56,717 --> 00:21:00,797
You want excitement. People
don't look to get it all from their job.

171
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:04,090
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jesus.

172
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:06,935
What do you think it means?
Having a date!

173
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:11,681
When was the last time you rolled in late
on a Monday because of a big weekend?

174
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:15,190
I really can't believe
you're saying this to me!

175
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:18,065
I have to listen to this shit
from my mother!

176
00:21:18,238 --> 00:21:21,405
What the hell do you think
you are, Bruce?

177
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,119
Look, I just...

178
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,574
You're not happy.

179
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:36,916
You're not a happy person.

180
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,125
And you deserve to be, that's all.

181
00:21:42,554 --> 00:21:46,053
Bruce, make me happy.

182
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:58,651
Even if you're right, it isn't federal.

183
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:04,779
Whatever you can't fit on the
weekends, make sure you call in sick.

184
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:08,907
Thanks.

185
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:21,963
She was destroyed by his death.
They were very devoted.

186
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:26,179
Catharine needed to get away,
and she went to Europe.

187
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:29,716
That was over a year ago.
Have you heard from her?

188
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:34,389
I had a postcard from Rome. I had
a lovely note from Vienna, a little gift.

189
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:39,060
All in the first month, or thereabouts.
Anything lately?

190
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:41,312
Only the attorney.

191
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:44,903
He received instructions
to convert the estate into cash...

192
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,986
...and to transfer the funds
to a Swiss account.

193
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:51,993
No one else in Manhattan,
not a single soul.

194
00:22:52,165 --> 00:22:55,368
Everyone says the same thing.
From Chicago, no family...

195
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:58,959
...they don't know where she lived,
where she worked.

196
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,964
Could I have this photograph?

197
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:10,962
I'm sorry.
That must have sounded awful.

198
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:18,810
Sara, it's just that she came out of thin
air, and she vanished back into thin air.

199
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:23,230
- Well, is that against the law?
- It's odd. I find it odd.

200
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:29,570
Sam Petersen is gone.
So is all of his property, his money.

201
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:34,779
And if I loved him as much as you did,
I'd find it very odd indeed.

202
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:44,831
That's Felice Baciocchi
and her sister Elisa.

203
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:51,218
You probably looked all this up
just to impress me.

204
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:55,424
Did it work?

205
00:23:55,936 --> 00:24:02,389
Well, you know, I really did wonder.
You seem almost too good to be true.

206
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:06,194
I thought of checking up on you.

207
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:13,491
Not a bad thought.

208
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:17,363
After all, I could be
practically anybody.

209
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,869
Dangerous not to check people out.

210
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:23,203
I did.

211
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:28,462
And what did you find?

212
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:35,267
I found that you went to Mount
Holyoke, you studied anthropology...

213
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,719
...and I found...

214
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,892
...we're a lot alike.

215
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,695
We like Italy, and we like coins.

216
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,441
And we like to live alone.

217
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,531
You never talk about that.

218
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,833
I don't know why I never married.

219
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,706
I have a serviceable list of reasons.

220
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:10,466
Take out my reasons
and polish them every once in a while.

221
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:14,089
I kept on growing out
in all these...

222
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:18,427
...peculiar and idiosyncratic directions.

223
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:23,100
I'd put on a little bristle here
and a bristle there...

224
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,396
...and sort of...

225
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,773
...turned myself into a porcupine.

226
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:36,366
- What?
- Well, it's just such an old joke.

227
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,908
How do two porcupines...

228
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,452
...make love?

229
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,333
Very carefully.

230
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:57,420
To the left, right around this corner.
You'll find it.

231
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,894
It's kind of you to make time
in your busy schedule for me.

232
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,028
No trouble at all.

233
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,858
So have you thought at all
about what I said?

234
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,988
Uh-huh. You know something?

235
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,697
That very same idea occurred to me
right after the funeral.

236
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,831
I even hired a detective.

237
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:30,295
Sent him over to Charleston,
where she said her people were at.

238
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:34,165
There was nothing at all.
No family, not even a trace.

239
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,339
Why didn't you come forward, Etta?

240
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,806
Ben was gone.
I couldn't bring him back.

241
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,391
I thought, "It'll be in the papers."
I didn't want a big scandal.

242
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,184
Okay, about the will, Etta.

243
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:51,642
Rice Institute was the only
other beneficiary, wasn't it?

244
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,570
Yes. Ben was gracious and...

245
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,490
And I bet you wondered
if Marielle got caught...

246
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:00,943
...Rice might just take back
that little gift she gave you.

247
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,962
You're looking a little peaked, dear.

248
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,835
Can I buy you a tan?

249
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:01,428
I've been coming here about this time
of year since I was 5 years old.

250
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,848
And every year, when we'd leave...

251
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,055
...I'd feel this sense of...

252
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,065
...Ioss, I suppose.

253
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:24,985
Always promised myself
I'd live here someday.

254
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,827
Why don't you?

255
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,039
Why don't we?

256
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,573
What is this thing?
You almost broke my tooth.

257
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:14,580
Medic alert.
I'm allergic to penicillin.

258
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,469
We're done. We're all done.

259
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,638
Last hand, you guys.

260
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:38,732
Herb's got it, honey.
He's got that look.

261
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:43,234
That's the look?
That's the look.

262
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:45,279
Yeah, I'm done.

263
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:48,735
You do got it,
you lame son of a bitch.

264
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:56,490
I'll see your 20
and kick you 20.

265
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:59,338
What is that, suicide?
Some kind of sympathy ploy?

266
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:03,337
- Called putting up your money. Herbert?
- I got it, Alex. Keep your 40.

267
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:06,465
Kick me back.

268
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,964
Just call. All blue, darling.

269
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:15,137
Remember last week?

270
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:19,144
- I think we're even now, baby.
Yeah, well, I gotta get out of here.

271
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,269
Hold on a second, will you, please?

272
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:25,485
- Guys, come on.
Take it easy!

273
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:28,028
This is my money. I've got about...

274
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,201
I got about 40, 50, $60 here.

275
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,446
I already got this money spent.

276
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:36,113
Yeah, what are you buying?
New underwear?

277
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:42,126
You took Alex out once, didn't you?
Yeah, Redskins game.

278
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:45,049
So how'd it go?

279
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:46,926
Skins lost.

280
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:52,097
Hi.

281
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:54,756
You want your neck rubbed?

282
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:57,223
No.

283
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:02,517
I want my neck rubbed.

284
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,687
- Oh, man.
- Thinking about your Borgia lady?

285
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:10,324
Uh-huh.

286
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:14,780
- You figure out how she hits them?
- Oh, Christ, I don't know.

287
00:31:14,954 --> 00:31:19,118
It could be methadone.
It leaves a negligible trace.

288
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:22,418
You know how many men over 50...

289
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:25,504
...married women under 40
in the last four months?

290
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,126
No.

291
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:30,258
Neither do I.

292
00:31:31,262 --> 00:31:34,678
Now try the top 30 cities.

293
00:31:35,516 --> 00:31:37,805
You tell me.

294
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:45,108
Exactly a zillion.

295
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:48,190
And that's the easy part.

296
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:51,981
Now try crossing that
against millionaires.

297
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:54,447
Get photos of the women.

298
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:57,823
And you could use more computer time.

299
00:31:57,997 --> 00:31:59,871
No, I'm there.

300
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,040
I'm down to six ladies.

301
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:05,452
That includes the two
I got this week.

302
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,037
You can't be traveling
all over the country...

303
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:10,967
No, I gotta check it out.

304
00:32:11,135 --> 00:32:13,424
I gotta check them out.

305
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:19,263
What, are you scared for me?

306
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:22,600
You're full of shit, Bruce.

307
00:32:24,065 --> 00:32:26,353
Call you from Denver.

308
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:29,060
Maybe Seattle.

309
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:31,564
See you.

310
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:35,572
<i>Pull your cars
as far forward as possible.</i>

311
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:37,819
<i>Stop your engine.</i>

312
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:41,159
<i>Set your emergency brake.</i>

313
00:33:54,362 --> 00:33:57,482
Everything's fine.
You can get dressed.

314
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:03,157
Doctor, I almost forgot.
I have this recurring tonsillitis and...

315
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,655
...well, with this Seattle weather...

316
00:34:05,832 --> 00:34:08,157
What usually works for you?

317
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:10,208
Penicillin.

318
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,420
I think she said her degree
was in anthropology.

319
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:16,832
Vassar or Smith or...

320
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,426
- And she was originally from...?
- New England, I think.

321
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:24,013
Maybe it wasn't. It's funny.
I see her three times a week and...

322
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:26,930
Sally, is Mrs. McCorey across the hall?

323
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:30,721
Please check. I have a reporter
who'd like some background on her.

324
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,306
I'd rather not bother her,
if you don't mind.

325
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:37,690
I don't like to impose on my subjects
till I have something written up...

326
00:34:37,864 --> 00:34:40,355
...you know, in case they want
to make changes.

327
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,360
Margaret isn't in this morning.

328
00:34:42,535 --> 00:34:45,287
William, this is Mrs. Talley.

329
00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:47,412
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

330
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:50,197
<i>She's with the Post-Intelligencer.</i>

331
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:53,834
They're doing a piece on our
more prominent women volunteers.

332
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:57,789
I know your managing editor well.
You're on metro desk, features?

333
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:01,965
I'm not with the paper, actually.
I'm freelance.

334
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:04,545
I was hoping they would
pick up an article.

335
00:35:04,724 --> 00:35:06,348
I'm working in the storeroom.

336
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:08,510
- Why don't we talk there?
- Fine.

337
00:35:12,356 --> 00:35:14,479
Please don't touch anything down here.

338
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,817
- Your home phone?
- Well, I don't live here in town.

339
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:23,443
- So you're staying at the...?
- The Hilton.

340
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:25,527
- Look...
- Airport?

341
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:27,078
Downtown.

342
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:29,955
Just one question.

343
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,453
Why did you lie back there
about the paper?

344
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:39,507
I'm sorry. I really am, I...

345
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:42,210
See, I'm just starting out.

346
00:35:42,386 --> 00:35:45,802
<i>I thought an article on powerful
women might sell to Cosmo...</i>

347
00:35:46,015 --> 00:35:49,051
<i>...or Woman 's Day, and so...
- Oh, yeah, I see, I see.</i>

348
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:53,847
I never had to prove myself like that.

349
00:35:55,107 --> 00:35:57,064
It must be hard for you.

350
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:03,655
My wife's a very private person,
and I respect that.

351
00:36:04,491 --> 00:36:08,868
But let me talk to her, and we'll see
if we can't help you out.

352
00:36:10,122 --> 00:36:12,874
That's very understanding of you.

353
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,510
Anything else?

354
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:37,021
I think that's it, thanks.

355
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:45,814
Hey! Hey, Leo, will you fix that screen?

356
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:48,660
Okay, I'll fix it!

357
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:50,404
- All right!
Come on, man!

358
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,571
- I'll fix it!
Another movie on survival?

359
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:55,452
<i>Just because
you can 't see a suspect...</i>

360
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,250
<i>... doesn 't mean he can 't see you.</i>

361
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:01,376
There's a resemblance, but I've seen
strangers who look like twins.

362
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:05,545
You're looking for a reason to kiss
this off because you can't stomach it.

363
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,842
Yeah, what are you looking for?

364
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:11,263
Why do you wanna bury this lady?
Two guys die of some curse?

365
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:15,015
Ondine's Curse. They died in their sleep.
They stopped breathing.

366
00:37:15,186 --> 00:37:17,724
When McCorey dies
of the same thing, call me.

367
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:20,223
You said the wives were out of town.

368
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:23,569
She poisoned them.
She put it in some...

369
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:26,227
Something she thought
they'd drink or eat.

370
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:28,358
These boys were autopsied.

371
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:31,700
You got cops in New York or Dallas
wanna dig up the bodies?

372
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:35,535
No, but you want me to tell one
of the richest men in this state...

373
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:38,494
...that some Fed thinks
his wife's a murderer...

374
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,536
...when nobody thinks
there's a homicide.

375
00:37:40,712 --> 00:37:44,211
You're right. You solved
the whole case from your desk.

376
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:46,540
Why not take the rest of the day off?

377
00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:49,713
You're absolutely right.
Hello, Mrs. McCorey?

378
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:53,879
Would you come to the station
and tell us if you ever killed anybody?

379
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,474
No, ma'am, we don't have any evidence.

380
00:37:56,644 --> 00:38:00,179
I just spent the whole morning
showing you the evidence!

381
00:38:00,398 --> 00:38:03,399
If that's what the Justice Department
calls evidence...

382
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:06,901
...then that is the scariest part
of this whole conversation.

383
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:13,149
The thing is, I know I'm right.

384
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:34,049
So, what do you think?

385
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:36,216
The playing's better than the piano.

386
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:38,384
Oh, right.

387
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:41,510
I'll get a tuner out here tomorrow.

388
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:48,441
Oh, a young woman stopped
by the museum.

389
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:51,779
She's researching an article about you.

390
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:55,899
I liked her.
She seemed really very sweet.

391
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:58,955
Fix you a gin?

392
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,704
Ma'am.

393
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:10,750
Check again.

394
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:14,674
Look, she told my husband
she was here waiting for a call.

395
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:16,799
She was here.

396
00:39:16,974 --> 00:39:21,801
Checked out this afternoon.
Transferring to the Inn at the Market.

397
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:24,683
Perhaps I could call for you.

398
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:02,636
Shit!

399
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,014
Margaret?

400
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:35,683
Yeah, I'm up here!
- Oh, I'll come up.

401
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:38,894
No, no, no.
I'll be down in just a minute.

402
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,484
I thought you were fishing.
No luck?

403
00:41:45,663 --> 00:41:49,447
I was gonna call the lawyer
about the board meeting.

404
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:52,542
I think it's a mistake, sweetheart.

405
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:55,463
Shit.

406
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:00,672
It's a family business.

407
00:42:02,763 --> 00:42:07,970
You put me on another board,
there'll just be conflict and resentment.

408
00:42:08,602 --> 00:42:11,354
You're my wife.
I want you with me.

409
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:18,183
I do like the way you say that.

410
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:23,444
- Where'd they find him?
- Look, Agatha Christie.

411
00:42:23,617 --> 00:42:28,326
He didn't die of any breathing disease.
Just a good old-fashioned heart attack.

412
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:30,330
- Did they do an autopsy?
- Yes...

413
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,747
...they did, and a toxicology screen.

414
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:36,743
Great, that covers about 60
compounds at the outside.

415
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:40,956
You think she wouldn't
know what to avoid?

416
00:42:43,845 --> 00:42:46,383
Anaphylactic shock looks
like cardiac arrest.

417
00:42:46,556 --> 00:42:48,549
Was he allergic to something?

418
00:42:48,725 --> 00:42:51,928
- Bee venom? Antibiotics?
- Bee venom!

419
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,891
Bee venom.
You're not gonna believe this...

420
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:58,855
...but I overlooked that possibility.
Boy, that's gonna be my ass.

421
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:01,690
She's left town,
and you don't know where.

422
00:43:01,905 --> 00:43:05,855
Lady, there's been no homicide.
Why should I care where she went?

423
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:08,946
Enough to know she's left.
You're scared shitless.

424
00:43:09,162 --> 00:43:13,456
They're gonna find out about me
and wonder why you didn't check it out.

425
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:17,878
If you got a complaint, go file it.
Otherwise, please, go fuck yourself.

426
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:37,856
It's not a reason.

427
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:42,395
I was in the room with him.
He was four feet away from me.

428
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:46,063
- And what were you supposed to do?
- I don't know.

429
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,734
I just...

430
00:43:50,703 --> 00:43:52,363
...should have...

431
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,153
...said it. Told him.
- He'd have believed you?

432
00:43:55,374 --> 00:43:58,375
He would have had a chance.
I didn't give him a chance!

433
00:43:58,544 --> 00:44:02,922
He would've gone straight to her,
then you're blown and she's gone.

434
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,581
And maybe he's alive.

435
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:12,715
Alex, you don't quit your job...

436
00:44:12,892 --> 00:44:14,600
...six years...

437
00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:18,102
...to go chasing after some phantom!

438
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:24,561
She's not a phantom.

439
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,240
Come on. Come on!

440
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:37,908
We got her. I think we got her.
I think we finally got her.

441
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:01,478
Hi.
Hi.

442
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,018
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

443
00:45:07,112 --> 00:45:08,606
This is from me.

444
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:10,903
I already have my ticket to Hawaii.

445
00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:13,150
That's your ticket back.

446
00:45:14,828 --> 00:45:17,533
What makes you so sure
she's even there?

447
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:23,210
Michael says the lady at the ticket
counter in Seattle recognized her photo.

448
00:45:23,378 --> 00:45:26,961
Who's to say she didn't fly out of Hawaii
under any name at all?

449
00:45:27,132 --> 00:45:29,208
Maybe she did.

450
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,966
Where else am I gonna start?

451
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:40,934
I heard you sold all your stuff.
- Yeah.

452
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:43,642
- What'd you get for the BMW?
- Well...

453
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:47,184
...I got 5900 for it.
Blue Book said 66...

454
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,109
...but the salesman was wearing
a bow tie and I was in a hurry.

455
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,649
Would you do me a favor?

456
00:45:56,745 --> 00:45:58,654
Would you get this back to Sears?

457
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:07,627
- Don't underestimate this woman.
- She's not about guns.

458
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:10,964
You want to catch her,
you gotta think like she thinks.

459
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:12,509
I think.

460
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:16,088
And you figure you know her, huh?
Why she does it?

461
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:18,055
Tell me.

462
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:23,432
When I was a kid, my father...
I told you this story, though, didn't I?

463
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:25,686
My dad had quite a temper.

464
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:28,941
He used to take off after me
with this spatula, you know.

465
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,859
Stainless steel pancake turner.
Man, that thing stung like hell.

466
00:46:33,031 --> 00:46:35,985
One of these times,
he chased me down the hall...

467
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:40,156
...and he got me into my bedroom,
and he was beating the crap out of me.

468
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,575
Man.

469
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:44,665
And he stood up, keeled over and died.

470
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:49,749
I figure Margaret,
or whatever her name is...

471
00:46:49,922 --> 00:46:53,920
...has some deep resentment
against older men and...

472
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,213
Are you buying this?

473
00:46:56,387 --> 00:46:59,341
I can't believe you really went for it.

474
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:01,724
Goddamn it.

475
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:04,971
Don't you know? No one knows
why anyone does anything.

476
00:47:05,146 --> 00:47:08,894
I know she's obsessed with killing
and you're obsessed with her.

477
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:12,852
What worries me is that
you might be as wacky as she is.

478
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:17,030
I'll be back with a tan.

479
00:47:31,172 --> 00:47:35,216
Over here, all of you going
to Kilauea, line up here please.

480
00:48:32,566 --> 00:48:34,854
Whoo.

481
00:49:30,206 --> 00:49:34,038
We are standing at the newest
place on this planet.

482
00:49:36,337 --> 00:49:39,671
It's like nowhere on Earth.

483
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:44,876
I love this place!

484
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:52,847
Everybody comes to Hawaii
for the sand, for the beach...

485
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,184
...but to put a hotel here,
it would cost a fortune.

486
00:49:59,694 --> 00:50:02,019
Do you know what?

487
00:50:02,196 --> 00:50:05,197
My bankers say I'm insane.

488
00:50:07,827 --> 00:50:12,489
God, in the right spot,
it would be fantastic!

489
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:33,092
You always been impatient, lady?
I mean, your whole life?

490
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:37,397
Mr. Shin, in four weeks
I've given you $600.

491
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:40,234
You, by way of contrast,
have given me zip.

492
00:50:40,818 --> 00:50:43,902
I'm surprised you can find
your office in the morning.

493
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:48,532
You always sarcastic like that?
You were sarcastic little baby?

494
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:51,618
You look for lady for four weeks, huh?

495
00:50:51,787 --> 00:50:54,574
One time I look for somebody
for 18 years.

496
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,618
Quite a recommendation.

497
00:50:58,293 --> 00:51:00,416
Persistence.

498
00:51:00,587 --> 00:51:05,415
Besides, can't find such a pretty lady
for buck and a half a week.

499
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:08,926
- Need incentive bonus.
- No, just show me what you've got.

500
00:51:09,304 --> 00:51:11,463
What do you mean, huh?
I got nothing.

501
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,807
Mr. Shin, any man that would ask me
for a price increase...

502
00:51:14,977 --> 00:51:18,346
...without anything to deliver
would be kind of stupid.

503
00:51:18,522 --> 00:51:20,728
No point in insulting
your intelligence.

504
00:51:20,941 --> 00:51:23,942
I'd rather do business on a basis
of mutual respect.

505
00:51:24,444 --> 00:51:26,318
That's good.

506
00:51:26,488 --> 00:51:28,979
- I like respect.
- Fine.

507
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:30,825
Where is she?

508
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:33,829
All right, ladies,
before we re-enter the pool...

509
00:51:33,995 --> 00:51:39,416
...let's review the most important rule:
Never race your bubbles to the surface.

510
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:45,872
It can cause lung expansion, which
can result in air in the bloodstream.

511
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:50,177
This can produce an embolism,
which can result in...

512
00:51:50,345 --> 00:51:53,928
- You all right? Maybe you should sit out.
- A very agonizing death.

513
00:51:55,934 --> 00:51:58,721
Now then, ladies, let's get in the pool.

514
00:52:05,318 --> 00:52:07,525
Good. Okay, ladies,
come around here.

515
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:10,691
Come on. Come on, all of you.

516
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:15,907
We're going to pair up and practice
breathing two on the same regulator.

517
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,831
This would be necessary
when one runs out of air.

518
00:52:18,998 --> 00:52:21,287
Now pair up. You and you.
You and you.

519
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:27,166
That's right. Take the regulator and give
it to your partner for emergency air.

520
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,507
Partners? Don't worry.
I'm not really contagious.

521
00:52:30,677 --> 00:52:34,626
My friend promised me she'd
be my partner, so...

522
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:38,797
Well, that leaves me odd man out,
doesn't it?

523
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,894
- Rennie Walker.
- Jessica Bates.

524
00:52:43,064 --> 00:52:45,934
- Jessica Bates, I owe you a beer.
- Take you up on it.

525
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:49,109
Now you take the regulator
in your right hand...

526
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,234
...you take two breaths from it,
and then you give it to your partner.

527
00:52:53,408 --> 00:52:57,191
She takes two breaths from it,
and then you take it back...

528
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,739
...and you breathe into it twice.

529
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:05,116
On five, you blow out.
Don't hold her nose so tight.

530
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:08,461
You have to close her nose,
but don't rip it off her face.

531
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:10,956
And keep your hand on the back
of her neck.

532
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:14,585
If her airway closes,
she will not be able to breathe.

533
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:17,087
You're not taking this personally,
are you?

534
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:18,675
Don't worry.
- Okay.

535
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:20,889
Okay, that's it for this afternoon.

536
00:53:21,102 --> 00:53:25,645
Thank you for your participation.
You can all go. Thank you.

537
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,193
What's your name again?

538
00:53:33,364 --> 00:53:34,739
- Rennie.
- Rennie.

539
00:53:37,076 --> 00:53:40,741
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just hanging out.

540
00:53:41,372 --> 00:53:43,329
Spending my money.

541
00:53:50,547 --> 00:53:52,457
What are you looking at?

542
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:56,844
Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's just that
we spent most of the day in the pool...

543
00:53:57,012 --> 00:54:00,179
...and you come out looking like that
and I look like this.

544
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:02,804
I just wondered why that is.

545
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:09,139
You don't look bad.

546
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:10,810
New suit might help, though.

547
00:54:11,026 --> 00:54:16,400
Oh, it's just the suit? Great.
I'm on a budget.

548
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,328
What?

549
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:27,494
What do you say we go up to my room,
have a couple of decent drinks?

550
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:28,913
All right.

551
00:54:33,715 --> 00:54:37,333
- You married or what?
- Nope.

552
00:54:39,471 --> 00:54:41,428
Not at the moment.

553
00:54:42,474 --> 00:54:45,179
Thank you. Who's this?

554
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:47,060
You like that, do you?

555
00:54:47,229 --> 00:54:50,432
Men that look like this,
you usually end up supporting.

556
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:56,479
His name's Paul Nuytten, and he owns
half a dozen hotels around the world.

557
00:54:56,655 --> 00:55:02,278
Does he have a brother? Cousin?
Young grandfather?

558
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,871
He's having a party tonight.
Do you want to come?

559
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,533
What?

560
00:55:07,707 --> 00:55:10,993
He's having a party tonight.
Do you want to come?

561
00:55:11,169 --> 00:55:15,036
Oh, I can't. I left all my designer
stuff back in Chicago.

562
00:55:15,215 --> 00:55:18,749
Well, that's all right.
You can borrow something of mine.

563
00:55:25,266 --> 00:55:27,508
Could I borrow your hair?

564
00:55:28,895 --> 00:55:30,555
How about your hairdresser?

565
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:32,393
Sure.

566
00:55:41,991 --> 00:55:43,320
- You look pretty.
Thanks.

567
00:55:43,493 --> 00:55:45,153
- You gonna be okay?
- I think so.

568
00:55:45,328 --> 00:55:47,320
I'll catch you later.

569
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,325
Gin and tonic.

570
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:02,128
Thank you.

571
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:45,302
Oh, I know this dress,
but who is the woman?

572
00:56:45,721 --> 00:56:49,304
Paul Nuytten, my new pal,
Jessica Bates.

573
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:51,183
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Welcome.

574
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:53,475
Thank you.
You have a beautiful home.

575
00:56:53,646 --> 00:56:55,519
Thank you.

576
00:56:57,191 --> 00:57:00,357
Would you like to dance?

577
00:57:00,944 --> 00:57:05,274
No. Thanks.
I have new shoes.

578
00:57:26,595 --> 00:57:28,671
Mademoiselle.

579
00:57:28,889 --> 00:57:31,012
Thank you. What's your name?

580
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:34,759
- Tran.
- Tran?

581
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:39,307
Rennie.

582
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:45,150
Tonight you stay?

583
00:57:47,032 --> 00:57:49,986
You have a very busy day tomorrow.

584
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,449
You have to polish your boat...

585
00:57:53,288 --> 00:57:55,577
...hunt some wild boar.

586
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:01,001
Oh, Paul.

587
00:58:02,464 --> 00:58:05,797
You have your little phone book,
lots of numbers.

588
00:58:09,554 --> 00:58:12,472
Why do we keep having
this conversation?

589
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:15,222
It's you.

590
00:58:15,393 --> 00:58:17,884
It's you I want.

591
00:58:24,027 --> 00:58:27,692
All you want is the woman
you haven't slept with.

592
00:58:28,198 --> 00:58:31,234
That's not the same as wanting me.

593
00:58:41,961 --> 00:58:43,669
Paul.

594
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:47,088
I need a kiss.

595
00:59:22,335 --> 00:59:24,208
Fresh fish!

596
00:59:27,757 --> 00:59:31,588
Aku! Fresh aku! Aku!
Freshest fish!

597
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,798
- Fish! Fish!
That one.

598
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,849
- Two pounds.
Hey!

599
00:59:41,854 --> 00:59:44,427
I see you've caught your fish after all.

600
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:48,567
Oh, can't place my face, huh?
Forgetting is useful skill.

601
00:59:48,736 --> 00:59:52,235
- I could learn some of that some time.
- Take out your cigarettes.

602
00:59:52,406 --> 00:59:55,075
Take out your cigarettes
and offer me one.

603
00:59:56,035 --> 01:00:00,079
No, thanks. This is federal government.
You don't wanna lose your license.

604
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:02,495
Point. At the fish.

605
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:04,789
- Say thank you and goodbye.
- Thank you.

606
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:06,330
Goodbye.

607
01:00:14,136 --> 01:00:15,630
Who was that guy?

608
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:19,054
He's a local, and he's asking me
if the fish is fresh.

609
01:00:25,314 --> 01:00:27,022
<i>- Hello?
Sara?</i>

610
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,559
- Yes?
- Sara, it's Catharine.

611
01:00:30,736 --> 01:00:34,520
- Petersen.
- Catharine!

612
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:38,067
It's been such a long time.
Are you all right?

613
01:00:38,285 --> 01:00:42,199
Well, I have a situation actually.

614
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,871
Apparently, there's been a woman
reporter asking questions about me...

615
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,703
...and Sam.

616
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,417
Has anyone like that been
around to see you?

617
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:56,501
<i>Well, yes. There was a young woman
by here about six months ago.</i>

618
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,175
But she was from
the federal government.

619
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:05,809
Listen, Sara, I really must go
right now...

620
01:01:05,979 --> 01:01:08,137
...but I'll phone you later to catch up.

621
01:01:08,315 --> 01:01:11,399
It's been a long time,
and I would like to keep in touch.

622
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:13,062
I'll talk to you later, bye.

623
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:43,144
I'll do it. I'll do it!

624
01:04:44,696 --> 01:04:48,740
The goddamn gauge said half full.
How come there was no air in it?

625
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:53,318
I was supposed to check these things.

626
01:04:58,918 --> 01:05:02,453
If I was a little further out
or had my back turned...

627
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:06,131
You scared the shit out of me.

628
01:05:07,969 --> 01:05:10,590
Thanks for not having your back turned.

629
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:43,379
I'll be right down.

630
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,647
Hey!

631
01:06:05,234 --> 01:06:07,807
You really like those things?

632
01:06:08,737 --> 01:06:11,311
My second husband was addicted.

633
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:14,153
Second husband?
How many have you had?

634
01:06:14,326 --> 01:06:18,703
Lots. That's how I got rich.

635
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:21,959
Once wasn't enough to get rich?

636
01:06:22,417 --> 01:06:24,540
Rich is hard.

637
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:28,921
You never really figure
you're quite there.

638
01:06:29,508 --> 01:06:31,251
That sounds pretty romantic.

639
01:06:34,054 --> 01:06:35,632
Well...

640
01:06:36,765 --> 01:06:38,722
...I used to think of it as my job.

641
01:06:40,352 --> 01:06:42,807
Making myself appealing.

642
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:46,603
I was a professional.

643
01:07:06,836 --> 01:07:11,498
L... I loved every one of them.

644
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:16,712
Deeply.

645
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:20,593
Honestly.

646
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:28,055
It wouldn't have worked any other way.

647
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:37,906
You like him.

648
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:43,910
Paul. You like him.

649
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:50,250
Go for it.

650
01:07:51,339 --> 01:07:53,378
He wants you to.

651
01:07:58,471 --> 01:08:00,796
He needs somebody now...

652
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:03,049
...who knows how to commit.

653
01:08:07,813 --> 01:08:11,597
They're arguing over some woman
named Pelé, like the soccer player.

654
01:08:11,776 --> 01:08:14,942
One argues that she's going
on the warpath on Tuesday.

655
01:08:15,112 --> 01:08:17,354
The other guy says,
"No, next Wednesday."

656
01:08:17,531 --> 01:08:19,607
Six guys got into the same argument...

657
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:23,651
...like they all know the same woman.
- No, no. Pelé is a goddess.

658
01:08:23,829 --> 01:08:28,575
Goddess of devastation.
She lives in a volcano. Kilauea.

659
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:31,668
And every so often she makes fire.

660
01:08:31,837 --> 01:08:33,296
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

661
01:08:33,464 --> 01:08:35,622
- Coffee?
No.

662
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,919
Thank you.
You okay?

663
01:08:39,345 --> 01:08:43,045
I don't feel too well actually.
I think I'll go back to the hotel.

664
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:49,432
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

665
01:08:55,277 --> 01:08:59,227
- I'll drive you home.
- Don't be ridiculous.

666
01:08:59,406 --> 01:09:01,695
It's only a headache.

667
01:09:03,327 --> 01:09:06,826
I'll call you tonight.
We'll do something tomorrow.

668
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:12,454
Look, you and Jessie
go on with your afternoon. Okay?

669
01:09:13,545 --> 01:09:15,004
And have a nice time.

670
01:09:43,158 --> 01:09:46,823
Tran, did he work
for your family in Indochina?

671
01:09:47,078 --> 01:09:48,323
Huh?

672
01:09:48,955 --> 01:09:54,329
It's just that you and he seem so close.
Did he work for another family?

673
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:57,079
Your wife's?

674
01:10:00,008 --> 01:10:02,084
It's just that I sense...

675
01:10:02,761 --> 01:10:05,002
She was killed.

676
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,587
She was only 19.

677
01:10:07,766 --> 01:10:09,260
I'm sorry.

678
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:14,313
And I'm sorry I made you think of it.

679
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:19,941
It's a rare gift to see things
that others cannot.

680
01:10:20,653 --> 01:10:23,571
It drives some people away.

681
01:10:24,991 --> 01:10:29,986
I don't think people like you to know
things before they're ready to tell you.

682
01:10:30,163 --> 01:10:33,698
So I should just learn
to keep my mouth shut.

683
01:10:39,339 --> 01:10:42,423
Won't you see some of the island?

684
01:10:45,386 --> 01:10:47,178
Yes, I'd like that.

685
01:11:11,746 --> 01:11:14,996
Why are you smiling?
- Because you have a look on your face.

686
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,324
Look?
- Like you want to ask something...

687
01:11:17,501 --> 01:11:20,039
...then you don't.
You ought to just ask it.

688
01:11:20,212 --> 01:11:24,162
No, I was just thinking,
why hasn't this woman married?

689
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:27,295
Attractive, intelligent.

690
01:11:27,678 --> 01:11:29,718
Very, very strong.

691
01:11:29,889 --> 01:11:32,759
- She is.
- She?

692
01:11:32,933 --> 01:11:34,760
But I'm talking about you.

693
01:11:36,937 --> 01:11:38,313
So...

694
01:11:38,481 --> 01:11:41,684
...what about you and men?

695
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:44,938
Bad timing.

696
01:11:45,362 --> 01:11:48,197
Maybe a little bit of fear?

697
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,116
Tell you something about that.

698
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:54,451
It's very, very provocative.

699
01:13:03,106 --> 01:13:04,648
Such a strange place.

700
01:13:04,816 --> 01:13:08,315
The sap from the trees cools the lava.

701
01:13:11,406 --> 01:13:13,149
- Paul?
- Huh.

702
01:13:13,366 --> 01:13:16,616
- About Rennie.
- I'm not with Rennie.

703
01:13:17,537 --> 01:13:19,494
I'm with you.

704
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,411
I can't compete with her.

705
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:25,910
There is no necessity.

706
01:13:29,048 --> 01:13:35,217
I have to know whatever this is
is something honest and just for me.

707
01:13:35,972 --> 01:13:37,680
Look at me.

708
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:40,807
Look at me.

709
01:13:42,854 --> 01:13:44,893
Decide.

710
01:14:09,422 --> 01:14:10,702
Here?

711
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:14,874
I mean, can we turn
out the lights or something?

712
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,252
No knock? Come into
a person's office, no knock?

713
01:14:50,421 --> 01:14:51,749
I'm sorry.

714
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:56,668
I knock. I come to your office, I knock.
Where were you born, anyway?

715
01:14:56,844 --> 01:15:00,177
- Wisconsin. Should I come back later?
- No.

716
01:15:00,347 --> 01:15:03,930
Too late to come back later.
You already no knock.

717
01:15:04,101 --> 01:15:06,010
What you want, Wisconsin?

718
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,888
Mr. Shin, my name is Rennie Walker.

719
01:15:12,776 --> 01:15:15,813
This woman befriended me.

720
01:15:16,029 --> 01:15:19,114
And now I think she's seeing my fiancé.

721
01:15:22,911 --> 01:15:24,489
I really must know.

722
01:15:24,788 --> 01:15:28,572
No, no, no. I no do this kind of work.
Not respectable.

723
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:32,706
Mr. Shin, I'll tell you
two things about me.

724
01:15:32,879 --> 01:15:35,370
I'm very rich.

725
01:15:37,217 --> 01:15:39,542
And I'm very wealthy.

726
01:17:11,644 --> 01:17:15,594
I'm sorry about Jessie.
I thought it was what you wanted.

727
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:21,772
Do you understand, Rennie?

728
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:29,616
Long drive back.

729
01:17:30,663 --> 01:17:32,739
Fix me a drink?

730
01:17:56,522 --> 01:17:59,606
Rennie? Rennie?

731
01:18:01,193 --> 01:18:04,776
Come in. I want you to.

732
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:08,316
Why tonight, after all this time?

733
01:18:08,534 --> 01:18:09,648
Huh?

734
01:18:11,161 --> 01:18:14,198
I think we've waited long enough.

735
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:28,602
Just a minute.

736
01:19:32,992 --> 01:19:36,610
- Morning.
- Good morning.

737
01:19:44,629 --> 01:19:48,329
You left this in the Jeep
the other day.

738
01:19:48,508 --> 01:19:52,208
So you drove all the way
over just to deliver a sweater?

739
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,296
No. Not exactly.

740
01:19:55,348 --> 01:19:59,642
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

741
01:20:03,356 --> 01:20:05,183
I have something to tell you.

742
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:08,560
Is something wrong?

743
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,274
Last night, Rennie and I,
we decided to marry.

744
01:20:20,289 --> 01:20:23,705
I want you to be okay with this.

745
01:20:25,586 --> 01:20:27,875
I'll be okay.

746
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:03,320
I'll be out there in a minute.

747
01:21:09,755 --> 01:21:11,214
Woman in love.

748
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:17,712
- Do you really doubt it?
- No. I helped you get here, didn't I?

749
01:21:18,138 --> 01:21:21,139
When you put us together,
it made him want you more.

750
01:21:21,308 --> 01:21:24,641
So I guess you could say my
wedding gift was the groom.

751
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:29,563
I meant it as an exchange of gifts.

752
01:21:30,609 --> 01:21:33,942
Something you could take
with you from your time with Paul.

753
01:21:34,112 --> 01:21:37,980
Well, in that case, I still owe you one.

754
01:21:41,036 --> 01:21:44,156
- That was a beautiful ceremony.
- Thank you.

755
01:21:44,331 --> 01:21:46,822
It was a lovely ceremony.

756
01:21:47,751 --> 01:21:49,375
Open it.

757
01:21:51,046 --> 01:21:54,047
Whatever this is, it means a lot to me.

758
01:22:10,357 --> 01:22:12,645
Black widow.

759
01:22:14,194 --> 01:22:16,482
She mates and she kills.

760
01:22:19,407 --> 01:22:22,194
Your question is, does she love?

761
01:22:23,453 --> 01:22:26,656
It's impossible to answer that...

762
01:22:27,707 --> 01:22:29,783
...unless you live in her world.

763
01:22:36,049 --> 01:22:38,919
Such an intriguing gift.

764
01:22:44,557 --> 01:22:47,558
Makes me wish I had
more to share with you.

765
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:54,397
- Truth is, I'm sorry it's over.
- The truth is, it's not over yet.

766
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,190
Till then.

767
01:23:02,325 --> 01:23:06,737
With your permission, may I have
the pleasure to kiss the lovely bride?

768
01:23:31,812 --> 01:23:33,639
Come in.

769
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:41,478
Hey, Wisconsin, you knock.
I no recognize you.

770
01:23:41,947 --> 01:23:45,612
- Do you have my pictures?
- Sure.

771
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:51,118
Hey, I see you got married
a little while ago. Congratulations.

772
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,698
Good stuff, huh?

773
01:24:05,095 --> 01:24:08,927
What else do you have
in your desk, Mr. Shin?

774
01:24:09,099 --> 01:24:14,094
What do you mean by that? I got a lot
of stuff. I got paper clips. I got menthol.

775
01:24:14,271 --> 01:24:19,016
Condoms even, not it any your
business. Why you ask?

776
01:24:19,485 --> 01:24:23,399
Because you have a choice, Mr. Shin.
You can die or you can die happy.

777
01:24:23,614 --> 01:24:27,029
- Why are you doing this?
- It's in the second drawer. Look!

778
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,778
You have five seconds.

779
01:24:33,498 --> 01:24:35,325
- One...
- Please.

780
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:37,868
...two...
- Wait! Wait!

781
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:41,248
- Hold on.
...three...

782
01:24:48,054 --> 01:24:49,383
<i>... four.</i>

783
01:24:50,682 --> 01:24:53,351
Hyland, let me see that needle.

784
01:24:55,604 --> 01:24:57,976
Get it to the lab.

785
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:01,025
- Make sure they don't move anything.
- Okay.

786
01:25:05,989 --> 01:25:08,195
I want the whole room dusted.

787
01:25:08,366 --> 01:25:11,237
<i>Anything here for the Herald?
Or just a nothing OD?</i>

788
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:14,116
If it gets exciting,
I'll find your number.

789
01:25:17,709 --> 01:25:19,666
Now who would you be?

790
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,400
I'm glad you came over, Paul.
I need to talk to you.

791
01:25:49,574 --> 01:25:52,279
Don't you think Rennie
left a bit abruptly?

792
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:57,446
No. Just her usual trip. She sees
her accountant on the mainland.

793
01:25:57,623 --> 01:25:59,367
Investments.

794
01:26:02,378 --> 01:26:05,414
Paul, how well do you
think you know me?

795
01:26:05,798 --> 01:26:06,829
Know you?

796
01:26:10,219 --> 01:26:13,220
- A little bit, I guess.
- Would I ever lie to you?

797
01:26:13,431 --> 01:26:16,266
- I don't know.
- Well, I did.

798
01:26:16,892 --> 01:26:19,015
My name is not Jessica Bates.

799
01:26:19,186 --> 01:26:22,057
It's Alex Barnes.
I work for the Justice Department.

800
01:26:25,026 --> 01:26:27,695
Your wife's name
is not Rennie either.

801
01:26:27,862 --> 01:26:31,195
Only, no one seems to know
what her real name is.

802
01:26:31,365 --> 01:26:33,441
- Listen to me.
- This makes no sense.

803
01:26:33,617 --> 01:26:38,363
Under three different names, she married
three different men. All wealthy men.

804
01:26:38,581 --> 01:26:41,747
- What are you trying to do?
- Paul, she killed all of them.

805
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:47,042
She poisoned them. She's left town and
that's when they die, when she's gone.

806
01:26:51,302 --> 01:26:55,134
But she doesn't need my money.
I've seen her portfolio. Bank accounts...

807
01:26:55,306 --> 01:26:58,306
I just told you how she got them.

808
01:27:00,311 --> 01:27:03,679
- I know it sounds like I used you.
- Sounds like?

809
01:27:04,815 --> 01:27:07,306
You can't say that you
didn't know how I felt.

810
01:27:07,484 --> 01:27:11,399
That was Jessie, not some cop.

811
01:27:12,573 --> 01:27:18,077
Look, lady, don't feel so bad.
Everybody uses everybody.

812
01:27:20,164 --> 01:27:22,655
Only she does it better, right?

813
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:26,000
That's what it is, isn't it?
She does it better.

814
01:27:26,169 --> 01:27:29,835
- No, that isn't it.
- And I told myself you could handle it.

815
01:27:30,007 --> 01:27:33,422
- I did!
- Then maybe you can explain our wills.

816
01:27:33,593 --> 01:27:37,923
They leave everything...
Everything to the Cancer Foundation.

817
01:27:38,098 --> 01:27:41,798
Nothing to each other.
It was her idea.

818
01:27:41,977 --> 01:27:45,180
Sound like the woman
you're talking about?

819
01:27:46,064 --> 01:27:47,856
Answer me!

820
01:27:53,738 --> 01:27:56,775
Tell me there is no jealousy.

821
01:27:58,368 --> 01:28:00,859
No jealousy at all.

822
01:28:23,935 --> 01:28:27,434
They said he strangled
in his sleep or something.

823
01:28:30,984 --> 01:28:33,688
Do you know a woman named
Jessica Bates?

824
01:28:34,404 --> 01:28:36,361
I do.

825
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:40,825
It seems Miss Bates
is a federal agent named Barnes.

826
01:28:41,202 --> 01:28:45,947
And Miss Barnes believes
that you murdered Mr. Nuytten.

827
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,919
Paul died last night.

828
01:28:50,086 --> 01:28:53,786
I was in San Francisco.
You can call the hotel.

829
01:28:54,006 --> 01:28:55,916
She thinks you poisoned him.

830
01:28:56,092 --> 01:28:59,508
Something that would take delayed
effect while he slept.

831
01:29:04,725 --> 01:29:07,133
- Did you check our home for the poison?
- No.

832
01:29:07,353 --> 01:29:10,473
There's no probable cause for a warrant.

833
01:29:10,648 --> 01:29:14,811
- I thought you might voluntarily...
- Of course. Yes.

834
01:29:14,986 --> 01:29:17,144
Check everything you want.

835
01:29:19,782 --> 01:29:22,320
And while you're at it...

836
01:29:22,785 --> 01:29:27,281
...Jessica Bates,
or whatever her name is...

837
01:29:28,124 --> 01:29:32,951
...was my husband's lover.
Before and after the wedding.

838
01:29:34,046 --> 01:29:37,415
So while you're searching my home...

839
01:29:39,718 --> 01:29:41,094
Interesting.

840
01:29:41,262 --> 01:29:45,674
We learned that he went to her
apartment yesterday afternoon.

841
01:30:23,178 --> 01:30:25,337
Please, have a seat.

842
01:30:27,224 --> 01:30:29,596
You've been more than kind...

843
01:30:30,018 --> 01:30:32,688
...after what you've been through.

844
01:30:34,815 --> 01:30:38,349
Listen, we did find a toxic compound
in Miss Barnes' apartment.

845
01:30:39,736 --> 01:30:42,571
Delayed-action poison.

846
01:30:42,739 --> 01:30:45,147
Also, we have certain photographs.

847
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,950
Photos of Miss Barnes
and your husband.

848
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:57,585
Those pictures are all my fault. I...

849
01:30:59,381 --> 01:31:02,880
I hired this horrid little man.

850
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:05,511
How did you get them?

851
01:31:06,054 --> 01:31:08,627
The man you hired
is dead, Mrs. Nuytten.

852
01:31:08,807 --> 01:31:12,306
We assumed of an accidental
overdose of heroin.

853
01:31:13,228 --> 01:31:17,557
Now I'm afraid Miss Barnes has more
than just your husband to answer for.

854
01:31:21,694 --> 01:31:23,438
How well did you know him?

855
01:31:26,366 --> 01:31:28,655
Back as far as you can.

856
01:31:30,662 --> 01:31:33,828
Did you know Paul Nuytten?
Were you having a love affair?

857
01:31:34,707 --> 01:31:39,702
Mrs. Nuytten, the Cancer Foundation
flew Mr. Foster to the islands...

858
01:31:39,879 --> 01:31:43,544
...because we seem to have...
Well, something of a situation.

859
01:31:43,716 --> 01:31:48,094
- A situation?
- Yes, it's concerning Mr. Nuytten's will.

860
01:31:48,262 --> 01:31:52,556
It seems that Mr. Nuytten's legal
residence is the state of Florida.

861
01:31:52,725 --> 01:31:54,552
Were you aware of that?

862
01:31:54,727 --> 01:31:56,269
No. Should I be?

863
01:31:56,729 --> 01:32:01,438
Florida has a so-called mortmain
statute, Mrs. Nuytten.

864
01:32:01,818 --> 01:32:06,942
Any bequest to charity in a will
executed within six months of death...

865
01:32:07,114 --> 01:32:09,321
...can be invalidated by the spouse.

866
01:32:12,537 --> 01:32:14,613
- How interesting.
Of course...

867
01:32:14,789 --> 01:32:18,240
...it's no requirement
that you invalidate the gift.

868
01:32:19,418 --> 01:32:24,127
Shortly before his death,
Mr. Foster, my husband...

869
01:32:24,298 --> 01:32:27,833
...expressed reservations
about your organization.

870
01:32:30,137 --> 01:32:33,423
Profound reservations.

871
01:32:43,192 --> 01:32:47,521
Miss Barnes called from the jail.

872
01:32:49,365 --> 01:32:54,525
I tell her you plan to take long trip.

873
01:33:54,805 --> 01:33:57,130
Treating you...?

874
01:33:58,350 --> 01:33:59,725
You okay?

875
01:34:01,645 --> 01:34:03,933
I can't complain.

876
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:08,561
It's a lot of psychological tests.

877
01:34:09,361 --> 01:34:12,196
Which I find surprising
for a crime of passion.

878
01:34:15,325 --> 01:34:18,030
Not so surprising.

879
01:34:19,204 --> 01:34:23,616
Well, they don't seem to think
your only motive was jealousy.

880
01:34:25,543 --> 01:34:27,335
Not of Paul, anyway.

881
01:34:28,213 --> 01:34:31,961
They seem to think
your obsession was...

882
01:34:33,426 --> 01:34:34,920
...with me.

883
01:34:35,637 --> 01:34:38,970
They think you started out as
an ambitious federal agent...

884
01:34:41,017 --> 01:34:44,386
...and you became obsessed by this...

885
01:34:45,438 --> 01:34:47,431
...phantom.

886
01:34:48,107 --> 01:34:50,183
And then...

887
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,853
...you chased her...

888
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:55,357
...and you chased her...

889
01:34:56,949 --> 01:35:01,077
...and when you thought you'd
never be quick enough to catch her...

890
01:35:01,245 --> 01:35:03,072
I killed him...

891
01:35:03,456 --> 01:35:05,448
...to frame you.

892
01:35:32,818 --> 01:35:34,941
How did you manage it?

893
01:35:35,112 --> 01:35:38,066
What, did you leave town
and sneak back?

894
01:35:39,450 --> 01:35:42,901
Did you use the same bottle
you put in my place?

895
01:35:43,078 --> 01:35:47,372
You always did have a tendency
to over-think things.

896
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:52,911
The most important thing about figuring
anything out is knowing when to stop.

897
01:35:59,803 --> 01:36:01,843
You know...

898
01:36:03,349 --> 01:36:07,216
...of all the relationships
I'll look back on...

899
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,636
...in 50 years' time...

900
01:36:13,817 --> 01:36:17,566
...I'll always remember this one.

901
01:36:36,965 --> 01:36:38,673
Hello, Sara.

902
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,012
It's good to see you.

903
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:14,916
I put the poison in Paul's brandy.
You mustn't...

904
01:37:15,086 --> 01:37:17,412
We know. We found it before he did.

905
01:38:26,615 --> 01:38:28,359
Get your cameras, she's here!

906
01:38:28,534 --> 01:38:33,279
Congratulations, that was a brilliant trap.
Are you going back to Washington now?

907
01:38:33,456 --> 01:38:35,781
Were you tipped off
she was here in Hawaii?

908
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:37,951
Please, give us an answer for the press.

909
01:38:38,127 --> 01:38:41,081
Are you going to testify at the trial?

910
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:46,840
I will give you the statement.
