1
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,030
<i>Drink up, me hearfies, yo ho</i>

2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,661
<i>We kidnap and ravage</i>
<i>and don't give a hoot</i>

3
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,620
<i>Drink up, me hearfies, yo ho</i>

4
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,710
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,760
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

6
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,720
<i>We extorf, we pilfer</i>
<i>We filch, we sack...</i>

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,470
Quiet, missy!
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

8
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,850
You don't want to bring
them down on us.

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,850
Mr Gibbs, that will do.

10
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,650
She was singing about pirates!

11
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,780
Bad luck to sing about pirates
with us mired in this unnatural fog.

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,240
- Mark my words.
- Consider them marked.

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,490
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

14
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,540
Bad luck to have a woman on board,
too. Even a miniature one.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,580
It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.

16
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,210
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile creatures, the lot of them.

17
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,680
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,760
gets what he deserves.

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,520
A short drop and a sudden stop.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,900
I appreciate your fervour,

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,860
but I'm concerned about the effect this
subject will have upon my daughter.

22
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,700
My apologies, Governor Swann.

23
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,820
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- That's what concerns me.

24
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,650
There's a boy in the water!

25
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,940
Man overboard!

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,240
Man the ropes! Fetch a hook!
Haul him aboard!

27
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,710
He's still breathing.

28
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,040
Mary, Mother of God!

29
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,180
What happened here?

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,390
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

31
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,610
Lot of good it did them.
Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.

32
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,530
Pirates!

33
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,650
There's no proof of that!
It was probably an accident.

34
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,040
Rouse the captain. Heave to
and take in sail. Launch the boats.

35
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,870
Elizabeth, accompany the boy.

36
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,790
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,090
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.

38
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,900
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.

39
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,700
Will Turner.

40
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm watching over you, Will.

41
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,550
You're a pirate!

42
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,420
Has he said anything?

43
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,510
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.

44
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,510
Take him below.

45
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,710
Elizabeth!

46
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,590
Are you all right?

47
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,880
Are you decent?

48
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,130
Yes.

49
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,140
Yes?

50
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,100
Still abed at this hour?

51
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,980
It's a beautiful day.

52
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,020
I have a gift for you.

53
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,570
- It's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

54
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,410
May I inquire as to the occasion?

55
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,330
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

56
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,830
Go on.

57
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,380
Actually... I had hoped you might
wear it for the ceremony today.

58
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,710
The ceremony?

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,550
Captain Norrington's
promotion ceremony.

60
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,760
I knew it!

61
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,800
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

62
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,100
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.

63
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,980
Elizabeth? How's it coming?

64
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,780
- It's difficult to say.
- It's the latest fashion in London.

65
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,610
Women in London
must've learned not to breathe!

66
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,780
My Lord, you have a visitor.

67
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,140
Mr Turner! Good to see you again.

68
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,810
Good day, sir. I have your order.

69
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,690
The blade is folded steel. That's
gold filigree laid into the handle.

70
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,280
If I may?

71
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,240
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

72
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,410
Perfectly balanced. The tang
is nearly the width of the blade.

73
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,500
Impressive. Very impressive.

74
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,630
Commodore Norrington's
going to be very pleased with this.

75
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,880
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

76
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,720
I shall.

77
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,350
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

78
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,810
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning!

79
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,820
Will! It's so good to see you!

80
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,070
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

81
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,120
- Elizabeth, is that proper...?
- About the day we met. Remember?

82
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,290
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

83
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,710
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

84
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,040
At least once more, Miss Swann.
As always.

85
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,880
There. See? At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

86
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,170
We really must be going.

87
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,760
Good day, Mr Turner.

88
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,350
Come along!

89
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,430
Good day...

90
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,400
Elizabeth.

91
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,450
Hold up there, you!

92
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,870
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

93
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,330
I need to know your name.

94
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,840
What do you say to three shillings
and we forget the name?

95
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,090
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr Smith.

96
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,590
Two paces... march!

97
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,180
Right about... face!

98
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,430
Present... arms!

99
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,120
This dock is off limits to civilians.

100
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,500
This dock is off limits to civilians.

101
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,050
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.

102
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,350
There's some high-toned
and fancy to-do at the fort.

103
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,520
How could it be that two upstanding
gentlemen did not merit an invitation?

104
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,520
We have to make sure this dock
stays off limits to civilians.

105
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:17,570
It's a fine goal, to be sure,
but it seems to me, a ship like that

106
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,240
makes this one here
a bit superfluous.

107
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,410
The Dauntless is the power
in these waters,

108
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,410
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

109
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,330
I've heard of one. It's supposed
to be fast, nigh uncatchable.

110
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,590
The Black Pearl.

111
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,470
There's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor.

112
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,640
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

113
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,720
- No, it's not.
- It is. I've seen it!

114
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,640
- You've seen it?
- Yes.

115
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,810
- You haven't seen it!
- Yes, I have!

116
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,110
You've seen a ship with black sails,
that's crewed by the damned

117
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,410
and captained by a man so evil
that Hell itself spat him back out?

118
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,870
- No.
- No.

119
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,870
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

120
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,370
No ship not crewed by the damned

121
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
and captained by a man so evil,
Hell spat him back out,

122
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,960
could have black sails, so couldn't be
any other ship than The Black Pearl.

123
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,590
Is that what you're saying?

124
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
No.

125
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,470
Like I said, there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

126
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,020
You! Get away from there!
You don't have permission to be aboard!

127
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,900
I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty
boat. Ship!

128
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,490
- What's your name?
- Smith! Or Smithy, if you like.

129
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,870
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
'Mr Smith'?

130
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,540
- And no lies!
- All right. I confess.

131
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,330
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

132
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,750
I intend to commandeer a ship,
pick up a crew in Tortuga,

133
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,710
rape, pillage and otherwise
pilfer my black guts out.

134
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,760
- I said no lies!
- I think he's telling the truth.

135
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,140
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

136
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,220
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth even if he told you.

137
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,320
May I have a moment?

138
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,540
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

139
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,840
I apologise if I seem forward,
but I must speak my mind.

140
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,720
This promotion throws into sharp relief
that which I have not yet achieved.

141
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,480
A marriage to a fine woman.

142
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,230
You have become a fine woman.

143
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,780
I can't breathe!

144
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,650
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

145
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,740
Then they made me their chief.

146
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,830
Elizabeth?

147
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,790
Elizabeth!

148
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,300
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

149
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,260
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim!

150
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,970
Pride of the King's Navy, you are!
Do not lose these.

151
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,030
What was that?

152
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,530
I got her!

153
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,490
- She's not breathing!
- Move!

154
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,130
- I never would've thought of that.
- You've never been to Singapore.

155
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,930
Where did you get that?

156
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,560
On your feet.

157
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,190
Elizabeth!

158
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,400
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

159
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,280
- Shoot him!
- Father!

160
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,280
Commodore, do you intend
to kill my rescuer?

161
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,250
I believe thanks are in order.

162
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,970
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, pirate?

163
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,640
Hang him!

164
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,600
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

165
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,890
Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

166
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,270
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

167
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,360
I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.

168
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,860
I'm in the market, as it were.

169
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,240
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

170
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,450
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his.

171
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,460
No additional shot nor powder.

172
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,170
A compass that doesn't point north.

173
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,470
I half expected it to be made from wood.

174
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,970
You are without doubt
the worst pirate I've ever heard of!

175
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,310
But you have heard of me.

176
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,480
Commodore, I must protest!

177
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,650
Carefully, Lieutenant.

178
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,940
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

179
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,950
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man for his wickedness!

180
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,780
- It seems enough to condemn him.
- Indeed.

181
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,740
Finally.

182
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,290
- Don't shoot!
- I knew you'd warm up to me.

183
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,500
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please. And my hat.

184
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,500
Commodore.

185
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,430
- Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?
- It's Miss Swann.

186
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,770
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

187
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,190
If you'll be very kind.

188
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,910
Easy on the goods, darling.

189
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,830
- You're despicable.
- Sticks and stones, love.

190
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,750
I saved your life, you saved mine.
We're square.

191
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,470
Gentlemen, my lady,

192
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,840
you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

193
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,390
Captain Jack Sparrow!

194
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,200
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

195
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,540
On his heels!

196
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,940
Take cover, man!

197
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,770
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has
a dawn appointment with the gallows.

198
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,070
I would hate for him to miss it.

199
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,740
Search up the stairs!

200
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,490
Look lively, men!

201
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,840
Right where I left you.

202
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,470
Not where I left you.

203
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,030
You're the one they're hunting.

204
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,450
The pirate!

205
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,660
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

206
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,530
I avoid familiarity with pirates.

207
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,120
It would be a shame to put a black
mark on your record. Excuse me.

208
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,550
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?

209
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,140
You threatened Miss Swann.

210
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,100
Only a little.

211
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,950
You know what you're doing.
Excellent form. How's your footwork?

212
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,160
If I step here...

213
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,870
Good.

214
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,040
And now I step again.

215
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,880
Ta.

216
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,240
That is a wonderful trick.

217
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,570
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

218
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
And now...
you have no weapon.

219
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,680
Who makes all these?

220
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,480
I do.

221
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,440
And I practice with them
three hours a day.

222
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,440
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

223
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,040
Or, the reason you practice three hours
a day is that you already found one

224
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,750
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

225
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,340
You're not a eunuch, are you?

226
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,800
I practice three hours a day
so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!

227
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,340
- You cheated!
- Pirate.

228
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,930
- Move away!
- No.

229
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,390
Please?

230
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,270
No! I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

231
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,850
This shot is not meant for you.

232
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,200
There he is! Over here!

233
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:05,120
Excellent work, Mr Brown. You've
assisted in the capture of a fugitive.

234
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,500
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

235
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:14,550
I trust you will remember this as the
day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

236
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,180
Take him away.

237
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,730
- Come here, boy. Come here.
- Who wants a juicy bone?

238
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,110
Come here, boy!

239
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,110
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.

240
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,320
Excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

241
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,420
There you go, miss. It was
a difficult day for you, I'm sure.

242
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,670
I suspected Commodore Norrington would
propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.

243
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,930
I meant you being threatened
by that pirate! Sounds terrifying!

244
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,310
Yes, it was terrifying.

245
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,600
But... the Commodore proposed!
Fancy that.

246
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,480
That's a smart match, miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

247
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,980
It is a smart match.

248
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,900
He's a fine man.

249
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,660
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

250
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,120
That Will Turner...
he's a fine man, too.

251
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,000
That is too bold.

252
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,870
Beggin' your pardon.
It was not my place.

253
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,720
Has my daughter
given you an answer yet?

254
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,430
No, she hasn't.

255
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,850
She has had a trying day.

256
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,640
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Really bleak.

257
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,110
What's that?

258
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,400
Cannon fire!

259
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,650
Return fire!

260
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,070
I know those guns.

261
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,790
It's the Pearl.

262
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,870
The Black Pearl?

263
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,630
I've heard stories.

264
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,710
She's been preying on ships
and settlements for ten years.

265
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,880
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

266
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

267
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,960
Mama!

268
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,320
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes!

269
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,780
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr Stevens, more cartridges.

270
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,990
Governor. Barricade yourself
in my office.

271
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,450
That's an order.

272
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,560
Don't!

273
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,020
Hello, chum.

274
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,940
Up there!

275
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,490
Miss Swann,
they've come to kidnap you.

276
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,120
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

277
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,120
In here!

278
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,210
They haven't seen you.
First chance you get, run to the fort.

279
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,850
Gotcha!

280
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,350
No! It's hot. I'm burning!

281
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,520
Come on!

282
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,150
Come on, me men.

283
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,610
We know you're here, poppet.

284
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,370
- Poppet!
- Come out.

285
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,030
We promise we won't hurt you.

286
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,790
We will find you, poppet.

287
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,590
You've got something of ours
and it calls to us.

288
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,760
The gold calls to us.

289
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,220
The gold.

290
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,230
Hello, poppet.

291
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,980
Parley.

292
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:30,440
- What?
- I invoke the right of parley.

293
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,950
The Code of the Brethren states
you have to take me to your captain.

294
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,660
I know the Code.

295
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,620
You can do me no harm
until the parley is complete.

296
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,330
- To blazes with the Code.
- She wants to be taken to the Captain.

297
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,090
And she'll go, without a fuss.

298
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,220
We must honour the Code.

299
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,850
Say goodbye!

300
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,190
Goodbye.

301
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,950
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.

302
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,750
Out of my way, scum!

303
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,770
My sympathies. You've no manner
of luck at all.

304
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,460
Come on, doggy! It's just
you and me now.

305
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:15,920
It's you and old Jack. Come on.
That's a boy! Get your bone!

306
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,590
That's a good boy.
A bit closer!

307
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,010
That's it, doggy!

308
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,430
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy character!

309
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,150
No! I didn't mean it!

310
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,240
This ain't the armoury!

311
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,580
Well, well, well. Look what we have
here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow!

312
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,920
Last time I saw you,

313
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:56,630
you were all alone on a godforsaken
island, shrinking into the distance.

314
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,470
His fortunes aren't improved much.

315
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,970
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

316
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,730
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers.

317
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,020
So there is a curse.

318
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,400
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of Hell.

319
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,620
That's very interesting.

320
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,370
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

321
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,750
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

322
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,460
- I am here to...
- You will speak when spoken to.

323
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,510
And ye will not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley.

324
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,510
Aye, sir.

325
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,430
My apologies, miss.

326
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,310
Captain Barbossa... I am here to
negotiate the cessation of hostilities.

327
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,780
There are a lot of long words there.
We're naught but humble pirates.

328
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:43,700
- What is it you want?
- Leave and never come back.

329
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:49,870
I'm disinclined to acquiesce
to your request.

330
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,460
Means "no."

331
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,130
Very well.

332
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,550
I'll drop it.

333
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,260
Me holds are burstin' with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?

334
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,390
Why?

335
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,390
It's what you've been searching for.
I recognise the ship.

336
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,400
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

337
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,570
Did you now?

338
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:27,370
Fine. I suppose if it is worthless
there's no point in me keeping it.

339
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,160
No!

340
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,500
You have a name, missy?

341
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:48,300
Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid
in the Governor's household.

342
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,600
Miss Turner!

343
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,020
- Turner!
- Bootstrap!

344
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,200
How does a maid come to own
that trinket? Family heirloom?

345
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,160
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

346
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,660
You hand it over
and we'll leave and never return.

347
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,640
Our bargain?

348
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,640
Still the guns and stow them. Signal
the men and make good to clear port.

349
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,560
You have to take me to shore.
According to the Code...

350
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,320
First...

351
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,570
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiations so I must do nothing.

352
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,820
Secondly, you must be a pirate for the
Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.

353
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:56,330
Thirdly, the code is more what
you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

354
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,870
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

355
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,060
They've taken Elizabeth!

356
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,980
Mr Murtogg, remove this man.

357
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,110
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.

358
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,700
Where do you propose we start?

359
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,330
If you have any information
concerning my daughter, share it.

360
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,670
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

361
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,750
Mentioned it is more what he did.

362
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:48,300
Ask him where it is!
He could lead us to it.

363
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,090
No.

364
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:56,100
The pirates left Sparrow in his cell,
ergo they are not his allies.

365
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,560
We will establish their
most likely course...

366
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,020
That's not good enough!

367
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:09,320
Mr Turner, you are not a military man
or a sailor. You are a blacksmith.

368
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,370
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

369
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:20,410
Do not think you are the only man here
who cares for Elizabeth.

370
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,630
Please.

371
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,550
- You! Sparrow!
- Aye?

372
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,640
You are familiar with
the Black Pearl?

373
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,100
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

374
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:43,350
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

375
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:51,490
Captain Barbossa and his crew of
miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.

376
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:57,580
It's an island that cannot be found,
except by those who know where it is.

377
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,870
The ship's real, therefore its anchorage
must be a real place. Where?

378
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,170
- Why ask me?
- Because you're a pirate.

379
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,920
You want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

380
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,380
Never!

381
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,510
- They took Miss Swann.
- So it is that you found a girl!

382
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,470
I see!

383
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,690
If you intend to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

384
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:29,110
and so, win fair lady's heart,
you'll have to do it alone, mate.

385
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,190
I see no profit in it for me.

386
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,110
- I can get you out of here.
- The key's run off.

387
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:39,780
I helped build these cells.
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

388
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,750
With leverage and the proper application
of strength, the door will lift free.

389
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,550
- What's your name?
- Will Turner.

390
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,430
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good, strong name.

391
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,430
No doubt named for your father.

392
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,180
Yes.

393
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,230
Mr Turner, I've changed me mind.

394
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,320
If you spring me from here,
I swear, on pain of death,

395
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,320
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,
and your bonny lass.

396
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:18,990
Do we have an accord?

397
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,960
- Agreed.
- Agreed! Get me out!

398
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,000
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

399
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,720
We're going to steal a ship?

400
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,770
- That ship?
- Commandeer.

401
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,270
We're going to "commandeer" that ship.
Nautical term.

402
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:52,860
One question about your business,
or there's no use going.

403
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,820
This girl, how far are you willing to go
to save her?

404
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:01,660
- I'd die for her.
- Good. No worries then.

405
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,180
This is either madness or brilliance.

406
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,640
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

407
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,180
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

408
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,300
Aye! Avast!

409
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:11,190
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You'll never make it out of the bay.

410
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,320
Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

411
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,400
Savvy?

412
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:25,200
- Commodore!
- They're taking the Dauntless!

413
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,750
Commodore! They've taken the ship!

414
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,130
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

415
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,250
Rash, Turner. Too rash.

416
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,050
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.

417
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,560
Here they come.

418
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,730
Bring her around!

419
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,280
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

420
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,170
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!

421
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:33,140
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

422
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,850
We'd have had
a hard time by ourselves.

423
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,400
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

424
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,860
With this wind we won't catch them.

425
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:47,120
I don't need to. Get them in range
of the long nines.

426
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,330
Run out the guns!

427
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,000
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

428
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:58,080
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

429
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,670
Commodore!
He's disabled the rudder chain.

430
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,390
Abandon ship!

431
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:17,060
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

432
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,860
So it would seem.

433
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,410
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

434
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,410
After she died, I came here,
looking for my father.

435
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Is that so?

436
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,800
My father, Bill Turner?

437
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,880
It was only after you learned my name
you agreed to help.

438
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,760
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

439
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:53,350
I'm not a simpleton.
You knew my father.

440
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,940
I knew him. Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

441
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,150
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap".

442
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,160
Bootstrap?

443
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,700
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.

444
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:19,000
It's not true. He was a merchant sailor.
A respectable man who obeyed the law.

445
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,290
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

446
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,510
My father was not a pirate!

447
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,510
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.

448
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,100
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

449
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,180
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

450
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,740
As long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

451
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,620
The only rules that matter are these:

452
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,160
what a man can do
and what a man can't do.

453
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:01,370
You can accept your father was a
pirate and a good man, or you can't.

454
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,800
Pirate is in your blood, so you'll
have to square with that someday.

455
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,420
Me, for example,
I can let you drown,

456
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:13,010
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies, savvy?

457
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,890
So.

458
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,270
Can you sail under the command
of a pirate?

459
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,570
Or can you not?

460
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,320
Tortuga?

461
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,860
Tortuga.

462
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,810
It is a sad life
that has never breathed deep

463
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:00,270
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

464
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,850
What do you think?

465
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,150
- It'll linger.
- I'll tell you, mate,

466
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:16,070
if every town were like this one,
no man would ever feel unwanted.

467
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:19,040
Scarlett!

468
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,290
Not sure I deserved that.

469
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,290
Not sure I deserved that.

470
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:23,710
Giselle.

471
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,500
Giselle.

472
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,290
- Who was she?
- What?

473
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,960
I may have deserved that.

474
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,390
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

475
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,970
Mother's love!

476
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,770
Jack!

477
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,190
You should know not to wake a man
when he's sleepin'.

478
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,150
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

479
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,400
The man who did the waking
buys the man who was sleeping a drink.

480
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:57,620
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to his proposition.

481
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,750
Aye, that'll about do it.

482
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,750
Blast! I'm already awake!

483
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,250
That was for the smell.

484
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,970
Keep a sharp eye.

485
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,440
Now, what's the nature
of this venture of your'n?

486
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,860
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

487
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,950
I know where it's going to be,
and I'm gonna take it.

488
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,380
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

489
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,750
You know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

490
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,880
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

491
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,220
All I need is a crew.

492
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:02,180
Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer
fools nor strike a bargain with one.

493
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,520
It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.

494
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,650
Prove me wrong. What makes you think
Barbossa will give up his ship to you?

495
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:13,070
Let's just say it's a matter
of leverage.

496
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:31,330
The kid?

497
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,920
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

498
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,470
His only child. Savvy?

499
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,140
Is he now?

500
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,810
Leverage, says you.

501
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,940
I feel a change in the wind, says I.

502
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:53,230
I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be
some sailors on this rock crazy as you.

503
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,690
One can only hope.

504
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,860
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

505
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,570
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

506
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:27,560
You'll be dining with the captain,
and he requests you wear this.

507
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,100
Tell him that I am disinclined
to acquiesce to his request.

508
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,480
He said you'd say that.

509
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:40,030
He also said if that be the case,
you'll be dining with the crew.

510
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,110
And you'll be naked.

511
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,250
Fine.

512
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,560
There's no need to stand on ceremony,
no call to impress anyone.

513
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,100
You must be hungry.

514
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,410
Try the wine.

515
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,500
And the apples. One of those next.

516
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,310
It's poisoned.

517
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,180
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

518
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,400
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

519
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,450
You don't know what this is, do you?

520
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,530
It's a pirate medallion.

521
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,700
This is Aztec gold.

522
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:14,790
One of 882 identical pieces they
delivered in a stone chest to Cortés.

523
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:19,880
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

524
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,090
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

525
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:24,220
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

526
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,970
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

527
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,390
a terrible curse.

528
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:38,310
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

529
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,400
shall be punished for eternity.

530
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:41,780
shall be punished for eternity.

531
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,610
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

532
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,820
Aye.

533
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,160
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

534
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:55,250
Buried on an island of the dead
what cannot be found,

535
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,960
except for those who know where it is.

536
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,790
Find it, we did.

537
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,920
There be the chest.
Inside be the gold.

538
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,130
And we took 'em all!

539
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,510
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

540
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,720
and frittered 'em away on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

541
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:20,310
The more we gave 'em away,
the more we came to realise...

542
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,480
the drink would not satisfy.

543
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,150
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

544
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,240
Food turned to ash in our mouths,

545
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,990
and all the pleasurable company
in the world could not slake our lust.

546
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,910
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

547
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,290
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

548
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,840
we are consumed by it.

549
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,310
There is one way we can end our curse.

550
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:07,740
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold must be restored,

551
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,820
and the blood repaid.

552
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,410
Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.

553
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,620
And the blood to be repaid?

554
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,290
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you.

555
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,340
Yet.

556
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,670
Apple?

557
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:49,530
I'm curious. After killing me,
what are you planning on doing next?

558
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,220
Look!

559
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,470
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

560
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:02,230
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

561
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,390
But neither are we dead.

562
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,320
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

563
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,320
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

564
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,400
Too long I've been starvin' to death
and haven't died.

565
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:16,620
I feel nothing.

566
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,620
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

567
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,540
nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

568
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:28,710
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

569
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,710
You're in one!

570
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,980
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

571
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:54,110
You heard the captain.
Back to work.

572
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:04,540
Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

573
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,710
Every man worth his salt,

574
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,790
and crazy to boot.

575
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,880
So this is your able-bodied crew?

576
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,140
- You, sailor!
- Cotton, sir.

577
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,720
Mr Cotton, do you have the courage
and fortitude to follow orders

578
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,850
and stay true in the face of danger
and almost certain death?

579
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,440
- Mr Cotton. Answer, man!
- He's a mute, sir.

580
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:36,780
Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so
he trained the parrot to talk for him.

581
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,910
No one's yet figured how.

582
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:45,540
Mr Cotton's parrot,
same question.

583
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:49,120
Wind in your sails!
Wind in your sails!

584
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,040
Mostly, we figure that means "yes".

585
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,380
Of course it does. Satisfied?

586
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,340
Well, you've proved they're mad.

587
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:59,800
What's the benefit for us?

588
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,940
Anamaria!

589
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,280
- I suppose you didn't deserve that.
- No, that one I deserved.

590
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,240
- You stole my boat!
- Actually...

591
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:27,410
Borrowed without permission, but with
every intention of bringing it back.

592
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,290
- But you didn't!
- You'll get another one.

593
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,040
- I will.
- A better one.

594
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,960
A better one!

595
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,340
- That one.
- What one?

596
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,840
That one?

597
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,600
Aye. That one.

598
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,220
- What say you?
- Aye!

599
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:49,680
Aye!

600
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:51,770
Anchor's aweigh!

601
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,980
No, it's frightful bad luck
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

602
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:58,360
It'll be far worse not to have her.

603
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:35,560
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

604
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,860
with a compass that doesn't work?

605
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,700
The compass doesn't point north, but
we're not trying to find north, are we?

606
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:55,790
We should drop canvas, sir.

607
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,920
She can hold a bit longer.

608
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:03,760
What's in your head as puts you
in such a fine mood, Cap'n?

609
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,510
We're catching up.

610
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,610
Time to go, poppet.

611
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:22,670
Dead men tell no tales.

612
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:29,800
Chills the bones, how many honest
sailors been claimed by this passage.

613
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,610
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

614
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,780
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
before he came to Tortuga

615
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:53,620
with a mind to find the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

616
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:57,080
That was before I'd met him, when he
was captain of the Black Pearl.

617
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
What?

618
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:06,670
- He failed to mention that.
- He plays things close to the vest now.

619
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,970
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

620
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,560
Three days into the trip, the first mate
says, "Everything's an equal share."

621
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,390
"The location of the treasure, too."
So Jack gives up the bearings.

622
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,770
That night, there was a mutiny.

623
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,940
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

624
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:28,360
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

625
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,530
So that's the reason for all the...

626
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:38,370
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

627
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,920
When a pirate's marooned, he's given
a pistol with a single shot. One shot.

628
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,880
That won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

629
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:50,630
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

630
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,720
that pistol looks real friendly.

631
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:57,100
But Jack escaped the island,
and still has that single shot.

632
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,730
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

633
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,850
His mutinous first mate.

634
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,940
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

635
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:09,530
- How did Jack get off the island?
- I'll tell ye.

636
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:13,950
He waded out into the shallows,
and waited three days and three nights,

637
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:18,790
till all manner of sea creatures
became acclimated to his presence.

638
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:22,710
On the fourth morning,
he roped a couple of sea turtles,

639
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,170
lashed them together
and made a raft.

640
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,670
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

641
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:35,260
What did he use for rope?

642
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,770
Human hair.

643
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:45,360
From my back.

644
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,900
- Let go the anchor!
- Lower the anchor line!

645
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:51,360
Young Mr Turner and I are to go ashore.

646
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,150
Captain.

647
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,780
What if the worst should happen?

648
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:59,160
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye. The Code.

649
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,070
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- Now we finally get to spend it.

650
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,990
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

651
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:44,410
and you can buy an eye
that fits and is made of glass.

652
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,460
This one does splinter
something terrible.

653
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,500
Stop rubbing it.

654
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,440
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

655
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:14,820
Pirates' Code.

656
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,740
Any man who falls behind
is left behind.

657
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,370
No heroes amongst thieves.

658
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:26,000
For having such a bleak outlook
on pirates

659
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:28,540
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

660
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,460
Sprung a man from jail,

661
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:34,970
commandeered a ship of the fleet,

662
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:37,800
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

663
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,850
and you're completely obsessed
with treasure.

664
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:49,400
That's not true. I am not obsessed
with treasure.

665
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,360
Not all treasure is silver
and gold, mate.

666
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:02,490
Gentlemen, the time has come!

667
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:05,160
Salvation is nigh!

668
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:09,750
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

669
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,380
For ten years
we've been tested and tried

670
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:17,720
and each man here has proved his mettle
a hundred times over

671
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,140
and a hundred times again!

672
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,430
Suffered, I have!

673
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:31,060
Punished we were, the lot of us,
disproportionate to our crime!

674
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,690
Here it is!

675
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:41,530
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

676
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:47,870
Every last piece that went astray,
we have returned.

677
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,250
Save for this!

678
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:53,210
- Jack!
- Not yet.

679
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,170
We wait for the opportune moment.

680
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:03,970
When's that? When it's of greatest
profit to you?

681
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,680
May I ask you something?

682
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:09,270
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

683
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:15,730
Do us a favour. I know it's difficult
for you, but please stay here.

684
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,150
And try not to do anything stupid.

685
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,330
Who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

686
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:29,120
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet be paid?

687
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,870
Hers!

688
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,670
You know the first thing I'm going to do
after the curse is lifted?

689
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:43,340
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

690
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,190
Begun by blood.

691
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,270
By blood undone.

692
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:03,280
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not going to be your leverage.

693
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,920
That's it?

694
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,500
Waste not.

695
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,710
Did it work?

696
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,710
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

697
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,350
You're not dead!

698
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:09,970
No.

699
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,890
- He shot me.
- It didn't work.

700
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,520
The curse is still upon us!

701
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:23,490
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

702
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,820
Was your father William Turner?

703
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,610
No.

704
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:31,030
Where's his child who sailed
from England eight years ago?

705
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,750
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner? Where?

706
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,170
You two!
You brought us the wrong person!

707
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:48,800
No!

708
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:51,720
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.

709
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,930
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.

710
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,560
I think she lied to us.

711
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,320
You brought us here for nothing.

712
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,490
I won't take questioning,
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

713
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:10,820
Who's to blame him? Your decisions
have led us from bad to worse!

714
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,620
It was you who sent Bootstrap
to the depths!

715
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,130
And it's you who brought us here
in the first place!

716
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:28,050
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

717
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,510
I say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood. Just in case.

718
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,060
Yeah!

719
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:46,650
The medallion! She's taken it!

720
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:50,530
Get after her, you feckless pack
of ingrates!

721
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:59,250
- Where are the oars?
- There's no oars!

722
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:02,210
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

723
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,800
You!

724
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:17,350
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Am I not?

725
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:29,610
Pearlie...

726
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,530
Palu-li-la-la-lulu...

727
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,080
Parlili...

728
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,700
Parsnip... Parsley...

729
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,040
Partner...

730
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,670
- Parley?
- That's the one! Parley!

731
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,380
Parley!

732
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,380
Parley?

733
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:52,840
Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead
thought of parley!

734
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:56,220
That would be the French.

735
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:11,530
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

736
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:13,990
Mr Gibbs?

737
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,120
Hey, boy, where be Jack?

738
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,700
Jack Sparrow?

739
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,500
He fell behind.

740
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:32,800
Keep to the Code.

741
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,640
Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails!

742
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,720
Split-quick, you dibbies!

743
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,520
How the blazes did you get
off that island?

744
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:51,480
When you marooned me
on that godforsaken spit of land,

745
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,950
you forgot one very important thing.

746
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,870
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

747
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:02,750
Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

748
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:07,250
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

749
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,000
Aye.

750
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,170
Kill him.

751
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:14,720
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

752
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,600
Hold your fire!

753
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,940
You know whose blood we need.

754
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,400
I know whose blood you need.

755
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,240
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

756
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:42,330
A pirate.

757
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:45,870
Here. Let me.

758
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,960
Thank you.

759
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:52,300
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

760
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,550
Why?

761
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,640
I don't know.

762
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,140
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

763
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:07,770
- They're rough.
- No. I mean, yes, they are, but...

764
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,190
Don't stop.

765
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,990
Elizabeth.

766
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:39,930
It's yours.

767
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,060
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

768
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:50,600
It was a gift from my father.
He sent it to me.

769
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,900
Why did you take it?

770
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,700
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

771
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:06,490
That would've been awful.

772
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:12,960
It wasn't your blood they needed.

773
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,380
It was my father's blood.

774
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,430
My blood.

775
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,940
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

776
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,450
So you expect to leave me on some beach

777
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,540
with nothing but a name
and your word it's the one I need,

778
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:52,330
and watch you
sail away in my ship.

779
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:53,580
No.

780
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:57,800
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

781
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,930
watching me sail away on my ship, and
then I'll shout the name back to you.

782
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,260
Savvy?

783
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:07,100
But that still leaves me
standing on some beach,

784
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:11,310
with naught but a name and
your word it's the one I need.

785
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:17,610
Of the two of us, I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

786
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:21,650
Therefore, my word
is the one we'll be trusting.

787
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:26,280
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because, in fact,

788
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:29,490
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

789
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:34,290
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

790
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,710
Funny old world, isn't it?

791
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,840
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

792
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,020
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

793
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:01,400
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

794
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:04,780
and I negotiate the return
of your medallion?

795
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:09,450
Now that's exactly the attitude
that lost you the Pearl.

796
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:12,290
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

797
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,500
Lock him in the brig.

798
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,510
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

799
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,930
With this wind,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

800
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:36,770
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl is gaining on us!

801
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:43,650
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

802
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:46,070
Tell them that after they've caught us.

803
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:49,200
- We're shallower on the draft, right?
- Aye.

804
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,490
Then can't we lose them
on those shoals?

805
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:56,040
We don't have to outrun 'em long.
Just long enough.

806
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,460
Lighten the ship!
Stem to stern!

807
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:01,710
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

808
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:13,100
Apparently, there's a leak.

809
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,950
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

810
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,790
And run out the sweeps.

811
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,820
We're gonna need that.

812
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:14,740
It was a good plan, up till now.

813
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:16,240
Gibbs!

814
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:19,920
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!

815
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:22,250
- Load the guns!
- With what?

816
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:25,920
Anything! Everything!
Anything we have left.

817
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,880
Load the guns!

818
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:33,350
Case shot and langrage!
Nails and crushed glass!

819
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:37,890
With a will!

820
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:01,460
The Pearl will luff up
on our port quarter.

821
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,080
She'll rake us
without presenting a target.

822
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:06,710
Lower the anchor on the right side.

823
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,090
On the starboard side!

824
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:13,090
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady. You both are.

825
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:15,430
Daft like Jack.

826
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,390
Lower the starboard anchor!

827
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:21,180
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

828
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,160
Let go!

829
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,960
They're club hauling.

830
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:52,300
Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars!

831
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,090
Hard a port!

832
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,440
Keep her steady, man.

833
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,530
- Now!
- Fire!

834
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,570
Fire all!

835
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:28,340
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

836
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:18,800
- We need more ideas, lass!
- It's your turn!

837
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:22,100
- We need us a devil's dowry!
- We'll give them her!

838
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,640
She's not what they're after.

839
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,520
The medallion.

840
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,250
Strike your colours,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

841
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:56,090
Hands, grapnels at the ready!

842
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,130
Prepare to board!

843
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,710
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

844
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,550
Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!

845
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:40,760
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

846
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,670
Below!

847
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,520
Thanks very much.

848
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:47,830
Jack!

849
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,040
Bloody empty!

850
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:07,970
That's not very nice.

851
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,810
- Where is the medallion?
- Wretch!

852
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:20,440
Where is dear William?

853
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,650
Will.

854
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,120
Elizabeth!

855
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:32,200
Monkey!

856
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,710
I can't move it!

857
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:44,260
Elizabeth!

858
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,360
- Thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.

859
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,030
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

860
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,240
Gents! Our hope is restored!

861
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:46,240
Any of you so much
as thinks the word "parley",

862
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,070
I'll have your guts for garters!

863
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,370
Will.

864
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,000
You godless pirate!

865
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,210
Welcome back, miss.

866
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,010
You took advantage of our hospitality
last time.

867
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:09,590
It holds fair now you return the favour.

868
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:16,390
Barbossa!

869
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,270
Will.

870
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:24,230
She goes free!

871
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,650
What's in your head, boy?

872
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,280
She goes free.

873
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,570
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

874
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,950
Don't do anything stupid.

875
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:40,210
You can't. I can.

876
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,540
Like that.

877
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:48,170
- Who are you?
- No one. He's no one.

878
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,430
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

879
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:53,720
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.

880
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:58,270
My name is Will Turner!
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

881
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:00,890
His blood runs in my veins.

882
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:05,150
It's the spitting image of old
Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.

883
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,190
On my word, do as I say,

884
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:11,450
or I'll pull this trigger,
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

885
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,780
Name your terms, Mr Turner.

886
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:17,700
- Elizabeth goes free!
- Yes, we know that one.

887
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,790
Anything else?

888
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:25,340
And the crew. The crew
are not to be harmed.

889
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,300
Agreed.

890
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:54,860
Barbossa, you lying bastard.
You swore she'd go free.

891
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:58,950
Don't dare impugn me honour, boy.
I agreed she'd go free.

892
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:02,000
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

893
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:12,670
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

894
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:16,890
So I'll be havin' that dress back
before you go.

895
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,350
I always liked you.

896
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,690
Goes with your black heart.

897
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:31,780
It's still warm.

898
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,870
Off you go.

899
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:39,450
Come on.

900
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,210
Too long.

901
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:56,720
I'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

902
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:01,350
Jack. Jack!

903
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,020
Did you not notice?

904
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:08,690
That be the same island that we made
you governor of on our last little trip.

905
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:11,320
I did notice.

906
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:15,650
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape.

907
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,740
But I doubt it.

908
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:22,660
Off you go.

909
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:25,250
Last time you left me a pistol
with one shot.

910
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:29,210
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?

911
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:31,290
Bring it forward.

912
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:38,800
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

913
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:43,470
It'll be one pistol as before, and you
can be the gentleman and shoot the lady,

914
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,140
and starve to death yourself.

915
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:13,420
That's the second time
I've watched that man take my ship.

916
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:20,050
You were marooned on this island before.
We can escape in the same way.

917
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:23,050
To what point and purpose, young missy?

918
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:29,020
The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

919
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:30,940
Unlikely.

920
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:34,400
...young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

921
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:38,780
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

922
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:43,330
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company.

923
01:35:43,450 --> 01:35:46,160
You sacked Nassau port
without even firing a shot.

924
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,120
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

925
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,830
How did you escape last time?

926
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:03,970
Last time I was here
a grand total of three days.

927
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:06,770
Last time...

928
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:11,310
the rum runners
used this island as a cache.

929
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,360
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

930
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,940
From the looks of things,
they've long been out of business.

931
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:23,110
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

932
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,200
So that's it, then?

933
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:29,700
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow.

934
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:35,040
You spent three days
lying on a beach drinking rum.

935
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:41,170
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

936
01:36:49,390 --> 01:36:52,520
<i>We're devils, we're black sheep</i>
<i>We're really bad eggs</i>

937
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,600
<i>Drink up, me hearfies, yo ho</i>

938
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,730
<i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

939
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:59,360
<i>A pirate's life for me</i>

940
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,360
I love this song!

941
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:06,490
Really bad eggs!

942
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:13,330
When I get the Pearl back,

943
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:17,590
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,
and we'll sing it all the time.

944
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:21,420
You will be the most fearsome pirates
in the Spanish Main.

945
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:23,510
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

946
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:27,800
The entire ocean.
The entire world!

947
01:37:28,850 --> 01:37:32,350
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is.

948
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,230
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

949
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:38,770
That's what a ship needs.
But what a ship is...

950
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:44,070
What the Black Pearl really is...

951
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:46,910
is freedom.

952
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:49,990
Jack...

953
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:54,920
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

954
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,830
Oh, yes.

955
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,420
But the company is infinitely better
than last time.

956
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:06,590
And the scenery has definitely improved.

957
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,140
Mr Sparrow!

958
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:12,270
I'm not entirely sure I've had enough
rum to allow that kind of talk.

959
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,940
I know exactly what you mean, love.

960
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,780
To freedom!

961
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:29,530
To the Black Pearl!

962
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,560
No!

963
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:02,650
Not good! Stop!

964
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:04,940
Not good! What are you doing?

965
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:07,780
You've burned all the food,
the shade, the rum.

966
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:11,200
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?

967
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:15,870
One, because it is a vile drink that
turns respectable men into scoundrels.

968
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,290
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

969
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:21,630
The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.

970
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,300
Do you think there is the slightest
chance they won't see it?

971
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:26,970
But why is the rum gone?

972
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:31,850
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two,

973
01:39:31,970 --> 01:39:35,970
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

974
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:46,400
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

975
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:48,490
Well, it bloody is now!

976
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:58,660
There'll be no living with her
after this.

977
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:00,670
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.

978
01:40:00,790 --> 01:40:04,340
You're safe now. We will return
to Port Royal immediately,

979
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,420
not go gallivanting after pirates.

980
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:08,510
Then we condemn him to death.

981
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:14,930
The boy's fate is regrettable, but
so is his decision to engage in piracy.

982
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:18,220
To rescue me. To prevent anything
from happening to me.

983
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:22,600
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion.

984
01:40:22,730 --> 01:40:28,360
The Pearl was listing to scuppers after
the battle. She won't make good time.

985
01:40:28,490 --> 01:40:32,360
Think about it. The Black Pearl.

986
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:36,240
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

987
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:39,410
How can you pass that up?

988
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:45,210
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr Sparrow, not only myself.

989
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:48,920
Commodore, I beg you,
please do this for me.

990
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:51,130
As a wedding gift.

991
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,390
Elizabeth?

992
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:56,010
Are you accepting
the Commodore's proposal?

993
01:40:58,930 --> 01:40:59,930
I am.

994
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:03,900
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around!

995
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:08,940
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

996
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:15,700
Mr Sparrow, you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

997
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,200
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

998
01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:25,290
Then contemplate all possible meanings
of the phrase "silent as the grave".

999
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:29,170
- Do I make myself clear?
- Inescapably clear.

1000
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:36,510
Shiver me timbers.

1001
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,640
Cotton here says you missed a bit.

1002
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:46,190
You knew William Turner.

1003
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:49,270
Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.

1004
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:53,740
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1005
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:55,820
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we
did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.

1006
01:41:57,070 --> 01:42:00,040
He said it wasn't right with the Code.

1007
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:03,120
That's why he sent off
a piece of the treasure to you.

1008
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,210
He said we deserved to be cursed,

1009
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:10,460
and remain cursed.

1010
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:13,470
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.

1011
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:19,260
But, as you can imagine, that didn't
sit too well with the Captain.

1012
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:22,100
That didn't sit too well
with the Captain at all.

1013
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:25,810
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

1014
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:35,110
So what the captain did, he strapped
a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1015
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,700
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1016
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:42,290
Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was
sinking into the crushin' black oblivion

1017
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:45,540
of Davy Jones' locker!

1018
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:51,090
It was only after that we learned
we needed his blood to lift the curse.

1019
01:42:51,210 --> 01:42:53,510
That's what you call ironic.

1020
01:42:58,430 --> 01:43:00,390
Bring him.

1021
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:08,400
I don't care for the situation.

1022
01:43:08,770 --> 01:43:12,020
Any attempt to storm the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1023
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:15,440
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1024
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:19,200
I go in and get Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1025
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:25,370
Your mates return to the Dauntless
and blast them with your cannons.

1026
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,750
What do you have to lose?

1027
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:30,830
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1028
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,760
Now, to be honest, there's a risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1029
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,760
which includes the future Mrs Commodore.

1030
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:44,890
- It's for your own safety.
- I don't care, I have to tell him!

1031
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:48,100
The pirates are cursed!
They can't be killed!

1032
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:54,440
He's already informed of that. A mermaid
flopped up on deck and told the story.

1033
01:43:54,570 --> 01:43:57,530
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1034
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:12,250
No reason to fret. A prick of the
finger, a few drops of blood...

1035
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:17,760
No mistakes this time. He's only
half-Turner. We spill it all!

1036
01:44:20,090 --> 01:44:22,800
Guess there is reason to fret.

1037
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:42,070
- Beg your pardon.
- Begun by blood. By blood...

1038
01:44:45,370 --> 01:44:46,990
Jack!

1039
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:50,160
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

1040
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:53,000
Where's Elizabeth?

1041
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:58,630
Safe, like I promised. She's set to
marry Norrington, like she promised,

1042
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:01,130
and you get to die for her
like you promised.

1043
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:06,640
So we're all men of our word, except
for Elizabeth, who is a woman.

1044
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:09,220
Shut up! You're next!

1045
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:16,560
- You don't want to be doing that.
- No, I think I do.

1046
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:20,240
Your funeral.

1047
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:27,160
- Why don't I want to be doing it?
- Because...

1048
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:33,000
The HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy,

1049
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:37,880
is floating just offshore
waiting for you.

1050
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,560
What are we doing here?

1051
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:52,770
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1052
01:45:52,890 --> 01:45:58,440
We catch 'em in a crossfire
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1053
01:45:59,150 --> 01:46:05,570
I meant, why aren't we doing
what Mr Sparrow said we should do?

1054
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:10,580
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr Sparrow who said it.

1055
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:15,170
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1056
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,040
Hear me out, mate.

1057
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:22,090
Order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best,

1058
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:26,640
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your
aunt... There you are with two ships.

1059
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:28,930
The makings of your own fleet.

1060
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:32,640
You'll take the grandest as your
flagship and who's to argue?

1061
01:46:32,770 --> 01:46:35,690
But what of the Pearl?

1062
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:40,570
Name me captain, I'll sail under your
colours and give you 10% of me plunder

1063
01:46:40,690 --> 01:46:47,410
and you get to introduce yourself
as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

1064
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:51,450
And in exchange you want me
not to kill the whelp.

1065
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:56,710
Not at all. By all means,
kill the whelp. Just not yet.

1066
01:46:56,830 --> 01:47:01,710
Wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment.

1067
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:06,800
For instance...

1068
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,930
after you've killed Norrington's men.

1069
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,600
Every...

1070
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,350
last...

1071
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:16,850
one.

1072
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:30,530
You've planned this ever since
you learned my name.

1073
01:47:31,370 --> 01:47:33,030
Yeah.

1074
01:47:34,370 --> 01:47:36,580
I want 50% of your plunder.

1075
01:47:36,710 --> 01:47:37,870
- 15.
- 40.

1076
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,420
25.

1077
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:43,500
I'll buy you the hat.
A really big one.

1078
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:46,130
Commodore.

1079
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:50,720
We have an accord.

1080
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:53,720
All hands to the boats!

1081
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,520
Apologies. You give the orders.

1082
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:02,310
Gents... take a walk!

1083
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:09,650
Not to the boats?

1084
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,010
Hold fire.

1085
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:16,350
This is like what the Greeks
done at Troy.

1086
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:22,140
Except they was in a horse,
instead of dresses. Wooden horse.

1087
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:37,450
A moment, please.

1088
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,290
Elizabeth?

1089
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:50,210
I want you to know I believe you made
a very good decision today.

1090
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,340
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1091
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:59,010
But a good decision, if made for the
wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.

1092
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:09,690
Lieutenant.

1093
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:30,050
Elizabeth?

1094
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:33,920
Are you there?

1095
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:37,640
Are you even listening to me?

1096
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:06,960
What have you done?

1097
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,590
Stop that! I already feel like a fool.

1098
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:13,880
You look nice, though.

1099
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:19,930
I look nice?

1100
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:59,010
I must admit, Jack, I thought
I had you figured

1101
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:02,300
but it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1102
01:52:02,430 --> 01:52:07,270
I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man
you can trust to be dishonest.

1103
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:11,860
Honestly, it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1104
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:17,990
You can never predict when they're going
to do something incredibly... stupid.

1105
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:55,480
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters!

1106
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,030
Right.

1107
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:05,410
What would you eat first?

1108
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:09,660
We should decide now so we're ready
when the time comes.

1109
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,860
What was that?

1110
01:53:58,840 --> 01:53:59,880
Miss Elizabeth!

1111
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:22,070
Make for the ship! Move!

1112
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:33,330
To the ship!

1113
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,960
Row, men!

1114
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:17,460
You can't beat me, Jack.

1115
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:44,110
That's interesting.

1116
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,120
I couldn't resist, mate.

1117
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:03,610
Sorry!

1118
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:14,370
What now, Jack Sparrow?

1119
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:19,960
Are we to be two immortals, locked
in an epic battle until Judgment Day?

1120
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:22,790
Or you could surrender.

1121
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:52,740
All of you with me. Will is in that cave
and we must save him.

1122
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:55,410
Ready, and... heave!

1123
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:04,000
I need your help. Come on!

1124
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:06,920
Any port in a storm.

1125
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,460
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.

1126
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:13,220
- Are you gonna leave Jack?
- Jack owes us a ship.

1127
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:16,680
- There's the Code to consider.
- The Code?

1128
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:22,430
You're pirates. Hang the Code
and hang the rules!

1129
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,850
They're more like guidelines.

1130
01:58:28,730 --> 01:58:30,820
Bloody pirates!

1131
01:58:42,330 --> 01:58:44,460
Is it supposed to be doing that?

1132
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:47,000
They're stealing our ship.

1133
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:48,920
Bloody pirates!

1134
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,800
Boarders away.

1135
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:02,930
Come on!

1136
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:31,000
Me eye!

1137
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,400
I'll teach you the meaning of pain.

1138
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,730
You like pain?

1139
01:59:55,860 --> 01:59:57,990
Try wearing a corset.

1140
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:10,000
Whose side is Jack on?

1141
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:12,420
At the moment?

1142
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:49,330
No fair!

1143
02:01:12,690 --> 02:01:16,940
Ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot.

1144
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:20,610
He didn't waste it.

1145
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:47,430
I feel...

1146
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:53,810
cold.

1147
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,210
Parley?

1148
02:02:57,710 --> 02:03:01,800
- The ship is ours, gentlemen.
- Huzzah!

1149
02:03:07,930 --> 02:03:10,640
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1150
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:49,930
We should return to the Dauntless.

1151
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:56,100
Your fiancé will want to know
you're safe.

1152
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:09,700
If you were waiting
for the opportune moment...

1153
02:04:09,820 --> 02:04:12,030
that was it.

1154
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:17,660
Now, I'd be much obliged
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1155
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:24,670
I'm sorry, Jack.

1156
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:31,930
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1157
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:48,650
Jack Sparrow...

1158
02:04:49,490 --> 02:04:51,910
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1159
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:55,790
...for your crimes against the Crown.

1160
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:01,580
Said crimes being numerous in quantity
and sinister in nature.

1161
02:05:02,330 --> 02:05:05,920
The most egregious of these
to be cited herewith:

1162
02:05:06,050 --> 02:05:08,630
piracy, smuggling...

1163
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,930
This is wrong.

1164
02:05:11,050 --> 02:05:16,060
Commodore Norrington is bound
by the law, as are we all.

1165
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:19,680
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1166
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:23,440
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England,

1167
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:28,780
sailing under false colours,
arson, kidnapping, looting,

1168
02:05:28,900 --> 02:05:32,820
poaching, brigandage, pilfering,

1169
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:37,370
depravity, depredation
and general lawlessness.

1170
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:45,920
For these crimes, you are sentenced
to be hung by the neck until dead.

1171
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:49,630
May God have mercy on your soul.

1172
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,880
Governor Swann.

1173
02:05:52,010 --> 02:05:53,930
Commodore.

1174
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:56,720
Elizabeth.

1175
02:05:56,850 --> 02:06:01,520
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you...

1176
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:05,150
I love you.

1177
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:20,250
Watch yourself!

1178
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:22,120
Marines!

1179
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:24,210
I can't breathe.

1180
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:25,880
Elizabeth!

1181
02:06:29,090 --> 02:06:30,710
Move!

1182
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:48,540
I thought we might have to endure
some ill-conceived escape attempt,

1183
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:50,630
but not from you.

1184
02:07:50,750 --> 02:07:53,920
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1185
02:07:54,050 --> 02:07:58,800
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?

1186
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:01,510
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.

1187
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:08,480
If this means the hangman will earn two
pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.

1188
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,310
My conscience will be clear.

1189
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:13,400
You forget your place, Turner.

1190
02:08:15,240 --> 02:08:19,450
It's right here, between you and Jack.

1191
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:25,250
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1192
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:30,670
Lower your weapons.
Put them down!

1193
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:38,720
So this is where your heart truly lies?

1194
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:41,890
It is.

1195
02:08:50,650 --> 02:08:54,190
I'm feeling good about this.

1196
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:56,690
We've all arrived at a special place.

1197
02:08:56,820 --> 02:09:02,070
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1198
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:06,830
I want you to know
that I was rooting for you, mate.

1199
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:08,830
Know that.

1200
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,210
Elizabeth.

1201
02:09:15,630 --> 02:09:19,050
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

1202
02:09:19,340 --> 02:09:21,010
I'm sorry.

1203
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:25,600
Will.

1204
02:09:26,770 --> 02:09:29,140
Nice hat.

1205
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:31,600
Friends.

1206
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:38,900
This is the day that you will always
remember as the day that...

1207
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:46,620
Idiot. He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1208
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:50,870
Sail ho!

1209
02:09:58,510 --> 02:10:00,840
What's your plan of action?

1210
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:03,590
Sir!

1211
02:10:07,430 --> 02:10:11,100
Perhaps on the rare occasion,
pursuing the right course

1212
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:13,440
demands an act of piracy.

1213
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:17,440
Piracy itself can be the right course.

1214
02:10:21,990 --> 02:10:23,990
Mr Turner.

1215
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:31,960
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1216
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:40,210
This is a beautiful sword.

1217
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:44,130
I expect the man who made it

1218
02:10:44,260 --> 02:10:48,640
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1219
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:52,390
Thank you.

1220
02:10:55,270 --> 02:10:58,150
Commodore! What about Sparrow?

1221
02:11:00,070 --> 02:11:04,320
I think we can afford to give him
one day's head start.

1222
02:11:09,450 --> 02:11:11,700
So...

1223
02:11:12,330 --> 02:11:15,250
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1224
02:11:16,830 --> 02:11:20,500
After all, he is a blacksmith.

1225
02:11:21,630 --> 02:11:23,630
No.

1226
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:29,720
He's a pirate.

1227
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:09,430
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the Code?

1228
02:12:09,550 --> 02:12:13,390
We figured they were more
actual... guidelines.

1229
02:12:17,810 --> 02:12:19,310
Thank you.

1230
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:22,610
Captain Sparrow.

1231
02:12:26,070 --> 02:12:28,320
The Black Pearl is yours.

1232
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:49,300
On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands
to braces! Let go and haul to run free!

1233
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:54,510
Now... bring me that horizon.

1234
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:04,610
<i>And really bad eggs</i>
