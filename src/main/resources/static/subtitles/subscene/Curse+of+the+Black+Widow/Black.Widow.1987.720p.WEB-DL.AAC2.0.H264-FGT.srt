1
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:26,032
When he didn't come to the office,
10:30, 11:00...

2
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,624
...I called the house.

3
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:31,123
Catharine...

4
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:34,957
...he went in his sleep,
so peacefully.

5
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:38,460
The doctor said if you slept
next to him...

6
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:41,258
...you wouldn't even have known.

7
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,552
You couldn't have done anything.

8
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,897
Mrs. Petersen.

9
00:02:58,156 --> 00:03:01,442
- Catharine, let me come up with you.
- No.

10
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:04,191
You get some rest, Sara.

11
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,299
Nice blouse, Alex.
- Has been for years, Michael.

12
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:25,633
I'm late. I spent the whole morning
going over obituaries.

13
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,345
The whole morning?

14
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:30,383
<i>Yeah. Detroit Free Press on your list?
April 12th.</i>

15
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:33,760
I don't roll out of bed
and read obituaries before coffee.

16
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:37,305
Wasn't this guy a capo for Marangano
a few years back?

17
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,809
- So?
- So...

18
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:42,766
...two guys die within four days
of each other. What does that say?

19
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:46,989
No pattern. This guy could've been
a hit, but Marangano died in his sleep.

20
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:49,482
He stopped breathing.
They ran a full...

21
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,486
- Not now.
Is that what Bruce thinks?

22
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:52,693
Alex.

23
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:57,035
A government pouch to someone's
home is illegal. Worse, it's expensive.

24
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:00,827
Well, my contribution
to the federal deficit.

25
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:08,544
And let go of this Marangano thing.
People die in their sleep. Even dons.

26
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,677
It was a hit!
Hey, keep it down.

27
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:13,172
He ran trash collection
for half of Jersey.

28
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,019
- You don't die in your sleep of...
Ondine's Curse.

29
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:19,851
"Damage of unknown origin to the part
of the brain that controls breathing."

30
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,850
It's rare. It's real. It happens.

31
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:26,854
Yeah, I'm here six years, it never
happened. You do a run on it?

32
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,072
- This the only one?
- It can't be connected.

33
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:37,408
This guy's not Mafia. He's some
millionaire publisher from New York.

34
00:06:37,582 --> 00:06:38,910
"Cause of death unknown.

35
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,120
Evidence suggests unexplained
interruption of breathing.

36
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:44,584
Consider possibility of Ondine's Curse.

37
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:49,501
Sam Petersen, age 60. Survived
by his wife of four months, Catharine...

38
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:54,007
...age 31."
- And I had to go back a year to get that.

39
00:06:55,433 --> 00:07:00,676
Alex, it's the only one. Believe me.
Believe me, there's nothing there.

40
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,863
I've got it sitting right here
in front of me.

41
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:24,703
Walter, you see, I don't know how
to read the goddamn instructions.

42
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,129
I'm only 5 fucking years old.

43
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:32,795
Now, you be my daddy,
and you tell me how to use it.

44
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,592
Nice and simple.

45
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:41,603
Oh, you're goddamn right I'm serious.
But my bride is here for our luncheon.

46
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:44,688
Well, I've never been
anybody's daddy neither.

47
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:49,685
But if you want me to pop for 200,000
units of this little plastic turd here...

48
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:52,270
...I suggest that you start faking it.

49
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:57,028
<i>How's that wife of yours?
- She don't look so good today.</i>

50
00:07:57,203 --> 00:08:00,702
<i>- She's the best-looking gal in Dallas.
- She looks kind of scrag.</i>

51
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:03,280
<i>Scraggly, my ass.</i>

52
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:06,248
Write some of these instructions
in English.

53
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,587
<i>- Maybe you can find a market for this.
- I'm on top of it.</i>

54
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,841
Yeah, okay, yeah. So long, then.

55
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:18,806
Marielle, you think anybody's gonna
be interested in a thing like this?

56
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:24,265
It's about winning, Ben.
Everybody's interested in winning.

57
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,107
They forgot that they're
making this toy for kids.

58
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,228
The instructions are too complicated.

59
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:35,858
Hot damn!

60
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:59,530
I gotta be the world's
number one airhead.

61
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,910
Be gone five days, and I'm packing
half of Neiman Marcus here.

62
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:07,742
Marielle?

63
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,742
Yeah, hon?

64
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,331
How come we run out of brandy
so quick, hon?

65
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:17,046
Didn't I see a fresh bottle
in the cabinet?

66
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:29,432
Right again, hon.

67
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:54,870
Marielle, I've explained to Etta
that this will is valid in all respects.

68
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:59,423
Any contest here would just be
a waste of time and money.

69
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,508
My time.

70
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,171
My money.

71
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:09,345
What, a man cuts his only sister out of
his will two months after marrying a...?

72
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,096
Younger woman?

73
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:16,480
You know something, Etta,
your husband is right.

74
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,022
Ben had no quarrel with you.

75
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:22,444
Only the way you felt about me.

76
00:11:23,532 --> 00:11:26,403
I think, if he were here...

77
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:30,161
...he'd regret what he'd done.

78
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,869
Martin?

79
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:38,915
What are the tax consequences
if I make a small gift?

80
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,331
Young lady...

81
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:46,174
Marielle is going to go back
to Charleston...

82
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:51,803
...and she doesn't want any
harsh feelings or needless delays.

83
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:56,186
How small a gift, dear?

84
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,605
Something in the mid-six figures?

85
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:20,621
Miss Barnes! Miss Barnes?

86
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,798
Miss Barnes, can I look
in your purse, please?

87
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:28,969
Here she comes!

88
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,937
What? You gonna knock over
a liquor store?

89
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:45,687
I was just at the target range.
I'm trying to get certified, that's all.

90
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:50,403
I tell you what.
Send the piece back to Sears.

91
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:57,622
Remember that Ondine's Curse thing?

92
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:04,382
Another one came up today.

93
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,049
This guy died 10 days ago.

94
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,976
Dinner?

95
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:24,561
What?

96
00:13:24,735 --> 00:13:29,314
- I said, dinner? Eat? Tonight?
- I have work left.

97
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,574
Fine. Tomorrow?

98
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:35,910
I don't think it's a good idea.
We work together.

99
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,164
What, office policy? What?

100
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,997
Okay. I resign.

101
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:46,921
I can't afford to lose you.
You're my right arm.

102
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,088
Okay.

103
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,721
What did you say about Ondine's Curse?

104
00:13:58,894 --> 00:14:01,219
- It's not Mafia.
- What is it?

105
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:04,813
It's a toy manufacturer from Dallas.

106
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:10,274
He's very rich. He's very clean.
I'll get you a printout tomorrow, okay?

107
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,984
- Good night.
- Good night.

108
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,248
Michael.

109
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,583
Wait up.

110
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:27,161
I'm gonna go with you.

111
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:33,417
Could a Texas toy mogul
have a mob connection?

112
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:36,513
The Texan's a ringer
for that other guy from New York.

113
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:39,469
How's that?
- Well, both older guys, very rich...

114
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,679
...each married to a young gal
for a couple of months.

115
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:46,899
- Must be kind of bad for your health.
- Hey, you got a minute?

116
00:14:56,243 --> 00:15:00,240
Make some calls to New York, Dallas.
Newspapers, whatever.

117
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:02,572
Let's round up some photos.

118
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:06,367
Shouldn't be hard.
They were prominent guys.

119
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:08,954
Not the men.

120
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,253
The wives.

121
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:33,273
Okay.

122
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:38,613
Seattle guidebooks,
Japanese cooking, what next?

123
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:42,119
- Rare coins.
- What sort of rare coins?

124
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:48,077
Something general for the beginner, then
something more particular. Perhaps...

125
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:49,961
...Italy, the 19th century.

126
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:53,166
Before the city-states were unified
or after?

127
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:56,046
I don't know.
Which would be more...

128
00:15:57,178 --> 00:15:59,634
...unusual?

129
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:04,508
Northwest Indians. Which tribes?

130
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:08,055
Coast Salish, for certain.
Whatever else you have.

131
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:11,018
Tlingit, Bella Coola, Kwakiutl.

132
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:13,398
My primary interest is in totem poles.

133
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:16,191
What are you,
cramming for a game show?

134
00:18:21,154 --> 00:18:24,404
No, I'll take it. Thank you.

135
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:52,799
Come here. Come here, children.
Teachers, let's move them along.

136
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:54,810
Come this way.

137
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,151
One million dollars.

138
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:10,190
A very generous offer, Miss Dodd...

139
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:13,454
...but this museum does not sell
places on its board.

140
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:14,951
- Our chairman...
- Yes.

141
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:18,956
I'm sure Mr. McCorey will appreciate
my intentions. Good day.

142
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:25,466
But Margaret,
we want your views on this.

143
00:19:25,635 --> 00:19:29,715
Now, I understand you had very
strong feelings about this collection.

144
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:32,296
Mr. McCorey...

145
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:35,511
...I didn't want my first meeting
to be one where I...

146
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:37,180
You disagreed with anybody.

147
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:43,275
I think it's a mistake to concentrate
so exclusively...

148
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:45,935
...on the Coast Salish in our acquisitions.

149
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:50,819
You want to be the best at something,
but that's not our role.

150
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,487
And what is, Margaret?

151
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:55,662
We need to compare all the tribes.

152
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:58,916
We study their art to learn about them.

153
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:02,916
We study them
to understand ourselves.

154
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:11,006
These the best pictures?
She doesn't want pictures.

155
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,967
She knows the camera's there.
She turns away.

156
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:16,679
The Texas one is different,
slimmer body.

157
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:19,177
- It's the way she's stand...
- She's younger.

158
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:22,190
- It's makeup, hair, attitude.
- I think you're wrong.

159
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:23,900
I could be right.

160
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:27,603
The whole m.o., a complex series
of seductions and murders...

161
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,105
...that's not something
you see a woman do.

162
00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:35,110
Oh? Which part you figure a woman isn't
up to? The seduction or the murder?

163
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:37,908
Look, I just want the field assignment.

164
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:40,489
- Please?
- Listen...

165
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:43,372
...data analysis is the heart
of what we do here.

166
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:46,914
The best work in this shop
is yours. The best.

167
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,590
- It's a job you were born to do.
- It's a job with green windows!

168
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:53,548
Bruce, I've been in this office
for six years.

169
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:56,842
This goddamned government
office with green windows.

170
00:20:57,017 --> 00:21:01,097
You want excitement. People
don't look to get it all from their job.

171
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,390
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jesus.

172
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:07,235
What do you think it means?
Having a date!

173
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:11,981
When was the last time you rolled in late
on a Monday because of a big weekend?

174
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:15,490
I really can't believe
you're saying this to me!

175
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:18,365
I have to listen to this shit
from my mother!

176
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:21,705
What the hell do you think
you are, Bruce?

177
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:28,419
Look, I just...

178
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:33,874
You're not happy.

179
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:37,216
You're not a happy person.

180
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:41,425
And you deserve to be, that's all.

181
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:46,353
Bruce, make me happy.

182
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:58,951
Even if you're right, it isn't federal.

183
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:05,079
Whatever you can't fit on the
weekends, make sure you call in sick.

184
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,207
Thanks.

185
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:22,263
She was destroyed by his death.
They were very devoted.

186
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:26,479
Catharine needed to get away,
and she went to Europe.

187
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:30,016
That was over a year ago.
Have you heard from her?

188
00:22:30,192 --> 00:22:34,689
I had a postcard from Rome. I had
a lovely note from Vienna, a little gift.

189
00:22:34,864 --> 00:22:39,360
All in the first month, or thereabouts.
Anything lately?

190
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:41,612
Only the attorney.

191
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:45,203
He received instructions
to convert the estate into cash...

192
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:48,286
...and to transfer the funds
to a Swiss account.

193
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:52,293
No one else in Manhattan,
not a single soul.

194
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:55,668
Everyone says the same thing.
From Chicago, no family...

195
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:59,259
...they don't know where she lived,
where she worked.

196
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:02,264
Could I have this photograph?

197
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:11,262
I'm sorry.
That must have sounded awful.

198
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:19,110
Sara, it's just that she came out of thin
air, and she vanished back into thin air.

199
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:23,530
- Well, is that against the law?
- It's odd. I find it odd.

200
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:29,870
Sam Petersen is gone.
So is all of his property, his money.

201
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:35,079
And if I loved him as much as you did,
I'd find it very odd indeed.

202
00:23:40,304 --> 00:23:45,131
That's Felice Baciocchi
and her sister Elisa.

203
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:51,518
You probably looked all this up
just to impress me.

204
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,724
Did it work?

205
00:23:56,236 --> 00:24:02,689
Well, you know, I really did wonder.
You seem almost too good to be true.

206
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:06,494
I thought of checking up on you.

207
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:13,791
Not a bad thought.

208
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:17,663
After all, I could be
practically anybody.

209
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:21,169
Dangerous not to check people out.

210
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,503
I did.

211
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:28,762
And what did you find?

212
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:35,567
I found that you went to Mount
Holyoke, you studied anthropology...

213
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:39,019
...and I found...

214
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:42,192
...we're a lot alike.

215
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:48,995
We like Italy, and we like coins.

216
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:51,741
And we like to live alone.

217
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,831
You never talk about that.

218
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:02,133
I don't know why I never married.

219
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:05,006
I have a serviceable list of reasons.

220
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:10,766
Take out my reasons
and polish them every once in a while.

221
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:14,389
I kept on growing out
in all these...

222
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:18,727
...peculiar and idiosyncratic directions.

223
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:23,400
I'd put on a little bristle here
and a bristle there...

224
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:25,696
...and sort of...

225
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:28,073
...turned myself into a porcupine.

226
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:36,666
- What?
- Well, it's just such an old joke.

227
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:39,208
How do two porcupines...

228
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,752
...make love?

229
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:46,633
Very carefully.

230
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:57,720
To the left, right around this corner.
You'll find it.

231
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:11,194
It's kind of you to make time
in your busy schedule for me.

232
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:13,328
No trouble at all.

233
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,158
So have you thought at all
about what I said?

234
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:20,288
Uh-huh. You know something?

235
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:23,997
That very same idea occurred to me
right after the funeral.

236
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:26,131
I even hired a detective.

237
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:30,595
Sent him over to Charleston,
where she said her people were at.

238
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:34,465
There was nothing at all.
No family, not even a trace.

239
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:38,639
Why didn't you come forward, Etta?

240
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:42,106
Ben was gone.
I couldn't bring him back.

241
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:45,691
I thought, "It'll be in the papers."
I didn't want a big scandal.

242
00:26:45,862 --> 00:26:48,484
Okay, about the will, Etta.

243
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,942
Rice Institute was the only
other beneficiary, wasn't it?

244
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,870
Yes. Ben was gracious and...

245
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:57,790
And I bet you wondered
if Marielle got caught...

246
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:01,243
...Rice might just take back
that little gift she gave you.

247
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:12,262
You're looking a little peaked, dear.

248
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,135
Can I buy you a tan?

249
00:27:56,307 --> 00:28:01,728
I've been coming here about this time
of year since I was 5 years old.

250
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,148
And every year, when we'd leave...

251
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:10,355
...I'd feel this sense of...

252
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:14,365
...Ioss, I suppose.

253
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:25,285
Always promised myself
I'd live here someday.

254
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,127
Why don't you?

255
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,339
Why don't we?

256
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,873
What is this thing?
You almost broke my tooth.

257
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:14,880
Medic alert.
I'm allergic to penicillin.

258
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,769
We're done. We're all done.

259
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,938
Last hand, you guys.

260
00:29:36,114 --> 00:29:39,032
Herb's got it, honey.
He's got that look.

261
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:43,534
That's the look?
That's the look.

262
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:45,579
Yeah, I'm done.

263
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:49,035
You do got it,
you lame son of a bitch.

264
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:56,790
I'll see your 20
and kick you 20.

265
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,638
What is that, suicide?
Some kind of sympathy ploy?

266
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:03,637
- Called putting up your money. Herbert?
- I got it, Alex. Keep your 40.

267
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:06,765
Kick me back.

268
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,264
Just call. All blue, darling.

269
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,437
Remember last week?

270
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:19,444
- I think we're even now, baby.
Yeah, well, I gotta get out of here.

271
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,569
Hold on a second, will you, please?

272
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:25,785
- Guys, come on.
Take it easy!

273
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:28,328
This is my money. I've got about...

274
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,501
I got about 40, 50, $60 here.

275
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,746
I already got this money spent.

276
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:36,413
Yeah, what are you buying?
New underwear?

277
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:42,426
You took Alex out once, didn't you?
Yeah, Redskins game.

278
00:30:42,597 --> 00:30:45,349
So how'd it go?

279
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:47,226
Skins lost.

280
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:52,397
Hi.

281
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:55,056
You want your neck rubbed?

282
00:30:55,235 --> 00:30:57,523
No.

283
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,817
I want my neck rubbed.

284
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,987
- Oh, man.
- Thinking about your Borgia lady?

285
00:31:09,165 --> 00:31:10,624
Uh-huh.

286
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:15,080
- You figure out how she hits them?
- Oh, Christ, I don't know.

287
00:31:15,254 --> 00:31:19,418
It could be methadone.
It leaves a negligible trace.

288
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:22,718
You know how many men over 50...

289
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,804
...married women under 40
in the last four months?

290
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:28,426
No.

291
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:30,558
Neither do I.

292
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:34,978
Now try the top 30 cities.

293
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:38,105
You tell me.

294
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:45,408
Exactly a zillion.

295
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,490
And that's the easy part.

296
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:52,281
Now try crossing that
against millionaires.

297
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,747
Get photos of the women.

298
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:58,123
And you could use more computer time.

299
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:00,171
No, I'm there.

300
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:03,340
I'm down to six ladies.

301
00:32:03,511 --> 00:32:05,752
That includes the two
I got this week.

302
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,337
You can't be traveling
all over the country...

303
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:11,267
No, I gotta check it out.

304
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:13,724
I gotta check them out.

305
00:32:17,274 --> 00:32:19,563
What, are you scared for me?

306
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:22,900
You're full of shit, Bruce.

307
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:26,653
Call you from Denver.

308
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:29,360
Maybe Seattle.

309
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:31,864
See you.

310
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:35,872
<i>Pull your cars
as far forward as possible.</i>

311
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:38,119
<i>Stop your engine.</i>

312
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:41,459
<i>Set your emergency brake.</i>

313
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:57,782
Everything's fine.
You can get dressed.

314
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:03,457
Doctor, I almost forgot.
I have this recurring tonsillitis and...

315
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,955
...well, with this Seattle weather...

316
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:08,457
What usually works for you?

317
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:10,508
Penicillin.

318
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,720
I think she said her degree
was in anthropology.

319
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:17,132
Vassar or Smith or...

320
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:20,726
- And she was originally from...?
- New England, I think.

321
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:24,313
Maybe it wasn't. It's funny.
I see her three times a week and...

322
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:27,230
Sally, is Mrs. McCorey across the hall?

323
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:31,021
Please check. I have a reporter
who'd like some background on her.

324
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,606
I'd rather not bother her,
if you don't mind.

325
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:37,990
I don't like to impose on my subjects
till I have something written up...

326
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:40,655
...you know, in case they want
to make changes.

327
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,660
Margaret isn't in this morning.

328
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:45,587
William, this is Mrs. Talley.

329
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:47,712
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

330
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:50,497
<i>She's with the Post-Intelligencer.</i>

331
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:54,134
They're doing a piece on our
more prominent women volunteers.

332
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:58,089
I know your managing editor well.
You're on metro desk, features?

333
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:02,265
I'm not with the paper, actually.
I'm freelance.

334
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:04,845
I was hoping they would
pick up an article.

335
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:06,648
I'm working in the storeroom.

336
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:08,810
- Why don't we talk there?
- Fine.

337
00:35:12,656 --> 00:35:14,779
Please don't touch anything down here.

338
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,117
- Your home phone?
- Well, I don't live here in town.

339
00:35:20,956 --> 00:35:23,743
- So you're staying at the...?
- The Hilton.

340
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:25,827
- Look...
- Airport?

341
00:35:26,003 --> 00:35:27,378
Downtown.

342
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:30,255
Just one question.

343
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:34,753
Why did you lie back there
about the paper?

344
00:35:37,055 --> 00:35:39,807
I'm sorry. I really am, I...

345
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:42,510
See, I'm just starting out.

346
00:35:42,686 --> 00:35:46,102
<i>I thought an article on powerful
women might sell to Cosmo...</i>

347
00:35:46,315 --> 00:35:49,351
<i>...or Woman 's Day, and so...
- Oh, yeah, I see, I see.</i>

348
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:54,147
I never had to prove myself like that.

349
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:57,364
It must be hard for you.

350
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:03,955
My wife's a very private person,
and I respect that.

351
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:09,168
But let me talk to her, and we'll see
if we can't help you out.

352
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:13,174
That's very understanding of you.

353
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,810
Anything else?

354
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:37,321
I think that's it, thanks.

355
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:46,114
Hey! Hey, Leo, will you fix that screen?

356
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,960
Okay, I'll fix it!

357
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:50,704
- All right!
Come on, man!

358
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,871
- I'll fix it!
Another movie on survival?

359
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,752
<i>Just because
you can 't see a suspect...</i>

360
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,550
<i>... doesn 't mean he can 't see you.</i>

361
00:36:58,011 --> 00:37:01,676
There's a resemblance, but I've seen
strangers who look like twins.

362
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:05,845
You're looking for a reason to kiss
this off because you can't stomach it.

363
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:08,142
Yeah, what are you looking for?

364
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:11,563
Why do you wanna bury this lady?
Two guys die of some curse?

365
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:15,315
Ondine's Curse. They died in their sleep.
They stopped breathing.

366
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:18,024
When McCorey dies
of the same thing, call me.

367
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:20,523
You said the wives were out of town.

368
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:23,869
She poisoned them.
She put it in some...

369
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:26,527
Something she thought
they'd drink or eat.

370
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:28,658
These boys were autopsied.

371
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:32,000
You got cops in New York or Dallas
wanna dig up the bodies?

372
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:35,835
No, but you want me to tell one
of the richest men in this state...

373
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:38,794
...that some Fed thinks
his wife's a murderer...

374
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,836
...when nobody thinks
there's a homicide.

375
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:44,511
You're right. You solved
the whole case from your desk.

376
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:46,840
Why not take the rest of the day off?

377
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:50,013
You're absolutely right.
Hello, Mrs. McCorey?

378
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:54,179
Would you come to the station
and tell us if you ever killed anybody?

379
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,774
No, ma'am, we don't have any evidence.

380
00:37:56,944 --> 00:38:00,479
I just spent the whole morning
showing you the evidence!

381
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:03,699
If that's what the Justice Department
calls evidence...

382
00:38:03,868 --> 00:38:07,201
...then that is the scariest part
of this whole conversation.

383
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,449
The thing is, I know I'm right.

384
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:34,349
So, what do you think?

385
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,516
The playing's better than the piano.

386
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,684
Oh, right.

387
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,810
I'll get a tuner out here tomorrow.

388
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:48,741
Oh, a young woman stopped
by the museum.

389
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:52,079
She's researching an article about you.

390
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:56,199
I liked her.
She seemed really very sweet.

391
00:38:57,796 --> 00:38:59,255
Fix you a gin?

392
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,004
Ma'am.

393
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:11,050
Check again.

394
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:14,974
Look, she told my husband
she was here waiting for a call.

395
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,099
She was here.

396
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:22,101
Checked out this afternoon.
Transferring to the Inn at the Market.

397
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,983
Perhaps I could call for you.

398
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,936
Shit!

399
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,314
Margaret?

400
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,983
Yeah, I'm up here!
- Oh, I'll come up.

401
00:41:36,787 --> 00:41:39,194
No, no, no.
I'll be down in just a minute.

402
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,784
I thought you were fishing.
No luck?

403
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:49,747
I was gonna call the lawyer
about the board meeting.

404
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,842
I think it's a mistake, sweetheart.

405
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:55,763
Shit.

406
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:00,972
It's a family business.

407
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:08,270
You put me on another board,
there'll just be conflict and resentment.

408
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,654
You're my wife.
I want you with me.

409
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,483
I do like the way you say that.

410
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,744
- Where'd they find him?
- Look, Agatha Christie.

411
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:28,626
He didn't die of any breathing disease.
Just a good old-fashioned heart attack.

412
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,630
- Did they do an autopsy?
- Yes...

413
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,047
...they did, and a toxicology screen.

414
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:37,043
Great, that covers about 60
compounds at the outside.

415
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,256
You think she wouldn't
know what to avoid?

416
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,683
Anaphylactic shock looks
like cardiac arrest.

417
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,849
Was he allergic to something?

418
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,228
- Bee venom? Antibiotics?
- Bee venom!

419
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,191
Bee venom.
You're not gonna believe this...

420
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,155
...but I overlooked that possibility.
Boy, that's gonna be my ass.

421
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,990
She's left town,
and you don't know where.

422
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:06,155
Lady, there's been no homicide.
Why should I care where she went?

423
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:09,246
Enough to know she's left.
You're scared shitless.

424
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:13,756
They're gonna find out about me
and wonder why you didn't check it out.

425
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:18,178
If you got a complaint, go file it.
Otherwise, please, go fuck yourself.

426
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,156
It's not a reason.

427
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:42,695
I was in the room with him.
He was four feet away from me.

428
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:46,363
- And what were you supposed to do?
- I don't know.

429
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,034
I just...

430
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,663
...should have...

431
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,453
...said it. Told him.
- He'd have believed you?

432
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,675
He would have had a chance.
I didn't give him a chance!

433
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:03,222
He would've gone straight to her,
then you're blown and she's gone.

434
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,881
And maybe he's alive.

435
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,015
Alex, you don't quit your job...

436
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,900
...six years...

437
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,402
...to go chasing after some phantom!

438
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,861
She's not a phantom.

439
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,540
Come on. Come on!

440
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:38,208
We got her. I think we got her.
I think we finally got her.

441
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,778
Hi.
Hi.

442
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,318
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

443
00:45:07,412 --> 00:45:08,906
This is from me.

444
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,203
I already have my ticket to Hawaii.

445
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:13,450
That's your ticket back.

446
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:17,833
What makes you so sure
she's even there?

447
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:23,510
Michael says the lady at the ticket
counter in Seattle recognized her photo.

448
00:45:23,678 --> 00:45:27,261
Who's to say she didn't fly out of Hawaii
under any name at all?

449
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:29,508
Maybe she did.

450
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,266
Where else am I gonna start?

451
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:41,234
I heard you sold all your stuff.
- Yeah.

452
00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:43,942
- What'd you get for the BMW?
- Well...

453
00:45:44,115 --> 00:45:47,484
...I got 5900 for it.
Blue Book said 66...

454
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,409
...but the salesman was wearing
a bow tie and I was in a hurry.

455
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,949
Would you do me a favor?

456
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,954
Would you get this back to Sears?

457
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:07,927
- Don't underestimate this woman.
- She's not about guns.

458
00:46:08,097 --> 00:46:11,264
You want to catch her,
you gotta think like she thinks.

459
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:12,809
I think.

460
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:16,388
And you figure you know her, huh?
Why she does it?

461
00:46:16,731 --> 00:46:18,355
Tell me.

462
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:23,732
When I was a kid, my father...
I told you this story, though, didn't I?

463
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:25,986
My dad had quite a temper.

464
00:46:26,157 --> 00:46:29,241
He used to take off after me
with this spatula, you know.

465
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:33,159
Stainless steel pancake turner.
Man, that thing stung like hell.

466
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:36,285
One of these times,
he chased me down the hall...

467
00:46:36,459 --> 00:46:40,456
...and he got me into my bedroom,
and he was beating the crap out of me.

468
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,875
Man.

469
00:46:42,048 --> 00:46:44,965
And he stood up, keeled over and died.

470
00:46:47,511 --> 00:46:50,049
I figure Margaret,
or whatever her name is...

471
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:54,220
...has some deep resentment
against older men and...

472
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:56,513
Are you buying this?

473
00:46:56,687 --> 00:46:59,641
I can't believe you really went for it.

474
00:47:00,232 --> 00:47:02,024
Goddamn it.

475
00:47:02,234 --> 00:47:05,271
Don't you know? No one knows
why anyone does anything.

476
00:47:05,446 --> 00:47:09,194
I know she's obsessed with killing
and you're obsessed with her.

477
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:13,152
What worries me is that
you might be as wacky as she is.

478
00:47:15,539 --> 00:47:17,330
I'll be back with a tan.

479
00:47:31,472 --> 00:47:35,516
Over here, all of you going
to Kilauea, line up here please.

480
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:35,154
Whoo.

481
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:34,338
We are standing at the newest
place on this planet.

482
00:49:36,637 --> 00:49:39,971
It's like nowhere on Earth.

483
00:49:42,685 --> 00:49:45,176
I love this place!

484
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:53,147
Everybody comes to Hawaii
for the sand, for the beach...

485
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,484
...but to put a hotel here,
it would cost a fortune.

486
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:02,319
Do you know what?

487
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:05,497
My bankers say I'm insane.

488
00:50:08,127 --> 00:50:12,789
God, in the right spot,
it would be fantastic!

489
00:50:30,107 --> 00:50:33,392
You always been impatient, lady?
I mean, your whole life?

490
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:37,697
Mr. Shin, in four weeks
I've given you $600.

491
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:40,534
You, by way of contrast,
have given me zip.

492
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:44,202
I'm surprised you can find
your office in the morning.

493
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:48,832
You always sarcastic like that?
You were sarcastic little baby?

494
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:51,918
You look for lady for four weeks, huh?

495
00:50:52,087 --> 00:50:54,874
One time I look for somebody
for 18 years.

496
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:57,918
Quite a recommendation.

497
00:50:58,593 --> 00:51:00,716
Persistence.

498
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:05,715
Besides, can't find such a pretty lady
for buck and a half a week.

499
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:09,226
- Need incentive bonus.
- No, just show me what you've got.

500
00:51:09,604 --> 00:51:11,763
What do you mean, huh?
I got nothing.

501
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,107
Mr. Shin, any man that would ask me
for a price increase...

502
00:51:15,277 --> 00:51:18,646
...without anything to deliver
would be kind of stupid.

503
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:21,028
No point in insulting
your intelligence.

504
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:24,242
I'd rather do business on a basis
of mutual respect.

505
00:51:24,744 --> 00:51:26,618
That's good.

506
00:51:26,788 --> 00:51:29,279
- I like respect.
- Fine.

507
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,125
Where is she?

508
00:51:31,459 --> 00:51:34,129
All right, ladies,
before we re-enter the pool...

509
00:51:34,295 --> 00:51:39,716
...let's review the most important rule:
Never race your bubbles to the surface.

510
00:51:39,884 --> 00:51:46,172
It can cause lung expansion, which
can result in air in the bloodstream.

511
00:51:46,349 --> 00:51:50,477
This can produce an embolism,
which can result in...

512
00:51:50,645 --> 00:51:54,228
- You all right? Maybe you should sit out.
- A very agonizing death.

513
00:51:56,234 --> 00:51:59,021
Now then, ladies, let's get in the pool.

514
00:52:05,618 --> 00:52:07,825
Good. Okay, ladies,
come around here.

515
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:10,991
Come on. Come on, all of you.

516
00:52:11,165 --> 00:52:16,207
We're going to pair up and practice
breathing two on the same regulator.

517
00:52:16,379 --> 00:52:19,131
This would be necessary
when one runs out of air.

518
00:52:19,298 --> 00:52:21,587
Now pair up. You and you.
You and you.

519
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:27,466
That's right. Take the regulator and give
it to your partner for emergency air.

520
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,807
Partners? Don't worry.
I'm not really contagious.

521
00:52:30,977 --> 00:52:34,926
My friend promised me she'd
be my partner, so...

522
00:52:35,147 --> 00:52:39,097
Well, that leaves me odd man out,
doesn't it?

523
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,194
- Rennie Walker.
- Jessica Bates.

524
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:46,234
- Jessica Bates, I owe you a beer.
- Take you up on it.

525
00:52:46,409 --> 00:52:49,409
Now you take the regulator
in your right hand...

526
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,534
...you take two breaths from it,
and then you give it to your partner.

527
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:57,491
She takes two breaths from it,
and then you take it back...

528
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:01,039
...and you breathe into it twice.

529
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:05,416
On five, you blow out.
Don't hold her nose so tight.

530
00:53:05,594 --> 00:53:08,761
You have to close her nose,
but don't rip it off her face.

531
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:11,256
And keep your hand on the back
of her neck.

532
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:14,885
If her airway closes,
she will not be able to breathe.

533
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:17,387
You're not taking this personally,
are you?

534
00:53:17,564 --> 00:53:18,975
Don't worry.
- Okay.

535
00:53:19,149 --> 00:53:21,189
Okay, that's it for this afternoon.

536
00:53:21,402 --> 00:53:25,945
Thank you for your participation.
You can all go. Thank you.

537
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:33,493
What's your name again?

538
00:53:33,664 --> 00:53:35,039
- Rennie.
- Rennie.

539
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:41,041
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just hanging out.

540
00:53:41,672 --> 00:53:43,629
Spending my money.

541
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:52,757
What are you looking at?

542
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:57,144
Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's just that
we spent most of the day in the pool...

543
00:53:57,312 --> 00:54:00,479
...and you come out looking like that
and I look like this.

544
00:54:00,649 --> 00:54:03,104
I just wondered why that is.

545
00:54:07,114 --> 00:54:09,439
You don't look bad.

546
00:54:09,616 --> 00:54:11,110
New suit might help, though.

547
00:54:11,326 --> 00:54:16,700
Oh, it's just the suit? Great.
I'm on a budget.

548
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,628
What?

549
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:27,794
What do you say we go up to my room,
have a couple of decent drinks?

550
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,213
All right.

551
00:54:34,015 --> 00:54:37,633
- You married or what?
- Nope.

552
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:41,728
Not at the moment.

553
00:54:42,774 --> 00:54:45,479
Thank you. Who's this?

554
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:47,360
You like that, do you?

555
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:50,732
Men that look like this,
you usually end up supporting.

556
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:56,779
His name's Paul Nuytten, and he owns
half a dozen hotels around the world.

557
00:54:56,955 --> 00:55:02,578
Does he have a brother? Cousin?
Young grandfather?

558
00:55:03,419 --> 00:55:06,171
He's having a party tonight.
Do you want to come?

559
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:07,833
What?

560
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:11,293
He's having a party tonight.
Do you want to come?

561
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:15,336
Oh, I can't. I left all my designer
stuff back in Chicago.

562
00:55:15,515 --> 00:55:19,049
Well, that's all right.
You can borrow something of mine.

563
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:27,808
Could I borrow your hair?

564
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:30,855
How about your hairdresser?

565
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:32,693
Sure.

566
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:43,620
- You look pretty.
Thanks.

567
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:45,453
- You gonna be okay?
- I think so.

568
00:55:45,628 --> 00:55:47,620
I'll catch you later.

569
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:52,625
Gin and tonic.

570
00:56:00,684 --> 00:56:02,428
Thank you.

571
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:45,602
Oh, I know this dress,
but who is the woman?

572
00:56:46,021 --> 00:56:49,604
Paul Nuytten, my new pal,
Jessica Bates.

573
00:56:49,775 --> 00:56:51,483
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Welcome.

574
00:56:51,652 --> 00:56:53,775
Thank you.
You have a beautiful home.

575
00:56:53,946 --> 00:56:55,819
Thank you.

576
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:00,657
Would you like to dance?

577
00:57:01,244 --> 00:57:05,574
No. Thanks.
I have new shoes.

578
00:57:26,895 --> 00:57:28,971
Mademoiselle.

579
00:57:29,189 --> 00:57:31,312
Thank you. What's your name?

580
00:57:31,524 --> 00:57:35,059
- Tran.
- Tran?

581
00:57:37,947 --> 00:57:39,607
Rennie.

582
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:45,450
Tonight you stay?

583
00:57:47,332 --> 00:57:50,286
You have a very busy day tomorrow.

584
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,749
You have to polish your boat...

585
00:57:53,588 --> 00:57:55,877
...hunt some wild boar.

586
00:57:59,427 --> 00:58:01,301
Oh, Paul.

587
00:58:02,764 --> 00:58:06,097
You have your little phone book,
lots of numbers.

588
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:12,772
Why do we keep having
this conversation?

589
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:15,522
It's you.

590
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:18,184
It's you I want.

591
00:58:24,327 --> 00:58:27,992
All you want is the woman
you haven't slept with.

592
00:58:28,498 --> 00:58:31,534
That's not the same as wanting me.

593
00:58:42,261 --> 00:58:43,969
Paul.

594
00:58:45,514 --> 00:58:47,388
I need a kiss.

595
00:59:22,635 --> 00:59:24,508
Fresh fish!

596
00:59:28,057 --> 00:59:31,888
Aku! Fresh aku! Aku!
Freshest fish!

597
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,098
- Fish! Fish!
That one.

598
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:40,149
- Two pounds.
Hey!

599
00:59:42,154 --> 00:59:44,727
I see you've caught your fish after all.

600
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:48,867
Oh, can't place my face, huh?
Forgetting is useful skill.

601
00:59:49,036 --> 00:59:52,535
- I could learn some of that some time.
- Take out your cigarettes.

602
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:55,375
Take out your cigarettes
and offer me one.

603
00:59:56,335 --> 01:00:00,379
No, thanks. This is federal government.
You don't wanna lose your license.

604
01:00:00,589 --> 01:00:02,795
Point. At the fish.

605
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,089
- Say thank you and goodbye.
- Thank you.

606
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:06,630
Goodbye.

607
01:00:14,436 --> 01:00:15,930
Who was that guy?

608
01:00:16,104 --> 01:00:19,354
He's a local, and he's asking me
if the fish is fresh.

609
01:00:25,614 --> 01:00:27,322
<i>- Hello?
Sara?</i>

610
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,859
- Yes?
- Sara, it's Catharine.

611
01:00:31,036 --> 01:00:34,820
- Petersen.
- Catharine!

612
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,367
It's been such a long time.
Are you all right?

613
01:00:38,585 --> 01:00:42,499
Well, I have a situation actually.

614
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:47,171
Apparently, there's been a woman
reporter asking questions about me...

615
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,003
...and Sam.

616
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,717
Has anyone like that been
around to see you?

617
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:56,801
<i>Well, yes. There was a young woman
by here about six months ago.</i>

618
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,475
But she was from
the federal government.

619
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:06,109
Listen, Sara, I really must go
right now...

620
01:01:06,279 --> 01:01:08,437
...but I'll phone you later to catch up.

621
01:01:08,615 --> 01:01:11,699
It's been a long time,
and I would like to keep in touch.

622
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,362
I'll talk to you later, bye.

623
01:04:40,408 --> 01:04:43,444
I'll do it. I'll do it!

624
01:04:44,996 --> 01:04:49,040
The goddamn gauge said half full.
How come there was no air in it?

625
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:53,618
I was supposed to check these things.

626
01:04:59,218 --> 01:05:02,753
If I was a little further out
or had my back turned...

627
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:06,431
You scared the shit out of me.

628
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:10,890
Thanks for not having your back turned.

629
01:05:41,009 --> 01:05:43,679
I'll be right down.

630
01:06:02,155 --> 01:06:03,947
Hey!

631
01:06:05,534 --> 01:06:08,107
You really like those things?

632
01:06:09,037 --> 01:06:11,611
My second husband was addicted.

633
01:06:11,832 --> 01:06:14,453
Second husband?
How many have you had?

634
01:06:14,626 --> 01:06:19,003
Lots. That's how I got rich.

635
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:22,259
Once wasn't enough to get rich?

636
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,840
Rich is hard.

637
01:06:25,887 --> 01:06:29,221
You never really figure
you're quite there.

638
01:06:29,808 --> 01:06:31,551
That sounds pretty romantic.

639
01:06:34,354 --> 01:06:35,932
Well...

640
01:06:37,065 --> 01:06:39,022
...I used to think of it as my job.

641
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:43,107
Making myself appealing.

642
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:46,903
I was a professional.

643
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:11,798
L... I loved every one of them.

644
01:07:15,019 --> 01:07:17,012
Deeply.

645
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:20,893
Honestly.

646
01:07:26,197 --> 01:07:28,355
It wouldn't have worked any other way.

647
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:38,206
You like him.

648
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:44,210
Paul. You like him.

649
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:50,550
Go for it.

650
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:53,678
He wants you to.

651
01:07:58,771 --> 01:08:01,096
He needs somebody now...

652
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:03,349
...who knows how to commit.

653
01:08:08,113 --> 01:08:11,897
They're arguing over some woman
named Pelé, like the soccer player.

654
01:08:12,076 --> 01:08:15,242
One argues that she's going
on the warpath on Tuesday.

655
01:08:15,412 --> 01:08:17,654
The other guy says,
"No, next Wednesday."

656
01:08:17,831 --> 01:08:19,907
Six guys got into the same argument...

657
01:08:20,084 --> 01:08:23,951
...like they all know the same woman.
- No, no. Pelé is a goddess.

658
01:08:24,129 --> 01:08:28,875
Goddess of devastation.
She lives in a volcano. Kilauea.

659
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:31,968
And every so often she makes fire.

660
01:08:32,137 --> 01:08:33,596
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

661
01:08:33,764 --> 01:08:35,922
- Coffee?
No.

662
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:39,219
Thank you.
You okay?

663
01:08:39,645 --> 01:08:43,345
I don't feel too well actually.
I think I'll go back to the hotel.

664
01:08:47,194 --> 01:08:49,732
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay.

665
01:08:55,577 --> 01:08:59,527
- I'll drive you home.
- Don't be ridiculous.

666
01:08:59,706 --> 01:09:01,995
It's only a headache.

667
01:09:03,627 --> 01:09:07,126
I'll call you tonight.
We'll do something tomorrow.

668
01:09:07,297 --> 01:09:12,754
Look, you and Jessie
go on with your afternoon. Okay?

669
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:15,304
And have a nice time.

670
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:47,123
Tran, did he work
for your family in Indochina?

671
01:09:47,378 --> 01:09:48,623
Huh?

672
01:09:49,255 --> 01:09:54,629
It's just that you and he seem so close.
Did he work for another family?

673
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,379
Your wife's?

674
01:10:00,308 --> 01:10:02,384
It's just that I sense...

675
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:05,302
She was killed.

676
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,887
She was only 19.

677
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:09,560
I'm sorry.

678
01:10:11,861 --> 01:10:14,613
And I'm sorry I made you think of it.

679
01:10:15,615 --> 01:10:20,241
It's a rare gift to see things
that others cannot.

680
01:10:20,953 --> 01:10:23,871
It drives some people away.

681
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:30,286
I don't think people like you to know
things before they're ready to tell you.

682
01:10:30,463 --> 01:10:33,998
So I should just learn
to keep my mouth shut.

683
01:10:39,639 --> 01:10:42,723
Won't you see some of the island?

684
01:10:45,686 --> 01:10:47,478
Yes, I'd like that.

685
01:11:12,046 --> 01:11:15,296
Why are you smiling?
- Because you have a look on your face.

686
01:11:15,466 --> 01:11:17,624
Look?
- Like you want to ask something...

687
01:11:17,801 --> 01:11:20,339
...then you don't.
You ought to just ask it.

688
01:11:20,512 --> 01:11:24,462
No, I was just thinking,
why hasn't this woman married?

689
01:11:24,642 --> 01:11:27,595
Attractive, intelligent.

690
01:11:27,978 --> 01:11:30,018
Very, very strong.

691
01:11:30,189 --> 01:11:33,059
- She is.
- She?

692
01:11:33,233 --> 01:11:35,060
But I'm talking about you.

693
01:11:37,237 --> 01:11:38,613
So...

694
01:11:38,781 --> 01:11:41,984
...what about you and men?

695
01:11:43,827 --> 01:11:45,238
Bad timing.

696
01:11:45,662 --> 01:11:48,497
Maybe a little bit of fear?

697
01:11:50,459 --> 01:11:52,416
Tell you something about that.

698
01:11:52,628 --> 01:11:54,751
It's very, very provocative.

699
01:13:03,406 --> 01:13:04,948
Such a strange place.

700
01:13:05,116 --> 01:13:08,615
The sap from the trees cools the lava.

701
01:13:11,706 --> 01:13:13,449
- Paul?
- Huh.

702
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:16,916
- About Rennie.
- I'm not with Rennie.

703
01:13:17,837 --> 01:13:19,794
I'm with you.

704
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:23,711
I can't compete with her.

705
01:13:23,885 --> 01:13:26,210
There is no necessity.

706
01:13:29,348 --> 01:13:35,517
I have to know whatever this is
is something honest and just for me.

707
01:13:36,272 --> 01:13:37,980
Look at me.

708
01:13:39,233 --> 01:13:41,107
Look at me.

709
01:13:43,154 --> 01:13:45,193
Decide.

710
01:14:09,722 --> 01:14:11,002
Here?

711
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:15,174
I mean, can we turn
out the lights or something?

712
01:14:47,467 --> 01:14:50,552
No knock? Come into
a person's office, no knock?

713
01:14:50,721 --> 01:14:52,049
I'm sorry.

714
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:56,968
I knock. I come to your office, I knock.
Where were you born, anyway?

715
01:14:57,144 --> 01:15:00,477
- Wisconsin. Should I come back later?
- No.

716
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:04,230
Too late to come back later.
You already no knock.

717
01:15:04,401 --> 01:15:06,310
What you want, Wisconsin?

718
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:10,188
Mr. Shin, my name is Rennie Walker.

719
01:15:13,076 --> 01:15:16,113
This woman befriended me.

720
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:19,414
And now I think she's seeing my fiancé.

721
01:15:23,211 --> 01:15:24,789
I really must know.

722
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:28,872
No, no, no. I no do this kind of work.
Not respectable.

723
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:33,006
Mr. Shin, I'll tell you
two things about me.

724
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:35,670
I'm very rich.

725
01:15:37,517 --> 01:15:39,842
And I'm very wealthy.

726
01:17:11,944 --> 01:17:15,894
I'm sorry about Jessie.
I thought it was what you wanted.

727
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,072
Do you understand, Rennie?

728
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,916
Long drive back.

729
01:17:30,963 --> 01:17:33,039
Fix me a drink?

730
01:17:56,822 --> 01:17:59,906
Rennie? Rennie?

731
01:18:01,493 --> 01:18:05,076
Come in. I want you to.

732
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:08,616
Why tonight, after all this time?

733
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:09,948
Huh?

734
01:18:11,461 --> 01:18:14,498
I think we've waited long enough.

735
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:28,902
Just a minute.

736
01:19:33,292 --> 01:19:36,910
- Morning.
- Good morning.

737
01:19:44,929 --> 01:19:48,629
You left this in the Jeep
the other day.

738
01:19:48,808 --> 01:19:52,508
So you drove all the way
over just to deliver a sweater?

739
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,596
No. Not exactly.

740
01:19:55,648 --> 01:19:59,942
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

741
01:20:03,656 --> 01:20:05,483
I have something to tell you.

742
01:20:06,867 --> 01:20:08,860
Is something wrong?

743
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:12,574
Last night, Rennie and I,
we decided to marry.

744
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:24,005
I want you to be okay with this.

745
01:20:25,886 --> 01:20:28,175
I'll be okay.

746
01:21:01,129 --> 01:21:03,620
I'll be out there in a minute.

747
01:21:10,055 --> 01:21:11,514
Woman in love.

748
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:18,012
- Do you really doubt it?
- No. I helped you get here, didn't I?

749
01:21:18,438 --> 01:21:21,439
When you put us together,
it made him want you more.

750
01:21:21,608 --> 01:21:24,941
So I guess you could say my
wedding gift was the groom.

751
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:29,863
I meant it as an exchange of gifts.

752
01:21:30,909 --> 01:21:34,242
Something you could take
with you from your time with Paul.

753
01:21:34,412 --> 01:21:38,280
Well, in that case, I still owe you one.

754
01:21:41,336 --> 01:21:44,456
- That was a beautiful ceremony.
- Thank you.

755
01:21:44,631 --> 01:21:47,122
It was a lovely ceremony.

756
01:21:48,051 --> 01:21:49,675
Open it.

757
01:21:51,346 --> 01:21:54,347
Whatever this is, it means a lot to me.

758
01:22:10,657 --> 01:22:12,945
Black widow.

759
01:22:14,494 --> 01:22:16,782
She mates and she kills.

760
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:22,494
Your question is, does she love?

761
01:22:23,753 --> 01:22:26,956
It's impossible to answer that...

762
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:30,083
...unless you live in her world.

763
01:22:36,349 --> 01:22:39,219
Such an intriguing gift.

764
01:22:44,857 --> 01:22:47,858
Makes me wish I had
more to share with you.

765
01:22:50,071 --> 01:22:54,697
- Truth is, I'm sorry it's over.
- The truth is, it's not over yet.

766
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:00,490
Till then.

767
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:07,037
With your permission, may I have
the pleasure to kiss the lovely bride?

768
01:23:32,112 --> 01:23:33,939
Come in.

769
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,778
Hey, Wisconsin, you knock.
I no recognize you.

770
01:23:42,247 --> 01:23:45,912
- Do you have my pictures?
- Sure.

771
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:51,418
Hey, I see you got married
a little while ago. Congratulations.

772
01:23:53,425 --> 01:23:55,998
Good stuff, huh?

773
01:24:05,395 --> 01:24:09,227
What else do you have
in your desk, Mr. Shin?

774
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:14,394
What do you mean by that? I got a lot
of stuff. I got paper clips. I got menthol.

775
01:24:14,571 --> 01:24:19,316
Condoms even, not it any your
business. Why you ask?

776
01:24:19,785 --> 01:24:23,699
Because you have a choice, Mr. Shin.
You can die or you can die happy.

777
01:24:23,914 --> 01:24:27,329
- Why are you doing this?
- It's in the second drawer. Look!

778
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,078
You have five seconds.

779
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:35,625
- One...
- Please.

780
01:24:36,092 --> 01:24:38,168
...two...
- Wait! Wait!

781
01:24:39,721 --> 01:24:41,548
- Hold on.
...three...

782
01:24:48,354 --> 01:24:49,683
<i>... four.</i>

783
01:24:50,982 --> 01:24:53,651
Hyland, let me see that needle.

784
01:24:55,904 --> 01:24:58,276
Get it to the lab.

785
01:24:58,490 --> 01:25:01,325
- Make sure they don't move anything.
- Okay.

786
01:25:06,289 --> 01:25:08,495
I want the whole room dusted.

787
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:11,537
<i>Anything here for the Herald?
Or just a nothing OD?</i>

788
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:14,416
If it gets exciting,
I'll find your number.

789
01:25:18,009 --> 01:25:19,966
Now who would you be?

790
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:49,700
I'm glad you came over, Paul.
I need to talk to you.

791
01:25:49,874 --> 01:25:52,579
Don't you think Rennie
left a bit abruptly?

792
01:25:52,752 --> 01:25:57,746
No. Just her usual trip. She sees
her accountant on the mainland.

793
01:25:57,923 --> 01:25:59,667
Investments.

794
01:26:02,678 --> 01:26:05,714
Paul, how well do you
think you know me?

795
01:26:06,098 --> 01:26:07,129
Know you?

796
01:26:10,519 --> 01:26:13,520
- A little bit, I guess.
- Would I ever lie to you?

797
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:16,566
- I don't know.
- Well, I did.

798
01:26:17,192 --> 01:26:19,315
My name is not Jessica Bates.

799
01:26:19,486 --> 01:26:22,357
It's Alex Barnes.
I work for the Justice Department.

800
01:26:25,326 --> 01:26:27,995
Your wife's name
is not Rennie either.

801
01:26:28,162 --> 01:26:31,495
Only, no one seems to know
what her real name is.

802
01:26:31,665 --> 01:26:33,741
- Listen to me.
- This makes no sense.

803
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:38,663
Under three different names, she married
three different men. All wealthy men.

804
01:26:38,881 --> 01:26:42,047
- What are you trying to do?
- Paul, she killed all of them.

805
01:26:42,217 --> 01:26:47,342
She poisoned them. She's left town and
that's when they die, when she's gone.

806
01:26:51,602 --> 01:26:55,434
But she doesn't need my money.
I've seen her portfolio. Bank accounts...

807
01:26:55,606 --> 01:26:58,606
I just told you how she got them.

808
01:27:00,611 --> 01:27:03,979
- I know it sounds like I used you.
- Sounds like?

809
01:27:05,115 --> 01:27:07,606
You can't say that you
didn't know how I felt.

810
01:27:07,784 --> 01:27:11,699
That was Jessie, not some cop.

811
01:27:12,873 --> 01:27:18,377
Look, lady, don't feel so bad.
Everybody uses everybody.

812
01:27:20,464 --> 01:27:22,955
Only she does it better, right?

813
01:27:23,133 --> 01:27:26,300
That's what it is, isn't it?
She does it better.

814
01:27:26,469 --> 01:27:30,135
- No, that isn't it.
- And I told myself you could handle it.

815
01:27:30,307 --> 01:27:33,722
- I did!
- Then maybe you can explain our wills.

816
01:27:33,893 --> 01:27:38,223
They leave everything...
Everything to the Cancer Foundation.

817
01:27:38,398 --> 01:27:42,098
Nothing to each other.
It was her idea.

818
01:27:42,277 --> 01:27:45,480
Sound like the woman
you're talking about?

819
01:27:46,364 --> 01:27:48,156
Answer me!

820
01:27:54,038 --> 01:27:57,075
Tell me there is no jealousy.

821
01:27:58,668 --> 01:28:01,159
No jealousy at all.

822
01:28:24,235 --> 01:28:27,734
They said he strangled
in his sleep or something.

823
01:28:31,284 --> 01:28:33,988
Do you know a woman named
Jessica Bates?

824
01:28:34,704 --> 01:28:36,661
I do.

825
01:28:36,831 --> 01:28:41,125
It seems Miss Bates
is a federal agent named Barnes.

826
01:28:41,502 --> 01:28:46,247
And Miss Barnes believes
that you murdered Mr. Nuytten.

827
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:50,219
Paul died last night.

828
01:28:50,386 --> 01:28:54,086
I was in San Francisco.
You can call the hotel.

829
01:28:54,306 --> 01:28:56,216
She thinks you poisoned him.

830
01:28:56,392 --> 01:28:59,808
Something that would take delayed
effect while he slept.

831
01:29:05,025 --> 01:29:07,433
- Did you check our home for the poison?
- No.

832
01:29:07,653 --> 01:29:10,773
There's no probable cause for a warrant.

833
01:29:10,948 --> 01:29:15,111
- I thought you might voluntarily...
- Of course. Yes.

834
01:29:15,286 --> 01:29:17,444
Check everything you want.

835
01:29:20,082 --> 01:29:22,620
And while you're at it...

836
01:29:23,085 --> 01:29:27,581
...Jessica Bates,
or whatever her name is...

837
01:29:28,424 --> 01:29:33,251
...was my husband's lover.
Before and after the wedding.

838
01:29:34,346 --> 01:29:37,715
So while you're searching my home...

839
01:29:40,018 --> 01:29:41,394
Interesting.

840
01:29:41,562 --> 01:29:45,974
We learned that he went to her
apartment yesterday afternoon.

841
01:30:23,478 --> 01:30:25,637
Please, have a seat.

842
01:30:27,524 --> 01:30:29,896
You've been more than kind...

843
01:30:30,318 --> 01:30:32,988
...after what you've been through.

844
01:30:35,115 --> 01:30:38,649
Listen, we did find a toxic compound
in Miss Barnes' apartment.

845
01:30:40,036 --> 01:30:42,871
Delayed-action poison.

846
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:45,447
Also, we have certain photographs.

847
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,250
Photos of Miss Barnes
and your husband.

848
01:30:53,425 --> 01:30:57,885
Those pictures are all my fault. I...

849
01:30:59,681 --> 01:31:03,180
I hired this horrid little man.

850
01:31:04,269 --> 01:31:05,811
How did you get them?

851
01:31:06,354 --> 01:31:08,927
The man you hired
is dead, Mrs. Nuytten.

852
01:31:09,107 --> 01:31:12,606
We assumed of an accidental
overdose of heroin.

853
01:31:13,528 --> 01:31:17,857
Now I'm afraid Miss Barnes has more
than just your husband to answer for.

854
01:31:21,994 --> 01:31:23,738
How well did you know him?

855
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:28,955
Back as far as you can.

856
01:31:30,962 --> 01:31:34,128
Did you know Paul Nuytten?
Were you having a love affair?

857
01:31:35,007 --> 01:31:40,002
Mrs. Nuytten, the Cancer Foundation
flew Mr. Foster to the islands...

858
01:31:40,179 --> 01:31:43,844
...because we seem to have...
Well, something of a situation.

859
01:31:44,016 --> 01:31:48,394
- A situation?
- Yes, it's concerning Mr. Nuytten's will.

860
01:31:48,562 --> 01:31:52,856
It seems that Mr. Nuytten's legal
residence is the state of Florida.

861
01:31:53,025 --> 01:31:54,852
Were you aware of that?

862
01:31:55,027 --> 01:31:56,569
No. Should I be?

863
01:31:57,029 --> 01:32:01,738
Florida has a so-called mortmain
statute, Mrs. Nuytten.

864
01:32:02,118 --> 01:32:07,242
Any bequest to charity in a will
executed within six months of death...

865
01:32:07,414 --> 01:32:09,621
...can be invalidated by the spouse.

866
01:32:12,837 --> 01:32:14,913
- How interesting.
Of course...

867
01:32:15,089 --> 01:32:18,540
...it's no requirement
that you invalidate the gift.

868
01:32:19,718 --> 01:32:24,427
Shortly before his death,
Mr. Foster, my husband...

869
01:32:24,598 --> 01:32:28,133
...expressed reservations
about your organization.

870
01:32:30,437 --> 01:32:33,723
Profound reservations.

871
01:32:43,492 --> 01:32:47,821
Miss Barnes called from the jail.

872
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:54,825
I tell her you plan to take long trip.

873
01:33:55,105 --> 01:33:57,430
Treating you...?

874
01:33:58,650 --> 01:34:00,025
You okay?

875
01:34:01,945 --> 01:34:04,233
I can't complain.

876
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:08,861
It's a lot of psychological tests.

877
01:34:09,661 --> 01:34:12,496
Which I find surprising
for a crime of passion.

878
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:18,330
Not so surprising.

879
01:34:19,504 --> 01:34:23,916
Well, they don't seem to think
your only motive was jealousy.

880
01:34:25,843 --> 01:34:27,635
Not of Paul, anyway.

881
01:34:28,513 --> 01:34:32,261
They seem to think
your obsession was...

882
01:34:33,726 --> 01:34:35,220
...with me.

883
01:34:35,937 --> 01:34:39,270
They think you started out as
an ambitious federal agent...

884
01:34:41,317 --> 01:34:44,686
...and you became obsessed by this...

885
01:34:45,738 --> 01:34:47,731
...phantom.

886
01:34:48,407 --> 01:34:50,483
And then...

887
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,153
...you chased her...

888
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,657
...and you chased her...

889
01:34:57,249 --> 01:35:01,377
...and when you thought you'd
never be quick enough to catch her...

890
01:35:01,545 --> 01:35:03,372
I killed him...

891
01:35:03,756 --> 01:35:05,748
...to frame you.

892
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:35,241
How did you manage it?

893
01:35:35,412 --> 01:35:38,366
What, did you leave town
and sneak back?

894
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:43,201
Did you use the same bottle
you put in my place?

895
01:35:43,378 --> 01:35:47,672
You always did have a tendency
to over-think things.

896
01:35:48,383 --> 01:35:53,211
The most important thing about figuring
anything out is knowing when to stop.

897
01:36:00,103 --> 01:36:02,143
You know...

898
01:36:03,649 --> 01:36:07,516
...of all the relationships
I'll look back on...

899
01:36:07,694 --> 01:36:09,936
...in 50 years' time...

900
01:36:14,117 --> 01:36:17,866
...I'll always remember this one.

901
01:36:37,265 --> 01:36:38,973
Hello, Sara.

902
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:43,312
It's good to see you.

903
01:37:11,883 --> 01:37:15,216
I put the poison in Paul's brandy.
You mustn't...

904
01:37:15,386 --> 01:37:17,712
We know. We found it before he did.

905
01:38:26,915 --> 01:38:28,659
Get your cameras, she's here!

906
01:38:28,834 --> 01:38:33,579
Congratulations, that was a brilliant trap.
Are you going back to Washington now?

907
01:38:33,756 --> 01:38:36,081
Were you tipped off
she was here in Hawaii?

908
01:38:36,258 --> 01:38:38,251
Please, give us an answer for the press.

909
01:38:38,427 --> 01:38:41,381
Are you going to testify at the trial?

910
01:38:44,933 --> 01:38:47,140
I will give you the statement.
