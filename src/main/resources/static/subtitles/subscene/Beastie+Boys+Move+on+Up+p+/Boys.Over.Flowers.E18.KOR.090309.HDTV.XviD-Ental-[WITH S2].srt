Episode 18

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,158
What?

6
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:49,207
- Let go.
- I don't want to.

7
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:50,987
I'm not letting go.

8
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:52,657
Hey, Monkey.

9
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:01,236
Okay. You call me "Monkey",
so I really want to become a monkey.

10
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,956
Even if it's the only way,
I really want to cling to you forever.

11
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:16,237
The man who is right for you...

12
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:18,786
...is out there somewhere.

13
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:21,252
You...

14
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:25,067
...aren't so ugly.

15
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,813
I don't want someone else.

16
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:30,142
If he's not Gu Jun Pyo, then he won't do.

17
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,047
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,394
Is there someone you like?

19
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,487
Yeah.

20
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:50,921
Aren't you going to ask who it is?

21
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:56,807
I don't want to hear.

22
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:59,022
I don't want to hear anything.
I can't hear a thing.

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,326
I don't hear anything.

25
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:50,966
Did you see a ghost?

26
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:54,400
N-no!

27
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,901
I-I didn't see anything.

28
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:59,483
I really didn't see anything.

29
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:02,823
Let's go.

30
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:03,995
Where to?

31
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,449
If I leave you alone,

32
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:08,019
You're going to jump in the water again.

33
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:33,512
This stupid thing won't stop. 
Why am I like this?

34
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:47,776
It's not stupid.

35
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:49,580
So...

36
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:52,404
Don't scold it too much.

37
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:24,185
Why Macau of all places?

38
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,094
I came to find someone.

39
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,279
Ah! Your boyfriend?

40
00:05:31,546 --> 00:05:33,397
Yeah, well...

41
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:23,575
<i>Gu Jun Pyo</i>

42
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:30,085
<i>I'm leaving first.</i>

43
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:01,419
Song Woo Bin.

44
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:03,214
You better hurry and get down from there!

45
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,276
Hey, So Yi Jung.

46
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,496
Why are you my friend?

47
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:08,858
What?

48
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,587
Tell me the truth.

49
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:16,714
It's embarrassing to have me,
son of the mafia, as a friend, right?

50
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:20,228
Stop talking nonsense and
get down from there now!

51
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:26,081
I'm embarrassed, so I can only
imagine what it must be like for you.

52
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,623
It's because of you I get by.

53
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,207
The others from "great" families
don't even consider me a person,

54
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,374
even I know that.

55
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:40,314
Song Woo Bin, you really...

56
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,535
But, I'm...

57
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:48,204
...only embarrassed in front of you guys.

58
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:52,599
My boss...my path...

59
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:55,825
I don't care what others say,

60
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:59,670
but to you, in front of you,

61
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:03,388
I'm occasionally embarrassed.

62
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:08,825
I get so annoyed for being embarrassed.

63
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:13,248
Did you know that? Did you even know that?!

64
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,911
You jerk!

65
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:20,451
To you,

66
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,733
is that all we mean to you?!

67
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,200
Do you think we're better off than you?!

68
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:29,890
If you're like this, then what about me? Us?

69
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:35,047
If you're embarrassed once in a while,
can't you show that to your friends?

70
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:36,701
Is that so?

71
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:41,266
Does that really make us friends?
Brothers? F4?!

72
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,249
Tell me, you bastard!

73
00:10:58,151 --> 00:10:59,922
Oh my.

74
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:09,671
Hey, what do you think you're doing there?

75
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,681
Get lost!

76
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:37,796
Yi Jung.

77
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:39,891
Why did you drink so much?

78
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:41,253
Ah.

79
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:44,442
Yi Jung, are you okay?

80
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:48,081
Master, should we take care of this?

81
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:50,065
Don't interfere.

82
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:54,443
I'll take care of the bastards
who hurt my friend myself.

83
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:07,566
Do you know how much his hands are worth?

84
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:09,158
I don't know.

85
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:12,409
Even if I can come back in life,
I wouldn't exchange for his hands.

86
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,445
Do you have any idea what you've done?!

87
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:29,290
Just hang in there.

88
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:46,272
Good morning!

89
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,552
Did you sleep well too, Unni?

90
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,552
I couldn't sleep a wink.

91
00:12:56,802 --> 00:13:00,522
Last night was a historical night
for Gu Jun Pyo and Ha Jae Kyung.

92
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:03,459
Jun Pyo was embarrassed, so he left first.

93
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:19,503
Things looked good between you two yesterday.

94
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:22,592
See. It was a good idea to come here, right?

95
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,232
Just like how a thread follows a needle,
I'll get going too.

96
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,234
You two have fun and come back later.

97
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:35,562
Ji Hoo, please take care of Jan Di, okay?

98
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:39,157
Uh, Unni, we too...

99
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:07,335
[Yoon Ji Hoo]

100
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,713
[Geum Jan Di / Prayer for acceptance]

101
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:30,195
[Yoon Ji Hoo / Prayer for constant happiness]

102
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,208
Supposedly, you'll get accepted if you drink this.

103
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:17,123
She has a good face.

104
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:23,312
The young lady's face can make muddy water clear.

105
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:27,499
Be sure to treasure her.

106
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,960
What?

107
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,893
That girl will give you a family.

108
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:59,075
How come I don't see that young girl today?

109
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:03,638
Grandmother, that child doesn't work here.

110
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,759
Of course she's not a child.

111
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,731
She's a grown woman.

112
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:10,507
I adore her to pieces.

113
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:12,050
Ah, yes.

114
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:16,771
If I had a grandson, I'd love to make
her my granddaughter-in-law.

115
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,050
No, that's not possible

116
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:22,299
since she has already been taken by someone.

117
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:26,661
Now, please be careful.

118
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,651
Have a safe trip home.

119
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:25,371
I'm back...

120
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:32,765
Mom, what is all this?

121
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,732
Was there a war?

122
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,922
Jan Di, sit down.

123
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,529
We have an important announcement to make.

124
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,780
An announcement?

125
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:49,700
Geum Jan Di, my eldest.

126
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,153
Listen well to what I'm about to say, okay?

127
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,141
What is it this time?

128
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:57,059
Dad, you got into trouble again, right?!

129
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,333
You think I get into trouble all the time...

130
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:01,795
You're right.

131
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:03,024
So...

132
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,767
in order to remove the source of the problem,

133
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:08,626
I've made a crucial decision.

134
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:11,343
Decision?

135
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:13,514
Yeah.

136
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,841
Tomorrow morning,

137
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:21,716
Mom and Dad have decided to
head to where your uncle lives.

138
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:23,436
What?

139
00:19:23,506 --> 00:19:25,884
It's hard enough getting by.

140
00:19:26,523 --> 00:19:28,988
There is no hope for our family here.

141
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:32,835
Mom and Dad will head down
and work on fishing boats,

142
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:37,460
and we can send you money for living expenses.

143
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,877
It won't cost us anything if we go there.

144
00:19:40,043 --> 00:19:42,816
But what about Kang San and me?

145
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,413
You have to stay here and attend school.

146
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:49,729
Geum Jan Di, take good care of San.

147
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:53,337
From now on, you are the head of our family.

148
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:57,476
Was there ever a time
when Noona wasn't the head?

149
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:00,033
Come on, Mom.

150
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:01,707
Dad.

151
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:05,084
I'm sorry, Jan Di.

152
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,519
Listen to your big sister.

153
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:10,708
Make sure to wash properly, and...

154
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:15,472
Oh, my poor baby.

155
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:30,695
- Hey.
- Yes?

156
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,134
What's going on?

157
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,708
Well, that is...

158
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:38,623
<i>Give that to me.</i>

159
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:40,729
<i>And this one...</i>

160
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:45,643
Hey, Monkey.

161
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:48,000
What are you doing in someone else's house?

162
00:20:51,302 --> 00:20:53,169
Oh, my husband is awake?
You're hungry, right?

163
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:55,443
Let's eat breakfast.

164
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:02,448
Here, have a seat.

165
00:21:08,627 --> 00:21:10,462
What's all this?

166
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:13,371
What do you think it is?
I prepared this for you.

167
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,073
We have chefs in my house.

168
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:19,822
I know, but there isn't anything
I can do for you even if I want to.

169
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:24,649
You and I are similar. What we want,
we buy and we get everything.

170
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:28,495
So I thought what if it was me.

171
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,993
I thought, "What do I long for the most?"

172
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:35,163
What was it?

173
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,179
First of all, I wanted a happy,
fulfilling breakfast table.

174
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:43,892
I hated eating by myself at a huge table.

175
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:03,484
Since you prepared it, I will eat it, but-

176
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,925
Really? Then, start by eating this.

177
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:08,718
This is really good. This is good, too.

178
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:11,686
This one, this one.

179
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:13,484
Try this one.

180
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,549
Alright, before it cools down,

181
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:27,066
you have to eat it while it's warm.

182
00:22:30,504 --> 00:22:35,610
I was really happy when someone
boned the fish and put it on my rice.

183
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:38,142
You've never done this, right?

184
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:49,831
Is it good?

185
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:54,769
That's a relief.

186
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:57,112
Eat this also.

187
00:22:57,745 --> 00:22:59,736
And this one too.

188
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:03,815
Do you want to try this?

189
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,949
*Ya Shim Jak.

190
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:05,949
{\a6}*Ya Shim Jak means a masterpiece

191
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:08,808
Have some roots too.

192
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:11,403
After this, there's dessert.

193
00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:15,043
Have you tried the soup?
I made it really delicious.

194
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:25,653
Is there anything?

195
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:27,546
No.

196
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:30,342
Of course there isn't.

197
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:33,385
A place with no deposit, cheap rent.

198
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,962
Decent enough for a junior high
and high school student to live...

199
00:23:36,276 --> 00:23:37,823
Of course there isn't.

200
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:42,055
Can't you just come to
my house and live with me?

201
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:44,749
What about Kang San?

202
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:48,515
Oh, yeah. There's Geum Kang San.

203
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,173
There's no answer.

204
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:58,156
I'd better get going.

205
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:02,280
You're the one who needs help.

206
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:11,315
Have some tea.

207
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:15,017
How's your shoulder?

208
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:20,878
It's better now, but now my knee is aching.

209
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:25,503
I'll get a hot pack for your knee.

210
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:30,252
Where did such a sweetie come from?

211
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:35,798
What is this?

212
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,205
You're looking for a room?

213
00:24:41,032 --> 00:24:44,650
Yes. I'm looking for a cheap place,
but it's not easy.

214
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:45,947
Wait a moment.

215
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:48,633
- I'll get you a hot pack for your knee.
- No. No.

216
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:13,082
When did you get in here?

217
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:23,740
Here.

218
00:25:23,957 --> 00:25:25,174
What is it?

219
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,190
It's late, but it's our engagement gift.

220
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:34,132
Gift?

221
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,912
The one the parents got is not my style.

222
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:41,989
But I really wanted to share
this with you, so I made it.

223
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,039
J J?

224
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:56,853
Yeah. Jun Pyo and Jae Kyung.

225
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,054
No. Jae Kyung and Jun Pyo.

226
00:25:59,354 --> 00:26:01,604
Even our initials are fated, right?

227
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,387
Put it on for me.

228
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:26,059
Where are you going?

229
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:28,918
I have to go somewhere.

230
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:30,326
Where?

231
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:33,200
You're my fiancée, not my wife!

232
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,773
Just go home!

233
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:19,320
Stop it.

234
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:21,176
No, I'll do what I want.

235
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:02,616
It's really fascinating.

236
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,620
How can something like this
be made from regular dirt?

237
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:09,099
You're more fascinating.

238
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,479
What kind of girl who has no other
interest aside from pottery?

239
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,028
Then what about you?

240
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:18,009
Is there something you like more than pottery?

241
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:19,647
There is.

242
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:22,024
A girl?

243
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:27,086
Hm. Girls are like math problems.

244
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:31,741
In the beginning, I wonder how to solve it.

245
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:36,370
After I study and follow through,
there's a solution.

246
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:41,022
It's simple, but it's still a wonder.

247
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,087
Why are you looking at me like that?

248
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:55,446
To me, you're...

249
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:58,616
like a problem with no solution.

250
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,008
What?

251
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:08,930
A problem that starts off
completely twisted and unsolvable.

252
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:11,773
Hey, you'd better come here.

253
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,583
Jung.

254
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:40,829
Why did you act like that?

255
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:43,394
According to Woo Bin, your hand...

256
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,083
It's over.

257
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,802
Seriously?

258
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,489
The swimmer had to give up
swimming because of a bum shoulder

259
00:31:54,956 --> 00:32:01,103
The potter has to give up
pottery because of a broken hand.

260
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:07,240
Doesn't it seem like some documentary
about overcoming obstacles?

261
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:11,133
What's that supposed mean?

262
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:15,799
Are you talking about Geum Jan Di?

263
00:32:17,553 --> 00:32:22,208
Is there any other swimmer
we know besides Geum Jan Di?

264
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:24,683
So Yi Jung.

265
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:26,395
Be straight with me.

266
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:29,432
What do you mean by a bum shoulder?

267
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:33,305
Was this what you were talking about in Macau?

268
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,500
Come to think of it,

269
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,958
you really came to your senses in Macau.

270
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:47,499
For people like us,

271
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,904
stuff like love or innocence was
never meant to be from the start.

272
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:55,064
I told you to tell it to me straight!

273
00:32:58,006 --> 00:33:01,199
Do you remember when she
got hit by the chair meant for you?

274
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:06,607
You don't know how much Geum Jan Di cried

275
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,489
after hearing she couldn't swim anymore, do you?

276
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:17,487
Is that...really true?

277
00:33:19,504 --> 00:33:21,750
No matter how you tackle it,

278
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:27,745
the result is always the same.

279
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:36,128
People like you and I have nothing
to give the women we love but pain.

280
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:09,608
Here, Kang San. Right here.

281
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:15,456
Will you be okay?

282
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,658
- Just the two of you here...
- It's okay.

283
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:21,439
The view is great and it's cozy too.
Right, Noona?

284
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:24,093
Thanks Ga Eul.

285
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:25,586
It's getting really late.

286
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:29,813
- I'll leave then.
- Thanks!

287
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:32,108
- Kang San, bye!
- Go home safely!

288
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,714
Kang San, will you be okay?

289
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:44,437
Just don't overdo it yourself.

290
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,052
Let's do our best, so Mom and Dad
won't have to worry.

291
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:51,479
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

292
00:34:53,577 --> 00:34:55,300
Let's start now.

293
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,076
Start cleaning!

294
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,100
- Noona, over there.
- Let's get started.

295
00:35:01,508 --> 00:35:03,119
Here?

296
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:31,546
Whose fault was it that
Geum Jan Di can't swim anymore?

297
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,198
Why aren't you swimming?

298
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:34,850
I quit.

299
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,607
Why would a swimmer quit swimming?

300
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:38,260
It's none of your business.

301
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:08,728
While I'm gone, please take care of Jun Pyo.

302
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,851
Do you understand what I mean?

303
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,735
I understand.

304
00:36:15,527 --> 00:36:19,294
If anything out of the ordinary,
contact me right away.

305
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:21,533
Don't worry and have a safe trip.

306
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,378
Hey, delivery girl!

307
00:38:44,578 --> 00:38:46,201
Give me a milk carton.

308
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,472
Hurry and toss over my milk.

309
00:38:52,602 --> 00:38:53,936
Jun Pyo hyung-nim?

310
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:57,909
Hey, Gu Jun Pyo!
What are you doing here?

311
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,200
Why?

312
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,270
Is it strange seeing me at my own house?

313
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:02,423
Your house?

314
00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:04,892
I decided today that I'll live here.

315
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:08,179
Why?

316
00:39:08,296 --> 00:39:10,139
Why would you live here?

317
00:39:20,812 --> 00:39:22,687
To experience being independent.

318
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:24,483
Should I call it ‘standing on my own'?

319
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:27,270
Why would you do something like that here?

320
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,230
Don't you ever watch dramas?

321
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:32,243
Usually for thoughtful royal family or clans,

322
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,832
the heirs must go through trainings like this.

323
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:39,083
Haven't you heard stories about
sons being thrown off a cliff?

324
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:41,319
Where was it...

325
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:44,295
S... S....

326
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:46,819
- Sparta?
- Yes! There!

327
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:52,992
Hey little bro, don't just study for yourself,
but help your sister study too.

328
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:57,028
I can't communicate with her, because
she lacks common knowledge of 'Su Sa'*

329
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:57,028
<i>{\a6}*Su Sa means investigation. (Jun Pyo said wrong word)</i>

330
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:58,429
Common knowledge of 'Su Sa'?

331
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:00,697
Common knowledge of 'Shi Sa'*

332
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:00,697
<i>{\a6}*Shi Sa means current affairs</i>

333
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:06,478
Whether it's standing on your own or
being independent, can you leave now?

334
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,511
We are a bit busy.

335
00:40:15,138 --> 00:40:16,307
What's this?

336
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:20,252
It wasn't planned, but we're neighbors now.

337
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,722
I hope we can help each other out.

338
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,628
If you need anything, I'll help.

339
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:29,634
Can I refuse?

340
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:11,339
What I just showed you is the spinning wheel method
and what everyone is doing is the coiling method.

341
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:19,700
<i>Pay attention to the details, please.</i>

342
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:25,591
Okay, that's it for today.

343
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:28,359
You all did a good job!

344
00:41:42,537 --> 00:41:44,221
Just confess to him.

345
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:45,972
Huh?

346
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:50,786
Ga Eul, tell him before it's too late.

347
00:41:52,283 --> 00:41:53,814
It's just that...

348
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,095
I'm afraid.

349
00:42:00,004 --> 00:42:02,889
He's very different from me.

350
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:09,287
Love doesn't work if you hold back.

351
00:42:09,603 --> 00:42:13,004
And it won't remain hidden
even if you try to hide it.

352
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:20,409
So...why did you break up with that person?

353
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,929
I wanted to stay with him,
the way he wanted me to.

354
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,464
But I couldn't.

355
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:37,237
I kept wanting more and it became too hard.

356
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:40,817
Did you confess your feelings to him?

357
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:42,835
I don't know.

358
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,987
Did I confess?

359
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,400
If you don't want to regret it later like me,

360
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:52,103
how about trying to be more courageous?

361
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,594
What is all this?

362
00:43:03,944 --> 00:43:05,107
<i>Hey!</i>

363
00:43:05,528 --> 00:43:07,568
<i>Why does a student come home so late?</i>

364
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:10,920
When school's over, you should
hurry up and come home.

365
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,406
Hey!

366
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:15,557
Did you bring all this here?

367
00:43:15,805 --> 00:43:17,282
Oh, this?

368
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:21,112
I couldn't use it all
so I threw it away here.

369
00:43:21,787 --> 00:43:23,226
Threw it away?

370
00:43:29,714 --> 00:43:31,250
Anyway...

371
00:43:32,073 --> 00:43:33,697
What's this smell?

372
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:53,149
Let's eat, let's eat, let's eat.

373
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:57,323
It looks so good.

374
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:01,703
Kang San, blow on it because it's hot.

375
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,639
What? Why?

376
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,428
Yours looks tastier.

377
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:21,053
I didn't cook it separately.

378
00:44:21,276 --> 00:44:23,241
It's the same as that.

379
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:25,115
Give that to me.

380
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:28,900
Hurry up and hand it over!

381
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:29,806
Hey.

382
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,707
Hey. No!

383
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,042
This is so good!

384
00:45:04,255 --> 00:45:06,322
Little brother, isn't there anymore?

385
00:45:09,462 --> 00:45:13,194
I only ate one chopstick full because of you.

386
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:17,444
Hey, you guys are keeping this
delicious food all to yourselves?

387
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:19,771
That's a petty way to treat your neighbor.

388
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:20,989
Are you done eating?

389
00:45:21,295 --> 00:45:23,389
Then leave. Go!

390
00:45:26,178 --> 00:45:29,162
Little brother, do you have any more ramen?

391
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:38,883
What's up?

392
00:45:38,884 --> 00:45:41,413
I don't like visitors coming over without a purpose.

393
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:46,196
I have a purpose.

394
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:50,618
Will you...

395
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:53,853
Will you go out on a date with me?

396
00:45:58,372 --> 00:45:59,880
Date?

397
00:46:00,655 --> 00:46:02,728
We did that before.

398
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:07,632
Not a fake one, but a real date.

399
00:46:10,383 --> 00:46:13,728
Miss Ga Eul, did something shocking happen to you?

400
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:15,902
Or...

401
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:17,731
Did you get dumped by another guy?

402
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:19,538
I'm not kidding.

403
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:23,451
I...

404
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:27,313
I like you, Yi Jung sunbae.

405
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:40,255
Thanks.

406
00:46:40,854 --> 00:46:42,272
Thanks, but...

407
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:45,108
I have a couple of rules when dating a woman.

408
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:46,434
Rules?

409
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:52,066
One, I won't date nice girls.

410
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,496
Two, I won't mess with foolish girls.

411
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:03,419
Three, I definitely don't get involved
with girls connected with my friends.

412
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:11,263
You know that all these rules apply to you, right?

413
00:47:12,156 --> 00:47:13,496
My answer is no.

414
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:14,486
Sunbae...

415
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,745
You know the way out, right?

417
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:52,558
<i>AHHH! WHAT IS THAT!</i>

418
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:55,056
<i>SOMEBODY SAVE ME!</i>

419
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:57,747
<i>WHAT THE HECK IS THAT!</i>

421
00:49:03,204 --> 00:49:04,618
WHAT IS THAT!

422
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:06,341
SOMEBODY SAVE ME!

423
00:49:06,795 --> 00:49:08,249
DON'T COME HERE!

424
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,122
Hey, Gu Jun Pyo!
What's going on? Are you okay?

425
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:19,064
You little...

426
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,028
Hey! That...

427
00:49:41,452 --> 00:49:42,574
Are you okay now?

428
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:45,672
I can't study because of your loud screaming.

429
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:48,376
You're a big nuisance to this neighborhood.

430
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:53,046
If you do it again, I'll call the police!

431
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:57,634
- Hey, Geum Jan Di.
- What? What now?

432
00:49:58,452 --> 00:50:02,277
Can you... stay for a little while?

433
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:46,891
Unni.

434
00:51:49,734 --> 00:51:54,018
Jan Di!
Why didn't tell me you moved?

435
00:51:55,084 --> 00:51:57,951
How did you know?

436
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:01,694
I went to your house, but you weren't there,
so I asked Ga Eul.

437
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,611
Oh yeah. I heard about your parents.

438
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,295
Are you okay?

439
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,204
But what is all this?

440
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:13,130
They're housewarming gifts.

441
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:15,766
Housewarming gifts?

442
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,649
Chen, can you wait in the car?

443
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,841
Yes, Miss.

444
00:52:25,593 --> 00:52:29,526
So this is what they call a rooftop house.

445
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,288
This is so romantic.

446
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:37,990
Sorry. If that offended you, I'm sorry.

447
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,636
That's not what I meant.

448
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,188
I know.

449
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:47,001
It's cold. So why don't
you've some tea before you go?

450
00:52:47,002 --> 00:52:48,504
Is it okay?

451
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:51,000
Sure, sit there.

452
00:52:53,076 --> 00:52:54,768
I can do that, right?

453
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:40,531
[Henri Matisse]

454
00:54:42,642 --> 00:54:45,347
Is this a new way of interrupting someone's nap?

455
00:54:57,417 --> 00:54:59,836
I didn't know you had an interest in art.

456
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:01,987
Oh, this?

457
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:07,315
I've to write a report on some art exhibition,
but it has ended now.

458
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:11,908
But the ticket was so expensive,
I probably couldn't afford to go anyway.

459
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,440
So I thought I would look at pictures
in this book and write it.

460
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:16,847
When is it due?

461
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,500
Huh?

462
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:21,600
Your homework, when is it due?

463
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:55,514
<i>Information: no exhibition today</i>

464
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:26,641
Come on in.

465
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:30,114
Do you like that?

466
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,507
No.

467
00:57:33,002 --> 00:57:34,603
I'm fine with this.

468
00:57:38,492 --> 00:57:40,854
By any chance, do you know the answer to this?

469
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:46,136
Why the lotus flowers blossom in mud?

470
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:47,583
What?

471
00:57:57,532 --> 00:58:00,958
<i>The young lady's face can
make muddy water clear.</i>

472
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:03,097
Be sure to treasure her.

473
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,832
What?

474
00:58:05,676 --> 00:58:08,428
That girl will give you a family.

475
00:59:03,921 --> 00:59:06,339
Now you're using me as
a model without permission?

476
00:59:07,537 --> 00:59:08,973
You're awake?

477
00:59:11,693 --> 00:59:16,060
Had I known ahead of time,
I'd have kept a charge account.

478
00:59:17,912 --> 00:59:19,726
What type of charge account?

479
00:59:20,614 --> 00:59:25,851
To collect from Geum Jan Di,
the transportation fee, coffee fee,

480
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:30,167
performance admission fee, and modeling fee.

481
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:32,886
If I add it all up, it should be a hefty sum.

482
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:38,435
First. Here's your modeling fee.

483
00:59:49,246 --> 00:59:51,878
You drew it so well,

484
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:54,621
that I might have to pay you.

485
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:03,215
Here.

486
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:28,809
They say that even though
lotus flowers bloom in mud,

487
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:31,805
they make the world clean and fragrant.

488
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:38,020
Their name is pretty, and so are their actions.

489
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:40,211
You are like that.

490
01:00:40,947 --> 01:00:42,147
Huh?

491
01:00:43,229 --> 01:00:44,319
Oh yes!

492
01:00:44,442 --> 01:00:45,703
Homework solved!

493
01:00:46,534 --> 01:00:47,936
Homework?

494
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:56,374
The more I see you, the more
I'm reminded of the lotus flower.

495
01:00:57,031 --> 01:00:59,189
Lotus flower?

496
01:00:59,327 --> 01:01:02,829
Do you know why the lotus flowers bloom in mud?

497
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:03,884
Huh?

498
01:01:03,898 --> 01:01:06,281
That'll be your homework until next time!

499
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:10,367
I happily accept your present.

500
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:24,927
What about the witch?

501
01:01:25,127 --> 01:01:27,141
She's still in Vancouver.

502
01:01:27,594 --> 01:01:29,429
Please help me cover things up.

503
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:30,764
- Yes sir.
- Gu Jun Pyo!

504
01:01:30,775 --> 01:01:33,465
- Please, you really can't do this...
- Please, you can't go in...

505
01:01:36,588 --> 01:01:38,059
Gu Jun Pyo!

506
01:01:39,564 --> 01:01:40,723
You again?

507
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:43,607
We definitely have some kind of a connection.

508
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:47,033
I suddenly felt that if I come here,
I would be able to see you.

509
01:01:47,234 --> 01:01:49,604
Did you boil and eat
your cell phone or something?

510
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:54,410
Didn't you learn to call and get
permission before visiting someone?

511
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:00,521
Now that I think about it.

512
01:02:00,522 --> 01:02:02,306
I don't remember ever
learning anything like that.

513
01:02:02,565 --> 01:02:04,391
Jun Pyo, do you do that?

514
01:02:04,734 --> 01:02:07,806
Hey, Monkey.
Aren't you gonna hurry and get up?

515
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,255
Why are you lying on someone else's bed?

516
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:13,494
Hurry and get up.

517
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:16,003
Get up, come on!

518
01:02:17,144 --> 01:02:18,651
I said, get up!

519
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:26,148
Do you want make a bet with me?

526
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:01,499
I just want to ask you one thing,
will you answer me?

527
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:03,325
<i>Friendship or love.</i>

528
01:03:03,872 --> 01:03:08,372
If you had to choose between them,
which would you pick?

<i>You're putting too much pressure on your wrist.</i>

<i>This...</i>

532
01:03:16,023 --> 01:03:18,715
Oh, that. It's quiet pretty, isn't it?

533
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,362
I think Jun Pyo hyung still likes you!

534
01:03:26,688 --> 01:03:29,178
<i>Don't you have anything more to report to me?</i>

535
01:03:29,316 --> 01:03:30,297
Yes?

538

Where did you get an idiot
who doesn't even know the menu?

539
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:40,453
Please look kindly on me.

540
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,822
