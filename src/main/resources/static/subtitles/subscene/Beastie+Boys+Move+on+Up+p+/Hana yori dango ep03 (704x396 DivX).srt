1
00:00:00,818 --> 00:00:03,537
Hurry up and leave...

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,316
Looks like you've gotten yourself wet...

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,368
Thank you.

4
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,106
You're very pretty.

5
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,645
What madness has caused you to like this girl?

6
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:17,747
This girl has gotten The Red Paper before.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,435
Wait a minute!

8
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,109
They've kissed!

9
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:36,044
Don't say it so loudly.

10
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,534
Good for you, Tsukushi!

11
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:40,418
It's not good at all,
in fact it's horrible.

12
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:42,560
Don't you like him a lot?

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,959
How can I like her?

14
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,600
You didn't kiss Hanazawa Rui?

15
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:48,665
It was so horrible.

16
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:49,715
But then,

17
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:53,110
why would someone who considers you
his enemy, kiss you?

18
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,619
That's why I think you two make the perfect pair.

19
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:57,385
You've got to be kidding!
No way that's going to happen.

20
00:00:57,385 --> 00:01:01,867
Then, how is it that you two kissed
when both of you fell together?

21
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:05,665
Are you saying that I originally intended
to kiss that slut?

22
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,252
The probability of that is high.

23
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:10,523
Hey...

24
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:12,355
How is that so?

25
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,021
Your first kiss is was taken by your most hated person on earth.

26
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:21,922
The two of you are fated to be together.

27
00:01:21,946 --> 00:01:22,747
That can't be true...

28
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,074
Your first kiss was taken by the man
you hated the most,

29
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:28,240
Hang on, old lady.

30
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:33,724
and it was right in front of the person
whom you liked the most.

31
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:40,097
Why are you so interested in this?

32
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:40,952
So...

33
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:42,694
What was the feeling of your first kiss like?

34
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:45,057
It is not the first kiss.

35
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:47,316
But if I haven't gotten it wrong,
it indeed was your first kiss.

36
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,598
No it isn't!

37
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:50,991
As usual,
what Tsukasa does is different from other people.

38
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,821
You people don't completely understand me

39
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,152
When was it?

40
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:55,882
Eh?

41
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,926
If yesterday wasn't your first kiss,
then when was it?

42
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:00,304
Huh?

43
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:03,014
So that...

44
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:05,631
yesterday?

45
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:12,030
Sigh...
I can never go back to the emergency staircase.

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,954
Well I think it's a good opportunity.
Why don't you just go along with the flow?

47
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:16,397
Don't you think so?

48
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,008
Eh??

49
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:18,371
Even if that happened,

50
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,585
but I really liked you,

51
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:23,193
the only person in my heart would still be you.

52
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:25,357
What are you saying?

53
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:26,725
Firstly,

54
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:29,453
he already has Shizuka-san.

55
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:33,377
You can't just give up like this,
and not tell him what your heart says.

56
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:36,470
Why don't you tell him your true feelings for him.

57
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,190
Maybe there's still a chance...

58
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,417
You might be right there...

59
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:51,609
I had this feeling that we could be together.

60
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,661
You're very pretty.

61
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,737
Pretty...

62
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:02,573
He said I was very pretty.

63
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:03,733
Eh?

64
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:06,692
Well... Hanazawa Rui

65
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,769
saw my new clothes

66
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:12,326
and said I was very pretty.

67
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,790
You're not kidding?

68
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,549
Tsukushi's Prince Charming?

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,262
Hanazawa Rui really said that?

70
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,731
I can't just forget about what
happened with Rui.

71
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,748
Don't be like this.
Just forgive him this time.

72
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,825
If he apologises to me,
then I'll forgive him.

73
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:31,079
Well, it's clear that we all feel lonely
when Rui isn't around.

74
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,476
Nonsense!

75
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:33,976
It doesn't make a difference
if Rui was here or not.

76
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:36,425
Don't be so direct when you want to say something

77
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,346
Quickly make up with Tsukasa.

78
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:41,565
Lately,
he's been very touchy.

79
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:43,079
Perhaps he really is like that.

80
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,111
But what made me mad

81
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,965
were the rude things he said to you.

82
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,194
But...

83
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:55,105
You weren't very happy either

84
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,922
when Tsukasa and Tsukushi kissed.

85
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:58,544
Eh?

86
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:02,124
You like her a bit.

87
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:03,651
I know that.

88
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,526
See you.

89
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:14,501
This is like a fight where
both sides are unwilling to give in.

90
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:17,624
You guys are really stubborn.

91
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,841
Even I cannot compare.

92
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,258
Eh?

93
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:25,916
Isn't that Makino Tsukushi?

94
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,779
What?

95
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,128
We must stop here, Tsukasa.
Now's the chance...

96
00:04:29,128 --> 00:04:30,032
Eh?

97
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:34,199
Stop playing a fool.
Don't stop the car.

98
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,208
Checkmate!

99
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,956
Yes!

100
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:56,122
You must treat her well.

101
00:04:57,253 --> 00:05:02,144
Then I won't have any worries
about taking care of her.

102
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,820
How troublesome...

103
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,912
Eh?

104
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:11,476
You already know my true feelings

105
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:14,199
Yet you insist that I go for someone else.

106
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:17,892
Rui...

107
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,479
You get it, right?

108
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:27,006
What are you saying, "having no worries
about taking care of her".

109
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,142
I really don't get it.

110
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,121
Rui!

111
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,925
Oh dear.

112
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:46,958
Rui,
Wait a minute.

113
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,559
Rui!

114
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,135
I...

115
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,170
That's why I came back from France.

116
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:04,477
It's because I wanted to live
by my own means.

117
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,909
So I decided to come back from France.

118
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:14,613
To realise my dream of becoming
an international lawyer.

119
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:17,021
To live up to the name of Toudou.

120
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:23,967
I don't want to rely on the wealth
that I can inherit from the Toudou family.

121
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,574
But to live in France

122
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,746
as an ordinary person.

123
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:45,536
Hana Yori Dango - Boys Over Flowers

Next is...

133
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:52,722
"Senzai ichiguu"
(A fated meeting that occurs once in a thousand years.)

134
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:54,706
Yea,
that will definitely come out in the next exam.

135
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,882
"Senzai ichiguu"?

136
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,029
I've got it!

137
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,333
It means, when doing the washing,
one should use one full cup of detergent.
("Sentaku" is the washing of clothes,
"Senzai" is detergent,
"Ichi" is one)

138
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:03,868
That's it, right?

139
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:04,928
Right...

140
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:07,409
Senzai... Ichi... Guu... - One cup of washing detergent
("Senzai" is detegent,
"Ichi" is one)

141
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:08,557
Wrong!

142
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:12,005
Then what's the right answer?

143
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:15,926
An opportunity that comes once
in a thousand years.

144
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,119
Oh that's it.

145
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:17,907
For example...

146
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,810
There's someone you really like
but he already has a girlfriend.

147
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,039
But then suddenly, he decides to break up with her,
and becomes available again.

148
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,969
That would be a "Senzai Ichiguu" chance.
So it's used like that.

149
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,972
So that's how it is.

150
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:32,491
I'm full already.

151
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,884
Tsukushi, why don't you eat another bowl?

152
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:36,497
Well...

153
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:41,008
My stomach is already very full.

154
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:42,635
Then, I'm done eating as well.

155
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:44,373
The dishes are still hot, why leave now?

156
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,004
I still feel bloated.

157
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,977
My stomach feels like it is inside out.

158
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:51,341
Well said, kid.

159
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:55,201
You made a joke, just like me.
Your level has just gone up.

160
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,027
We shouldn't joke about love relationships.

161
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:58,951
What?

162
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:00,563
She's been acting weird

163
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:03,645
ever since she came back from the party.

164
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:08,782
Maybe... She's already in a relationship
with one of those rich guys.

165
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,631
So it's our family status,
that causing her to be uneasy about it.

166
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,041
Is that for real?

167
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,523
That girl is really serious about
dating one of those rich guys?

168
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:21,137
Well isn't that a "Senzai ichiguu" chance?
(A fated meeting that occurs once in a thousand years.)

169
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,946
We're going to be rich!!

170
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:30,109
"Senzai ichiguu"...

171
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:19,767
Sanjou Sakurako doesn't even dare to come to school

172
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:23,046
You really aren't afraid of anything.

173
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,636
Yeaa...

174
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:26,832
Huh?

175
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:30,133
It's rumoured that she has left the school.

176
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,048
Eh?

177
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:36,984
It really is your fault that she became like this.

178
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:40,786
And you still dare to come to school
as if nothing happened.

179
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,287
They're right about me not wanting to go to school.

180
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:55,425
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

181
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:58,068
No.

182
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,778
Tsukushi-chan,

183
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:08,663
I heard that you kissed Doumyoji at the party.
Is that true?

184
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:11,542
What kiss?
It was an accident.

185
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:16,523
Don't worry.

186
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:18,731
He won't bother you again.

187
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,420
Sakurako-san

188
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:29,965
I'll always be by your side.

189
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:36,180
You can always look me up
if you feel lonely or troubled.

190
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:47,557
See you.

191
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:03,570
Oh goodness.
If I don't hurry...

192
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:09,865
This is horrible.

193
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,126
Oh!

194
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:12,961
It's you.

195
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,078
What a coincidence.

196
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,521
If you stop the car there,
it will block the pedestrians.

197
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:20,772
I heard that you've been skipping classes.

198
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:22,375
It's none of your business.

199
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,193
Huh?

200
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,740
Aren't you skipping classes as well?

201
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,276
I'm going for my classes now.

202
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,470
Oh? Well then...
I'm going back.

203
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,483
Hey hey...

204
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:31,924
The last time you kissed me

205
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,095
be sure not to fall in love with me.

206
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:35,531
Huh??

207
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:37,666
Have you lost your mind?
I really don't get you.

208
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,434
Get in.

209
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,564
What?

210
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:42,174
I'll give you a lift to school, so get in.

211
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,967
W... Wait...
Let me go!

212
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,769
This is unbelievable!

213
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,237
What are you saying, you...

214
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,194
Stop there!!

215
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,002
That girl runs really fast...

216
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:08,285
Don't be such an idiot!

217
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:15,153
It can't be...

218
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,700
What?

219
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:37,396
Wh... What?

220
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,906
It hurts, sis!

221
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,690
Sister?

222
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,073
Hi there.

223
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:06,908
Why is Makino Tsukushi with Ms Tsubaki?

224
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,229
You can always contact me at this address.

225
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,408
Yes

226
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:14,529
Los Angeles??

227
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:18,276
If Tsukushi-san calls me,
I'll fly back immediately.

228
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:19,885
Fly back...

229
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,739
In a private jet.

230
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:23,852
You're serious about flying back.

231
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:25,230
I'm stopping over in Japan for a while.

232
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,066
If I have time, I'll have a meal with you.

233
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,827
Umm...

234
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,687
Why are you so nice to me?

235
00:15:33,128 --> 00:15:36,259
That idiot of a brother seems to be giving you some trouble.

236
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,638
Then again,

237
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,363
Two people can really have similar tastes.

238
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:42,219
Huh?

239
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,733
You and I...

240
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,956
My my...

241
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:51,381
You're as innocent as Tsukasa.

242
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,962
Perhaps he really likes you, Tsukushi-chan.

243
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:56,851
Hmm?

244
00:15:56,851 --> 00:15:58,775
Well then, see you. Look me up anytime.

245
00:15:58,775 --> 00:15:59,551
Oh...

246
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:00,571
Okay.

247
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:03,800
Thank you very much.

248
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,515
So cool...

249
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:12,787
Ah! So cool!!!

250
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,526
Madam.
(Literally, Madam Representative)

251
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:45,581
Ms Tsubaki has returned today.

252
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:46,898
Tsubaki?

253
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:48,808
Yes, that would be the older sister.

254
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:52,618
If she has any private matters,

255
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:54,283
Nishida,

256
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:55,578
prepare his retirement grant and lump sum pay.

257
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:56,362
Yes ma'am.

258
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:57,474
Do it by today.

259
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,282
Madam!

260
00:16:58,282 --> 00:16:59,482
Please wait a minute!!

261
00:16:59,482 --> 00:17:00,997
Please wait!

262
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:02,226
Let me go!

263
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:06,563
The meeting will now begin,

264
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:10,292
for the temporary board of directors
of the Doumyoji Group.

265
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,152
Madam.

266
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:13,346
This concerns the remaining issues we have

267
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:15,976
regarding our restaurant.

268
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:21,326
Yes, it was caused by the English.

269
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:24,089
At the moment, the situation is under control.

270
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,009
If we continue this,

271
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:29,231
everyone will get wind of this.

272
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:30,697
And once the news is out,

273
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:33,854
it will have a very adverse effect on the Doumyoji Group.

274
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,833
**Doumyoji Group raises profits by 25% this week.**

275
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,896
**Issue brings about huge criticism**

276
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:45,588
She hasn't changed a bit.
Mom still does whatever she wants to do.

277
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:47,391
What!?

278
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:49,121
Don't just come in as you like.

279
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:52,428
My apologies about just now.

280
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,467
Why have you come back?

281
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:59,066
My husband has some things to settle here.

282
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:03,528
What problems has that fool run into now?

283
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:07,392
No one calls his brother-in-law a fool.

284
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:11,166
Why do you still stick to someone you don't like?

285
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:16,006
I'm very happy now, I've gotten used to it.

286
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:18,990
It's clear you don't want to get married.

287
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,120
Eh? When has it been like that?

288
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:24,504
Which means, you actually want me to leave him

289
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,069
and return home

290
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:28,400
Maybe you just want to live with your sis again?

291
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,998
Don't say such disgusting things.

292
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,516
Well,

293
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:35,576
how long are you staying?

294
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:37,595
About a week.

295
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:44,993
Don't look so lonely, I'll be back real soon.

296
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,408
It doesn't really matter if you're back or not.

297
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,275
Well, Tsukasa-san

298
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:51,918
Do you like that girl?

299
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:52,755
Huh?

300
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:55,521
I'm talking about that girl, Tsukushi-chan,
whom you were chasing

301
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:57,088
What are you saying all of a sudden?

302
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,325
It won't happen.

303
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:03,077
What?

304
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:07,312
If you're not a little more gentle to her,
she'll definitely leave you.

305
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,879
I have no idea what you're talking about.
It doesn't concern you anyway.

306
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,619
If you have any questions about relationships,

307
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,499
you can always ask me.

308
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:20,679
Sis.

309
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,191
Hey look at this.

310
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:24,239
It's Shizuka-chan.

311
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,230
Oh.

312
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,907
Eh? Shizuka-chan...

313
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:30,508
When did she start studying overseas?

314
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:48,281
Tomorrow,

315
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:50,422
I definitely want to see him.

316
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:13,112
Yes.

317
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:32,325
Why isn't he here?

318
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,050
I really want to meet him again!

319
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,757
It can't be...

320
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,354
Eh...

321
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:47,979
Who do you want to meet again?

322
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,244
Eh?

323
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:51,739
Umm.. Umm...

324
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,680
Oh yeah... Umm...

325
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,093
It's been a while.

326
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:03,903
Well... This...

327
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:05,514
Shizuka-san.

328
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:09,471
She's busy with a lot of things
before she returns to France.

329
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:13,433
She really...

330
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,624
wants to go back to France.

331
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,979
Are you alright with that?

332
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:32,025
Well I think...

333
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,241
She's the type that doesn't really care
about what others think.

334
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:37,955
If she wants to do something,
nothing can stop her.

335
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:07,518
But then,

336
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:10,417
if you don't do something...

337
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:16,176
we won't be able to see her again.

338
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:21,094
Want to see her?

339
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:22,464
Eh?

340
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,406
Do you want to see Shizuka again?

341
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:28,340
Well, no...

342
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,206
Just now you mentioned...

343
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:33,446
seeing Shizuka again?

344
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:35,423
Ah...

345
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:37,195
That's right.

346
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:42,184
You've said that you really admire Shizuka.

347
00:22:49,082 --> 00:22:51,531
**Toudou**

348
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:54,191
Miss.

349
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,298
Hanazawa Rui is here to see you.

350
00:22:57,073 --> 00:22:58,364
Ah!

351
00:22:58,364 --> 00:22:59,324
Good evening.

352
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:00,609
Good evening.

353
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:03,173
She wants to thank you
about what happeend at the party.

354
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,123
There's no need for that.

355
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:08,236
Your mom?
She still angry?

356
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:11,046
She agreed for the time being.

357
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:13,423
But she's still reluctant to completely let go.

358
00:23:13,423 --> 00:23:14,465
I see...

359
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:16,610
I'll go say "Hi" to your mom.

360
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:20,884
It's a bit messy,
but come in.

361
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,461
You're... Already preparing to leave.

362
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:33,104
Although there's still a week left,

363
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:35,581
it's better to prepare in advance.

364
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:39,228
A week left...?

365
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:44,485
Today, I went to school to request
for my withdrawal.

366
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:47,841
Then... You won't be coming back?

367
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,867
Yea.

368
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,498
That's what I've decided.

369
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:02,159
Can you tell?

370
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:05,145
That's F4 and I.

371
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:08,253
The one on the left,
that's Rui and I when we were young.

372
00:24:08,253 --> 00:24:09,897
Isn't it cute?

373
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:15,070
That kind of smile,
I've never seen it before.

374
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,444
He really...

375
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,884
really liked her...

376
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:30,955
right from the start.

377
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,435
Please don't go back to France.

378
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:43,747
What are you saying?

379
00:24:43,747 --> 00:24:45,777
For Hanazawa Rui,

380
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,751
I want you to stay in Japan.

381
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:53,113
He's always around the emergency staircase,

382
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:57,817
always hoping that Shizuka-san would return.

383
00:24:57,817 --> 00:24:59,883
Everytime he talks about Shizuka-san,

384
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:03,810
his face will be lit with a warm smile.

385
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,369
But...

386
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,931
Once Shizuka-san decided to leave for France,

387
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:10,947
he's stopped going there.

388
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,612
He's dissappeared for a while.

389
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,856
And then comes back with such a sad face.

390
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,456
If Shizuka-san returns to France,

391
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,546
Hanazawa Rui will...

392
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:28,760
not be his true self.

393
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:33,161
That is why,

394
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:36,132
I'm asking that you stay in Japan.

395
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,445
I'm sorry,

396
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,881
I cannot do that.

397
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:51,699
I'm begging you Shizuka-san.

398
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,330
I know that by doing this, it is hard for you.

399
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,199
I know that what I'm doing is very foolish.

400
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,756
Look up at me.

401
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:04,039
Well for me,

402
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,189
the decisions I make

403
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:10,456
are just like when buying something overseas.

404
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:15,135
If I let the chance go and not buy it back,

405
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:17,827
I won't be able to buy it again.

406
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,991
People will then think

407
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:27,602
that it's a good chance to buy it,
and continue to live on.

408
00:26:28,928 --> 00:26:30,145
But then,

409
00:26:30,145 --> 00:26:31,719
I...

410
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:34,903
don't want to be one of those people,

411
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:40,091
even though I might have regrets later on.

412
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:48,115
I want to be myself,
living as I choose to live.

413
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,263
I hope you understand.

414
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,258
I understand.

415
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,037
I've said things I shouldn't have, sorry.

416
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:12,334
No not that.

417
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:15,939
I'm happy, really.

418
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:23,683
About Rui,

419
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,055
please take care of him.

420
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:32,764
I'm really sorry.

421
00:27:38,153 --> 00:27:39,463
What are you doing?

422
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:43,760
Eh?

423
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,784
What was that all about just now?

424
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,827
Who asked you to do that?

425
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:00,385
I didn't bring you here to do that kind of thing.

426
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,231
Was it for me?

427
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,642
What difference does it make?

428
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:11,626
Mind your own business.

429
00:28:12,506 --> 00:28:14,086
"Mind you own business"?

430
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:16,127
What are you thinking?

431
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:19,281
Begging in a place like that.

432
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:19,949
I...

433
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:22,891
Why are you doing that?

434
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:28,564
I really can't believe it.

435
00:28:31,552 --> 00:28:35,675
You look so sad and pitiful.

436
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:37,592
You won't be able to see her again.

437
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,936
This is none of your business.

438
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:45,689
Go back.

439
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:52,554
Go back!

440
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:48,086
Shizuka.

441
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:52,438
About what happened at the party...

442
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,494
I understand.

443
00:30:58,162 --> 00:31:01,144
We give you our best wishes.

444
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:03,829
I give you guys my best wishes as well.

445
00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:07,486
Help me say goodbye to Rui.

446
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:15,832
See you.

447
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:17,556
See you.

448
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,586
Well, I'll be off.

449
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:23,142
Good luck. Have a safe trip.

450
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:25,293
Thank you.

451
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:26,236
Good bye.

452
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,709
Shizuka-san!

453
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:33,868
You came.

454
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,900
I'm very sorry I'm late.

455
00:31:41,253 --> 00:31:42,778
Hanazawa Rui?

456
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,301
He didn't come.

457
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,734
He really is a small kid.

458
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:49,373
Oh yes.

459
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:55,062
Here, these are for you?

460
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,111
This pair really looks good on you.

461
00:31:58,111 --> 00:31:59,483
But...

462
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:04,789
You must let them bring you to wonderful places.

463
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,668
I'll be working hard too.

464
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:14,176
See you.

465
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:19,330
See you!

466
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,780
Goodbye everyone.

467
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,782
Good luck!

468
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,451
Rui!

469
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:38,903
What have you been doing?

470
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:40,358
When did you arrive?

471
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,871
An hour ago.

472
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:43,393
Then why didn't you come here?

473
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:45,974
I've been watching you guys.

474
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:47,726
What an idiot.

475
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:51,865
Go after her!

476
00:32:53,174 --> 00:32:54,732
If you like her,

477
00:32:54,732 --> 00:32:57,654
you have to go after her, right?

478
00:32:57,654 --> 00:33:00,264
Are you just going to be satisfied watching?

479
00:33:00,264 --> 00:33:03,020
Do you still consider yourself a man?

480
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,224
I'll go.

481
00:33:05,224 --> 00:33:06,419
Eh?

482
00:33:07,016 --> 00:33:09,968
I'll be leaving for France

483
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,296
as well.

484
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,272
Rui

485
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,459
You kidding.

486
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,693
Makino.

487
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:19,451
Well I...

488
00:33:19,451 --> 00:33:22,416
really like your determination.

489
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:25,719
That's what I really lack.

490
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:29,567
I finally realised that

491
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,895
I can't continue like this.

492
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:36,277
Thank you.

493
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,117
Wait a minute, Rui!

494
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,819
Are you really leaving?

495
00:34:10,322 --> 00:34:11,169
Yes.

496
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:16,595
Why??

497
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:19,513
Why didn't you come to us to talk about it?

498
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:22,552
I'm sorry...

499
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:31,666
Haven't we been together all this while?

500
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,027
Why do you suddenly want to leave us?

501
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:39,251
Why??

502
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,479
Where did you suddenly get the idea from?

503
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,443
Tsukasa. About last time...

504
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:46,560
It doesn't matter any more.

505
00:34:48,598 --> 00:34:50,162
Say,

506
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:54,405
do you really want to go?

507
00:34:57,872 --> 00:34:59,769
Rui

508
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,057
Stop playing with us.

509
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:10,001
If you really are leaving,
we won't have you around anymore.

510
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:14,058
Does it really not matter to you?

511
00:35:16,346 --> 00:35:17,981
Rui!

512
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,161
Take care,

513
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,194
Tsukasa.

514
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,768
In Paris...

515
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:33,116
If you meet any bad people in Paris

516
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:35,220
tell me immediately.

517
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,711
The three of us will fly there to help.

518
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,450
Ya...

519
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,847
You got it?

520
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:47,609
Thank you. I'll be off.

521
00:35:58,962 --> 00:36:00,279
Tsukasa.

522
00:36:02,654 --> 00:36:03,593
Take it.

523
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,320
Rui!

524
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,229
Bye bye...

525
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,370
Hanazawa Rui.

526
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:42,265
Rui!!

527
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:44,571
Good luck!

528
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:49,234
Rui! Take care!

529
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:51,857
Rui!

530
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,181
Rui!

531
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,705
My opinion of him has changed a little.

532
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:05,108
That's the bond between men.

533
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,014
Well that guy is full of surprises.

534
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:10,482
Old lady...

535
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:13,612
Of all the men I've met before,

536
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:17,124
some put on a "tiger mask".

537
00:37:17,124 --> 00:37:18,379
It has begun...

538
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:21,649
They appear very frightening, and violent.

539
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,948
But those men are actually soft-hearted.

540
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:26,926
He's actually sending whatever money they can spare

541
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:30,185
back home to help out in the finances.

542
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:32,116
Didn't you say they have "tiger masks"?

543
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,699
Well he...

544
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:36,287
cannot allow his true lonely self

545
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,702
to be seen by others.

546
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:41,954
At that time,
the only person who could understand him well

547
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:44,264
would be me alone.

548
00:37:46,116 --> 00:37:49,493
I really have no idea what she's talking about.

549
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:53,793
I never got to it after all.

550
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:04,548
To Rui

551
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:09,968
How's Paris?

552
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:12,379
How are you?

553
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:28,230
Do you...

554
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:32,361
like...

555
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:33,560
Makino Tsukushi?

556
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,579
What are you writing?

557
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,469
Maybe you're writing a love letter!

558
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:38,473
Of course not!

559
00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:41,469
Didn't I say not to come in as you like?
Hey wait...

560
00:38:42,376 --> 00:38:46,181
"Kazu"??
(He wrote "Kazu" instead of "Rui", they look alike)

561
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:48,306
It's "Rui", idiot.

562
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,116
Don't tell me you can't even recognise simple Kanji.

563
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:54,135
I think it's better if I write it for you.

564
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:57,743
Why?
How do I convey my personal feelings to him if you write it?

565
00:38:58,206 --> 00:39:02,302
Tsukasa,
what do you have left to say to him?

566
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:03,320
That guy...

567
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,263
going to France to go after Shizuka.

568
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:09,305
Oh... So that's how it was.

569
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,905
He's done well, that Rui.

570
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:12,384
Are you kidding?

571
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:15,675
He even left his best friends behind.

572
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:20,432
When you love, you wish to do things for it.

573
00:39:20,432 --> 00:39:23,187
You wish to sacrifice for it.

574
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:25,545
You wish to serve for it.

575
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:26,358
Huh?

576
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:29,004
That's from Hemingway's short story.
(pg 72, A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway)

577
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:33,340
When you truly love someone,

578
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,275
you will understand what I said.

579
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,554
But until then, Tsukasa,

580
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:41,191
you must treasure the person

581
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:43,022
whom you really like.

582
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:44,309
You must remember,

583
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:47,811
you musn't be too fast in relationships. And...
(Tsukasa interprets what his sister says wrongly,
you'll see later)

584
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:50,906
you can't just buy a person's heart with money.

585
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:53,593
In order to be loved,

586
00:39:53,593 --> 00:39:57,032
you must first give your love.

587
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:01,945
My goodness, sis.

588
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:03,653
I now...

589
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:05,555
feel like lightning has struck me.
(Tsukasa's Japanese fails)

590
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:07,903
What "lightning has struck me"?
Your choice of words is wrong again.

591
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:09,783
I need to completely change my perception.

592
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,489
How can perception be changed...

593
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:12,748
You really are great, sis.

594
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:14,283
Thanks a lot!

595
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:16,776
When you leave the country tomorrow,
be sure to come back safely.

596
00:40:16,776 --> 00:40:19,332
What a wonderful suggestion.

597
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:21,101
The next time you come back

598
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:23,777
I'll definitely have something for you to see.

599
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:30,964
Is it okay, just leaving like this?

600
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:32,753
OK! OK!

601
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:45,047
Thank you for the food.

602
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:48,746
Such a pity that Rui-san is gone.

603
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,361
Shizuka-san won't be returning too.

604
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,742
Tsubaki-san is also leaving soon.

605
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:59,071
It seems like those who have been defending you
have all gone.

606
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:06,832
If you want to fight, go ahead.

607
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:09,243
Since when have I depended on anyone else?

608
00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:10,723
Don't be so quick to say...

609
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:14,856
Ah... I've been accidentally pushed over
by Doumyoji-sama...

610
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:16,691
Shut up,
you ugly witch.

611
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,257
How cruel.

612
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:19,921
Yuriko...

613
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:23,520
What?

614
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,862
Woah...

615
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:30,704
Oh my... I must go one round.
(The Japanese words actually translate to
"I musn't be too fast")

616
00:41:31,601 --> 00:41:32,500
Eh?

617
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:39,957
Sunday, 1pm at the open area
at "Ebisu Garden Place" near the clock.

618
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:49,114
Why? Why is the wealthy Doumyoji-sama
going out with a girl like her?

619
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:51,279
Even I have not heard of such a thing happening...

620
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:54,848
Which means, he wants to date her...

621
00:42:11,506 --> 00:42:12,895
Umm...

622
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:14,917
Huh?

623
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:20,157
What is it?!

624
00:42:20,157 --> 00:42:24,122
About just now...

625
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:26,404
What about it?

626
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:28,805
I don't know nothing, stupid.

627
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:33,345
Anyway,

628
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:35,500
Hemingway

629
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,935
Heming...?

630
00:42:38,946 --> 00:42:40,794
You should really read more.

631
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,482
I think I'm a little early.

632
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:13,697
Well then, if she doesn't come 5 minutes before 1pm,
I'll show her...

633
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,845
Isn't it today? Are you sure it's okay to not go?

634
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,741
Why must I pitifully spend my Sunday
with a guy like him?

635
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:24,286
If you don't go, he might seriously take revenge.

636
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,366
That's true...

637
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:30,360
If you go, it's hell. If you don't go, it's still hell.

638
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:35,889
Well I'm already in a fight with him,
he can wait all he wants.

639
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:38,875
Ah... That's pretty!

640
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,441
Sorry.

641
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:53,293
I'm late.

642
00:43:58,188 --> 00:43:59,752
I'm going to beat her up.

643
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:03,497
Thanks for the food!

644
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:06,289
Wait a minute...

645
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,125
How's it?

646
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,667
How's it?

647
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:13,270
How 'bout that...

648
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,918
Oh, so pretty!

649
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:37,935
What kind of toy is that?

650
00:44:37,935 --> 00:44:40,458
I think it should be "tiger mask".

651
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:45,142
Oh, how cute.

652
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:47,555
Oh yea, that old lady mentioned before...

653
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:50,723
Men with a "tiger mask" aren't able to show

654
00:44:50,723 --> 00:44:53,089
their true, lonely, self to other people.

655
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:06,625
Rui!

656
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:17,689
I'm sorry, Yuuki.

657
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:19,972
Wait a minute! Tsukushi!

658
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:22,686
Where are you going?

659
00:45:29,318 --> 00:45:30,778
Hemingway

660
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:37,563
Sunday, 1pm at the open area
at "Ebisu Garden Place" near the clock.

661
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:40,340
He wants to date me?

662
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:42,553
It can't be true.

663
00:45:43,463 --> 00:45:45,765
It can never happen.

664
00:45:46,636 --> 00:45:48,765
It's already so late,

665
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,771
he'll definitely not be there.

666
00:45:53,014 --> 00:45:54,544
He won't be...

667
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,599
Unbelievable...

668
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:14,510
Why?

669
00:46:20,424 --> 00:46:21,920
This is the girl I like.

670
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,093
Go check on what Tsukasa is doing.

671
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:26,405
You're pretty, let's go.

672
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,060
What's this about?

673
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:35,198
You must be serious about this, Tsukushi.

674
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:37,256
What are you doing?

675
00:46:47,823 --> 00:46:48,973
I believed you...
