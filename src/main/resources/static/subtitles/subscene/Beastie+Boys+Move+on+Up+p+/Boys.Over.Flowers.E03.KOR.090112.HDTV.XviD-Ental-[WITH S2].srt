Episode 3

4
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:56,791
A man, who leaves a beautiful girl
standing by herself, isn't a gentleman.

5
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,415
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

6
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:05,105
<i>I feel like I'm standing on a cloud.</i>

7
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:10,522
<i>It would be nice if you could take your feet off my shoes.</i>

8
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,825
She looks like another person.

9
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:30,554
Definitely Min Seo Hyun's work.

10
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:33,275
Maybe I should take her to
the next exhibition as my partner?

11
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:02,341
What is that?

12
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:08,642
Oh, annoying!

13
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,527
Help me!

14
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:31,784
He fell in!

15
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,325
<i>Jun Pyo...</i>

16
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,925
Gu Jun Pyo sunbae fell into the pool!

17
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,656
<i>Hurry, hurry!</i>

18
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:48,134
What is it?

19
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,755
Why are you so nervous?

20
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:51,214
He can't.

21
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:51,845
What?

22
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:55,845
The one thing Jun Pyo can't do is swim.

23
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:08,264
<i>Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

24
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:09,555
<i>Gu Jun Pyo, wake up!</i>

25
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,385
Open your eyes!

26
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:17,205
Hurry up and breathe, Gu Jun Pyo!

27
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,045
<i>Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

28
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,775
Wake up!

29
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:50,935
What?

30
00:06:01,185 --> 00:06:05,277
You are such a scum.

31
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,165
You deceitful bastard!

32
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:01,635
I'm sorry, Young Master.

33
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,144
<i>I'll prepare a new one.</i>

34
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,355
Please forgive me.

35
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:06,800
What?

36
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:10,804
Do you have a cold?

37
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,895
Should I call Dr. Kim?

38
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,184
What cold?

39
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,424
I feel great.

40
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,395
Prepare the car. I need to quickly get to school.

41
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:23,355
You want to leave this early?

42
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:25,725
It's never too early for a student to go to school.

43
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,734
Don't you know the saying,

44
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:31,663
<i>{\a6}note: The saying is
"The early bird catches the worm."</i>

45
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:31,663
"Bugs who wake up early die early?"

46
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,274
I will fire this maid immediately.

47
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:37,145
Why?

48
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:39,504
Yes?

49
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:50,004
Butler Lee, aren't you too picky?

50
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:52,284
Take it easy, take it easy.

51
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,859
The weather is so nice.

52
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,134
What is this?

53
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,746
Gu Jun Pyo!

54
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:52,744
Don't let me catch you!

55
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:55,042
I definitely won't go easy on you!

56
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:59,807
He asked us here so early and
he's been like this the whole day.

57
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:03,385
This is the first time I've seen
him work so hard at something.

58
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:08,794
But the question is, why
torture a poor transfer student?

59
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:12,334
Also, didn't she save his life?

60
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,804
"Don't bite the hand that feeds you."
You should apply that in this situation, right?

61
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,604
What are you saying,
"don't bite the hand that feeds you?"

62
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,584
This is my way of telling her thanks.

63
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:24,384
Why else would I do such boring
things for someone so lowly?

64
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:28,684
Normal people won't feel grateful for something like this.

65
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,094
Be quiet!

66
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:32,384
It's your turn to scold me since Ji Hoo isn't here?

67
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:33,574
Really!

68
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:34,724
Where is he?

69
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,164
Ever since we came back from Guam.

70
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:38,164
I don't what happened.
He's completely slipped into a depression.

71
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:40,634
It must be a lovers' quarrel.
What else could it be?

72
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,974
Min Seo Hyun is so hard to please.

73
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,905
He's beating around the bush.

74
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:47,954
If you like a girl, you should
just grab her and kiss her.

75
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,375
How hard can it be?

76
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:23,665
I'll leave after I do this.

77
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:37,765
Jun Pyo sunbae isn't enough for her,
she wants Ji Hoo sunbae as well!

78
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:40,849
You are really digging your own grave.

79
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:41,884
<i>Hurry and go!</i>

80
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,084
<i>She looks sly as a fox!</i>

81
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,505
She is the type of girl who won't back off.

82
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:49,695
Stupid girl, what should we do now?

83
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:16,045
What time is it? Why are you here so late?

84
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,175
As a swimmer, how can you not focus on your practice!

85
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,421
Be careful or I'll fire you.

86
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,694
I think they've been together for a while now.

87
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:04,424
Yes, why else would Ji Hoo sunbae protect that weed?

88
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:05,944
So as time passes,

89
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,254
what if your friendship is destroyed because of that girl?

90
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:09,684
You know now, right?

91
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:14,376
That weed looks innocent,
but her actions are those of a snake.

92
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:16,405
Shut up!

93
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:21,496
If you say one word, I will snap your neck.

94
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:37,151
This is the newest model.

95
00:15:32,985 --> 00:15:36,645
Are you disappointed that it wasn't
the person you wanted see?

96
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:39,595
- Gu Jun Pyo, why are you?
- What?

97
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:42,468
I can't come here?

98
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:47,296
Have you two rented this place?

99
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:54,274
- Where are you going?
- I have nothing to say to you, I'm going home, why?

100
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:55,455
I have...

101
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:57,774
- What do you want?
- I have something to say.

102
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,465
Say it and let me go.

103
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,205
Who are you?
You think you can toy with me?

104
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:04,095
Toy with the great F4.

105
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:07,185
Who's toying with who?

106
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:09,458
Let me go!

107
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:13,496
I'm letting you go because
I think you are cute.

108
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,036
Am I a joke?

109
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:18,695
I don't know if you know...

110
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,960
I'm not the kind of person who
repays what is given to me.

111
00:16:23,825 --> 00:16:30,582
I'm dissatisfied repaying an equal amount.

112
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:34,931
What are you doing?

113
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:40,914
I don't want to!

114
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:42,205
I don't want to!

115
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:44,448
I don't want to!

116
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:03,259
Am I that loathsome?

117
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,715
<i>Geum Jan Di, are you not going to school?</i>

118
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:43,444
I'm not going.

119
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:44,874
Do you want to get hit and then go to school
or go to school now?

120
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,465
I'm not going. Hit me.

121
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,135
<i>You, really!</i>

122
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:50,244
I'm not going!

123
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,084
I can't go!

124
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:53,104
I rather break the ice of Han river than go there.

125
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,704
I am not going to that school.

126
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:58,424
If want to see me die then force me to go.

127
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:01,154
- You,
- Isn't today a no school Saturday?*

128
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,141
<i>{\a6}*(In Korea, there's no school on 2nd & 4th Saturday every month)</i>

129
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:04,434
<i>Also,</i>

130
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:07,194
An ahjussi told me to give this to you.

131
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:09,455
<i>What's this?</i>

132
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:10,735
What?

133
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:13,709
<i>{\a6}[Invitation: Hello, I want to invite all of you to my
home for my 23rd birthday. Please attend. "Min Seo Hyun"]</i>

134
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,315
Party?

135
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,485
<i>Party?</i>

136
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:21,458
Then that means our Jan Di is
finally making her way into society!

137
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:23,644
<i>Oh, Honey!</i>

138
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,694
<i>Honey! Honey!</i>

139
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:28,064
Let me see.

140
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,354
Hurry, give it to me.

141
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:30,884
We shouldn't be like this right now.

142
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:31,884
Dress.

143
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:33,964
Honey, dress, dress.

144
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:36,089
Dress.

145
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:09,134
I'm sorry Jan Di, your father is useless.

146
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:12,715
I can't even provide my daughter with a proper dress.

147
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,364
This poor neighborhood

148
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:18,355
can't even bring in one decent outfit.

149
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:21,904
Can't she wear this hanbok?

150
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:24,674
Is she going to visit her in-laws for New Years?

151
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:27,537
They are having a party, party.

152
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:29,874
Usually, at a time like this,

153
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,325
in dramas the prince would always buy an outfit.

154
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:37,058
Hello.

155
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:40,829
This is Ms. Min Seo Hyun's gift to Geum Jan Di.

156
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,265
This!

157
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,303
This is pretty.

158
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,354
<i>- She should be wearing it like this right?
- Yes ,yes.</i>

159
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:55,685
<i>Pull it down a bit.</i>

160
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:16,604
Why didn't you call me for your last exhibition?

161
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:18,924
You said you would contact us, but you never did.

162
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,754
It's the same with me.

163
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:24,074
Who did you come with today?

164
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:26,224
<i>It seems like you don't have a partner.
Why don't I be yours?</i>

165
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,454
Why are you like that?
I already set my sights on him.

166
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,244
<i>Don't touch him!</i>

167
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,644
<i>- What are you doing?
- You are really funny.</i>

168
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:33,685
Excuse me for a while, sorry.

169
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,754
Honey, why are you so late?

170
00:20:36,755 --> 00:20:39,045
Why did you get here so late?

171
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,225
Why are you here?

172
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,845
It's because Seo Hyun unni invited me here.

173
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:54,685
Did you empty a department store?

174
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,455
She came late last time too.

175
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,084
Geum Jan Di,

176
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:01,425
she's pretty when she's dressed up.

177
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:02,444
<i>Right, right.</i>

178
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:05,014
You look the cutest here today.

179
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,845
Who's cute?

180
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,854
Can a pumpkin turn into a
watermelon by drawing lines on it?

181
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:13,854
Gu Jun Pyo,

182
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,170
actually said the right idiom.

183
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:10,654
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

184
00:22:10,655 --> 00:22:14,354
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

185
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:18,814
<i>Happy birthday dear, Min Seo Hyun.</i>

186
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:23,302
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

187
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:45,217
<i>Thank you everyone for attending
my 23rd birthday celebration.</i>

188
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:48,915
I would like to thank my dad and mom for their care.

189
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,356
And the love of my friends.

190
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:57,395
<i>I want to use this gathering to tell you something.</i>

191
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:03,534
That's why I'm having party,
which isn't like me.

192
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:06,065
Where did that punk Ji Hoo go?

193
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,448
Are they announcing their engagement?

194
00:23:09,877 --> 00:23:12,375
I will be returning to Paris next week,

195
00:23:14,145 --> 00:23:16,341
and I don't think I'm coming back.

196
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:21,885
My modeling firm and I have arranged everything.

197
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,255
What is she saying?

198
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:32,014
Thanks to my parents, I can enjoy life
without having to work hard.

199
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:37,138
But I want to use my own abilities,
so I'm choosing a new road.

200
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,435
I won't be inheriting my parents' law firm.

201
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,535
What I want is,

202
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:51,013
a life where I'm able to experience a broader world.

203
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:56,865
If I didn't do this,

204
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:59,964
I don't think I would've been able to
convince the people around me.

205
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:01,825
So I set this stage...

206
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:06,961
Everyone,

207
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:09,675
you must be happy.

208
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,455
Min Seo Hyun, really is a bomb full of surprises.

209
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:31,734
Ji Hoo,

210
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:33,065
did he already know about this?

211
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:37,995
Now we know why he's been depressed all this time.

212
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:39,494
So cool.

213
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:41,704
Really is cool, but...

214
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:43,846
what about Ji Hoo?

215
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:02,067
Hello.

216
00:25:05,865 --> 00:25:08,148
You still have it.

217
00:25:10,115 --> 00:25:13,661
That was the first summer
we spent apart from each other.

218
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:19,113
You still remember.

219
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:23,411
It's from that time onwards,

220
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:26,915
that you stopped calling me "Noona."

221
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:29,766
What am I to you?

222
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:39,055
Our Ji Hoo is really angry.

223
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:46,414
I feel like I'm being thrown away.

224
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:49,755
If there's anything here
that can't be thrown away...

225
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,005
it's you.

226
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:55,674
Don't lie to me!

227
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:57,535
If I was lying,

228
00:25:57,655 --> 00:26:01,585
I wouldn't mind you looking at other women.

229
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:04,734
What do you mean?

230
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:07,593
When you ran towards that girl,

231
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:11,042
I didn't understand why my heart suddenly sank.

232
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,929
It's funny, right?

233
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:17,021
I'm not in the mood to listen to you joke around.

234
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:21,289
I felt pleased, however.

235
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:26,934
I didn't know when our Ji Hoo became a man.

236
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:28,970
Don't joke!

237
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:36,215
You always do what you want.

238
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:38,054
I can't stay close, nor can I stay away.

239
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,305
You'll wind me up one day,
then ignore me another day.

240
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:42,465
I'm only a toy.

241
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:48,322
If I lost you, I wouldn't be able to sleep.

242
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,264
Then tell me who is looking at whom?

243
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:55,775
For the past 15 years, I've only looked at you.
Isn't that enough?

244
00:26:55,895 --> 00:26:57,505
I'm also a man.

245
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,205
I want to hold you,

246
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:02,709
like a man.

247
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:13,926
I know.

248
00:27:14,785 --> 00:27:17,435
I'm sorry, Ji Hoo.

249
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:21,688
I'm really sorry.

250
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:18,825
<i>If you faint here, it will really be embarrassing.</i>

251
00:28:18,945 --> 00:28:21,695
It's not like you to faint.

252
00:28:22,245 --> 00:28:24,734
You know that, right?

253
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,300
Who's going to faint?

254
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:38,114
Jan Di, you came.

255
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:40,974
Since you came, why didn't you come in?

256
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,465
That... so...

257
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:52,445
I wanted to say thank you.
I was about to go in.

258
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,414
The party is boring, right?

259
00:28:55,415 --> 00:28:58,614
We are going for a drive.

260
00:28:58,615 --> 00:28:59,725
Do you want to come with us?

261
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,995
Eh?

262
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,094
No, it's okay.

263
00:29:06,095 --> 00:29:08,035
We have another place to go.

264
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,709
We?

265
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,770
Yes.

266
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,046
This punk and I,

267
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,450
we're also going for a drive.

268
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,260
Drive! We are going for a drive!

269
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,790
Seo Hyun unni, goodbye.

270
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,761
I will see you later.

271
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,679
Let's go!

272
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,339
Unni!

273
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,609
I have paid my debt.

274
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,599
What?

275
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,729
You saved me from the pool.

276
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,759
I'm your savior!

277
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,340
How can you repay me this way?

278
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,069
Do you want to go back?

279
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,390
10%.

280
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,810
You have repaid that much.

281
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,380
50%.

282
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,831
25%.

283
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,446
Oh, this is great.

284
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,817
But why isn't there a single customer?

285
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,455
They were chased away.

286
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,429
Why?

287
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,325
I booked this place till morning.
Just do what you want.

288
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,340
What do I want to do?

289
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,690
To cry or to scream out.

290
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,987
We can call in the security guards outside
if you want to beat up someone.

291
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,632
But why would I want to do that?

292
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,201
After you saw Ji Hoo and Seo Hyun,
didn't you feel that your heart was breaking?

293
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,960
Oh, that's impossible.

294
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,810
No, a person like me could never
be Min Seo Hyun unni's rival.

295
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,608
I'm not pretty.

296
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,930
My brain is bad as well.

297
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,700
My family is really poor too.

298
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,772
There's nothing great about your figure either.
Your temper is really bad.

299
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,310
Right.

300
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,788
So how could such a messed up person
be jealous of Min Seo Hyun?!

301
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,570
I didn't have the qualifications from the start.

302
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,170
Although there's no comparison,

303
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,676
you're not the messed up one.

304
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,999
You have the qualifications.

305
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,814
What?

306
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,839
Ji Hoo, that fool.

307
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,595
If he had met you first instead of Seo Hyun,

308
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,913
he would have liked you for sure.

309
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,333
Are you sincere?

310
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,589
Family... your looks too.

311
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,726
Your brains... though all of these are zero,

312
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,793
you are the first woman
recognized by Gu Jun Pyo.

313
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,110
Your qualifications get full marks.

314
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,932
I have to go to the washroom.

315
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,200
It's really hot.

316
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,327
I'm really warm and thirsty.

317
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,075
Water...

318
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,993
I really did everything.

319
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,798
Hey, Dry cleaner.

320
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,808
Hey, what's wrong?

321
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,539
And so, why is she like this?

322
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,845
Well, look here.

323
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,438
- She drank it all?
- Yes...

324
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,490
Hey!

325
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,645
Hey, get a hold on yourself woman!

326
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,153
Woman...

327
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,199
Right...

328
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,796
I'm a woman.

329
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,929
An ordinary commoner is not a woman?!

330
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:06,450
With no background, looks nor brains.

331
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,560
I know it all too.

332
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,869
<i>There was no need for you to be so frank.</i>

333
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:18,136
I feel it every day within my bones, you jerk.

334
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,410
Jerk?

335
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,939
No...

336
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,649
No...

337
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,643
I...

338
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,595
I have no time to be thinking these things.

339
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,723
Actually, I'm a busy person who has lots of work to do.

340
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:43,829
I don't have the appropriate birth right,
but I have to attend such an aristocratic school.

341
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,890
Being bullied by others.

342
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:50,749
I have to work part-time jobs because
my dad often gets into trouble.

343
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,059
The school fees.

344
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,370
And I have to make time to swim for my scholarship.

345
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,680
I..

346
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:06,550
I haven't the time to accompany rich boys
like you to play the game of love.

347
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,125
You alcoholic.

348
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,470
Hey, gangster!

349
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,460
Wake up!

350
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,018
<i>Ah!</i>

351
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,019
I...

352
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,012
am a little sad today.

353
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,269
I'm a little upset.

354
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,749
Gu Jun Pyo, you punk.

355
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,220
Why are you smiling?

356
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,319
I feel good.

357
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,019
I'll let you off this once.

358
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,546
50.

359
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,629
I'll give you a discount since you saved my life.

360
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,599
Thank you, Gu Jun Pyo.

361
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,128
You saved me today.

362
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,644
I can't do anything for you, so instead...

363
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,763
I know that this place must be
really expensive just by its smell.

364
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,123
<i>You are a complete wipeout.</i>

365
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,539
How did I become like this?

366
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,840
Why am I here?

367
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,810
I brought you here.

368
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:38,369
I'm asking you, why am I at
my place instead of yours!?

369
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,516
Don't you remember?

370
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,439
It's a world famous brand.

371
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,089
It's a Gucci designed by the Milan designers.

372
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,220
It was first shown in their
new Spring/Summer collections.

373
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,724
<i>It just arrived the day before, by air from Milan.</i>

374
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:07,160
<i>- The price is...
- Enough...</i>

375
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,096
You want to scare her?

376
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:20,349
I don't feel like hearing you gloat
about your clothes right now.

377
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,479
That was the suit that I wore yesterday.

378
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,049
Why does the suit you wore
yesterday concern me at all?!

379
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,690
I wore it for the first time yesterday.

380
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,740
But it became the last time
I'll be wearing it, because of who?

381
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,261
Did you remember a little right now?

382
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,939
You came to my place of course,
since you were in that condition.

383
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,024
If not, did you want to go back home?

384
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,729
Sorry...

385
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,080
I already made a call to inform your parents.

386
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,049
It seems that they aren't worried about you.

387
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,829
Then, I'll be leaving now.

388
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,180
Sorry for creating so much trouble.

389
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,146
It's best that you go back to being yourself.

390
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,620
Sir...

391
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,779
- What's up?
- Madam, she...

392
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,432
What about that witch?

393
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,727
She has already arrived.

394
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,591
So early?

395
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,573
Why is she here so early?

396
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,360
Where is Jun Pyo?

397
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,759
On the second floor.

398
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,399
I have to make him help out with the event.

399
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,480
Arrange someone to follow him,
so that he doesn't slip away.

400
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,194
<i>I got it.</i>

401
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,361
<i>What are you doing?</i>

402
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,639
Hey, emergency!

403
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,389
What?

404
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,040
The witch came back suddenly.

405
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,629
Jan Di is in my room right now.

406
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,579
I have no way of getting her out.

407
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,969
What?

408
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,529
Jun Pyo, once she finds out...

409
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,624
You are finished.

410
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,109
There is a strange girl in my son's room.

411
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,749
And it's just a "Geum Jan Di."

412
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,739
<i>How is she going to react?</i>

413
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,049
It's really making me curious.

414
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,720
<i>Tomorrow morning...</i>

415
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,219
Jun Pyo...

416
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,470
is going to be sent to Alaska.

417
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,860
$1000

418
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,490
Me?

419
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,289
Dispatched to Se Jong base, $3000

420
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,429
But first, she'll employ a hit-man.

421
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,709
What?

422
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,383
Really?

423
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,912
She is that scary?

424
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,819
When we went to summer camp in sixth grade,
we escaped that day.

425
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,829
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

426
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,009
<i>We really almost died that day.</i>

427
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,055
<i>So how could we forget about it?</i>

428
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,923
<i>Don't move!</i>

429
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,250
<i>Bonjour. Noona.</i>

430
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,989
<i>You are Yi Jung, right?</i>

431
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,755
How can you be so good-looking?

432
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,594
Noona, you are Korea's Vivian.

433
00:42:42,595 --> 00:42:44,024
Everyone has been saying it.

434
00:42:44,025 --> 00:42:45,708
What do you want? Say it quickly.

435
00:42:46,365 --> 00:42:48,222
What do you want from me?

436
00:42:48,595 --> 00:42:49,624
You knew it...

437
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,900
That's why I like you so much.

438
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,250
<i>The Seoul branch has sent over the concept
application of helping kids with kidney stones.</i>

439
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,184
Reject.

440
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:03,824
The education resources,
and Shinhwa school too.

441
00:43:03,825 --> 00:43:05,042
Reject.

442
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,614
You didn't let Jun Pyo escape, right?

443
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:10,615
<i>Yes.</i>

444
00:44:06,395 --> 00:44:07,551
Who is she?

445
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:09,890
Hello.

446
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,694
She's my guest, so it's none of your business.

447
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:16,464
She's my guest as well
since she's come to my home.

448
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:18,152
<i>Isn't that so, Miss?</i>

449
00:44:19,595 --> 00:44:21,470
She is our friend.

450
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:24,013
Friend?

451
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,774
Yes, she's our school junior.

452
00:44:26,775 --> 00:44:30,854
We let her join F4 specially as our mascot,
because she looks so cute.

453
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:32,592
Well, it's like that.

454
00:44:33,075 --> 00:44:35,471
Which family's daughter are you?

455
00:44:36,948 --> 00:44:40,018
- I'm...
- What work does your father do?

456
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:43,686
- My father is...
- He's a businessman.

457
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:47,794
Yes, is that so?

458
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:48,524
What kind?

459
00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:50,584
Well, clothes.

460
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,884
No, no... The fashion business.

461
00:44:52,885 --> 00:44:56,053
He's quite famous in the clothing world.

462
00:44:58,505 --> 00:44:59,620
That's quite interesting.

463
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:02,874
And so, are you interested in today's auction?

464
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:05,294
Yes, not only is she interested.

465
00:45:05,295 --> 00:45:10,673
She brought with her Bella Song's new work
which will be the dark horse for the auction tonight.

466
00:45:13,955 --> 00:45:17,434
It looks like your mother has very good taste.

467
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:19,761
What work does she do?

468
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:25,871
Chairman, it's time to welcome the guests.

469
00:45:26,735 --> 00:45:29,635
Jun Pyo, you stay behind to guard your position.

470
00:45:30,058 --> 00:45:31,314
<i>You guys too...</i>

471
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:34,335
It's for a good cause, help out as well.

472
00:45:34,795 --> 00:45:36,066
Yes...

473
00:45:50,385 --> 00:45:52,604
How can you lie?

474
00:45:52,605 --> 00:45:54,708
How are we going to do damage control?

475
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:58,099
We should have told her the truth.

476
00:45:58,845 --> 00:46:03,312
Then be honest by saying that your dad runs a dry cleaner
and your mom operates a public bath?

477
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:08,264
But then, not only you, but your family as well,
will encounter things no one can guarantee.

478
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,334
You will lose your life once she singles you out.

479
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,936
This is not a joke.

480
00:46:16,795 --> 00:46:18,183
That...

481
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,200
is it hereditary?

482
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:29,844
<i>The auction item this time,</i>

483
00:46:29,845 --> 00:46:32,454

484
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:33,694
<i>The item is now here!</i>

485
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:35,134
Everyone's attention on it please.

486
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:37,335
The auction item this time is...

487
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:42,575
Marine Boy Swimmer, Park Tae Hwan's goggles.

488
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:46,477
Swimmer Park Tae Hwan's goggles?

489
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:03,611
<i>Now, the starting price is from 500,000 Won.</i>

490
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:05,735
1 million.

491
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:07,485
<i>1 million Won is called out.</i>

492
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,671
2 million.

493
00:47:08,673 --> 00:47:11,405
2 million Won is called out.

494
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,673
7 million.

495
00:47:12,675 --> 00:47:14,554
7 million Won is called out.

496
00:47:14,555 --> 00:47:17,044
Now is anyone willing to pay 7.5 million Won?

497
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:18,764
8 million.

498
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:21,074
8 million Won is called out.

499
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:25,128
Is there anyone for 8.5 million Won?

500
00:47:26,275 --> 00:47:28,790
Yes, 8.5 million Won.

501
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,814
10 million Won over here.

502
00:47:32,815 --> 00:47:34,364
<i>Yes, 10 million Won!</i>

503
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:39,535
<i>Just now, someone telephoned
with a bid of 10 million Won!</i>

504
00:47:39,885 --> 00:47:41,894
Is there anyone who wants to bid a higher price?

505
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:43,324
<i>If there isn't, then...</i>

506
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:45,664
Then the auction is going to close.

507
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:46,954
One!

508
00:47:46,955 --> 00:47:48,024
<i>Two!</i>

509
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:48,915
Three!

510
00:47:51,115 --> 00:47:54,245
<i>The deal is sealed for 10 million won.</i>

511
00:47:58,215 --> 00:48:00,244
<i>The auction item this time...</i>

512
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:01,924
Everyone's attention please be on it.

513
00:48:01,925 --> 00:48:03,284
It's now here.

<i>The auction item this time,

<i>The starting price is 5 million Won.</i>

518
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:44,964
<i>The auction item this time, is the Pavioni suit
worn by Gu Jun Pyo of the Shinhwa group.</i>

519
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:49,994
<i>The suit's most highlighted aspect is it's so light,
you feel as though you're not wearing it.</i>

520
00:48:49,995 --> 00:48:52,245
<i>The starting price for it is from 10 million won.</i>

521
00:48:52,835 --> 00:48:54,824
<i>Yes, 10 million Won is called out.</i>

00:49:33,195 --> 00:49:34,654
<i>What are you doing? Let's go quickly.</i>

527
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:35,865
Your turn is next.

528
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:40,530
<i>If you wear it for 10 years, it'll still
be elegant as though you just bought it.</i>

529
00:49:40,535 --> 00:49:47,490
<i>25 million won! Anyone for 30 million?
Yes, there's 30 million won!</i>

530
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:50,454
The auction item this time
is really brightening eyes.

531
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:55,482
<i>- Bella Song's new collection.
- I can't do it. I can't, just this once.</i>

532
00:50:25,225 --> 00:50:27,194
<i>Everyone, please pay attention.</i>

533
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:32,184
<i>The pale elegant lemon yellow
will highlight your attractiveness.</i>

534
00:50:32,185 --> 00:50:37,294
The shining gold accessories on the
dress will increase your elegance.

535
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:42,420
Bella Song new design's starting
price will be 10 million Won.

536
00:50:43,055 --> 00:50:45,155
<i>Yes, 10 million Won, going once!</i>

537
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:50,224
<i>How about 15 million Won?
Yes! 15 million is called.</i>

538
00:50:50,225 --> 00:50:52,919
What has Jun Pyo been doing lately?

539
00:50:53,245 --> 00:50:55,764
He's more well-behaved these days.

540
00:50:55,765 --> 00:50:57,859
<i>And he is taking school more seriously.</i>

541
00:51:00,115 --> 00:51:01,945
Then, do you know that female student?

542
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:05,284
<i>Bella Song's eye catching new dress,</i>

543
00:51:05,285 --> 00:51:08,162
<i>will transform you perfectly. Now...</i>

544
00:51:08,475 --> 00:51:10,881
I finally meet the famous wonder girl.

545
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:12,656
I'm happy to meet you.

546
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:17,510
I wasn't the one who pushed him, really.

547
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,534
<i>Assistant Kim.</i>

548
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,784
Yes...

549
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:25,465
According to what I know, she is a
transfer student at Shinhwa High School.

550
00:51:27,725 --> 00:51:30,579
Check out which family's daughter she is.

551
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:32,114
I got it.

552
00:51:32,115 --> 00:51:37,945
<i>The feel of the fabric of Bella Song's new design
will make you look more glamorous.</i>

553
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:43,675
<i>This is the dress that's really
popular this season in Paris.</i>

554
00:51:46,945 --> 00:51:47,644
<i>Oh, my.</i>

555
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:48,954
Is this for real?

556
00:51:48,955 --> 00:51:51,744
Are these the goggles that
Park Tae Hwan used before?

557
00:51:53,135 --> 00:51:56,104
Hey, this is not a joke at all.

558
00:51:56,105 --> 00:51:58,755
Noona, Noona, you are going to be rich for sure.

559
00:51:59,195 --> 00:52:01,824
Superbly rich this time.

560
00:52:01,825 --> 00:52:03,324
What again?

561
00:52:03,325 --> 00:52:08,129
Park Tae Hwan's goggles will fetch you
2 million Won if you were to sell them.

562
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:10,134
2 million Won?

563
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:12,034
<i>A pair of goggles are worth 2 million Won?</i>

564
00:52:12,035 --> 00:52:13,784
Sell them, sell them right now.

565
00:52:13,785 --> 00:52:16,087
Where else can you get 2 million Won?

566
00:52:16,445 --> 00:52:18,616
No, these are really expensive!

567
00:52:22,065 --> 00:52:24,914
Well, what I meant is...

568
00:52:24,915 --> 00:52:29,584
Their worth can't be measured with money.

569
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:31,124
I meant that.

570
00:52:32,475 --> 00:52:34,794
Sell them! 2 million, 2 million!

571
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:36,524
We are selling them even if it's 20,000!

572
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:38,964
I really don't know what you are thinking about.

573
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:40,450
Oh, really...

574
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:44,367
But still, selling them is a little...

575
00:52:46,215 --> 00:52:48,185
I don't care anymore.

576
00:52:49,075 --> 00:52:50,808
Good night.

577
00:52:52,675 --> 00:52:54,094
Jan Di!

578
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:56,194
Hey, girl!

579
00:52:56,195 --> 00:52:59,718
Wait, look at her. Don't block me, hey!

580
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:34,832
I'm leaving.

581
00:53:35,265 --> 00:53:37,505
Anyway, thank you.

582
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:38,724
What?

583
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:40,274
I can't hear it.

584
00:53:42,045 --> 00:53:43,154
Thank you.

585
00:53:43,155 --> 00:53:44,154
What?

586
00:53:44,155 --> 00:53:46,047
I said, thank you!!

587
00:53:47,275 --> 00:53:50,154
Just a simple "thank you" would've been enough.
Why did you have to add on "anyway"?

588
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,634
That's right, you are rather prideful
since you are a commoner.

589
00:53:53,635 --> 00:53:55,974
You were pretending when you'd heard me already.

590
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:56,674
Cancelled.

591
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:57,804
What?

592
00:53:57,805 --> 00:54:00,225
I'm canceling my thank you.

593
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:04,174
That's right, people won't change that easily.

594
00:54:04,175 --> 00:54:05,914
I'm leaving.

595
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:08,154
Hey, Jandi baht*...
(*grass field)

596
00:54:08,155 --> 00:54:09,480
What?!

597
00:54:12,825 --> 00:54:15,169
Don't you ever drink when I'm not around.

598
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:24,083
Seo Hyun unni, why are you here?

599
00:57:25,665 --> 00:57:29,081
I came here because I had
to process my school withdrawal.

600
00:57:29,895 --> 00:57:34,384
I wanted to see you one more time before I leave,
so I came here to try my luck.

601
00:57:34,385 --> 00:57:35,905
I was lucky.

602
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:37,806
Leaving school?

603
00:57:38,845 --> 00:57:41,262
You really aren't returning?

604
00:57:43,955 --> 00:57:45,223
I'm afraid so.

605
00:57:45,585 --> 00:57:47,357
When will you be leaving?

606
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,169
Tomorrow.

607
00:57:50,565 --> 00:57:52,713
Why so soon?

608
00:57:56,745 --> 00:58:00,810
There's no time to say thanks to you.

609
00:58:01,555 --> 00:58:05,071
I still haven't returned the favors I owe you.

610
00:58:06,325 --> 00:58:09,810
I'll be really disappointed if
you keep saying things like that.

611
00:58:14,345 --> 00:58:17,186
I knew from the first time we met,

612
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:23,004
you are the person that our Ji Hoo
always smiles when mentioning.

613
00:58:23,005 --> 00:58:25,715
It's you, Jan Di.

614
00:59:10,405 --> 00:59:12,609
Well, Unni.

615
00:59:23,405 --> 00:59:24,785
<i>Jan Di...</i>

616
00:59:25,155 --> 00:59:26,569
What are you doing?

617
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,292
I was a fan of yours for a very
long time, even before I met you.

618
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:41,549
And so, I understand why you made
such a decision more than many others. But still...

619
00:59:44,725 --> 00:59:49,218
I'm begging you not to leave.

620
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:53,587
Get up quickly.

621
00:59:54,735 --> 00:59:59,904
I know really well that I'm not qualified to beg
you and there's no reason for you to listen.

622
00:59:59,905 --> 01:00:03,537
But I don't know what to do besides this.

623
01:00:04,115 --> 01:00:06,921
Is it because of Ji Hoo?

624
01:00:13,665 --> 01:00:17,323
I don't know anything at all about Ji Hoo sunbae.

625
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:20,389
<i>But...</i>

626
01:00:23,195 --> 01:00:25,455
<i>I know,</i>

627
01:00:28,115 --> 01:00:31,505
<i>how precious you are to him.</i>

628
01:00:36,995 --> 01:00:41,511
When I see him, why does he
always have an unknown sadness?

629
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:44,819
<i>But he will still smile sometimes,</i>

630
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:51,774
and can melt other people's hearts.

631
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:54,010
It is really warm.

632
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:01,046
Unni, you are the only person
that can make him smile.

633
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:05,434
If you are to leave like this,

634
01:01:05,435 --> 01:01:09,631
there's a possibility he may never smile again.

635
01:01:16,705 --> 01:01:19,096
<i>Just get up quickly.</i>

636
01:01:30,275 --> 01:01:32,111
Jan Di...

637
01:01:33,185 --> 01:01:41,403
Whatever decisions I've made
are similar to shopping overseas.

638
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:47,393
There won't be another chance
if I don't remain firm at that moment.

639
01:01:49,255 --> 01:01:54,254
I know clearly how cruel those feelings of regrets are.

640
01:01:58,155 --> 01:02:02,531
Ji Hoo is a really precious person to me as well.

641
01:02:03,545 --> 01:02:06,501
I believe he feels the same way too.

642
01:02:08,115 --> 01:02:14,147
And so, I feel that Ji Hoo wouldn't want
to see me living with regrets as well.

643
01:02:15,675 --> 01:02:17,639
How do you feel about this?

644
01:02:20,605 --> 01:02:25,094
Sorry. I'm sorry.

645
01:02:26,935 --> 01:02:32,787
No, I'm really happy that you
are telling me these things.

646
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,939
Thanks.

647
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,693
Unni...

648
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,786
Oh, wait.

649
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:51,561
You are going to give me these?

650
01:02:52,145 --> 01:02:54,064
I told you before, right?

651
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:55,875
Shoes are the most important things.

652
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:02,153
I hope that these shoes will bring
you to a good place for sure.

653
01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:09,218
I have something to request from you as well.

654
01:03:10,465 --> 01:03:15,895
Let our Ji Hoo regain his smile again.

655
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,752
What are you doing?

656
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:42,983
Who are you to do this kind of thing?

657
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:46,737
Did anyone ask for that kind of favor?

658
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:51,210
That isn't even a favor. It's groveling.

659
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,164
Don't you have any pride?

660
01:03:55,475 --> 01:03:58,148
It's not because I don't have pride.

661
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:04,526
It's because you were hurting too much.

662
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:08,294
Because you were about to die from sadness.

663
01:04:08,295 --> 01:04:10,044
What does it matter to you?

664
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,414
It has nothing to do with you, does it?

665
01:04:18,015 --> 01:04:19,614
Get lost.

<i>Tell me what a real man is like?</i>

674
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:51,905
A man who is responsible from the beginning 'till the end.

675
01:04:52,265 --> 01:04:54,894
<i>Geum Jan Di, you and I...</i>

676
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:57,694
No, this is impossible!

677
01:04:57,695 --> 01:05:01,397
Mom, Dad, please forgive me.

678
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:04,995
Isn't he the heir of Shinhwa group?

679
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:06,974
<i>It's the next flight.</i>

680
01:05:06,975 --> 01:05:10,794
<i>Luckily both of us are on the flight.</i>

681
01:05:10,795 --> 01:05:12,974
<i>When do we have the right to love freely?</i>

682
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,544
The final decision lies in the hands of our parents.

683
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:17,370
You haven't forgotten it, right?

684
01:05:17,765 --> 01:05:20,034
<i>You only talk about being a real man?</i>

685
01:05:20,035 --> 01:05:24,145
Is it true between you and F4's Gu Jun Pyo?

686
01:05:24,595 --> 01:05:28,299
To lie to Senior Jun Pyo is
equivalent to lying to all of us.

687
01:05:30,135 --> 01:05:31,729
Geum Jan Di...

688
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:34,981
