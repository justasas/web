{\a6}Episode 19

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,070
You again...!

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,840
We're so right for each other!!

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,070
I had a feeling that if I suddenly
came home I would see you.

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,570
Did you fry and eat your cell phone?

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,660
Call and ask for permission before
going to someone else's house.

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,890
Did you not learn that?

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,630
Ugh, I'm so tired.

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,340
Thinking back... I don't
think I ever learned that.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,340
<i>Just like you.</i>

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,850
Hey, Monkey get up!

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,630
Why are you laying on someone else's bed?

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,310
Get up fast!

17
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,920
Get up!

18
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,430
<i>I said get up!</i>

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,280
Do you wanna bet with me?

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,090
What bet!?

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,710
<i>Oh, no! Oh, no!</i>

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,570
Win!

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,430
Oh, no! Oh, no!

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,260
Yay! I won!

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,170
I'm not going to go easy on you.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,870
Win! Fighting!

27
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,660
I won again! Yeah!

28
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,730
I'm not playing anymore.

29
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,480
The buttons don't work! What is this...

30
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,850
Hey!

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,260
Stop drinking, you won't
get better if you continue.

32
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,320
Get better?

33
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,990
Get better and do what.

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,020
What if I don't do pottery for awhile?

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,570
I can just toy with girls anyway.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,590
Don't you think?

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,660
Yi Jung you've coped well all this time,
why are you doing this?

38
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,300
Sir, your Mother again...

39
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,400
What happened?

40
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,820
She's at the hospital and
she wants to see you.

41
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,030
Tell her I'm busy.

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,490
Where are you going?

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,220
If you don't want to see
me go crazy, let me go.

44
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,300
Ga Eul.

45
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,910
You said you wanted a date with me right?

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,840
Am I still eligible for that date?

47
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:34,060
If you're going to leave after this
then you shouldn't have asked for a date.

48
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,660
You still haven't seen the highlight yet.

49
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,070
You said your name was Ga Eul right?

50
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,300
Eat plenty because the
Foie Gras* here is the best.

51
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:05,301
{\a6}*French food product made of
duck/goose liver.

52
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,690
Thank you.

53
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,200
It seems like you fancy Ga Eul.

54
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,300
She's cute and innocent
what isn't there to like.

55
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,000
I guess I am similar to you father.

56
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,500
Even though Mother is at the hospital,

57
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,600
<i>you have your son dating,</i>

58
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,540
and you yourself offering
foie gras to cute girls

59
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,290
even when mother is dying in the hospital.

60
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,350
I guess we can't fool our blood.

61
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,900
Let's keep our household
stories for later...

62
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,370
What should we talk about then?

63
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,790
I think this young lady is of your taste,
should I lend her to you?

64
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,380
Yi Jung sunbae!

65
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,590
Why so serious?

66
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,970
Her age is similar to that girl from before.

67
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,700
How about it Ga Eul?

68
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,240
My dad is alright isn't he?

69
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,620
Please excuse me.

70
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,300
Today you crossed the line son.

71
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Why did we come here?

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,380
The loser shall be quiet or
did you forget our bet?

73
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,300
Today, you promised to be my servant.

74
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,620
What! When?!

75
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,790
Wow...!

76
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,250
What I hate most is someone that says
"Two things with one mouth".

77
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,880
A man must always keep his word.

78
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,780
Do you not know that saying?

79
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,150
A man must always keep his word?

80
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,200
So hush and follow me.

81
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,170
A man must always keep his word...?

82
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,290
A man must always keep his word!

83
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,630
Hey. Why are you buying that many?

84
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,610
Hey, hey, hey!

85
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,830
HEY!

86
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,010
- I don't want to eat it.
- Just one bite!

87
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,730
<i>It's good right?</i>

88
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,530
Yeahhh sure.

89
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,300
<i>It's good?</i>

90
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,940
Wow, you're so pretty
you look great with him.

91
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,390
Thank you!

92
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,440
Did you hear that? I'm pretty!

93
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,830
You believe that?

94
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,400
Thank you!

95
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,840
He's just trying to sell these.

96
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,350
<i>Oh, Sir it's not that.</i>

97
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,020
No, he's not!

98
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,820
Thank you...

99
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,020
HEY!

100
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,410
Hey Monkey here..

101
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,270
Jan Di said she moved and she's
with her brother so yeah.

102
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,060
Come on let's go!

103
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,680
Here you go.

104
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,370
I just received today as well...

105
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,340
Today I also received.

106
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,810
Do you want to come in and have some tea?

107
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,970
I can give you some green tea.

108
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,270
Ahh...

109
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,270
Grandfather...

110
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,660
The Sir left already of course.

111
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,270
Just wait, I'll get the tea ready.

112
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,250
<i>Ji Hoo is this fun?</i>

113
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,420
Yes, Grandfather!

114
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,890
Let's go fishing now!

115
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,430
I will fish a big big shark!

116
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,350
Fishing? Sure Ji Hoo.

117
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,880
When should we go?

118
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,490
Right now!

119
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,460
Sure, let's go!

120
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,990
Wahhh the smell is incredible.

121
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,640
Me first!

122
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,630
What!

123
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,700
If I let you be you're going to pour
all this down in the blink of an eye!

124
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>Pour all this down?</i>

125
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,280
Dongseng, this woman here is a food god.

126
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,790
Block her now.

127
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,070
What, you can't be like that now!
Did you forget who bought this!?

128
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,620
Just eat that, just eat that!

129
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,620
Hey, hey!

130
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,950
HEY!

131
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,970
Why aren't you eating?

132
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,460
Well because I always eat ramen.

133
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,160
Aside from ramen then,
what would you want to eat?

134
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,910
Pizza!

135
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,170
Pizza for days until I grow bored of it
and I won't have any more cravings!

136
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,010
What kind of a guy has a wish like that?

137
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,650
Ah, don't eat this, eat something good.

138
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,360
Ughh, I'm so full.

139
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,390
Why isn't Jan Di coming?

140
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,470
Hey Dongseng call her!

141
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,460
She doesn't have a cell phone.

142
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,950
WHAT! She doesn't have a cellphone!?

143
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,440
Well she gave it to my parents so
they can call during emergencies.

144
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,010
Ugh... you guys..

145
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,320
Ohhh so that's how it is.

146
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,190
Let's go!

147
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,130
Where now?

148
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,870
What!

149
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,390
Come here quick.

150
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,790
Hello.

151
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,940
Can you give me this one?

152
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,410
This product. Okay, please wait.

153
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,460
It's this one. It's this one!

154
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,800
- Sir show me this.
- Oh, we came for this too.

155
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,110
Hey!

156
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,630
Looks like you're working hard lately!

157
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,780
It's cool.

158
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,190
So the cellphone...

159
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,290
<i>Ji Hoo!</i>

160
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,170
Please excuse me.

161
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,410
Ji Hoo, I am sorry.

162
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,680
What?

163
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,100
It should be me who is sorry.

164
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,670
I killed your son...

165
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,370
and your son's wife.

166
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,100
And only the child survived.

167
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,190
It is not your fault.

168
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,740
Ji Hoo!

169
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,060
15 years.

170
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,050
15 years ago, you should've said that.

171
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,360
<i>Did you know that!?</i>

172
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:14,540
How long the child waited
for his grandfather?

173
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,690
Ji Hoo..

174
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,980
You didn't know did you?

175
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,220
How bad the child wanted
to cry on his grandfather.

176
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,530
Child...

177
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,190
Do not call me that again.

178
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,730
Ji Hoo!

179
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,820
Grandfather!

180
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,160
Grandfather, grandfather!

181
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,720
I am okay...

182
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,700
Go. Go and find him.

183
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,001
Find him.

184
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,430
Ji Hoo Sunbae!

185
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,510
Ji Hoo Sunbae!

186
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,540
Ji Hoo Sunbae!

187
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,270
Grandfather!

188
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,830
GRANDFATHER!

189
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,090
GRANDFATHER!

190
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,990
GRANDFATHER!

191
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,410
GRANDFATHER!

192
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,460
I was scared that child might cry.

193
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,360
Like his father...

194
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,300
Like his mother...

195
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,870
I was afraid that child
might cry because of me.

196
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,520
So I ran away.

197
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,500
What kind of woman are you
to spend the night out!

198
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,520
Oh.. that...

199
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,380
Why is he mad!?

200
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,510
Did I do something bad?

201
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,560
Hey, that's my lifestyle ok!

202
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,260
Do you not know what privacy is?

203
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,060
Hey Gum Jan Di if you're going
to use it, use it properly.

204
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,710
It is not privacy. It is p-r-i-d-e.

205
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,340
Do you not know pride?

206
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,190
What...!?

207
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,820
Hey, you! Where do you think you're
going when I'm still speaking?!

208
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,340
Privacy or Pride...

209
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,840
I'm GOING TO LOOK IT UP! WHY?

210
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,250
HEY! Are you not going to tell me
what you've been doing!?

211
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,250
<i>NO!!</i>

212
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,640
Not much has happened?

213
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,490
Yes.

214
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,150
And Jun Pyo?

215
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,960
He went to school.

216
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,170
And with Jae Kyung?

217
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,530
While you were gone,
she came to visit a lot,

218
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,470
and spent quite some time
with the Young Master.

219
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,030
That's fortunate.

220
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,560
But...

221
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,060
Don't you have anything else to tell me?

222
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,090
Pardon?

223
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,180
Chief Jung.

224
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,910
I understand that you're busy
taking care of things instead of me,

225
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,250
and although you understand that
Jun Pyo isn't an easy kid to manage...

226
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:25,100
Don't you know that things are
still unknowingly happening?

227
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,940
I'm sorry.

228
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,280
I was being careless.

229
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,380
Look into it immediately.

230
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,100
Yes, Ma'am.

231
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,080
You're really trying hard.

232
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,320
Why don't you return to
your neighborhood now?

233
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,850
I told you that this is all
part of the getting use

234
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,151
to the wild independent living experience.

235
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,310
Hey.

236
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,260
You ride your car in the morning and night,

237
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,970
go home to change your clothes, order meals.

238
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,620
Which part of this is independent and
which part is the wild living experience?

239
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,850
I sleep, I sleep!

240
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,580
With the cockroaches, and in a
booger-sized room infested with fleas.

241
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,850
These long legs are suffering,
what more do you expect?

242
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,320
Who told you to do that?

243
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,900
No one was expecting you to do that.

244
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,200
Stop making yourself suffer.

245
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,730
Are you really not going to tell me?

246
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,260
What?

247
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:03,730
I'm not curious about...
what... pride. No, privacy,

248
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,200
But it's because I'm like your
older brother or guardian...

249
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,790
HEY!

250
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,680
A human is talking to you.

251
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,400
Hey!

252
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,970
- Are you Geum Kang San?
- I am Geum Kang San.

253
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,060
Come this way.

254
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,670
[Kang San, Be Strong! ^^]

255
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,980
[Eat it all.]

256
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,130
Go ahead and eat to your heart's content.

257
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,930
Jun Pyo hyungnim?

258
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,080
Is it good?

259
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,930
Eat a lot.

260
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,690
Kang San! Me too! Me too!

261
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,890
Get in line!

262
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,720
Welcome.

263
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,730
Ji Hoo sunbae.

264
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,220
What are you doing here?

265
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,650
I went to Jan Di's.

266
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,970
Oh, you don't know yet.

267
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,180
Jan Di moved.

268
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,930
Moved?

269
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,860
You guys eat a lot too.

270
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,450
It's worrying me that it's quiet.

271
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,630
Hey! Why aren't you turning on?

272
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,950
Hey!

273
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,350
Chief Jung, why isn't this turning on?

274
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,230
What do you mean what?
I'm talking about the flame!

275
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,670
The flame's not turning on.

276
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,640
Hurry up and do something about it.

277
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,720
He came really fast.

278
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,340
Chief Jung...

279
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,990
<i>Let me go. I said let me go.</i>

280
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,110
Let go.

281
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,300
Let go.

282
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,700
<i>Let go.</i>

283
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,940
Kang San.

284
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,490
Hey.

285
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,700
Who is it?

286
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,890
Hi.

287
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,490
Hey, yo.

288
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,860
Sunbae!

289
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,390
What happened?

290
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,570
I heard you moved into a new house,

291
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,930
so we came for the housewarming party.

292
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,120
On a housewarming party the owner
is supposed to invite you for you to come.

293
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,150
But are you two really living in here?

294
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,900
It's a lot better than it looks.

295
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,480
It's quite and safe.

296
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,890
And...

297
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,480
The rent fee is really cheap.

298
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,180
Almost free.

299
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,430
But Jun Pyo...

300
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,520
<i>Excuse me.</i>

301
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,100
Who is it?

302
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,390
Geum Jan Di is popular.

303
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,540
Wait a second.

304
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,060
Who is it? Who is it?

305
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,380
How did you...

306
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,340
I almost want to disbelieve my eyes,

307
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,800
seeing you guys here in
the middle of the night.

308
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,860
Jun Pyo's not here.

309
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,310
I know where and what my son is doing.

310
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,100
What's your reason for coming here?

311
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,060
Shouldn't even a commoner know
that when an adult comes to visit,

312
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,690
the first thing you should do is
greet them and then invite them in.

313
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,570
This is why good upbringing is important.

314
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,940
Then, would you like to come inside?

315
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,520
No, thanks.

316
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,590
I'd rather stand outside than to lay
a foot inside a house like that.

317
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,200
I knew you weren't an ordinary girl,

318
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,680
but you sure do have a
talent in seducing men.

319
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,290
<i>President Jang.</i>

320
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,650
It's not like that.

321
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,770
If you feel victimized by
my misunderstanding,

322
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,440
why don't you try to justify yourself?

323
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,420
I'm not doing anything wrong
to be hearing things like these.

324
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,930
Over there.

325
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,920
I'm still suspicious even after I found
out who did what over there.

326
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,900
<i>After you called a man with a
fiancée to live next to you,</i>

327
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:23,070
What?

328
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,520
You're not doing anything wrong?

329
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,850
I really had nothing to do with that.

330
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,620
That was all done on Gu Jun Pyo's accord.

331
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,300
That's usually the excuse
that girls like you use.

332
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,450
The girl was doing nothing and the guy did
all of it, what's there to do about it?

333
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:50,110
So, I came to ask a favor.

334
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,370
If my Jun Pyo comes to see you,
please stop meeting him.

335
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,480
Like you said,

336
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,910
You and Jun Pyo...

337
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,650
are people who have nothing
to do with each other anymore.

338
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,330
I can trust you right?

339
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,910
Your great pride, I'll try to trust it.

340
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,170
This is why...

341
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,820
I'm against you meeting with my Jun Pyo.

342
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,340
For your family's sake,
please get things sorted out.

343
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,730
Let's go Chief Jung.

344
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,320
<i>Yes, Ma'am.</i>

345
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,330
Geum Jan Di.

346
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,750
There's no reason to take
Jun Pyo's mom's word to heart.

347
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,770
<i>She's always saying things like that.</i>

348
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,600
She's the same way with us.

349
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,860
But what's this about Jun Pyo?

350
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,140
What is all this?

351
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,600
Geum Jan Di.

352
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,040
This is our housewarming present.

353
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,850
What?

354
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,000
Ready.

355
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,200
The President has ordered that you should
grounded for the time being, Young Master.

356
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,120
It might be good to stay quiet for awhile.

357
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,960
How did that Witch find out?

358
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,300
I was being too careless.

359
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,420
I'm sorry.

360
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,480
Miss Jae Kyung has come.

361
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,080
- Why did she come?
- What do you mean why?

362
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,020
Is it weird for a fiancée
to come to her fiancé's house?

363
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,300
I'm not in the mood to play with you.

364
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,140
Just go home.

365
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,680
Oh, really?

366
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,420
I was going to ask if you wanted
to go Jan Di’s house with me.

367
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,190
But I guess not.

368
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,840
Then I'll just go alone.

369
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,270
What?

370
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,420
Where are you going?

371
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:33,890
Jan Di’s house.

372
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,040
Remember we ate ramen
together there last time.

373
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,410
I have to give this to her.

374
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,260
Well...

375
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,620
If you insist, I can go with you.

376
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,540
- Really?
- But...

377
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,080
You have tell the Witch about it.

378
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,320
Don't worry about that.

379
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,990
I already told her we're going on a date.

380
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,160
Let's go.

381
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,610
Ah, it's so annoying.

382
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,920
Come on, let's go.

383
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,620
- I really don't want to go.
- Come on, let's go.

384
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:12,210
Kang San.

385
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,000
Do you want more sausages?

386
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,070
He's sleeping.

387
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,360
San, if you sleep like that,
you're not going to grow tall.

388
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,310
San, hey!

389
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,990
<i>This feels great.</i>

390
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,510
<i>It's been a while since I felt like this.</i>

391
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,410
Doesn't it feel like we're at a MT?

392
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,290
Since it's a little boring,

393
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,630
You don't mean... we start
kissing or anything, right?

394
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:47,800
Although I'm all for that.

395
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,550
Do you want to play a game?

396
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,160
Game?

397
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,080
When you're staying up at a MT,
there's something that can't be left out.

398
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,730
What's that?

399
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,270
The truth or dare game.

400
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,180
Truth or dare game?

401
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,420
Me too! Me too!

402
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,520
In order, you ask a question to the person

403
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,730
you want to know something about.

404
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,030
How do you know if it's a truth or a lie?

405
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,490
You can't lie.

406
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,910
Instead, you can have a "not talk".

407
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,780
A "not talk".

408
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,910
If you don't want to
answer to that question,

409
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,460
As a punishment to that person
who asked the question...

410
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,920
You have to kiss them.

411
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,030
Why are you even doing that?

412
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,240
What? It's fun.

413
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,410
All right, since we're doing it,
how about French-kissing?

414
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,930
No way!

415
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:53,400
Then, a peck on the forehead?

416
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,680
<i>That's pretty decent, right?</i>

417
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,480
Unless...

418
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,550
Do you want to hit?

419
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,410
That sounds good too.

420
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,320
Let's just kiss.

421
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,000
Is it me?

422
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,890
Yoon Ji Hoo.

423
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:37,380
Besides Seo Hyun,
can you love another person?

424
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,450
I suddenly want to do it now.

425
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,330
Do what?

426
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,740
Hey! That's not a hard question.

427
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:01,760
Don't come.

428
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,530
Go away.

429
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,490
Is it my turn?

430
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,250
Yeah.

431
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,940
Jun Pyo.

432
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,670
If the person you love is having
a hard time because of you,

433
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,940
would you let her go?

434
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,880
No.

435
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,930
<i>I won't let her go.</i>

436
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,990
I can't let her go.

437
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,440
I'm going to hold on to her tightly...

438
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,080
and make her happy.

439
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,080
It's my turn now.

440
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,160
Geum Jan Di.

441
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,430
The promise we made on the street...

442
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,420
Is it still intact?

443
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:31,410
Even if something happens...

444
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,740
You can't run away from me.

445
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,260
I promise.

446
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:43,780
I promise that your mother won't
be the reason for it at least.

447
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,650
No.

448
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,430
The person who made that promise...

449
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,630
and the person who heard that promise..

450
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,150
don't exist anymore.

451
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,770
It's me now?

452
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,650
Woo Bin sunbae.

453
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:25,590
Me?

454
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,980
If F4 were girls,

455
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,430
who would you marry?

456
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,790
What?

457
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,150
I'm really curious.

458
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:41,510
Who would it be?

459
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,130
No way. I wouldn't have any.

460
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,720
I wouldn't allow it.

461
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,270
Obnoxious, strange, and
a cold-blooded Casanova.

462
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,450
You want me to live the rest
of my life with these people?

463
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,190
I'd rather just go live at a monastery.

464
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,900
What did you say?

465
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,110
Obnoxious?

466
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,270
Strange?

467
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,490
A cold-blooded Casanova?

468
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,540
I mean...

469
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,680
I can't help it.
How else would I describe you guys?

470
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,800
Go away!

471
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,620
Everything's good, right?

472
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,850
I'll be going.

473
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:46,990
Wait.

474
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,810
What now?

475
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,760
I want to do it too.

476
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,640
Do what?

477
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,030
The truth or dare game.

478
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:02,010
I just want to ask you one thing,
will you answer me?

479
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,950
The game's been over for awhile now.

480
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,720
<i>Love and friendship.</i>

481
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:15,080
Between the two, which one would you choose?

482
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,770
Both.

483
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,000
There's no such thing as
giving up in my dictionary.

484
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,010
Go and sleep.

485
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,490
Stupid.

486
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:50,010
If you keep choosing things that I like,

487
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,500
What do you expect me to do?

488
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,650
Noona.

489
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,320
The ground is shaking.

490
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,850
I'm shaking too.

491
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,770
Is it an earthquake?

492
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:29,780
You think this is Japan?

493
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,280
Earthquake?

494
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,010
Good, you were home.

495
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:04,530
Hurry and start packing.

496
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:07,300
<i>We're demolishing this building.</i>

497
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,020
Demolishing?

498
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,170
All of the sudden?

499
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,490
We don't know all the details
and we're only following orders.

500
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,240
So hurry and pack up.

501
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:19,370
<i>We were ordered to demolish
this place by today.</i>

502
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,000
By who?

503
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,260
How should we know?

504
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,600
Just hurry and pack.

505
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,400
After you called a man with a
fiancée to live next to you,

506
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,590
What?

507
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,630
You're not doing anything wrong?

508
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,890
Noona.

509
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,310
What are we going to do now?

510
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,080
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

511
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,890
This lady seems like your type.

512
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:21,760
Would you like to borrow her?

513
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,780
Yi Jung sunbae.

514
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,770
<i>Good job today.</i>

515
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,110
- Good job.
- See you again.

516
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,400
You're working hard.

517
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,010
I want to make something worthy quickly.

518
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:12,540
Then, I'll be going first.

519
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,300
- See you.
- Yes.

520
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,660
<i>What's that?</i>

521
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,780
It's so unique.

522
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,300
I made it when I was little.

523
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,630
Wow, it even has letters on it.

524
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,140
It's pretty.

525
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,750
Do you like it?

526
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:32,810
Yes.

527
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,910
Teacher, can you let me borrow
this for a couple of days?

528
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,840
I wanted to make something like this before.

529
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,230
Since that's not too hard,
do you want to try making it?

530
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:46,140
But it's really special to me,
so you return it to me safely.

531
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,120
Yes.

532
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,850
It's pretty.

533
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:00,160
- Then I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes, see you.

534
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,630
There's too much strength in your wrists.

535
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,870
Yi Jung sunbae.

536
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,080
Noona, you're jealous huh?

537
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:55,480
From tomorrow on, I'll be eating
a lot of fresh sushi, squids and clams.

538
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,480
That's so unfair.

539
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:01,540
You get to eat lots of good food
and sleep with Mom and Dad.

540
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:03,450
You're so lucky.

541
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,970
Should I just go too?

542
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,800
No way.

543
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:10,620
You said you were going to graduate
Shinhwa High and go to Shinhwa Med School.

544
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,350
What are you thinking trying to follow?

545
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,220
Are you sure you'll be all right?

546
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,530
Don't worry.

547
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,260
I'll take good care of Mom and Dad.

548
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,590
I'll be going.

549
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,020
Noona.

550
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,900
Don't just drink milk in
the mornings and eat rice.

551
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,940
What?

552
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,580
Rice!

553
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,650
Jun Pyo hyung still seems to like you!

554
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,520
I think he still likes you!

555
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:08,660
I'm always on your side.

556
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:10,970
Be strong! Fighting!

564
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:00,670
Geum Jan Di!

565
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,320
I'm sorry Noona.
I can't carry you.

566
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:07,760
Geum Jan Di!

567
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:10,600
I'm sorry. When I say Geum Jan Di,
I get all weak-hearted.

568
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,020
I'm going to go crazy.

569
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:16,060
Sorry, but we have to go quickly.

570
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,900
Do what?

571
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,240
I was going to eat it...

572
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,900
Can't I just eat it?
