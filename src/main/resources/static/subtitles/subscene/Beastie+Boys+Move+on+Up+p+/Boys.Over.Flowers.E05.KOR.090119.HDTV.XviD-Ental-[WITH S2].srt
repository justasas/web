Is that all you got?

4
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:25,867
Come on!

5
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:27,049
Bring it on!

6
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:28,369
Throw them!

7
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:47,140
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

8
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:48,913
<i>Help me.</i>

9
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:28,858
<i>There isn't anyone.</i>

10
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:30,927
<i>There won't be anyone else to help me.</i>

11
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:33,765
<i>If only there was just one
person who could give me a hand.</i>

12
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:41,448
Screw off!

<i>Gu Jun Pyo.</i>

14
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:12,985
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,312
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,445
It wasn't me.

17
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:39,908
It really wasn't me.

18
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:43,455
I don't care. Don't talk right now.

19
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:45,888
You still don't believe me, do you?

20
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:48,529
I do. I believe you.

21
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:08,140
I'll do it.

22
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,494
Do you want to sit still
or do you want me to tie you up?

23
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:14,922
Are you addicted or are you just clueless?

24
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:18,016
You've gone through so much
crap and you still haven't learned?

25
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:22,622
In a situation like that, obviously
the best of 38 strategies is to just walk out.

26
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:25,400
Your brain is really useless.

27
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:28,257
Your IQ isn't even 10, is it?

28
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,528
Your ability to learn is barely that of an orangutan.

29
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:32,769
An orangutan?

30
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,292
Isn't that right?
Look at this!

31
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:38,405
It's all because your brain's useless
that your body had to go through so much crap.

32
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:42,306
It's not the 38 strategies,
it's the 36 strategies!

33
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:43,638
Clueless rascal.

34
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,771
I don't want to get scolded by a person like you.

35
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,126
Close your eyes.

36
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,300
Ahh, that hurts!

37
00:04:10,277 --> 00:04:12,051
Wipe it yourself!

38
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:13,863
You rascal, really!

A bug, a bug!

43
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,712
Go away!

44
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,091
Go away!

45
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:14,490
Go away!

46
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:16,302
Go away!

47
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:18,568
Go away, go away!

48
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:21,130
Go away, go away!

49
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,852
Go away!

50
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:26,340
It's okay now.

51
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:37,624
<i>[Jun Pyo, Min Ji]</i>

52
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:47,727
What are you doing? Don't be like this.

53
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:55,246
You're so ugly, and you still want to be my bride?

54
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:58,990
Do you not want to go to daycare anymore?

55
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:03,029
Don't. Don't be like this.

56
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,295
Don't be like this.

57
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:07,185
You look like a pumpkin.

58
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:09,786
It'd be impossible with someone like you.

59
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:11,145
Disappear!

60
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,707
Go home, you ugly pumpkin!

61
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:16,546
No, don't be like this.

62
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:22,930
Don't be like this. Don't be like this.

63
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:29,607
Don't be like this. Don't be like this.

64
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,410
How I lived after that...

65
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,696
You guys will never know.

66
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,850
I was terrified to step out of the house

67
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:46,673
Because of the deep fear in my heart.

68
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:50,302
It was painful,
and yet I was too ashamed to face people.

69
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:56,292
After three years of being in pain,
I went to Germany.

70
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:59,542
Plastic surgery once every two years,

71
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:04,744
That taste of pain is even worse than death.

72
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:09,864
Do you know how I got through those years?

73
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,564
Yup, it was that expression.

74
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:22,217
Where you guys treated me like a bug,

75
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:26,179
The expression with which you guys
laughed at me, as if I were a freak.

76
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:32,402
I haven't forgotten it for a second.

77
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:37,079
Even though I don't remember,
I'm still very sorry.

78
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:38,321
No!

79
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:42,518
It's not that!

80
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:48,436
"Sorry" isn't what I want to hear from you!

81
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:49,441
Hey.

82
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:51,135
Calm down.

83
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:56,497
Look at me.

84
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,275
Aren't I beautiful?

85
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,485
I've become so beautiful.

86
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:12,859
Don't you like me?

87
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:18,421
Who did I come back for?

88
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:24,096
This is the moment I've
been waiting for for years!

89
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,178
Say it!

90
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,281
Say you like Oh Min Ji!

91
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:33,897
I'm begging you.

92
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:37,423
Say you like Oh Min Ji.

93
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,615
Hurry and say that you like Oh Min Ji!

94
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:42,408
How pathetic.

95
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:46,664
I can't watch anymore.

96
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:49,739
You know why?

97
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,921
It doesn't matter if it
was the past or the present.

98
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,323
You're still just a freak.

99
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,254
No, you've become worse than before.

100
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,742
At least, the girl back then,

101
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:09,264
Her heart and soul were beautiful.

102
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:54,481
Why are you here again?

103
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:56,005
What do you want now?

104
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,976
Of course I came for a reason.

105
00:10:58,096 --> 00:11:00,419
Reason? What reason?

106
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,316
I don't want to hear.

107
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:14,222
What are you doing?

108
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:19,650
Always randomly just...

109
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:22,349
Dragging people into your house.

110
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:24,477
You mean to say that with
your torn-up arms and legs,

111
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,846
And your wounds just treated with medicine,
I should still take you home?

112
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:30,841
Your parents would be absolutely thrilled.

113
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,222
I've already told someone to
call them and tell them not to worry.

114
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:42,016
And also.. your clothing and
backpack have already been thrown away.

115
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,321
There's no use in searching for them.

116
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:46,761
Thrown away?

117
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:49,321
You threw them all away?

118
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:51,232
We could've just tidied them up and washed them.

119
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,769
Without my permission,
how could you throw them away?

120
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,858
How could you still wear something like that?

121
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:56,160
Why wouldn't I be able to?

122
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,524
Don't forget,
I'm the daughter of a dry-cleaning family!

123
00:11:58,644 --> 00:11:59,963
So noisy!

124
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,525
How can a tiny and skinny
rascal have such a loud voice?

125
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:04,140
Did you eat a train's heart?

126
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:07,214
What?

127
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:09,401
It's not a heart! It's a train's smokestack!

128
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,219
How could that be?

129
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,747
Hey, look at it from a logical perspective.

130
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,328
How can a person eat a train's smokestack?

131
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:20,146
If he's going to eat anything,
of course it's going to be a heart.

132
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,556
What are you doing?

133
00:12:29,676 --> 00:12:31,233
Stay away from me!

134
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,853
Come over here.

135
00:12:57,487 --> 00:12:58,926
Let me see.

136
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:19,268
<i>Whenever I'm tired, lucky in my life,</i>

137
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:25,298
<i>You come by my side like a dream.</i>

138
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:30,957
<i>Whenever I'm sad, lucky in my dream.</i>

139
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:38,189
<i>You always warmly surround me.</i>

140
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:45,408
<i>I always smile like this.</i>

141
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:48,949
<i>No matter how many trials there are in this world,</i>

142
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:56,557
<i>I'll definitely never let you see my tears.</i>

143
00:13:56,677 --> 00:14:02,487
<i>Even if you don't understand my heart.</i>

144
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,935
<i>Even if you're far away,</i>

145
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:15,234
<i>I'll still be happy because of your smile.</i>

146
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:23,495
<i>Just take a step closer to me.</i>

147
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:29,135
That hurts so bad.

148
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:45,491
Your school uniform, shoes, and other accessories

149
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:48,112
Have been prepared during the night for you.

150
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,196
It's just that...

151
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,989
That...?

152
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:56,127
There's only one thing
that we need to apologize for.

153
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:20,966
But this one is a bit different from mine.

154
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:42,761
My bike wasn't this expensive!

155
00:15:42,881 --> 00:15:49,342
Mine was one of those average,
extremely, extremely, extremely average bicycles.

156
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,686
I'm very sorry, Miss.

157
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:59,255
The young master gave orders to buy Miss
things that were exactly the same as the old ones.

158
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,905
But that bike,
it was impossible for us to find that same model.

159
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:07,009
We've already tried our best.

160
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:12,743
Can you not find it in your
benevolent heart to accept these gifts?

161
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,604
But...that's still...this price.

162
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:32,044
This is what the chef prepared especially for you.

163
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:34,764
Kobe as well as barbecued beef

164
00:16:34,884 --> 00:16:38,282
In a Piemonte Alba truffle omelette.

165
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,843
Alba tru...

166
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:42,420
Truffle.

167
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,981
A truffle.

168
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,050
But, why haven't I seen Gu Jun Pyo?

169
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,360
The young master left early this morning.

170
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,193
Where'd he go?

171
00:16:57,482 --> 00:16:58,704
Noona?

172
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:14,044
<i>[Gu Jun Pyo]</i>

173
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,827
Has Jan Di come back?

174
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,980
Gu... Gu... Gu...

175
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,856
What's wrong?
I asked you whether or not your sister came back.

176
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:28,452
Shin... Shin...

177
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:31,112
Why are you stuttering?

178
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:34,600
Didn't Dad tell you that one day something bad would
happen because of these electromagnetic waves?

179
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,494
-F... F...
-What?

180
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,484
What is this?

181
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:41,757
Oh, whose son is this? He looks so handsome.

182
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,156
He's here.

183
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:45,146
- What?
- F4!

184
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,525
What is that?

185
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:49,087
The heir of Shinhwa group, Gu Jun Pyo!

186
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,663
Shinhwa Group.

187
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,382
What?

188
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:55,456
You mean that person has
come to our house? Right now?

189
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:05,716
Wife!

190
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,041
It doesn't matter how loudly you scream.

191
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,465
There's only one piece of saury.

192
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:37,249
This...

193
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,342
Do you eat this as a food?

194
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:01,081
This...

195
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:03,308
What kind of bug is that?

196
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:06,922
It's not a bug... it's a seafood.

197
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:10,449
What kind of seafood is that tiny?

198
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:11,849
Uh... that... that...

199
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:14,805
The ones that are called anchovies are that small.

200
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:17,544
Ahh...it sounds like you haven't heard of them.

201
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:22,680
Uh, that's... just because we didn't know
what kind of foods the sons of rich families eat.

202
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,089
Uh... then just eat this first.

203
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:30,208
Oh, I know what this is.

204
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:32,158
It's that... sau...

205
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:37,084
Sau...

206
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,312
- Ry!

207
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,879
He knows what saury is!

208
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:46,051
How does he know that?
Oh yes, this...

209
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,380
That's not how you eat that.

210
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:09,415
Oh, where'd she get that done?

211
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,442
It looks so good!

212
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:14,519
Darling!

213
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,745
Go look at that.

214
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:31,375
Darling!

215
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:34,781
How could that Oh Min Ji do that to you?

216
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,776
Even backstabbing has its limits.

217
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,383
Whose fault was it that
you had to go through this pain?

218
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,157
Let me through.

219
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,519
That's so scary.

220
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:48,475
Vicious, that's too vicious.

221
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:51,026
They say that with that kind of plastic surgery,

222
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:52,681
After you get it done once,

223
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,770
It'll be because it was too painful,

224
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,292
That you couldn't possibly
go through it a second time.

225
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:59,854
If we all risked our lives
like that to get the surgery done,

226
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:02,432
Who wouldn't be just as beautiful as she is?

227
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:05,683
That's right.

228
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:08,048
Is that... the face of a human?

229
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:12,301
If I looked like that,
I would've committed suicide a long time ago.

230
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,578
Your eyes.

231
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:28,521
Your nose.

232
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:30,334
Your cheekbones.

233
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:34,202
You paid money for all of that, didn't you?

234
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:36,682
If there's something you want,

235
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:39,145
Don't you just buy it with your money?

236
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:42,081
Can't the same be done for beauty?

237
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,189
Hey!

238
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:47,561
Haven't you all gotten plastic surgery?

239
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,788
Then why are you still picking on Min Ji?

240
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:54,593
If it's okay for people who are already
beautiful to want to be more beautiful,

241
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,471
Why isn't it okay for
ugly people to want to do it?

242
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:00,682
She didn't just do it for no reason.

243
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:03,503
She paid a tremendously painful price.

244
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:05,020
So what about it?

245
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,458
So what?

246
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:12,332
Can anybody say that that's not Min Ji's?

247
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,992
If you can, step up.

248
00:22:15,112 --> 00:22:17,002
Step up and let me see!

249
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:43,464
I won't beg you for forgiveness.

250
00:22:56,382 --> 00:23:00,381
Nor can I apologize.

251
00:23:06,204 --> 00:23:08,844
Don't think that I can forgive you.

252
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:30,557
Jan Di.

253
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:10,219
<i>Jan Di.</i>

254
00:24:11,756 --> 00:24:13,313
<i>Thank you.</i>

255
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:16,997
<i>We'll see each other again later.</i>

256
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:29,229
<i>From the places where I used
to sit and play with Geum Jan Di,</i>

257
00:24:29,982 --> 00:24:35,377
<i>You can hear the sound of washing clothes.</i>

258
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:42,120
<i>Talking about my love, Jan Di.</i>

259
00:25:15,444 --> 00:25:17,336
Everybody listen up!

260
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,218
In the name of Shinhwa High School's F4,

261
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:24,805
There is something that I want
to clearly announce to all of you.

262
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:27,935
From today on, second-year Geum Jan Di of Class B

263
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:30,634
Has become my, Gu Jun Pyo's, girlfriend.

264
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:32,644
I'm formally announcing this here.

265
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,521
Ahh, congratulations!

266
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:37,738
Ginger! Ginger!

267
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,397
No! No!

268
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:45,885
What is this?

269
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:48,316
Silence!

270
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:51,629
So from now on,

271
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:54,722
Geum Jan Di's words and actions will be,

272
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:59,633
The same as those of Gu Jun Pyo, me.

273
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:03,436
Nobody had better get fresh with her.
Understand?

274
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:04,736
Yes.

275
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:05,623
Understand?

276
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:06,746
Yes!

277
00:26:07,948 --> 00:26:09,583
I object!

278
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,318
- Ji Hoo!
- Ji Hoo!

279
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:23,623
I'm back.

280
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,847
But isn't it too soon for
that prince to be coming back?

281
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:41,513
Then for him to come back so early means...

282
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,232
Did something happen over there?

283
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:46,537
Maybe.

284
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:48,409
If that's the case...

285
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,034
Can't you go into the bathroom
and scream in celebration?

286
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,004
No?

287
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:57,792
Ohh, now since that Gu guy
is still the leader, you can't.

288
00:26:57,912 --> 00:26:59,770
It's not like that.

289
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,120
Then why is your face so pale?

290
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,268
Oh, I don't know.

291
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:08,224
I don't know what to say.

292
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:10,034
In any case, they've gotten weird.

293
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:11,118
My feelings.

294
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,339
What feelings?

295
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:17,088
It's like something has changed.

296
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,807
That's because he's come
back after drinking Paris' water.

297
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,738
It's no surprise that he must've got hotter.

298
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:24,075
I already told you it's not like that!

299
00:27:28,508 --> 00:27:30,360
Oh, Geum Kang San.

300
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:32,193
What's wrong?

301
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:36,428
He says there's a family emergency.

302
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:40,704
Mom!

303
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:42,734
Dad!

304
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:45,073
San! Where are you?

305
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,201
Noona, right here.

306
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,176
Dad's over here too!

307
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:51,378
Jan Di!

308
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:54,018
Come over and take a look at all this.

309
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:55,436
What is all of this?

310
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:56,776
It was Hyungnim who sent it over.

311
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:57,821
Hyungnim!

312
00:27:58,983 --> 00:27:59,712
Hyungnim?

313
00:27:59,832 --> 00:28:01,111
Jun Pyo hyungnim!

314
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,278
Dining table, sofa, TV, and kimchi refrigerator.

315
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:04,657
He sent it all over!

316
00:28:04,777 --> 00:28:09,406
As for the beds, because our door was too small,
we had to send them back.

317
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,745
You know that kind.

318
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:13,839
I mean, those lacey princess beds with the canopies.

319
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,534
Ohh, it was such a shame!

320
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:19,790
We should've knocked down
the door to get that bed in here.

321
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,085
How can you just accept everything he sends over?

322
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:26,164
But, Jan Di...
Dad wanted to send it back too, but...

323
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:27,898
What did the delivery man do wrong?

324
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:30,341
We had to accept these,
so that those people could go back.

325
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:31,719
Why should we send them back?

326
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,041
This isn't just for our family.

327
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:38,457
This is also for the reputation of their family.

328
00:28:38,577 --> 00:28:44,429
If we're too poor,
that'll cause Young Master Jun Pyo to lose face.

329
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,656
What do you know, you dumb girl?

330
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:50,695
No, there's not even a way to get through...
how can we live like this?

331
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:54,142
Do you want to get stuck living in the cracks
between the couch and the refrigerator?

332
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:57,571
Okay, I know, I know.
Just rewrap all of these.

333
00:29:00,743 --> 00:29:02,277
And send it to the warehouse
of your uncle in the countryside.

334
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:04,425
When you get married, we'll use it as dowry.

335
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:06,297
Okay? Okay? Okay?

336
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:07,913
Dad!

337
00:29:08,603 --> 00:29:09,686
Okay, I know.

338
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:13,210
Even though it's a shame,
we'll just have to send these back.

339
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,536
Just go tell him nicely.

340
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:17,527
We appreciate the thought.

341
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,634
Don't even accept the thought.

342
00:29:21,171 --> 00:29:24,678
Noona, let's at least keep the TV, okay?

343
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,824
You little rascal, Geum Kang San!

344
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,026
Let's talk.

345
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,589
Oh.
You've come in person?

346
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:54,346
What kind of reason made
you run all the way over here?

347
00:29:54,466 --> 00:29:57,323
Do you not understand what I'm saying?
I told you to talk to me.

348
00:29:57,443 --> 00:29:58,584
Move.

349
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,712
You're not going to move?

350
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:04,298
Really!

351
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:11,683
What?

352
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:13,560
What's wrong with this?

353
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:19,074
I was about to get a high score,
fat chance for that now, thanks to you.

354
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,493
What the heck do you want?

355
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:22,424
I should be asking you what the heck you want!

356
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:26,369
Without getting permission,
how could you turn my house upside down?

357
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:28,007
Oh, that.

358
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,164
Is there anything that you're not happy with?

359
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:33,780
Tell me. I'll get you a new one.

360
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,746
Hey!

361
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,479
My family has beds too, and chairs.

362
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,607
Washing machine,
refrigerator, TV, we have all of them!

363
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,400
Isn't it great to replace them with new ones?

364
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,745
Why are you replacing them?
What the heck are you?

365
00:30:42,865 --> 00:30:43,928
What could I be?

366
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:45,761
Starting yesterday, I'm your boyfriend!

367
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,909
Are you like this whenever you have a girlfriend?

368
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,352
Buying clothing, cars, replacing furniture.

369
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:52,264
After a while do you change houses too?

370
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:56,169
Actually, I had wanted to change the house first.

371
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,514
Secretary Jung said that since
it's connected to the dry cleaning store,

372
00:30:58,634 --> 00:30:59,755
He told me to search again later.

373
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,666
What do you take a person for?

374
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:04,228
Am I Shim Chung,* being sold to you?

375
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:04,228
{\a6}[*Shim Chung was an ancient filial daughter]

376
00:31:04,348 --> 00:31:05,844
I told you.

377
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:09,218
You don't buy friends with money,
you earn them with your heart.

378
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:12,312
Though I don't know how
you treated girlfriends before,

379
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:14,302
I really hate stuff like this.

380
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:18,019
None.

381
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:24,167
My previous girlfriends
or whatever…there were none.

382
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:28,983
That...

383
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:34,697
Then I'll let you slide this time...
just be careful from now on!

384
00:31:34,817 --> 00:31:36,628
That crappy temper of yours.

385
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:39,237
Why is it that every time I
want to be good to you, you flip out?

386
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,818
Who asked you to be good to me?

387
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:46,051
Nice shot!

388
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,107
Find the right position and throw it.

389
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:52,161
But...do you lounge around like this every day?

390
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:54,940
What, are you worried?

391
00:31:56,778 --> 00:31:59,398
There's a party today, so this is a special case.

392
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,349
I usually don't let women in.

393
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,872
Flies? What flies?*

394
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:03,872
{\a6}[Note: Homophones with "party"]

395
00:32:25,738 --> 00:32:28,122
What's up with that rascal Ji Hoo?

396
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:32,147
Is he back after becoming a real man in Paris?

397
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:36,245
Seeing how he slept all day like a cat,
I thought he hadn't matured at all.

398
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:38,669
Now he's a bit more human.

399
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:41,792
It's been a long time since I've
been able to tolerate him like this.

400
00:32:51,474 --> 00:32:53,582
Jan Di, do you want to join our equestrians club?

401
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:56,360
Jan Di, can you be our captain?

402
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,331
Jan Di, today's my birthday party!
You have to come!

403
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:02,391
Jan Di! Jan Di! Jan Di! Jan Di!

404
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:03,632
Hold on!

405
00:33:04,624 --> 00:33:05,747
Look, over there!

406
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:17,534
This is even scarier than
when they were bullying me.

407
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:19,111
Why are they like this?

408
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:21,810
Nowadays you don't scream and shout anymore?

409
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:23,781
Sunbae!

410
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,978
Habits can be really scary.

411
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,933
This place is just the same as before.

412
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:37,041
But it's too quiet.
How strange.

413
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,268
It doesn't feel right.

414
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:51,300
When are you going back?

415
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:54,768
I'm not going back.

416
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:56,916
And you?

417
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:00,620
Are you really dating Jun Pyo?

418
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,661
Uh...that.

419
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:06,405
Looks like it's true.

420
00:34:07,686 --> 00:34:09,735
Uh…actually.

421
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:12,017
Did I come a bit too late?

422
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:13,606
Eh?

423
00:34:15,163 --> 00:34:17,822
I was hoping to ask you to go out with me.

424
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:19,102
What?

425
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,004
I'm kidding.

426
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,070
Then how about...

427
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,967
We date secretly behind Jun Pyo's back?

428
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:37,962
Sunbae...

429
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,808
It's still the same.

430
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:44,699
The Jandi Baht here.

431
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:44,699
{\a6}[Note: Jandi Baht means grass]

432
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,733
I've missed it.

433
00:35:41,376 --> 00:35:43,189
Would you look at that?

434
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,686
Picking up a 500 won coin
could make you that happy.

435
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,493
What are you doing here?

436
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:56,552
You threw such a fit complaining about
how you hated the furniture and electronics,

437
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:59,192
But with one coin,
you're grinning so big your lips can't even close.

438
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:01,419
That's because it's a lucky...

439
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,584
What?

440
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:06,303
Did you drop this?

441
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:09,890
As a reward for your efforts, I threw one to see.

442
00:36:10,382 --> 00:36:12,313
Pretty good results, no?

443
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:14,765
Take it.

444
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:16,992
You keep it. Didn't you say it was lucky?

445
00:36:17,112 --> 00:36:21,366
From the moment I saw you,
my luck has gone bad.

446
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:22,568
No,

447
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,627
Your luck is good.

448
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:26,671
Extremely good.

449
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:27,499
What?

450
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:28,543
Let's go.

451
00:36:29,194 --> 00:36:30,139
Hey?

452
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:32,780
Can you not see that I'm here to work?

453
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,261
It's only for a bit.
If you get fired, I'll take the responsibility.

454
00:36:35,381 --> 00:36:38,315
Hey, can you not mention the
whole "taking responsibility" concept?

455
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:41,468
I get goosebumps just thinking about it.

456
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:42,819
Ahh, you ramble so much.

457
00:36:42,939 --> 00:36:43,764
Seriously.

458
00:36:43,884 --> 00:36:45,679
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

459
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:47,385
Hurry up and get in the car!

460
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:55,088
Oh, Jan Di.

461
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,173
Ga Eul...

462
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:00,321
What's going on with Jan Di?

463
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:05,886
Throw them all out.

464
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:08,546
Young Master.
Doing this without prior notice is a bit...

465
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,989
If you have to get permission and beg for understanding
in everything, what kind of leader are you?

466
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,604
Cut the crap. Clear out the place.

467
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:14,023
They'll close before 6pm.

468
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:15,343
Please wait three hours.

469
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:17,659
Are you asking me to wait three hours?

470
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,211
I'll make other arrangements.

471
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:21,871
Forget it. I'll take care of it myself.

472
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:25,201
Where is it?

473
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:28,472
What?
Are you talking about... that?

474
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:31,469
But that is...

475
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:32,769
Do you not even know what that is?

476
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:34,976
Please wait just a moment, sir.

477
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:40,075
Fire her immediately.

478
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:52,804
Sir, sir!

479
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,873
Fire, fire!

480
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:15,433
Fire! Fire!

481
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:30,294
<i>Stand by me,</i>

482
00:38:30,414 --> 00:38:32,439
<i>Look towards me.</i>

483
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,754
<i>Even though I don't understand love yet</i>

484
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:38,902
<i>Stand by me.</i>

485
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:40,812
<i>{\a6}Watch over me.</i>

486
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,497
I'm not wearing this!

487
00:38:40,911 --> 00:38:42,152
Let's go.

488
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,871
<i>{\a6}Even though I'm not good with love.</i>

489
00:38:45,226 --> 00:38:47,332
<i>Together make it love.</i>

490
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,815
<i>Forever making you smile.</i>

491
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:53,756
<i>Filled with your happy smiles.</i>

492
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,945
<i>Together make it love,</i>

493
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:58,252
<i>Forever making you smile.</i>

494
00:38:58,372 --> 00:39:02,173
<i>Hold on now, hold on to my hand.</i>

495
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:04,849
<i>Stand by me.</i>

496
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,056
<i>Look towards me.</i>

497
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:10,839
<i>Even though I don't understand love yet.</i>

498
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:13,507
<i>Stand by me,</i>

499
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:15,558
<i>Watch over me.</i>

500
00:39:15,678 --> 00:39:19,901
<i>{\a6}Even though I'm not good with love.</i>

501
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,226
Let's go.

502
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:24,567
Did you really have to take it that far?

503
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:30,321
I'm already on my way.
You have to keep your promise.

504
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,323
Tang dynasty ceramic design, white porcelain.

505
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:39,053
From now on don't give me any
more crap about wanting to go back.

506
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,519
Mmhmm.

507
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,160
Turn around.

508
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:52,721
Why isn't she here yet?

509
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,130
Ga Eul.

510
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:01,337
You're not allowed to leave
me behind and run off too.

511
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:03,426
Where could I possibly go?

512
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:04,864
Jan Di's not here either.

513
00:40:04,984 --> 00:40:06,657
You really won't leave, right?

514
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:16,827
Welcome.

515
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:18,975
Do you need something?

516
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:21,422
I'm not Jan Di. I'm Jan Di's friend Ga Eul.

517
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:23,196
Hurry. It's an emergency.

518
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:25,265
What's wrong?

519
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:28,496
Did something happen to Jan Di?

520
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:30,368
What happened?

521
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:34,472
Was there an accident?

522
00:40:34,592 --> 00:40:37,663
If we're late,
you might not be able to see her again. Hurry!

523
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:39,122
Oh, what should we do?

524
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:43,043
Parents.
We have to contact her parents.

525
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:45,734
They've already been told.

526
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:55,639
What are we going to do? Jan Di.

527
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:58,497
Let's go.

528
00:41:16,126 --> 00:41:17,446
Jan Di!

529
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:22,648
What's going on?

530
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:25,012
We're going on a trip.

531
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:26,350
A trip?

532
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,513
Mmhmm.

533
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:28,892
How can I do that?

534
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:30,764
I haven't even talked it over with my parents yet.

535
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:32,518
I told them already.

536
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:34,744
What?

537
00:41:35,547 --> 00:41:37,695
I've already gotten their permission.

538
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:41,951
I was worried you'd feel awkward if you
went by yourself, so I brought your friend too.

539
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:43,508
Are we good now?

540
00:41:46,803 --> 00:41:48,379
This is ridiculous.

541
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,650
Come on, let's go!

542
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:55,591
<i>Almost paradise,</i>

543
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,286
<i>More brilliant than dawn.</i>

544
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:03,030
<i>Your love for me,</i>

545
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,769
<i>Is like being on top of the world.</i>

546
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:07,346
We switched planes?

547
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:10,655
I heard there was a one-year waitlist for planes
like this because there were so many reservations.

548
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:13,079
Shinhwa really is different.

549
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,478
Ladies and gentlemen.

550
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:19,552
Welcome aboard our Air Shinhwa
Flight 001 from Seoul to New Caledonia.

551
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:24,811
New Caledonia time is two hours faster than Seoul
and it's 3 ‘o'clock in the afternoon over there.

552
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:27,426
Local temperature is 27 degrees Celsius.

553
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:29,476
- Caledonia?
- Caledonia?

554
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:35,407
Are you so surprised that you
don't know how to breathe anymore?

555
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:37,653
Do you need an oxygen mask?

556
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:39,584
Gu Jun Pyo.

557
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:42,194
Is my relationship with you
one where we can go traveling together?

558
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:44,420
Even if it is a relationship
where we can travel together,

559
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,588
Shouldn't you ask me for my opinion?

560
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:48,617
You should've at least
confirmed the schedule with me.

561
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:51,593
Did your Shinhwa preschool
not teach you this common sense?

562
00:42:51,713 --> 00:42:54,828
I wanted to go somewhere nice with you.
All the preparations have been made.

563
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:57,351
Just because you're gone doesn't
mean chaos will erupt in South Korea.

564
00:42:57,471 --> 00:42:58,631
What's the problem?

565
00:42:58,751 --> 00:43:00,543
I don't know about South Korea.

566
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:03,025
But our congee shop might have some problems.

567
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,911
If they find out that both of us are gone...

568
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,177
No.
Let's go.

569
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:26,735
Would you take a seat please?

570
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:30,868
<i>In my life.</i>

571
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:34,415
<i>It's like a dream in my weary life.</i>

572
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:41,704
<i>If I can forever be in love
with the image of you walking toward me.</i>

573
00:43:41,824 --> 00:43:45,645
<i>Filled with your angelic smile,</i>

574
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:49,349
<i>Our paradise.</i>

575
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:54,688
<i>I'll use flowers that are only for you,
And fill it forever.</i>

576
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:57,682
Seafood congee is ready!

577
00:43:58,864 --> 00:43:59,888
Here, here!

578
00:44:00,008 --> 00:44:01,583
Our congee.

579
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:03,987
Over here, let's get some food!

580
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,482
Waitress!

581
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:07,569
Aldebaran.

582
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,446
Epsilon Eridani.

583
00:44:11,254 --> 00:44:13,382
Beauty like that
shouldn't exist on this earth.

584
00:44:13,502 --> 00:44:14,917
Long live F4!

585
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,439
Manager.

586
00:44:17,793 --> 00:44:20,473
- Four abalone congee specials.
- Abalone congee...four?

587
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:22,116
Okay!

588
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,337
Waitress!

589
00:44:46,716 --> 00:44:50,854
This is your captain speaking.
We will be arriving to Maré Island shortly.

590
00:44:50,974 --> 00:44:54,465
We wish you a pleasant trip to New Caledonia,
French paradise.

591
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:00,849
We're here.

592
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:02,288
Wake up!

593
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,688
<i>Stand by me,</i>

594
00:45:31,808 --> 00:45:33,790
<i>Look towards me.</i>

595
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:38,144
<i>Even though I don't understand love yet.</i>

596
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:40,410
<i>Stand by me.</i>

597
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,617
<i>Watch over me.</i>

598
00:45:42,737 --> 00:45:46,822
<i>Even though I'm not good with love.</i>

599
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:10,723
<i>The more I look at you, the happier I am.</i>

600
00:46:10,843 --> 00:46:14,782
<i>Absentmindedly, I'll start humming.</i>

601
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:19,068
<i>Suddenly I want to buy a rose.</i>

602
00:46:19,188 --> 00:46:23,148
<i>I think that this me is rather new.</i>

603
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:28,045
<i>My thoughts are all on you.</i>

604
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:32,360
<i>The world has become beautiful.</i>

605
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,735
<i>If you can feel this too.</i>

606
00:46:36,855 --> 00:46:41,724
<i>Please wait for me.</i>

607
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:45,014
<i>Together make it love.</i>

608
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:47,438
<i>Forever making you smile.</i>

609
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:51,454
<i>Filled with your happy smiles.</i>

610
00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:53,680
<i>Together make it love,</i>

611
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,183
<i>Forever make it your smile.</i>

612
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:59,978
<i>Hold on now, hold on to my hand.</i>

613
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:02,677
<i>Stand by me.</i>

614
00:47:02,797 --> 00:47:04,766
<i>Look towards me.</i>

615
00:47:04,886 --> 00:47:09,317
<i>Even though I don't understand love yet.</i>

616
00:47:09,437 --> 00:47:11,273
<i>Stand by me,</i>

617
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:13,419
<i>Watch over me.</i>

618
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:17,706
<i>Even though I'm not good with love.</i>

619
00:47:17,826 --> 00:47:26,329
<i>The better I understand your heart,
the more excited I get.</i>

620
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:30,722
<i>All I do is smile.
I want to quietly kiss you just once.</i>

621
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:35,274
<i>That way, will I get closer to you?</i>

622
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:39,203
<i>Is this feeling of mine love?</i>

623
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:43,518
<i>Right now I'm still rather shy.</i>

624
00:47:43,638 --> 00:47:48,049
<i>Right now it's still impossible
for me to completely express how I feel.</i>

625
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:53,626
<i>Please wait for my love.</i>

626
00:47:54,419 --> 00:47:56,410
<i>Together make it love.</i>

627
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,853
<i>Forever making you smile.</i>

628
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:02,853
<i>Filled with your happy smiles.</i>

629
00:48:02,973 --> 00:48:04,998
<i>Together make it love,</i>

630
00:48:05,118 --> 00:48:07,461
<i>Forever make it your smile.</i>

631
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:11,618
<i>Hold on now, hold on to my hand.</i>

632
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:16,168
<i>Stand by me.
Watch over me.</i>

633
00:48:16,288 --> 00:48:20,798
<i>It seems like I'm still not very good with love.</i>

634
00:48:23,158 --> 00:48:25,306
It feel like its floating on the ocean.

635
00:48:27,118 --> 00:48:28,852
It is floating.

636
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,133
Really?

637
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,219
Come with me.

638
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,066
Huh?

639
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:51,925
How can this be?

640
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:57,386
It's hard to wrap my mind around.

641
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:58,864
Where are we again?

642
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:01,327
This is Maitre Island.

643
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:03,936
This belongs to our resort only. It's our island.

644
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:05,119
Our?

645
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:07,660
Mmhmm. It's Shinhwa group's.

646
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,419
Yi Jung bought an island too. It's in Dubai.

647
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:13,709
To be completely accurate, I bought a manmade
island which has the shape of Korea.

648
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:16,251
But those rascals missed Dok Do island.

649
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,891
So we're gonna make it ourselves.

650
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:22,982
Then, besides F4,

651
00:49:23,102 --> 00:49:27,042
This is everyone else's first time here.
Let's take a little tour of the island.

652
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:33,585
<i>Almost paradise.</i>

653
00:49:33,705 --> 00:49:37,151
<i>Even warmer than the sun.</i>

654
00:49:37,532 --> 00:49:41,092
<i>The gaze with which you look at me</i>

655
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:44,330
<i>Is like being on top of the world</i>

656
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,833
<i>In my life.</i>

657
00:49:46,953 --> 00:49:50,522
<i>It's just like sunlight in my weary life.</i>

658
00:49:50,642 --> 00:49:55,772
<i>As long as I can have
the love you give me forever.</i>

659
00:49:55,892 --> 00:50:00,060
<i>If you can love me forever.</i>

660
00:50:01,656 --> 00:50:07,882
<i>Grab your hand and shout to the world,</i>

661
00:50:08,826 --> 00:50:10,796
<i>Swear by the sky,</i>

662
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:16,138
<i>That I will only love you forever.</i>

663
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:18,500
<i>Like the starlight in the night sky.</i>

664
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,452
<i>A beautiful dream that only belongs to us.</i>

665
00:50:22,572 --> 00:50:24,107
<i>Let's go to paradise.</i>

666
00:50:24,227 --> 00:50:25,899
<i>I only want to be with you.</i>

667
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:30,871
<i>I can go anywhere, to my paradise.</i>

668
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:33,603
<i>The days when I lost you,</i>

669
00:50:33,723 --> 00:50:38,155
<i>Forget about all that pain,</i>

670
00:50:38,275 --> 00:50:44,814
<i>Right now is the beginning. Being with you.</i>

671
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,908
<i>Let's start traveling.</i>

672
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:48,780
<i>Let's start running.</i>

673
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,795
<i>Loving you forever.</i>

674
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:55,637
<i>Almost paradise.</i>

675
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:59,370
<i>Even warmer than the sun.</i>

676
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:03,232
<i>The gaze with which you look at me,</i>

677
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:06,193
<i>Is like being on top of the world,</i>

678
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,675
<i>In my life.</i>

679
00:51:08,795 --> 00:51:12,478
<i>It's just like sunlight in my weary life.</i>

680
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:21,113
<i>As long as I can have
the love you give me forever.</i>

681
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:25,094
<i>You are all of my love.</i>

682
00:51:25,214 --> 00:51:28,968
<i>You are all of my life.</i>

683
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:35,714
<i>I will love you with my everything.</i>

684
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,789
Give it to the one you love.

685
00:52:26,267 --> 00:52:27,232
What?

686
00:52:31,586 --> 00:52:33,615
Love. Love?

687
00:52:46,134 --> 00:52:47,868
They look like Koreans.

688
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,015
Excuse me.

689
00:52:50,135 --> 00:52:50,725
Yes?

690
00:52:50,845 --> 00:52:51,619
What is that?

691
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,535
Oh, that's a native woman. I think they
say she's a very accurate fortune teller.

692
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,545
She's really accurate.

693
00:52:56,665 --> 00:52:58,240
- She tells fortunes?
- Yes.

694
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,215
Fortunetelling?

695
00:53:01,335 --> 00:53:03,111
Oh, oh, okay,

696
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,984
I see a man.

697
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,123
Man?

698
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:39,178
Your future husband.

699
00:53:39,298 --> 00:53:40,990
Husband.

700
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,296
Husband, husband.

701
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,546
Where? Where?

702
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,044
Who is it?

703
00:53:47,164 --> 00:53:50,039
Here with you.

704
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:51,241
What?

705
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,053
And soulmate.

706
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:55,280
Soulmate?

707
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,673
That's great!

708
00:53:56,793 --> 00:53:59,136
A soulmate turning into your husband.

709
00:53:59,256 --> 00:54:01,717
That's great, that's great!
That's like an added plus!

710
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:04,003
Two different men. Two!

711
00:54:05,663 --> 00:54:07,712
What does she mean now?

712
00:54:07,832 --> 00:54:12,343
That means...the soulmate and the future husband...

713
00:54:12,463 --> 00:54:14,254
Are two different guys?

714
00:54:14,374 --> 00:54:16,402
You're losing something important.

715
00:54:16,522 --> 00:54:17,880
Losing?

716
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,402
Important?

717
00:54:20,522 --> 00:54:22,511
As a woman!

718
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:26,826
As a woman...important.

719
00:54:28,229 --> 00:54:30,908
Could that mean...?

720
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:40,950
What's wrong?

721
00:54:45,226 --> 00:54:46,467
It was a dream.

722
00:54:47,272 --> 00:54:50,464
Ga Eul...I...I had...I had a dream.

723
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:52,631
What kind of dream?

724
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:55,075
It was a dream...a dream.

725
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:56,612
Thank goodness.

726
00:54:58,323 --> 00:55:01,160
You and I went to a fortune teller.

727
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,608
A lady who looked like this.
We went to her to have our fortunes told.

728
00:55:04,728 --> 00:55:06,815
But that lady told us...

729
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:08,855
We have to be careful.

730
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:10,984
You have to go somewhere with me.

731
00:55:11,595 --> 00:55:12,738
Where?

732
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:14,984
You'll know once we get there.

733
00:55:16,935 --> 00:55:19,358
- Hurry up and come with me.
- Hey, hey.

734
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,285
Ga Eul!

735
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:22,371
Ga Eul!

736
00:55:22,491 --> 00:55:23,593
Jan Di!

737
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,145
Jan Di!

738
00:55:28,488 --> 00:55:29,434
Please.

739
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:32,212
Ga Eul!

740
00:55:32,528 --> 00:55:33,414
Jan Di!

741
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,010
Take care!

742
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,572
It's not like she's going to a battlefield.

743
00:55:38,223 --> 00:55:40,489
Wow, it's so beautiful.

744
00:55:48,705 --> 00:55:51,306
Hey. Take a picture for me.

745
00:55:52,745 --> 00:55:55,346
You've done all of the typical tourist things.

746
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:06,137
Are we good now? Let's go.

747
00:56:06,257 --> 00:56:08,206
What a sec!

748
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:12,560
You've looked over there.
You've taken a picture. Aren't you done now?

749
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,077
How could I be done?

750
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:16,403
Let's go look from up there.

751
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,696
We have to go up there?

752
00:56:20,816 --> 00:56:24,105
Hey! This is already my ninth time here,

753
00:56:24,225 --> 00:56:26,804
But you're the first person to go up there.

754
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:32,674
Why am I stuck babysitting such a hillbilly?

755
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:37,837
Take it. White porcelain, white porcelain.

756
00:57:26,017 --> 00:57:28,913
Isn't it a good thing that you came up here?

757
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,164
You...

758
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,558
This is your punishment for lying about something
happening to Jan Di and for dragging us here.

759
00:57:35,678 --> 00:57:37,883
It wasn't completely a lie.

760
00:57:39,629 --> 00:57:43,176
Sooner or later something
will happen between the two of them.

761
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:44,791
No!

762
00:57:46,368 --> 00:57:48,358
What are you thinking about?

763
00:57:48,478 --> 00:57:50,900
Who says I'm thinking about anything?

764
00:57:52,285 --> 00:57:54,452
Let's go back down.

765
00:58:08,326 --> 00:58:09,469
What?

766
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:11,498
Why isn't there a single person here?

767
00:58:11,618 --> 00:58:12,449
Is this a deserted island?

768
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:14,439
Aren't the two of us here?

769
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:18,321
What is your purpose in intentionally
dragging me to this deserted island?

770
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:19,700
Purpose?

771
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:22,399
I don't have any of that. Only intention.

772
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:23,845
Gu Jun Pyo!

773
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,210
I'm warning you.

774
00:58:26,643 --> 00:58:29,658
If you're using this trip
as an excuse to mess around with me,

775
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:31,491
Don't even have such a dark heart.

776
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:32,811
Dark heart?

777
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:36,198
A person's heart isn't like pencil lead.

778
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:37,282
And also,

779
00:58:37,402 --> 00:58:40,986
With you always twisting things
around and being suspicious of everything,

780
00:58:41,106 --> 00:58:43,489
Can you say that you have a white heart?

781
00:58:44,124 --> 00:58:45,464
Come with me.

782
00:59:27,104 --> 00:59:29,370
How did you do this?

783
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,577
Didn't I say this before?

784
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:35,735
The things that you can't even imagine,
I can show you every day.

785
00:59:36,046 --> 00:59:37,997
Jan Di. You're so tough on the outside,

786
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:40,007
But little things like this can get to you?

787
00:59:40,127 --> 00:59:42,411
Is this a little thing?

788
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,357
It's like magic.

789
00:59:49,909 --> 00:59:51,820
Are you a genie?

790
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,239
Genie?

791
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:56,687
Who is that rascal?
Is that guy more handsome than me?

792
00:59:56,807 --> 00:59:59,521
No, the genie is the spirit in the lamp in Aladdin.

793
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:01,373
He can make anything happen.

794
01:00:01,493 --> 01:00:04,368
Ohh. I was wondering who you were talking about.

795
01:00:05,077 --> 01:00:07,954
But...can that guy really do anything?

796
01:00:08,074 --> 01:00:12,113
No. Even the genie in the
lamp has things that he can't do.

797
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:16,567
Like killing people, or saving dying people, and...

798
01:00:16,687 --> 01:00:18,182
And?

799
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:23,407
And making someone fall in love with someone else.

800
01:00:25,181 --> 01:00:27,033
He can't do that.

801
01:00:32,277 --> 01:00:35,706
How are there so many
things that a genie can't do?

802
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:38,996
Rascal. He sounds weaker than me.

803
01:00:40,242 --> 01:00:41,661
I can do it.

804
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:44,498
No matter if it's killing someone,
or saving someone.

805
01:00:44,618 --> 01:00:46,961
If I set my mind to it, I can do it all.

806
01:00:47,081 --> 01:00:48,163
So as long as you say the word.

807
01:00:48,283 --> 01:00:50,232
Of course you can do it.

808
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:53,336
Oh, right.
I almost forgot.

809
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:03,033
Hello, I'm Gu Jun Pyo.

810
01:01:03,153 --> 01:01:05,358
We're in New Caledonia.

811
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:06,737
Jan Di Baht...

812
01:01:07,151 --> 01:01:09,732
No...Geum Jan Di is here with me.

813
01:01:09,852 --> 01:01:11,562
I'll put her on.

814
01:01:16,213 --> 01:01:17,198
Mom!

815
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:21,644
Jan Di! Geum Jan Di! Are you doing well?

816
01:01:21,764 --> 01:01:23,890
You're doing very well, aren't you, Jan Di?

817
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,801
Aigoo, my daughter! Keep it up!

818
01:01:25,921 --> 01:01:28,195
Dad, I'm doing really well.

819
01:01:28,315 --> 01:01:29,771
Noona! Noona! Is it fun over there?

820
01:01:29,891 --> 01:01:32,057
Have you eaten a hairy crab? Hairy crab?

821
01:01:32,177 --> 01:01:33,751
Sorry, San.

822
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:36,648
I'm sorry that I'm the
only person who got to come here.

823
01:01:36,768 --> 01:01:38,697
No! No! Don't worry about us!

824
01:01:38,817 --> 01:01:41,140
Have a good time! Have a good time!

825
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:44,943
Hey, hey, hey! Jan Di.
You have to be nicer to Young Master Jun Pyo.

826
01:01:45,063 --> 01:01:48,272
This camera was sent over by his secretary.

827
01:01:48,392 --> 01:01:49,849
Go for it!

828
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:54,873
Noona! Noona! If you guys develop, I want to eat
10 hairy crabs, and then wrap one for Yong San.

829
01:01:54,993 --> 01:01:56,844
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

830
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,727
The Geum family's glory is in your hands, okay?

831
01:01:58,847 --> 01:01:59,918
Got it? Go for it!

832
01:02:00,038 --> 01:02:02,854
Aja! Aja!

833
01:02:23,979 --> 01:02:27,420
Did I do something wrong again?

834
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,444
I just...

835
01:02:28,564 --> 01:02:30,100
No, Gu Jun Pyo.

836
01:02:32,602 --> 01:02:33,765
Thank you.

837
01:02:35,764 --> 01:02:37,518
Then why are you crying?

838
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:41,538
Because this place is too wonderful.

839
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:47,407
I don't know when my parents would
be able to come to a place like this.

840
01:02:47,841 --> 01:02:51,959
If my family could see this,
they'd definitely be very happy.

841
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,816
Then we'll come together.

842
01:02:55,408 --> 01:02:56,393
What?

843
01:02:56,964 --> 01:03:00,728
Why don'we just come again with your family?

844
01:03:05,301 --> 01:03:08,749
Once you're done being touched,
we should get to the main course.

845
01:03:10,325 --> 01:03:11,902
Main course?

Dad! Dad!

853
01:03:42,646 --> 01:03:44,378
From now on, don't swim by yourself.

854
01:03:44,498 --> 01:03:46,033
And don't take walks by yourself.

855
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:47,393
You!

856
01:03:47,513 --> 01:03:49,285
Did you come to give me this?

857
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:52,220
If you're going to throw it away
like a cheap good, you're dead for sure!

858
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,766
Have you accepted my feelings?

859
01:03:55,886 --> 01:03:56,633
What?

860
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:58,466
Don't make me wait too long.

861
01:03:59,353 --> 01:04:03,166
Gu Jun Pyo. Starting today,
your name goes on the list of players.

862
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:06,122
Does all of this need to be eaten?

863
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:08,132
Where'd it go?

864
01:04:08,252 --> 01:04:09,156
What?

865
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:10,871
The thing I gave you.

866
01:04:10,991 --> 01:04:12,493
Oh, that...

867
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:13,951
How'd he leave?

868
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:15,331
He left this morning by plane.

869
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,996
Geum Jan Di…do you not have any feelings?

870
01:04:19,567 --> 01:04:23,316
I don't expect that apologizing
will make things okay.

871
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:27,513
You'd better remember this clearly.
