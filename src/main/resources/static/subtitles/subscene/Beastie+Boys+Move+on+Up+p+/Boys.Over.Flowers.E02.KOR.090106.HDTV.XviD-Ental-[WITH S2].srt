Episode 2

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,522
Who are you?

4
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:20,215
Let go!

5
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:23,039
- Shut up!
- Let go! Let go!

6
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:28,049
<i>Are you guys having a group training?</i>

7
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:30,960
What?

8
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:33,867
That...

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:46,335
You didn't forget anything in the
pancake recipe you gave me?

10
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,120
What?

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,655
I did as you instructed.

12
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:54,796
But it didn't rise.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,636
Did you add baking powder?

14
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:01,815
Yes.

15
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:03,184
That.

16
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:09,390
And they sell the pancake mix.

17
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:12,174
Let go.

18
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,511
Why are you guys still here?

19
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,849
That... Jun Pyo sunbae...

20
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:23,557
None of your business.

21
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:30,111
What are you doing? Let's go.

22
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,988
You're getting goose bumps.

23
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:04,487
Baking powder... Now I know.

24
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:07,845
Seems like I have to try again.

25
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:09,220
Sunbae.

26
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:15,230
Thank you for helping me.

27
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,410
I wasn't helping you.

28
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,397
I just couldn't stand seeing
these annoying acts.

29
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,160
What? Ji Hoo?

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,165
Yes, he had to appear right at that moment.

31
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:40,348
Who asked you to do these things?

32
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:43,347
Didn't you say to let Geum Jan Di suffer?

33
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,448
I just told you to scare her
so that she would admit her mistake!

34
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:48,749
- Who told you to do that?
- Sorry. It's our fault.

35
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,243
Do you guys want to leave school too?

36
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:54,027
Get lost! I don't want to see you!

37
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,716
Get lost!

38
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:02,099
Jan Di, are you really alright?

39
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:04,133
It's nothing big.

40
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,273
That's still nothing big?

41
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:07,825
Those F4.

42
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:09,614
I thought of cutting them some
slack because of their good looks.

43
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:11,499
I didn't think they were really so bad.

44
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:13,149
Birds of a feather flock together.

45
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,075
The four of them are always together right?

46
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,039
It's not really like that.

47
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,416
Why not?

48
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:23,598
One of them is a little different.

49
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:25,817
One person?

50
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:28,442
Who's that?

51
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,620
She's so pretty in this advertisement again.

52
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,603
Sunbae likes her too?

53
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,379
No matter what, touching the advertisement
like that would dirty your hands.

54
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:26,277
She's really pretty right?

55
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:30,186
She's just like a goddess who
descended to Earth.

56
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:31,296
Goddess?

57
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,065
Not only is her face pretty.

58
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:36,363
She's very smart too.

59
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:40,251
She donates almost all the
money she earned as a model.

60
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:44,120
Not long ago, she passed the
French International Lawyer exam.

61
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:48,403
You know this woman?

62
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:52,782
Of course! She's my idol.

63
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:54,943
Idol?

64
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:02,109
Although everyone thought that
she would take over her parents'

65
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,110
company after she graduated...

66
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:06,368
I didn't think so.

67
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:12,339
I've always thought that
she would do something even greater.

68
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:16,070
On every school holiday,
she would go to Africa, Afghanistan.

69
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,134
Oh, she went to Tibet not long ago too.

70
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:25,102
Though this is just my imagination,

71
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:30,438
I hope she marries someone of royalty
status or someone who may become president.

72
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:37,685
Like Diana or Audrey Hepburn to be a
princess who contributes to world peace.

73
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,042
Something like that.

74
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,890
She's just a model.

75
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,463
Why?

76
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:51,000
Didn't the French president
divorce his wife to be with a model?

77
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,437
Who would know?

78
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,796
Maybe the next French president
or some European prince,

79
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,488
would fall in love with Unni at first
sight and ask for her hand in marriage.

80
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:03,629
I think there's a high
possibility of this happening.

81
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:06,378
Don't you think so?

82
00:07:06,498 --> 00:07:09,815
Every time I see you,
I find you so noisy and irritating.

83
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:13,899
I just...

84
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:20,832
What would you know?

85
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:39,251
<i>Hey Kang San! Aren't you going to eat?</i>

86
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,882
You've been on the computer all day long!

87
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:44,141
Can the computer give you money or food?

88
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,056
<i>He just faces the electron
wave for the whole day.</i>

89
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:49,355
San, be careful! 
Or your family line will be cut*.

89
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:49,355
{\a6}<i>(*can't have a baby due to the electron wave)</i>

90
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,196
I can earn money and get food!

91
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:53,887
How dare you look down on the Cyber Arbeit King?

92
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,094
Cyber-what?

93
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,254
Cyber Arbeit*

93
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:57,254
{\a6}<i>(*Internet addicts who work online)</i>

94
00:07:57,374 --> 00:08:00,554
It may be the rich and
wealthy who supports the world,

95
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,151
but to make this world
more rich and exciting,

96
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:03,952
you'll need depend on a maniac like me.

97
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:07,560
You just keep staring at
the computer screen.

98
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,249
How dirty.

99
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,111
Hey! What is this?

100
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:14,350
Hm jom moo...?

101
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,588
Hey you...

102
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,805
I've lived for so long and it's the first time
I'm hearing about a worm-eaten (jom) radish (moo).

103
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:23,163
Honey, it doesn't mean that.

104
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:27,496
It means, "a radish which has a small (jom) scar (hm)"

105
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:29,128
Hm jom moo is...

106
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:32,553
"Hmm, if this is the truth,
then it would be a little scary."

107
00:08:32,673 --> 00:08:34,007
That's what it means!

108
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:34,969
What?

109
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,346
Noona! This would totally make headline news!

110
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,544
<i>Headline?</i>

111
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:42,076
It says that a female student
in your school is pregnant!

112
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:43,372
What?!

113
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,341
Where? Where?

114
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:50,855
Isn't it written here?

115
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:54,351
<i>Miss K, a second year student
in Shinhwa High School,</i>

116
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:57,684
<i>has been spotted going in
and out of the obstetrics hospital.</i>

117
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,432
Second year, Miss K.

118
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:02,392
Jan Di! Then there's a possibility
that she's in your class.

119
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:03,924
If it's Miss K, is her surname Kim?

120
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,044
It can be Kang.

121
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:06,905
Kwon. There's still Miss Kwon.

122
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:08,849
<i>The world is in a mess now.</i>

123
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:12,247
How can a second year student in high
school get pregnant? Oh my...

124
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,173
How can such a thing happen to a
prestigious school like Shinhwa High School?

125
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:18,761
Oh, my! What's wrong with these rich kids doing such a thing?

126
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:22,336
The rich are actually more cunning and scarier!

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,959
Really?

128
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,000
Of course.

129
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:37,974
<i>Urgent news. Second year student,
Miss K, has appeared.</i>

130
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,966
<i>What are they looking at?</i>

131
00:09:48,086 --> 00:09:52,228
<i>Didn't you rich people cause trouble too?</i>

132
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:55,272
<i>I want to see which of you did it.</i>

133
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,978
Oh, my. I didn't think a commoner
would actually be like that.

134
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:01,766
<i>Just a commoner.</i>

135
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,355
<i>She has dated a truck load of guys before.</i>

136
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,201
<i>How dirty. She's crazy.</i>

137
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,251
<i>Roll here and there. Crazy!</i>

138
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:17,809
<i>How vulgar. Go and die, Jan Di!</i>

139
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:20,539
<i>She should leave while it's early.
Who's the kid's father?</i>

140
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:25,590
<i>Forbid abortion!</i>

141
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:34,763
Why is it so quiet today?

142
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,275
What?

143
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:38,706
2,500 Won (Jan Di)

144
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:43,773
Wait and see. She'll appear in no time.

145
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,462
That girl who doesn't know her limits.

146
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:47,249
What prank have you pulled this time?

147
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:50,539
Why, so you can save her again?

148
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,975
What does that mean?

149
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:54,958
You shouldn't push it too far.

150
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:57,649
But since when did you care about all of this?

151
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,744
If you aren't going to help,
then mind your own business.

152
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:03,142
Making life difficult for a girl
is ridiculous and childish.

153
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,498
Does she look like a girl to you?

154
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:09,054
She completely disregards people, 
just like a horse or a dog.

155
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:13,277
Whether she's a horse or a dog,
she defied the Great Jun Pyo-nim.

156
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:16,105
So, I must teach her a lesson.
Don't you know the rules?

157
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:31,370
You want to erase it? What's the use?

158
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:34,080
What can you do about this?

159
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:38,826
<i>Urgent news! The true identity of
the second year student, Miss K,</i>

160
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:40,127
<i>has been confirmed to be Geum Jan Di!</i>

161
00:11:56,999 --> 00:12:01,339
Kids! Don't you smell something really gross?

162
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,266
How dirty is it? To have this gross smell.

163
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:07,793
I've only heard of how gross
the dirty clothes smell...

164
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,348
It really suffocates.

165
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,373
Sunny, give me the perfume.

166
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:22,047
How can we study in this kind of classroom?

167
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:37,680
I can't take this.

168
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,310
I can't take this anymore!

169
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,711
You can't take it?

170
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,872
So what are you going to do about it?

171
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:44,914
What can you do?

172
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,883
Speaking of the devil...

173
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:57,747
Who?

174
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,880
Who else? I was right, wasn't I?
She came looking for me.

175
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,365
If you came to apologize,
you're too late.

176
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,986
I would not quietly tolerate it anymore.

177
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:12,485
Warning. The outcome.
These words are all prepared for you, you know?!

178
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:13,786
Did you know?!

179
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,553
Hey, laundry girl.

180
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,969
Is that how you apologize among your people?

181
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,832
Then among your people,
must the victim apologize to the culprit?

182
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:33,712
What did you say?

183
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,192
You... What are you doing?

184
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:54,055
I told you, I won't sit back
and take it anymore.

185
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:57,786
I said it. I told you clearly already!

186
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:18,151
Did you see me sleeping around with a man?!

187
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,881
Did you even see me holding hands with a guy?!

188
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:24,396
How dare you spread all those rumors about 
a chaste and pure girl,

189
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,997
who hasn't even had her first kiss yet?!

190
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,925
You...!

191
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:46,035
If you keep up these filthy tricks,
I'll really kill you then!

192
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:30,495
<i>Why is he so amused?</i>

193
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,347
She actually dared to pull a spinning
back kick on the Great Gu Jun Pyo.

194
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:42,143
It has been a while since
our school's life were so fun.

195
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:47,003
But, don't you think she reminds you of someone?

196
00:15:47,123 --> 00:15:49,792
You're right. I was thinking of that too.

197
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:52,365
Who is it?

198
00:15:54,348 --> 00:15:55,763
Jun Hee noona!

199
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,727
What? Don't joke!

200
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:01,064
No, no. There're some
similarities between them.

201
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:02,459
What similarities?

202
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,680
How can you compare that
countryside girl to my sister?

203
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,944
Whether she's like your sister or not,
you'd know best.

204
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:09,535
Shut up!

205
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:13,777
But why were you laughing
to yourself just now?

206
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:16,566
Did something get to your head?

207
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,490
Haven't you guys caught on yet?

208
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,786
What?

209
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:25,204
That chick...

210
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:28,601
no matter how I think about it,
is totally into me.

211
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:30,172
What?

212
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:36,575
Gu Jun Pyo, how in the world
did you arrive at that conclusion?

213
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:38,558
You guys.

214
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,515
How can you call yourselves
experts at love or Casanova?

215
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,107
Girls always say what they don't mean.

216
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:49,193
Though that chick appears
to hate me on the surface,

217
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:52,138
she's actually totally infatuated with me.

218
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:55,123
Think about it.

219
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:57,735
She didn't want the guy
she likes to misunderstand,

220
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,749
so she came herself to
insist she was pure and innocent.

221
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,420
Following that logic...

222
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,797
...saying she hasn't had her first kiss...

223
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:11,093
...is her way of saying she's
waiting for her first kiss from me.

224
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:15,237
Bravo.

225
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,098
Impressive, Gu Jun Pyo.

226
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,808
You're my friend, but
that's really something.

227
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:22,224
That goes without saying.

228
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:26,559
There would be a day where
Gu Jun Pyo's charisma hits home.

229
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,955
I knew it was strange.

230
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:31,037
<i>The answer's the opposite.</i>

231
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:36,704
She thinks she could fool me by acting mad.

232
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:40,023
It would be burdensome too
if she was too straightforward.

233
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,810
Wouldn't it?

234
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:22,263
Even if it's like this,
I still have to come to school.

235
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:23,598
Ah, seriously.

236
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:28,150
That's why I need to kick
this impulsive bad temper.

237
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,801
Why must I go and agitate them?

238
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,809
Are you Miss Geum Jan Di?

239
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:41,108
Yes, I am.

240
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:43,406
Can you come with me for a while?

241
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:46,912
What? Where to?

242
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,310
I'm a little busy now.

243
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,138
We received orders to take you with us.

244
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,831
From whom?

245
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:57,933
You'll know when you come with us.

246
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:05,503
I have to go and work.

247
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:08,783
I'll leave first. Sorry.

248
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:17,631
Ahjussi! Why are you following me?

249
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,564
- She's not over that side?
- No, she's not.

250
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,903
We'll search one more time.
You go look over there.

251
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:37,120
Yes.

252
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,178
Let's go.

253
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:06,575
Ahjussi! Let go!

254
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,008
Let go!

255
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,086
- Stop moving!
- What are you doing?!

256
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,794
Stop moving!

257
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,076
Are you guys trying to kidnap me?

258
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:24,780
Let's move off.

259
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:36,428
<i>Ahh, what a nice fragrant.</i>

260
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:38,746
<i>Just like a garden full of flowers.</i>

261
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:41,519
<i>Warm and gentle.</i>

262
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:46,390
<i>And someone is making my body... My body...</i>

263
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,002
<i>Someone is massaging my body!</i>

264
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:57,010
There's no need to do liposuction right?

265
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,848
It's not even fat, it's just muscles.
There'll be not effect even if you do it.

266
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,321
You've prepared the laser already right?

267
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:04,110
We'll have to wax her before that.

268
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:35,958
Everyone is very curious as this
is the first time such a thing happened.

269
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:40,004
It's the first time our Young
Master has brought a girl home.

270
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:43,500
Can I ask something?

271
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,972
Yes.

272
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:51,923
So, this is in our country, Korea, right?

273
00:22:52,257 --> 00:22:54,064
Yes, that's right.

274
00:22:54,184 --> 00:22:56,593
Is this CheongWaDae* or something?
(*Korean President's house)

275
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,106
No.

276
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:02,190
Can I ask another question?

277
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,977
Yes, go ahead, Miss.

278
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:06,654
I'm not a Miss.

279
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:09,246
Just call me Jan Di. Geum Jan Di.

280
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:11,525
Yes, Miss Geum Jan Di.

281
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:16,758
Why am I here now?

282
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,784
I'm not sure about that too, Miss.

283
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:23,337
Where are we going now?

284
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:25,360
We've reached already.

285
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,591
He's waiting for you.

286
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:30,478
Waiting for me?

287
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:32,383
Who?

288
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,030
<i>Ji Hoo sunbae?</i>

289
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:28,839
You!

290
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:32,001
Why are you here for?

291
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,238
What's so strange about me being in my home?

292
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:35,458
My home?

293
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,847
So, this is Gu Jun Pyo, your house?

294
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:40,945
Yes.

295
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:43,125
Why?

296
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:47,897
What are you thinking of doing again?

297
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:51,315
I've done what I wanted to already.

298
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,551
Look.

299
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,329
You, yourself, feel shocked right?

300
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:12,727
See, money can turn even
an ugly duckling into a heron.

301
00:25:14,102 --> 00:25:15,889
Don't you mean swan?

302
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,874
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

303
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:21,873
What are you up to now?

304
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:24,269
Who asked you to do this?

305
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,840
Hey, commoner.

306
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,099
If you like me, just say so.

307
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:29,081
What?

308
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:33,578
Right, you like to talk in
opposites, don't you?

309
00:25:34,147 --> 00:25:35,364
Gu Jun Pyo.

310
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:37,250
There's a limit to the jokes you make.

311
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,747
This is illegal kidnapping!
It is an extremely terrible crime!

312
00:25:42,903 --> 00:25:46,576
Nobody's around, so you can be
open about liking me here.

313
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:49,797
From now on...

314
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:53,352
I'll be willing to make an exception
and recognize you outside of school.

315
00:25:53,472 --> 00:25:54,933
Why?

316
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,390
Did this explosive proposal scare you silly?

317
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:01,316
Shall I repeat myself?

318
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:04,301
If you just do as I say...

319
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:06,261
When nobody's around,

320
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:09,619
I can treat you as the
Almighty Jun Pyo's girlfriend.

321
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,961
Understand?

322
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:18,030
You're crazy right?

323
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:21,172
You're really crazy, huh?

324
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,492
Has your brain been addled
by too much greasy food?

325
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:29,576
Who? Become whose? What?

326
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:32,247
Forget it. I'm leaving.

327
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:39,387
You're the one whose brain
has something wrong.

328
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:41,920
Move aside while I'm being nice.

329
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:46,457
Do you know how much was
spent on you from head to toe?

330
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:49,720
100 million Won.

331
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,800
What?

332
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:53,157
100 million Won?!

333
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:54,375
That's right.

334
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:58,079
But that's nothing.

335
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:01,870
If you're with me, you can enjoy
more than that every day.

336
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,834
Are you saying you don't want it?

337
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:05,542
Are you crazy?

338
00:27:05,662 --> 00:27:08,827
Being kidnapped by a psycho like you here,

339
00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:11,557
can I still be in the right state of mind?

340
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:17,527
The moment I see your face, it feels
like bugs are crawling all over my body.

341
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:37,230
Get me my uniform now!

342
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,320
What is this?!

343
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:08,682
Throw it away!

344
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:12,198
What are you doing?

345
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:14,869
Didn't you hear me asking
you to throw it right away?

346
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:16,225
Yes, master.

347
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:17,737
And fire them all.

348
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:18,542
What?

349
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:21,822
Fire all those who waited on her today!

350
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:25,503
What's with her hair?
Her clothes too!

351
00:28:26,034 --> 00:28:28,921
Can they only do such an
old-fashioned style?

352
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,002
Find other people.

353
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,588
Find some top notch people!

354
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:37,398
All those who came today are the best staff.

355
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:40,049
Then just find even more expensive people!

356
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,157
I understand.

357
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:04,711
Hey! What's that?

358
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:08,541
Bee! Hurry up catch it!

359
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,460
Ah, bee! Hurry catch it!

360
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,801
Hurry!

361
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:28,667
Has it left?

362
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:34,002
Yes, we chased it out.

363
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,373
That tea.

364
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:53,207
Did you brew it?

365
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:56,310
Sorry, Young Master.

366
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,536
Fire her.

367
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:48,986
Why is the toilet even bigger than my house?

368
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:01,730
But, Geum Jan Di...

369
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:04,990
why were you so stumped over there?

370
00:31:07,418 --> 00:31:09,029
And one more thing.

371
00:31:10,698 --> 00:31:16,496
Seems like you don't know,
but friends can't be bought by money.

372
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:18,816
You use your heart to reach out to them.

373
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,221
There's nothing that can't
be bought by money.

374
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,344
Tell me.

375
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,095
If there's such a thing around.

376
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:38,935
Is there really something that
can't be bought using money in this world?

377
00:31:41,174 --> 00:31:45,358
If you're that confident, tell me right now.

378
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,244
Commoner...

379
00:31:58,771 --> 00:32:00,283
How embarrassing!

380
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:14,499
I'm really going crazy!

381
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:42,944
You again?

382
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:50,865
That's my line.

383
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,405
Are you going somewhere?

384
00:32:57,525 --> 00:32:58,707
Home.

385
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:01,633
You?

386
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:05,993
I'm going home too.

387
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:08,920
In this manner?

388
00:33:10,937 --> 00:33:13,903
Some situation cropped up.

389
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:18,361
Why?

390
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:22,102
Every time I see you,
you're in a dramatic situation.

391
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,303
It's a little like that right?

392
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:34,815
Can I ask you something?

393
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:42,844
Is there something in this world
that cannot be bought using money?

394
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:47,499
Even if you give millions of dollars,
you will never get it.

395
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:53,217
There isn't right?

396
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:59,423
There isn't something like that right?

397
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:01,475
Air.

398
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:02,692
What?

399
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:07,661
Oh, air.

400
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:12,409
So, that's it!

401
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:15,472
Why didn't I think of it?

402
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:19,992
<i>You're a really interesting kid.</i>

403
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:35,923
Wear it.

404
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:39,321
If you walk like that around here,
you'll get caught.

405
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:16,030
Who is this?

406
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,369
Isn't this Gu Jun Pyo's mortal enemy,
Wonder Woman?

407
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:21,078
Why are you here?

408
00:36:21,198 --> 00:36:22,512
Jun Pyo isn't here now.

409
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:25,285
Why would I come and find someone like him?

410
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:31,334
Isn't that Ji Hoo's sports shoes?

411
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,946
Help me return it to him.

412
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:44,915
Wait a moment.

413
00:36:46,577 --> 00:36:48,874
Have a cup of tea before you leave.

414
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:58,142
Did you really say that to Jun Pyo?

415
00:36:58,262 --> 00:37:01,363
Wow. You're really amazing.

416
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:05,548
No one has ever shown such
anger to him before.

417
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:08,180
Oh, it's Seo Hyun.

418
00:37:08,848 --> 00:37:11,931
She should be coming back already right?

419
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,638
Ji Hoo would be really happy.

420
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:25,851
That...

421
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:33,523
The four of you have known
each other for a very long time?

422
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:36,096
Yes, from kindergarten till now.

423
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:44,657
You seem to have something
that you're really curious about.

424
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:47,301
Ask us. We'll tell you if we know.

425
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:49,364
Take it that we're repaying you.

426
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:50,719
Repaying?

427
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:52,619
It has been really fun for us lately.

428
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,407
All thanks to you.

429
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:08,054
Are Ji Hoo sunbae and the model,
Min Seo Hyun, acquainted?

430
00:38:09,115 --> 00:38:10,883
Acquainted?

431
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:23,547
<i>When Ji Hoo was 5,
he got into a car accident.</i>

432
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:27,762
<i>His parents died on the spot,
leaving him behind.</i>

433
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:31,121
<i>Then, he retreated into autism,
ignoring everyone.</i>

434
00:38:31,532 --> 00:38:35,264
<i>The person who pulled Ji Hoo back
to the normal world was Min Seo Hyun.</i>

435
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:38,838
<i>To us, she's just our childhood playmate,
our noona and our friend.</i>

436
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:43,808
<i>But to Ji Hoo, she's like his
first love, girlfriend and mother.</i>

437
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,990
<i>How pretty.</i>

438
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,586
How can someone be so pretty?

439
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:06,689
<i>Her parents must be really happy,
having a daughter like her.</i>

440
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:09,890
She so pretty in women's eyes already.
What more men.

441
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,023
Min Seo Hyun.

442
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,419
Mom, that woman is Min Seo Hyun right?

443
00:39:16,227 --> 00:39:18,879
God is really unfair.

444
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:23,109
<i>Some people are pretty,
smart and have a good family background.</i>

445
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,700
Yet, others...

446
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:27,253
Why?

447
00:39:27,373 --> 00:39:29,964
She has broad shoulders.

448
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:36,459
You're done eating?

449
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:43,825
A stress of alpha girl takes
away her strong appetite.

450
00:39:43,945 --> 00:39:44,983
That's right.

451
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:48,911
You have eyes too.
Why don't you think of going on a diet?

452
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:52,584
But is she going to be a lawyer or a model?

453
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:54,745
Of course she should be a lawyer!

454
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:56,571
She passed such a difficult exam.

455
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:58,849
I prefer her to be a model.

456
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:01,894
That's why people say this
is the naivety of men.

457
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:04,273
When she's young, she should be a model,

458
00:40:04,393 --> 00:40:06,532
when she grows older,
she should be a lawyer.

459
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:08,417
That's my mother!

460
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:13,661
Jan Di!

461
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,991
You aren't eating your orange too right?

462
00:40:17,189 --> 00:40:19,447
<i>This is to be packed in Jan Di's lunchbox!</i>

463
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:20,645
Dad.

464
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,414
What is this?

465
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,264
What is this?

466
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:26,481
That...

467
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:27,738
What's this?

468
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,036
Thunderbird, 5,000 Won

469
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:32,629
Typhoon, 20,000 Won.

470
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:34,376
Speeding, 30,000 Won

471
00:40:34,496 --> 00:40:35,670
You!

472
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,184
I'll really win it this time!

473
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:39,225
Get out!

474
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:41,209
You might as well go to the horse
race track and live with them!

475
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:45,810
If I believe you one more time,
my name would be changed to Thunderbird!

476
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,204
<i>Get out!</i>

477
00:40:47,324 --> 00:40:50,602
Mom, Thunderbird is the worst.
The lousiest.

478
00:40:50,722 --> 00:40:52,330
You pick something else.

479
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,459
<i>She's like his first love,
girlfriend and mother.</i>

480
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:49,214
Hey! Geum Jan Di!

481
00:43:03,446 --> 00:43:04,389
Blood.

482
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,515
Serves you right.

483
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,836
<i>Serves you right.</i>

484
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:16,250
You did well.

485
00:43:18,293 --> 00:43:20,414
<i>Her nose's bleeding.</i>

486
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,707
<i>Well done!</i>

487
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,260
Don't move.

488
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,036
What were you thinking of?
Letting yourself get hit in the face.

489
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,147
Don't be like that.

490
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:39,014
What?

491
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:42,039
Don't cry.

492
00:44:42,778 --> 00:44:44,290
It doesn't suit you.

493
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:46,431
What is it to you?

494
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:49,436
Do I have to get your permission to cry now?

495
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:55,842
And weren't you the person who was
the happiest to see me crying and hurting?

496
00:44:56,746 --> 00:45:01,922
Is that all you can say
to the person who came to help?

497
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:03,709
Who asked for your help?

498
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:06,301
Who asked for your help?!

499
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:09,103
If everyone died and you were
the last person on earth,

500
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:10,604
I still wouldn't accept your help.

501
00:45:12,028 --> 00:45:15,308
I'd rather bleed to death
than be indebted to you.

502
00:45:23,632 --> 00:45:24,575
Hey.

503
00:45:28,974 --> 00:45:32,244
W... what is it you hate so much about me?

504
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:34,680
What are you not satisfied about me?

505
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,958
I'm good looking.

506
00:45:37,078 --> 00:45:39,570
I'm tall, I'm smart, I'm rich.

507
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:40,611
How...

508
00:45:41,912 --> 00:45:44,712
How can you hate Gu Jun Pyo?

509
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,439
Are you really stupid?

510
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,844
Seems like you still don't know,
I dislike everything about you!

511
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:54,811
The way you look, the way you walk,
and your stupid curly hair!

512
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:56,814
I hate everything.

513
00:45:57,872 --> 00:45:59,129
Did you eat the wrong medicine?

514
00:45:59,249 --> 00:46:00,995
I haven't finished speaking.

515
00:46:01,115 --> 00:46:03,873
It's such an eyesore to see bunch of you
wearing whatever you please to school.

516
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:06,515
And picking on weak kids for fun
with your red cards or whatever and

517
00:46:06,516 --> 00:46:07,516
your thoughtlessness.

518
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:09,776
That's the worst!

519
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:11,372
You...

520
00:46:11,492 --> 00:46:13,316
You want me to repeat myself?

521
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:14,966
All in all, Gu Jun Pyo,

522
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:18,521
I hate everything about you!
Hate everything!

523
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:52,673
<i>A month long school trip to
Europe for second and third years.</i>

524
00:47:53,772 --> 00:47:55,599
School trip?

525
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:03,663
<i>What?! 20 million won?!</i>

526
00:48:04,479 --> 00:48:06,777
That school is really amazing!

527
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:09,075
How can a school trip be 20 million won?

528
00:48:09,195 --> 00:48:10,646
Are all the students going?

529
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:12,747
No, I'm not.

530
00:48:13,076 --> 00:48:14,922
You want to go quietly,
without me knowing right?

531
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:16,513
Where can we go?

532
00:48:16,633 --> 00:48:18,516
So, what do you intend to do?

533
00:48:18,636 --> 00:48:19,729
What can I do?

534
00:48:19,849 --> 00:48:21,173
It'll just be like a month
long school holiday.

535
00:48:21,374 --> 00:48:23,574
I'll work hard and earn some money.

536
00:48:23,993 --> 00:48:27,810
Ah, my father! My father
caused trouble again!

537
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:30,756
My family is completely broke now!

538
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:33,742
South. Aren't you going to the South?

539
00:48:33,862 --> 00:48:37,004
South, what South?
Hurry go cook your porridge!

540
00:48:37,377 --> 00:48:40,579
The two of us decided not
to join the English Village.

541
00:48:40,699 --> 00:48:43,093
Let's plead our parents to
let us go on a holiday.

542
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:45,881
I wonder if there's any way
where we can play and earn money.

543
00:48:48,473 --> 00:48:51,144
It's the South Sea!

544
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:53,403
Yeah, Mom?

545
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,052
Really?

546
00:48:55,504 --> 00:48:57,645
I can go.

547
00:48:57,765 --> 00:49:00,841
But can I go with Jan Di?

548
00:49:02,236 --> 00:49:03,277
Really?

549
00:49:03,397 --> 00:49:05,948
You'll plead Aunty right?

550
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,090
But you must guarantee the 70000 Won pay!

551
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:17,927
See, didn't I say you girls would go.

552
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:20,971
<i>You're going to the South Sea right?</i>

553
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:28,672
Hey! Are the two of you
going to keep pacing up and down?

554
00:49:31,815 --> 00:49:34,878
- Isn't Jun Pyo sunbae really handsome?
- He's exceptionally handsome today!

555
00:49:34,998 --> 00:49:36,955
Gu Jun Pyo!

556
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:38,820
Are you waiting for someone too?

557
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,274
Waiting what?

558
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,691
Since we have to take a long plane flight,
I must do sufficient exercise first.

559
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:45,682
Hey.

560
00:49:45,802 --> 00:49:48,353
But why must you insist going together
with the rest of the students this time?

561
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:50,877
Don't you want to use your
private jet and not suffer all this?

562
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:53,527
This is a school trip.

563
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:56,277
Such suffering would be
a memory of my high school life.

564
00:49:56,397 --> 00:49:57,867
Isn't it, Ji Hoo?

565
00:49:57,987 --> 00:49:58,751
What?

566
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,854
Yo, yo, yo. Let's go.

567
00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:11,903
Why isn't that girl coming?

568
00:50:38,387 --> 00:50:40,154
Wow. Isn't that Min Seo Hyun?

569
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:41,676
Wow, she looks great!

570
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:43,326
<i>We're so lucky.</i>

571
00:50:43,446 --> 00:50:44,975
Take a picture for me.

572
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,366
Look here, look here.

573
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:49,780
<i>Her face is really petite.</i>

574
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,725
<i>Her skin! Wow.</i>

575
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:13,854
Ah, it's Min Seo Hyun!

576
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:15,759
She's so pretty!

577
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:20,335
<i>Sign for me, please!</i>

578
00:51:34,484 --> 00:51:37,066
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

579
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:47,522
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

580
00:51:47,642 --> 00:51:48,995
Let's go.

581
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,357
I don't like that picture.

582
00:52:24,153 --> 00:52:24,978
Hello.

583
00:52:26,938 --> 00:52:31,160
Excuse me. I'm sorry but you can't
use your mobile phone on board.

584
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:35,619
W... What?

585
00:52:37,682 --> 00:52:39,528
Wh... Where did she go?

586
00:52:39,852 --> 00:52:46,986
<i>To catch fish, we went to the ocean.</i>

587
00:52:47,106 --> 00:52:51,205
<i>- Put them in a cage
- Fill up a cage.</i>

588
00:52:51,325 --> 00:52:53,073
Isn't it put them in?

589
00:52:53,193 --> 00:52:55,155
Isn't it fill it up?

590
00:52:55,275 --> 00:53:01,999
<i>To catch fish, we went to the ocean.</i>

591
00:53:16,078 --> 00:53:17,767
Hey, Dry Cleaner.

592
00:53:20,104 --> 00:53:21,891
Ah, ahh. Can you hear me?

593
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:23,109
Commoner!

594
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:30,235
What was that?

595
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:34,597
Ka Wol, am I having a dream now?

596
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:36,817
I don't think so.

597
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:42,263
But I keep hearing that
irritating guy's voice.

598
00:54:03,472 --> 00:54:06,587
I heard the commoner went to the sea.

599
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:08,885
Look at yourself.

600
00:54:09,005 --> 00:54:12,676
Hey! Why are you guys here?

601
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:16,716
Aren't you supposed to go
to North Europe or Fjord?

602
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,975
We've gone there one or twice.

603
00:54:19,095 --> 00:54:20,900
Sick of it already.

604
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:27,027
We wanted to look for some new
place and somebody recommended here.

605
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:30,778
What a total coincidence, huh?

606
00:54:30,898 --> 00:54:34,136
I had no idea you'd be here, Dry Cleaner

607
00:54:34,256 --> 00:54:37,107
Then go on your own route!

608
00:54:37,227 --> 00:54:39,719
Pretend not to know me and
I'd be really grateful!

609
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,901
That boat is just made of wood.
Will it be OK?

610
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,399
Even though it's small, it's still a boat!

611
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:47,677
None of your business!

612
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,366
Really?

613
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:52,980
True. You wouldn't drown
even if it capsizes.

614
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,356
You know how to swim right?

615
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,659
Then, let's move off!

616
00:55:11,996 --> 00:55:14,627
You... this jerk! Gu Jun Pyo!

617
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:19,811
Gu Jun Pyo!

618
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:24,285
So cold!

619
00:55:55,023 --> 00:55:57,242
Isn't that Min Seo Hyun?

620
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,240
Hey, Dry Cleaner.

621
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:32,087
What now?!

622
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:35,998
Honestly, you're very happy to
meet me at a place like this, right?

623
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:37,177
Tell me.

624
00:56:37,297 --> 00:56:39,710
You were very bored on
that fish-like smelling boat.

625
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,265
I was very happy before I met you.

626
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:47,581
No matter what,
since you're a student of our school,

627
00:56:47,701 --> 00:56:49,683
come if you want to.

628
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:54,795
Though I don't know where to,
I don't have any intention to go!

629
00:57:08,247 --> 00:57:11,861
There's a welcome party for that person.
It'll be fun.

630
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:14,328
You should come too.
You'll come right?

631
00:57:15,722 --> 00:57:17,431
Yes, I'll come.

632
00:57:17,551 --> 00:57:19,601
I'll definitely come.

633
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,041
Hey! You!

634
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:31,658
I know what you're going to say.

635
00:57:31,778 --> 00:57:34,643
I don't really want to go too.

636
00:57:34,938 --> 00:57:36,627
Come on.

637
00:57:36,747 --> 00:57:40,085
Both Jun Pyo and Ji Hoo
have extended their invitation.

638
00:57:40,205 --> 00:57:41,891
You must come.

639
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:44,523
Am I right?

640
00:57:45,584 --> 00:57:46,546
Yes.

641
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:50,258
But, they left out something.

642
00:57:50,802 --> 00:57:52,609
Left out something?

643
00:57:53,395 --> 00:57:55,398
Why? Why?

644
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:57,185
Come here.

645
00:57:57,305 --> 00:57:58,874
Let's go.

646
00:58:29,415 --> 00:58:30,830
Is this really OK?

647
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:32,440
It's OK. It's OK.

648
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,300
Once you go in, there'll be some
even more exaggerated than yours.

649
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,736
This doesn't even count as anything.

650
00:58:38,856 --> 00:58:42,114
No, but it's so embarrassing.

651
00:58:42,234 --> 00:58:43,365
What?

652
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:46,351
This concept fits you to the tee!

653
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:47,568
Don't worry.

654
00:58:47,688 --> 00:58:49,689
Geum Jan Di, fighting!

655
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:53,284
Let's go. I should just go back.

656
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:57,383
Love can only be obtained
by those with courage.

657
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:37,667
What kind and beautiful? Try getting
caught by me, you're dead!

658
01:00:37,787 --> 01:00:43,788
Geum Jan Di, why did you
believe what they say?

659
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:47,893
You're so stupid. Stupid.

660
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:55,233
Geum Jan Di!

661
01:00:59,063 --> 01:00:59,868
You!

662
01:01:00,764 --> 01:01:02,078
You're late.

663
01:01:02,198 --> 01:01:03,914
We didn't know that you're here.

664
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:05,576
We have been looking for you.

665
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:07,835
You haven't taken off your coat.

666
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,799
Don't you feel hot?

667
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:14,096
It's not hot. I'm still feeling very
cold from the sea breeze.

668
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:18,024
Is it because your dress is too thin?

669
01:01:18,144 --> 01:01:22,640
The latest designs are really pretty,
but they expose a little too much.

670
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,427
Is yours like that too?

671
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,293
Hurry take it off!

672
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:28,866
Let's not waste time. Take it off for her.

673
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,726
Wonder woman? What is this?

674
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,235
Oh, my. What is this?

675
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:53,944
Isn't this Wonder Woman?

676
01:01:54,064 --> 01:01:56,262
You were hailed as Wonder
Woman on the internet.

677
01:01:56,382 --> 01:01:58,616
Now you can't even differentiate
between reality and your own imagination?

678
01:01:58,736 --> 01:02:01,366
If you didn't have a dress,
you should've said.

679
01:02:01,486 --> 01:02:03,821
I understand that you're
trying to stand out.

680
01:02:03,941 --> 01:02:06,355
But this is a little over the top, commoner.

681
01:02:06,475 --> 01:02:10,053
Maybe the commoners enjoy doing this lately.

682
01:02:13,824 --> 01:02:16,436
She's really dressed as Wonder Woman.

683
01:02:47,939 --> 01:02:50,158
I know why you did this.

684
01:02:50,678 --> 01:02:57,572
But do you know that this
proves how low you are, not her?

685
01:02:59,516 --> 01:03:02,647
What are you doing Ji Hoo?
Hurry help her to my room.

686
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:21,851
This Ji Hoo. Why is he doing
these unfathomable things?

687
01:03:21,971 --> 01:03:25,032
I don't know what this is about
but isn't it fun?

688
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:10,416
Thank you.

689
01:04:10,536 --> 01:04:12,911
You don't have to go to this extent.

690
01:04:13,964 --> 01:04:17,342
It's what I'd like to do
so don't feel burdened.

691
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:21,309
This isn't a place where I'm
supposed to be from the beginning.

692
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:23,469
Ji Hoo invited you right?

693
01:04:24,172 --> 01:04:28,394
If you're Ji Hoo's friend,
then you're a precious friend to me too.

694
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:30,575
No.

695
01:04:31,478 --> 01:04:33,776
That was just out of courtesy.

696
01:04:34,897 --> 01:04:35,683
No.

697
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:39,061
Ji Hoo is not someone like that.

698
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:42,125
And to stand up for someone like this,

699
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,363
it's that first time I'm seeing him do that.

700
01:04:46,754 --> 01:04:49,739
Ji Hoo sunbae has always been so attentive.

701
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:52,666
Ji Hoo is attentive?

702
01:04:55,022 --> 01:04:56,613
See what I mean.

703
01:04:56,733 --> 01:04:59,520
That's because Jan Di is a special person.

704
01:05:01,405 --> 01:05:04,626
I heard you've suffered a
lot because of Jun Pyo.

705
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:08,902
I heard that you swore that
you'll never bow down to him.

706
01:05:09,668 --> 01:05:11,573
That's...

707
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,558
It's because he's lonely.

708
01:05:15,401 --> 01:05:16,402
What?

709
01:05:16,932 --> 01:05:21,155
He's wrapping his loneliness with violence.

710
01:05:23,374 --> 01:05:25,378
Gu Jun Pyo is lonely?

711
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:27,455
How can that be?

712
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:33,543
He can be with his parents
only a month per year.

713
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:37,039
From the moment he was born,

714
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:39,739
he wasn't a normal son or friend.

715
01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:43,825
He was treated as their
heir of their company.

716
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:46,928
Can you imagine how it feels?

717
01:05:51,195 --> 01:05:53,276
Don't lose to him.

718
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:56,046
What?

719
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:59,941
I like Jan Di, so I'll cheer you on.

720
01:06:05,204 --> 01:06:06,933
We're done.

721
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:09,521
Get up.

722
01:06:36,822 --> 01:06:38,806
They're so pretty.

723
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:43,417
To women, shoes are the most important.

724
01:06:44,615 --> 01:06:46,166
Why?

725
01:06:47,954 --> 01:06:52,245
Good shoes take you to good places.

726
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:59,630
You're ready.

727
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:02,983
Shall we go out now?

728
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,921
It's not gentlemanly to
ignore such a beautiful lady.

You finished drinking all of these?

736
01:08:43,949 --> 01:08:46,303
Hey. Wake up, you... this woman!

737
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:48,719
Yes, I'm a woman.

738
01:08:50,015 --> 01:08:53,138
I can't do anything.

739
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:59,736
<i>Geum Jan Di is a sly snake
hidden under an innocent demeanor.</i>

740
01:08:59,856 --> 01:09:02,367
When I first saw her, I knew it already.

741
01:09:02,487 --> 01:09:08,174
A person that Ji Hoo would smile
whenever he mentions would be Jan Di.

742
01:09:08,294 --> 01:09:11,532
Geum Jan Di is pretty when
she dolls herself up.

743
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:14,439
It's not like an ugly duckling became a swan.

744
01:09:14,559 --> 01:09:19,606
<i>Ji Hoo would have liked you
if he met you first.</i>

745
01:09:19,726 --> 01:09:21,551
<i>What gives you the right to do this?</i>

746
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:24,870
It's because Sunbae is in so much pain.

747
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,981
What is it to you?

748
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:29,476
Get lost!
