00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,412
Next, we have news about Shinhwa Group.

4
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:10,891
<i>Shinhwa Group, which went into crisis
when Gu Bon Hyung passed away,</i>

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,209
<i>has announced the plan
of an international resort</i>

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,610
<i>based in Macau and Inchon.</i>

7
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:18,171
<i>Stating it to be a turning point
that will change the crisis into bliss,</i>

8
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,047
Implementing a worldwide ambitious plan.

9
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:23,486
What makes it special is the person
in charge of the plan.

10
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:26,671
<i>The future successor
of Shinhwa Group, Gu Jun Pyo,</i>

11
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:29,427
and this has raised a
lot of unusual attention.

12
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:37,185
{\a6}- Episode 13

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,389
There is still no news?

14
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:41,782
It's already half a year.

15
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:45,936
No matter how busy or tired,
he should have called.

16
00:00:47,863 --> 00:00:50,990
Also you haven't been contacting F4?

17
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:56,110
Seems like everyone is a bit careful.

18
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,110
Seems like everyone is busy.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,862
They are all busy after attending
university, right?

20
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,930
Yah, it's obvious without even thinking.

21
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,409
They’ve probably forgotten

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,180
all about so-called friends
and gone girl-crazy

23
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,659
Even their souls have left them.

24
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:15,688
Hey, what are you doing?

25
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:17,460
Really old-fashioned.

26
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:20,063
I also went to the Blue House!
Why are you like this?

27
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:24,563
<i>Not staying in the kitchen
and all you know is sleep.</i>

28
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:29,403
Your restaurant business is
really that good? Tsk, tsk, tsk

29
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,172
That grandfather is here again.

30
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:36,688
Grandfather,

31
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,659
what are you having today?

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,085
ShinSeolRo. (Korean royal cuisine)

33
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:42,472
Shin, shin, SeolRo?

34
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,753
What is that Grandfather?

35
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:46,772
Isn't he a bit much?

36
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,909
Grandfather,

37
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,210
why are you acting like
this in a porridge shop?

38
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,332
The things he ordered, were either
noodles with soybean paste

39
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,533
or spicy soup with sheatfish.

40
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:56,202
half dried saury, 3 combination...
And what else?

41
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:56,103
{\a6}(Sam Hab: 3 combination of Fermented Skate,
Kimchi, Pork - Eat 3 together with chopstick)

42
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:59,126
The soup... that soup...

43
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:00,649
What was it?

44
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,170
Ahh, soup...

45
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:09,502
Just like your boss,
so young and ignorant.

46
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,367
It's Tang Pyung Chae, you idiots!

47
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:13,096
Ah, Tang Pyung Chae.

48
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,097
{\a6}(various steamed and seasoned vegetable)

49
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,991
Stop grumbling and talking back to an elder.

50
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:19,127
Quickly get something to eat here.

51
00:02:58,271 --> 00:02:59,500
Grandfather...

52
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:01,813
Is it that delicious?

53
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,626
What delicious?!

54
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,251
I'm afraid that I will go
to hell if I waste food,

55
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,096
so I ate it half-heartedly.

56
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:10,188
Can't you see?

57
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:13,803
Being half-hearted twice, then you
should have eaten the bowl as well.

58
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:18,056
Tell this to your Cook,
it is a waste of the bowl.

59
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:21,616
It is not the Cook, but Master.

60
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:24,313
What is that that he Mastered?

61
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:31,116
<i>Grandfather!</i>

62
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:34,659
It is raining outside and you did
not bring your umbrella right?

63
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:37,471
Please remember to return
it to us next time.

64
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,345
No matter how I look...

65
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:42,753
Face of a lotus.

66
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:44,212
Lotus?

67
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:48,628
Do you know why the lotus
flower blooms in the mud?

68
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:50,188
Huh?

69
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,845
This is your homework till
we meet again next time.

70
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:57,461
Bye.

71
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,157
Jan Di.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,500
You better remember.

73
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:04,688
What?

74
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:07,022
He is not one that will
speak without reason.

75
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:08,407
Understand?

76
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,407
<i>What?! Really.</i>

77
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:12,898
<i>Master, do talk about it.</i>

78
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,845
We are not even playing riddles here.

79
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:26,376
[Blue House Head Chef Bom Seong Chan]

80
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:26,377
{\a6}Blue House is the Presidential
Residence (like the White House)

81
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:41,985
Noona.

82
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:44,712
Do you think it resembles Jun Pyo Hyung?

83
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:45,744
Look!

84
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,729
<i>Curly hair.</i>

85
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,546
Pouting lips.

86
00:04:49,953 --> 00:04:51,287
<i>What resemblance?</i>

87
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:54,495
Since when is that kid so cute, and gentle?

88
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:56,298
The cat will get angry hearing that.

89
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,057
Yes, yes, don't even look like it.

90
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:03,456
For Mr. Jun Pyo, he looks
more like a tiger. Right?

91
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:06,838
Noona.

92
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,775
Is your shoulder in pain again?

93
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:11,245
No, it's ok.

94
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:13,870
My shoulder hurts too.

95
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:17,589
Curling my legs together
and doing this thing everyday.

96
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:23,182
It's so painful, at least Jan Di
can relax by swimming.

97
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:24,119
Wife.

98
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,463
Why don't we help you relax?

99
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:28,808
- Kang San, let's go!
- OK!

100
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:33,241
Come.

101
00:05:37,285 --> 00:05:38,868
Kang San, Kang San?

102
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,848
<i>Be gentler Kang San.</i>

103
00:05:41,944 --> 00:05:43,880
<i>Pain, pain! Kang San, be gentler!</i>

104
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:15,285
Stupid!

105
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,617
You didn't go to the moon.

106
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:20,973
Why can't you just give a call?

107
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:22,526
You.

108
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:23,957
When you come back,

109
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,431
you are going to die.

110
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:39,901
<i>I will be back soon.</i>

111
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,879

Hello?

114
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:06,394
Yes, I am.

115
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,756
Really?

116
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,832
Really?

117
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:18,207
Mom! Dad!

118
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:20,411
Why are you screaming in
the middle of the night?

119
00:07:20,412 --> 00:07:22,848
Is it Jun Pyo? Did he call?

120
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,559
Mom, Dad is being accepted!

121
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:26,972
What?!

122
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:29,193
I just received the call.

123
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:30,818
Hello?

124
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,536
Yes, I am Geum Il Bong.

Yes, 8 am tomorrow morning.

127
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:38,223
Yes. I know, I will be there!

128
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,474
Yes! This is great!

129
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,668
Yes, Section Chief.

130
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,973
Thank you.

131
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:55,566
Please do not let the people on
that side know, and handle it well.

<i>Shinhwa Group, which went into crisis

<i>implementing a worldwide ambitious plan.</i>

135
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,363
It's been tiring.

136
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:25,379
Are you okay?

137
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:30,316
Yes... I'm fine... Thank you.

138

<i>Wife!</i>

139
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,876
Why are you in a daze?

140
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:51,909
- Husband.
- In the day...

141
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,550
have you seen a ghost?

142
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:56,110
Pinch me.

143
00:10:00,945 --> 00:10:04,127
I only heard that he looks
like a living statue,

144
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:05,891
so it is true.

145
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,828
You have not been to the hospital?

146
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:22,321
I went.

147
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,297
I went already.

148
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:26,078
He said it was alright.

149
00:11:50,598 --> 00:11:52,016
What are you doing?

150
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:54,110
So, say it now.

151
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,537
Say what?

152
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,111
The things that you want to tell Jun Pyo.

153
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:02,143
Someone is going over to Jun Pyo.

154
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:03,798
Ever since the funeral,

155
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,986
We haven't contact him as well.

156
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:08,256
But it will definitely reach this time.

157
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,424
Sunbae, this is too sudden.

158
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:17,351
I... have nothing to say.

159
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,424
Here, let's start.

160
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:30,095
I don't really know how to do this.

161
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,174
Gu Jun Pyo.

162
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,821
Can you hear me?

163
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:50,837
While you have been away,
I've thought of you everyday...

164
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:56,645
But why do I only remember us fighting?

165
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,773
Still, isn’t it strange?

166
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:08,149
I only remember us fighting and
getting mad all the time,

167
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,061
but when I think about you, I laugh.

168
00:13:20,782 --> 00:13:21,735
Gu Jun Pyo.

169
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:27,661
you’re okay, right?

170
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:33,546
When are you going to come
back and fight with me?

171
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:21,541
Am I that handsome?

172
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:30,057
That's right, there's not one woman who
doesn't get smitten at this sight.

173
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:31,923
Who is smitten?

174
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,744
I came because I have something to ask.

175
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:36,838
About Jun Pyo and Jan Di?

176
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:39,777
Yes.

177
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:45,892
Say it.

178
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:48,731
What?

179
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:50,559
Is it still the same?

180
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:53,807
Waiting for the love that
occurs once in a lifetime.

181
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,454
This does not concern you.

182
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,463
Do you think Jun Pyo is
the one love for Jan Di?

183
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:07,891
Is he really her soulmate?

184
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:10,558
That?

185
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,401
Ga Eul, you, just pushed your
dream into Jan Di's mind.

186
00:17:15,871 --> 00:17:17,901
What did you say?

187
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:21,861
If it were me, I’d spend my whole
life looking for my soulmate

188
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:26,369
although I’m not even sure
stuff like that exists.

189
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,619
Seems like I have really came
to the wrong place.

190
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:34,277
Then I shall leave first.

191
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:49,547
Sunbae believes it too right?

192
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:56,954
Soulmates, may be life's
one and only real love.

193
00:17:56,955 --> 00:18:01,777
Sunbae, you also believe that it exists.

194
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:04,047
What?

195
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:07,963
They say a strong denial
is like an affirmation.

196
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:11,391
I think I understand now.

197
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,892
Sunbae, you do believe they exist.

198
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:18,013
You’re afraid that they do.

199
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:19,641
Why is that?

200
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:23,309
Don’t act like you know me so easily.

201
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:29,026
Today’s the first time I feel like Sunbae's
a real person.

202
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,340
<i>I’m glad I came after all.</i>

203
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,455
As for Jan Di's problem,
we will talk about it next time.

204
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,266
<i>That's all...</i>

205
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,589
Please eat.

206
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,203
Hey kid!

207
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,620
The food may be sectioned off in the plate
but look at the food's presentation!

208
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:30,371
Look at this presentation.

209
00:19:30,714 --> 00:19:32,619
Looks appetizing.

210
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:35,047
Why don't you both try as well?

211
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,464
Really?

212
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:55,987
- Delicious!
- Delicious!

213
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,401
Have you done your homework?

214
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:05,620
Homework?

215
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,089
Yes.

216
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,486
There is a call.

217
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:17,339
Ji Hoo sunbae?

218
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,277
Now?

219
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:25,026
I'll leave first.

220
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:42,527
Sunbae!

221
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,588
Aigoo, this is really unappetizing.

222
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,465
That?

223
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:53,151
What kid?

224
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:56,559
What should I prepare for you next time?

225
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,017
So much rejections is still not enough?

226
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,924
What you are best at.

227
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:05,829
Do something that is not
worse than your dad.

228
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:07,995
Yes!

229
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:09,526
Kid!

230
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:16,112
It's so sudden. What's up?

231
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,888
Bring you to a place.

232
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,237
Where?

233
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:21,119
You will know when you reach.

234
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:12,544
<i>You have such an acute shoulder injury,
why didn't you attend to it earlier?</i>

235
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:17,244
<i>If you start treatment now,
it will not effect your daily life,</i>

236
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:19,370
<i>but for swimming...</i>

237
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,574
I know it clearly.

238
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:01,942
I’m not pretty.

239
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:04,943
I’m not smart.

240
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:08,144
I’m not rich.

241
00:23:10,028 --> 00:23:11,668
But...

242
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:15,808
There was something I liked,

243
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:22,458
that I could do better than other people.

244
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:34,091
They say I have to quit.

245
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:38,482
I cannot swim anymore.

246
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,403
What do I do now?

247
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,328
What can I do in the future?

248
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:12,557
Start looking for a new one now.

249
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,870
Sunbae does music.

250
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,527
Yi Jun Sunbae does clay modeling.

251
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:29,439
Gu Jun Pyo and Woo Bin sunbae will
definitely take over the family business.

252
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,495
Everyone is walking towards
their destined path.

253
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:41,422
But I don't know what I can do.

254
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:06,683
I will help you.

255
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,809
Let me help you.

256
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:13,371
Let’s figure it out together.

257
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,982
Sit down.

258
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:04,481
It is because of me.

259
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:06,054
That accident.

260
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,024
Huh?

261
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:12,243
I can remember it vaguely.

262
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:15,710
While playing in the back seat,

263
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:18,638
I covered the eyes of my
father who was driving.

264
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:22,117
Both of them held me so
tightly in their embrace.

265
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:25,835
Everyone said it was a miracle.

266
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:29,649
Later Grandfather...

267
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:33,045
Never came back to this house.

268
00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:37,400
He must have hated the grandson

269
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:40,368
who killed his own son.

270
00:26:43,587 --> 00:26:45,461
That time...

271
00:26:45,462 --> 00:26:48,586
She held my hand,
allowing me to start afresh.

272
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,335
That person.

273
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:12,804
This time is probably...

274
00:27:13,514 --> 00:27:14,868
My turn.

275
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:38,370
<i>What are you doing?</i>

276
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:41,120
<i>Sunbae, you can only do this much?</i>

277
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:42,996
<i>Go after her!</i>

278
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:45,275
<i>If that person cannot be here,</i>

279
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:48,087
<i>then can't Sunbae
go to be by her?</i>

280
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:49,838
<i>Didn't you say you love her?</i>

281
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,307
<i>Is waiting Sunbae's love?</i>

282
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:55,308
<i>Do you have the right to
say you love her like this?</i>

283
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:25,634
<i>Ga Eul, this is what
Oppa just did. How is it?</i>

284
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,486
<i>That's why.</i>

285
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:30,184
Ah, this better be delicious.

286
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:33,808
How's the taste?

287
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,060
That I... Uh...

288
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,183
Can you pay me in advance?

289
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:42,424
Huh?

290
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:43,714
Pay in advance.

291
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,088
Jan Di, did your dad
get into trouble again?

292
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:47,557
No.

293
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:50,330
I need it for something.

294
00:29:50,641 --> 00:29:52,141
How much do you need?

295
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,579
2 million.

296
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:59,495
Why do you need 2 million, so much?

297
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,808
I want to buy an air ticket.

298
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:03,651
But an air ticket?

299
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:06,650
Are you thinking...?

300
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:11,173
Jan Di, can't you see this?

301
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:14,547
To a flower boy, skin is their life.

302
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:17,433
I had pimples these few days due to stress.

303
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:20,081
I also really want to give you...

304
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:23,463
But this has to sell well
before I can give you.

305
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,090
<i>Hmm, this smells so nice.</i>

306
00:30:28,587 --> 00:30:31,843
So if I sell one, you'll give me 500 won.

307
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:34,637
If I sell 100, then 50,000 won.

308
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:37,370
If I sell 1000, then 500,000 won.

309
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:38,804
Let's do it!

310
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:40,331
Here you go!

311
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:45,790
Jeul Pan!

312
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:47,403
What's Jeul Pan?

313
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,283
It means Jeulguhoon (exciting)
Panmae (sales).

314
00:30:51,802 --> 00:30:54,057
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

315
00:30:54,827 --> 00:30:56,794
We have a new kind of porridge!

316
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,083
Try some!

317
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:12,030
How are you going to sell
all of it like this?

318
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:13,831
You have to eat some porridge,
valued customer!

319
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:17,382
He has to eat porridge in the morning?

320
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,298
It's cold.

321
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,275
Please come eat!

322
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:33,868
Customer! One-plus-one!

323
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:46,292
We have warm porridge for you!

324
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:48,336
<i>We'll take responsibility for the taste!</i>

325
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:55,058
Are you really going to take
responsibility, Miss?

326
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:56,712
Of course...

327
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,773
Come inside and eat some!

328
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:24,824
The warm porridge is inside!

329
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:32,281
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

330
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:42,096
You like this?

331
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:44,717
You'll probably like it.

332
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:02,917
<i>Good job.</i>

333
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:07,793
And Jan Di will do the calculations?

334
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:11,223
Wow.

335
00:33:13,763 --> 00:33:17,011
I really didn't know I was
going to earn this much!

336
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:22,436
But I didn't earn this on my own...
Is it really okay for me to have it all?

337
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:23,654
You can take it.

338
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:25,765
It was pretty fun for us too.

339
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:29,278
But... why did you suddenly come and visit?

340
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:36,997
You have to come somewhere with us.

341
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:50,752
Swimmer, on your mark.

342
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:05,470
<i>Get set.</i>

343
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:08,659
Go!

344
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:18,676
Now...

345
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:23,525
Now,

346
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:29,366
We will start the retirement ceremony
for athlete Geum Jan Di.

347
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:34,463
First, we will present the
Award for Excellence.

348
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:43,791
Award for Excellence, Shinhwa High,
Geum Jan Di.

349
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:47,581
We present this award to the above person,

350
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:51,481
who has innate nosiness and
the foundation of weeds,

351
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:55,474
who has attended the brutal aristocratic
Shinhwa Intuition as its only swimmer

352
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,563
and an active participant in the event
of training F4 and Gu Jung Pyo

353
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:00,926
with the refusal to obey,

354
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:06,982
expressing unique abilities that highlighted
the athlete's pride and dignity.

355
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:09,578
On behalf of the F4.

356
00:37:25,055 --> 00:37:26,396
<i>Geum Jan Di.</i>

357
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:31,219
You know that an end signals
a new beginning, right?

358
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,910
Now go to Macau and give Jun Pyo
what he rightfully deserves.

359
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:40,121
Thank you.

360
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:41,420
Jan Di.

361
00:37:43,323 --> 00:37:46,115
Have a safe trip.

362
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,414
I'll return safely!

363
00:38:09,352 --> 00:38:12,275
<i>Macau Airport</i>

364
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:43,114
19,700 won!

365
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:57,739
Isn't that too expensive?

366
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,923
How can I ride a taxi for 19,700 won!

367
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,355
This is all Gu Jun Pyo's?!

368
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:11,272
They did say Shinhwa is inside the resort,

369
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:13,521
but it's only hitting me now.

370
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:18,429
But... where is the entrance?

371
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:45,914
<i>Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

372
00:41:45,915 --> 00:41:47,382
<i>Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

373
00:42:44,368 --> 00:42:45,510
I'm right!

374
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:47,100
Ask him!

375
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:51,420
Okay, I'm going! I'm going!

376
00:42:54,431 --> 00:42:55,981
Gu Jun?

377
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:25,386
It's delicious.

378
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:27,086
Can I try this?

379
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:35,075
This is perfect as appetizers
for Dad when he drinks.

380
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:36,498
How much?

381
00:45:38,399 --> 00:45:39,699
How much?

382
00:45:45,872 --> 00:45:48,272
Return the wallet while I'm still nice.

383
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:49,445
Wallet?

384
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:53,741
<i>My Wallet!</i>

385
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,582
My Wallet!

386
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,440
Robber!

387
00:45:59,952 --> 00:46:01,760
Are you Korean? Thank you!

388
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:07,272
<i>Stay still.</i>

389
00:46:08,373 --> 00:46:11,173
Hey, you!
You speak any English?

390
00:46:11,374 --> 00:46:14,774
I'm a black belt holder of Taekwondo.
You know.

391
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:15,975
You know Taekwondo.

392
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:18,421
Fine.

393
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:22,319
Let her go while I'm nice.
You're still not letting her go!

394
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,759
Your crime is getting serious by the minute.

395
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,446
You were a simple pickpocket a second ago,
but now you're holding a hostage!

396
00:46:28,447 --> 00:46:30,561
Go! Get away!

397
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,303
You're such a frustrating man.

398
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:35,791
I gave you a chance.

399
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,923
If you hate me afterwards,
that's just unfair, okay?

400
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:41,811
When I count to three,
bite his arm with all your strength!

401
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:43,133
Huh?

402
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:44,338
Do you not know Korean?

403
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:46,034
I... I do.

404
00:46:46,457 --> 00:46:48,877
- 1... 2...
- Wait!

405
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:50,410
What?

406
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:54,380
Is it 1, 2, 3 and bite or 1, 2 and bite?

407
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:57,162
You're a weird girl, aren't you!

408
00:46:57,699 --> 00:46:59,069
1, 2, 3…NOW!

409
00:46:59,070 --> 00:46:59,945
Huh?

410
00:47:03,146 --> 00:47:04,346
You want to kill me?

411
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,758
Your wallet.

412
00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:20,695
Thank you.

413
00:47:30,628 --> 00:47:31,814
Let's run for now.

414
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,065
It'll be complicated if we get caught.

415
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:47,163
I don't know how to thank you.

416
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:51,999
I know how it feels to meet a
Korean in a foreign country now.

417
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:54,869
<i>Is this your first time abroad?</i>

418
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,990
<i>It's my first time alone.</i>

419
00:47:58,257 --> 00:48:00,359
Why Macau of all places?

420
00:48:00,984 --> 00:48:03,188
I came to find someone.

421
00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:05,556
Ah! Your boyfriend?

422
00:48:07,162 --> 00:48:09,158
Yeah? I guess.

423
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:10,989
I'm envious.

424
00:48:11,549 --> 00:48:13,608
It's not really a situation
to be envious of.

425
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:14,570
Oh, yeah?

426
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:17,051
Honey, you wanted beef jerky, right?

427
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:18,519
Follow me.

428
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,905
Honey?

429
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,354
- One sheet for 10 dollars?
- True

430
00:48:50,858 --> 00:48:55,523
We'll buy 10, so give it
to us for 70 dollars.

431
00:48:55,524 --> 00:48:56,585
No, no!

432
00:48:56,586 --> 00:49:00,043
Hey! Then I'm not going to buy.
I'm not going to buy

433
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:01,872
Okay, okay.

434
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:08,104
Great, then 70 dollars!

435
00:49:10,094 --> 00:49:13,884
I bargained 30 dollars off for
buying mine and yours, honey.

436
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:16,088
There's no business without bargaining.

437
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:39,687
It was nice meeting you.

438
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,621
Be careful when you travel.

439
00:49:41,622 --> 00:49:43,335
It was nice meeting you.

440
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:50,886
Wait! Can I get your name?

441
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:54,192
Me? Jae Kyung. Ha Jae Kyung.

442
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:07,642
Hey! My name is Geum Jan Di...

443
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:18,391
Is this a hotel or a cathedral?

444
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,120
Sorry, are you OK?

445
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:15,521
O... Okay.

446
00:53:58,121 --> 00:53:59,959
He didn't see me.

447
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,862
Even if he did, he probably
didn't know it was me.

448
00:54:02,863 --> 00:54:06,374
That's right. It's weird for me
to just suddenly show up in Macau.

449
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,157
That's the weird thing.

450
00:54:08,574 --> 00:54:12,620
That's really, most definitely weird.

451
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:41,070
Are you okay, Young Master?

452
00:54:41,071 --> 00:54:42,207
What?

453
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:44,503
Just now, Miss Geum Jan Di?

454
00:54:44,504 --> 00:54:47,546
When is JK Group coming?

455
00:54:47,547 --> 00:54:51,992
If that goes wrong, the Witch might kill me,

456
00:54:51,993 --> 00:54:54,156
So keep reminding me.

457
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:23,526
Cheap!

458
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:26,705
You have a cheap room?

459
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,294
It's okay. I'll carry it.

460
00:55:30,595 --> 00:55:33,226
No it's okay, I'll carry it.

461
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,067
Hey! Hey! Hey!

462
00:55:58,918 --> 00:56:00,220
Stop right there!

463
00:56:00,432 --> 00:56:02,429
If I catch you, you're dead!

464
00:56:05,713 --> 00:56:07,926
Hey! Stop!

465
00:56:09,352 --> 00:56:11,088
Stop right there.

466
00:56:11,089 --> 00:56:13,007
Give me back my bag!

467
00:56:16,987 --> 00:56:21,965
I have a little brother just
like you, so I'll let you go.

468
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:23,350
So give me my bag.

469
00:56:23,451 --> 00:56:25,351
You idiot

470
00:56:25,688 --> 00:56:26,934
How dare you wave your finger at me?

471
00:56:26,935 --> 00:56:28,306
Do you want to die?

472
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:32,334
Give it! Give it back!

473
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:41,199
You play so dirty?

474
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:42,659
What!

475
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:44,936
We'll get at least 3,000 for her.

476
00:56:45,249 --> 00:56:47,777
<i>If you just listen to us, we'll
send you to a good place.</i>

477
00:56:49,378 --> 00:56:51,478
<i>If you just listen to us, we'll
send you to a good place.</i>

478
00:56:59,032 --> 00:57:00,401
GU JUN PYO!

479
00:57:46,111 --> 00:57:49,165
Do you know Il Shim Hwe*?

480
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:49,166
{\a6}*Il Shim his mafia family name.
Hwe means an association or group.

481
00:57:50,104 --> 00:57:51,174
Then you're Prince Song?

482
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:52,362
Yeah!

483
00:57:57,681 --> 00:57:58,693
We're sorry.

484
00:57:58,694 --> 00:58:01,963
Please look past this.

485
00:58:01,964 --> 00:58:03,600
Get the hell away.

486
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,042
What happened?

487
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:22,960
We knew this was going to happen.

488
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:25,490
We thought you would be crying like this.

489
00:58:53,017 --> 00:58:55,738
Jun Pyo must really be busy.

490
00:58:56,536 --> 00:58:59,249
Even after I said we're here,
he can't change his schedule.

491
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:00,900
What's this?

492
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:03,460
You don't think he's matured
during this time?

493
00:59:03,991 --> 00:59:05,924
His father passed away.

494
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:08,921
<i>It was unavoidable for him to mature.</i>

495
00:59:08,922 --> 00:59:11,591
It suddenly feels so realistic and lonely.

496
00:59:11,592 --> 00:59:12,841
What does?

497
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:17,735
The reality that now he's not F4,
but the owner of Shinhwa group.

498
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:22,451
Jan Di, did you meet Jun Pyo yet?

499
00:59:22,735 --> 00:59:23,772
Huh?

500
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:27,255
No, I didn't.

501
00:59:28,253 --> 00:59:30,665
He looked like he was busy and hectic.

502
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,640
How could I meet him?

503
00:59:32,977 --> 00:59:36,021
How do you know if he
looked busy and hectic?

504
00:59:36,926 --> 00:59:38,955
<i>Ah, that.</i>

505
00:59:38,956 --> 00:59:42,038
I... I had a feeling.

506
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:44,707
He has to take care of this amazing place.

507
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,346
If he's not busy, that's just strange.

508
00:59:48,237 --> 00:59:50,424
I'm sure we'll meet him at one point.

509
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:53,245
So while we wait, do you want
to go relax our bodies?

510
00:59:53,246 --> 00:59:56,562
Okay! Let's go! Let's go!

511
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:05,162
The rest, Director Kim said
he'll post up the report.

512
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:06,629
When he posts up the report?

513
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:08,551
Yes, I will.

<i>You should take some time to
meet with your F4 friends.</i>

520
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:04,899
Do I look like I have nothing to do?

521
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,812
<i>Then should I just forget my
schedule and play with them?</i>

522
01:03:07,813 --> 01:03:09,510
<i>He has really changed.</i>

523
01:03:11,314 --> 01:03:12,562
Whatever it is,

524
01:03:12,563 --> 01:03:15,647
I came here to hear it directly from him.

525
01:03:15,897 --> 01:03:17,435
<i>I'll have to take to confront him.</i>

526
01:03:17,436 --> 01:03:19,713
Then you were being sincere?

527
01:03:20,032 --> 01:03:21,775
I was always a guy like this.

528
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:25,283
I just pretended that I wasn't.

529
01:03:25,881 --> 01:03:29,001
<i>Hey there, ugly lady,
please buy ice cream from me.</i>

530
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:31,621
<i>Give me your day today.</i>

531
01:03:31,622 --> 01:03:34,859
<i>Ji Hoo, you like that girl.</i>

532
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,889
What?

533
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:40,259
<i>Ji Hoo, when you look
at that girl, you smile.</i>

534
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,164
Get on.

535
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:41,896
What?

536
01:03:41,897 --> 01:03:44,501
I do a lot of things for the
first time because of you.

537
01:03:45,207 --> 01:03:48,213
<i>So... thanks.</i>
