Boys Before Flowers

00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,910
{\a6}Enjoy:)

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,390
Episode 20

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,560
This...

5
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,620
Ah, isn't that pretty?

6
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,340
It looked unique and not complicated,
so I thought I'd try making one too.

7
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,670
Where did you get this?

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,010
Why?

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,850
Tell me!
Where did you get this?

10
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,650
The teacher here...

11
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,910
Because to me, that friend was my kiln
and my spinning wheel.

12
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,560
Because that kid night cry,

13
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,500
I was afraid.

14
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,440
Like my father...

15
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,430
Like my mother...

16
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,410
Because that kid might cry
because of me,

17
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,810
I ran away.

18
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,990
I can't believe it...

19
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,980
Go away!

20
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,040
<i>Hey you, I saw it first.</i>

21
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,750
You should stop now, don't you think?

22
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,330
This...

23
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,860
Do you know what an insult this is
to that person?

24
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,570
Giving money to help someone
is an insult?

25
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,130
Guess you didn't think of it that way?

26
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,090
In all my life, it's the one wish
that I've truly wanted.

27
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,400
Just this once, couldn't you just
give in?

28
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,070
How?

29
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,940
How does a man like that become
your wish?

30
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,280
You're the heiress to Shinhwa Group.

31
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,410
You're in a position where the best men
in Korea, no in Asia, aren't good enough.

32
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,520
Come to your senses.

33
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,820
To me, that person is the best.

34
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,290
Because I love him, no one,
no matter who they are, can replace him!

35
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,960
Pathetic fool.

36
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,360
For sentiment that will disappear in a
few years, you'll gamble away your life?

37
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,440
That won't do.

38
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,490
Mom!

39
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,610
That's right! Because I'm your mother,
because you were born into Shinhwa Group,

40
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,950
I can't permit you to gamble on your
childish love.

41
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,490
Do something like that in your next life.

42
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,800
<i>Hey!</i>

43
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,770
<i>Miss!</i>

44
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,790
<i>Oh, this young lady!</i>

45
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,070
<i>What do we do?</i>

46
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,290
<i>Miss!</i>

47
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,180
<i>Miss!</i>

48
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,640
<i>Why is she like this?</i>

49
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,370
<i>Are you OK?</i>

50
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,980
<i>What should I do?</i>

51
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,650
Hello?

52
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,380
The thing is, the young lady has fainted.

53
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,260
<i>Here? We're at...</i>

54
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,940
Are you waking up?

55
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,100
How...?

56
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,820
It could have been really bad.

57
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,650
Jan Di, you fainted on the street.

58
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,350
But how did you...

59
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,340
If I hadn't called you at that moment,
what would you have done?

60
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,820
How can someone be so foolish?

61
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,790
If you had a problem, I told you
to think of me as a big sister.

62
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,360
Being sisters, did you think those were
empty words?

63
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,930
It's not that.

64
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,200
You made a mistake, right?

65
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,340
Then, from now on, you have to
listen to me.

66
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,650
From now on, Jan Di, you're my guest.

67
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,690
Until your parents return, you can't
ever leave this house. Understand?

68
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,030
Unni, that's a little...

69
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,530
Regardless of Jun Pyo, didn't you say
that you'd think of me as a real sister?

70
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,870
Um, still... Madam President...?

71
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,780
You don't need to worry about my mother.
For the time being, she's away on a trip.

72
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,610
So now, you don't have any other
excuses, right?

73
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,250
Then, despite my sense of shame,
I'll stay for a while.

74
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,220
That's right! You should've been like
this from the start.

75
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,820
But I too have one condition.

76
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,960
Condition?

77
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,480
I don't like to eat for free.*

78
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,480
{\a6}*meaning receive charity

79
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,530
To cover room and board here, let me
do some work.

80
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,320
What?!

81
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,850
No matter how much I think about it,
there's something I'm curious about.

82
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,980
What?

83
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,890
The reason why you're so good to me.

84
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,220
Honestly, it's a little odd.

85
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,520
Gu Jun Pyo is now engaged.

86
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,900
Also, being so good to me, if
Madam President came to know...

87
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,870
Are you really that curious about it?

88
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,370
Here, finished!

89
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,530
It's a present.

90
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,800
Starting today, this is the new
housemaid, Geum Jan Di.

91
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,970
She may be no different from my younger
sibling, but she insists on working here,

92
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,040
I expect all of you to help her out.

93
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,410
My name is Geum Jan Di.
Please kindly assist me.

94
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,830
There is no need to request assistance.

95
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,700
Grandma, please take good care of her.

96
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,140
If that one needs to request assistance,
then it may be better to not even start.

97
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,580
Oh, Grandma, a little gently. Hm?

98
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,330
No, it's fine. I will be diligent!

99
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,220
Please treat me the same as the others.

100
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
Diligent is not good enough.

101
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,610
Perfect. In this house, anything less
than perfect will not be tolerated.

102
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,230
Are you ready?

103
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:37,030
The answer is always "Yes", "I understand",
politely and in a moderate tone!

104
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,810
Yes... I understand.

105
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,280
Soon, I'll be going to the States.
Will you be OK by yourself?

106
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,120
Please don't worry about me.

107
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,050
You, newcomer!

108
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,690
What are you dreaming about,
you're not coming?

109
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,190
Yes, Grandmother.

110
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,860
"Grandmother", you say?

111
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,730
How can I be Miss Geum Jan Di's
grandmother?

112
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,740
Then, what should I call you?

113
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,610
Here, you and I are at our sacred
workplace. You call me "sunbae".

114
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,180
Sun... Sunbae?

115
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,720
How long are you going to blankly
stand there?

116
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,780
If you're to learn from the ground up,
even a minute is precious.

117
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,950
Quickly come along.

118
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,990
Uh... yes!

119
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,580
<i>In this house, a maid is not merely
a housekeeper.</i>

120
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:00,370
<i>She's a specialist who works to perfectly
match her employer's needs and be prepared.</i>

121
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,220
<i>Ironing a shirt's cuffs and sleeves
in one minute is a must.</i>

122
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,980
<i>From knowing how to dust an
expensive painting,</i>

123
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,920
<i>to knowing how to organize a wine list,
she must exercise perfect care.</i>

124
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,670
Chanbatin.

125
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,870
Chambertin.

126
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,710
<i>Now, this time, we shall go over the
dinner menu.</i>

127
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,910
<i>Shrimp carpaccio with white
truffle aïoli.</i>

128
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,000
Shrimp...carpa!

129
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,390
<i>Asparagus-garnished skirt steak.</i>

130
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,670
A...aspara..gan!

131
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,350
<i>Bell pepper chutney lined arugula, topped
with smoked duck.</i>

132
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,380
Duck?

133
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,780
I'm hungry. Give me some food first.

134
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,670
Basil oil drizzled...

135
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,440
Len...

136
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,560
L-le...

137
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,510
Lentil beans.

138
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,330
Lentil beans.

139
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,020
Oh, you scared me!

140
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,290
Grandma! You are still alive?

141
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,960
Yes. Regretfully, I could not yet
pass away.

142
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,450
I... no, what I meant was...

143
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,620
It's just that I haven't seen you
for a long time.

144
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,210
What happened?

145
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,570
Didn't you say that you were going to run
a housekeeping school or something?

146
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,610
The household was such a mess, I couldn't
sit back and watch, so I came back.

147
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,820
Butler Lee, in the meantime, will be at
the school on my behalf.

148
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,930
Why?

149
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,390
Do you have a problem with that?

150
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,760
N..no.

151
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,990
But who's she?
Is she your trainee?

152
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,670
Where did you find the idiot
who doesn't even know the menu?

153
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,200
An unavoidable situation arose so
I am helping her out.

154
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,750
Let me introduce you.

155
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,180
Please turn around.

156
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,570
Nice to meet you.

157
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,990
From now on, this is the person on whom
you will wait, Young Master Jun Pyo.

158
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,480
Please look kindly upon me.

159
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,260
Geu... Geum Jan Di!

160
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,140
Starting today, this is Young Master
Jun Pyo's personal maid, Geum Jan Di.

161
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,950
Personal... maid!

162
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,700
Please! I will do everything that
you tell me to do.

163
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,510
But what's this about Gu Jun Pyo's
personal maid...

164
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,840
"Gu Jun Pyo", you say?

165
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,030
In this house, there is no one who can
address him like that.

166
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,640
Whatever relationship you two may have
on the outside,

167
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,740
while you're working in this house,
address him as "Young Master".

168
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,540
Ah... yes. Yes.

169
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,010
So that's why, please reconsider my being
Young Master's personal maid.

170
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,120
Grandmother... Sunbae.

171
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,780
Please, I beg of you.

172
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,400
Did you forget already?

173
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,950
An employee cannot do only what
she wants to do.

174
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,230
As I expected, it wasn't right to come here.

175
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,690
Even now, could I say that I'm leaving?

176
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,290
<i>If you had a problem, I told you
to think of me as a big sister.</i>

177
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,160
Being sisters, did you think those
were empty words?

178
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,400
<i>Ah... Geum Jan Di! Gu Jun Pyo's
personal maid, Geum Jan Di, respond.</i>

179
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,430
Gu Jun Pyo?

180
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,730
<i>Yeah. Geum Jan Di, come to my room
immediately. Over.</i>

181
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,540
What?! This is really...

182
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,940
Hey!

183
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,780
What do you think you're doing right now?

184
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,920
It took you 3 minutes.

185
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,120
Next time, try to get here within
one minute.

186
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,330
What?!

187
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,530
This is really...

188
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,790
An order to Gu Jun Pyo's personal maid,
Geum Jan Di.

189
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,560
Immediately cook up some delicious ramen.

190
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,230
No!

191
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,740
Because of your sister, I can do nothing
but try to tolerate this.

192
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,860
Within 10 minutes, bring the ramen.

193
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,270
Transmission ended.

194
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,750
Gu Jun Pyo... do you really want to die?

195
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,190
To whom are you replying so carelessly
and informally?

196
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,420
I understand.

197
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,680
What is this?

198
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,250
Oh, you told... me to cook ramen for you.

199
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,740
But there's no lid!

200
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,780
Lid...

201
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,140
Are you satisfied now?

202
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,450
- Where are you going?
- Why... !

203
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,810
W..why?

204
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,340
Until I finish eating, sit over there.

205
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,700
There's a button. Push it.

206
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,340
Y...you! I mean, Young... Master.

207
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,780
What are you up to now?

208
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,310
The chair is so uncomfortable.

209
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,820
I'm in the process of testing it so just
do as I say.

210
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,340
<i>What time is it, you're still in bed?</i>

211
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,690
Quickly get ready and go to the
Young Master.

212
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,180
Excuse me?

213
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,760
Starting from the morning?

214
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,790
<i>Oh, this is a problem. He's being
difficult again.</i>

215
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,470
<i>If this keeps up, won't we all get fired?</i>

216
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,300
<i>Seriously.</i>

217
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,930
<i>- What should we do?
- I don't know.</i>

218
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,840
<i>You're not leaving?!</i>

219
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,080
<i>Know that if you wake me one more
time, you're fired! Got it?</i>

220
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,030
<i>Don't cry.</i>

221
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,020
<i>It'll be alright.</i>

222
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,180
<i>Don't cry.</i>

223
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,160
Young Master Jun Pyo, you should
get up now.

224
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,410
Didn't I say that if you wake me one more
time, then I'll fire you?

225
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,300
Do you want to die?

226
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,600
Gu Jun Pyo.

227
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,450
You're not gonna get up?

228
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,890
Because of you, people have to even fear
for their jobs? Get up!

229
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,800
Ah, what is this?!

230
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,790
Geum Jan Di.

231
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,220
I'll get up. If I get up, then
it'll be fine...

232
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,460
About being fired... I take it back.

233
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,600
Excuse me? Young Master, thank you!
Truly, thank you!

234
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,420
Now it's over, right?

235
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,510
- Jan Di!
- Thank you!

236
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,820
You're the best!

237
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,830
Is there anything you want to eat?

238
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,050
I'll make it all for you!

239
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,000
Yi Jung!

240
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,660
Why are you here?

241
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,320
I always did the hiding, and never had
to do the seeking.

242
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,800
Turned out to be pretty difficult.

243
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,070
Cha Eun Jae.

244
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,000
Didn't you hide a little too well?

245
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,980
I almost gave up playing hide and seek.

246
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,160
Yi Jung.

247
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,020
Why the hell nothing turns out well
for us?

248
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,390
What's worse? Your luck in working as your
ex-boyfriend's personal maid?

249
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:37,100
Or my luck, ultimately reuniting a guy
with his first love

250
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:40,700
after finally deciding to make an effort
with him.

251
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,200
Comparing such things is too sad.

252
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,100
Welco...

253
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,670
Jae Kyung unni!

254
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,940
Jan Di, did you move again?

255
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,750
Where happened to your house?
There's absolutely nothing left of it.

256
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,290
Oh, that... a situation kind of came up.

257
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,280
So where did you go?

258
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,400
Let's have another housewarming!

259
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,440
I'll buy something delicious to eat
and bring it.

260
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,760
Ga Eul, like the last time, we can play
the truth game again. Sounds good?

261
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
Where is it? Tell me.

262
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,970
The thing is, my situation is...

263
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,740
It's my house!

264
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,490
Huh?

265
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,960
Right now, she's sharing a room with me.

266
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,590
So we can't have a housewarming and we
can't even invite you over.

267
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,440
I'm sorry.

268
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,100
So it's like that. Still, it's a relief
that you're staying with Ga Eul.

269
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,680
You could have stayed with me also!

270
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,890
Thank you for saying that.

271
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,190
Oh, Ga Eul, pack up some porridge for me.

272
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,290
Porridge? Why?

273
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:46,010
After the trip, I couldn't see Jun so I
called, but he said that he was sick.

274
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,550
So I'm going to visit him.

275
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,260
Jun?

276
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,780
Wait, Gu Jun Pyo is sick?

277
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,310
This morning, he was...

278
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,800
Jan Di, isn't it time for you to
go volunteer?

279
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,170
I'm right, aren't I?

280
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,980
Oh, oh, it's over.

281
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,150
Well, his breathing sounds fine.

282
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,000
There is a bit of a fever but overall,
he's healthy.

283
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,010
Thank you!

284
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,240
Goodbye.

285
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,910
Take your mother's hand.

286
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,160
Goodbye!

287
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,820
Doctor!

288
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,240
Doct...

289
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,250
Grandfather!

290
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,970
Grandfather! Grandfather, are you OK?

291
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:08,380
Yes, I'm fine. I know my own disease.

292
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,050
Oh, there's no need to be afraid.

293
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,570
You're not fine.

294
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,240
What would you have done if I weren't
here, like last time?

295
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,220
You're right.

296
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,910
I can't let you keep living by yourself.

297
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,280
Are you saying you're going to put me
in a nursing home?

298
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,080
Yes.

299
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,230
This girl!

300
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,180
Sunbae!

301
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,340
What's up so suddenly?

302
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
What is all this?

303
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,220
They are stuff for moving.

304
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,750
By any chance.. are there any empty
rooms in here?

305
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,320
Hurry up! Hurry!

306
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,090
Wait a moment.

307
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,870
Hurry hurry!

308
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,470
Haha, I have no clue what you are up to.

309
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,300
How come my personal maid isn't here?

310
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,260
Hm?

311
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,020
Geum Ja...

312
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,280
My new personal maid.

313
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,100
Her master is having a dinner,
but how come she's nowhere here?

314
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,430
Your personal?

315
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,940
Today is a Saturday, Young Master.

316
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,270
So what?

317
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,440
So what?

318
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,650
Miss Jun Hee assigned Geum...

319
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,310
She planned the rookie maids' work hours,
so they would not interfere her school

320
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,610
and her part-time jobs.

321
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:40,100
Also only for five days per week.
That is why..

322
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Five days per week?

323
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,040
What kinda rule is that?!

324
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,300
She ain't working for the government.

325
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,120
Miss Jae Kyung has come.

326
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,610
What?

327
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,210
<i>Jun!</i>

328
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,080
Jun?

329
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,080
Our little Jun was sick? I will take
good care of you!

330
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,690
Let's eat porridge.

331
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,120
Jun Pyo, are you sick?

332
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,090
Here.

333
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,400
Ah~ Ah~

334
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,600
What are you doing Jun Pyo?

335
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,740
Your fiancée tells you to say ah~

336
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,240
<i>Oh my, you're eating well! Is it good?</i>

337
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,900
Sit down, please.

338
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,360
From now on, this is your house.

339
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,680
This girl!

340
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,790
How can things go so fast as lightening
at a time like this?

341
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,240
Listen. my feelings need to adjust...

342
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,590
You've been doing it for the
last 15 years.

343
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,670
Preparing your heart for this.

344
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,680
Do you need more?

345
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,220
From now on, if you don't listen to me,
I am going to let everything out!

346
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,290
What?

347
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,560
About your sickness, Grandfather.

348
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,530
Is it alright to do that?

349
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,460
You've learned all the bad things!

350
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,980
That's what someone else told me!

351
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,140
They said I'm good at covering distances.

352
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,710
Good night.

353
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,550
Hey, Jan Di.

354
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,550
Yeah?

355
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,520
Do you think he will forgive me?

356
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,220
What are you so afraid of?
You are his grandfather.

357
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,460
If he doesn't listen, you can just grab
 a stick and hit that boy in his cheeks.

358
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,500
Good night.

359
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,550
All right.

360
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,960
What do you think you're doing?

361
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,180
For grandpa, and Sunbae too,
you all need family.

362
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,050
All I did was find one for you.

363
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,310
Jandi, I am not yet...

364
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,230
You are not ready yet?

365
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,760
Because Grandpa said the same thing.

366
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,000
How long do you need to prepare
your hearts?

367
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:05,170
Aren't they all useless in the end?

368
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,270
You said before, Sunbae,

369
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:13,380
that no one can know everything about
one person.

370
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,950
But the person we know, at least we know
what kind of person he is.

371
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:31,390
The Ji Hoo sunbae I know, really loves
his grandfather.

372
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:37,230
That is the reason he can forgive him.

373
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,490
<i>Geum Jan Di.</i>

374
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,110
<i>Answer, Geum Jan Di.</i>

375
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,020
<i>Gu Jun Pyo's personal maid!</i>

376
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,700
<i>Did you fall dead somewhere?</i>

377
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,940
<i>You are still not home?</i>

378
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,280
WHAT?! I am not working right now!

379
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,880
<i>Run to me right now.</i>

380
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,610
Call me after 5a.m. on Monday.

381
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,240
<i>I'll pay you overtime then.</i>

382
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,970
What? Do you want ramen?

383
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,970
Hey!

384
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,610
Sit down here.

385
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,670
What? what?

386
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,010
Don't say anything and just sit.

387
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,810
What is this?

388
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,050
It's starting.

389
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,660
I'm leaving.

390
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,420
Geum Jan Di.

391
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,740
Hey! Gu Jun Pyo! We are in big trouble!

392
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,200
Jae Kyung unnie...

393
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,950
Jae Kyung unnie is coming right now!

394
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,000
What?

395
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,600
What are we gonna do? What do we do?

396
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,430
What do you mean what do we do?
Just be quiet.

397
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,230
You know what, we'll just stand up
and say the truth.

398
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,580
Ah, I dont know!

399
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,550
Where are you going?

400
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,450
Hey!

401
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,800
What are you doing?

402
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,180
Hey, why are you going in there?

403
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,430
Gu Jun Pyo, please close the door.

404
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,300
Hey, I'm asking why you're going in there.

405
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,570
<i>Jun, Jun!</i>

406
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,780
<i>Where are you?</i>

407
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,160
I'm here.

408
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,090
You were here!

409
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,090
Hey, monkey, don't you ever sleep? Why
come so late to someone else's home?

410
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,230
It's not someone else, but my partner.

411
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,460
What?

412
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,770
It's so corny, huh?

413
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,590
My father always say that there's
philosophies in every famous lyrics line.

414
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:13,790
Before, I had no clue what that meant,
but these days, I understand thoroughly.

415
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,210
Is it because I'm dating?

416
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,290
D-dating?

417
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,710
Why did you come anyway?

418
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,380
To spend the night together.

419
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,920
To spend the night?

420
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,660
We should watch this together.

421
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,560
I wanted to watch it but it was too scary
to watch alone.

422
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,920
Sounds good? Let's go.

423
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,230
I realized you liked these when you
were younger.

424
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,030
Let's eat.

425
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:29,300
I'm not hungry.

426
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:37,150
At least take this, then.

427
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,110
Unnie, what's going on...

428
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,270
Jan Di, why did you do it?
Why did you trick me?

429
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,240
I thought of you as my real friend.

430
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,440
I wanted to spend my life with you
as sisters.

431
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,500
But how can you do this to me?

432
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,550
Unnie...

433
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,980
That's not it. I'm sorry.. to be honest...
the thing is...

434
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:04,820
You lied to me, and you scarred me for
life that can never be removed.

435
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,660
Unnie... please calm down and listen...

436
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,510
<i>Jan Di, Jan Di, what are you doing today?</i>

437
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:35,390
I... I'm really busy today!
Really really busy!

438
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,720
In fact, I was just about to leave!

439
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,820
<i>Really? Alright, bye.</i>

440
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,540
Bye!

441
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,590
Both of you slept well?

442
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,860
So early in the morning...

443
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,030
What is up?

444
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,730
Oh me? I wanted to leave for work
with both of you!

445
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,750
Since it's three of us, let's take
the car.

446
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,770
Let's go! Let's go!

447
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:41,620
Hurry!

448
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:47,070
Here it is. Be careful, it is very hot.

449
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,030
Oh! Your temperature is normal.

450
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,840
Here you go.

451
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,610
Oh, Grandma! Grandma!

452
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:12,310
No!

453
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,720
Miss Kim Mi Ok!

454
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,810
Can you hold the baby for a second?

455
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,380
Oh, please wait a moment.

456
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:37,890
Sunbae!

457
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:40,980
Young man! Tea, please!

458
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,680
<i>Yeah, we need a refill.</i>

459
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,050
How can you be so good looking!

460
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,290
<i>I should drink some too then.</i>

461
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,250
Yes, it looks fine.

462
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,470
<i>You can leave this way.</i>

463
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,770
Wait just a second.

464
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,280
It's been long since I've been here.

465
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,440
Do you remember? That time we got scolded
by Grandfather because we were playing

466
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,740
hide-and-seek in the authentication room?

467
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,590
Of course! As a punishment, we had
to scrub the oven.

468
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,520
Right.

469
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,210
And the time you said it was cold,

470
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,690
so I started the fire and then it became
a disaster.

471
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,840
The one who complained
it was cold was you.

472
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,540
No way, it was obviously you.

473
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,020
Wait... was it me?

474
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,840
Your mother is doing all right?

475
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:03,780
Same as usual.

476
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,750
Want news about my father?

477
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,090
How about you, Yi Jung?

478
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,350
You're doing well, right?

479
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,260
Curious? Were you even curious
about that?

480
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,560
Why did you do that?

481
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:25,000
What?

482
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,940
How could you just vanish in the air
with no warning whatsoever.

483
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,610
Do you know that feeling?

484
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,940
Like air,

485
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,620
an existence that always stayed by my side
just disappears into thin air,

486
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,290
the bewilderment can't be
described in words.

487
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,560
If you knew, you couldn't have done
that do me

488
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,390
I was not your air.

489
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,500
What?

490
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:00,280
I wasn't the air, Yi Jung.

491
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:05,310
I was probably more like a wind, but you
mistaken me as the air.

492
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,800
I was also foolish enough to think
I was the air.

493
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,690
I thought I could stay there as long
as you wanted.

494
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:23,390
I don't understand what you're saying.

495
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:31,490
Winds can never return back to their
original place once they fly by.

496
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,850
Oh, it's you, Ga Eul.

497
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,920
I want to sleep so...

498
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,580
Can we get back later?

499
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:26,120
Sunbae, this is all you experienced
and endured,

500
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,120
and you acted so strong and mature in front of me?

501
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,490
Can you shut that mouth and leave?

502
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:42,600
No. If I shut my mouth now, I'll have to
see you live this stupid life forever.

503
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:51,580
Sunbae, you are a liar, a whiny, and
an absolute coward.

504
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,900
What?

505
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,510
You said you acted like you didn't know,
because you thought she would get hurt?

506
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,940
No.

507
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,590
You were just afraid of getting hurt
yourself, Sunbae.

508
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:06,400
Because you were scared for her to
realize you are pathetic.

509
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,230
Chu Ga Eul...

510
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:14,240
I know that So Yi Jung's mighty and cool
side is just a mask.

511
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:24,580
But the So Yi Jung I like is like a child
that is scared to loose love.

512
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,950
Children never hesitate in front of
something they like.

513
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:05,480
They know that if they lose it,
their tears will burst.

514
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,260
Thank you for today.

515
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:36,380
You did something you've never done
because of me, right?

516
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,190
Get in, I'll give you a ride.

517
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,590
No, it's fine. Ill go by myself.

518
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,640
Oh Grandfather, that must be very heavy.

519
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,220
Shall we go, Doctor?

520
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:13,670
Outside the hospital, I shall return
back to old grandpa again.

521
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:16,930
- Be careful.
- All right.

522
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,840
Put on your seat belt.

523
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,480
Drive carefully.

524
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:42,870
Be careful on your way home!

525
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,790
Young Master.

526
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,390
Young Master.

527
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,670
Young Master.
You have to get up, Young Master.

528
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,920
You should wake up now.

529
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,080
Young Master!

530
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,760
Young Master!

531
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,290
What do you think you're doing?

532
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,180
5 minutes.

533
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,830
Let me stay like this for just 5 minutes.

534
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:11,670
Even though I'm holding you like this,
I can't believe that you're here.

535
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,950
<i>Jun! I'm here! Let's...</i>

543
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,420
How do I look?

544
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,090
Jan Di... I can't let her go.

545
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:04,960
<i>By any chance, you are not going to ask me</i>

546
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,060
to help you run away from the wedding
tomorrow, right?

547
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,160
Gu Jun Pyo.

548
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,510
I am asking the point of your limit.

549
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,130
And how much do I need to deal with?

550
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,040
All of it.

551
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,080
I will repay everything that made
you suffer, Jan Di.

552
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,640
Please forgive me.

553
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,720
Break my arm.

554
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,570
What?

555
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:26,530
Jun Pyo.

556
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:30,080
If this is the only way you can stop
this, then just do it.

557
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,810
We're going to become a couple tomorrow
at this very place.

558
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:35,900
Regardless of our past,

559
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:40,800
we are going to promise to love
one another until our deaths.
