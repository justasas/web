1
00:00:00,772 --> 00:00:02,536
Why didn't you fight back?

2
00:00:02,537 --> 00:00:03,814
Isn't it obvious?

3
00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:05,911
Because I love you...

4
00:00:07,777 --> 00:00:08,939
I love you...

5
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:14,127
Isn't it the same with you? Your faces were all bought by money!

6
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:16,375
Buying beauty with money..

7
00:00:16,842 --> 00:00:18,313
What's wrong with that?

8
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:20,632
I'm sorry..

9
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:21,891
Awesome!

10
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,955
As expected of my pot-bellied woman, right?  (taikobara)

11
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:25,204
Pot-bellied?

12
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:27,477
I'm home!

13
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:32,994
I'm home.

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,923
Rui.

15
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:43,372
He looks exactly like Rui.

16
00:00:44,672 --> 00:00:45,324
I'm the real one.

17
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,324
Ah, the real one, huh?

18
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:48,382
Eh?

19
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:50,916
No way.

20
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,888
This can't be true.

21
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:52,873
Rui-san.

22
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,377
It looks like him.

23
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:55,181
They just said that.

24
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,989
You should've at least contacted us.

25
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:58,212
I thought I'd surprise you.

26
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:01,240
It's been awhile.

27
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:02,626
Eh?

28
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:04,858
Ah, yeah.

29
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:07,543
Doing fine?

30
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:10,050
Ah, mm.

31
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,554
Hhmm, looks like someone's blushing.

32
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,242
I'm doing fine, too, Rui!

33
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:07,363
Doing fine?

34
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:12,939
Hhmm.. Looks like someone's blushing.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,292
I'm doing fine, too, Rui!

36
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:16,292
Super Fine!

37
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,141
But you're all bruised up.

38
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:19,414
Why, what happened?

39
00:01:20,404 --> 00:01:22,191
Yup, that was it, Rui.

40
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:23,212
Good that you've noticed!

41
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:24,343
Anyone would've noticed.

42
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,717
You'll be so surprised with my Dog News!

43
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:27,070
Dog?  Isn't it big?

44
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,444
Why, what's up?

45
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:29,141
The truth is,

46
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:30,320
Right now.

47
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,868
Makino and I are going out.

48
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:33,595
Eh?

49
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,272
Hmph, don't joke too much.

50
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:40,686
The one who's trying to get attention is that little girl.

51
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:43,333
Whichever way it may be, Tsukasa-bocchan will... (bocchan - young master)

52
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:45,222
We're going back to Japan.

53
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:45,858
Hai.

54
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:47,727
We're leaving by my jet plane immediately.

55
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:49,070
Understood, Executive director.

56
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,898
Well, these wounds are our

57
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,757
proof of love, you might say...

58
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:57,180
Um, no, we're not going out yet or anything...

59
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:58,271
That's awesome!

60
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,894
Eh?

61
00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:02,717
No. If it's good or not, it's quite a difficult question. Or for me

62
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,202
it's a Nigashibu Choice (wrong grammar)

63
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,096
Use either Nigai or Shibui or Kujuu. (all means bitter)

64
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,335
Kujuu?

65
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,735
Are you trying to say Kujuukuri beach?

66
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:14,339
Then,

67
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:15,636
Let's celebrate at least.

68
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:16,313
You're right!

69
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,151
It's been awhile since the four of us have been together.
So let's PARTY!

70
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,898
The F4's together again.

71
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:21,927
Yeah.

72
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,808
You..

73
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,210
Why are you worse than a stupid turtle?

74
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,282
Coz' you're stupid after all.

75
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:29,797
Go and take your classes..

76
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,360
Although, I don't want to be told, by YOU.

77
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:34,234
Then, see you later.

78
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:42,946
Why don't you girls go, too?

79
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:43,393
Eh?

80
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,181
Are you sure?

81
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:45,898
We'll go..

82
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,191
It's like a dream!

83
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,131
No way..

84
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:52,000
We were the only ones invited!

85
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,000
You must be kidding.

86
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,525
No way, Domyouji-sama's joke is too intense.

87
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,353
It's not a joke, ugly!

88
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:00,787
Yuriko!

89
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:01,785
By the way,

90
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:07,147
Here.

91
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:10,545
Take it.

92
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,969
Wow, this is something.

93
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,390
So I can always reach you.

94
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:23,514
He's totally acting like my boyfriend already.

95
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:27,271
He's totally ignoring my feelings.

96
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,201
Could it be, you're confused?

97
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:30,734
Huh?

98
00:03:31,343 --> 00:03:32,898
Because the bead-eyed prince has returned.

99
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,212
I'm home!

100
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,020
Wha-..

101
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:41,030
What's this?

102
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:44,787
Next then!

103
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,343
Nure tede awa! (easy profit)

104
00:03:46,343 --> 00:03:48,909
That will surely be on the next exam!

105
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:49,565
I know!

106
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,191
When you're washing your hand (te),
it will be filled with bubbles (awa) and your hand
will become itchy! (nure te de - wet hand)

107
00:03:55,191 --> 00:04:00,545
Okay, for that, use a rubber glove
and your hand will still be okay even from bubbles!

108
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:02,363
Umm..

109
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:03,868
Then the correct answer is?

110
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,262
Having lots of return with very little effort,
is what Nure Tede Awa means.

111
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:10,595
Oh I see.

112
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:11,262
Umm..

113
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:15,484
Then us having all these expensive looking furniture added to us..

114
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:15,858
Eh?

115
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,858
Nure Tede Awa.

116
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:20,242
Ah, welcome home, Tsukushi!

117
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,646
Took awhile to notice.

118
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,191
Wait, don't tell me, all these..

119
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,191
were sent by..

120
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,646
Domyouji-san!

121
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,939
What was that baka (idiot) thinking?

122
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,464
What do you mean by Baka?

123
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,050
You should be thankful!

124
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,676
Thankful? We won't be able to live properly this way.

125
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:41,030
Well, from the very beginning..

126
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,080
We were never living a proper life.

127
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:46,454
I know, but..

128
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:48,363
No, that's not what I mean..

129
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:50,737
With this we won't be able to step around.

130
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:51,313
Oh yeah.

131
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:57,454
Well, Papa thought about this.
Why don't we sell everything to the recycle shop?

132
00:04:57,787 --> 00:04:57,979
Huh?

133
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:02,474
Papa lost almost all of our money in the horse race.

134
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:03,555
Huh?

135
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:05,979
This is not a manga, you know.

136
00:05:07,353 --> 00:05:08,504
Yeah, not a manga.

137
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,161
I bet everything on Take, hoping to get a big comeback,
so I can feed you guys something delicious.
(Take: horse's name)

138
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:17,323
But Take Yutaka.

139
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:32,011
Ebisu's "Ao Yuzu", go there.

140
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:37,151
Not "Go there!", okay?
What were you thinking with sending all of these furniture?

141
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,939
Ah, it was delivered already.

142
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,838
Those were super top of the line, so use them with care.

143
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:43,303
How are we going to use this?

144
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,252
You KNEW our house was small, right?

145
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,303
Stop talking nonsense, and just come!

146
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:50,686
Ah, wai-

147
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:55,635
My God, we're in the middle of a problem.

148
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,020
You're LATE!

149
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,939
Don't tell me, this is Tsukasa's girlfriend?

150
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:09,454
Eh?

151
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:11,404
You can say that.

152
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:14,909
You're joking, right?

153
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,909
Why this pathetic looking woman?

154
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,616
Impossible, this practically no-style girl?

155
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:22,252
Shut it, you old ladies!

156
00:06:22,252 --> 00:06:23,090
None of your business, right?

157
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:24,030
Huh?

158
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:27,454
Well said, Makino!

159
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:31,353
It's none of your business, and that's how it is,
that's why get out of here, uglies!

160
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:33,181
Ugly?

161
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,414
What, ugly?

162
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:38,444
Wai-

163
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:38,878
Sit!

164
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:45,272
Umm, with that, can you just take everything back?

165
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,414
What are you saying?

166
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:50,846
What's wrong?

167
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:52,683
Quarreling again?

168
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:54,451
Then, why don't you guys too-

169
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:56,985
Eh?

170
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:05,372
No way, kiss me, too!

171
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:07,818
Okay, okay.

172
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,605
Mrs. Tsubaki.

173
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:18,606
Yes?

174
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:23,087
It seems like Mrs. Kaede is going back to Japan.

175
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:24,429
Really?

176
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,666
I'm afraid it has something to do with Mr. Tsukasa.

177
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,964
Oh, well.

178
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:33,556
She's finally starting to make her move, huh?

179
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,978
With this, it's genuinely my turn now, huh?

180
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:46,026
Impossible.

181
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:50,495
For Hanazawa Rui to do something like that.

182
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,849
Totally Impossible.

183
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,424
It's no good.

184
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,382
I won't be able to look at him properly.

185
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:21,090
Haa!!

186
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:23,429
Good Morning.

187
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:26,858
'morning...

188
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:29,775
This..

189
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:32,593
Huh?

190
00:08:32,593 --> 00:08:33,753
That..

191
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,827
Seems like you're dripping..

192
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:39,863
Could it be, from that time?

193
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,998
Sorry for returning it so late.

194
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:47,518
You were holding onto it for so long..

195
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:55,028
It seems like you've changed. Aura maybe?

196
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:57,269
Really?

197
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,150
In France, did something happen with Shizuka-san?

198
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,124
Makino,

199
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:07,324
Yes..?

200
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,167
Will you go out with me?

201
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:13,315
Yes..

202
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,157
Eh!!

203
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:25,724

What do you mean by this?

214
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,915
But, I want to go to school.

215
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:35,454
Answer my questions.

216
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:37,779
Even you can neglect work

217
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,431
And worry about your son?

218
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:44,715
Unfortunately, I'm more worried about

219
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:46,911
the company than you.

220
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:49,531
If I was to go out with Makino,

221
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:52,410
How in the world will that affect the company?

222
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,969
Are you really going out with Tsukasa?

223
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,507
Uh, no.. that is..

224
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:00,436
That guy just said it on his own.

225
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:01,675
You see?

226
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:07,335
The truth is, I've always been aiming for you, Makino.

227
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,693
Dissatisfied with me?

228
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,525
Uh, no..

229
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:18,012
Forget about that Tsukasa.

230
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:19,924
Go out with me.

231
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,809
I've fallen for Makino Tsukushi.

232
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:29,721
Is there a problem with that?

233
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:32,798
Chairman of the Domyouji Zaibatsu?

234
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:35,276
I don't care if you're just playing around.

235
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:42,168
If you're just PLAYING AROUND with that commoner girl,
I couldn't care less.

236
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:44,159
I'm not playing around!

237
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:51,572
Unfortunately, I don't remember being raised,

238
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,129
by someone who jokes under this circumstance.

239
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:55,918
O-bocchama! (young master)

240
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:56,991
Out of my way!!

241
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:10,262
It was a joke, a joke.

242
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:11,124
Eh?

243
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,843
Tsukasa is my friend, you know.

244
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,043
Of course it'll bad, right?

245
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:19,094
Being all serious,

246
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:20,977
You're an interesting person.

247
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:24,596
The worst!

248
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,246
Huh?

249
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,978
Could it be you're dissappointed?

250
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:29,511
Not really, I wasn't..

251
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:30,819
Then,

252
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,872
Wanna secretly go out with me?

253
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,384
Eh?

254
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,253
That was a joke, too, right?

255
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:49,860
Ah, that's so funny.

256
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:55,405
Then, I've properly returned the handkerchief, okay?

257
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,253
Oh yeah,

258
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:04,251
Makino,

259
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:06,605
You've become much cuter than before.

260
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:08,858
Yeah.

261
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:11,315
Thanks.

262
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:19,278
What was that?

263
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:23,153
What in the world was that?

264
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:26,628
What happened to you?
Hanazawa Rui.

265
00:14:28,272 --> 00:14:30,010
Tsukushi-chan.

266
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,731
I would like to talk to you..

267
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:37,512
About what happened before, I'm really sorry.

268
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:41,492
And,
thank you very much.

269
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,377
After doing all those awful things to you,
and still protecting me.

270
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:48,456
I was so unbelievably happy.
-  What's wrong with that?

271
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,316
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:54,438
After transferring here, I've always been with Tsukushi-chan.

273
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:57,087
That "weed power"..

274
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:00,839
with it's power and honesty..

275
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:03,947
it seems that I've gotten a complex out of it.

276
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:05,653
It's not like that has anything to do with...

277
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:08,442
Exactly,
"It's not like that has anything to do with it."

278
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:09,599
Eh?

279
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:10,852
That's why, I will,

280
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,717
not give up on Domyouji-san!

281
00:15:12,717 --> 00:15:13,501
Huh?

282
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:15,015
Domyouji-san is after all,

283
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,249
a person that I've admired since I was young.

284
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,498
You see, formerly I was really ugly,

285
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,917
But right now, I've become this cute!

286
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,656
There's no reason why anyone will think that I'm inferior to Tsukushi-chan. Get it?

287
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:28,467
Not at all.

288
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,649
That's how it is, from now on "yoroshiku" (regards)

289
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,619
She's too unyielding!

290
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:47,520
Your furnitures,
I've taken it back to my place.

291
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,332
Thanks.

292
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:51,948
If you ever need it, just let me know. 'kay?

293
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:55,190
We probably won't need it in this lifetime.

294
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,148
Huh?

295
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:58,719
Uh, no, it's nothing.

296
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:00,874
Oh and yeah.

297
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:03,463
Investigate the background of this Makino Tsukushi and her family.

298
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,079
Understood.

299
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:10,339
If you feel like there's something strange around you, contact me immediately.

300
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:13,049
Something strange?

301
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:17,162
Okay? Do you understand?
Contact me immediately.

302
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:20,875
Tsubaki-sama.

303
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,462
It's been awhile, Okaa-sama (Mother, respectful)

304
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:33,245
May you please approve of the relationship
between Tsukasa and her?

305
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:37,149
Just to say that,
you came back all the way to Japan?

306
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,004
I don't want my precious little brother,

307
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:43,156
to feel the same heart-breaking experience I had.

308
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:46,839
Be careful with your mouth.

309
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:51,334
Your convenient and comfortable happiness,

310
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,334
For who's sake do you think it is?

311
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:59,386
With what I did, was there something wrong with it?

312
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,554
Whether or not there was something wrong with it,

313
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,056
I lost something.

314
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,749
Something like that..

315
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:08,457
In life, it is not enough to just have that, right?

316
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,145
It's true that I'm satisfied with my current life.

317
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,175
Then.

318
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:17,503
don't let your words come in between this.

319
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,313
You're someone who has left the Domyouji family, after all.

320
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:21,663
But I still remember after all..

321
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,131
How vulgar!

322
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,706
A married person,

323
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:28,729
should not be talking in such a vulgar way.

324
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,993
Okaa-sama,

325
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:32,679
Are you saying that it's vulgar

326
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,636
to seriously love somebody?

327
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,547
Seriously love?

328
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:43,382
An unknown feeling like that,

329
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:47,749
will have no merit whatsoever towards the Domyouji Group.

330
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:52,109
It became quite a dangerous atmosphere, huh?

331
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,485
You see?

332
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:55,231
It'll be bad if something happens,

333
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:58,199
that's why he drove me all the way here.

334
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,234
Seriously?

335
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:02,720
But doesn't that show how serious he is for you?

336
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,147
Okami-san. (landlady/owner/manager)

337
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,402
One time, there was a man whom I loved.

338
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,960
He was a dangerous yakuza man...

339
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,031
That usual pattern has started.

340
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:14,353
In the first place, he was a man from a Dango Ya. (ya - store)

341
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:18,019
That's why I, too, have started a Dango Ya.

342
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:21,374
He's a person who collects loans, and cheats people off,

343
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:23,224
with a face that looks like a geta (wooden clogs)

344
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:24,471
Could it be, it's..

345
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,655
Born and bred?

346
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:27,960
Katsushita Shibamata
(google this to understand what's going on)

347
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,551
It's Tora-san! (It was a show)

348
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,964
He's a wilful, selfish and clumsy man.

349
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:38,785
but he was serious towards the woman he loved.

350
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:42,206
I think about jumping into his arms.

351
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:45,947
I can imagine just how happy I can be.

352
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,126
Which Madonna is Okami-san?

353
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:51,337
Umm, I don't think she came out.

354
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:56,174
He's obviously a fool, but he was trying to be cool.

355
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:58,132
Plus that guy,

356
00:18:58,132 --> 00:19:01,151
had an incredible Sister Complex.

357
00:19:02,802 --> 00:19:06,863
Come to think of it, the situation is kinda like Domyouji.

358
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:10,928
But you know what,
What Kami-san is saying might have a reason.

359
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:11,773
Eh?

360
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:14,829
How about you jump into Domyouji-san's arms with all your strength?

361
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:17,754
Uh, jumping into his arms is..

362
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:20,771
Or could it be, you're concerned about your bead-eyed Prince?

363
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,002
Wanna secretly go out with me?

364
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:26,199
Uh, no..

365
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,571
You know what, Yuuki..

366
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:30,545
Wow, what a gorgeous person.

367
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:31,122
What?

368
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:32,350
Akira-kun.

369
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,038
Akira-kun came here?

370
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,041
Onee-san.

371
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:43,843
It's been awhile,
Yomogi-chan. (weed)

372
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:47,625
It's Tsukushi.

373
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:52,861
I shouldn't be saying this as her daughter..
But my mother is

374
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:56,235
a bit harsh, or should I say, she has a cruel side.

375
00:19:57,218 --> 00:19:58,671
Aren't you gonna eat?

376
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,779
Oh.. Yes

377
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,809
In order for things to go her way,

378
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,668
she doesn't care about the means at all.

379
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:10,267
That's why Domyouji said those things.

380
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,739
Tsukasa

381
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:15,250
seems to be really serious about you.

382
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,062
See, I told you.

383
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:20,350
just jump into his arms.

384
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:21,587
But.

385
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,873
If you can't answer Tsukasa's feelings, don't push yourself.

386
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:26,996
But if there's even a bit of a chance,

387
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:29,929
I will fully support the both of you.

388
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:34,054
Tsukasa has somehow changed, you know.

389
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,737
He became honest,

390
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:39,110
or should I say more mature..

391
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,379
I think that's because of Tsukushi-chan.

392
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:49,884
But I won't be able to compare to rich people.

393
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:51,620
I'm just a poor commoner.

394
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,387
But if Domyouji-san is really serious, he'll adjust to our ways.

395
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,867
I know!

396
00:20:56,867 --> 00:21:00,830
Yuuki-chan, right?
Do you have a boyfriend?

397
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,499
I do. He's tall and..

398
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:05,334
Then why don't we test if he'll be able to

399
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,517
adjust to Tsukushi's ways.

400
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:13,499
I quit, I quit.  It's boring!!!

401
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:15,638
Crushing defeat for Tsukasa!!

402
00:21:15,638 --> 00:21:16,945
When I'm playing Mahjong,

403
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:17,860
"ki ga ki ga ja ne" (the air is not the air)

404
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,255
"Ki ga shirenai" (Can't understand the atmosphere)

405
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:20,261
Shut it!

406
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:24,226
100, 200, 300..

407
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:26,507
What?!

408
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:29,981
Ah..

409
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,293
Rui, you're actually winning.

410
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:32,871
It's been awhile. (since his last win)

411
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,824
You must be kidding, baka!

412
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,034
Who was that?

413
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,345
Ok, let's play!

414
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:39,966
The fight is from here on!

415
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,286
You still want to play?

416
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:42,171
I will.

417
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:43,296
It'll be better if you stop.

418
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,062
If I say I'm playing, I'm playing!

419
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:47,337
I won't let you run away with the win!

420
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:49,602
What's up with the sudden good mood?

421
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:51,022
That call was Makino, right?

422
00:21:51,022 --> 00:21:52,422
That baka said,

423
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,369
"Tomorrow, let's go on a double date."

424
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:55,746
Double Date?

425
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:58,723
"Is it possible for us to go on a commoner's date?"

426
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,171
As if I'd go.

427
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:01,876
That's why you're in a good mood!

428
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:03,329
Isn't that great, Tsukasa.

429
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,747
Not at all!

430
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:08,733
Can the heaven given, Domyouji Tsukasa-sama

431
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:13,253
ever go to something as childish as a double date?

432
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:16,010
That's why calmly declined!

433
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,131
Then why are you in a good mood?

434
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:22,436
We're supposed to meet in front of Ueno's Saigo-san.

435
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:25,074
No way that's possible!

436
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:27,672
Then, is it okay if I go?

437
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:29,026
Eh?

438
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,980
Uh, no, because,

439
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,735
it's THAT, you know?

440
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:37,976
We're supposed to meet in front of Ueno's Saigo-san.
(Saigo is a political figure, 1827 - 1877)

441
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,066
What should I do?

442
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,764
Tomorrow, Hanazawa Rui's going.

443
00:22:41,764 --> 00:22:44,440
What's up with that?
How about Domyouji-sama?

444
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:46,524
It was impossible after all.

445
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:48,913
For him to adjust to our lifestyle.

446
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:51,604
You might be happy that your prince is coming,

447
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,130
But then what's the point?

448
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:57,085
Yuuki, sorry.

449
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,002
I have to hang up.

450
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,451
I'll call you back okay? Sorry.

451
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:03,785
Hello.

452
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:05,574
It's me.

453
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:07,084
Hanazawa Rui.

454
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:08,073
Eh?

455
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,306
Right now, I'm downstairs.

456
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,175
Huh??

457
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,325
Good evening.

458
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:24,316
Tomorrow, Tsukasa will probably go.

459
00:23:25,581 --> 00:23:27,722
He'll probably contact you.

460
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:31,074
That's all.
See ya.

461
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,865
Ummm...

462
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:44,435
Did something happen?

463
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:50,266
Ever since you came back from France, you've been a little strange.

464
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:53,719
Is that so..

465
00:23:56,517 --> 00:24:00,566
Did something happen over there?

466
00:24:02,705 --> 00:24:05,442
Everyday was a day full of happiness..

467
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:11,569
Everyday, the two of us cooked food
that we weren't accustomed to,

468
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:14,578
At night we barely sleep and just talk about our childhood days.

469
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,588
Ah, we also talked a lot about you, Makino.

470
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:20,909
About me?

471
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:23,175
Shizuka

472
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:26,339
says that she really liked you, Makino.

473
00:24:29,124 --> 00:24:30,866
But,

474
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:34,049
those days didn't last very long.

475
00:24:36,797 --> 00:24:39,709
Shizuka became very busy.

476
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:41,422
I was left all alone.

477
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:46,138
I wasn't able to do anything for her sake.

478
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:51,440
I remember the first time you fought back against Tsukasa.

479
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:55,996
A brat like you who has never earned what you have,

480
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,149
Don't be so full of yourself!

481
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:01,406
I thought, that really was the case.

482
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:04,332
I..

483
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,843
can't do anything for the person I love.

484
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:14,929
Ah, I wonder why I'm telling you all these things.

485
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:20,529
That's not true.

486
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:27,481
You're not a person who can't do anything.

487
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:29,358
In school,

488
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:33,121
when everybody was putting me through some tough times,

489
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:36,792
you.. saved me..

490
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:41,290
You became my only ally.

491
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:43,985
That's why, I..

492
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,707
for me, atleast.. I..

493
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:51,292
have been

494
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:54,178
saved by you, a lot, a lot of times.

495
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:59,853
The reason why I can be here right now..

496
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:02,563
Is because of Hanazawa Rui.

497
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,755
Makino.. I..

498
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,970
It's from Tsukasa, right?

499
00:26:18,548 --> 00:26:21,359
It's okay that I go to that commoner's double date.

500
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,291
That's all.

501
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,231
My God..

502
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:29,146
He said he's going tomorrow?

503
00:26:30,494 --> 00:26:31,503
Yeah.

504
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:34,352
That's all he said, then he hung up.

505
00:26:34,352 --> 00:26:36,842
My God, what's up with him?

506
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:38,243
Tsukushi!

507
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:39,714
Oh no!

508
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:45,326
I'm sorry.  Let's talk next time..

509
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,487
What were you doing, with this time?

510
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:51,609
Ah, sorry.

511
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,780
There was a cat.

512
00:26:52,881 --> 00:26:53,779
A cat?

513
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,073
A cat, huh?

514
00:27:17,466 --> 00:27:19,358
They're late..

515
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:23,388
Careless bastard..

516
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:26,585
Being just a commoner, and making the "Great Me" wait?

517
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:29,020
Don't lash out okay?

518
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,537
It's my precious best friend and her boyfriend, after all.

519
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:33,974
I know.

520
00:27:34,574 --> 00:27:35,990
Tsukushi!

521
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:38,127
Sorry for being late!

522
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:39,196
Hey.

523
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,033
Nice to meet you,

524
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,139
I'm Makino Tsukushi.

525
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,434
And this is, Domyouji-san.

526
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:47,804
Nice to meet you.
- What, what?

527
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:49,353
Your name is Domyouji?

528
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:51,835
Domyouji is..

529
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:54,050
It can be.  "Dou, myou ji?"
(What do you think about my last name?)

530
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,965
What a name to have!

531
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:57,725
Let's hurry up and go.

532
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,835
What in the world was that?

533
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:04,760
Let's go and have fun, have fun..

534
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,985
Being late and not even a proper greeting?

535
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,354
Man..

536
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,208
Where are we going?

537
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,618
Huh, didn't I mention it?

538
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:16,318
Ueno Zoo.

539
00:28:17,194 --> 00:28:18,925
Ueno Zoo?

540
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:27,295
Wow, it's been so long since I've gone to a zoo.
How 'bout you, Domyouji-kun?

541
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:29,024
It's my first time at a zoo.

542
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:30,310
Seriously?

543
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,861
So it's your first time seeing live animals?

544
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:34,728
Oh, you're afraid of animals!!

545
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:38,004
Ah, for me, my last time was during Junior High, right Yuuki?

546
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:38,582
Yeah.

547
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:41,030
If I want to see animals, I go to an African Savannah.

548
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,044
Ah, Savannah?

549
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:44,507
You're so lucky!

550
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:47,632
Could it be, that Domyouji-kun is an unbelievable obocchama-kun?

551
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,128
Obocchama-kun?

552
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:53,809
Hey, look at that, isn't it so cute?

553
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:57,233
Rather, doesn't his face look like Domyouji-kun's?

554
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,367
Hey you,

555
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:02,781
better be careful with your words.

556
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:07,044
Hotoke no kao mo, mitsu aru. (Even Buddha has 3 faces)
(It's supposed to be Hotoke no kao mo, san do. He read the kanji wrong.
It means "Don't try the patience of a Buddha")

557
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:08,159
Stupid!

558
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:11,323
What in the world was that?  I don't get it.

559
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:13,273
You're a funny person.

560
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,415
I'm sorry.

561
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:20,369
Wait a minute, Nakatsuka-kun.

562
00:29:22,118 --> 00:29:23,999
Those two look good together..

563
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:26,887
Is this what you call a commoner's date? Huh?!

564
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:29,063
What's up with that bastard?

565
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:32,101
Why are you getting yourself involved with that kind of trash?

566
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:33,859
That's just not possible!!

567
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,877
Sorry.

568
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:39,390
You're right, it's impossible...

569
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:45,648
I thought that someone who Yuuki will date, would be okay.

570
00:29:51,108 --> 00:29:53,557
Hmm, shall we go home, already?

571
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:56,632
If we go home right now,

572
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:58,853
wouldn't it be bad for the two of you?

573
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,088
Don't worry..

574
00:30:02,088 --> 00:30:03,908
I won't hit him..

575
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:06,070
But I'm extremely annoyed, okay?

576
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,062
Thank you.

577
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:14,247
Hey, hey!
Domyouji-kun, Domyouji-kun!

578
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:17,386
From here on, let's go separately!

579
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:18,601
Let us.
We will.

580
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:19,645
Let's do that!

581
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:21,569
Rather, that's what we'll do!

582
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:27,712
Huh, where's the cellphone I gave you?

583
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:29,772
Ah, that...

584
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:33,164
Today, I left it at home..

585
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,177
I see.

586
00:30:34,177 --> 00:30:38,501
By the way, when I called last night, were you alone?

587
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,699
It's that late, you know..

588
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:42,683
I'm alone, obviously.

589
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,785
I see..

590
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:47,518
Hey, wait!

591
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:54,470
You wanted this, right? Take it.

592
00:30:58,074 --> 00:30:59,505
Isn't it cute?

593
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:04,148
Bimyou~ (unclear, weird or strange)

594
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:08,056
Ah it's so cute!

595
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:12,190
Lesson Panda!

596
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,643
Huh?

597
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:15,255
It's Lesser Panda (also called Red Panda)

598
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:16,109
Huh?

599
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:17,850
It's Lesson Panda!

600
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:22,302
He's a real baka..

601
00:31:22,302 --> 00:31:24,216
You're the baka one...

602
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:27,002
But you know,

603
00:31:27,002 --> 00:31:28,633
Us going on a date like this..

604
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:31,524
It feels like we're finally looking like a couple..

605
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,811
You know...

606
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,882
About that..

607
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:38,736
Don't worry.

608
00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:40,824
I'm not wrongly assuming..

609
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:42,307
Eh?

610
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,598
I was saying those kinds of things in front of Rui, but..

611
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:49,425
I haven't properly heard your feelings..

612
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,360
But..

613
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,510
When I said I love you, I really am serious.

614
00:31:58,504 --> 00:32:01,951
Until you've properly answered with your feelings..

615
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:03,486
I will be waiting...

616
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:12,499
Well, if you reject a perfect man, like the GREAT ME,
you will definitely regret it.

617
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:17,875
You know what they say, a fish that escapes will swim...
(He's trying to say that if you let go of an opportunity,
you'll never get it again.)

618
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:20,577
Wait a minute!

619
00:32:20,577 --> 00:32:23,698
Just now, was that a gag? (joke)
Or are you a truly stupid?

620
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:25,032
What?

621
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:26,324
Wait a minute.

622
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:27,908
Could it be, you're naturally that way?

623
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,347
Hey, wanna buy some drinks?

624
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:31,635
I'm kinda thirsty.

625
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:34,040
Okay, then I'll go buy some drinks for everyone.

626
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,628
Oi, Yuuki!

627
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,908
Makino!
-Yes?

628
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:49,643
I'm going to take a sh*t.

629
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:50,719
Go ahead.

630
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:58,487
I'm really sorry..

631
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,247
I'm getting quite scared..

632
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,144
he can snap anytime..

633
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:07,279
He's usually not like that...

634
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,610
Rather,

635
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,527
I don't think he meant anything bad with that..

636
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:12,674
Eh? With that?

637
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:13,541
That attitude?

638
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,220
Look, it's like,

639
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,372
he's trying to make sure there are no walls between them.

640
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:20,012
If the people at Eitoku hears that kind of words towards Domyouji,

641
00:33:20,012 --> 00:33:22,918
it's instant death, INSTANT DEATH!

642
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:26,141
Domyouji-kun, wait a minute.

643
00:33:26,141 --> 00:33:29,240
Just now, I just received a call from a girl I know.

644
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,965
And because of that, wanna leave this place?

645
00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:33,132
Huh?

646
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:36,017
Well, cause I told them that I was with a really good looking guy.

647
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:38,234
They're bugging me saying
"I want to meet him! Let me meet him!"

648
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:40,542
I was thinking, but..

649
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:43,868
Domyouji-kun, could it be that you're pretty stupid?

650
00:33:49,717 --> 00:33:51,310
I wonder where they went?

651
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:55,348
They're a little late..

652
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:57,480
You know,

653
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,627
I AM going out with Yuuki, but..

654
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:02,786
It's honestly boring, or rather, bimyou..

655
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:05,074
I have no interest in whatever you're saying..

656
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:09,449
Don't try to act cool, and let's just leave this place.

657
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,231
Or rather,

658
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:15,111
isn't the girl with you, honestly a bimyou?

659
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,912
Makino is a bimyou?

660
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:22,875
That's why, I'm going to introduce you to a better woman.

661
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:27,591
Hey what was that about, you bastard!

662
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:29,871
What part of Makino is bimyou?

663
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:39,243
Her beautiful eyes are not deserving of this world, okay?

664
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:43,257
Hey, what are you doing?

665
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:49,727
Hey are you okay?
- I'm at my patience's limit already!

666
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:51,162
I'm going home!

667
00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:54,022
As for you, try to find a better man to date.

668
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:54,617
Wait!

669
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:56,190
Makino!!

670
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:59,962
Me being a part of your commoner's date,

671
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:01,590
will never happen again.

672
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:12,691
Did you do something to Domyouji-san?

673
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:14,075
Like that's possible.

674
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:16,377
What's up with that guy?

675
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,823
I just placed my hand on his shoulder..

676
00:35:18,823 --> 00:35:20,462
You just placed your hand on his shoulder?

677
00:35:20,462 --> 00:35:22,012
Yeah.

678
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:23,673
Isn't he a bit strange and crazy?

679
00:35:23,673 --> 00:35:24,762
Nakatsuka-kun.

680
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:26,874
Today, I made time for your sake you know!

681
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,334
Hey, do you understand?

682
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,603
Why do I have to be hit by him!

683
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,136
I'm very sorry.

684
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:36,591
I'm really very sorry.

685
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:37,912
Wait, where are you going?

686
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:39,773
I'm going home!!!

687
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:41,723
I'm so pissed, I can't take this anymore.

688
00:35:48,922 --> 00:35:50,832
I'm sorry, Yuuki..

689
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,203
It's not your fault at all, Tsukushi..

690
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:57,797
I'm sure Nakatsuka-kun did something..

691
00:35:57,797 --> 00:36:01,378
Even Domyouji-san wouldn't hit someone without a reason, right?

692
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,073
This kind of things hasn't happened lately, you know.

693
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:11,307
Today, Nakatsuka-kun has been saying some biting words..

694
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:15,835
I was kinda scared..

695
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,586
Ahh, shux..

696
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:24,656
I wonder if it's over..

697
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:25,756
between me and him..

698
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:49,117
If we go home right now,

699
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:51,106
wouldn't it be bad for the two of you?

700
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:54,352
Until you've properly answered with your feelings..

701
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:55,797
I will be waiting..

702
00:37:06,108 --> 00:37:09,401
Which side of him should I believe in...

703
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:12,752
Tsukushi! We have a problem!

704
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:23,966
What, in the end, you ended up fighting?

705
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:25,921
I didn't fight with Makino.

706
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:28,497
Ah, the double date was a failure, huh?

707
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:31,284
Anyway, why do you know that I was with Makino?

708
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:32,832
Tsukasa..

709
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,507
If you don't properly take a hold of her heart..

710
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,892
What happened to me, will happen to you..

711
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:39,842
Huh?

712
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:43,003
Do you know where your real enemy is?

713
00:37:43,854 --> 00:37:48,000
Being this late at night, sorry for visiting so suddenly.

714
00:37:51,927 --> 00:37:52,625
Nishida.

715
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:53,224
Yes.

716
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:54,467
Show THAT.

717
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,697
Steve, Vincent.

718
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,636
I'll be frank with you.

719
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,410
I have 300 Million right here.

720
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,017
300 Million?

721
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:13,822
With this, I would like Tsukushi-san to give Tsukasa up completely.

722
00:38:13,822 --> 00:38:14,819
Eh?

723
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:17,664
It may be discourteous,
but it seems that your family is financially in trouble.

724
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:19,465
Yes, we are greatly in trouble.

725
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:21,184
Papa!!

726
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,555
As you may know,

727
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:24,795
Tsukasa has a big future ahead of him..

728
00:38:24,795 --> 00:38:29,899
Right now, it'll be bad if he trips upon a small stone.

729
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,577
Please go ahead and accept this..

730
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,253
Don't tell me,

731
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:41,735
You won't be saying that you're seriously inlove, right?

732
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:44,009
If you're just playing around, then it's fine.

733
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:45,246
Our Chairman is trying to say that,

734
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:48,956
your daughter is the one who will get scarred.

735
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:56,026
Okusama? (Lady of the House)

736
00:38:57,306 --> 00:38:58,511
Okusama?

737
00:39:02,075 --> 00:39:03,212
What are you doing?

738
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:04,297
Mama!

739
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:07,244
Take your money, and please go home.

740
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:12,824
The feeling of a parent, who's child is being
insulted right in front of her.
Does a rich person like you not understand that?

741
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,391
Salty.

742
00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:26,213
This is really okay with you, right?

743
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:30,759
When you nameru a common person! It's salty!
(nameru: look down upon or lick)

744
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,798
Excuse me for coming, tonight!

745
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:39,464
Excuse us.

746
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:45,136
- Mama!!
- Mama!!

747
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:46,392
You okay?

748
00:39:47,274 --> 00:39:50,402
Mama, I've changed my opinion about you. Thank you.

749
00:39:50,402 --> 00:39:55,262
I don't know about your last line.
But I was really touched!

750
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:56,773
Tsukushi,

751
00:39:56,773 --> 00:40:00,054
Listen well.
- Yeah.

752
00:40:00,054 --> 00:40:03,635
Make sure you get along with Domyouji-san.

753
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:07,227
No matter what happens be with him..

754
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:10,647
Make sure you take a hold of the whole Domyouji Zaibatsu's fortune!

755
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:13,427
Don't be satisfied with just a stingy 300 Million!

756
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,560
That is why,

757
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,674
make sure that you and Domyouji-san will..

758
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,156
Mama!!

759
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:25,618
Just kidding!

760
00:40:25,618 --> 00:40:26,795
Let's eat our meal.

761
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:27,968
Uh..

762
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:29,858
Don't scare us like that.

763
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:48,423
Tomorrow, it's Yakiniku, ok? (bbq)

764
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,580
If you don't properly take a hold of her heart..

765
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,555
What happened to me, will happen to you..

766
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:10,339
Hey, help me!

767
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,464
Rui, what's wrong?

768
00:41:23,244 --> 00:41:24,518
Rui.

769
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,535
Why do you..

770
00:41:26,535 --> 00:41:28,658
Yesterday, I went to Makino's place.

771
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:30,450
Today, I left it at home..

772
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,509
It's that late, you know..

773
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:34,367
I'm alone, obviously.

774
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:39,121
When I called,

775
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,449
could it be, that you were together?

776
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:44,814
Yeah, we were together.

777
00:41:50,796 --> 00:41:52,462
What is going on?

778
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:58,506
Tsukasa, look at this.

779
00:42:13,937 --> 00:42:15,630
What do you want to talk about?

780
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:19,952
You know, I..

781
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,956
I can't be with you with such half-baked feelings.

782
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:31,747
Yesterday, properly explain what happened with you and Nakatsuka-kun.

783
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:34,560
By the way, you...
This..

784
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,758
You said you left it at home.

785
00:42:36,758 --> 00:42:38,164
Why do you have...

786
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,055
That's what I want to know!

787
00:42:40,055 --> 00:42:41,675
That doesn't matter.

788
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:43,960
Just answer my question.

789
00:42:44,716 --> 00:42:45,644
Doesn't matter?

790
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:48,796
The reason why you hit Nakatsuka-kun. Explain it to me!

791
00:42:50,353 --> 00:42:51,939
I don't want to say it.

792
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:53,853
So you're the type that hits people without reason?

793
00:42:53,853 --> 00:42:56,093
I was pissed off that's why I hit him, that's all!

794
00:42:56,093 --> 00:42:58,476
What in the world is that?

795
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:02,732
You're that kind of person after all..

796
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:05,255
You can ruin other people's happiness and still feel alright about it?

797
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:06,245
- Eh?

798
00:43:06,245 --> 00:43:07,850
They broke up already.

799
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,467
That's great.

800
00:43:11,514 --> 00:43:12,608
What are you doing?

801
00:43:12,608 --> 00:43:14,880
I was pissed off that's why I hit you!

802
00:43:16,268 --> 00:43:16,820
You know what..

803
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,269
Even if you're pissed, there are things that you can and can't do!

804
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:21,586
Yuuki is,

805
00:43:21,586 --> 00:43:23,377
feeling really sad because of you, you know!

806
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:25,739
She should be thankful the "Great Me".

807
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,830
Are you baka?

808
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:30,905
You really haven't changed.

809
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:32,762
Red-tagging people,

810
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:35,411
and then bullying them. You are the worst kind of person.

811
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:36,770
You're a human trash!

812
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:37,495
What?

813
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:39,773
I don't ever want to see your face again!

814
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:42,864
Hey wait!

815
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,955
Oh, and yeah..

816
00:43:46,813 --> 00:43:48,595
Yesterday,

817
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:50,754
Your mother came to our place.

818
00:43:52,126 --> 00:43:53,290
Eh?

819
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:56,584
Brought a great amount of money,

820
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:58,734
And asked me to give up on you..

821
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:05,732
Tell your mother..

822
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:09,321
That I will..

823
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:13,318
no longer have anything to do with you. So don't worry.

824
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:28,260
Domyouji is a

825
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,692
Domyouji is a
BAKA!!!!!

826
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:38,849
But, for trusting that guy even a little bit, I'm the baka one.

827
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:44,134
Yesterday, you two had a fight?

828
00:44:45,844 --> 00:44:47,290
Fight or not..

829
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:50,306
I no longer have anything to do with that guy.

830
00:44:51,646 --> 00:44:52,971
I see..

831
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:58,048
That guy..
He's the worst...

832
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,365
Wait...

833
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:07,028
I wonder, why I've

834
00:45:07,028 --> 00:45:10,685
never fallen inlove with you, Makino, until now..

835
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:15,684
Just a minute is fine..

836
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:17,596
Let me stay like this.

837
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:23,683
Did something happen?

838
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,792
Sorry..

839
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,720
Just let me stay like this..

840
00:46:01,578 --> 00:46:03,105
What's this?

841
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,141
So that's how it is?
