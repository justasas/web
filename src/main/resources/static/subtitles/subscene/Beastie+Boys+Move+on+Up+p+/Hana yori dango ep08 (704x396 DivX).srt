1
00:00:01,928 --> 00:00:05,881
Any guy who hurts Makino, will never get away from me.

2
00:00:06,862 --> 00:00:10,358
You should've said that way in the beginning.

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,359
Huh?

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,398
Domyouji Tower's Heliport.

5
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:14,399
Eh?

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,589
Come right now.

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,690
If you don't, I'll half-kill you..

8
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:20,177
Papa has been laid-off!

9
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:20,878
Eh?

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,079
WHY?!?!?

11
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,278
Papa..

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,316
What do you mean by this?

13
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:33,641
That's what I want to know..

14
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:38,398
Umm..  This is a company owned house, right, Papa?

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,540
Being laid off... Could it be?

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,531
They said we have to leave by Christmas..

17
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:45,432
Eh?

18
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:46,767
Isn't that too soon?

19
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:48,698
D*mnit..

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,570
I'm desperate for Sake!

21
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,150
Wai-

22
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,437
Papa!

23
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:54,438
Hey, calm down!

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,909
D*mnit.  This beer has nothing but air coming out... D*mnit!

25
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:03,791
You can just look for a new job, right?

26
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:07,747
That's right!  
Let's just look towards the future! This isn't like you, Papa!

27
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:08,925
Papa. Look!

28
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:13,165
Today is special!  
It's okay for you to drink a new one! It's not much, but..

29
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:15,166
Papa will do his best!

30
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,375
Papa will definitely do his best!

31
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:29,263
That witch.

32
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,202
Saturn Being?

33
00:01:35,203 --> 00:01:36,501
Eh, who's the Saturn Being?

34
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:37,496
Me and Makino.

35
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,467
Saturn.. The one with the rings, that Saturn?

36
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:40,513
I just told you that's the one!!

37
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:42,614
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, the dotted color Saturn!

38
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:44,634
What dotted color?

39
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:45,635
That's really funny!

40
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:47,905
Anyway!

41
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:51,178
Me and Makino are both Saturn beings, that's why,

42
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,588
From the very beginning we are destined to be together.

43
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:54,989
Is your brain okay?

44
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:59,603
And I thought I'd go to the trouble of showing her our 
Native Planet..

45
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:03,553
That peasant!  On top of ignoring me, she made me worry!

46
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:05,252
Umm, you know what, Tsukasa-kun.

47
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:08,111
We were born here on earth.. We're earthlings!!!

48
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:10,119
No one was born in Saturn you know...

49
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,440
Of course I know that!

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,107
Are you a baka (idiot)?

51
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:19,658
No way.. Just now..

52
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,871
Hanazawa Rui-san and my eyes met..

53
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,508
He's coming over..

54
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:24,970
Ooh, what should we do?

55
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,344
Hey!
- Hai (yes)!

56
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:28,651
Where's Makino?

57
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:30,806
Makino-san, she's absent it seems..

58
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:32,647
But I think she's just playing hooky~

59
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,411
Oh no!

60
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,045
Domyouji-san doing something like this!  I'm a little shocked!

61
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:39,774
Do what you want, ugly!!

62
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:41,683
Wait Tsukasa. Where are you going?

63
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:44,049
Makino didn't show up, so I'm going home!

64
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:46,013
Hai.

65
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,936
Is that so?

66
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,552
I understand.

67
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:51,082
Excuse me.

68
00:02:58,174 --> 00:02:59,491
Planet fortune telling?

69
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:01,247
Yeah, this one.

70
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,984
Oh, so that's how it is, huh?

71
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:04,036
It says here,

72
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:06,378
both Tsukasa and Makino are Saturn Beings..

73
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:09,257
And when you told Tsukasa about it..

74
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,745
He was super happy!

75
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,206
And that's why he thought he'd show Saturn to Makino!

76
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,091
But..

77
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:15,762
I wonder why Makino didn't come?

78
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,414
It seems like she didn't even call.

79
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:18,887
Should I call Yuuki-chan?

80
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:22,251
Hello, Yuuki-chan?

81
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:24,729
But you really like these kinds of things, Rui.

82
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:25,978
Eh?

83
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:26,989
Laid off?

84
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:27,914
Hai.

85
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:30,167
Her father has just been suddenly promoted,

86
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:33,311
and the whole family were really happy..

87
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:35,678
That aside, why do you look so happy?

88
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,465
Uh no..

89
00:03:37,865 --> 00:03:40,805
I thought I'd give Nishikado-san a call.. but..

90
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:45,156
I didn't have any courage after all.. I was feeling really down..

91
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:46,471
I didn't expect Nishikado-san to-

92
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:48,758
But, it's a real pity..

93
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:51,830
They were already that poor.. Then being laid-off..

94
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,629
After all, are you just playing me around, Nishikado-san?

95
00:03:58,202 --> 00:04:01,635
That's Tsukasa's mom's work, isn't it?

96
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,524
Umm..

97
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:06,527
The same thing happened with Tsukasa's Oneesan..

98
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:14,063
Recently,

99
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:16,721
it's been really rare..

100
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,202
Eating here at home..

101
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:25,904
Is that suppose to be me?

102
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:28,022
Or is it you?

103
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:35,130
When are you going back?

104
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:41,783
Just go back already.

105
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:47,041
When everything goes my way..  
I will immediately go back to New York.

106
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,529
When every piece falls into place.

107
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,623
5 million yen? (about $41,480)

108
00:04:57,623 --> 00:04:59,238
There must've been some mistake?

109
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:01,057
This is the loan proof, Ojou-san (young lady or daughter, honorable)

110
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,237
Please!!

111
00:05:02,237 --> 00:05:04,793
Can you just please wait a bit more?

112
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:08,060
Well, you've been laid-off, right Otochan (father)?

113
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,291
Huh?!

114
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,677
But, I'll find a job soon, and work hard..

115
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:14,379
Everyone is doing the same thing, stupid!

116
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,019
Even if you say "Find a job right now..".  It's..

117
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,627
10 days, I'll give you 10 days.

118
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:23,413
There are really some stingy people in this world..

119
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:42,312
Excuse me..

120
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,485
Makino Tsukushi just submitted a leave of absence!

121
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:57,591
I think she's finally not able to pay her tuition fee, right?

122
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,523
At this rate, she'll have to quit school for sure!

123
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:02,362
Awesome, that'll be soo great!

124
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:05,031
Are they serious?

125
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,400
After last night's talk with Yuuki-chan..

126
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,199
Dropping out of school..
It's not an impossible story, right?

127
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,964
It's really Tsukasa's Mother's work, after all..

128
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:14,281
Well, we don't know that yet.

129
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:30,225
What are we going to do?

130
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:34,813
On top of being laid off, we have a 5 million yen debt..

131
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:37,348
It wasn't like that at first...

132
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,815
I borrowed, thinking I can pay it off by my next bonus..

133
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:43,848
You say that, but you were just betting on Horse Racing, right?

134
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:45,279
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,461
Especially at times like these..

136
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,604
Let's combine our strengths and do our best!

137
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:55,208
Tsukushi!!

138
00:06:58,913 --> 00:07:01,076
Let's look upwards and walk!

139
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,334
- Hanazawa Rui -

140
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,429
Uh.. why?

141
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:16,090
Looks like things are pretty bad..

142
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,748
Eh?

143
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:21,770
Yeah, but it's totally okay, you know.

144
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,374
I wanted to talk to you about something.
- Eh?

145
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:27,635
Right now, where are you?

146
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:31,218
Ikebukoro's West Gate Park..

147
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,057
'Sup! Makino,

148
00:07:33,057 --> 00:07:34,755
did she come in today?

149
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,536
Nope.

150
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:38,372
Makino just submitted a leave of absence.

151
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:39,020
Eh?

152
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:42,685
He's late..

153
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,049
Whoa-

154
00:07:48,049 --> 00:07:50,294
This is a good place..
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

155
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,314
You're an Eitoku Ojousan, right?

156
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:54,214
Looking for a part time job?

157
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,358
Please excuse me.

158
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:59,723
It's a really awesome part time job!

159
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:03,708
We'll just take a little picture of you in your uniform, and you'll get.

160
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,400
100,000 yen ($828)!

161
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:08,697
Seriously??

162
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,200
I was just thinking,

163
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,445
but I think your Mom-
-Did you hear?

164
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:13,950
Tsukushi-chan..

165
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,319
seems to be really in trouble..

166
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,143
It's really great!

167
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:23,259
Let's just take a few pictures.. a few pictures, okay?
Right here, right here..

168
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:27,122
It'll be great!

169
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:31,928
Hey you!

170
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,761
It's your doing again, huh?

171
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:34,976
I really don't know anything at all.

172
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:35,913
You liar!!

173
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:38,417
When things happen to Makino,
Surely you're involved in it!

174
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,418
I swear, this time..

175
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,865
Your mother has never asked me to do anything..

176
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:43,019
Huh?

177
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,360
You..

178
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,314
You've been conspiring with my "BABA" (old woman, hag)?

179
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:52,471
but..

180
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:53,711
With my own will..

181
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:56,463
I really wanted to be with you..

182
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:59,495
No!!

183
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,207
Will you behave?

184
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:06,828
If you just take your clothes.. You'll get 100,000.

185
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:09,016
You said it's just a picture of me in my uniform..

186
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:12,638
They say for every sweet deal, there's a back side.

187
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,774
Don't come!

188
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:16,210
Don't go any closer!!

189
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,973
The back side is the back side.  And a back side video!

190
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:20,362
Stop it!!!!

191
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:21,660

Hey! This woman, force her down!
- Stop it!!

205
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:38,579
Stop it!!!

206
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,380
Stop it!!!

207
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,207
You guys? Whatcha doin?

208
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:51,806
Hey, don't intrude!

209
00:11:58,602 --> 00:11:59,671
We're running for it!

210
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:09,747
Nee-chan.

211
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:13,370
Can you lend me your strength for a bit?

212
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:21,597
I've been..

213
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:24,220
saved by Hanazawa Rui again..

214
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,120
Thank you.

215
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,810
You didn't talk to Tsukasa,

216
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,104
about the situation with your dad and your leave of absence?

217
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,728
Yeah.

218
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:46,818
Coz' you don't want to unnecessarily let him worry?

219
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:51,336
No, that's not the reason why, or should I say...

220
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,673
It's possible,

221
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,151
that Tsukasa's mother is the one moving behind the scenes..

222
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,333
It can't be..

223
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,711
That person is an Iron Woman after all..

224
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,993
Even so, no matter what, that's just too-

225
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:13,359
No.

226
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:17,110
If there's something to do, 
she's a person who will do it completely and thoroughly.

227
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,870
Don't try to shoulder everything on your own..

228
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,763
If something happens, you can always come to me for help.

229
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,821
Thank you.

230
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:42,041
Iron Woman, huh?

231
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:43,965
Could it be, that is -

232
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:45,685
Who is?

233
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:48,180
Me? I'm an Iron Woman?

234
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,462
Uh no.  It's not you..

235
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:55,468
Umm..

236
00:13:55,468 --> 00:14:00,922
Among the men you once loved.  Was there a parent who will not
care about the means just for the sake of his beloved son?

237
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:02,591
Ahh, it's the inverse of the usual pattern..

238
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,311
Now that you mention, there is..

239
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,930
a troublesome man...

240
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,229
Ahh, bingo!

241
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:08,842
What kind of person was he?

242
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:11,585
Decisively, a woman of the polar!

243
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:12,786
Otsu (strange, queer)

244
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:16,531
She was a woman who raised him by herself.

245
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,982
And at the time that I was introduced to her..

246
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:20,787
She started getting angry, and she was like a fire...

247
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:21,491
Prepare yourself!!

248
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,846
But the two of us stubbornly opposed her!

249
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:27,180
And at that time, we gained our happiness!

250
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,080
Don't under estimate me!!!

251
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,836
After that..?

252
00:14:33,318 --> 00:14:35,639
At the time when I wasn't aware...

253
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,528
I was somehow thrown out by that mother's hands..

254
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:40,933
And that was the end..

255
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:44,664
Ah, by the way!

256
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:47,617
Tsukushi-chan, I forgot..

257
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:49,972
Here, it's not much, but..

258
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:51,720
What is it?

259
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,925
I heard you're having quite some problems?

260
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,042
Uh, no.. It's fine..

261
00:14:58,042 --> 00:14:59,728
It's really not much.

262
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:00,519
Uh, but..

263
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,874
Once your father gets a job, and everything calms down, 
you can just properly pay me then..

264
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:07,960
Kami-san..

265
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,716
Everyone's with you, you know..

266
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:14,402
So no matter who your enemy is, don't you dare lose!

267
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:16,457
Yes..

268
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,461
Thank you.

269
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,057
Eh, is that true?

270
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,697
Whenever I go for interview in any company..

271
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,665
When my name comes up, then immediately,

272
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:30,295
the expression on the face of the person in charge changes..

273
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,222
and I get turned away at the door..

274
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,136
Mama went to find a job all day, but..

275
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,522
But whenever I show my resume,

276
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,971
they say that they've got enough people already..

277
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,219
Isn't it strange?

278
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:44,591
I was also turned down for Newspaper delivery and Milk Delivery.

279
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:48,057
Ittekimasu (I'm going and coming back)

280
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:50,382
Wait Papa, where are you going?

281
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,050
Well for now, 
I'm going to a construction site that offers day-to-day employment.

282
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,629
We have to eat, you know.

283
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,221
That person..

284
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,562
She's an Iron Woman..

285
00:15:57,562 --> 00:16:00,135
She's a person who will do something completely and thoroughly.

286
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:07,050
Our family really has to give up things like money or work..

287
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:11,059
That's not it..

288
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,681
Our family is not in the wrong at all.

289
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:35,274
Excuse me.

290
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:36,501
Yes?

291
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,640
Daihyou (Representative)

292
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,091
Makino Tsukushi has..

293
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:43,012
demands to meet with the Daihyou..

294
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,499
It's okay, let her pass.

295
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,436
Neechan's late..

296
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,565
What, Nishida?

297
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:03,814
Excuse me.

298
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:10,047
Coming all the way here,

299
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,186
I wonder what is it about?

300
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:17,444
I have some questions that I would like to ask.

301
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,598
It's exactly what you're thinking..

302
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:30,915
Everything has been schemed by me.

303
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:36,343
Your family declared a war against me.

304
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:39,585
I just took that challenge.

305
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:41,780
That's all it is.

306
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:44,221
Is that all it was?

307
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,643
With Tsukasa,

308
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:48,825
Or with the Domyouji House,

309
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:52,172
You shall not have any relation with them in the future.

310
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,266
Promise me.

311
00:17:55,266 --> 00:18:01,803
If you do, I will return each and everything to the way it was before, 
Ojouchan.

312
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,180
You must be kidding!

313
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,795
Are you baka?

314
00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:14,042
Baka??

315
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,887
Influencing with the power of the money you have­

316
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,723
Doing whatever you want.  Is that interesting?

317
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,906
Being as old as you are,

318
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:22,070
doing things like that of sneaky bullying,  is it fun?

319
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,444
Which god do you intend to be?

320
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,821
Besides-
- I'm not trying to be a god!

321
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,878
For you I might just be a weed,

322
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:31,798
but,

323
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,620
I am not living a life that people have to be ashamed of.

324
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,358
Really?

325
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:43,718
Despising everyone but yourself, you're a detestable human being.

326
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:46,129
For a person such as yourself,

327
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:48,107
I will never do exactly as you say!!

328
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,637
Please excuse me!

329
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:05,926
Obochan (young master)!!

330
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:07,883
Where's Makino?

331
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:09,398
Just now..

332
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,142
What did that "baba" do in Makino's house?

333
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:15,608
The same thing with Tsubaki-sama's..

334
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,759
I will kill that "BABA"!

335
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,685
Please wait!

336
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:26,044
but she,

337
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:28,651
just rejected the Daihyou's proposal.

338
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:33,389
Right now, it's better if you ran after her..

339
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,933
Nishida..

340
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:38,742
Honestly speaking,

341
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:42,282
When I'm with the Daihyou, 
there are times that even I think she's dreadful.

342
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,817
But that girl,

343
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,838
she didn't pull back against that Daihyou, not even one step.

344
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:49,030
"Because I don't want to live a life that 
people have to be ashamed of.

345
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,706
I will never do exactly as the Daihyou says!!"

346
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:58,097
For today, I will properly explain things to the Daihyou.

347
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,117
Thank you.

348
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:10,049
This is bad.. I actually said that..

349
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,622
Makino!!!

350
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:29,698
Feels like..

351
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:32,541
it's been so long..

352
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,664
Yeah.. it seems..

353
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,726
That night before, you completely neglected me.

354
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:48,385
I waited for you over night..

355
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,000
Coz'..

356
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:57,838
The other day..

357
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:00,670
I wanted to show Saturn to you..

358
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,887
Saturn?

359
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,722
Yup, Saturn..

360
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:08,501
And that's why you waited over night?

361
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,517
Coz' me and you are Saturn Beings.

362
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,096
What's that supposed to mean?

363
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:21,926
If I'm not mistaken, Saturn is right in that area..

364
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:44,528
It looks like,

365
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:46,442
you've said some biting words against that "baba"..

366
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:54,082
Blood went to my head, and then I just snapped..

367
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:01,208
Are you regretting it?

368
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:04,212
I'm not-

369
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:06,185
I'm a little scared..

370
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:09,237
But,

371
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:11,933
I definitely do not want to lose.

372
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,212
You know what, I..

373
00:22:20,212 --> 00:22:22,705
will always be your ally..

374
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:25,669
No matter what happens..

375
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:28,335
I will always protect you, Makino.

376
00:22:30,878 --> 00:22:33,396
plus your family, too..

377
00:22:40,832 --> 00:22:42,904
First of all, the debt, huh?

378
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,715
About how much is it?

379
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:50,113
It seems like it's 5 million..

380
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:51,260
Okay-

381
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,136
I'll pay that in advance..

382
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:54,243
Eh?

383
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:56,514
That's no good, definitely no good.

384
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:57,742
Why?

385
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,239
Because..

386
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:03,222
In the end, it's just like I'm getting the money 
from your mother, Domyouji..

387
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:06,065
I don't think that's just right.

388
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:09,537
You may be right, but...

389
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:11,636
in the end what will you do?

390
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,745
I'll try my best to find another part-time job.

391
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:20,957
Rather,

392
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,632
Why don't we just get married?

393
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:25,804
Eh?!

394
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,866
Don't you think it's a nice "idol"? (He's trying to say "idea")

395
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:33,618
Wh... What are you trying to say?

396
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,267
That was just a slip up..

397
00:23:36,677 --> 00:23:40,226
I think it should be a n-nice nice I...

398
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:42,259
I Love You?

399
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:52,142
Onee-chan!

400
00:23:52,612 --> 00:23:54,574
T.O.J.?

401
00:23:54,574 --> 00:23:57,381
Teen Of Japan, also known as T.O.J.

402
00:23:57,381 --> 00:23:59,202
Every 3 years before Christmas...

403
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:01,392
this competition is organised to select
Japan's top high school student.

404
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:04,797
Onee-chan, as well as Shizuka, both have been past winners.

405
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,909
Onee-san and Shizuka-san...

406
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,842
You are judged on your looks, style, general knowledge ...

407
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:12,561
and some Home Making skills in this contest. 

408
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:13,610
That...

409
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,083
That's impossible for me.

410
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,803
And the winner gets 5 million yen...

411
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:20,461
and can attend Eitoku for free.

412
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:22,157
5 million...

413
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:24,665
But isn't registration closed?

414
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:25,729
Don't worry.

415
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:28,194
Past winners can submit their recommendations.

416
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:29,444
Really, onee-chan?

417
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:33,748
I might as well tell you, the first winner
of this contest was our mother.

418
00:24:33,748 --> 00:24:38,375
After that "baba" won, she found Dad.

419
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,539
That's why there's no reason for her not to accept you.

420
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,716
That lass wants to join T.O.J.?

421
00:24:51,148 --> 00:24:53,235
It's not just to participate,

422
00:24:53,235 --> 00:24:55,682
but to win this competition.

423
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:56,862
Win?

424
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,824
You must be kidding.

425
00:24:58,824 --> 00:25:00,746
Well then, if she wins,

426
00:25:00,746 --> 00:25:02,883
you'll allow her to continue her association with Tsukasa,

427
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:06,473
and you will also stop harrassing Makino.

428
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:11,427
That's not even gonna be worth gambling for.

429
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,373
No double dealing on this, okay, Okaasama (mother, respectful)?

430
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:17,672
There's a possibility...

431
00:25:17,672 --> 00:25:18,660
for me to win?

432
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,231
None.

433
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:21,127
What's up with that?

434
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:26,249
But, if you seriously want to win this competition,

435
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:29,205
I will be all-out on my support for you.

436
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:30,551
Nee-san...

437
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:33,202
How 'bout it, Tsukushi-chan?

438
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:34,572
Go ahead, Makino.

439
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:36,116
Even pigs can be pearls...

440
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:37,502
I'll participate, nee-san.

441
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,461
I look forward to working with you.

442
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:41,192
Makino is joining T.O.J.?

443
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:41,912
Are you sure?

444
00:25:41,912 --> 00:25:43,661
That's why you guys cooperate, okay?

445
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:45,049
Tsukasa, are you serious?

446
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,031
But, no matter what, there isn't a chance she could win.

447
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:48,855
Have you forgotten?

448
00:25:48,855 --> 00:25:50,699
Makino, all by herself,

449
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,901
stood up against us, the F4.

450
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:57,927
Help her win,

451
00:25:57,927 --> 00:25:59,562
and let my sh*tty "baba"...

452
00:25:59,562 --> 00:26:01,994
No, let the whole of Japan...

453
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,792
accept that Makino is the greatest woman.

454
00:26:04,244 --> 00:26:06,152
That's interesting.

455
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:07,653
Makino is specially training at my home.

456
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:08,702
Let's go see her now.

457
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:09,375
Let's go!

458
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,458
Yes!

459
00:26:10,884 --> 00:26:13,623
That girl's not good at all those things.

460
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:16,419
Beauty and style, knowledge, and homemaking.

461
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:17,695
Homemaking!

462
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,053
Tsukasa looks like he's having fun.

463
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,750
Listen, the judging is split into three categories.

464
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:25,666
The first is beauty.

465
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,752
Beauty...

466
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,483
Outward appearance, of course.  But inward beauty is also important.

467
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:33,101
Tea and Flowers are standards.

468
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:35,254
Have you ever raised up Tea? 
(raise up tea is to do a tea ceremony:  Tatteru)

469
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:37,868
Aaah... If it's just Tea...

470
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:39,095
You've learned it already!

471
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:43,041
Rather than saying I've learned it.  
It's basically just common sense.

472
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:49,792
Ah... The tea leaf stalk is standing up!
<Tsubaki said to raise up the Tea, which is the same word as to 
stand up. Tsukushi thinks that raising up Tea, is the same as 
the tea leaf stalk standing upright>

473
00:26:49,803 --> 00:26:51,713
Really? Really? Let's see!

474
00:26:52,631 --> 00:26:59,950
But, onee-san, you don't stand the tea up, you pour it in.

475
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,712
Otsu (strange, queer).
Tea is from square one, huh?

476
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:03,826
Hai?

477
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,601
The second category is knowledge.

478
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:10,598
During our time, Liberal Education, Language Study, 
and until some Specialty Fields..

479
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:12,808
A quiz that contained practically everything..

480
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:14,466
A quiz...

481
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,773
I think I'm pretty good with quizzes.

482
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:21,794
Next question. What bird does kogaru (High School Call Girls) 
hate?

483
00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:23,214
I know!

484
00:27:23,214 --> 00:27:25,053
Kanariya!
<"Kanariya" is "Kanari iya : I hate canary" and 
it is an expression for "I kinda hate it", 
and this expression is used by Call Girls>

485
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:27,324
Ka-Na-Ri-Ya....

486
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:28,447
Correct!

487
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:32,447
I think I can do it...

488
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,964
And for your information, it's not a puzzle or riddle quiz.

489
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:36,044
Eh?

490
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:41,750
And the third category is your homemaking skills.
It is a little sneaky.

491
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,402
What kind of test did you have for the homemaking category?

492
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:48,666
Back then, we had to make okonomiyaki.

493
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,114
Making okonomiyaki?

494
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:55,958
There were many who have never made,
or even eaten it.

495
00:27:55,953 --> 00:27:59,625
But I was very lucky. It was one of Tsukasa's favorites.

496
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:04,250
He suddenly said "I want to eat it, I want to eat it!"  So I had to remember how to cook it, and let him eat it.

497
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:06,467
Little boy, do you want some okonomiyaki?

498
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:11,569
Food that is eaten by poor people..  I don't want it!

499
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:13,818
Out of those who weren't eliminated already,

500
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:17,183
not even one could make okonomiyaki.

501
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:21,333
Then... Would say that it was the okonomiyaki
that allowed you to win?

502
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:22,822
Yeah.

503
00:28:22,822 --> 00:28:26,592
In other words, 
you really never know what will happen in this competition.

504
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:31,750
If you're not good at each and everything, 
then there's no way to win..

505
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:36,478
There are only two weeks left before the competition.

506
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:41,040
What's next is very serious training for you.
You should prepare yourself.

507
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:45,571
After all, I..

508
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,344
This isn't like you at all...

509
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,224
Eh?

510
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:59,649
Where is the person who gave my sh*tty "baba"
a piece of her mind straight in the face?

511
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:06,349
Everyone is lending their strengths for your sake.

512
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:10,127
And...

513
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:15,717
Those are the teachers who will be instructing you.

514
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,221
Makino.

515
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:20,656
I'll help sharpen you.

516
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:23,745
We will all be beside you, rest assured, Makino.

517
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:26,457
I told you that if something happens, 
you can always come to me for help.

518
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:37,656
Everyone...

519
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:41,920
Thank you!

520
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,312
Thank us when you've won the competition.

521
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:51,708
I will...

522
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,448
Do my best!

523
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:59,114
Raise the cup.

524
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,774
No! No!

525
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:03,875
Fix your posture. You mustn't raise your shoulders.

526
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,319
Yes!

527
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:10,999
Don't make vulgar sounds.

528
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,097
Yes!

529
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:14,377
Take a look at Tsukasa.

530
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,068
What would you like to eat? (chinese)

531
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,577
What would you like to eat? (chinese)

532
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:36,202
What would you like to eat?

533
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:39,684
Peking duck.

534
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:42,131
I would please like to eat the Peking duck.

535
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,718
Then do it until here.

536
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:00,621
Until there, one more time.

537
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:03,232
Yes!

538
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,625
Nishida, please continue carrying out the contingency plan.

539
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,829
Ma'am, about the plan...

540
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:25,314
It's just for my concern.  So just concern yourself in it.

541
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:27,214
Understood.

542
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:29,120
Excuse me.

543
00:31:33,757 --> 00:31:37,164
I've decided to enter T.O.J.

544
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:43,748
I will definitely not let Makino win this competition.

545
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,426
It's impossible for you.

546
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:51,224
Until now. Thank you for all your hard work.

547
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:56,632
Wait a minute, Okaa-sama.

548
00:31:56,632 --> 00:31:58,627
Okaa-sama?

549
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,510
I've never asked you to call me okaa-sama.

550
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:16,708
Ah, hello? Ayano-chan? Domyouji speaking. How are you?

551
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:29,083
No no, wrong. Pay closer attention to your left hand.

552
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:32,794
If this goes on, you won't win, you know?
Takosuke (octopus)

553
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:34,352
Don't call me Takosuke.

554
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,855
I'm working very hard at this.

555
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,218
Come on, one more time.

556
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:15,165
She says you do not have the proper foundation.

557
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:18,693
Your posture is poor, that's why it falls off.

558
00:33:18,693 --> 00:33:20,338
Hai.  Then, one more time.

559
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:29,792
What's wrong? Do you want a break?

560
00:33:29,796 --> 00:33:33,002
Seriously, you're really no good at anything you do.

561
00:33:36,977 --> 00:33:41,439
I've just started.
How do you expect me to be good at it?

562
00:33:53,672 --> 00:33:56,133
It's useless.

563
00:33:57,107 --> 00:34:01,860
If this continues, there's no way I can win.

564
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,948
Hello. Yuuki? What's wrong?

565
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:26,146
Why are you suddenly closing down my business?

566
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:30,282
Is there a problem with the goods that we're selling?

567
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:32,682
What is the reason?

568
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:37,157
Please tell me the reason you are doing this!

569
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:40,957
Please tell me why...

570
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,640
Wait!

571
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,417
I'm very sorry, I still have a lot of things to settle.

572
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,591
This isn't what we arranged the last time, right?

573
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:03,569
I beg of you, please give us some more time.

574
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,006
So annoying!

575
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:11,857
I can't wait on your family and just look at you forever.

576
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:14,364
Please give us 2 more days..

577
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:22,413
I beg of you... Please...

578
00:35:30,232 --> 00:35:37,542
<Announcement: ... has received support
from the Domyouji representatives.>

579
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:43,000
< Critics believe that even the government
cannot stop the Domyouji Corporation from advancing further >

580
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:46,755
< Prime Minister in the shadow of the
Domyouji Corporation!! >

581
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:14,583
What's up?  Revival of your will to fight?
Clumsy and stupid and blockhead Makino-kun?

582
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:21,289
I think...

583
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:23,450
I'm quitting after all.

584
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,692
Huh?

585
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:32,914
My opponent is just too strong.

586
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:38,022
Even I admit raise my arms in defeat.

587
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:42,006
She has completely filled the outer moat. 
(castle's moat or waterway, 
she meant that she has placed the perfect barrier)

588
00:36:42,006 --> 00:36:44,987
Really, everything came one after another...

589
00:36:48,352 --> 00:36:51,912
This time, I've found the wrong person to fight...

590
00:36:55,823 --> 00:37:00,163
I will properly apologize to Onee-san, as well as the others.

591
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,420
Your guts have flown away, huh?

592
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:12,208
After all, you're only a woman of that level.

593
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,891
Making a pathetic face.

594
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:21,317
As if you're an underdog.

595
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,557
What would you know?

596
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,000
Being this rich, living a life completely free of discomfort.
You who have never experienced hardships.

597
00:37:35,007 --> 00:37:36,895
What would you know?!

598
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,875
How can I possibly understand the feelings of
a poor person like you?

599
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:56,089
Makino Tsukushi has to be this way.

600
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:57,210
Huh?

601
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,295
With that "Weed Power", you'll be alright.

602
00:38:04,189 --> 00:38:07,560
For Makino, A smile suits you the best,

603
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,665
And maybe your angry face, too.

604
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:29,861
It's because of your mom...

605
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:32,825
that so many innocent people got involved.

606
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:36,437
If you win, everything will be alright.

607
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:43,792
But I've caused so much trouble to so many people.

608
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:51,917
I can't do this anymore..

609
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:57,083
I'm at my limit, already.

610
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:08,030
For now Rui will be doing really well about your family.

611
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,269
Carry this.

612
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:19,458
Plus, even if some weird guys come crashing, it'll be alright.  
The SPs (Special Police; Agents) at Rui's Place will watch over.

613
00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:24,911
You don't have to worry about the Confectionary shop either.

614
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:32,542
As for Soujiro, the Nishikado Ichimon will order large quantities of 
confectionary to use for their Tea Parties, for now.

615
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:43,250
And that Akira, I think there's something going on with him 
and that Confectionary Store's Kami-san. And so he desperately 
pleaded with Soujiro's father.

616
00:39:45,129 --> 00:39:50,130
Everyone is lending their strengths for your sake.

617
00:39:54,027 --> 00:39:58,292
If we, the F4, are on your side.  Is there anything to be afraid of?

618
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:10,629
Just be yourself and do it.

619
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,401
Coz' I believe in you.

620
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:23,358
Have some confidence.

621
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:28,461
You're the woman that I have recognized after all.  
Obviously, you're the best!

622
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:32,151
I...

623
00:40:32,151 --> 00:40:33,721
No problem.

624
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:37,903
The Saturn beings will create a miracle at the last moment 
(at the eleventh hour).

625
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:43,984
What's that all about?

626
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:51,458
You and I, from the very beginning were destined to be together.

627
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:01,235
I'll do my best.

628
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:10,288
Do your best.

629
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:23,379
Ah... F4!
<Teen Of Japan 2005>
<You could instantly be the next star in Japan's history>

630
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:27,154
But, Domyouji can really do anything, right?

631
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:30,922
It's because I was taught by my "satellite" (eisei).
<It should be "sensei">

632
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:34,958
Tsk.  He's really weakest in his Japanese though.

633
00:41:34,938 --> 00:41:38,875
I'm telling you, there's no such thing as strong or weak in Japanese.
 It's a language after all.

634
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:43,537
Are you sure you'll be alright?

635
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,349
There he goes again...

636
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,916
Alright!

637
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,385
Let's go!

638
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:21,643
Tsukasa!

639
00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:37,677
Ayano.

640
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:43,397
It's been a while. How are you?

641
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:47,828
Hello everyone.

642
00:42:48,672 --> 00:42:50,374
What are you here for?

643
00:42:50,374 --> 00:42:56,708
Your mom contacted me, 
"With my recommendation, can you please join T.O.J.?

644
00:42:56,689 --> 00:42:59,819
That's why I rushed back here from London.

645
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:04,132
See you later.

646
00:43:08,578 --> 00:43:11,273
We couldn't expect less of Tsukasa's mom.

647
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:13,171
She is an Iron Woman.

648
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:17,027
An unexpected and unbelievable bomb has been launched.

649
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,594
Who was that pretty girl?

650
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:22,954
Kurimaki Ayano.

651
00:43:23,459 --> 00:43:27,719
The daughter of a parliamentarian.  Tsukasa's fiance.

652
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,005
Eh?

653
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,849
Excuse me.

654
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,666
Sakurako!

655
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:04,037
In here, we're mutual enemies,

656
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:08,514
So don't talk to me that easily.

657
00:44:32,709 --> 00:44:35,531
This'll just be an extra luggage.  I don't need it.

658
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,189
I'm going to the toilet.

659
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:48,375
Could everyone please arrange yourselves according
to your number?

660
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:49,978
Yes!

661
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:16,292
And now, Teen Of Japan 2005.
We have the entrance of the contestants.

662
00:46:21,658 --> 00:46:24,323
<Next week, the final episode will be
specially extended by 15 minutes>

663
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,868
<Will the Goddess of Destiny smile upon them...!?>

664
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,672
<The climax of the story, don't miss it!!>

665
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:49,109
Domyouji!
