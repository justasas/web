Episode 8

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,370
Where are you going this late at night?

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,390
I'm on my way to go to practice. Why?

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,680
Do you want to win that badly?

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,630
We don't have a choice.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,620
We?

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,640
Why, does it have to be Ji Hoo of all people?

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,780
If it wasn't Ji Hoo...

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,820
Gu Jun Pyo.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,560
It's not too late even now.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,830
Just one word.

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,440
Just one word... saying that you like me.

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,220
Sorry.

16
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,790
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,030
Do you know what you're doing right now?

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,550
The almighty Gu Jun Pyo is hanging on to you.

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,750
I don't have a choice.

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,060
How could I have liked a girl like you?

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,210
You just threw away your last chance.

22
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,240
It's no use if you cry tomorrow,

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,110
because I'm not going to let you off easy anymore.

24
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,250
That's what I expected.

25
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,380
Of course.

26
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,040
That's more like Geum Jan Di.

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Fine.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,300
Let's see how far we can go.

29
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,670
I'm not going to regret it.

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm not going to regret it.

31
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,970
I won't ever regret it.

32
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,510
So, if he loses this time,
Yoon Ji Hoo is dismissed from F4...

33
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,350
And Geum Jan Di is expelled from school...

34
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,570
That's what you were about to say, right?

35
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
But what if he wins?

36
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,790
Try saying something that makes sense.

37
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,460
You didn't place your bet on the other outcome, did you?

38
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,530
No.

39
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,430
No one would bet on that outcome unless he was crazy.

40
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,650
But what if he wins in a 1 out of 10,000 chance?

41
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,970
That's headline news.

42
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,330
Hey, gambling is not a miracle.

43
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,220
Oppa!

44
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,010
Oppa!

45
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,630
We shall now start the last competition.

46
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,230
Athletes, please step forward.

47
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,380
Ready.

48
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,480
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

49
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,200
It's the end for you now!

50
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,270
Yi Jung sunbae, fighting!

51
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,450
Yi Jung is alive!

52
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,180
Jan Di, use your strength!

53
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,150
Just a little more!

54
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,130
Who is it?

55
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,500
Who on earth is it?

56
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Did you see?

57
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,330
Who did it?

58
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,100
Through this, Jan Di's expulsion and Ji Hoo's
dismissal will be as if it never happened.

59
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,570
Nobody has any objections, correct?

60
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,840
You were cool.

61
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,010
Thank you.

62
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,910
I think I should be the one thanking you.

63
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,110
Excuse me?

64
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,320
Because I think my nasty little brother
is growing up decently thanks to someone.

65
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,810
I'll see you again.

66
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,830
It's a relief. Such a relief.

67
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,990
Right?

68
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,900
Geum Jan Di.

69
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,270
That was an awesome competition.

70
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,300
Me too.

71
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,980
We'll be off to Jun Pyo.

72
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,740
Thank you.

73
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,800
Thanks to you...

74
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,850
Geum Jan Di.

75
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,420
Do you want to go on a date with me?

76
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,370
Gu Jun Pyo...

77
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,900
you certainly are repaying a debt.

78
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,960
Why are you mumbling to yourself,
as if you're out of your mind?

79
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,370
The impact was pretty big though.

80
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,290
Do you remember when I broke
Ji Hoo's robot, in kindergarten?

81
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,460
Robot?

82
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,160
The one made out of wood?

83
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,620
Yeah.

84
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,290
<i>Ji Hoo, gave this to me. </i>

85
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,720
<i>No.</i>

86
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,490
<i>Give this to me. I'll give you all my toys. </i>

87
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,330
I can't give you that, Jun Pyo.

88
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,340
You're so cheap.

89
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,100
What can't be mine?

90
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,300
It's mine now.

91
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,870
They say Ji Hoo's deceased father
had made that robot himself for Ji Hoo.

92
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,890
After that, I've always thought
that I had a debt to him.

93
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,090
You're saying that you're going to repay it
with what happened this time?

94
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,760
Because,

95
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,700
I can't ruin Geum Jan Di,
so that nobody can have her.

96
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,840
Rascal.

97
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,950
Jun Pyo.

98
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,320
Do you want to go on a date with me?

99
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,410
Date?

100
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,860
Jan Di.

101
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,620
Hey!

102
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,320
I'm going out to get some fresh air and exercise.

103
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,750
Dressed like that?

104
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,290
Actually...

105
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,900
You're going out to go on a date
with Ji Hoo hyungnim, correct?

106
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,300
How'd you know?

107
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,010
Although giving Young Master
Jun Pyo a scar was bad of you,

108
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:18,000
love doesn't always go as planned, does it?

109
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,330
Of course, of course.

110
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,610
If you get blocked, then you can do a u-turn.

111
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,110
If you go far, you can go to Seoul.

112
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,760
What is that supposed to mean?

113
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,620
That is...

114
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,570
It means that you have to look good
in Young Master Ji Hoo's eyes.

115
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,920
Isn't that skirt a little too long?

116
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,670
Can't you dress a little sexier?

117
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,020
Jan Di, your lips are much too dry.

118
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,130
Lick your lips a little bit.

119
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,110
For a woman, her fragrance is important.

120
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,370
A fragrance of seduction that nobody can reject.

121
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,890
Seriously!!

122
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,180
I'll be off.

123
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,590
What did they say he has?

124
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,290
Su Am Culture Foundation.

125
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,690
Real Barcelona! Hana Dolphins!

126
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,260
And the past president's grandson's wife?

127
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,130
What time is that you're still like this?

128
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,260
Let's go out.

129
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,960
I don't want to.

130
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,970
Yo, do you want to go to a shooting range?

131
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,280
- I'll pass.
- A drive?

132
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,680
I'm too lazy.

133
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,150
Then... shopping?

134
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,940
I told you I'm not interested.

135
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,500
The weather is this nice, and
you're just going to sit in here?

136
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,000
That rascal Ji Hoo.

137
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,480
He must be feeling like going on a date.

138
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,170
But... if Ji Hoo and Geum Jan Di meet,
what do you think they'd do?

139
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,670
I really can't imagine it.

140
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,610
You're right.

141
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,680
Don't you think they'd go somewhere with a
lot of sunlight and take a nap together?

142
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,300
Resting their heads on each other’s arms, too?

143
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,420
Hey, let's go out.

144
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,960
Let's go!

145
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,250
The first Christmas present she gave me was this.

146
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,250
She gave you a horse as a present?

147
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,390
When I was small,

148
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,100
I had to beg my parents for four
days and three nights for a puppy.

149
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,100
What happened?

150
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,940
I just got beaten up.

151
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,610
How about a horse instead of a puppy?

152
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,150
Geum Jan Di.

153
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,160
Want to ride that?

154
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,340
Young Master, I brought the
coffee that you requested.

155
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,410
<i>Here. </i>

156
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,030
<i>30,000 Won coffee. </i>

157
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,070
<i>How is it? I was right, wasn't I? </i>

158
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,210
<i>It's the same as drinking coffee in a hotel sky lounge. </i>

159
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,840
Do you want to drink something?

160
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,170
No, I'm fine.

161
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,070
It's my first time riding this.

162
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,060
Have you ridden this before?

163
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,450
<i>Gu Jun Pyo <3 Geum Jan Di
"First Night Together"</i>

164
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,850
Are you not feeling well?

165
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,720
Huh?

166
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,160
No, I'm fine.

167
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,590
She's probably doing well, right?

168
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,160
Let's not bring that talk up.

169
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,570
I'm sorry.

170
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,630
If everything works out by saying sorry,
then why would there laws in the world

171
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,740
and why would there be police?

172
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,270
Where is this place?

173
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,790
My house.

174
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,460
Yoo Ji Hoo / Min Seo Hyun

175
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,870
Yoo Ji Hoo / Min Seo Hyun

176
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,290
I don't see anyone here.

177
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,100
It's uncomfortable with people around.

178
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,790
They all come and leave when I'm not around.

179
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,910
I see.

180
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,630
It's kind of strange.

181
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,330
I don't feel uncomfortable
when you're around though.

182
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,840
I'm comfortable without any reason,

183
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,530
and it's amusing in an odd way.

184
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,740
You're warm everywhere.

185
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,340
Me?

186
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,340
I think I know...

187
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,760
why Jun Pyo likes you.

188
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,370
Geum Jan Di.

189
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,340
Oh my! This is Seo Hyun unni.

190
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,350
Ji Hoo sunbae is in here as well.

191
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,200
It's that horse that I saw a while ago.

192
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,520
Maybe that's your Christmas present?

193
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,190
Hey!

194
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,140
What the guys say might be true.

195
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,810
If Seo Hyun's incident never happened,

196
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,980
I might not have turned out with you like this.

197
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,650
What about Seo Hyun unni...?

198
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,360
She said that she's not marrying that man.

199
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,160
Then...?

200
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,030
But that doesn't change anything.

201
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,460
How does it not?

202
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,510
I think,

203
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,400
it's time that I let her go.

204
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,100
Sunbae.

205
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,510
Anyways, thanks.

206
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,830
Thanks to you,

207
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,480
I think I'll be able to let her go.

208
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,460
My first love.

209
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,020
Sunbae.

210
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,430
They say that,

211
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,810
there are ties in this world,

212
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,510
where no matter how many times you break up,
you somehow meet again.

213
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,500
You'll be able to meet her again.

214
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:05,590
Because the both of you...

215
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,540
because...

216
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,680
Because...

217
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,060
Because...

218
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,950
thanks to Seo Hyun unni,

219
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,140
I think I'll be able to let him go.

220
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,930
My,

221
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
first love.

222
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,130
Goodbye, Ji Hoo sunbae.

223
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,390
I might regret it once again.

224
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,600
But I should send her away, right?

225
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,310
What's up with him, again?

226
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,450
It's probably because of Geum Jan Di.

227
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,240
Geum Jan Di is with Ji Hoo...

228
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,890
it looks like the record will be broken tonight.

229
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,600
{\an8}[Let's meet at the ice hockey rink.
Anybody up for a game?]

230
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,180
Who is this rascal to tell who to come and go?

231
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,480
You should be dating.

232
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,450
What is this to be calling people out in the middle of the night?

233
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,460
You're right.

234
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,860
I was about to do that,

235
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,060
but it got a little boring.

236
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,360
So, I ran away.

237
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,590
What?

238
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,630
I don't like easy girls.

239
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,400
I thought she was a complete guy,
but she turned out to be like a woman.

240
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,370
Ji Hoo, what's up with you?

241
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,190
She followed me all the way home.

242
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,280
She just wouldn't leave.

243
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,180
Hey, stop.

244
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,570
I was a little shaky because of Seo Hyun,

245
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,240
but she couldn't be more than just child's play.

246
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,320
That bastard...

247
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,910
Hey, are you okay?

248
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,640
Let go!

249
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,520
Say that one more time.

250
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,630
What is what?!

251
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,700
She wasn't bad for just child's play.

252
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,000
You really want to die?

253
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,300
She doesn't have anything to do with you now anyway.

254
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,430
She does.

255
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,430
Even if she doesn't, she does, you son of a bitch!

256
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,700
Let go. Let go!

257
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,370
Let go!

258
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,790
If you hurt Geum Jan Di, I'll kill you
regardless that you're my friend. Got it?!

259
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,660
You should've said it from the start.

260
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,130
See?

261
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,660
You can't let go of Geum Jan Di, right?

262
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,380
See how good it would've been if you came out honestly?
I wouldn't need to do something like this.

263
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,130
You crazy son of a bitch.

264
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,850
You picked a pretty strong strategy.

265
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,280
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

266
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,020
He had a debt to repay.

267
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,290
He broke my robot, remember?

268
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,120
Cheap stuff suits you the best. 

269
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,990
If you lose it because it was cheap, then you're dead. 

270
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,760
Just one word. 

271
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:07,100
Just one word... saying that you like me. 

272
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,380
<i>[Gu Jun Pyo]</i>

273
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,340
I don't want my feelings to get hurt because of you.

274
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,520
I'm feeling really...

275
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,890
Yi Jung sunbae?

276
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,240
Huh?

277
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,860
What did you say?

278
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,470
{\an8}Gu Jun Pyo

279
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,760
Get up.

280
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,530
Gu Jun Pyo, get up.

281
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,700
Geum Jan Di is here.

282
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,870
Get up, you rascal!

283
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,230
This doesn't make any sense.

284
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,560
You're lying, right?

285
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,400
Why would he suddenly...?

286
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,050
What happened?

287
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,720
He ran out saying that he was going
out to see you, and then...

288
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,060
Gu Jun Pyo, get up.

289
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,490
Why are you being like this?

290
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,540
I have a lot to tell you.

291
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,950
I have a lot of things to fight with you about,

292
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,020
and I have a lot of things to teach you too.

293
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,170
What are you?!

294
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,940
He was being depressed all day, and
he suddenly said that he needed to go apologize.

295
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,850
I should be the one to apologize.

296
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,810
Gu Jun Pyo, I'm sorry.

297
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,480
I lied to you.

298
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,760
When you asked me

299
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,130
to do say that word one time for you...

300
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,450
I regretted it after I sent you away.

301
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,130
Gu Jun Pyo.

302
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,960
Gu Jun Pyo, get up.

303
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,900
I think I can tell you the words that you wanted to hear now,

304
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,730
so how can you be lying here like this?

305
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,900
Get up.

306
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,190
Really?

307
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,710
Hey, Geum Jan Di must've been really surprised.

308
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,300
Look at her shoes.

309
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,640
Jun Pyo, you must be feeling happy.

310
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,950
They say it's -10 degrees Celsius. Aren't you cold?

311
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,290
Geum Jan Di, I'm so moved.

312
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,520
If I was Jun Pyo, I wouldn't have any
complaints even if I died right now.

313
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,620
Sunbae...

314
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,030
Sorry. You two are beyond stubborn.

315
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,960
Tell me quickly what you were
about to say a little while ago.

316
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:02,850
What?

317
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,940
The words that I wanted to hear.

318
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,190
"I think I can tell you the words
that you wanted to hear now..."

319
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,580
You want to die?

320
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,400
You're hitting a patient?

321
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,700
You're a patient?

322
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,810
<i>What is this?</i>

323
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:36,870
One, two, three, four.

324
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,740
Five, six, seven, eight.

325
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,630
Two, two, three, four.

326
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,510
Five, six, seven, eight.

327
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,470
Two, two, three, four!

328
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,790
What are you doing in someone
else's neighborhood this early?

329
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,220
The roads are slippery, so you should
be at home. Why are you running  around?

330
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,430
I'm exercising right now.

331
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,850
You exercise, that shows you're poor too.

332
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,370
Get in.

333
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,260
Why?

334
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,650
You said that you were exercising.

335
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,420
Hey!

336
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:44,790
What are you doing?

337
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:45,540
Get in.

338
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,730
Nice shot.

339
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,120
You try it too.

340
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,520
Bend your knees.

341
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,110
A little more, a little more.

342
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,560
Straighten your back.

343
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,660
Good shot.

344
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,470
Nice shot!

345
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,770
Hey, Gu Jun Pyo!

346
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,830
Hey!

347
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,850
I'm full.

348
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,400
If you're done eating, let's go.

349
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,410
You go ahead.

350
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,170
I'll be right back.

351
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,580
Here you go.

352
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,100
Thank you.

353
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:41,190
Thank you. I'll come again next time!

354
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,340
Thank you.

355
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,080
Oh my, who is this?

356
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,760
Isn't it Geum Jan DI?

357
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,310
What are you doing here?

358
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,750
- Do you know her?
- No.

359
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,320
What is that?

360
00:47:58,590 --> 00:47:59,550
Oh god, the smell!

361
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,840
Are you taking care of the restaurant's trash?

362
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,220
Oh no, what to do. I think she's taking some other person's food home.

363
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,310
So trashy.

364
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,090
Would you wait a moment?

365
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,640
You can take home our leftovers.

366
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,130
What are you guys?

367
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,790
Why are you sitting here like this?

368
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,670
Jun Pyo, long time no see.

369
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,960
Your tastes have changed since the last time I've seen you.

370
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,050
Who is she?

371
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,160
Your housemaid?

372
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,870
Do you want to shut your mouth quietly?

373
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,610
Or should I make it so that
an article comes out tomorrow morning

374
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:55,040
saying that your company closed doors?

375
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,180
Sorry.

376
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,330
Not to me.

377
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:08,060
I apologize. Please forgive me.

378
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:31,530
<i>What should I do?</i>

379
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,650
<i>I can't swallow my saliva naturally.</i>

380
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,490
<i>How should I start so it seems natural?</i>

381
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,690
<i>Why is it so hot?</i>

382
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,430
<i>If I take my jacket off saying that it's hot,
she'll probably go berserks, right?</i>

383
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,250
<i>Gosh really...</i>

384
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,570
<i>Why is that kind of scene coming out all of a sudden?</i>

385
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:59,130
<i>Gu Jun Pyo, now is the time.</i>

386
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,090
<i>Turn your head!</i>

387
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:01,960
<i>No!</i>

388
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,750
<i>Please don't look at me now!</i>

389
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,750
<i>Gu Jun Pyo, if you turn your head, you're so dead!</i>

390
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,820
<i>I really can't do it.</i>

391
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:14,020
<i>Gosh really, let's just eat some popcorn.</i>

392
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,520
Pick up the phone, please~

393
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,440
Pick up the phone, please~

394
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,330
Pick up the phone, please~

395
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:00,110
Pick up the phone, please~

396
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,850
Pick up the phone, please~

397
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,230
Hello?

398
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,870
Jan Di!

399
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,760
I'm home.

400
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,920
Honey, that's eel.

401
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,990
Eel.

402
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,580
The eel that gives you a lot of energy?

403
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,670
Eel.

404
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,070
Where did all this come from?

405
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,770
It's so obvious. Why do you ask
every single time you see it?

406
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,090
They say Jun Pyo hyungnim ordered it for us.

407
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,900
The hotel chef himself brought it.

408
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,320
He brought a tune this big and sliced it here himself.

409
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,910
I knew it was a tuna because he told me.
I originally thought it was a whale!

410
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,210
Eat up, honey. Eat a lot.

411
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,110
Honey, let's die tonight after we eat!

412
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:58,490
Let's eat and die!

413
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,640
<i>Give it to your father.</i>

414
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,400
<i>I'm telling you this because you might get mad again,</i>

415
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,530
<i>But... it's not for you.</i>

416
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,840
<i>Don't even eat a single piece!</i>

417
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,790
So I was walking,

418
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,650
and then someone from behind tapped my shoulder.

419
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,250
Oh my, oh my.  And then, and then?

420
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,030
Do you want to go see a movie with me?

421
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,460
That's so cheesy!

422
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,280
Jan Di, is there something wrong?

423
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,350
<i>[Gu Jun Pyo]</i>

424
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,230
Hello?

425
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:39,040
Oh, Gu Jun Pyo?

426
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,870
I can't really hear you well.

427
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,830
I'm at the porridge shop, and I'm super busy.

428
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,370
There are so many customers.

429
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,550
Excuse me, could you give us one abalone porridge?

430
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,240
Yes, customer.

431
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,080
You heard that?

432
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,990
I'm so busy that I think I'll have to work all night,

433
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,300
so I don't think I'll be able to see you for a while.

434
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,170
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

435
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,360
Jan Di, which porridge shop are you talking about?

436
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,150
<i>Excuse me, could you give us some more kimchi?</i>

437
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,180
Yes, in a moment please.

438
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,130
Ji Hoo sunbae.

439
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,090
Thank you.

440
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,720
It's warm.

441
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:09,960
You're practicing even during break?

442
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,980
Just because.

443
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,880
It didn't seem like just because.

444
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,570
I thought you were at Taereung
National Training Village.

445
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,130
I feel refreshed after I exercise.

446
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:23,950
Are you feeling uncomfortable somehow?

447
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,180
What about you, Sunbae?

448
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,970
Why did you come out to school?

449
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,370
I left some sheet music here.

450
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,760
Yeah, Jun Pyo.

451
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,870
Me? I'm at school.

452
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:44,140
I'm with Geum...

453
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,390
Okay, then. I'll wait.

454
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,420
Alright.

455
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,200
Jun Pyo says he's on his way.

456
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,300
If you wait, you'll be able to see him.

457
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,220
I see.

458
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,980
But why...?

459
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,940
I'm really busy today,

460
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,570
so I need to go home quickly.

461
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,890
I completely forgot.

462
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,240
Sunbae, I'll see you later.

463
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,550
Thank you for the drink.

464
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,080
What? You were with someone?

465
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,410
Huh? No.

466
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,200
It's all cooled.

467
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,210
From plentiful steamed Galbi, all land, sea and sky are coming out.

468
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,210
<i>{\a6}(Yuk Hae Gong: land, sea, sky which means meat, fish and birds... all kinds of food)</i>

469
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,650
Looks good.

470
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,590
It really is a catastrophe... We've ruined our
taste buds by eating only delicacies.

471
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,740
Is Noona going on a date anytime soon?

472
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,230
You're right.

473
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,860
I hope she goes to a Chinese restaurant
this time. Don't you?

474
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,340
We have to get Italian.

475
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,210
<i>A luxurious European full course meal.</i>

476
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:00,940
<i>You're right.</i>

477
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,220
<i>Those snails.</i>

478
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,470
<i>Escarrrrrgot.</i>

479
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,270
<i>That's French.</i>

480
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,200
Who is it?

481
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:21,830
Who is it?

482
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,010
If they came to collect a bill,
tell them your parents aren't home.

483
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,060
The...

484
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,460
They came for the dishes?

485
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,060
Did you guys order something while I wasn't here?

486
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,900
Ju...

487
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,430
If they're from the landowner,
tell them that your parents passed away.

488
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:39,340
Jun Pyo!

489
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,000
Jun Pyo hyungnim!

490
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,570
What?

491
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,470
S-s-shinhwa...?

492
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,720
Young Master.

493
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,720
Can I go in?

494
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,280
What are you doing here this late at night?

495
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,640
What do you mean late?

496
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,200
It's only 10 o'clock.

497
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,910
It's the early evening.

498
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:34,820
Father.

499
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,140
Father. Did you hear?

500
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,590
He called me father.

501
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,150
And Mother.

502
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:45,680
Honey.

503
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,810
Please let me sleep here for one night.

504
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,070
What?

505
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,280
Are you crazy?

506
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,750
Why are you sleeping here when you have your nice house?

507
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:00,540
And by who's permission?

508
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,280
Father's permission.

509
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,750
Mother's permission.

510
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,820
Mom!

511
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,170
Of course you must sleep here.

512
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,620
It's so late.

513
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,850
It's already past 10.

514
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,030
Where are you planning to go this late?

515
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,580
Hyungnim, sleep with me.

516
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:15,560
No!

517
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,390
They're like shorts on you.

518
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,840
They're perfect!

519
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:30,000
My word... whatever you wear, it's so cool.

520
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,030
You're a complete model.

521
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:35,250
Don't you think that this style will become a trend?

522
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,660
Everything is ready.

523
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,330
Ready? Ready for what?

524
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,760
Tada~

525
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:52,030
<i>Honey! Those blankets!</i>

526
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:56,640
<i>Our first night together during our honeymoon.</i>

527
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,840
<i>We slept together in those blankets.</i>

528
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,660
Mom!

529
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,330
Gu Jun Pyo.

530
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,580
Are you really going to come out like this?

531
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,880
I came here without thinking,

532
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,180
but it turns out to be really fun.

533
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:38,910
What?

534
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,090
How can the masters bedroom
be smaller than our restroom?

535
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,610
Your restroom is the one that's abnormal.

536
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:49,490
What's even more amusing is that
five people sleep together like this.

537
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,710
Is it amusing to you?

538
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:51,900
Then, is it not?

539
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,140
Then, keep being amused.

540
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:55,930
Don't regret it.

541
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,630
What, regret?

542
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:00,430
It's like a refugee camp experience,
so I'm feeling thrill 10,000 points.

543
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,220
I'm going to sleep.

544
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,990
