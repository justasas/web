Final Episode

4
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,135
Abracadabra...

5
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:00,723
Gu Jun Pyo, you will
remember Geum Jan Di.

6
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,831
You will remember!

7
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,787
Abracadabra...

8
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:07,794
Now!

9
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:09,340
Oh, you scared me!

10
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,150
Hey kiddo, what are you doing?

11
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,270
You must've been too stressed lately.

12
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,880
Getting a pimple on that handsome face...

13
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,610
And what's this?

14
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:27,600
Can't you tell? It's a lunchbox.

15
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,210
A lunchbox?

16
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,050
Is it good?

17
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,880
This...

18
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,010
- Did you make this?
- Huh?

19
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:27,800
Yeah. If you like it, then I'll make it again for you.

20
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,794
You may get thirsty.
Should I get you some water?

21
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,030
I remembered something.

22
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,350
What I forgot... it's you, isn't it?

23
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,380
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

24
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,800
Yes, goodbye!  Please come again.

25
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,800
Welcom...

26
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,920
One abalone porridge, please.

27
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,430
For me, a pumpkin porridge.

28
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:17,960
Sunbae!

29
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,240
What brings you all the way here?

30
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,360
Can't you tell?  We came to eat porridge.

31
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:02,253
Oh, it's hot!

32
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,140
Ah, I'm full!  That was good.

33
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,510
Now, tell us.  What's going on?

34
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,433
For Geum Jan Di who can't take care of
her boyfriend because of her part-time job,

35
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:24,289
We prepared some news.

36
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,130
Huh?

37
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,900
Jun Pyo finally got discharged.

38
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,070
Seriously?

39
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,580
How can you save something so important
until you finish eating porridge?!

40
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,660
Hurry up and go.

41
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,352
Ga Eul, stay here.

42
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:47,155
- I'll be back.
- Go.

43
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,350
Sunbae, you're not going?

44
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,060
No.  My reason for coming concerns you.

45
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,853
They look happy.

46
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:35,610
The dishes in there, I mean.

47
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:43,382
Instead of being weary from the heat, I get the feeling that they're happy.

48
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,750
Why?

49
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:51,840
Because they're hoping that if they endure
and turn out well, then they'll be loved.

50
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,200
Just like Ga Eul.

51
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,460
Now, tell me.

52
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,520
I'm ready.

53
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,740
You have something to tell me, don't you?

54
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,210
Today... again, bad news first?

55
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,410
I'm...

56
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,600
Leaving.

57
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,970
But then again, that might not be bad news for you.

58
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,200
To where?

59
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,550
Sweden.

60
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,560
When... no.

61
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,340
For how long?

62
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,550
Soon.  Maybe, around 4 or 5 years?

63
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,150
That's good.

64
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,130
You'll go and become an even better clay artist.

65
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,870
Now that I think about it, this could also be good news.

66
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:06,176
So what's the other news?

67
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,930
That when I come back,

68
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,070
You'll be the very first person whom I'll seek out.

69
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,970
Sunbae.

70
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,410
Well, I meant only if you still haven't
found your soulmate by then.

71
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:38,290
Put in more firewood.  Do you think
that it'll ever reach 1300°C like this?

72
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,210
Gu Jun Pyo, congrats on getting discharged...

73
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,350
Oh, it's Jan Di unni.  Unni, hi!

74
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,010
Oh... hi.  Yu Mi, you're here too.

75
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,570
What are you doing here?

76
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,230
Ji Hoo isn't here.

77
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,790
I heard that you got discharged
so I came to say "congrats".

78
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,997
Jeez, that's really touching.

79
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:21,160
Just look out for your boyfriend.

80
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,260
Does Ji Hoo know what you're doing?

81
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,670
Hey!  Watch what you say.

82
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,350
What?

83
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,240
There's no reason for Ji Hoo sunbae
to hear such talk from you.

84
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,790
Then be careful to not humiliate him.

85
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,270
You're right.

86
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,020
I was wrong to come here.

87
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,280
Be sure to take care of yourself.

88
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,280
What's with you, Oppa?

89
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,840
That's not nice.

90
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,900
Unni, don't go.

91
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,540
<i>Soon, they should be bringing in the tea.</i>

92
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,750
Oppa's tea tastes really great.

93
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,080
Have some before you go.

94
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,460
<i>The tea is ready.</i>

95
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,110
<i>Yes, please bring it over here.</i>

96
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,040
<i>Unni, come here and sit down.</i>

97
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,680
Oh, it looks delicious.

98
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,670
I'll eat it myself.

99
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,000
Is it good?

100
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,180
- It crumbled.
- It crumbled.

101
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,630
You eat it.

102
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,670
Mmm, it's good.

103
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm leaving.

104
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,100
You.

105
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,760
Don't come back.

106
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,440
Whenever I see you, I get into a really bad mood.

107
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,550
I mean, you get on my nerves.

108
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,070
Fine.

109
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,830
I'm sorry.  I won't come again!

110
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,560
Unni!

111
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,550
The person whom Jun Pyo oppa has
to remember... by chance, is it you?

112
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,670
So it is.

113
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,170
But as you can see for yourself, it seems
that seeing you isn't good for him.

114
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,190
<i>Because whenever he sees
you, his condition gets worse.</i>

115
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,590
So for the time being, it may be
better if you don't come here.

116
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,310
<i>Don't worry.</i>

117
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,010
At every opportunity, I'll try to get
him to remember you on his own.

118
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,850
Well, see you!

119
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,860
<i>Make that for me.</i>

120
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,000
<i>What?</i>

121
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,060
<i>The lunchbox that you made before.</i>

122
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,780
Lunchbox?

123
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,490
Yeah.

124
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,370
The egg rollups that you made
when I was in the hospital.

125
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,620
Make that for me again.

126
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,750
Ah, that?

127
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,310
OK, Oppa.

128
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,630
<i>But there are so many tastier dishes here.</i>

129
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,890
<i>Why do you want to eat that, of all things?</i>

130
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,710
My apologies.

131
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,560
Sunbae.

132
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,150
Don't run away.

133
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,240
- Please let go of me.
- You can't.

134
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,110
You can't back down now.

135
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,270
Jan Di!

136
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,310
It's all over now.

137
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,020
It's all useless.

138
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,272
Even though he lost his memory...

139
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,188
Even if we had to start over again...

140
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,100
I had believed that he would remember me.

141
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,560
But... I was wrong.

142
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,120
- It's not like that.
- No.

143
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,670
It may be upsetting and unfair,
but I have to acknowledge it.

144
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,370
The Gu Jun Pyo whom I liked...

145
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,420
The Gu Jun Pyo who loved me...

146
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,790
He doesn't exist anymore.

147
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,200
I told you.  You can't
be the mermaid princess.

148
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,170
You two breaking up because
of this absurd situation...

149
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,020
I can't allow that.

150
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,010
It's not because of Yu Mi.

151
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,200
In the end, Geum Jan Di and Gu Jun Pyo...

152
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,930
Were only...

153
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,890
This must have been all that we were.

154
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,250
Try it.

155
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,720
What?  It doesn't taste good?

156
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,480
This isn't it.

157
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
Huh?

158
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,560
It's not the same taste as before.

159
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,490
That one... Did you really make it?

160
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,750
Of... of course!

161
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,840
Who else could've made it?

162
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,950
It's probably because every time it's made,
the taste comes out differently.

163
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,450
Next time, I'll make it properly.

164
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,090
Is something bothering you?

165
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,210
That girl.

166
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:09,140
Whether it's Jan Di or Jap Cho...*

167
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,139
<i>{\a6}*wordplay: "jan di" = grass; "jap cho" = weed</i>

168
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,490
That girl's expression...

169
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,450
I can't seem to erase it.

170
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,090
That's too much!

171
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,810
How can you be like that?

172
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,750
Ever since the hospital until now,
I'm the one who's been by your side!

173
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,040
But it's the expression of that unni who sometimes
comes by and irritates you which gets to you?

174
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,958
Your friends treat me like I'm
a pain and always take her side.

175
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,330
And her boyfriend ignores me as if I had some disease.

176
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,064
<i>But still...</i>

177
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,880
Because of you...

178
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Because I was worried about you, I tolerated all of it.

179
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,400
But if you're like this too...

180
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:58,410
Then what's Yu Mi* supposed to do?

181
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,410
{\a6}*character's habit to refer to herself in 3rd person

182
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,040
Hey...

183
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,450
What's the matter?

184
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,670
<i>Jun Pyo and Yu Mi invite you!
Surprise Pool Party!!</i>

185
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,494
<i>Unni!</i>

186
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,810
You came.

187
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,600
Been well?

188
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,440
That's good, because I had
something to report to you.

189
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,830
Report?

190
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,260
Seems that Oppa doesn't remember you after all.

191
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,870
Really?

192
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,480
Also, one more thing.

193
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:13,430
I hate to say this to you,
but Yu Mi likes Jun Pyo oppa.

194
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,780
What?

195
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,240
It wasn't on purpose.  But
somehow, I came to like him.

196
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,046
<i>To the point that I can't be separated from him.</i>

197
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,480
Oppa feels the same way as Yu Mi.

198
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,530
Sorry.

199
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,190
But you understand, don't you?

200
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,150
A person's heart, by its nature, doesn't
always do what we want it to do.

201
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,920
Oh... it's already that time.

202
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,370
I have to tell everyone the
reason for tonight's party.

203
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,960
Reason?

204
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,820
Unni, come over in a bit, OK?

205
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,740
Don't break down here.

206
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,090
Let's go.

207
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,210
And hear whatever it is.

208
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,350
We had special news to tell everyone.
That's why we asked you to come tonight.

209
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,240
<i>Gu Jun Pyo and Jang Yu Mi.</i>

210
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,490
The two of us have decided to go together
next month to study abroad in America.

211
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,670
<i>What?</i>

212
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,260
<i>What's that girl talking about?</i>

213
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,380
Study abroad?

214
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,840
I will continue with my harp studies.

215
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,297
<i>And Oppa will study business administration.</i>

216
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,850
<i>During the time that we can't see
each other, please don't be too sad.</i>

217
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,090
<i>And until we meet again, please be happy.</i>

218
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,540
Looks like she's is no ordinary girl.

219
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,700
She's cunning, stabbing us in the back like this.

220
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,070
Let's go.

221
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,570
I'll get you a glass of warm water.

222
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,410
Gu Jun Pyo!

223
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,680
Do you remember this?

224
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,890
What's that?

225
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,790
The names on this... you don't remember?

226
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,480
"JJ"?

227
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,600
How am I supposed to know this?

228
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,530
I'll give it back.

229
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,570
Take it.

230
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,600
Why would I take something like this?

231
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,346
If you want to throw it away, do it yourself.

232
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,320
Fine.

233
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,520
Gu Jun Pyo.

234
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,410
Just one thing...

235
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,260
I'll ask you just one more thing.

236
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,250
Now what?

237
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,200
Do you know how to swim?

238
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,710
Swim?

239
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,050
I don't do things like swimming.

240
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,720
Don't or can't?

241
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,830
Because of a bad memory from childhood,

242
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,100
I don't swim.  I never learned how.

243
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,320
No.

244
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,460
You know how to swim.

245
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,430
Who are you?

246
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,610
What do you think you know
about me, to go on like this?

247
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:22,310
You're not scared of anything in this world,
but bugs make you shudder.

248
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:30,100
Rather than have one finger on his girlfriend broken,
you're the idiot who prefers to have his ribs ripped out.

249
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,040
Even though you can't tell the difference
between "privacy" and "pride",

250
00:26:35,418 --> 00:26:41,840
You're the ignoramus who insists that there are
38 strategies, loudly as if you ate a train's heart*.

251
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:41,840
<i>{\a6}*referring to one of his past misquotes</i>

252
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,450
You say that you hate kids.

253
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:50,447
But with your own son,

254
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,104
You want to see the stars with him,

255
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:55,568
<i>and be an attentive father.</i>

256
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,270
You're a lonely guy with much affection.

257
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,100
What are you?

258
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,830
That's precisely you... Gu Jun Pyo.

259
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,810
I'm asking what the hell your point is!

260
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,940
Call it out.

261
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:12,940
My name.

262
00:27:14,018 --> 00:27:19,489
<i>Do we not have another chance?</i>

263
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:26,426
<i>I still think about you.</i>

264
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:33,698
<i>But you probably don't know that.</i>

265
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,971
<i>Ultimately, is this it?</i>

266
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,400
<i>Are we going to end like this?</i>

267
00:27:43,492 --> 00:27:47,867
<i>Is this fine with you?</i>

268
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:53,142
<i>I don't think that I can make it.</i>

269
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:56,304
<i>A love like yours</i>

270
00:27:57,408 --> 00:28:03,493
<i>Even if I die, I don't think that I'll have it again.</i>

271
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:05,503
<i>What do I do?</i>

272
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:12,430
<i>If my heart isn't yours, then
there's no one who can hold it.</i>

273
00:28:13,004 --> 00:28:17,504
<i>Please, hold onto me.</i>

274
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:26,399
<i>You know that no matter
how much I try, I can't erase you.</i>

275
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:31,299
<i>Please, hold onto me.</i>

276
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,630
<i>What do I do?</i>

277
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:40,286
<i>Even now, I live each day
broken by your single word.</i>

278
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:45,398
<i>Tell me.</i>

279
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:49,063
<i>If being like this is wrong.</i>

280
00:28:49,704 --> 00:28:54,344
<i>Like me, are you living each day in pain?</i>

281
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,048
<i>Tell me.</i>

282
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:59,127
<i>You and me.</i>

283
00:29:00,098 --> 00:29:04,490
<i>Is it already too late?</i>

284
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:10,905
<i>Do we not have another chance?</i>

285
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:13,822
Jan Di...

286
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,230
Geum Jan Di.

287
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,560
Jan Di!

288
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:34,064
<i>Even though I tell it not to go.</i>

289
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,645
<i>Even though I tell it to stop.</i>

290
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,927
<i>My heart keeps going towards you.</i>

291
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,306
<i>It doesn't wear out.</i>

292
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,527
<i>It doesn't decrease.</i>

293
00:29:45,974 --> 00:29:50,287
<i>Why is my love like this?</i>

294
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:54,899
<i>One by one, I count and count the memories.</i>

295
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,376
<i>My heart can't rest for even a moment.</i>

296
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:03,813
<i>Like baggage which becomes hard to control,</i>

297
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,570
<i>Why can't I even throw them away?</i>

298
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,040
<i>Hey, Geum Jan Di.</i>

299
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,140
Wake up!

300
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,798
<i>Really, something must've happened to my heart.</i>

301
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:17,289
<i>I must've become a fool blinded by love.</i>

302
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:21,815
<i>Just one place, every day one place.</i>

303
00:30:21,935 --> 00:30:26,046
<i>Looking at the sad light that is you.</i>

304
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,623
Jan Di.

305
00:30:29,612 --> 00:30:30,318
Geum Jan Di!

306
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:35,123
<i>My tears won't stop.</i>

307
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:40,307
<i>Just one thing... just that you love me.</i>

308
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:44,322
<i>Can't you tell me?</i>

309
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,360
Are you OK?

310
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,500
Do you remember now?

311
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,180
Geum Jan Di.

312
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,040
Scare a person like that again
and youll really be dead!

313
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,800
You do remember.

314
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,700
Im sorry.

315
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm sorry.

316
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,300
Say it again... my name.

317
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,240
Jan Di.

318
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:29,101
<i>Even my tear glands must be broken.</i>

319
00:31:29,102 --> 00:31:33,593
<i>My tears won't stop.</i>

320
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:38,625
<i>Just one thing... your heart, that one thing.</i>

321
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:42,913
<i>Can't you share it with me?</i>

322
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:49,079
<i>Can't you love me?</i>

323
00:31:57,176 --> 00:31:58,782
<i>Shinhwa High!</i>

324
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:00,640
<i>Shinhwa High!</i>

325
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,498
<i>Shinhwa High!</i>

326
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,640
Seems like only yesterday you entered
high school but you're already graduating.

327
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:13,590
I'm sorry, Mom.

328
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:17,846
Unlike others, I cant get a job or go to college.

329
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,885
Noona, you don't have to take
a test for Shinhwa University.

330
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,490
It's not the same for the medical school?

331
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,190
In order to get a scholarship, you have to take the test.

332
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,420
No, your life has been so complicated.

333
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,100
Now, do what you want to do.

334
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,200
Anyway, what are you going to wear
to the graduation party tomorrow?

335
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,850
I'm not going!

336
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,370
Why should I?

337
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,460
What?

338
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,160
Aren't you a Shinhwa High graduating student?

339
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,580
Why aren't you going?

340
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,350
Please don't worry about it.

341
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,110
<i>Come outside for a little bit.</i>

342
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,170
Congrats on graduating.

343
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,540
Thanks.

344
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,670
Do you really have to go to medical school?

345
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,480
Why? What are you going to say now?

346
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,350
With your head, there's no guarantee
that studying for another year will help.

347
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,280
There's none.

348
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,440
Even if it did, what if there really were a doctor like you?

349
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,890
You'd probably cut people up.

350
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,200
What?

351
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,863
What, am I wrong?

352
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:47,655
Even if you don't have a scalpel, you still cut people.

353
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,922
You...

354
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,310
You're not here to congratulate me on graduating, right?

355
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,210
You came to aggravate me, right?

356
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,200
Oh, what?

357
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,095
Hey, Geum Jan Di.

358
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,657
Tomorrow...

359
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,920
Got it?

360
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,460
If you're late this time also, you're dead.

361
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,310
Go in and go to sleep.

362
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,267
Oh, it's F4.

363
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:16,903
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

364
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,951
<i>It's really them.</i>

365
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,840
Grandfather.

366
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,820
Hmm?

367
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,960
After I throw out the garbage, I'll get your tea.

368
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,740
Oh, you do that.

369
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,140
That little rascal is really

370
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,190
She's here.

371
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,778
Geum Jan Di.

372
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:21,393
Why did you come so late?

373
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,000
Well, I was

374
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,644
Surely, you weren't planning to just
skip this last event, were you?

375
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:34,230
We're not even in high school,
so why do you think we're here?

376
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,620
Huh?

377
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,490
The great F4 have waited all day
to dance with Geum Jan Di.

378
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,731
Miss Jan Di.

379
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:50,679
Will you do me the great honor of dancing with me?

380
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,090
Me?

381
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,840
Let's go.

382
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,550
Wait, hold on a minute.

383
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:31,072
<i>Of the F4, always strong and considerate,
who was like the elder, Woo Bin sunbae.</i>

384
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:38,050
<i>You were always one step behind,
offering others your help and support.</i>

385
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,200
<i>I know that now.</i>

386
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,770
<i>Although you act cold and mean,</i>

387
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,720
<i>You're actually warmer and
more innocent than the others.</i>

388
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,200
<i>Thanks to you, Yi Jung sunbae, I think
Ga Eul has become a really lovable woman.</i>

389
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,260
Isn't it about time for you to give her up?

390
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,630
Rascal.

391
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,330
What do I do? When my clothes are like this?

392
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,850
It's perfect.

393
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,250
Geum Jan Di's clothing style.

394
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:40,307
To end your high school career,
don't you think it's the best?

395
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,450
<i>Like Alice falling into a strange land,</i>

396
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,670
<i>If I went to the emergency exit,
then I could meet you, Sunbae.</i>

397
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,740
<i>Do you know what a huge comfort
that was to me, Sunbae?</i>

398
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,750
<i>You were like someone sent from heaven, like a bonus.</i>

399
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,990
<i>I'll never be able to forget you.</i>

400
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,420
<i>My soulmate</i>

401
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,270
<i>Ji Hoo sunbae.</i>

402
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,150
<i>Thank you.</i>

403
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,650
What happened to Jun Pyo?

404
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,953
And his phone is turned off.

405
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:48,580
What if something happened again?

406
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,870
You, tomorrow...

407
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,020
Got it?

408
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,720
Saturday.  4pm.  In front of Nam San Tower.

409
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,050
I... have to leave first.

410
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,760
Seriously!  To the very end, this crazy bastard...

411
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,260
Geum Jan Di!

412
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:25,014
<i>I didn't know that I'd be like this.</i>

413
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:35,336
<i>Flustered, carefully, I keep calling only you.</i>

414
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:39,810
<i>Even if you urge my heart like this,</i>

415
00:41:42,245 --> 00:41:46,259
<i>If you brush by my side,</i>

416
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:51,472
<i>And also laugh like that, I can't do anything.</i>

417
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,342
<i>Didn't I say that if you're late, you're dead?</i>

418
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,810
Do you want to be late even on a day like today?

419
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,580
You always do whatever you want.

420
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:09,390
<i>I laugh by myself.</i>

421
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:14,574
<i>On a night like tonight, what do I do?</i>

422
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,346
<i>I wish you're my love. </i>

423
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:24,385
<i>Come to me now.</i>

424
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:29,412
<i>Without knowing it, I get excited.</i>

425
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:34,525
<i>Today, I'm like this again.</i>

426
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,740
It's not some kind of magic.

427
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,430
This kind of thing...

428
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,700
is quite easy.

429
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,460
Compared to taking care of the lawn*.

430
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,460
<i>*wordplay: JAN DI baht = lawn</i>

432
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,430

<i>The only person to whom I'll promise forever...</i>

434
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:59,718
<i>... is you.</i>

435
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,560
This coffee costs 36,300 Won, so enjoy it.

436
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,930
Let's go.

437
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,230
It's been a really long time, huh?

438
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,881
But...

439
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:27,620
This place isn't open?

440
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,990
How come I don't see anyone?

441
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,220
I rented it.

442
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,180
What?

443
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,130
I bought it until morning.

444
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,330
Oh, yeah.  I have something to show you.

445
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,480
- Come here.
- No.

446
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,780
- I said there's something I have to show you.
- No!

447
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,010
What's wrong with you?
There's something I want to show...

448
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,850
You already knew?

449
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,404
You!

450
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:09,180
Did you do this so that I can't get married?

451
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,540
You just need to marry me.
Who else are you going to marry?

452
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,950
Move over.

453
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,610
I said, just move over!

454

<i>Gu Jun Pyo loves Geum Jan Di.

It's still here.

456
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,179
Now, you can't get married.

457
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,020
Geum Jan Di.

458
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,440
From here on, listen carefully to what I say.

459
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,908
That's scary

460
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,613
What now?

461
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,660
We

462
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,710
Let's get married.

463
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,010
Married?

464
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,060
Yeah.

465
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:57,292
Married.

466
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,540
Why are you suddenly joking around like this?

467
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,420
I'm not joking.

468
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,280
I just graduated from high school, you know.

469
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,730
I...

470
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,600
Have to go to America.

471
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,250
America?

472
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:23,780
This time, not because of my mom.

473
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,440
And not because of the company.

474
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,570
I made the decision.

475
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:47,130
Killing off a perfectly fine father...

476
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,680
Forcibly marrying off her children.

477
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,821
<i>And lobbying all the time to survive.
I don't want that kind of corporation.</i>

478
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,770
I'm...

479
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,400
Going to do my best.

480
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,960
So...

481
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:07,205
If I can save the company, then that's a relief.

482
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,990
But if I can't...

483
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,310
Then I will shut it down with my own hands.

484
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,320
How long will it take?

485
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,960
4 years.

486
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,220
At least 4 years.

487
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,040
That long?

488
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,184
Which is why...

489
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:37,932
Come with me.

490
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:53,510
I can't.

491
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,110
What?

492
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,290
Why not?

493
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:10,670
When you went to Macau,

494
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,160
I made a decision too.

495
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,140
Regarding my dream and my future.

496
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,069
What I want...

497
00:47:27,189 --> 00:47:29,081
And what I want to do.

498
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,123

501
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,080
So?

502
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,440
Go.

503
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:49,360
What?

504
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,930
I said go.

505
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:00,760
After 4 years, if you come back
as a really amazing man,

506
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,250
then I'll think about it again.

514
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,720
But I already know.

515
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:45,820

00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:02,754
<i>Dazzling, always you're my star.</i>

538
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:05,937
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

539
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,769
<i>I can always you waiting for you.</i>

540
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:13,232
<i>What took you so long to come to me?</i>

541
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,849
<i>I feel like I have the world.</i>

542
00:51:19,704 --> 00:51:22,817
We'll change the topic a little now.

543
00:51:22,937 --> 00:51:30,141
The viewers, especially the women in Korea,
would like to hear some personal information.

544
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:35,222
Of course, you're managing an international company,
but you're also a bachelor in your 20s.

545
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,045
So I'm sure that you have had lonely moments.

546
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:40,166
How do you overcome that?

547
00:51:41,629 --> 00:51:47,191
Dating or love... It seems that you're
curious about these aspects of my life.

548
00:51:47,311 --> 00:51:49,874
You certainly have a faster
understanding of things than others.

549
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:51,905
Yes.

550
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,448
Well, I would be lying if I said that
there were no lonely or difficult times.

551
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,569
But because of a promise I made with someone,

552
00:52:01,947 --> 00:52:04,681
I was able to rely on that and endure.

553
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,110
Just watching you talk about it,

554
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:10,860
It seems that you have someone special in your heart.

555
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:12,707
Yes, well...

556
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:14,071
A lover... ?

557
00:52:14,191 --> 00:52:17,662
It's just that lately, there's been
a lot of rumors about your marriage.

558
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:18,916
Since you're already here,

559
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:22,665
Could you tell us a little about
what kind of person she is?

560
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:29,911
<i>I pray that you'll allow me.</i>

561
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:33,658
<i>Accept me as your man.</i>

562
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:40,858
<i>I promise you that, until the day
I die, my heart won't change.</i>

563
00:52:41,914 --> 00:52:45,692
<i>I can always you waiting for you.</i>

564
00:52:45,812 --> 00:52:49,157
<i>Baby, I will forever with you.</i>

565
00:52:49,495 --> 00:52:54,543
<i>Forever, I'll love only you.</i>

566
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:14,590
<i>Making it is easy.</i>

567
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:15,887
<i>Try making it.</i>

568
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:26,277
You're doing a good job.

569
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,236
- Is that a grape?
- Yes.

570
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:35,353
There's still too much pressure in your hands.

571
00:53:38,477 --> 00:53:40,053
Yi Jung sunbae.

572
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:41,923
Hi.

573
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:46,037
Who is he?

574
00:53:46,157 --> 00:53:48,281
Is he Teacher's boyfriend?

575
00:53:48,401 --> 00:53:51,705
Ahjusshi, by any chance, did you
come back from another country?

576
00:53:51,825 --> 00:53:53,663
Oh, how did you know?

577
00:53:53,783 --> 00:53:54,587
Then...

578
00:53:54,707 --> 00:53:56,565
Did you come back from Sweden?

579
00:53:57,247 --> 00:53:59,690
Little miss, you're really amazing.

580
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,262
Then you're him.

581
00:54:01,382 --> 00:54:06,991
Our teacher said that her boyfriend was there.

582
00:54:09,763 --> 00:54:11,083
You can't say that.

583
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:35,813
<i>Oh...</i>

584
00:54:35,933 --> 00:54:37,840
<i>Oh.  Wait!</i>

585
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,564
Wait! Wait!

586
00:54:40,684 --> 00:54:42,230
Thank you!

587
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:46,330
Hey, third year.  Late even on a day like today?

588
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,902
<i>Jeez, that's just like you.</i>

589
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:50,585
Not a day goes by without you causing trouble.

590
00:54:51,267 --> 00:54:52,862
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

591
00:54:53,413 --> 00:54:54,436
I'm sorry.

592
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,864
<i>Do you think it'll end just like that?</i>

593
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:14,019
Sunbae!

594
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:37,608
[Shinhwa University Medical School
Medical Care Service Corps]

595
00:55:40,745 --> 00:55:41,799
- Hey, Geum Jan Di!
- Yes!

596
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:43,724
Can't you do this properly?

597
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:44,681
<i>What is this?</i>

598
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:45,945
- I'm sorry.
- Do it again.

599
00:55:46,065 --> 00:55:47,253
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

600
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:18,572
You came?

601
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:30,930
By the look on your face, seems
like you made another mistake.

602
00:56:32,943 --> 00:56:36,795
Sunbae, since you entered on time,
you're already in the graduating class.

603
00:56:37,532 --> 00:56:39,073
When am I, a third year...

604
00:56:39,193 --> 00:56:43,775
Going to finish and in what
millennium will I become a doctor?

605
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:47,483
The future looks dark.

606
00:56:47,603 --> 00:56:49,439
And flunking out doesn't worry you?

607
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:51,111
Sunbae!

608
00:56:54,466 --> 00:56:56,188
It was because of you...

609
00:56:56,397 --> 00:56:59,180
That I didn't become an outcast.

610
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:02,667
When you go to the hospital, when I
think of what I'm going to do then,

611
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:05,065
The future looks dark.

612
00:57:05,185 --> 00:57:07,754
Then, should I repeat too?

613
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:10,163
Aigoo, that's alright.

614
00:57:10,581 --> 00:57:13,050
That's scarier than joking about flunking.

615
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:14,849
But I'm not joking.

616
00:57:17,379 --> 00:57:21,657
Sunbae, you have to hurry and become a doctor
and reopen your grandfather's clinic.

617
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,982
That's why you went back and studied hard.

618
00:57:27,213 --> 00:57:29,071
That wasn't the only reason.

619
00:57:29,973 --> 00:57:30,974
What?

620
00:57:32,404 --> 00:57:37,084
Doctor prince, my throat hurts.

621
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,625
Doctor prince?

622
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:43,511
Yeah.

623
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:49,911
Later, Sae Byul is going to marry Doctor prince.

624
00:57:52,056 --> 00:57:53,614
Sae Byul princess.

625
00:57:53,734 --> 00:57:54,978
You can get married next time.

626
00:57:55,098 --> 00:57:56,698
For now, say "ah".

627
00:58:03,691 --> 00:58:07,453
<i>Commoner, can you hear me?</i>

628
00:58:07,573 --> 00:58:09,707
<i>Geum Jan Di, respond.</i>

629
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,694
<i>Geum Jan Di, are you there?</i>

630
00:58:11,814 --> 00:58:13,784
<i>If so, hurry and come meet me on the beach.</i>

631
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:15,389
Gu Jun Pyo?

632
00:58:36,552 --> 00:58:38,003
Gu Jun Pyo?

633
00:58:50,254 --> 00:58:51,882
It took you 5 minutes!

634
00:58:52,002 --> 00:58:53,465
Can't you walk faster?

635
00:59:06,024 --> 00:59:07,497
Gu Jun Pyo.

636
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,184
What happened?

637
00:59:12,304 --> 00:59:13,783
What do you mean?

638
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,094
Gu Jun Pyo came to Geum Jan Di's office.

639
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:20,763
Wow.

640
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:23,161
Seeing you in a white gown...

641
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:26,008
I guess even an ugly duckling can become a crane.*

642
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:26,008
<i>*messes up another saying</i>

643
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:30,782
You are Gu Jun Pyo.

644
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,227
You really are Gu Jun Pyo.

645
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:46,736
I missed you.

646
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:48,936
To the point of death.

647
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:55,868
I'm not going to let go of you again.

648
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:04,204
You promised, didn't you?

649
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:06,437
That when I returned, you'd take responsibility for me.

650
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:11,860
Look here, Mr. Gu Jun Pyo with the bad memory.

651
01:00:12,366 --> 01:00:13,983
To be precise,

652
01:00:14,103 --> 01:00:17,250
I said that when you returned
in 4 years, I would think about it.

653
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:19,328
I didn't say that I would take responsibility for you.

654
01:00:21,997 --> 01:00:24,901
Your memory is bad too, but you remembered that well.

655
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,265
I recall...

656
01:00:26,385 --> 01:00:28,531
That there was another condition.

657
01:00:28,651 --> 01:00:29,542
What?

658
01:00:30,103 --> 01:00:34,340
About you coming back as a really amazing man.

659
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:38,002
Can you say that with the Gu Jun Pyo in front of you?

660
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:00,757
Geum Jan Di.

661
01:01:02,154 --> 01:01:05,718
Please marry this Gu Jun Pyo.

662
01:01:14,622 --> 01:01:16,551
I object to that proposal!

663
01:01:18,226 --> 01:01:19,920
I add to that objection.

664
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,327
Me too!

665
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:22,989
You two...

666
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:25,611
Without our permission, it's not
going to happen that easily.
