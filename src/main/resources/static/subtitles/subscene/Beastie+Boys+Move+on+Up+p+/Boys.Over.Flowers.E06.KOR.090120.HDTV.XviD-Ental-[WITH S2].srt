Episode 6

4
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:42,378
What's this about?

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,380
I've said before right?

6
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:48,896
You can enjoy things that you would
never have imagined before everyday now.

7
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:51,469
<i>{\a6}* (grass field)</i>

8
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:51,469
Jan Di Bahnt*, I thought you were really strong,

9
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,641
but you're actually very easily
touched by such insignificant things.

10
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:55,253
This is considered insignificant?

11
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:59,254
If you're done with being touched,
then let's move on to the main point.

12
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,017
Main point?

13
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,534
What do you think you're doing now?

14
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:14,491
Don't take your clothes off.

15
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:20,031
What is he up to?

16
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:26,965
I said not to take them off.
If you take off your clothes, you're dead!

17
00:01:30,768 --> 00:01:33,153
If you take off your pants,
you're really dead!

18
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:34,514
I said not to take off!

19
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:36,493
I already told you not to take them off!

20
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,369
He's still taking them off.

21
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:42,429
Hey!
I told you not to take them off!

22
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:44,301
Idiot.

23
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:53,518
- You're dead.
- Hurry come, idiot.

24
00:01:53,804 --> 00:01:54,867
Do you want to die?

25
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:56,723
Scared me!

26
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,348
Gu Jun Pyo.

27
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:08,400
Don't move.
Just stay still.

28
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:09,522
What's wrong?

29
00:02:09,523 --> 00:02:10,890
Don't move!

30
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,179
What is it?
What's wrong?

31
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:22,275
There's a snake under your feet.

32
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:23,711
What?

33
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:28,176
Under your feet!

34
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,651
Under your feet.
Snake!

35
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:35,494
I hate snakes the most!

36
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,357
You run quite fast, Gu Jun Pyo.

37
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:45,042
Continue running!

38
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,663
What's this?!

39
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,608
Run further!
You run quite well!

40
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:08,788
Madam, this is the rice
wine that you've ordered.

41
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,757
Place it over there.

42
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,393
Yes.

43
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,895
Please enjoy.

44
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:18,961
Tip.

45
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,225
Thank you, madam.

46
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,250
- Wait a moment.
- Yes, madam?

47
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:29,363
If you've got the time,
could you help me apply this?

48
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:32,254
This is my forte, ma'am.

49
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,361
<i>Mom!</i>

50
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:43,989
The chicken store ahjusshi said that,

51
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,938
if we aren't going to order fried chicken,
then we should quickly return the umbrella.

52
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,097
What?

53
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:53,995
The price of a fried chicken is enough to feed
our whole family a few bowls of chicken soup.

54
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,359
Take it away!
Take it away!

55
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,947
Honey, what about this?

56
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:04,183
Kang San.

57
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,144
Isn't our Kang San pretty?

58
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:09,607
Why are you doing that to him?

59
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,583
Do you want me to help you apply?

60
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,977
Forget it.

61
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:43,018
My baby totally has baby skin.

62
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,299
What's this?

63
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:51,980
Jan Di!
Jan Di!

64
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,788
Hey! Stop swimming!
Come out for a while!

65
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:07,878
Jan Di!
Stop swimming!

66
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,191
Seriously.

67
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,036
Hey!

68
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:19,946
Jan Di!

69
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,546
What's wrong with her?

70
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:22,788
Jan Di!

71
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:25,305
- What happened?
- Jan Di!

72
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:29,230
How?

73
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,418
What's this?
What's wrong?

74
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,523
Something's wrong with Jan Di.

75
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:35,494
She has leg cramps!

76
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:51,744
Jan Di!

77
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,185
Jan Di, wake up!

78
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:00,789
Can you hear me?

79
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,031
Chairman.

80
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:48,950
Where did Jun Pyo go?

81
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:53,109
According to the report from the private jet
that took off at 5pm, he went to New Caledonia.

82
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,315
Whatever for?

83
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:57,859
Most probably to relax over the weekend.

84
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,066
OK.

85
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,158
Wait a moment.

86
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:06,735
Have you confirmed who went with him?

87
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:12,671
As always, with his F4 friends.

88
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:19,393
F4 again. When is he going to stop
being the leader of this childish group?

89
00:08:21,695 --> 00:08:23,221
You may go.

90
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:01,419
<i>Save me!</i>

91
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,821
<i>Mom!</i>

92
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,423
<i>Dad!</i>

93
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,255
<i>Noona!</i>

94
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:08,002
<i>Save me!</i>

95
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:15,558
<i>Why would such a great person
like him not know how to swim?</i>

96
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,245
<i>He was kidnapped when he was eight.</i>

97
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,401
<i>What?</i>

98
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:21,999
<i>When he was young, his parents
entrusted him to the care of a hyung.</i>

99
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,055
<i>He was a bodyguard and a driver.</i>

100
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,527
<i>You're saying,
that person was his kidnapper?</i>

101
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,229
<i>The car that was surrounded by the police
was driven into the water eventually.</i>

102
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,404
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

103
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,191
<i>That's right.
Jun Pyo was inside the car then.</i>

104
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:43,086
<i>Is everything OK?</i>

105
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:44,530
OK.

106
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:06,958
What's this about?

107
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,815
I especially prepared this for you guys.

108
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:12,881
Doesn't seem it like. It seems like
you prepared this for a special someone.

109
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,067
What does it matter?

110
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:16,129
It looks delicious.

111
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,380
Come here.

112
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:19,694
Why?
Let go.

113
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,224
It hurts!

114
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,848
Eat everything here.

115
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,170
Do you think of me as Godzilla?

116
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,095
It's good for your body, so eat more.

117
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:34,472
You're eating those weird worms everyday.

118
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:36,985
That's why your leg cramped up.

119
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:38,595
Strange worms?

120
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:39,765
In any case,

121
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:42,534
does it make sense for
a swimmer to almost drown?

122
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:44,961
A sudden cramp can happen anytime.

123
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,561
<i>{\a6}*(rat and cramp sound the same in Korean)</i>

124
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,561
Whether is it a rat or a cat,

125
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,645
I can't stand seeing people
around me being so weak.

126
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:52,616
So don't talk so much, just eat.
You hear me?

127
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:00,342
How are you?

128
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:04,048
Your girlfriend is not with you?

129
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:10,036
This is for your girlfriend.

130
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:50,033
Are you going to finish that all?

131
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,751
Jun Pyo doesn't like fat girls.

132
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:56,335
What?

133
00:12:56,548 --> 00:13:01,124
But, the sleepwear that I brought
along should be of some help.

134
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:03,522
Sleepwear?

135
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,335
Though he is completely into Jan Di now,

136
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:09,921
you should never belittle his character.

137
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,315
What are you saying now?

138
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:15,362
Men who have been
rejected are very vulnerable.

139
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,625
I think it's worth giving it a shot.

140
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:22,991
What in the world are you talking about now?

141
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,098
Don't you like Jun Pyo?

142
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:29,397
Ridiculous.

143
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:33,448
Excuse me, I'm a person
with standards too, alright?

144
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:37,771
Then just now, you said that Jun Pyo
and Jan Di may cause trouble.

145
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:39,927
Why were you so sensitive?

146
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:48,067
Don't tell me, you like Jan Di?

147
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:51,428
That's because Jan Di has
someone else in her mind!

148
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,226
Hey, hey, hey.

149
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:01,145
So Yi Jung, hurry come here.

150
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:03,114
Hurry.

151
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,151
Show time!

152
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:14,875
Gu Jun Pyo, from today onwards,
I allow you to enter the player list.

153
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,823
What is she doing in there?

154
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:13,370
Hey!
I thought you fainted in there!

155
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,071
You aren't old fashioned till you scrub your body.

156
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:16,465
Why did you take so long?

157
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:18,092
You!

158
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:28,904
This fella's asking to die!
He'll die today!

159
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:33,403
This is not your room.
It's my room!

160
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:34,739
Who said it isn't yours?

161
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,684
Then why are you here?

162
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:40,114
Have you seen me come and go with a purpose?

163
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:42,529
Purpose?

164
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:44,465
What purpose?

165
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:53,455
You're losing something important.

166
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:56,300
Important?

167
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,988
As a woman...

168
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:01,053
As a woman.

169
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,158
Is it…

170
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,673
Gu Jun Pyo.
What in the world are you...

171
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:28,303
Cheap stuff really does fit you well.

172
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:35,603
You came here to give me this?

173
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:39,619
Then? Did you think that
I'd do something to you?

174
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,533
If the girl doesn't like me in return,
I won't touch her.

175
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,652
Close your doors tight before you sleep.
Lizards may crawl in.

176
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:56,817
It may be cheap but if you lose it,
you're dead!

177
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,477
Ga Eul, are you asleep?

178
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,802
Ga Eul, are you asleep?

179
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:46,409
Ga Eul!

180
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:54,709
Do you know what lily of the valley means?

181
00:19:56,023 --> 00:20:01,036
You'll definitely be happy.

182
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:08,706
So, it's for lovers to give each other.

183
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:11,726
You know about it?

184
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:15,303
At the market, earlier today.

185
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:19,851
I used to come here
frequently with that person.

186
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:24,256
She said it's very similar to
New Zealand and likes it here.

187
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:27,022
Is she doing well?

188
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:32,834
She should be.

189
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,809
Did something happen?

190
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:43,243
Why did you ask me to go after her?

191
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,710
That…

192
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:50,602
I finally realized.

193
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:54,179
What a pathetic man I am.

194
00:20:54,479 --> 00:21:03,543
There was nothing for me to do but
wait all day in an empty apartment.

195
00:21:04,734 --> 00:21:08,670
But, just spending time together
would've been very blissful.

196
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,673
Do you know what it's like being nothing
but a burden to the woman you love?

197
00:21:17,954 --> 00:21:21,794
You called them pathetic fools who
can't do anything on their own.

198
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:22,821
That was...

199
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:24,587
You're right.

200
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:36,589
I can't do anything other than
love one woman like a habit.

201
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,359
What a pathetic fool.

202
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:47,610
Take it.

203
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,418
I don't want to.

204
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,608
This is meant for Seo Hyun unni.

205
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:58,561
Sunbae should give it to her personally.

206
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:05,121
I'm leaving.

207
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:08,836
You shouldn't stay out here for too long.
You'll catch a cold.

208
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,354
It's cold.

209
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:26,538
It's so cold, I can't take it.

210
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:20,116
You should've told me if you were going
somewhere! You got me all worried!

211
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:24,192
Am I a kid?

212
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:27,380
I can go for a walk by myself!
What's wrong?

213
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:30,694
I was afraid that you fell into the pool
or got bitten by a snake or something!

214
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:32,663
How can I not worry?

215
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,280
Gu Jun Pyo.

216
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:43,085
I'm sorry.

217
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:53,630
You.

218
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,758
From now on, don't go swimming by yourself.

219
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:02,979
Don't walk around by yourself too.

220
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,852
Got it?

221
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,589
Why?

222
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,892
Oh?

223
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,739
It's hot.
Be careful.

224
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,267
Do you want some too?

225
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:34,099
No, it's okay.

226
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:44,404
Where is it?

227
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:45,466
What?

228
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:47,202
The thing I gave you.

229
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:50,450
Oh, that…

230
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:52,864
It's in my room.

231
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:57,296
I'm afraid that I'd lose it when I'm outside.
Would you let me off if I do?

232
00:26:58,594 --> 00:27:00,140
It's alright if you know.

233
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:08,232
Hold it tight.

234
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:10,608
Hold it more.

235
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,655
Mine!

236
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:38,329
OK!

237
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,193
What's that?
It doesn't suit you.

238
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:33,826
Really?

239
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,219
I liked it.

240
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:39,847
What?

241
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:41,377
It's Jan Di's.

242
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,825
She dropped it last night.
Return it to her.

243
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,365
Play ball!

244
00:28:58,365 --> 00:28:59,882
Jun Pyo!
Why aren't you playing?

245
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:07,205
Shit.

246
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:12,160
<i>Am I a kid?</i>

247
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,085
I can go for a walk by myself!
What's wrong?

248
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:18,581
<i>Oh, that…</i>

249
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:21,126
It's in my room.

250
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:25,257
I'm afraid that I'd lose it when I'm outside.
Would you let me off if I do?

251
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,222
<i>Jun Pyo!
The ball!</i>

252
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:37,465
Jun Pyo!
Are you OK?

253
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:38,767
Are you alright?

254
00:29:38,998 --> 00:29:42,247
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

255
00:29:47,312 --> 00:29:48,781
Hey!

256
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:52,217
Where did Ji Hoo go?

257
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,159
Over there.

258
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:16,641
Are you going somewhere?

259
00:33:17,345 --> 00:33:18,330
Fishing.

260
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:19,671
With this boat?

261
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:25,159
So long as there's a white sail and wind,
I can go anywhere I want to.

262
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:30,678
Do you want to come along?

263
00:33:30,904 --> 00:33:32,046
Can I?

264
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:36,171
If you promise to be quiet
and not scare the fish off.

265
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:13,515
You let it go.

266
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:14,940
You're just going to let it go?

267
00:34:15,164 --> 00:34:20,079
Can you bear to eat a fish
that lives in a place like this?

268
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:27,607
Goodbye, fish!

269
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,572
Bye!

270
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:06,887
You're trying really hard.

271
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,279
Why do you keep following me?

272
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,604
It'd be hard to paddle alone.

273
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:40,916
Though your legs do seem strong enough.

274
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,448
So,

275
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:53,344
shall we continue with what
we were saying last night?

276
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:55,777
What were we saying?

277
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:59,198
You said that Geum Jan Di likes another guy.

278
00:35:59,513 --> 00:36:01,154
Is that true?

279
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:04,464
Since when did I say such a thing?

280
00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:07,192
Who is it?

281
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:10,855
Stop saying all that useless stuff.
Paddle properly!

282
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:15,065
I'm sure he's the bad boy type.

283
00:36:15,586 --> 00:36:17,784
I understand women very well.

284
00:36:17,987 --> 00:36:22,537
Girls like Geum Jan Di
have a thing for bad boys.

285
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:28,628
It must be that kind who wants to depend on
strong women and take advantage of them.

286
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:30,066
That's not it!

287
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:34,145
That person may very
well be Jan Di's soulmate.

288
00:36:40,692 --> 00:36:42,285
Soulmate?

289
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:44,961
That's why I say women can't make it.

290
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,643
Do you really believe in those things?

291
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:51,003
Yes, of course.

292
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:54,462
Playboys like you can't understand,

293
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:58,852
but there is such a thing as a true
love who stays with you all your life.

294
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:04,455
So, have you met your lifetime match?

295
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:06,585
Not yet.

296
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:11,021
But when he shows up, I won't let go,

297
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:18,252
because I'd regret losing someone
like that for the rest of my life.

298
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:26,349
Why aren't you paddling?

299
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,126
I've been paddling by myself.

300
00:38:02,165 --> 00:38:03,833
<i>Where are we going?</i>

301
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,271
<i>I've something to show you.</i>

302
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:46,223
There, look down now.

303
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:59,159
<i>Wow, it's a heart.</i>

304
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:02,548
It's really shaped like a heart.

305
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:08,713
I told myself that when I found a girl
whom I like, I must bring her here.

306
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:19,862
Did you see?
My heart?

307
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:47,462
What's up?

308
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:49,713
Ji Hoo's in an emergency.

309
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,295
Look.

310
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:00,841
It says that he's of a
strong political background.

311
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:04,952
I heard that he's a strong candidate
of the next Prime Minister election.

312
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:08,140
Ji Hoo seemed to know about it even
before he returned from Paris.

313
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:09,905
I didn't see him the whole afternoon.

314
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:12,872
His luggage is still in his room though.

315
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:14,497
What should we do?

316
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:17,003
He'll be alright.

317
00:40:17,268 --> 00:40:19,122
I know him.

318
00:40:31,177 --> 00:40:35,591
Now I understand why your prince was dumped.

319
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,283
Ga Eul,

320
00:40:38,748 --> 00:40:40,156
what should I do?

321
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:42,063
What?

322
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:46,235
What I said came really came true.

323
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:52,579
Ji Hoo sunbae must be really angry with me.

324
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,523
<i>Though this is just my imagination,</i>

325
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:10,263
<i>I hope she marries someone of a royal
status or someone who may become president.</i>

326
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:17,105
Like Diana or Audrey Hepburn,
be a princess who contributes to world peace.

327
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,564
Something like that.

328
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:23,405
She's just a model.

329
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:26,053
<i>Why?</i>

330
00:41:26,054 --> 00:41:30,427
<i>Didn't the French president
divorce his wife to be with a model?</i>

331
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,765
Who would know?

332
00:41:31,766 --> 00:41:35,247
Maybe the next president of
France or some Prince in Europe

333
00:41:35,467 --> 00:41:39,336
will fall in love with Unni at first
sight and ask for her hand in marriage.

334
00:41:51,762 --> 00:41:53,656
How did you come in?

335
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:57,179
Did you forget who
the owner of this place is?

336
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,532
Geum Jan Di.

337
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,842
My heart... have you accepted it?

338
00:42:19,296 --> 00:42:21,126
What?

339
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,579
Don't make me wait for too long.

340
00:43:20,924 --> 00:43:23,029
Is it true?

341
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,812
It's just a rumour right?

342
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:29,238
It was reported wrongly right?

343
00:43:32,749 --> 00:43:34,701
I'm sorry.

344
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:37,550
I really didn't...

345
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:42,842
It seems like you understand her better than I do.

346
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:45,062
Sunbae.

347
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:48,732
He's someone who is very
compatible with Seo Hyun.

348
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:51,280
I would never be able to compare with him.

349
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:52,936
It's not like that.

350
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:55,324
It can't be like that.

351
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,438
Please, be happy.

352
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:24,655
Please tell me that you'll be happy.

353
00:44:30,778 --> 00:44:33,249
If Sunbae's suffering,

354
00:44:33,533 --> 00:44:36,002
I'll suffer too.

355
00:44:37,277 --> 00:44:40,531
Why didn't I like a girl like you?

356
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:24,855
Eventually, this is it?

357
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:36,134
Gu Jun Pyo.
Don't be like this.

358
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:38,417
- This is...
- What is this?

359
00:45:38,637 --> 00:45:40,728
This is something you don't know?

360
00:45:40,729 --> 00:45:43,274
You fell into a trap again?

361
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,588
I wanted to believe you.

362
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:53,265
I didn't want to misunderstand you again.

363
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:55,690
I tried my hardest.

364
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:00,139
I'm sorry.

365
00:46:00,712 --> 00:46:01,470
That…

366
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,290
I showed you my sincerity.

367
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:10,419
But, this is your answer?

368
00:46:11,988 --> 00:46:13,755
It's not like that.

369
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:15,300
It's not like that.

370
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:25,895
It's really over now.

371
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,242
Geum Jan Di.

372
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,287
Don't act like you know me anymore.

373
00:46:37,737 --> 00:46:38,500
Jun Pyo!

374
00:46:38,501 --> 00:46:40,446
Shut up!

375
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:47,492
If you say one more word,

376
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,740
I'll kill you.

377
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:20,970
What did he take?

378
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:22,676
What time?

379
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,853
Oh.

380
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:25,301
What?

381
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,914
I get it.

382
00:47:28,235 --> 00:47:30,551
So what?
He really left?

383
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,788
Yes. He took the plane
off early in the morning.

384
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,260
Crazy fella.

385
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,726
What is the reason this time?

386
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:40,445
Geum Jan Di.

387
00:47:41,128 --> 00:47:42,988
You really can't think of any reason?

388
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:35,764
I'm back.

389
00:48:38,437 --> 00:48:39,951
Jan Di!

390
00:48:40,393 --> 00:48:43,889
Jan Di, it's been hard on you right?

391
00:48:44,217 --> 00:48:45,464
My daughter!

392
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:48,468
How is it that your first trip overseas
was to the South on a private jet?

393
00:48:48,685 --> 00:48:50,965
What great fortune is this?

394
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,552
You've suffered, my daughter.

395
00:48:53,953 --> 00:48:58,951
Looking at you with such accomplishment,
I can die without regrets.

396
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:00,090
Why should you die?

397
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:01,497
This is just the beginning.

398
00:49:01,715 --> 00:49:03,142
When Jan Di becomes part of that family,

399
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:06,927
we should enjoy some of the riches,
then we can have no regrets.

400
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:08,243
I have a lot of regrets.

401
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,439
Dear.

402
00:49:09,703 --> 00:49:12,565
Noona, I heard that the island
belongs to Jun Pyo's family.

403
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,075
Really?

404
00:49:14,282 --> 00:49:15,254
That island is theirs?

405
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,532
How is it that the Shinhwa
Group owns so many things?

406
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:18,778
He's totally like a king.

407
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:22,252
King? Then, when our Jan Di marries him,
what would she be?

408
00:49:22,515 --> 00:49:24,098
Queen, of course.

409
00:49:24,346 --> 00:49:25,982
Oh, queen.

410
00:49:26,985 --> 00:49:29,208
Please calm down, bubu-in.

411
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:30,752
I'm bubu-in?

412
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:33,293
Dad, Dad, then what am I?

413
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:38,378
Whenever I watch Sageuks, it's always the
Majesty's brother that causes trouble.

414
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:41,538
Geum Kang San! You watch out!

415
00:49:41,738 --> 00:49:43,083
Heard me?

416
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:45,289
Such a thing would never happen.

417
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:46,636
Why?

418
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,547
That family and I...

419
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:53,540
No, I mean, Gu Jun Pyo and I will
not have any relationship in future.

420
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:00,299
Please wake up from your dreams!

421
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:07,471
This girl!

422
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:09,344
Why is she…

423
00:50:54,146 --> 00:50:55,697
That…

424
00:50:55,962 --> 00:50:57,292
It's pretty, right?

425
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,537
I bought this from the market.

426
00:51:00,538 --> 00:51:04,473
It's supposed to be given to the person
you want to spend your life with.

427
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:08,146
Maybe it's like asking them not to run away.

428
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,822
Don't drink without me around.

429
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:51,388
If it's snowing, you should go indoors!
Are you a statue?

430
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:53,521
I thought you'd come!

431
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,176
This is the first time in my life
that I'm waiting for someone.

432
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:07,043
It's a heart!

433
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:10,020
Did you see?
My heart?

434
00:52:13,835 --> 00:52:15,659
I'm sorry.

435
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:19,149
Sorry, Gu Jun Pyo.

436
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:23,176
Sorry.

437
00:52:29,443 --> 00:52:30,675
Sit down.

438
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,210
Don't need to look like that.

439
00:52:37,178 --> 00:52:39,262
You're in an emergency situation too.

440
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,635
But then again, you're
always in such a situation.

441
00:52:48,324 --> 00:52:50,261
I'm sorry about what happened on the island.

442
00:52:50,262 --> 00:52:51,898
What should you apologize?

443
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:54,127
If I didn't go and find you...

444
00:52:54,353 --> 00:52:56,115
That's what I wanted to say.

445
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:58,613
The person who should apologize is me.

446
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:02,897
It was me who hurt Gu Jun Pyo.

447
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:28,446
Jun Pyo should be like that now right?

448
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:31,740
No.

449
00:53:41,175 --> 00:53:44,429
His expression would be this black.

450
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:47,975
His face wouldn't be straight.

451
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:53,831
His hair would be so curly.

452
00:54:18,836 --> 00:54:20,697
I'm sorry.

453
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,859
It's alright.

454
00:55:05,037 --> 00:55:09,506
In the name of F4,
I have something to announce.

455
00:55:12,794 --> 00:55:17,348
Yoon Ji Hoo is no longer part of F4 anymore.

456
00:55:17,745 --> 00:55:19,011
What?

457
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,676
Jun Pyo.

458
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:30,474
And, in a week from now, Yoon Ji Hoo and
Geum Jan Di will be expelled from this school.

459
00:55:56,949 --> 00:55:57,842
Expel?

460
00:55:57,843 --> 00:55:58,912
That's right. Expel.

461
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,414
Don't you know what that means?

462
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:01,531
Quit school!

463
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:05,039
It doesn't make a difference for
a person like you to quit school.

464
00:56:05,249 --> 00:56:08,560
But because of you,
Ji Hoo sunbae was kicked out of F4!

465
00:56:08,561 --> 00:56:10,041
How are you going to
take responsibility for that?

466
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:13,791
Ever since your entered our school,
problems keep cropping up.

467
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:17,728
It's the first time that Ji Hoo and Jun Pyo
sunbae have seen such a poor person like you,

468
00:56:17,948 --> 00:56:21,354
so they pity you.

469
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:23,195
It's because they're all too kind.

470
00:56:23,196 --> 00:56:24,555
Take responsibility.

471
00:56:24,556 --> 00:56:29,405
It's because of an ignorant girl
like you that our F4 is split up.

472
00:56:29,406 --> 00:56:31,840
You need to take
responsibility for all of this!

473
00:56:32,061 --> 00:56:34,088
I'll take the responsibility.

474
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,570
How should I take responsibility?

475
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,354
Sunbae.

476
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,684
Please wake up.

477
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,695
Aren't you people the
ones who need to wake up?

478
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,139
Ignorant girl?

479
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,621
Saying that make you seem ignorant!

480
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,987
Sunbae!

481
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:01,853
If you act like this,
we can't take your side.

482
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,853
Who asked you to?

483
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,664
You'll regret. Really.

484
00:57:20,574 --> 00:57:23,634
Don't put on such
a despondent face so early.

485
00:57:29,254 --> 00:57:32,543
This time we're both in an urgent situation.

486
00:57:35,825 --> 00:57:40,028
I don't mind if I get expelled
or have to quit school.

487
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:42,370
But that can't happen for you.

488
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,871
Even if he's Gu Jun Pyo,
he can't do that right?

489
00:57:47,121 --> 00:57:48,603
He can.

490
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:52,090
Jun Pyo has the Shinhwa Group backing him.

491
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:56,526
And did you forget who owns this school?

492
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,654
Don't put on such an expression.

493
00:58:02,404 --> 00:58:04,890
I won't stand back and do nothing.

494
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:07,424
Do you have a plan?

495
00:58:08,638 --> 00:58:10,432
I'll have to find one,

496
00:58:10,683 --> 00:58:15,120
because now I have a reason not
to sit back and concede quietly.

497
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,526
That's right.

498
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:22,779
Kicking you out of F4 is not
something that can be tolerated.

499
00:58:24,829 --> 00:58:26,641
You're really silly.

500
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:29,153
What?

501
00:58:29,356 --> 00:58:31,430
I don't care about that.

502
00:58:39,602 --> 00:58:41,405
That expression again.

503
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:00,466
I'm back.

504
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:03,288
Hurry come in.

505
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:07,618
What's all this about?

506
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,846
Where have you been?
Coming back at this time only.

507
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,715
We're shorthanded!

508
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:13,356
Hurry change your clothes
and come back down.

509
00:59:13,409 --> 00:59:14,476
What's up all of a sudden?

510
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:15,878
As the saying goes,

511
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:17,211
good things begets more good things.

512
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:19,775
This is all thanks to
our daughter's good fortune.

513
00:59:19,987 --> 00:59:23,298
Sending your uniform to our laundry
can let you meet a rich guy.

514
00:59:23,299 --> 00:59:24,428
This news has spread to other people.

515
00:59:24,646 --> 00:59:25,441
What?

516
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:26,489
Look at this.

517
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,913
Hankook Girls High, Han Gang Girls High,
Moon Hwa Girls High.

518
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,898
They even send from across the Han River.

519
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:34,270
Wow, we've hit the jackpot!

520
00:59:34,496 --> 00:59:35,618
I've only heard of such things in the past.

521
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,692
This is the first time
I'm experiencing such a thing.

522
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,848
Noona, you're not dating Gu Jun Pyo.

523
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:42,769
But you're dating Yoon Ji Hoo,
another F4 member, right?

524
00:59:44,033 --> 00:59:45,847
Where did you hear that from?

525
00:59:48,849 --> 00:59:51,437
The Shinhwa uniform was the first to arrive.

526
00:59:52,004 --> 00:59:54,429
It doesn't matter whether it is
Gu Jun Pyo or Yoon Ji Hoo.

527
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,113
I don't care.

528
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,209
Ever since you entered Shinhwa High School,

529
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:01,098
everyday has been like a dream for me.

530
01:00:01,505 --> 01:00:04,424
Honey, this is not a dream that
I'd wake up from tomorrow right?

531
01:00:04,425 --> 01:00:05,989
Wait a moment.

532
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,511
Sorry.

533
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:10,385
Didn't I say this before?

534
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:11,448
Everything would work out fine.

535
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:13,226
The Shinhwa Group is not the only chaebol.

536
01:00:13,469 --> 01:00:15,336
The legend of laundry business!

537
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,947
We will become chaebols too!

538
01:00:18,312 --> 01:00:23,606
Chaebol! Chaebol!
Chaebol! Chaebol!

539
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:50,429
Speak.

540
01:00:51,442 --> 01:00:54,189
No matter what you did before,
I could understand.

541
01:00:54,396 --> 01:00:58,755
Honestly, there were times when
I couldn't stand Jun Pyo too.

542
01:00:59,262 --> 01:01:01,816
I never expected to be saying
these things to you now.

543
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,895
This is not like you.

544
01:01:04,129 --> 01:01:05,104
Why did you do it?

545
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:07,790
I just felt like it.

546
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,235
Jun Pyo liked Jan Di...

547
01:01:09,442 --> 01:01:10,209
And I knew it.

548
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:11,709
Yoon Ji Hoo!

549
01:01:12,552 --> 01:01:16,025
Even if you hooked up with my sister
and dumped her after three days,

550
01:01:16,026 --> 01:01:17,723
I wouldn't be this mad.

551
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:19,910
You don't have a sister.

552
01:01:20,118 --> 01:01:21,834
I'm not joking.

553
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:26,243
I can't tolerate you messing
with a friend's girl.

554
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:27,707
I feel sorry towards Jun Pyo.

555
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:29,419
- But...
- But what?

556
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,364
I can't let Geum Jan Di
be kicked out of school.

557
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,606
So, what do you intend to do?

558
01:01:37,075 --> 01:01:39,053
I have to do something.

559
01:01:39,552 --> 01:01:41,418
There's no turning back.

560
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,400
You're not going to have
anyone on your side this time.

561
01:01:45,491 --> 01:01:47,419
Don't be disappointed.

562
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:07,881
I understand how you feel.

563
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,347
But Jun Pyo,

564
01:02:09,348 --> 01:02:11,816
expelling them from school is too much.

565
01:02:12,657 --> 01:02:13,827
Too much?

566
01:02:13,828 --> 01:02:17,471
That should only be used when I kill them.

567
01:02:23,014 --> 01:02:25,281
Ji Hoo is not in his right mind.

568
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:27,870
You know very well how much
Seo Hyun meant to him.

569
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,995
Given his character,
he even chased her to Paris.

570
01:02:30,996 --> 01:02:34,400
Suddenly hearing that she's getting married
is enough to drive him crazy.

571
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:36,241
Exactly.

572
01:02:36,993 --> 01:02:39,887
That guy doesn't even like
Geum Jan Di sincerely.

573
01:02:40,366 --> 01:02:43,952
It's because of Seo Hyun
that he's using Geum Jan Di.

574
01:02:45,325 --> 01:02:48,418
I can't forgive him for that.
You know?

575
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:55,305
Jun Pyo.

576
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,055
Don't side with that fella anymore.

577
01:03:01,357 --> 01:03:04,452
If you say one more word, you're out too.

<i>Let Jan Di go.</i>

586
01:03:31,735 --> 01:03:33,511
What if I don't let her go?

587
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:34,700
I'll protect her.

588
01:03:34,701 --> 01:03:38,344
I remember the friend whom I've
watched this movie with for 11 times.

589
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:41,204
I never thought this would happen.

590
01:03:44,656 --> 01:03:46,902
Hey you stupid fools!
How can I go into the water?

591
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,559
It doesn't matter to you
whether he wins or loses.

592
01:03:49,781 --> 01:03:50,469
But Jan Di...

593
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,860
...would probably be expelled.

594
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:53,435
What's wrong with those kids?

595
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:57,447
Shouldn't you be glad that
Jun Pyo has such friend by his side?

596
01:03:57,448 --> 01:04:02,026
The heir to Shinhwa Group
doesn't need any friends.

597
01:04:03,275 --> 01:04:05,559
<i>It's not too late now.</i>

598
01:04:06,484 --> 01:04:08,029
I just need one word from you.

599
01:04:08,248 --> 01:04:13,124
Just tell me that you like me.

600
01:04:13,493 --> 01:04:18,403
I won't regret.
I definitely won't regret.
