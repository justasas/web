Episode 3

4
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:54,041
A man, who leaves a beautiful girl
standing by herself, isn't a gentleman.

5
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,665
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

6
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,355
<i>I feel like I'm standing on a cloud.</i>

7
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:07,772
<i>It would be nice if you could take your feet off my shoes.</i>

8
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,075
She looks like another person.

9
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:27,804
Definitely Min Seo Hyun's work.

10
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:30,525
Maybe I should take her to
the next exhibition as my partner?

11
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,591
What is that?

12
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:05,892
Oh, annoying!

13
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,777
Help me!

14
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,034
He fell in!

15
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,575
<i>Jun Pyo...</i>

16
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:33,175
Gu Jun Pyo sunbae fell into the pool!

17
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:34,906
<i>Hurry, hurry!</i>

18
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,384
What is it?

19
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,005
Why are you so nervous?

20
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:48,464
He can't.

21
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:49,095
What?

22
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:53,095
The one thing Jun Pyo can't do is swim.

23
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:05,514
<i>Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

24
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:06,805
<i>Gu Jun Pyo, wake up!</i>

25
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:09,635
Open your eyes!

26
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,455
Hurry up and breathe, Gu Jun Pyo!

27
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,295
<i>Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

28
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,025
Wake up!

29
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,185
What?

30
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:02,527
You are such a scum.

31
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:49,415
You deceitful bastard!

32
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:58,885
I'm sorry, Young Master.

33
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:00,394
<i>I'll prepare a new one.</i>

34
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:01,605
Please forgive me.

35
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,050
What?

36
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:08,054
Do you have a cold?

37
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:10,145
Should I call Dr. Kim?

38
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,434
What cold?

39
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:14,674
I feel great.

40
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:17,645
Prepare the car. I need to quickly get to school.

41
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:20,605
You want to leave this early?

42
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:22,975
It's never too early for a student to go to school.

43
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,984
Don't you know the saying,

44
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:28,913
<i>{\a6}note: The saying is
"The early bird catches the worm."</i>

45
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:28,913
"Bugs who wake up early die early?"

46
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:33,524
I will fire this maid immediately.

47
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:34,395
Why?

48
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,754
Yes?

49
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:47,254
Butler Lee, aren't you too picky?

50
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,534
Take it easy, take it easy.

51
00:07:53,935 --> 00:07:57,109
The weather is so nice.

52
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:38,384
What is this?

53
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,996
Gu Jun Pyo!

54
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:49,994
Don't let me catch you!

55
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,292
I definitely won't go easy on you!

56
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:57,057
He asked us here so early and
he's been like this the whole day.

57
00:08:57,645 --> 00:09:00,635
This is the first time I've seen
him work so hard at something.

58
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:06,044
But the question is, why
torture a poor transfer student?

59
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,584
Also, didn't she save his life?

60
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:13,054
"Don't bite the hand that feeds you."
You should apply that in this situation, right?

61
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,854
What are you saying,
"don't bite the hand that feeds you?"

62
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,834
This is my way of telling her thanks.

63
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:21,634
Why else would I do such boring
things for someone so lowly?

64
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:25,934
Normal people won't feel grateful for something like this.

65
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,344
Be quiet!

66
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:29,634
It's your turn to scold me since Ji Hoo isn't here?

67
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,824
Really!

68
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:31,974
Where is he?

69
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:33,414
Ever since we came back from Guam.

70
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,414
I don't what happened.
He's completely slipped into a depression.

71
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:37,884
It must be a lovers' quarrel.
What else could it be?

72
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,224
Min Seo Hyun is so hard to please.

73
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:42,155
He's beating around the bush.

74
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:45,204
If you like a girl, you should
just grab her and kiss her.

75
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:46,625
How hard can it be?

76
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,915
I'll leave after I do this.

77
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:35,015
Jun Pyo sunbae isn't enough for her,
she wants Ji Hoo sunbae as well!

78
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:38,099
You are really digging your own grave.

79
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,134
<i>Hurry and go!</i>

80
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,334
<i>She looks sly as a fox!</i>

81
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:43,755
She is the type of girl who won't back off.

82
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:46,945
Stupid girl, what should we do now?

83
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:13,295
What time is it? Why are you here so late?

84
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:18,425
As a swimmer, how can you not focus on your practice!

85
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:21,671
Be careful or I'll fire you.

86
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:56,944
I think they've been together for a while now.

87
00:13:56,945 --> 00:14:01,674
Yes, why else would Ji Hoo sunbae protect that weed?

88
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,194
So as time passes,

89
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:05,504
what if your friendship is destroyed because of that girl?

90
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:06,934
You know now, right?

91
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:11,626
That weed looks innocent,
but her actions are those of a snake.

92
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:13,655
Shut up!

93
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:18,746
If you say one word, I will snap your neck.

94
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,401
This is the newest model.

95
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:33,895
Are you disappointed that it wasn't
the person you wanted see?

96
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:36,845
- Gu Jun Pyo, why are you?
- What?

97
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,718
I can't come here?

98
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:44,546
Have you two rented this place?

99
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:51,524
- Where are you going?
- I have nothing to say to you, I'm going home, why?

100
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,705
I have...

101
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:55,024
- What do you want?
- I have something to say.

102
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,715
Say it and let me go.

103
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:59,455
Who are you?
You think you can toy with me?

104
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,345
Toy with the great F4.

105
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:04,435
Who's toying with who?

106
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:06,708
Let me go!

107
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:10,746
I'm letting you go because
I think you are cute.

108
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,286
Am I a joke?

109
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,945
I don't know if you know...

110
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:20,210
I'm not the kind of person who
repays what is given to me.

111
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:27,832
I'm dissatisfied repaying an equal amount.

112
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:32,181
What are you doing?

113
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:38,164
I don't want to!

114
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,455
I don't want to!

115
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:41,698
I don't want to!

116
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:00,509
Am I that loathsome?

117
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,965
<i>Geum Jan Di, are you not going to school?</i>

118
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:40,694
I'm not going.

119
00:17:40,695 --> 00:17:42,124
Do you want to get hit and then go to school
or go to school now?

120
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,715
I'm not going. Hit me.

121
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,385
<i>You, really!</i>

122
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,494
I'm not going!

123
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:48,334
I can't go!

124
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,354
I rather break the ice of Han river than go there.

125
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:52,954
I am not going to that school.

126
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,674
If want to see me die then force me to go.

127
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,404
- You,
- Isn't today a no school Saturday?*

128
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:58,391
<i>{\a6}*(In Korea, there's no school on 2nd & 4th Saturday every month)</i>

129
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,684
<i>Also,</i>

130
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:04,444
An ahjussi told me to give this to you.

131
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,705
<i>What's this?</i>

132
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:07,985
What?

133
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:10,959
<i>{\a6}[Invitation: Hello, I want to invite all of you to my
home for my 23rd birthday. Please attend. "Min Seo Hyun"]</i>

134
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:12,565
Party?

135
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:14,735
<i>Party?</i>

136
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:18,708
Then that means our Jan Di is
finally making her way into society!

137
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:20,894
<i>Oh, Honey!</i>

138
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:23,944
<i>Honey! Honey!</i>

139
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:25,314
Let me see.

140
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:26,604
Hurry, give it to me.

141
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,134
We shouldn't be like this right now.

142
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:29,134
Dress.

143
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:31,214
Honey, dress, dress.

144
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:33,339
Dress.

145
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:06,384
I'm sorry Jan Di, your father is useless.

146
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:09,965
I can't even provide my daughter with a proper dress.

147
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:11,614
This poor neighborhood

148
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:15,605
can't even bring in one decent outfit.

149
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:19,154
Can't she wear this hanbok?

150
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,924
Is she going to visit her in-laws for New Years?

151
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:24,787
They are having a party, party.

152
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:27,124
Usually, at a time like this,

153
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,575
in dramas the prince would always buy an outfit.

154
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,308
Hello.

155
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:38,079
This is Ms. Min Seo Hyun's gift to Geum Jan Di.

156
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:39,515
This!

157
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:49,553
This is pretty.

158
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,604
<i>- She should be wearing it like this right?
- Yes ,yes.</i>

159
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:52,935
<i>Pull it down a bit.</i>

160
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:13,854
Why didn't you call me for your last exhibition?

161
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:16,174
You said you would contact us, but you never did.

162
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:19,004
It's the same with me.

163
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:21,324
Who did you come with today?

164
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:23,474
<i>It seems like you don't have a partner.
Why don't I be yours?</i>

165
00:20:23,475 --> 00:20:25,704
Why are you like that?
I already set my sights on him.

166
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:26,494
<i>Don't touch him!</i>

167
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,894
<i>- What are you doing?
- You are really funny.</i>

168
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,935
Excuse me for a while, sorry.

169
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:34,004
Honey, why are you so late?

170
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:36,295
Why did you get here so late?

171
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,475
Why are you here?

172
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,095
It's because Seo Hyun unni invited me here.

173
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,935
Did you empty a department store?

174
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:54,705
She came late last time too.

175
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,334
Geum Jan Di,

176
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:58,675
she's pretty when she's dressed up.

177
00:20:58,795 --> 00:20:59,694
<i>Right, right.</i>

178
00:20:59,695 --> 00:21:02,264
You look the cutest here today.

179
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,095
Who's cute?

180
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:07,104
Can a pumpkin turn into a
watermelon by drawing lines on it?

181
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:11,104
Gu Jun Pyo,

182
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,420
actually said the right idiom.

183
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,904
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

184
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:11,604
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

185
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:16,064
<i>Happy birthday dear, Min Seo Hyun.</i>

186
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:20,552
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

187
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:42,467
<i>Thank you everyone for attending
my 23rd birthday celebration.</i>

188
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:46,165
I would like to thank my dad and mom for their care.

189
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:49,606
And the love of my friends.

190
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:54,645
<i>I want to use this gathering to tell you something.</i>

191
00:22:55,135 --> 00:23:00,784
That's why I'm having party,
which isn't like me.

192
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:03,315
Where did that punk Ji Hoo go?

193
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:05,698
Are they announcing their engagement?

194
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:09,625
I will be returning to Paris next week,

195
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:13,591
and I don't think I'm coming back.

196
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:19,135
My modeling firm and I have arranged everything.

197
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:21,505
What is she saying?

198
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:29,264
Thanks to my parents, I can enjoy life
without having to work hard.

199
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:34,388
But I want to use my own abilities,
so I'm choosing a new road.

200
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,685
I won't be inheriting my parents' law firm.

201
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,785
What I want is,

202
00:23:43,585 --> 00:23:48,263
a life where I'm able to experience a broader world.

203
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:54,115
If I didn't do this,

204
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:57,214
I don't think I would've been able to
convince the people around me.

205
00:23:57,215 --> 00:23:59,075
So I set this stage...

206
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:04,211
Everyone,

207
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,925
you must be happy.

208
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:26,705
Min Seo Hyun, really is a bomb full of surprises.

209
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,984
Ji Hoo,

210
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:30,315
did he already know about this?

211
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:35,245
Now we know why he's been depressed all this time.

212
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:36,744
So cool.

213
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:38,954
Really is cool, but...

214
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:41,096
what about Ji Hoo?

215
00:24:57,795 --> 00:24:59,317
Hello.

216
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:05,398
You still have it.

217
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:10,911
That was the first summer
we spent apart from each other.

218
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,363
You still remember.

219
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:20,661
It's from that time onwards,

220
00:25:21,615 --> 00:25:24,165
that you stopped calling me "Noona."

221
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:27,016
What am I to you?

222
00:25:32,585 --> 00:25:36,305
Our Ji Hoo is really angry.

223
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:43,664
I feel like I'm being thrown away.

224
00:25:43,665 --> 00:25:47,005
If there's anything here
that can't be thrown away...

225
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,255
it's you.

226
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:52,924
Don't lie to me!

227
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:54,785
If I was lying,

228
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:58,835
I wouldn't mind you looking at other women.

229
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:01,984
What do you mean?

230
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:04,843
When you ran towards that girl,

231
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:08,292
I didn't understand why my heart suddenly sank.

232
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,179
It's funny, right?

233
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:14,271
I'm not in the mood to listen to you joke around.

234
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,539
I felt pleased, however.

235
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:24,184
I didn't know when our Ji Hoo became a man.

236
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:26,220
Don't joke!

237
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:33,465
You always do what you want.

238
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:35,304
I can't stay close, nor can I stay away.

239
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:37,555
You'll wind me up one day,
then ignore me another day.

240
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:39,715
I'm only a toy.

241
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:45,572
If I lost you, I wouldn't be able to sleep.

242
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:49,514
Then tell me who is looking at whom?

243
00:26:49,515 --> 00:26:53,025
For the past 15 years, I've only looked at you.
Isn't that enough?

244
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,755
I'm also a man.

245
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,455
I want to hold you,

246
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,959
like a man.

247
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:11,176
I know.

248
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:14,685
I'm sorry, Ji Hoo.

249
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:18,938
I'm really sorry.

250
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:16,075
<i>If you faint here, it will really be embarrassing.</i>

251
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,945
It's not like you to faint.

252
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:21,984
You know that, right?

253
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:25,550
Who's going to faint?

254
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:35,364
Jan Di, you came.

255
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:38,224
Since you came, why didn't you come in?

256
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:42,715
That... so...

257
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:49,695
I wanted to say thank you.
I was about to go in.

258
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,664
The party is boring, right?

259
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:55,864
We are going for a drive.

260
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:56,975
Do you want to come with us?

261
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:58,245
Eh?

262
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,344
No, it's okay.

263
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:05,285
We have another place to go.

264
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:06,959
We?

265
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,020
Yes.

266
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,296
This punk and I,

267
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,700
we're also going for a drive.

268
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,510
Drive! We are going for a drive!

269
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,040
Seo Hyun unni, goodbye.

270
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,011
I will see you later.

271
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,929
Let's go!

272
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,589
Unni!

273
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,859
I have paid my debt.

274
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,849
What?

275
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,979
You saved me from the pool.

276
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,009
I'm your savior!

277
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,590
How can you repay me this way?

278
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,319
Do you want to go back?

279
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,640
10%.

280
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,060
You have repaid that much.

281
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,630
50%.

282
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,081
25%.

283
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,696
Oh, this is great.

284
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,067
But why isn't there a single customer?

285
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,705
They were chased away.

286
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,679
Why?

287
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,575
I booked this place till morning.
Just do what you want.

288
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,590
What do I want to do?

289
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,940
To cry or to scream out.

290
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,237
We can call in the security guards outside
if you want to beat up someone.

291
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,882
But why would I want to do that?

292
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,451
After you saw Ji Hoo and Seo Hyun,
didn't you feel that your heart was breaking?

293
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,210
Oh, that's impossible.

294
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,060
No, a person like me could never
be Min Seo Hyun unni's rival.

295
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,858
I'm not pretty.

296
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,180
My brain is bad as well.

297
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,950
My family is really poor too.

298
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,022
There's nothing great about your figure either.
Your temper is really bad.

299
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,560
Right.

300
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,038
So how could such a messed up person
be jealous of Min Seo Hyun?!

301
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,820
I didn't have the qualifications from the start.

302
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,420
Although there's no comparison,

303
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,926
you're not the messed up one.

304
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,249
You have the qualifications.

305
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,064
What?

306
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,089
Ji Hoo, that fool.

307
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,845
If he had met you first instead of Seo Hyun,

308
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,163
he would have liked you for sure.

309
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,583
Are you sincere?

310
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,839
Family... your looks too.

311
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,976
Your brains... though all of these are zero,

312
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,043
you are the first woman
recognized by Gu Jun Pyo.

313
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,360
Your qualifications get full marks.

314
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,182
I have to go to the washroom.

315
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,450
It's really hot.

316
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,577
I'm really warm and thirsty.

317
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,325
Water...

318
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,243
I really did everything.

319
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,048
Hey, Dry Cleaner.

320
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,058
Hey, wake up!

321
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,789
And so, why is she like this?

322
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,095
Well, look here.

323
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,688
- She drank it all?
- Yes...

324
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,740
Hey!

325
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,895
Hey, get a hold on yourself woman!

326
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,403
Woman...

327
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,449
Right...

328
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,046
I'm a woman.

329
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,179
An ordinary commoner is not a woman?!

330
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:03,700
With no background, looks nor brains.

331
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,810
I know it all too.

332
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:10,119
<i>There was no need for you to be so frank.</i>

333
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,386
I feel it every day within my bones, you jerk.

334
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,660
Jerk?

335
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,189
No...

336
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,899
No...

337
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,893
I...

338
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,845
I have no time to be thinking these things.

339
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:34,973
Actually, I'm a busy person who has lots of work to do.

340
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,079
I don't have the appropriate birth right,
but I have to attend such an aristocratic school.

341
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,140
Being bullied by others.

342
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,999
I have to work part-time jobs because
my dad often gets into trouble.

343
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,309
The school fees.

344
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:55,620
And I have to make time to swim for my scholarship.

345
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,930
I..

346
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:03,800
I haven't the time to accompany rich boys
like you to play the game of love.

347
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,375
You alcoholic.

348
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,720
Hey, gangster!

349
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,710
Wake up!

350
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,268
<i>Ah!</i>

351
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,269
I...

352
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,262
am a little sad today.

353
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,519
I'm a little upset.

354
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,999
Gu Jun Pyo, you punk.

355
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,470
Why are you smiling?

356
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,569
I feel good.

357
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,269
I'll let you off this once.

358
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,796
50.

359
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,879
I'll give you a discount since you saved my life.

360
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,849
Thank you, Gu Jun Pyo.

361
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,378
You saved me today.

362
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:09,894
I can't do anything for you, so instead...

363
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,013
I know that this place must be
really expensive just by its smell.

364
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,373
<i>You are a complete wipeout.</i>

365
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,789
How did I become like this?

366
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,090
Why am I here?

367
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,060
I brought you here.

368
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:35,619
I'm asking you, why am I at
my place instead of yours!?

369
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,766
Don't you remember?

370
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,689
It's a world famous brand.

371
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,339
It's a Gucci designed by the Milan designers.

372
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,470
It was first shown in their
new Spring/Summer collections.

373
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,974
<i>It just arrived the day before, by air from Milan.</i>

374
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:04,410
<i>- The price is...
- Enough...</i>

375
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,346
You want to scare her?

376
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,599
I don't feel like hearing you gloat
about your clothes right now.

377
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,729
That was the suit that I wore yesterday.

378
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,299
Why does the suit you wore
yesterday concern me at all?!

379
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,940
I wore it for the first time yesterday.

380
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,990
But it became the last time
I'll be wearing it, because of who?

381
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,511
Did you remember a little right now?

382
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,189
You came to my place of course,
since you were in that condition.

383
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,274
If not, did you want to go back home?

384
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,979
Sorry...

385
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,330
I already made a call to inform your parents.

386
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,299
It seems that they aren't worried about you.

387
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,079
Then, I'll be leaving now.

388
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,430
Sorry for creating so much trouble.

389
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,396
It's best that you go back to being yourself.

390
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:26,870
Sir...

391
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,029
- What's up?
- Madam, she...

392
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,682
What about that witch?

393
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,977
She has already arrived.

394
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,841
So early?

395
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,823
Why is she here so early?

396
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,610
Where is Jun Pyo?

397
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,009
On the second floor.

398
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,649
I have to make him help out with the event.

399
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,730
Arrange someone to follow him,
so that he doesn't slip away.

400
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,444
<i>I got it.</i>

401
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,611
<i>What are you doing?</i>

402
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,889
Hey, emergency!

403
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,639
What?

404
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,290
The witch came back suddenly.

405
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,879
Jan Di is in my room right now.

406
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,829
I have no way of getting her out.

407
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,219
What?

408
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,779
Jun Pyo, once she finds out...

409
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,874
You are finished.

410
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,359
There is a strange girl in my son's room.

411
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,999
And it's just a "Geum Jan Di."

412
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,989
<i>How is she going to react?</i>

413
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,299
It's really making me curious.

414
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,970
<i>Tomorrow morning...</i>

415
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,469
Jun Pyo...

416
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,720
is going to be sent to Alaska.

417
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,110
$1000

418
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,740
Me?

419
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,539
Dispatched to Se Jong base, $3000

420
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,679
But first, she'll employ a hit-man.

421
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,959
What?

422
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,633
Really?

423
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,162
She is that scary?

424
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,069
When we went to summer camp in sixth grade,
we escaped that day.

425
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,079
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

426
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,959
<i>We really almost died that day.</i>

427
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,490
<i>So how could we forget about it?</i>

428
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,173
<i>Don't move!</i>

429
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,700
<i>Bonjour. Noona.</i>

430
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,439
<i>You are Yi Jung, right?</i>

431
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,789
How can you be so good-looking?

432
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,819
Noona, you are Korea's Vivian.

433
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,249
Everyone has been saying it.

434
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,933
What do you want? Say it quickly.

435
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,447
What do you want from me?

436
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,849
You knew it...

437
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,125
That's why I like you so much.

438
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:55,475
<i>The Seoul branch has sent over the concept
application of helping kids with kidney stones.</i>

439
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,409
Reject.

440
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,049
The education resources, and Shinhwa school too.

441
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:03,267
Reject.

442
00:43:05,795 --> 00:43:07,839
You didn't let Jun Pyo escape, right?

443
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
<i>Yes.</i>

444
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,776
Who is she?

445
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,115
Hello.

446
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,919
She's my guest, so it's none of your business.

447
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,689
She's my guest as well
since she's come to my home.

448
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,377
<i>Isn't that so, Miss?</i>

449
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,695
She is our friend.

450
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,238
Friend?

451
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,999
Yes, she's our school junior.

452
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,079
We let her join F4 specially as our mascot,
because she looks so cute.

453
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,817
Well, it's like that.

454
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,696
Which family's daughter are you?

455
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,243
- I'm...
- What work does your father do?

456
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,911
- My father is...
- He's a businessman.

457
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,019
Yes, is that so?

458
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,749
What kind?

459
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,809
Well, clothes.

460
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,109
No, no... The fashion business.

461
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:54,278
He's quite famous in the clothing world.

462
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,009
That's quite interesting.

463
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:01,099
And so, are you interested in today's auction?

464
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,519
Yes, not only is she interested.

465
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,898
She brought with her Bella Song's new work
which will be the dark horse for the auction tonight.

466
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,659
It looks like your mother has very good taste.

467
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,986
What work does she do?

468
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,096
Chairman, it's time to welcome the guests.

469
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,860
Jun Pyo, you stay behind to guard your position.

470
00:45:28,283 --> 00:45:29,539
<i>You guys too...</i>

471
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,560
It's for a good cause, help out as well.

472
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,291
Yes...

473
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,829
How can you lie?

474
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,933
How are we going to do damage control?

475
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,324
We should have told her the truth.

476
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,537
Then be honest by saying that your dad runs a dry cleaner
and your mom operates a public bath?

477
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:06,489
But then, not only you, but your family as well,
will encounter things no one can guarantee.

478
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,559
You will lose your life once she singles you out.

479
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,161
This is not a joke.

480
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,408
That...

481
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,425
is it hereditary?

482
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,069
<i>The auction item this time,</i>

483
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,679

00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,919
<i>The item is now here!</i>

485
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,359
Everyone's attention on it please.

486
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,560
The auction item this time is...

487
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:40,800
Marine Boy Swimmer, Park Tae Hwan's goggles.

488
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,702
Swimmer Park Tae Hwan's goggles?

489
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,836
<i>Now, the starting price is from 500,000 Won.</i>

490
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:03,960
1 million.

491
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,710
<i>1 million Won is called out.</i>

492
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:06,896
2 million.

493
00:47:06,898 --> 00:47:09,630
2 million Won is called out.

494
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:10,898
7 million.

495
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,779
7 million Won is called out.

496
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,269
Now is anyone willing to pay 7.5 million Won?

497
00:47:15,993 --> 00:47:16,989
8 million.

498
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,299
8 million Won is called out.

499
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,353
Is there anyone for 8.5 million Won?

500
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,015
Yes, 8.5 million Won.

501
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,039
10 million Won over here.

502
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,589
<i>Yes, 10 million Won!</i>

503
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:37,760
<i>Just now, someone telephoned
with a bid of 10 million Won!</i>

504
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:40,119
Is there anyone who wants to bid a higher price?

505
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,549
<i>If there isn't, then...</i>

506
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,889
Then the auction is going to close.

507
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,179
One!

508
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,249
<i>Two!</i>

509
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,140
Three!

510
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,470
<i>The deal is sealed for 10 million won.</i>

511
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,469
<i>The auction item this time...</i>

512
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,149
Everyone's attention please be on it.

513
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,509

518
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,189
<i>The auction item this time, is the Pavioni suit
worn by Gu Jun Pyo of the Shinhwa group.</i>

519
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:48,219
<i>The suit's most highlighted aspect is it's so light,
you feel as though you're not wearing it.</i>

520
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,470
<i>The starting price for it is from 10 million won.</i>

521
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,049

<i>What are you doing? Let's go quickly.</i>

527
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,090
Your turn is next.

<i>If you wear it for 10 years, it'll still
be elegant as though you just bought it.</i>

529
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:45,715
<i>25 million won! Anyone for 30 million?
Yes, there's 30 million won!</i>

530
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:48,679
The auction item this time
is really brightening eyes.

531
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,707
<i>- Bella Song's new collection.
- I can't do it. I can't, just this once.</i>

532
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,419
<i>Everyone, please pay attention.</i>

533
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:30,409
<i>The pale elegant lemon yellow
will highlight your attractiveness.</i>

534
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:35,519
The shining gold accessories on the
dress will increase your elegance.

535
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,645
Bella Song new design's starting
price will be 10 million Won.

536
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,380
<i>Yes, 10 million Won, going once!</i>

537
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:48,449
<i>How about 15 million Won?
Yes! 15 million is called.</i>

538
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,144
What has Jun Pyo been doing lately?

539
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:53,989
He's more well-behaved these days.

540
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,084
<i>And he is taking school more seriously.</i>

541
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,170
Then, do you know that female student?

542
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,509
<i>Bella Song's eye catching new dress,</i>

543
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,387
<i>will transform you perfectly. Now...</i>

544
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,106
I finally meet the famous wonder girl.

545
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,881
I'm happy to meet you.

546
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,735
I wasn't the one who pushed him, really.

547
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,759
<i>Assistant Kim.</i>

548
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,009
Yes...

549
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:23,690
According to what I know, she is a
transfer student at Shinhwa High School.

550
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,804
Check out which family's daughter she is.

551
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,339
I got it.

552
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:36,170
<i>The feel of the fabric of Bella Song's new design
will make you look more glamorous.</i>

553
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:41,900
<i>This is the dress that's really
popular this season in Paris.</i>

554
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:45,869
<i>Oh, my.</i>

555
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,179
Is this for real?

556
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,969
Are these the goggles that
Park Tae Hwan used before?

557
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,329
Hey, this is not a joke at all.

558
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:56,980
Noona, Noona, you are going to be rich for sure.

559
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,049
Superbly rich this time.

560
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,549
What again?

561
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:06,354
Park Tae Hwan's goggles will fetch you
2 million Won if you were to sell them.

562
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,359
2 million Won?

563
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,259
<i>A pair of goggles are worth 2 million Won?</i>

564
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,009
Sell them, sell them right now.

565
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:14,312
Where else can you get 2 million Won?

566
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,841
No, these are really expensive!

567
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:23,139
Well, what I meant is...

568
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,809
Their worth can't be measured with money.

569
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,349
I meant that.

570
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,019
Sell them! 2 million, 2 million!

571
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,749
We are selling them even if it's 20,000!

572
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,189
I really don't know what you are thinking about.

573
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,675
Oh, really...

574
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,592
But still, selling them is a little...

575
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,410
I don't care anymore.

576
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,033
Good night.

577
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,319
Jan Di!

578
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,419
Hey, girl!

579
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,943
Wait, look at her. Don't block me, hey!

580
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:33,057
I'm leaving.

581
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,730
Anyway, thank you.

582
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,949
What?

583
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:38,499
I can't hear it.

584
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,379
Thank you.

585
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,379
What?

586
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,272
I said, thank you!!

587
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,379
Just a simple "thank you" would've been enough.
Why did you have to add on "anyway"?

588
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,859
That's right, you are rather prideful
since you are a commoner.

589
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,199
You were pretending when you'd heard me already.

590
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:54,899
Cancelled.

591
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,029
What?

592
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,450
I'm canceling my thank you.

593
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,399
That's right, people won't change that easily.

594
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,139
I'm leaving.

595
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,379
Hey, Jandi baht*...
(*grass field)

596
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,705
What?!

597
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,394
Don't you ever drink when I'm not around.

598
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,308
Seo Hyun unni, why are you here?

599
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:27,306
I came here because I had
to process my school withdrawal.

600
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,609
I wanted to see you one more time before I leave,
so I came here to try my luck.

601
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,130
I was lucky.

602
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,031
Leaving school?

603
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,487
You really aren't returning?

604
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,448
I'm afraid so.

605
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,582
When will you be leaving?

606
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,394
Tomorrow.

607
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,938
Why so soon?

608
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:59,035
There's no time to say thanks to you.

609
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,296
I still haven't returned the favors I owe you.

610
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:08,035
I'll be really disappointed if
you keep saying things like that.

611
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:15,411
I knew from the first time we met,

612
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:21,229
you are the person that our Ji Hoo
always smiles when mentioning.

613
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,940
It's you, Jan Di.

614
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,834
Well, Unni.

615
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,010
<i>Jan Di...</i>

616
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,794
What are you doing?

617
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:31,517
I was a fan of yours for a very
long time, even before I met you.

618
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:39,774
And so, I understand why you made
such a decision more than many others. But still...

619
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:47,443
I'm begging you not to leave.

620
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,812
Get up quickly.

621
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,129
I know really well that I'm not qualified to beg
you and there's no reason for you to listen.

622
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,762
But I don't know what to do besides this.

623
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,146
Is it because of Ji Hoo?

624
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:15,548
I don't know anything at all about Ji Hoo sunbae.

625
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,614
<i>But...</i>

626
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,680
<i>I know,</i>

627
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,730
<i>how precious you are to him.</i>

628
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:39,736
When I see him, why does he
always have an unknown sadness?

629
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:43,044
<i>But he will still smile sometimes,</i>

630
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,999
and can melt other people's hearts.

631
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,235
It is really warm.

632
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,271
Unni, you are the only person
that can make him smile.

633
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,659
If you are to leave like this,

634
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,856
there's a possibility he may never smile again.

635
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:17,321
<i>Just get up quickly.</i>

636
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,336
Jan Di...

637
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:39,628
Whatever decisions I've made
are similar to shopping overseas.

638
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:45,618
There won't be another chance
if I don't remain firm at that moment.

639
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,479
I know clearly how cruel those feelings of regrets are.

640
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:00,756
Ji Hoo is a really precious person to me as well.

641
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,726
I believe he feels the same way too.

642
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:12,372
And so, I feel that Ji Hoo wouldn't want
to see me living with regrets as well.

643
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,864
How do you feel about this?

644
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:23,319
Sorry. I'm sorry.

645
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:31,012
No, I'm really happy that you
are telling me these things.

646
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,164
Thanks.

647
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,918
Unni...

648
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,011
Oh, wait.

649
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:49,786
You are going to give me these?

650
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,289
I told you before, right?

651
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,100
Shoes are the most important things.

652
01:02:55,540 --> 01:03:00,378
I hope that these shoes will bring
you to a good place for sure.

653
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:07,443
I have something to request from you as well.

654
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:14,120
Let our Ji Hoo regain his smile again.

655
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,977
What are you doing?

656
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,208
Who are you to do this kind of thing?

657
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:44,962
Did anyone ask for that kind of favor?

658
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:49,435
That isn't even a favor. It's groveling.

659
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,389
Don't you have any pride?

660
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,373
It's not because I don't have pride.

661
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:02,751
It's because you were hurting too much.

662
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,519
Because you were about to die from sadness.

663
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,269
What does it matter to you?

664
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,639
It has nothing to do with you, does it?

665
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,839
Get lost.

<i>Tell me what a real man is like?</i>

674
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:50,130
A man who is responsible from the beginning 'till the end.

675
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,119
<i>Geum Jan Di, you and I...</i>

676
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,919
No, this is impossible!

677
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,622
Mom, Dad, please forgive me.

678
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,220
Isn't he the heir of Shinhwa group?

679
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,199
<i>It's the next flight.</i>

680
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,019
<i>Luckily both of us are on the flight.</i>

681
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,199
<i>When do we have the right to love freely?</i>

682
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,769
The final decision lies in the hands of our parents.

683
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,595
You haven't forgotten it, right?

684
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,259
<i>You only talk about being a real man?</i>

685
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:22,370
Is it true between you and F4's Gu Jun Pyo?

686
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:26,524
To lie to Senior Jun Pyo is
equivalent to lying to all of us.

687
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,954
Geum Jan Di...

688
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:33,206
I don't know you from now onwards.
