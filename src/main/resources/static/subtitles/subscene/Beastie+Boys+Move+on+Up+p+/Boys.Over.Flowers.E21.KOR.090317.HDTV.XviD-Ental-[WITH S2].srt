3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,300
Young Master.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,900
You need to wake up, Young Master.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,060
You need to wake up now.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,460
Young Master.

7
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:22,841
Young Master.

8
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:23,761
Young Master!

9
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,621
I said you need to wake...!

10
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:27,601
Hey, just what are you doing?

11
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:29,101
5 minutes.

12
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:32,260
Let me stay like this for just 5 minutes.
Then I'll wake up.

13
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:42,186
Even though I'm holding you like this,
I can't believe that you're here.

14
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,038
<i>Hey, Jun, I'm here.</i>

15
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:54,498
<i>We...</i>

16
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,171
Jan Di.

17
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:08,931
What's going on here?

18
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,316
That's...

19
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:15,316
I mean, there's...

20
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:19,376
<i>Jae Kyung.</i>

21
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,476
Waking our Jun Pyo isn't easy.

22
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:23,716
Already?

23
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,731
Hold on. You?

24
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:35,291
How are you here...?

25
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:38,331
In that attire...?

26
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:44,991
Speak.

27
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,925
Exactly who was it?

28
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:51,225
Who was the insolent fool
who brought you into this house?

29
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,865
<i>That would be me.</i>

30
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:00,965
Grandma...

31
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:06,076
Grandma, why are you...?

32
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:08,796
It's been a while, My Lady.

33
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:12,087
No, I should address you as "President" now.

34
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:15,127
I guess I'm not used to it yet.

35
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:16,907
What's going on here?

36
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,047
You haven't forgotten, have you?

37
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,227
Under the wishes of the late President,

38
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:25,793
the administration of personnel
in this estate is under my jurisdiction.

39
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:31,393
In addition, that contract can't be
voided by The Lady or anyone else.

40
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:33,898
The fact that you're present,
Grandma, is not an issue.

41
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:35,998
But why is that child here?

42
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:38,978
I cannot allow for an instant
someone like that in my house.

43
00:02:39,098 --> 00:02:41,038
Remove her immediately!

44
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:42,698
I cannot do that.

45
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:43,763
Grandma!

46
00:02:43,883 --> 00:02:46,903
It is within my authority to employ her.

47
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:49,763
The same goes for dismissing her.

48
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:55,318
I do not think that this is a process
that you may take part in, President Kang.

49
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:56,958
Moreover...

50
00:02:57,078 --> 00:03:00,378
While that child may
be inexperienced in many ways,

51
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:04,918
I think that it's another
reason to not dismiss her yet.

52
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,539
This elderly gentlewoman's apprentice
being so unsatisfactory,

53
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:14,519
could this austered household's
dignity still stands?

54
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,519
Grandma!

55
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,325
What are you doing?

56
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:20,365
Jan Di, hurry up and follow me.

57
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:23,085
There are mountains of work to get through.

58
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,665
Yes, Madam.

59
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:00,054
Thank you very much.

60
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:07,567
I didn't do that to receive your gratitude.

61
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,427
Don't misunderstand.

62
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:10,867
Excuse me?

63
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:17,307
I didn't do that because
of Miss Jun Hee's request.

64
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,889
Even after leaving this house,

65
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:26,029
I would always worry about
Young Master Jun Pyo.

66
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:30,609
He always had such a delicate nature.

67
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,729
But I couldn't prevent him from
becoming more violent as he grew up.

68
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:41,885
I heard something similar
from Seo Hyun unni a while back.

69
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:44,925
That Young Master...

70
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:47,265
He has changed.

71
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:51,217
I believe that it was because of you.

72
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:57,157
I have a great debt to this household.

73
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:05,704
And I live believing that assisting Young Master
as best as possible is my life's final mission.

75
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,649
I'm in my 80's.

76
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:12,063
My one pride is my great eye for people.

77
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:15,943
Even now, all I can do
is trust that instinct.

78
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:21,263
Sunbae-nim...

79
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,727
Don't we...

80
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,083
need to have a talk?

81
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,610
You look very pretty.

82
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,270
I didn't realize that a
maid outfit could be this pretty.

83
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,650
Unni...

84
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,610
I...

85
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,746
I know.

86
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:13,886
It must have been hard to tell me.

87
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,926
I know your circumstances.

88
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:19,606
If you think about it, it's not
something that I wouldn't have understood.

89
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:21,741
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,361
But...

91
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:30,601
wasn't I your friend before
I was Jun Pyo's fiancée?

92
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:36,454
It would have been nice if you
talked about it with your friend beforehand.

93
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:38,054
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:42,201
But please don't misunderstand.

95
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,121
I won't misunderstand.

96
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:48,021
But I'll also say one thing.

97
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,435
I won't give up Jun Pyo.

98
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:57,795
No, starting now,
I'm going to really give it my all.

99
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,875
I'm going to do my best
so I don't have any regrets.

100
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:13,377
I just wanted to tell you, Jan Di.

101
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:17,939
I'm going now.

102
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,299
Yes?

103
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,959
Jae Kyung.

104
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,211
Don't have any unnecessary impressions.

105
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,171
You saw earlier so you know.

106
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,211
All this was because that
Grandma just did as she...

107
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:07,696
No.
Please don't worry about it.

108
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,816
That's such a relief.

109
00:08:10,936 --> 00:08:13,896
This is why I like you, Jae Kyung.

110
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:18,220
I will do something about
that child immediately so...

111
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,140
Please don't do that.

112
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,700
I would appreciate it
if you just left Jan Di alone.

113
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,000
Jae Kyung.

114
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,140
Also, I have one more request.

115
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:40,463
We'll end class here today.
Thank you for your hard work.

116
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,703
Thank you for your hard work.

117
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:58,272
What is it?

118
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:01,455
Do you have something
you want to talk to me about?

119
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:04,135
Ah, no.

120
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,395
Teacher.

121
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,168
How did you break up with him?

122
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:32,822
It's me.

123
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,802
I'm heading over now.

124
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,642
I know.

125
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:40,742
If you eat it all and don't leave me any,
I'll really get angry.

126
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:42,624
Okay.

127
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,905
This isn't working.

128
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:05,465
I'm not doing this.

129
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:06,465
Alright, alright.

130
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:09,745
One more time.
I'll teach you properly.

131
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:35,828
Yeah?

132
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,108
Yi Jung?

133
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:39,268
Yeah.

134
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:41,908
Been well?

135
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:43,685
<i>I've been well.</i>

136
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:45,745
<i>Hey, you!
Don't you miss me?</i>

137
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:49,185
<i>Even if you're busy,
you should really put in some face time.</i>

138
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:51,025
Sorry.

139
00:11:53,571 --> 00:11:55,991
Listening to your voice...

140
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:58,451
You sound like something good happened.

141
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,531
<i>Yeah.</i>

142
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,311
Stop by sometime if you're curious.

143
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:04,943
There's someone you need to
meet and I need to tell you something.

144
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:11,503
Someone I need to meet?

145
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:14,043
You'll be really surprised.

146
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:15,874
And really delighted.

147
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:18,114
<i>Feel free to look forward to it,
little brother.</i>

148
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:25,854
- Hyung.
- Hm?

149
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:32,724
You...

150
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:39,705
You're happy, right?

151
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:41,785
Yeah.

152
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:46,785
Sorry that I'm happy by myself.

153
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:54,903
Yi Jung?

154
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:56,983
Yi Jung?

155
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,679
Hey, Monkey...

156
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,199
What is all that?

157
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,109
Everyone, I look forward to being with you.

158
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:03,609
Starting today, I will be learning
"proper wife etiquette" here.

159
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:05,249
I'm Ha Jae Kyung.

160
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:06,429
What?

161
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:44,694
President.

162
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:46,794
Oh?
Is it ready?

163
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:09,001
<i>Jun Pyo-Jae Kyung wedding invitation</i>

164
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,402
What is this?

165
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:17,722
I spoke with Jae Kyung's parents
and we decided to move your wedding up.

166
00:15:17,842 --> 00:15:19,822
You're both already adults.

167
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:23,502
And honestly,
for our companies' business together,

168
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:27,322
it's better for the wedding to
be held as soon as possible.

169
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:30,618
Is it okay to do this
without even asking us?

170
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:32,858
I agreed.

171
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:34,458
What?

172
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,678
Jae Kyung will be living
with us until the wedding.

173
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:42,468
She'll pick up the way our family runs.

174
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:47,488
And Jae Kyung's parents gave special
permission because we were moved

175
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:50,856
by her dedication to prepare in becoming
the next mistress, so that's that.

176
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:53,196
And one more thing.
Chief Jung.

177
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:54,276
Yes.

178
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,336
Young Master and Lady Jae Kyung.

179
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:01,680
The two of you will be featured
in the new Shinhwa's phone commercial.

180
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,780
What?

181
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,500
On who's whim?

182
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,400
The images of you two from that
last launching show were so wonderful

183
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,167
that the web and magazines just couldn't
stop their praises. Didn't you know?

184
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:17,087
The results from our PR
department's analysis shows

185
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:23,174
You two are the best models who will
appeal to our products' high-class image.

186
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:26,694
Jae Kyung.

187
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:29,150
It's some extra work,
but you can assist us, right?

188
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,410
I would be more than happy.

189
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,950
I can't accept this.

190
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,590
Jun Pyo.

191
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,870
Give and take.

192
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:41,917
You know that fundamental
rule of business, correct?

193
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:41,064
<i>Will you come to my room for a bit?</i>

194
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,819
How do I look?

195
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,359
Pretty.

196
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,959
Incredibly pretty.

197
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,864
My mother gave me this.

198
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:28,844
She said it's over 20 years old,
but it's still wearable, right?

199
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:30,724
I'm thinking about just wearing this.

200
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:31,744
Oh!

201
00:18:31,864 --> 00:18:33,464
Come look at this too.

202
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:45,425
She said she won't give me pearls yet.

203
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,665
She's saving those for
when I have my first child.

204
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:49,845
My mother's getting really
ahead of herself, huh?

205
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,285
But isn't it really funny to think about?

206
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:55,425
A child resembling Gu Jun Pyo
and Ha Jae Kyung.

207
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,568
Jan Di.

208
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:03,348
I have a favor to ask.

209
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:04,688
What is it?

210
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,574
Promise me that you'll do it first.

211
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,954
Be my maid of honor.

212
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:18,778
Huh?

213
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,518
It can't be anyone else.

214
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:23,238
I'd like for you to do it.

215
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:25,678
You'll do it, right?

216
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,180
Full shot. Take one.

217
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:03,175
Hey.

218
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:05,755
Paste bait won't work in winter.

219
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,515
Use worms.

220
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:28,092
This one's been broken in.
Take it with you.

221
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,295
Would you like to go?

222
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:46,566
I'll leave in 10 minutes.

223
00:21:54,455 --> 00:21:56,155
Hey Ji Woo...

224
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:59,075
No wait, that's right...

225
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:15,698
Your mother was really good
at making maeuntang.

226
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:26,052
Today is their...

227
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:29,754
Your parents'...
Wedding anniversary.

228
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:51,367
I can still see it clearly.

229
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:55,587
She received that from your grandmother

230
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,918
and had such a smile on
her face as she put it on.

231
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:06,038
I asked her what was so
great about getting an old ring.

232
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,906
"It's the only one in the world.
Why wouldn't it be great?"

233
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:12,686
She said.

234
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,246
Child.

235
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:23,819
I'm sorry.

236
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:29,219
I took that mother away from you.

237
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:34,658
It was my stubbornness.

238
00:23:47,768 --> 00:23:50,448
<i>For you who have been chosen.</i>

239
00:23:50,568 --> 00:23:52,328
<i>Shinhwa Call.</i>

240
00:24:01,158 --> 00:24:03,298
What are you gonna do?

241
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:05,918
I don't know.

242
00:24:07,118 --> 00:24:10,200
My head's so muddled.
It's like a bomb went off in there.

243
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:13,918
What should I do?

244
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,018
What can I do?

245
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:18,231
You need to find out.

246
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,231
That answer...

247
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:23,091
You need to find that on your own.

248
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,251
If it was like old times,

249
00:24:27,371 --> 00:24:31,851
the answer in this situation
would have definitely been to get married.

250
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:36,831
How did we turn into guys
who have to worry about the obvious answer?

251
00:24:53,686 --> 00:24:57,286
In any case,
we're suddenly gonna be groomsmen.

252
00:25:20,424 --> 00:25:21,664
You alright?

253
00:25:21,784 --> 00:25:24,924
What?
You know what.

254
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:26,184
Jan Di.

255
00:25:26,304 --> 00:25:28,424
This time, it's actually marriage.

256
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,784
You know marriage isn't like
meeting for a couple of months

257
00:25:31,885 --> 00:25:34,485
then breaking up
or anything like that.

258
00:25:50,859 --> 00:25:54,039
That's their future.

259
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,979
That's the spot Gu Jun Pyo needs to fill.

260
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:08,235
Yeah, Mom.
Dad.

261
00:26:08,355 --> 00:26:11,415
You're all doing well, right?
San as well?

262
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:13,495
What?

263
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:17,958
You need to eat well.
You can't get ill.

264
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,915
Geez, really.

265
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:25,866
Yeah.

266
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,126
Don't worry about me.

267
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:34,246
I'm saying to please take care of yourself.

268
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,285
Don't be so miserly.

269
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:41,085
Eat some meat.

270
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:43,425
You got it?

271
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:46,942
Yeah.

272
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:10,227
Yes, Grandpa?

273
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:13,847
Now?

274
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:31,009
Oh, I'm sor...

275
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:35,789
What are you doing here?

276
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:38,601
What are you doing here, Sunbae?

277
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:40,101
Grandpa called me...

278
00:27:40,221 --> 00:27:42,241
Grandpa also called me...

279
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:49,745
Ah. What the?

280
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,265
Geez, what is this?

281
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:00,857
Excuse me.
What's going on right now?

282
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:02,997
Oh, it's a wedding picture couple contest.

283
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:06,463
They're tallying points with stickers
and the cutest couples get a prize.

284
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:09,783
And you get to wear a
wedding dress for free.

285
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:12,623
Prize?

286
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:25,392
I'm saying to please take care of yourself.

287
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:29,527
Don't be so miserly.

288
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:31,647
Eat some meat.

289
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:41,317
<i>{\a6}1st Place, Jeju Do trip,
2nd Place, Healthy Beef Set,</i>

290
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:41,318
<i>3rd Place Acne Treatment Machine</i>

291
00:29:41,437 --> 00:29:44,477
I'm bored.
Wanna try it?

292
00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:45,397
Huh?

293
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,797
Let's go.

294
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,800
Now, keep smiling and
maintain your poses. OK.

295
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,740
One, two...

296
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,771
<i>It's an F4!</i>

297
00:30:49,295 --> 00:30:51,195
The next two!

298
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,655
OK, that's good.

299
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:57,160
One... oh, a little more, a little more.

300
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,580
And a little more naturally.
Get into the mood. OK!

301
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,020
<i>That's good.</i>

302
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:10,042
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

303
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:57,489
Oh, Sunbae!

304
00:31:57,902 --> 00:32:00,482
Excuse me but it's just that
we have no reason to go to Jeju Island.

305
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,422
Could we exchange prizes?

306
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:03,862
Of course we can.

307
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:06,142
- Thank you very much.
- Please take it, Oppa.

308
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:07,822
Thank you.

309
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,763
Here.

310
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:15,683
Sunbae!

311
00:32:16,983 --> 00:32:19,103
You really...!

312
00:32:23,312 --> 00:32:25,872
Thank you, thank you.

313
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:16,783
<i>To all passengers, we will shortly
be arriving at Jeju International Airport.</i>

314
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:22,438
<i>Please secure all table
trays and fasten your seatbelts.</i>

315
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,469
Are you OK?

316
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:52,809
A day like this actually does come.

317
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:55,349
Jan Di came with us.

318
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:58,241
Do you guys think that
any of this makes sense?

319
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:02,581
Be it the monkey who asks
her to be the maid of honor,

320
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:05,681
or the girl who agrees to do it?

321
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:10,328
Right now, who do you think
is having the most difficult time?

322
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,320
Jan Di.

323
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,860
You came.

324
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,980
You actually came.

325
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,940
Thanks.

326
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,650
I know.

327
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:14,773
That Jun Pyo and you
really liked each other.

328
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:19,513
Unni...

329
00:37:21,086 --> 00:37:22,506
No.

330
00:37:24,386 --> 00:37:26,686
Even now,

331
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:30,026
I can't tell if you still
really like each other.

332
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:39,903
I'm sorry for pretending that I didn't know.

333
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:44,209
I'm not usually like that,

334
00:37:45,549 --> 00:37:49,069
but Jan Di, I was a little
cowardly towards you.

335
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,109
No, that's not it.

336
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,057
It's because I couldn't
be honest and tell you.

337
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,697
Well,

338
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:03,081
it's not that you didn't want to.
You couldn't.

339
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:04,981
Also,

340
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:09,121
even if you had told me,

341
00:38:09,861 --> 00:38:12,640
I doubt anything would have been different.

342
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,620
I...

343
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,660
probably couldn't have given up Jun Pyo.

344
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:31,166
I...

345
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:34,806
like you very much.

346
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:42,245
If someone asked me to pick the
two most precious people to me,

347
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:46,245
it would be Gu Jun Pyo and Geum Jan Di.

348
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,505
Unni.

349
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:52,816
That's why I'm really sorry.

350
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:57,276
For making your heart ache,

351
00:38:57,716 --> 00:39:00,296
I'll die trying to make it up to you.

352
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:02,916
Forgive me.

353
00:40:43,094 --> 00:40:44,734
Hey, Jun Pyo!

354
00:40:45,754 --> 00:40:47,694
Stop already and come over here!

355
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:49,534
Keep it up and you're gonna collapse.

356
00:40:49,654 --> 00:40:51,734
Who knows, he may be
trying to really collapse.

357
00:40:51,854 --> 00:40:54,071
Can we really leave him like that?

358
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:14,604
<i>How did you break up
with that person?</i>

359
00:41:14,984 --> 00:41:17,004
I don't know.

360
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,684
How do you think we broke up?

361
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:24,168
A while back, you asked me
if I confessed to him?

362
00:41:25,188 --> 00:41:27,908
I did confess to him.

363
00:41:29,328 --> 00:41:34,288
I tightly packed up more than
10 years of fighting with myself,

364
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:39,748
and just once, I mustered some
courage. On Valentine's Day.

365
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:46,549
Believing that if it were destined,
my sincerity would be understood,

366
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:50,388
it seemed as if I risked everything.

367
00:41:52,782 --> 00:41:55,742
So what happened?

368
00:41:56,242 --> 00:41:59,462
I wasn't able to reach that person.

369
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:01,922
My heart, that is.

370
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,620
The really amazing thing was,

371
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,880
after doing that,
my heart completely emptied.

372
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,680
Like the low tide receding.

373
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:17,248
I thought "So, it's only to here".

374
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:23,068
That moment that I let him go,
I felt liberated.

375
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:28,338
Like solving a math problem
after working on it for a long time,

376
00:42:28,768 --> 00:42:30,368
I felt refreshed.

377
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:32,047
And you weren't hurt?

378
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,617
Because I did everything,
without any regrets,

379
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:37,437
it didn't hurt.

380
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:45,003
So Ga Eul, you too should do everything
so that you don't have any regrets.

381
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,343
Strolling through a field of flowers.

382
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:52,063
Isn't the situation too urgent for that?

383
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:05,623
At this day and age, to suddenly
have a marriage of convenience?

384
00:43:05,743 --> 00:43:07,963
It doesn't seem like reality.

385
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,937
In our world,

386
00:43:10,057 --> 00:43:12,477
well, it's nothing to be surprised about.

387
00:43:12,597 --> 00:43:14,337
Sunbae,

388
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,977
do you also accept this
kind of future as a given?

389
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,597
I don't know.

390
00:43:19,326 --> 00:43:24,546
This future or that future,
there seems to be no difference.

391
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:28,746
With only one life to live,
how can you be so irresponsible?

392
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:33,130
Sunbae, because you're like this,
no one can stay with you.

393
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,790
Now that you know a little about
my family, my weaknesses,

394
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,130
you think that you know everything?

395
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,680
Why didn't you meet her?

396
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,880
3 years ago, on Valentine's Day.

397
00:44:30,262 --> 00:44:33,782
It's cold.
Let's go somewhere inside.

398
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,175
Today may be the very last day.

399
00:44:58,415 --> 00:44:59,975
Jun Pyo.

400
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:05,095
If you want to hold on to him,
there's no more time left.

401
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:17,444
Since getting to know you,
I've wished for only one thing.

402
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:23,344
That you'll be happy and not cry anymore.

403
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:29,342
Like the first time we met in the stairwell,
smiling brightly.

404
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:35,802
After tomorrow, you may not smile anymore.

405
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,400
So I'm afraid.

406
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,640
Don't worry.

407
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,020
I'll be able to smile.

408
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,172
I will smile.

409
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:54,392
Because Sunbae...

410
00:45:57,192 --> 00:46:00,079
Sunbae will be watching me.

411
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:09,767
I must have been out in the wind too long.

412
00:46:10,387 --> 00:46:12,587
My eyes are watering.

413
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:28,137
That's OK.

414
00:46:31,597 --> 00:46:35,217
Sunbae, because you
keep wiping them away,

415
00:46:35,517 --> 00:46:38,671
they're losing their discipline
and have no backbone.

416
00:47:38,704 --> 00:47:40,284
Oh, you scared me!

417
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:41,524
What are you doing?

418
00:47:41,644 --> 00:47:43,364
Who says I did anything?

419
00:47:43,484 --> 00:47:45,244
But this woman...

420
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:47,884
It's useless to play so hard to get.

421
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:49,624
Because in any event,
as of tomorrow, you'll be mine.

422
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:51,330
Yours? Who will be yours?

423
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,290
Stop being so cranky
and come downstairs.

424
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,150
Our parents are waiting.

425
00:48:06,752 --> 00:48:08,712
Ah, yes.

426
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:21,407
As of tomorrow, we will
truly become one family.

427
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:23,087
That's true.

428
00:48:24,387 --> 00:48:25,907
For Shinhwa and JK,

429
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:30,267
and also for our children's happiness,
shall we make a toast?

430
00:49:37,736 --> 00:49:39,776
How far are you willing to go?

431
00:49:41,756 --> 00:49:42,696
Noona!

432
00:49:43,836 --> 00:49:44,916
When did you arrive?

433
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:49,064
No need to happily greet me,
because I didn't come for your wedding.

434
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:53,244
I know. I'm pathetic, aren't I?

435
00:49:53,364 --> 00:49:54,784
Gu Jun Pyo.

436
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:58,548
I asked how far you are willing to go.

437
00:49:59,328 --> 00:50:00,768
How far does it have to be?

438
00:50:00,888 --> 00:50:02,408
Everything.

439
00:50:03,408 --> 00:50:05,988
Family, Shinhwa Group.

440
00:50:06,108 --> 00:50:09,462
And maybe, even the name "Gu Jun Pyo".

441
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,440
I couldn't do it.

442
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,660
After throwing everything away,
what would Gu Jun Hee be?

443
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,755
To live as nothing but one man's woman?
I didn't have the courage to do that.

444
00:50:30,955 --> 00:50:32,295
Noona.

445
00:50:33,515 --> 00:50:38,772
That one moment of cowardice
made things very difficult for me.

446
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,672
I thought that I could forget.

447
00:50:44,672 --> 00:50:46,492
But I couldn't.

448
00:50:46,612 --> 00:50:51,251
Do you still feel that
sorry for that person?

449
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:53,931
No.

450
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:59,411
He's not the one I feel sorry for.

451
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:02,771
It's the 20-year old Gu Jun Hee
whom I thought

452
00:51:02,872 --> 00:51:06,372
would always be dignified
and innocent.

453
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:23,509
Little brother,
whatever you decide, I'll understand.

454
00:51:24,169 --> 00:51:27,229
And wherever you go or whatever you do,

455
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:31,089
you'll always be my beloved little brother,
Gu Jun Pyo.

456
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:34,088
And that truth won't change.

457
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:25,551
Ji Hoo.

458
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:26,971
Say it.

459
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:30,051
You're a brother to me.

460
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:34,051
You were in the past.

461
00:52:34,171 --> 00:52:36,330
And going forward, you will be too.

462
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,010
I sometimes thought...

463
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,926
that you probably could
live just fine without me.

464
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:50,246
But how would I be without you?

465
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:51,806
Surely,

466
00:52:52,606 --> 00:52:55,407
you're not gonna ask
me to help you

467
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:58,808
run away from the ceremony
tomorrow, are you?

468
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:07,813
Hit me once.

469
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,353
What?

470
00:53:09,473 --> 00:53:11,213
I'm not joking.

471
00:53:11,893 --> 00:53:13,513
I should be hit by you.

472
00:53:13,633 --> 00:53:15,073
Jun Pyo.

473
00:53:35,018 --> 00:53:36,658
Jan Di...

474
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:39,943
I don't think that I can let go of her.

475
00:53:43,563 --> 00:53:45,523
Which one seems better?

476
00:53:45,643 --> 00:53:48,083
This one? If not, then this one?

477
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:51,303
They're all pretty.

478
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,483
You can't say that!

479
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:57,308
You have to tell the bride,
100% dispassionately and honestly.

480
00:53:57,428 --> 00:54:00,548
Saying that you like
everything is of no help.

481
00:54:02,248 --> 00:54:03,768
I'm sorry.

482
00:54:03,888 --> 00:54:07,994
But honestly, they're all pretty.

483
00:54:21,228 --> 00:54:23,308
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

484
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,100
Bride Ha Jae Kyung,
do you swear to take groom Gu Jun Pyo

485
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,000
as your husband, in good times and in bad,

486
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,642
to cherish and love forever?

487
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:47,222
I do.

488
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:53,705
Groom Gu Jun Pyo, do you swear
to take Bride Ha Jae Kyung as your wife,

489
00:55:53,825 --> 00:55:56,165
in sickness and in health,

490
00:55:56,585 --> 00:56:00,065
to cherish and love forever?

491
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:06,079
I can't.

492
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:10,959
I can't do it.

493
00:56:16,452 --> 00:56:18,252
Gu Jun Pyo.

494
00:56:19,072 --> 00:56:21,472
This is just a game.

495
00:56:21,592 --> 00:56:23,212
Why are you so serious?

496
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:25,452
It's not a game, Monkey.

497
00:56:26,012 --> 00:56:26,952
No.

498
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:32,912
Ha Jae Kyung,

499
00:56:35,396 --> 00:56:37,476
You can't get married to me.

500
00:56:38,216 --> 00:56:39,576
Jun...

501
00:56:40,336 --> 00:56:41,696
I'm sorry.

502
00:56:43,456 --> 00:56:45,318
Saying "I'm sorry" is enough?

503
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:50,518
Then in this world,
why do you think there are laws and police?

504
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:56,710
There's a woman I love.

505
00:56:57,718 --> 00:56:59,878
My first since I was born.

506
00:56:59,998 --> 00:57:06,039
And until I die,
she'll be the only one for me.

507
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,179
Knowing that, do you still want to marry me?

508
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:14,779
Are you crazy?

509
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:20,705
I know that the woman is Geum Jan Di.

510
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:23,445
But...

511
00:57:25,332 --> 00:57:29,212
I want that part of you even more.

512
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:37,896
It might be laughable but I like that
you're sincere and whole-hearted.

513
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:41,716
And because you're someone who
knows what love truly is.

514
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,756
I like you even more.

515
00:57:44,636 --> 00:57:46,716
That rival being Geum Jan Di...

516
00:57:48,102 --> 00:57:50,282
I can tolerate it.

517
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,882
I'm sure that it won't
be easy to forget her.

518
00:57:54,002 --> 00:57:55,242
However,

519
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:57,262
if I wait...

520
00:57:58,897 --> 00:58:00,837
if I wait and see,

521
00:58:01,997 --> 00:58:05,157
then wouldn't the next time
be a chance for me?

522
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:07,377
You can love me like that.

523
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:08,817
Ha Jae Kyung.

524
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:12,817
That'll be enough.

525
00:58:12,937 --> 00:58:15,617
I see there's more than enough
value in that investment.

526
00:58:34,172 --> 00:58:35,492
Gu Jun Pyo.

527
00:58:36,892 --> 00:58:38,552
Forgive me.

528
00:58:39,652 --> 00:58:40,952
No.

529
00:58:43,434 --> 00:58:44,974
Listen carefully.

530
00:58:46,114 --> 00:58:49,774
Tomorrow, in this place,
we're going to become husband and wife.

531
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:52,194
Whatever the past may be,

532
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:54,823
for the rest of our lives until we die,

533
00:58:54,943 --> 00:58:58,103
we're going to promise to love each other.

534
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:02,363
Therefore, even though
you beg me to forgive you,

535
00:59:04,392 --> 00:59:07,532
there's nothing for me to forgive.

536
00:59:14,712 --> 00:59:17,272
It's gotten late so quickly.

537
00:59:17,752 --> 00:59:22,132
Because of the make-up tomorrow,
they begged me to go to sleep early.

538
00:59:22,432 --> 00:59:24,412
I'll leave first.

539
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:34,743
Jun Pyo!

540
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:36,543
It's time.

541
01:00:36,663 --> 01:00:38,183
We should head down now.

542
01:00:48,627 --> 01:00:49,647
Woo Bin.

543
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,127
I need a favor.

544
01:00:52,247 --> 01:00:53,307
What is it?

545
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:55,767
Just break my arm.

546
01:00:55,887 --> 01:00:56,907
What?

547
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:57,967
Jun Pyo.

548
01:00:59,027 --> 01:01:00,887
There's no time.

549
01:01:02,547 --> 01:01:04,567
With your skill, one blow should do it.

550
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:06,327
Are you serious?

551
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:25,411
What are you doing right now?

552
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:34,054
Don't worry about it. Go outside.

553
01:01:34,174 --> 01:01:37,552
All that thinking and
this was the best you could do?

554
01:01:38,852 --> 01:01:40,592
If this is the only way that
you can stop the wedding,

555
01:01:40,693 --> 01:01:42,293
then maybe it's better that you go.

556
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:43,652
Geum Jan Di.

557
01:01:43,772 --> 01:01:45,312
You're being a coward.

558
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:47,732
You're not being dignified
in front of anyone.

559
01:01:47,852 --> 01:01:50,932
You're not confronting, you're running away!

560
01:01:52,232 --> 01:01:57,332
If you run away like this,
someday, everything will happen again.

561
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:03,147
Then tell me not to do it.

562
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:05,987
Tell me not to go!

Talk!

572
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:05,202
- We have to shoot it again.
- Do I have to go up to there?

573
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:07,341
Wait a minute.

574
01:03:13,186 --> 01:03:16,706
Wait a minute, please.
My shoulder is slippery so...

575
01:03:32,828 --> 01:03:35,028
Did I fall asleep?
Did you shoot that?
