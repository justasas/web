Episode 10

4
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,950
You must be new here.

5
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,360
I'm...

6
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,780
You...

7
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,550
Ga Eul!

8
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,120
You're here to meet me?

9
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,050
You should've dressed up like this before!

10
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,440
I really didn't recognize you.

11
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,510
Should we...go out?

12
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,670
Miss Ga Eul.

13
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,350
Do you know him?

14
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,790
No, I don't know who he is.

15
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,660
Ga Eul!

16
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,700
What relationship do you have with this guy?

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,930
The person who has my heart,

18
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,170
and won't return it, is this person right here!

19
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,140
Ga Eul, please stop making me suffer and come to me.

20
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,310
Ga Eul!

21
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,360
How much luck did that chick pile up in a former life.

22
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,450
Even though it's just acting,
shouldn't we go through with it to the end?

23
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,750
Yes, yes. Thank you!

24
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Master, one pumpkin porridge!

25
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:55,639
OK.

26
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,340
What is all this?

27
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,400
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

28
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,350
Don't you think it's a waste to not do anything?

29
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,040
Ooh. Who are you giving it to?

30
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,210
Me? Me?

31
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,150
Just...someone I am grateful to.

32
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,540
Hey Jan Di.
Aren't you giving Jun Pyo sunbae any chocolates?

33
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,860
Here, take this.

34
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,550
Why should I give him anything?

35
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,010
- Let me take this too.
- Hey, that's...

36
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,340
- This one too!
- No! You can't!

37
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,210
- Give me this too.
- That one you can't!

38
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,250
Hey! Look at the terrible state of this restaurant!

39
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,060
Disgraceful.

40
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,210
Philosophy on food.

41
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,350
Confidence of the Chef.

42
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:44,250
I can't find any of it at this restaurant.
How despicable.

43
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,830
Grandpa, our porridge is quite delicious.

44
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,650
{\a6}*Jjajangmyun = noodle with black-bean sauce

45
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,650
Jjajangmyun!

46
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,065
Grandpa, this is a porridge restaurant.

47
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,490
For jjajangmyun, you've to go to a Chinese restaurant.

48
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:58,210
Jjajangmyun!

49
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,500
Grandpa!

50
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:06,460
Grandpa, there is a restaurant near here.
You can go there.

51
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,520
Tell him to wait.

52
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,260
- What?
- What?

53
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,150
We can make jjajangmyun.

54
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,190
How is it?

55
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,460
I've never tasted such terrible jjajangmyun in my life.

56
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,500
How can you serve this horrible food to your customers?
And you call this a restaurant.

57
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,380
Who ask you to order jjajangmyun at a porridge restaurant?

58
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,800
But Grandpa, you still have to pay for the jjajangmyun.

59
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,173
How much do you think we should charge?

60
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:56,650
Since it was a special order,
we should ask for at least 5,000 won.

61
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,210
What is this?

62
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,950
Payment for the jjajangmyun.

63
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,885
Grandpa, you have to pay with money.
Not with this!

64
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,060
Why should I pay you money for that crap!

65
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,080
Take it!

66
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,465
Tell him to make some catfish soup next time!

67
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,075
- Huh?
- You're coming back?

68
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:23,750
What kind of people work here at this dirty rotten restaurant?

69
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,400
Goodbye!

70
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,990
Master!

71
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:33,650
What's up with that old man?

72
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,670
Master, don't think too much about it.

73
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,350
I'm sure that he's just senile.

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,700
But, that over there.

75
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,410
Can we try some?

76
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,050
- Delicious!
- Delicious!

77
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,950
Better than the other restaurant on our street!

78
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,870
He's not REALLY going to prepare catfish soup right?

79
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,280
Master!

80
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,850
<i>Tomorrow is Valentine's Day!</i>

81
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,990
<i>Would it not be a waste to let it pass by?</i>

82
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,200
<i>Who are you going to give it to?</i>

83
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,780
<i>Just, someone I'm grateful to.</i>

84
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,100
<i>But Jan Di. 
Aren't you giving Jun Pyo sunbae any chocolates?</i>

85
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,340
Chocolate?

86
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,710
Why did she talk about giving chocolate?

87
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,050
Why did you want to meet at a place like this?

88
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,090
What a bad choice in picking a place.

89
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,160
I asked you nicely to come out and meet,
so can't you just go along?

90
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,350
It's cold!
Let's go inside somewhere in the meantime.

91
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,970
- Follow me!
- Where are we going?

92
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,990
You want to drag me somewhere,
getting me in trouble again, aren't you?

93
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,240
Hey!

94
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,030
Where are you going?

95
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,340
It's fun and warm right?

96
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,690
The drinks are free here!

97
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,880
It wasn't made for a cheap customer like you.

98
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,970
The company's owner is lacking in good customer service.

99
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,060
I'm worried about the future of your company.

100
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
Hey, what's that?

101
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,720
This?

102
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:55,990
It's nothing.

103
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
Give it to me!

104
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,000
This is...

105
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,450
These are ones I messed up making it for someone else.

106
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,020
It doesn't look good, right?

107
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,080
But it tastes good.

108
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,540
I'm going to try one.

109
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,360
Hey!

110
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,790
They're all mine, don't touch it!

111
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,530
Yes, you've all waited long for this!

112
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,320
It is time for the Valentine's Day event!

113
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,940
We are starting right now!

114
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,910
Will all participants, please come forward now!

115
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,680
Yes, they must have been anticipating it,
everyone is running forward!

116
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,070
Here is the prize, we're giving away today!

117
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,470
Last call, last couple!

118
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,030
Here are they.

119
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,260
The economy must be really bad these days.

120
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,250
Many of you are coming forward
as soon as we announced it.

121
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:12,830
When I call to you,
please shout "Fighting".

122
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,422
- Number 1.

123
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:15,139

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,916

00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:16,800

00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,000
- Number 8.

130
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:20,605
- Number 9.
- Fighting!

131
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:24,446
The rules are simple.
Please put down your bags and purses first.

132
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,800
Either man or woman is OK.

133
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,180
Whichever couple can hold onto your partner the longest,
will be the winner.

134
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,070
Looks like all our couples are ready!

135
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,110
Get Ready!

136
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,110
One!Two!Three!

137
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,650
Yes, please begin to carry your partner!

138
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,065
This guy here, you need to bend down.

139
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:52,940
You're so stiff. Your hair is all wavy.
Gently. Hang on.

140
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,810
Yes, that's right!
As you hang on...

141
00:12:56,811 --> 00:13:02,640
Ah oh my! Just lie down already!
Couple 1 is out!

142
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:06,868
Only been 2 seconds and your face already turn red!

143
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,720
Now, let's start the game for real.

144
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,435
Wow, looking good.

145
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:16,240
Hey there, you lose.
Come out.

146
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:19,870
Uh, you lose.

147
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,660
Don't lift your foot until I say so.

148
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,590
This couple is down.

149
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,530
57 minutes have passed.

150
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,710
Two teams are left!
Who do you think will win?

151
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,910
How long do you think you can last?

152
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,320
We will last till the very end!

153
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,090
I see. And how long do you think you will last?

154
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,460
Till we win.

155
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,870
Until it's done?
Can you say how long you can last again?

156
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,160
- Till we win!
- Wow, good.

157
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,414
The young man is very determined.

158
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,230
So let's ask for an encouraging message from the girlfriend.

159
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,350
Ah, I see. No message,
but just that you feel good!

160
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,810
Hey, Dry Cleaner.
This is really embarrassing.

161
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,050
If they find out the president's son is doing this,
it'll be a scandal on the news tomorrow.

162
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,540
Hey, be quiet. You'll lose your strength!

163
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,940
If you need a cell phone, then tell me.
I'll buy you one!

164
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,420
My goal is to get it with my own ability.

165
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,500
It isn't your ability, but mine!

166
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,000
With our last two teams.

167
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,350
Why don't we have them do a squat. Up and down!

168
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,610
Up and down!

169
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,710
Up and down!

170
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,600
Up and down!

171
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,370
Beads of sweat are forming on the young man's forehead.

172
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,150
Wow, very impressive.

173
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,100
The last team, who shall it be?
We're anticipating...

174
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,050
Oh! Oh my, finally she's fallen off!
Finally, we have a winner!

175
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,880
Wow!

176
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,000
I knew this team would win from the start.
When they join in.

177
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,500
How do you feel?

178
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,410
I feel very happy about it!

179
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,700
I get a cell phone now!

180
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,000
Congratulations!
Please give them a round of applause!

181
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,390
Congratulations. Good job!

182
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,560
Let go.

183
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,870
Let go!

184
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,610
Let go, I can walk by myself!

185
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,430
Ga Eul, why are you here?

186
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,450
That is... I just...

187
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,520
She must've come here to give you some chocolate.

188
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,180
Is today Valentine's Day?

189
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,970
Miss, your nose is red!
You must've waited a long time!

190
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,550
Ga Eul, why don't you have some tea before you go.

191
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,940
No, it's OK!

192
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,160
Don't be like that and come inside.

193
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,870
I'll go prepare some tea.

194
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,920
Leave yours over there, too.

195
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,820
I'll leave first.

196
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:37,550
Let go of me, please.

197
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,560
This is why I dislike innocence like you.

198
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,910
Ga Eul, listen carefully to what I have to say.

199
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,430
Acting is just acting.
If you take it seriously, then we have a problem.

200
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,610
I'll hang on to this until Ga Eul meet the one destined for you.

201
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,130
Thanks!

202
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
Anybody called for a substitute driver?

203
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,560
How did you know I was here?

204
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,220
Like I said, I came because
someone called for a driver.

205
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,130
Huh?

206
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,430
Jun Pyo called me.

207
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,730
Thank you.

208
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,700
I'm going.

209
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,340
Geum Jan Di.

210
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,430
If something ever happens, will you tell me?

211
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,200
Like what kind of happening?

212
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,780
Well, I hope you don't have to. But...

213
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,920
Hopefully nothing does happen.

214
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,840
It's not like Gu Jun Pyo and I are serious or anything.

215
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,940
Drive safely.

216
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,320
Geum Jan Di.

217
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,930
Don't worry about me!

218
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,570
Are you taking the helmet with you?

219
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,050
Huh?

220
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,760
I was just going to give it back to you!

221
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,930
Here.

222
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,660
Goodbye.

223
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,080
Her father's a dry cleaner?

224
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,160
Mother's working at a public bath?

225
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,300
Yes, that is correct.

226
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,490
How did a girl like that get into Shinhwa High School?

227
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,120
Does that make sense?

228
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,610
Who's responsible for this?

229
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,910
You were the one who admitted her.

230
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,740
What did you say?

231
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,870
Do you know why the media is dangerous?

232
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,810
Because they are ignorant!

233
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,820
Once they bite into something, they won't let go.

234
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,660
Can't get through to them by common sense or sound judgment.

235
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,940
I have to bring in one of their own to calm them down.

236
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,510
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier.

237
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,490
I thought the Young Master was just bullying the Young Miss as usual.

238
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,250
Young Miss! Who is a Young Miss here?

239
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I apologize.

240
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,430
The Young Master would like to...

241
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,670
Don't bother that girl.

242
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,260
- What did you say?
- I said don't bother her!

243
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,220
I don't know what your talking about right now.

244
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,530
Ah! Are you talking about the girl we saw at the mall?

245
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,920
Do you think your mother is a person of leisure?

246
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,470
In my position, I have no time
to be concern about such trivial stuff.

247
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,400
The First Lady of Shinhwa Group!

248
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,770
If you say so, that's fine.

249
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,120
Get ready to leave.

250
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,120
I understand.

251
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,430
Like a ghost, I tell you.

252
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,340
You, where did you get that?

253
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,310
Don't know.

254
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,510
Where do you think I got it?

255
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,970
Hey! Don't eat that!

256
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,680
Ji Hoo.

257
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,980
Why do I feel uneasy?

258
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:13,320
I feel like something is going to happen to her.

259
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,450
What scares me most,

260
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,840
is that something bad could happen to her
and I won't know it.

261
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,880
Don't worry,

262
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,150
Geum Jan Di, you know she's not a weakling.

263
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,480
Don't be afraid either.

264
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,370
Behind you,

265
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,360
there will always be us.

266
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,080
The president of world class hotel chain La Vindor,

267
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,590
Mrs. Kang Hee Soo

268
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,840
has been elected as the president of the International Hotel Association.

269
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,850
Can you share your thoughts?

270
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,860
Until I become the best, I will never be satisfied.

271
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,360
Oh my, who is that?

272
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,280
Is that Jun Pyo's mother?

273
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,090
Shinhwa Group is definitely different, just as I'd thought.

274
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,410
Just look at that charisma.

275
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,870
What a heroine, a heroine.

276
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,440
Until I become the best, I will never be satisfied.

277
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,040
How is it? Was it alike?

278
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,180
We can be relatives through marriage.

279
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,410
- There might be a chance where I'll be like her.
- Just a little alike.

280
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,860
A little?

281
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,950
Is there somebody here?

282
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,150
- Older brother Jun Pyo?
- Young Master Jun Pyo?

283
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,980
Jun Pyo Son-in-law?

284
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,590
Older brother Jun Pyo?

285
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,650
She looks like someone I've seen before.

286
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,170
Just a minute ago, that woman on the TV news broadcast...

287
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,810
Until I become the best, I will never be...

288
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,990
Madame President!

289
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,070
Is somebody here?

290
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,480
You must be surprised

291
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,600
because I came over to meet you so suddenly.

292
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,870
No, not at all.
Young Master Jun Pyo... No,

293
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,590
Ah, thanks to your son, so we're used to it.

294
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,110
Jun Pyo has been here before?

295
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,310
Yes of course.
He didn't just come over.

296
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,180
He also spent the night here,

297
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,000
made Kim Jang, went to the bath...

298
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,690
I'll get straight to the point.

299
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,060
You're a busy person, so of course you should do that.

300
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,390
I believe that once a person is born,

301
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:32,460
there is a separate world that each person must deal with.

302
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,020
Jun Pyo is a child who must endure,
not only in the Republic of Korea nor in Asia,

303
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,720
but the whole entire world.

304
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,340
Of course.

305
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,390
Because Shinhwa Group is global!

306
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,700
And as a mother, I will do everything in my power
to ensure my son will be up to the task.

307
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,100
And in my duty as a mother.

308
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,440
Yes, of course you should.

309
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,530
If you were to raise Jan Di well...

310
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,900
Yes, as a mother as well, I will try my hardest

311
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,580
to raise Jan Di as a good match for Jun Pyo...

312
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,640
That's not what I meant.

313
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,360
But I am talking about the grass at a golf course.

314
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,090
Excuse me?

315
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,780
Do you know what is most important
when trying to grow good grass?

316
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,580
Food?

317
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,340
It's getting rid of the weeds.

318
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,630
It is very important to pull out by the roots
to get rid of the nasty weeds,

319
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,290
so it does not survive and
grow together with the grass.

320
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,030
By that, you mean...?

321
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,200
So are you saying our Jan Di is a weed?

322
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,470
It is a relief that you understand my meaning.

323
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,600
Normally, you spray strong pesticide first to get rid of the weeds,

324
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,740
but this time...

325
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,900
Section Chief Jung.

326
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,840
Yes, President.

327
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,740
{\a6} 300 million won = $220K

328
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,740
It is 300 million won.

329
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,500
Hundred million?

330
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,560
Hundred million...

331
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,360
Hundred million?

332
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,910
If you need more, I can give it to you.

333
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,260
Because it is also our fault for not raising our children properly.

334
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,300
- Chief Jung
- Yes.

335
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:46,720
[I pledge on February 2, 2009 that I will end my relationship with Gu Jun Pyo.
And I will not meet him than otherwise stated.]

336
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,170
It is a contract stating that you won't meet
Young Master Jun Pyo ever again.

337
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,480
All you need to do is sign.

338
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,290
Excuse me.

339
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,240
Honey!

340
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,470
Mom!

341
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,170
Get out right now!

342
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,500
You just made a big mistake.

343
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,620
Whether it be a big mistake or a small one,

344
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,450
It's better than calling someone's child a weed in front of her parents.

345
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,190
Get out right now!
Can't you hear me?

346
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,110
Kang San, what are you doing?
Call the police immediately.

347
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,330
What are you doing, honey?
Throw that money bag away right this instant!

348
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,430
Alright.

349
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,870
You won't regret it?

350
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,080
I'm not generous enough to offer it twice.

351
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,210
Meeting a woman like you twice is what I'm going to refuse.

352
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,800
Let's go.

353
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,090
Mom...

354
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,550
Honey.

355
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,060
Where did you get all that courage?

356
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,050
Mom, I was so moved.

357
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,250
I've never been more proud of you like tonight.

358
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,040
Your pride is more important than money.
How can you just sell it off with...

359
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,010
What are you talking about?

360
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,470
How can pride be more important than your money?
Of course your money is more important.

361
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,780
In a capitalist society,

362
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,290
first is money, second is money,

363
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,380
and third is money as well.

364
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,190
Pride my ass.

365
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,600
Honey.

366
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,430
Then why did you do that before?

367
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,890
That woman was telling us to get lost
for just 300 million won.

368
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,040
Is she joking with someone?

369
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,680
Even a three year old in the Republic of Korea knows Shinhwa Group,

370
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,520
and they're just giving us 300 million?

371
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,710
Then?

372
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,860
Imagine you do end up marrying to Young Master Jun Pyo.

373
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,510
No matter how much longer that woman lives,

374
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,560
is she going to live 1,000 years or 10,000 years?

375
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,080
Then the whole fortune would go to her son,

376
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,550
and all that becomes yours.

377
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,730
How dare she offer just 300 million?

378
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,960
Mom.

379
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,300
What?

380
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,140
You get a grip of yourself.

381
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,590
Our goal is Shinhwa Distribution, Shinhwa Airlines,

382
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,380
Shinhwa Electronics,
Cement, and Automobiles!

383
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,270
What else is there?

384
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,400
- La Vindor.
- Of Course!

385
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,260
Make that hotel yours too.

386
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,530
Mom.

387
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,310
What?

388
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,310
Who knows, 20 years later you'll be in the news!

389
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,870
<i>"There is no such thing as satisfaction</i>

390
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,080
<i>until you become the greatest."</i>

391
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,020
Yeah, that line!

392
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,840
Leave it to my mom!

393
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,690
Honey.

394
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:22,350
I really didn't know you had such depth.

395
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,040
It's enough that you know now.

396
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,610
<i>Do you know what is most important
when trying to grow good grass?</i>

397
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,980
<i>It is getting rid of the weeds.</i>

398
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,530
<i>It is very important to pull out by the roots
to get rid of the nasty weeds,</i>

399
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,010
<i>so it does not survive and
grow together with the grass.</i>

400
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,900
Do you have concert tickets?

401
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,430
What are you doing here so late?

402
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,200
What about you?

403
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,500
What are you doing here so late?

404
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:51,490
I didn't hear that swimming has changed to a Winter Olympics sport now.

405
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,220
I just...

406
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,420
Because you were frustrated?

407
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,030
If you don't have tickets,
why don't you at least turn the pages for me?

408
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,200
I won't wear it home today.

409
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,890
Why are you looking at me like that?

410
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,040
Just...

411
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,500
Because I'm amazed.

412
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,500
At what?

413
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,200
That whenever an alarm rings in my heart,

414
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,020
Sunbae always appears in front of me.

415
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,300
An alarm?

416
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,170
Like when there's a fire?

417
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,270
Yes.

418
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,320
Then let me do it.

419
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,500
Do what?

420
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,650
Geum Jan Di's famous firefighter.

421
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,280
I'm indebted to you today again.

422
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,630
Go safely.

423
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,010
[Pick up the phone!]

424
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,020
Yeah, Mom.

425
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,690
What is it?

426
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,390
Don't cry and tell me slowly so that I can understand.

427
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,090
What?

428
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,060
Why are they suddenly telling you
to close up the dry cleaners business?

429
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,380
The owner's son, who has been without a job for 7 years,

430
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,820
will be hired at Shinhwa Electronics.

431
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:05,170
Realtor President Yoo said no one will lease us the space in this area.

432
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,870
If she had something against us,

433
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,430
she should have just talk to us personally.

434
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,690
But how can she stab us in the back so cruelly

435
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,060
taking away the means of our livelihood and survival?

436
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,630
She did come and talk to us.

437
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,150
But you poured salt all over her and chased her out.

438
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,370
So what are you going to do?
What do you want me to do?

439
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,540
What will our family of four going to do to eat and live?

440
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,230
- What is this?
- This is our first day,

441
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,520
so our future depends on how well we do.

442
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,150
What are you going to do? Start!

443
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,090
We have hot coffee! Hot coffee! Coffee!

444
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,180
Dad!

445
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,110
Squid! Dried squid!

446
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,750
What is that?

447
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,150
Shout it loudly like you normally do.

448
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,900
Squid has arrived!

449
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,700
Make your expression brighter.

450
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,380
Fresh squid on a crowded highway!

451
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,960
- I'll do it.
- Jan Di.

452
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,520
Rice crackers!

453
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,290
Rice crackers!

454
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,340
Rice crackers are here! Rice crackers!

455
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,600
- Go up to the driver and make him roll down the windows.
- You have to say how much they are.

456
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,900
- You have to say how much they are.
- You can just tell them when they ask.

457
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,900
Quickly, let's do a fighting.

458
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,980
Aja aja fighting!

459
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,280
Squid is here!

460
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,200
Rice crackers!

461
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,470
It's 3,000 Won!

462
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,860
Rice crackers are 2,000 won.

463
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,770
2,000 Won!

464
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,150
2,000 Won!

465
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:56,760
Rice crackers are here..

466
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,190
Rice crackers...

467
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,980
Mom, what are you doing?

468
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,540
Rice crackers? Coming!

469
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,500
Rice, rice crackers...

470
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,330
Mom, I can't hear anything!

471
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,800
Give it to me.

472
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,650
Rice crackers! Rice! Rice! Rice crackers!

473
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,110
Do it.

474
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,890
Rice crackers... rice, rice, rice.

475
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,890
Do it a bit louder.

476
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,200
Rice crackers! Rice! Rice! Rice!

477
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,900
I got it.

478
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,840
Ahjumma, give us one rice cracker.

479
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,360
Aren't you going to give us one?

480
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,950
Mom! Rice crackers!

481
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,270
- Yes, it's 2,000 won.
- Here you go.

482
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:44,590
Thank you.

483
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,870
Rice crackers!

484
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,580
Why do I have to go there?

485
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,540
Just go on your own like usual?

486
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,100
What a nuisance.

487
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,890
I'm not the successor to Shinhwa Group. You are.

488
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,220
Why is there such a traffic jam?

489
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,900
Do we have to go this way?

490
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,670
Section Chief Jung, let's buy one of those.

491
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,040
Excuse me?

492
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,520
What do you call those round things
they're selling on the road?

493
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,010
Are you talking about rice crackers?

494
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,510
Yes, that's it.

495
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,740
Are you in your right mind?

496
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,670
President Kang is going to buy rice crackers from the side of the road?

497
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,880
Are you feeling sick?

498
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,090
Section Chief Jung.

499
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,760
Yes, President.

500
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,580
Excuse me!

501
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,440
Please give us one rice cracker.

502
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,380
Yes!

503
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,330
It's 2,000 won.

504
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:18,050
Thank you.

505
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,330
President, what shall I do with these?

506
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,450
The smell and the dust.

507
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:46,530
Really, selling food in such revolting conditions is beyond understanding.

508
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,650
Throw it away immediately.

509
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,470
Yes.

510
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,420
Miss, one coffee!

511
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,090
Miss!

512
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,040
Noona, what are you doing?
He's asking for a can coffee!

513
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,630
Yes, coffee!

514
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,840
Rice crackers...

515
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,820
2,000 won.

516
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,410
Stop the car.

517
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,030
- Just keep going.
- Stop the car.

518
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,250
There's no need to stop the car.

519
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,010
Can't you hear me telling you to stop the car?!

520
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,810
Gu Jun Pyo.

521
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,720
Geum Jan Di, stay still.

522
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,800
Please, stay still.

523
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,940
You're doing well, my daughter.

524
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,560
Why didn't you tell me?

525
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:56,820
If I told you,

526
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,700
you were going to pull out of bundle of cash and asked,

527
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,630
"How much do you need?"

528
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,850
If the Dry Cleaners went broke,
you guys can just set up another one.

529
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,930
It's embarrassing...!

530
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,800
You're right.

531
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:19,350
Sure, I'm...
No, our family must be embarrassing.

532
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,510
But I'm not sorry for any of it.

533
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,650
What I mean...

534
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,800
You and I dating is separate from the family.

535
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:35,130
And you can't have everything your way,
just because you're my boyfriend.

536
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,460
Then what do you want me to do?

537
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,570
You just want me to watch your whole family
selling rice crackers on the street?

538
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,660
Yeah.

539
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,330
Just watch.

540
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,500
What?

541
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:54,120
Don't do anything, just watch,
if you want to remain my boyfriend.

542
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,350
Hey, Dry Cleaner.

543
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,510
It's been a while since I've heard that.

544
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,670
But what should I do?

545
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:10,250
I'm not a dry cleaner's daughter anymore.

546
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,950
Geum Jan Di.

547
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,260
I'm not trying to scare you,

548
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,440
nor is there a reason for you to be afraid.

549
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,400
Just know this.

550
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:31,690
My mom, our evil witch, is capable of doing anything, anytime.

551
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,070
It seemed like it.

552
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,860
Promise me.

553
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,680
What?

554
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,990
That if something ever happens, you'd tell me.

555
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,360
OK.

556
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,070
One more.

557
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,380
That no matter what,

558
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,800
you won't run away from me.

559
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,560
I don't think I can promise you that.

560
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,640
What?

561
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,430
I feel like running away several times not because of your mother,

562
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,850
but because of you.

563
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,290
Hey!

564
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,920
I promise.

565
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,970
I'll promise that I won't let your mother become the reason.

566
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:33,630
It's a relief that you're Geum Jan Di.

567
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,100
What?

568
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:42,400
It's a relief that the commoner gangster Geum Jan Di is my girlfriend.

569
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:48,990
That promise really sets my heart at ease.

570
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,680
What is that?

571
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,170
Is it a compliment or an insult?

572
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,430
Do you want to drink this?

573
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:05,950
Hello?

574
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,130
I heard that you were looking for an overnight part timer...

575
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,380
Oh, I see.

576
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,070
I understand.

577
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,590
Pumpkin porridge is ready.

578
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,710
Yes.

579
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,130
Here is the pumpkin porridge you ordered.

580
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,610
Enjoy your meal.

581
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,470
It's super hot, so blow on it as you eat.

582
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,260
Miss, you're very friendly.

583
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,580
Please come often.

584
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,890
Our porridge is very good.

585
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,130
Oh, you've a very cute face.

586
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,480
Are you a college student?

587
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,030
No, I'm a high school student.

588
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,600
Ah, then it'll be a bit difficult.

589
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,290
What will be?

590
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,370
Our company uses a lot of student models,

591
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,380
and I liked your image a lot.

592
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,340
I see.

593
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:18,670
I was wondering,

594
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:22,770
how much money do you pay?

595
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:45,290
Oh my. Welcome gentlemen.

596
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:48,380
What can I get you?
Canned coffee or puffed snacks?

597
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,500
No, that's not right.
Seeing you guys, you came for the squid.

598
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,690
How many do you want?

599
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,910
Who give you permission to operate here?

600
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,880
Hey, guys!
Do it right!

601
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,720
Yes!

602
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,450
Do you really think that she'd do that?

603
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,840
It's bothering me.

604
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,320
Then you can check.

605
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:33,890
Let me borrow your phone.

606
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,260
Phone?

607
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,260
Why? Yours ran out of battery?

608
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,980
Hello?

609
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,930
Hello? Yi Jung Sunbae?

610
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,440
Yi Jung Sunbae?

611
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,790
Hello? Hello?

612
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,710
Yes, Miss Ga Eul.

613
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,340
Hi.

614
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:05,940
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,000
Hello.

616
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,100
How much do you need?

617
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,220
Fill it up, please.

618
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,400
How will you be paying?

619
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,550
Sunbae

620
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,850
I was getting really sleepy.

621
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,640
Thank you, Sunbae.

622
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,410
Aren't you overdoing it a bit?

623
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:47,200
Don't you know me?

624
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,650
It's me, me!

625
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,960
Republic of Korea's commoner representative, Geum Jan Di.

626
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,910
If you take away health and stubbornness, I'm just a corpse.

627
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:56,800
Lies.

628
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,860
What?

629
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:01,320
Your body's telling you that it's a lie.

630
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:13,980
I have a lot of tissues.

631
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,230
My heart hurts.

632
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,500
If I was Jun Pyo, then my heart would hurt a lot.

633
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:42,830
Please don't tell Gu Jun Pyo.

634
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:48,910
I want to carry my own share of responsibility.

635
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,840
Then I'll be able to hold my head up high.

636
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,870
I envy Jun Pyo.

637
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,620
I'm off.

638
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,910
Hey, Geum Kang San!

639
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:34,450
You're starving because you don't have any lunch money, right?

640
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,980
Geum Kang San is a bottomless pit,
so what will he do when he gets hungry?

641
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,590
What are they...?

642
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,750
Let's go.

643
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,490
Hey, Kang San.

644
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:44,920
Are you starving yourself?

645
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,940
No.

646
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,790
Tell me quickly.

647
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,660
Or else I'll go and find you at your school.

648
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,390
I just told them I wouldn't eat lunch,
because I didn't want to spend money.

649
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,350
My teacher was going to pay for me,
but I don't want that either.

650
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,300
Why'd you say that now?

651
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,010
In the morning, you deliver newspapers and milk.

652
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:08,430
In the afternoon, the porridge shop.
In the evening, the gas station.

653
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,350
How can I tell you?

654
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:12,450
I won't die by skipping one meal.

655
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:14,450
I'm off.

656
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,160
Hey.

657
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:18,160
Hey, Geum...!

658
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,360
He's so tiny to begin with...

659
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,690
My heart hurts.

660
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,980
Sorry.

661
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,320
Thank you.

662
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:53,120
Excuse me.

663
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:03,370
Excuse me.

664
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,790
Is there anybody here?

I'm sorry.

675
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:47,030
There is something that I must reveal to all of you.

676
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,070
What's wrong with you?

677
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,520
Not yet.

678
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:55,720
Really.

679
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,660
Good shot!

680
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,880
Hit it like this.

681
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,920
What are you doing?

682
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:06,050
Nice shot!

683
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,790
Really!

684
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,160
You!

685
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,030
You really wanna die?

686
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,700
Since early in the morning...

687
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,570
How should I do?

688
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,450
They're so good.

689
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,320
I'm sorry.

690
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,240
Really, I'm sorry.

691
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,700
Hey, listen to me!

692
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,110
