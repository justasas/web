The Korean Corporation,
Shinhwa Group has been selected,

00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:08,765
to be the largest corporate
sponsor in the 2011 London Olympics.

<i>South Korea's economic growth started, it has
maintained the status of the best company,</i>

12
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:31,457
<i>If you are a citizen of South Korea,</i>

13
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,673
<i>you know the two letters of Shinhwa
before you know the president's name,</i>

<i>and have created a kingdom and
therefore is Korea's largest conglomerate.</i>

15
00:00:40,936 --> 00:00:42,058
Hello, this is Shinhwa.

16
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:49,584
<i>On a day where they had managed
to increase their imports by one trillion Won,</i>

17
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>and were sent to the Blue House, the founder of
this company instead of receiving a medal said,</i>

18

<i>{\a6}*Blue House = Korea's White House</i>

19
00:00:55,701 --> 00:01:01,002
<i>"Sir, please allow me to build a school
where my grandchildren could attend."</i>

20
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:05,580
<i>And then, there it was, Shinhwa School.</i>

21
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:08,500
<i>The first school in the history of Korea
to be backed by the president,</i>

22
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,150
<i>who believed that economic advancement
was more important than education,</i>

23
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:15,659
<i>and even went to make special laws
to accommodate the school.</i>

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,800
<i>And now there is a saying,</i>

25
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:24,367
<i>if you do not have Shinhwa School
on your resume, don't even bother applying.</i>

26
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>It is a School made for the 1%,
attended by the 1%, and fit for the 1%</i>

27
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:32,834
<i>and therefore has maintained
the reputation of the best elite school.</i>

28
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:37,237
<i>Most common people,
even if they apply when they are born,</i>

29
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:38,942
<i>they cannot get in to the
Shinhwa Kindergarten,</i>

30
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:40,200
<i>but when accepted,</i>

31
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:46,279
<i>then you have the way paved nonstop for Elementary,
Middle and High school, and even University.</i>

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,319
<i>It is subject of jealousy and awe
for the rest of the nation's students,</i>

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,600
<i>and parents who suffer from
the hard admissions to universities.</i>

34
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:58,354
<i>However, in this Shinhwa High School,</i>

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,820
a school for the chosen,
something unimaginable was happening.

36
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:34,294
<i>Oh my, Min Ha!</i>

What is the purpose of your visit?

42
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:08,968
Ah yes...

43
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:13,901

44
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,281

<i>Let's go!</i>

50

Hey!

52

The roof! The rooftop!

53
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:45,974
Lee Min Ha is at the rooftop now!

54
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:47,181
What? Really?

55
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,568
- Is he putting on some kind of show?
- No, he's covered with blood.

56

<i>Oh, really?</i>

57

58
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:56,005
Lee Min Ha?!

59
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:18,695
<i>What did I say?</i>

60
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,127
He wouldn't last a week.

61
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,961
Hey, at least he lasted three weeks.

62
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:26,824
<i>But he resisted three days</i>

63
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,036

64
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,667

69
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:12,053
Me?

70
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:17,285
Well, speaking for myself,
I've come to deliver your clothes!

71
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:20,557
Jan Di Dry Cleaners, 30,000 Won, please!

72
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:30,587
Okay, okay, 20,000... 5,000 Won

73
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:34,477

But you better become a regular.

<i>{\a6}*service = doing things for free so it attracts customers.</i>

75

When I'm dead, you can bill it to my house.

76
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,028
Now, don't be like that...

77
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:45,425
D...d...d... dead?

78
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:48,186
You're gonna die now?

79
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,835
Why?

80
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:58,282
Why? You go to such a great school.

81
00:07:58,938 --> 00:07:59,976
No, this isn't a school,

82
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,587
it's hell.

83
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:03,439
Excuse me!

84
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,766
Real hell is outside of this building.

85
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:11,093
Have you heard of admissions hell?

86
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,645
Have you heard of F4?

87
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:19,062
F... F...what?

88
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,156
F4?

89
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:23,436
What is that?

90
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:29,596
The moment you get a red card from them,
you become a prey for the entire school.

91
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,286
Remember it.

92
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:37,251
Ah...ah...ahhh

93
00:08:37,534 --> 00:08:39,491
You can't just let them do that to you!

94
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:44,647
It's always the lame losers
who walk around like they're the shit.

95
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:49,563
If it was my school,
I would have grabbed them and break them!

96
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,072
They're fortunate; your friends.

97
00:08:58,306 --> 00:08:59,568
Huh?

98
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:02,257
That they have a friend like you.

99
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:06,024
Well... I suppose so.

100
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:12,131

00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:47,374
It's a pleasure to meet you.

173
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,591
I didn't push him

174
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:54,495
Really, it was the F4 or something,
they were the ones who were...

175
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:55,737
I am here just to,

176
00:13:55,964 --> 00:14:00,058
Jan Di, our daughter,
don't be too surprised.

177
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:04,823
Starting from tomorrow,
you will be attending Shinhwa High School!

178
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:07,121
You will be attending there!

179
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:10,562
W... what?

180
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:13,242
- It's because...
- The CEO was very impressed with you.

181
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,468
They will accept you as a
special scholarship student!

182
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,175
They will accept you!

183
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,645
Scholarship student?

184
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:20,797
Why me?

185
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:22,124
We believe that Jan Di...

186
00:14:22,349 --> 00:14:26,157
Noona, you were on the swimming team
up till Junior High, they want you to swim again!

187
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,832
Swim again!

188
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,436
No.

189
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:33,918
What?

190
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:34,843
Why not?

191
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,718
Noona, have you lost it?

192
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,961
I'm just fine with how things are now...

193
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:42,868
<i>I don't belong in that kind of school.</i>

194
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,896
So I don't really want to attend...

195
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,749
So if you would kindly go back...

196
00:14:49,365 --> 00:14:50,722
Jan Di?

197
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,334
Please reconsider.

198
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:56,344
No, she doesn't need to reconsider
she will be attending starting tomorrow.

199
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,734
Then we will see her at school.

200
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:14,251
No matter what happens I will send her.

201
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,364
Please make sure she does.

202
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:22,787
Mr. Secretary...

203
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:28,139
You are aware of the phrase Nak Jang Bool Ip?

204
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:28,039
<i>{\a6}*in card game, can't retrieve the card once you threw it</i>

205
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,281
Mom!

206
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,505
Don't yell!

207
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:57,569
If you have eyes, look at that!

208
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,090
Shinhwa High!

209
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:05,900
Shinhwa High!

210
00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:07,682
Shinhwa High!

211
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:09,293
Shinhwa High!

212
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,529
Shinhwa High!

213
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:16,797
Noona, who knew that this day would come?

214
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:20,596
For the first time in my life,
I am proud to be your brother.

215
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:28,752
Even though they are like this,
do you think you can still say you don't want to go?

216
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:32,029
And, do you know how
much their tuition costs?

217
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:33,245
I still don't want to.

218
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,001
Mom, I really don't want to!

219
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:40,403
Other people go crazy because even if they
have money and brains, they can't get in...

220
00:16:40,623 --> 00:16:42,616
But how come you don't want to?

221
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,199
Don't you remember when you said that

222
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:47,934
the rich people are showing off their money
by building a school just for them?

223
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:52,685
That was when it was someone
else's situation and I was jealous.

224
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:59,971
Hey, this is basically money falling from the sky,
who wouldn't want to accept it?

225
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:03,988
I don't know, but something seems iffy.

226
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,503
Whatever you say, I'm not gonna go
so you better accept that, okay?!

227
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:17,971
<i>But, you liked to swim.</i>

228
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:22,283
You said you wanted to go to
a school with a swimming pool.

229
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,781
What do you take me for?

230
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:28,780
Do I look like a kid who's gonna be sold
by the idea of a swimming pool?

231
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:29,785
<i>I'm not going.</i>

232
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:30,750
I don't want to.

233
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,437
I can't go!

234
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:51,020
Wait.

235
00:17:51,606 --> 00:17:54,020
Please wait one moment, miss.

236
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,950
I will be going now.

237
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,896
Geum Jan Di, fighting!

238
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,480
Get going now.

239
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:28,148
<i>Dry cleaning is here, dryyyy cleaningggg...</i>

240
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:34,356
<i>Jan Di dryyyyyy cleaningggg...</i>

241
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:41,145
<i>Dry cleaning is here, dryyyy cleaningggg...</i>

242
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:45,458
<i>Jan Di dryyyyyy cleaningggg...</i>

243
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,984
Isn't this earring really pretty?

244
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:37,627
There are only two of these shirts in the nation,

245
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:40,152
one is here and do you know who else got the other one?

246
00:19:40,153 --> 00:19:41,503
Who?

247
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,865
Gu Jun Pyo.

248
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:45,033
That's crazy!

249
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:47,400
Don't you think I pull it off better?

250
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:48,599
Lend it to me.

251
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:50,395
Me first, me first!

252
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:09,630
Where is it?

253
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:44,883
Uh... Where is the swimming pool?

254
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:50,381
Ah, over there!

255
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:52,183
Thank you!

256
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,724
Excuse me, please continue
with what you were doing

257
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:02,725
Bye.

258
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:23,663
<i>It's the F4!</i>

259
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:40,027
<i>Move over!</i>

260
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:44,421
Is, there a problem?

261
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:46,486
I'll give you three seconds.

262
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:49,569
Huh? What?

263
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,528
Three...

264
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,170
Two...

265
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:57,420
One.

266
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:06,144
Woo Bin, any of that juice left?

267
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:07,984
Yeah.

268
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,267
Want me to give it to you?

269
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:41,692
<i>Are you okay?</i>

270
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,301
What a crazy bastard!

271
00:24:56,602 --> 00:24:58,894
Are all these people on mute or something?

272
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:01,236
Why are they just standing
there not doing anything?

273
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:03,574
Oh... My... God...

274
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,696
I can't believe what I'm hearing

275
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:10,585
Who are you guys?

276
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,571
Us?

277
00:25:13,181 --> 00:25:15,695
Oh, we haven't introduced ourselves yet.

278
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,832
We are...

279
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:19,735
Ginger.

280
00:25:20,356 --> 00:25:21,521
Sunny.

281
00:25:21,791 --> 00:25:23,272
Miranda.

282
00:25:23,512 --> 00:25:26,366
You can call us the
Three Beauties of Shinhwa High.

283
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:37,663
That's that, you said crazy beeping something, you
weren't referring to our F4, scholarship student?

284
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:40,957
F... F what?

285
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:47,491
So the people who publicly humiliated that kid,
that was the infamous F4?

286
00:25:47,739 --> 00:25:51,868
Infamous? More like famous!

287
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:55,988
If you don't watch your mouth,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

288
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:03,209
You guys own a Laundromat.

289
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:07,554
Not a Laundromat, dry cleaning.

290
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:09,975
What about it?

291
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,946
It's my first time looking at a
dry cleaner's daughter,

292
00:26:13,983 --> 00:26:17,583
it's so fascinating.

293
00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:24,522
Look all you want, I won't charge you.

294
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:33,640
Since it's your first day here and you are
a clueless common girl, we'll let it slide.

295
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:34,641
What?

296
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,726
Speaking ill of our F4 Princes!

297
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:39,744
What, I can't do that?

298
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:42,354
I mean, what's so great about them?

299
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:49,284
Wow, transfer student, do you really
have no idea how great the F4s are?

300
00:26:50,794 --> 00:26:52,511
No, I don't.

301
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:02,441
Guys, let's go.

302
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:18,498
Song Yoo Bin,

303
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:22,533
a bluechip in the construction business,
he is the successor to the Il Shin Construction.

304
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:24,417
<i>There is even a rumor that
half of Jeju Island is the company's,</i>

305
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:26,217
<i>that this company is a huge
construction conglomerate.</i>

306
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:31,640
<i>And has a 50 year history of gangs
and the family of the Il Shin gangs?</i>

307
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:34,970
<i>They still have a hold of a fair
amount of luxury night clubs,</i>

308
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:39,237
<i>and have a large control
over the real estate values.</i>

309
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:45,489
<i>Soo Yi Jung, he was the youngest
artist to debut at the Biennale</i>

<i>and is a gifted ceramist that

312
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:52,538
<i>UNESCO selected him as
one of the best young artists.</i>

313
00:27:53,527 --> 00:27:57,197
<i>Well at least there is one member
who actually does something.</i>

314
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,116
<i>Don't think that all geniuses are poor.</i>

315
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,537
<i>National treasures that appear in our textbooks,</i>

316
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:08,072
<i>and the country's biggest art museum
is Yi Jung's grandfather's.</i>

317
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:09,420
<i>Woo Sung Museum?</i>

318
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:11,040
<i>That is their family's?</i>

319
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:12,895
<i>How much is all that?</i>

320
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:16,238
<i>Don't try to know too much,
you're gonna get hurt.</i>

321
00:28:22,427 --> 00:28:25,895
This is the old, old president's photo.

322
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:29,271
Do you see the little kid sitting beside him?

323
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:33,114
That's F4's Yoon Ji Hoo.

324

325
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:42,147
<i>So Yoon Ji Hoo is
President Yoon Suk Young's grandson?</i>

326
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:45,088
<i>Do you know the Su Am Art Center
where Jang Yoon Joo played?</i>

327
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:51,115
<i>They own the Su Am Cultural Foundation,
a European soccer team, and a Major League team.</i>

<i>I am the most jealous of
this guy in the entire world.</i>

329
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:58,403
<i>You already know who this is, right?</i>

00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:15,281
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

F4! You guys are like flies!

338

If you are born that blessed you should
shut up and live your lives gratefully,

339
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:30,462
and some one like you
who has no common sense

340
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:36,797
is the successor of the Shinhwa Group
is a public nuisance to the nation!

341
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,530
You! I warn you.

342
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:42,407
Don't show your face in front of me.

is the day I am driving off the rooftop,
I swear I will!

345
00:31:07,714 --> 00:31:09,287
It's Yoon Ji Hoo...

346
00:31:11,844 --> 00:31:14,443
You are also a nuisance.

347
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,504
I can't sleep because it's so noisy.

348
00:31:19,817 --> 00:31:23,275
I'm sorry, I thought no one was here.

349
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,277
Is that really true?

350
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:28,819
Huh?

351
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:31,152
That you're gonna dive.

352
00:31:34,757 --> 00:31:40,412
What I mean by that was...
did you hear everything?

353
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:42,598
What?

354
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,226
What I said...

355
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:49,754
Gu Jung Mool?
Or the part about the flies?

356
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:01,663
Oh, right, it's Jun Pyo.

357
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:04,474
Huh?

358
00:32:04,695 --> 00:32:07,943
It's Gu Jun Pyo, not Gu Jung Pyo.

359
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:12,880
If you're gonna attend here,
you should at least know the name properly.

360
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:33,865
They're rice balls.

361
00:32:34,145 --> 00:32:35,288
You eat rice balls?

362
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,318
Rice balls?

363
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,662
<i>They're so good. They're pretty too.</i>

364
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:53,163
Oops. What kind of smell is this?

365
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:55,073
<i>It's so foul.</i>

366
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:00,249
<i>Here.</i>

367
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,740
Oh... My... God.

368
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:04,404
Terrible.

369
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:09,404
Transfer student, why are you
eating such a terrible lunch box?

370
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,028
Can't you see that?

371
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:13,559
I see it.

372
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:14,842
Then why?

373
00:33:18,053 --> 00:33:22,710
It's impossible for me
to eat a 50,000 Won lunch.

374
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:29,061
Then, you're planning to continue eating this foul lunch?

375
00:33:29,312 --> 00:33:30,485
I'm planning on that.

376
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,043
Oh my God.

377
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:50,250
Good.

378
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,564
<i>It's F4!</i>

379
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,863
<i>F4!</i>

380
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:56,565
Mi Suk, quickly.

381
00:34:10,072 --> 00:34:15,878
Is it okay if I eat one of those?

382
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,318
<i>Please come again.</i>

383
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,287
Thank you.

384
00:34:34,753 --> 00:34:36,005
She came from Germany?

385
00:34:36,289 --> 00:34:38,942
Yeah. She's so pretty too.

386
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,726
I thought she was a doll.

387
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:43,900
That's a relief, you found a friend quickly.

388
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:47,441
I was worried that you'd be a loner.

389
00:34:50,945 --> 00:34:52,100
I'm a loner.

390
00:34:52,363 --> 00:34:53,176
What?

391
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:55,195
You're right that I'm a loner.

392
00:34:56,317 --> 00:35:00,099
But I'm so thankful
that they don't pay attention.

393
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:05,034
I'm planning on stuffing myself
in a corner until I graduate.

394
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,942
Who are you?

395
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:11,177
Where did our Jan Di go?

396
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:15,903
The girl that taught the SGA students a lesson
when they bothered me in kindergarten,

397
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:18,652
<i>the girl who fought against a disorderly girl
that robbed me in middle school...</i>

398
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,744
that was all strong girl Geum Jan Di.

399
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:22,160
But what?

400
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,069
Then what should I do?

401
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:29,903
I'd probably get beaten to death by my mom
even before I get kicked out of school.

402
00:35:29,966 --> 00:35:30,860
Really, this girl.

403
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:37,852
You think I have cucumbers to spare
that I'm sticking them on your face?

404
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,113
<i>Your dad told me
that he wanted cucumber sorbet,</i>

405
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:43,007
<i>but I'm investing them on your face.</i>

406
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:45,542
Did I want to get invested on?

407
00:35:45,966 --> 00:35:48,740
Think about it.
If you become a skin beauty,

408
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:51,500
the worst off boy in that school,

409
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:55,235
is still probably the best candidate for a
husband in any matchmaking company.

410
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,307
<i>If it's like that, then of course
it's a huge investment.</i>

411
00:35:57,526 --> 00:35:58,621
Isn't that so, honey?

412
00:35:58,622 --> 00:35:59,874
Don't talk to me.

413
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,141
I'm catching some awesome angles.

414
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:07,588
Hey! Look at this girl.

415
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:13,952
Why are you ironing the uniform?

416
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:17,832
You said that your arm
hurt after ironing all day.

417
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:23,402
This is the best clothing I've seen in all 15 years
I've been doing the dry cleaning business.

418
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:28,793
Normal people can't even wear
this kind of clothing to a wedding.

419
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:30,939
Why are you doing that?

420
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:33,568
Noona, can't you lend me this once on Sunday?

421
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:39,335
Jan Di, consider this kind of designer clothing
as an inheritance.

422
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,932
When you sit down, be careful.

423
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,336
You have to be careful not to get any stains on it.

424
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:46,822
Got it?

425
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:51,239
This kind of thing is my daughter's.
Why would my arm hurt?

426
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,375
Daddy's arm doesn't hurt at all.

427
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,954
That girl...

428
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:05,599
Honey, make sure to iron
the inside material as well.

429
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:13,962
Strong girl Geum Jan Di didn't die yet.

430
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:18,276
Loner this way, loner that way.
Since I'm a ruined body anyway,

431
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:21,217
I'll live by saying
the things that I need to say.

432
00:37:21,712 --> 00:37:23,270
F4!

433
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,888
You're all dead starting tomorrow.

434
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,684
<i>It's F4!</i>

435
00:37:42,968 --> 00:37:44,324
<i>Where?!</i>

436
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:15,503
Sunbae Jun Pyo.

437
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:19,080
I baked this myself to give this to you.

438
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,709
Please accept my heart.

439
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:47,728
Our Jun Pyo doesn't eat anything
unless it's baked by a personal patissier.

440
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:19,449
What are you?

441
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:22,442
Do you have something to say?

442
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:24,769
Yeah, I do have something to say.

443
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,675
And I have a lot at that.

444
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,012
You!

445
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,737
Don't you have even
the slightest manners for humans?

446
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:39,177
I don't even expect a little modesty
from someone who has so much.

447
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:41,147
If you don't want to eat it,
you can just reject nicely.

448
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:42,332
Or...

449
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:46,800
Does it hurt to just think about the sincerity
of the person who made it and just accept it?

450
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:52,508
What are you going to do if she says that
she's going to fall off the roof, you bastard?

451
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:54,270
<i>What are you?</i>

452
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,481
Do you have something to say?

453
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,418
No.

454
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:27,560
Why do you swim like that?

455
00:41:27,794 --> 00:41:29,337
<i>You're going to faint.</i>

456
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,024
I was getting a punishment.

457
00:41:31,307 --> 00:41:32,369
Punishment?

458
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:35,902
What did you do so wrong?

459
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:40,622
A punishment a strong girl
is giving for being so cowardly.

460
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,184
Do you feel better now?

461
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:46,901
Yeah.

462
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:52,266
The reasons for why I go to
this school are right here.

463
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:54,902
What are they?

464
00:41:56,173 --> 00:42:01,306
This swimming pool and Oh Min Ji.

465
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:29,716
Su... Sunbae.

466
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,307
I apologize, Sunbae Jun Pyo.

467
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:39,990
You're sorry?

468
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:43,491
If everything works out by saying sorry,

469
00:42:43,703 --> 00:42:47,351
then why would there laws in the world
and why would there be police?

470
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:52,927
I'll buy you the same exact
shoes for you right away.

471
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:56,317
You, do you have more money than me?

472
00:42:56,555 --> 00:42:58,027
Excuse me?

473
00:42:58,323 --> 00:43:00,702
Even if you did, you wouldn't be able to.

474
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:03,983
These shoes were made
by a craftsman in Firenze,

475
00:43:04,198 --> 00:43:07,074
so how would you buy me the
same exact ones right away?

476
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:09,732
I apologize.

477
00:43:10,736 --> 00:43:12,824
Then I'll do whatever I can.

478
00:43:13,046 --> 00:43:14,237
Whatever you can?

479
00:43:14,848 --> 00:43:16,132
Yes.

480
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:22,235
Lick it.

481
00:43:25,784 --> 00:43:26,951
Excuse me?

482
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,186
I told you to lick it.

483
00:43:33,189 --> 00:43:34,349
Sunbae...

484
00:43:34,575 --> 00:43:36,730
Didn't you say that you'd
do everything you can?

485
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:45,516
Won't you stop?

486
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:53,544
Hey... did she fall because she wanted to?

487
00:43:53,786 --> 00:43:56,128
If she apologized, then that's enough.

488
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,766
What is this?

489
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:00,684
Hey, second year.

490
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:03,387
I don't think it's been long
since you've been here,

491
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,140
but American style is restricted here.

492
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:09,387
You words are a little short.

493
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:09,303
<i>{\a6}(*Referring to her lack of
formality to an upperclassman)</i>

494
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:15,488
Ahh, is that so?

495
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:18,843
So you're that wonder crap
that they've been talking about?

496
00:44:19,232 --> 00:44:24,067
I was hoping for an S-line D-cup sized girl
when I heard Wonder Woman.

497
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:28,667
That's a total disappointment.

498
00:44:29,558 --> 00:44:31,779
What a relief I disappointed you.

499
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,376
Is it your concept to not know
your place and mind others' business?

500
00:44:35,669 --> 00:44:37,202
Why do you step into other people's affairs?

501
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,699
She's not a stranger. She's a friend.

502
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:40,812
In a wealthy person's dictionary,

503
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:44,261
I'm assuming they don't carry words like
"friend" or "friendship", do you?

504
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:45,698
<i>Friendship?</i>

505
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:50,385
Let's watch some of that powerful friendship.

506
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:55,234
Lick it.

507
00:44:58,826 --> 00:44:59,722
What?

508
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,075
If you lick it instead,
I'll forget it ever happened.

509
00:45:39,798 --> 00:45:41,262
What are you?!

510
00:45:43,848 --> 00:45:46,221
Do I have more money than you?

511
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,672
Did you earn all that money?

512
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:49,976
What?

513
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:55,025
Is minding other people's business my concept?

514
00:45:55,026 --> 00:46:00,191
My concept is not leaving people who leech
off of their parents' back alone! Got it?

515
00:46:16,722 --> 00:46:21,416
At our place it's 2,500 Won, but I calculated
it according to Kang Nam's rates.

516
00:46:21,668 --> 00:46:24,816
But if the stain doesn't get out,
then send it to us.

517
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,314
<i>What is that?</i>

518
00:46:46,532 --> 00:46:48,665
What the heck is that thing!

519
00:47:18,374 --> 00:47:19,826
What's wrong with Jun Pyo?

520
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:22,610
I think it must've been too much
of a shock for him today.

521
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:24,868
He's been like that all day.

522
00:47:37,602 --> 00:47:38,475
What are you doing?

523
00:47:38,696 --> 00:47:40,250
With that serious face.

524
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:41,606
Don't touch me.

525
00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:43,960
Can't you hear my head working?

526
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:46,239
Jan Di or Jap Cho...

527
00:47:44,274 --> 00:47:46,210
<i>{\a6}(*Jan Di is grass while Jap Cho is weed)</i>

528
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,311
I'm thinking of a way to really step on her.

529
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:53,948
Why are you thinking so hard?

530
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:56,011
Just do like you always did.

531
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:04,503
Rascal, you're so smart.

532
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:22,574
Jan Di Cleaners...

533
00:48:22,824 --> 00:48:25,046
You're so dead now.

534
00:48:53,524 --> 00:48:54,682
It's come out again!

535
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,548
Second grade Class B Geum Jan Di.

536
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:59,194
<i>She got chosen by the F4 red card.</i>

537
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,406
Is it a soccer field here?

538
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,601
What red card.

539
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:37,292
Hello?

540
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:39,888
Hello, crazy.

541
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:42,541
Looks like your desk isn't here.

542
00:49:42,807 --> 00:49:44,508
Your desk must not be here.

543
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:47,290
How could a common person like you study with us?

544
00:49:47,587 --> 00:49:49,710
Why did you come to our school?

545
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:52,870
My book.

546
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:54,465
Move, move.

547
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:34,190
You're dead today.

548
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:05,186
Who did this?

549
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:08,451
If you have anything to say, come out.

550
00:51:08,937 --> 00:51:10,342
Who is it?

551
00:51:26,175 --> 00:51:29,839
Jan Di, consider this kind of
designer clothing as an inheritance.

552
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:33,020
When you sit down, be careful.

553
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,640
This kind of thing is my daughter's.
Why would my arm hurt?

554
00:51:37,868 --> 00:51:39,933
Daddy's arm doesn't hurt at all.

555
00:51:46,493 --> 00:51:49,120
Do it more. More!

556
00:51:49,685 --> 00:51:51,455
Try to do it more!

557
00:52:13,653 --> 00:52:16,391
Hey, hey. Someone bring some oil.

558
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,340
All we have to do now is fry her.

559
00:52:18,608 --> 00:52:21,204
Then what is that? Squash pancake?

560
00:52:29,468 --> 00:52:32,858
Do it more!

561
00:52:59,498 --> 00:53:01,484
Isn't it all over now?

562
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:02,692
What do you mean over?

563
00:53:02,915 --> 00:53:06,505
That girl needs to come to me
and kneel down. Then it's over.

564
00:53:08,662 --> 00:53:12,178
So did anybody tell you to touch
the whisker of a sleeping wolf?

565
00:53:13,258 --> 00:53:15,257
Wasn't it a lion?

566
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:17,731
<i>It looks like she won't even last a week.</i>

567
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,164
A week? I say three days.

568
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:25,041
Yi Jung, the tea ware That
was on display last time.

569
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:26,967
You have to hand it over to me.

570
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:29,816
A guy who can't even distinguish
between a tea ware and a vase.

571
00:53:29,817 --> 00:53:30,858
What a surprise.

572
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:35,997
Our baby is a fan of So Yi Jung.

573
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:40,371
Okay. If I win, give me
Super Girl's phone number.

574
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,568
Call.

575
00:53:41,787 --> 00:53:43,369
Shut up you two.

576
00:53:43,618 --> 00:53:45,385
It's about time she got here.

577
00:53:46,534 --> 00:53:47,932
Now...

578
00:53:48,947 --> 00:53:55,394
Five, four, three, two, one.

579
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:57,870
<i>Tada!</i>

580
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:04,737
Right.

581
00:54:04,753 --> 00:54:09,953
It'd be embarrassing to come out
looking like that in front of me.

582
00:54:09,954 --> 00:54:11,518
I was a little too quick.

583
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,851
Again.

584
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:21,984
Five... Four... Three...

585
00:54:25,726 --> 00:54:27,411
Two...

586
00:54:31,176 --> 00:54:32,813
One.

587
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,328
What are you guys doing?

588
00:54:42,554 --> 00:54:44,349
Did you guys do it right?

589
00:54:45,223 --> 00:54:47,313
Then why isn't she coming?

590
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,393
Where did that girl go?

591
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:54,139
Surrender?

592
00:54:54,485 --> 00:54:56,257
Surrender, my ass.

593
00:54:56,524 --> 00:55:00,265
Since I'm Jan Di, you think it's okay
to step all over me like that?

594
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,595
You touched the wrong person.

595
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:07,513
Have you guys ever eaten dumplings
boiled from your own tears?

596
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,813
Have you ever mastered
how to freestyle in a tub?!

597
00:55:11,178 --> 00:55:13,983
Korea's common people cannot survive without
the spirit of rivalry and patience.

598
00:55:14,138 --> 00:55:16,395
How many egg crates is this?

599
00:55:21,702 --> 00:55:27,117
These guys don't know
that flour is gold dust.

600
00:55:27,401 --> 00:55:29,914
They really want to die.

601
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:32,556
So wasteful.

602
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,712
How much is it for just one crate?

603
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,727
Oh my!

604
00:55:42,988 --> 00:55:43,896
Who's there?

605
00:55:45,461 --> 00:55:49,028
<i>You're really noisy every time I see you.</i>

606
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:57,366
You, do you know how to make hot cakes?

607
00:55:57,677 --> 00:55:58,740
Huh?

608
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:00,587
Hot cakes (pancakes).

609
00:56:05,913 --> 00:56:12,882
You make a batter out of
flour, eggs, milk and sugar,

610
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:14,669
and you fry them.

611
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:16,616
Like Bin Dae Dduk.

612
00:56:17,692 --> 00:56:19,524
That's pretty simple.

613
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,974
Your handkerchief.

614
00:57:04,523 --> 00:57:05,951
I don't need it.

615
00:57:06,744 --> 00:57:09,429
I'll return it to you next time.

616
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:14,025
I'm not coming here anymore.

617
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:16,244
It's not as quiet anymore.

618
00:57:16,575 --> 00:57:18,633
Thanks to a certain someone.

619
00:58:30,577 --> 00:58:33,105
<i>Sorry, Jan Di.</i>

620
00:58:33,332 --> 00:58:37,674
<i>Please forgive a cowardly me.</i>

621
00:59:07,305 --> 00:59:09,965
I think I'll have to take
30,000 Won for this.

622
00:59:10,938 --> 00:59:15,010
I perfectly know how much it should be.
That's not how it is, Ahjussi.

623
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,117
Uniforms are expensive from the start.

624
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,420
And look at the state of these clothes.

625
00:59:19,649 --> 00:59:22,403
I cut the cost down a lot
because it's a uniform.

626
00:59:22,404 --> 00:59:27,928
Really... I'm a junior of
the cleaners business.

627
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,347
If you don't like it, then too bad.

628
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,072
There's another cleaner called
Jan Di's cleaners next door.

629
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:33,323
Go there.

630
00:59:35,332 --> 00:59:38,011
Why are you being like this, Ahjussi?

631
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:42,163
25,000 Won?

632
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,719
Bon appetite.

632
01:00:09,908 --> 01:00:13,919
Yo, yo, yo. Wazzup man?

633
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:17,459
They only take one group per week,

634
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:22,333
so I'm still waiting after I reserved
a month beforehand.

635
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:24,835
How did you do it?

636
01:00:43,221 --> 01:00:45,187
This one is better.

637
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:49,056
You're right. It's a beauty.

638
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,374
Enough to make your cuisine even finer.

639
01:00:52,623 --> 01:00:55,283
And just who told you that I was a chef?

640
01:00:59,812 --> 01:01:02,969
Your delicious looking hand.

641
01:01:15,521 --> 01:01:17,626
Does a player know everything
just by looking at a woman's hands?

642
01:01:17,859 --> 01:01:20,961
You're a player if you know the
3-star chef in Michelin Guide.

643
01:01:21,263 --> 01:01:23,659
No wonder, my bro, yo!

644
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:38,708
Yeah.

645
01:01:39,185 --> 01:01:41,209
Are you doing what I told you to do?

646
01:01:42,938 --> 01:01:45,376
Don't make a mistake and do it right.

647
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,001
Got it?

648
01:01:57,485 --> 01:01:59,251
Let's eat.

649
01:02:02,477 --> 01:02:03,836
Cheers.

650
01:02:12,852 --> 01:02:13,668
Mom!

651
01:02:14,257 --> 01:02:20,140
Everyone else is going crazy with their diets,
but what's going on here?

652
01:02:20,447 --> 01:02:22,893
Mom, are you satisfied if I risk my life
to such worthless thing?

653
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:28,562
You have to diet and get yourself a good body
to catch the eyes of the young gentleman.

654
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:31,221
<i>Do we have a lot of money
or do we have a good household name?</i>

655
01:02:31,222 --> 01:02:32,487
Or are you smart?

656
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,520
How dare you take dieting so lightly?

657
01:02:34,521 --> 01:02:36,026
Give me the rice bowl.

658
01:02:36,247 --> 01:02:37,432
I can't hand it over.

659
01:02:37,769 --> 01:02:40,965
I want to be surviving
rather than dieting right now.

660
01:02:42,286 --> 01:02:46,582
Swimmers need to have a good
body if they want to become stars.

661
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:48,270
<i>Didn't you see Kim Yuna?</i>

662
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:51,451
How can a young person
like you not know the trend?

663
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:53,957
Give me the rice bowl, you girl!

664
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,745
Give it to me!

665
01:02:58,276 --> 01:03:00,803
Mom, Kim Yuna's a figure skater, though.

666
01:03:01,029 --> 01:03:04,007
Kim Yuna's not a swimmer,
but a figure skater!

667
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:05,678
Stop!

668
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:08,784
<i>Hey!</i>

669
01:03:09,101 --> 01:03:12,472
<i>Give me the rice bowl!</i>

670
01:03:13,562 --> 01:03:15,435
<i>Hey!</i>

671
01:03:16,049 --> 01:03:19,649
<i>Jan Di. The rice bowl.</i>

672
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,561
<i>Jan Di.</i>

673
01:03:35,081 --> 01:03:36,939
Do I weigh more?

674
01:03:39,379 --> 01:03:41,286
I do a little.

675
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:45,490
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

676
01:03:47,868 --> 01:03:50,824
I'm going to endure it because
of the swimming pool.

677
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:56,739
If I went to this kind of school to begin with,
I would've gone to the Olympics.

678
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,303
What is this?

679
01:04:23,617 --> 01:04:25,867
What is all this?

680
01:04:26,432 --> 01:04:29,507
Gu Jun Pyo!

681
01:04:35,345 --> 01:04:38,359
Why does he keep smiling
to himself like that?

682
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:41,906
Her top must be off by now.

683
01:04:42,155 --> 01:04:43,623
Who?

684
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,594
Cleaner, by chance?

685
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:48,111
Still?

686
01:04:48,367 --> 01:04:50,967
Hold on, how long has it been?

687
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:53,015
It's been past a week.

688
01:04:53,344 --> 01:04:56,452
Okay. Give me her number.

689
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:58,999
She does last a long time.

690
01:04:59,231 --> 01:05:03,747
Isn't she the first to really stand up to F4?

691
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:08,829
What did she do?
It's because I'm going easy on her little by little.

692
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:11,433
How come I can't see Ji Hoo anywhere?

693
01:05:11,656 --> 01:05:14,719
He must be stuck in a corner
somewhere sleeping.

694
01:06:37,978 --> 01:06:40,055
Let go!

695
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:43,991

<i>What? You can't even find her?</i>

703
01:07:09,496 --> 01:07:11,111
<i>What kind of guys are you?</i>

704
01:07:11,374 --> 01:07:14,020
<i>They say one of the girls
at your school is pregnant.</i>

705
01:07:14,502 --> 01:07:15,436
<i>What?</i>

706
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:18,687
<i>Hey everyone... can't you smell
something bad somewhere?</i>

707
01:07:18,937 --> 01:07:21,051
<i>Hey! Geum Jan Di!</i>

708
01:07:21,294 --> 01:07:25,031
You acting like this to a girl
is funny and childish.

709
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,843
I think one person is a little different.

710
01:07:29,372 --> 01:07:31,158
<i>Who is that?</i>

711
01:07:32,644 --> 01:07:37,952
That girl... no matter how much I think about it,
I think she's totally into me.

712
01:07:38,202 --> 01:07:39,053
What?

713
01:07:39,282 --> 01:07:41,469
<i>Good looking, tall, smart and wealthy.</i>

714
01:07:41,754 --> 01:07:44,219
How can you not like Gu Jun Pyo?

715
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:46,489
Aren't you a total idiot?

716
01:07:49,155 --> 01:07:51,093
<i>He's waiting for you.</i>

717
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:52,647
<i>Who?</i>

718
01:07:52,878 --> 01:07:54,841
<i>Your prince.</i>

719
01:07:57,155 --> 01:07:58,825
<i>This must be a dream, right?</i>

720
01:07:59,052 --> 01:08:02,529
I'm not sure. Isn't it quite amusing?

721
01:08:04,493 --> 01:08:05,809
<i>Why on earth are you here?</i>

722
01:08:06,046 --> 01:08:08,445
Is it odd to find me at my own house?

723
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:10,961
<i>Whenever I see you,
it's so noisy and annoying.</i>

724
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:17,116
<i>Do Ji Hoo sunbae and the model,
Min Seo Hyun know each other?</i>

725
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:22,393
<i>To Ji Hoo, she's an existence like
his first love, lover, and mother.</i>

726
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:24,549
<i>Geum Jan Di!</i>

727
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:28,952
<i>Ju-Jun Pyo!</i>

728
01:08:29,163 --> 01:08:31,489
Gu Jun Pyo sunbae fell into the pool!

729
01:08:31,735 --> 01:08:32,853
Wake up, Gu Jun Pyo!

730
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:35,344
Open your eyes, Gu Jun Pyo!
