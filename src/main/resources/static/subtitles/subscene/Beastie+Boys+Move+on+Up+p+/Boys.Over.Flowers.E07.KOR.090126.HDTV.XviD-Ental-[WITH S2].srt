00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:19,383
Gu Jun Pyo!

4
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:20,844
Hey!

5
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:23,741
Hey!

6
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:24,935
Hey!

7
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,449
Stop!

8
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:46,883
Hey!

9
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:49,289
You!

10
00:01:50,147 --> 00:01:51,051
How did you!

11
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:56,190
Let's talk Gu Jun Pyo.

12
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,632
I have nothing to say.

13
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:01,559
And I told you to never talk to me again.

14
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:02,970
I have something to say.

15
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't.

16
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,268
I do!

17
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,123
Hey!

18
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:08,971
Stop! Go away!

19
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,235
I said I have nothing to talk about.

20
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:11,802
I said I do!

21
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:13,166
Hey!

22
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:15,633
- Gu Jun Pyo!
- Move! Move!

23
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:17,123
Gu Jun Pyo.

24
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:17,940
Gu Jun Pyo!

25
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,405
Get away from me you Sticky Girl!

26
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:22,545
Gu Jun Pyo!

27
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,326
I said I have something to say!

28
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,559
Gu Jun Pyo!

29
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,185
Hey!

30
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,527
Gu Jun Pyo!

31
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:30,769
Gu Jun Pyo!

32
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:33,730
Hey, Gu Jun Pyo!

33
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,949
Gu Jun Pyo, where are you going!?

34
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:37,276
Gu Jun Pyo!

35
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:38,654
Gu Jun Pyo!

36
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,895
Get in.

37
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:46,239
What?

38
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,325
Hurry and get in.

39
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:48,860
You have to catch him right?

40
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,351
Yes.

41
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:00,460
Do you have a death wish?

42
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,196
Stop it! Stop!

43
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,127
You still haven't had enough?

44
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:26,825
Who taught you treat girls in that way?

45
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:29,427
Noona, you don't even know anything!

46
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:31,951
Noona?

47
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:42,293
Sorry. I'll apologize for
my immature brother.

48
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:47,260
Lets go home first and
you can tell me all about it.

49
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,519
I...

50
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,528
She's banned from my house!

51
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:54,750
Do you want to get banned?

52
00:05:58,543 --> 00:05:59,715
Let's go.

53
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,325
I said she's not allowed in the house!

54
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,488
Careful on your drive back.

55
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,452
Eat a lot you guys.

56
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:46,429
It's been so long, hasn't it?

57
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:54,815
He refuses to come down.

58
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:58,050
He won't die from skipping a meal.

59
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,604
<i>So?</i>

60
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:07,015
The thoughtless child that has decided
on fasting has started a juvenile war?

61
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,550
And you guys all consented?

62
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,921
I'm against it.

63
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:13,869
I can't standby and watch
F4 split up like this.

64
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,272
I'm not exactly for it either, but...

65
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:22,272
Okay, that's enough.

66
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:23,248
Butler Lee.

67
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:24,356
Yes Miss?

68
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:29,080
Beijing Duck, Shanghai crab and
Beluga caviar that my honey sent

69
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,681
bring them out all.

70
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:30,374
Oh...

71
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:32,002
Don't forget a bottle of Cristal.

72
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,547
Yes, I understand.

73
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:35,219
I'll bring that out right away.

74
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,757
Jan Di, eat a lot okay?

75
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:43,303
If you're going to go against that idiot,
you're going to need your strength.

76
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:52,467
For the idiot bachelor upstairs, cheers!

77
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,750
I am really thankful for today.

78
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,600
I'll accept that thanks later.

79
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,365
But...

80
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,851
Why are you being...

81
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:21,449
So nice to you?

82
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,934
You've met my mother right?

83
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,511
Yes.

84
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:33,406
It's probably just as hard
to get into heaven as

85
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,407
it is for a rich person
to have true friends.

86
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,897
But, my mother even believes
that you don't need a friend.

87
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:43,277
Why?

88
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,840
No one would be ever good
enough to be a friend to the

89
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,041
heir of the Shinhwa group.

90
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:50,989
Nor could there be a friend.

91
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,696
But Gu Jun Pyo has F4.

92
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:55,893
That's right.

93
00:08:56,249 --> 00:09:01,003
For someone with such a high status
and is lacking in nothing.

94
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:05,426
It's more like a miracle to
have something like F4.

95
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,737
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,432
It's because of me that he's losing F4.

97
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:17,743
He would leave his friends like this.

98
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:21,276
Plus, I'm actually thankful to you.

99
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,847
Excuse me?

100
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:27,375
You opened up a road for
him to be more human.

101
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:33,685
If friendship is a sufficient condition,
love is a necessary condition.

102
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,075
Get yourself ready.

103
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:40,752
Starting tomorrow,
it'll become really hectic.

104
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,155
Goodbye.

105
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,223
Bye!

106
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,567
<i>Let's go.</i>

107
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:18,836
How can they not say one word about eating?

108
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:22,685
Butler Lee, this old man

109
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:24,729
doesn't even bring me a snack

110
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,724
I'm so hungry.

111
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,731
Young Master.

112
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,360
Are you really going to be like this?

113
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:41,953
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:45,003
Take it back.

115
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:54,711
Ah! I'm so hungry!

116
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:03,490
<i>Let's talk.</i>

117
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:49,191
Do you remember how many times
we've seen this movie together?

118
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,832
It's been at least ten times.

119
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,067
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,695
I know an apology isn't enough.

121
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:06,205
But...

122
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:08,233
But?

123
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:10,929
Leave Jan Di alone.

124
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:18,771
What are you going to do if I don't?

125
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,316
I'm going to protect her.

126
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,477
I have to protect her.

127
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,181
It's been eleven times.

128
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,185
If you remembered that we're
friends that have seem that movie

129
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:41,286
eleven times together...

130
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:45,706
then something like this
should've never happened.

131
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,399
You better be prepared.

132
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:10,363
<i>It's Gu Jun Hee!</i>

133
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,776
Are you going to expel them or...

134
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:22,603
Or?

135
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,417
Should I fire you first?

136
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:28,912
<i>Won't you stop!</i>

137
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:36,443
How dare you! You're insane!

138
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,512
Why are you bothering me even at school?

139
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:44,473
How dare you try to fire the principal?

140
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,136
Sure, go ahead.

141
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,969
Then should I be the next principal?

142
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:52,331
How would you like to graduate under me?

143
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,908
Don't even make such a dumb joke.

144
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:56,288
My little brother.

145
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:58,977
We may have bad tempers.

146
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:02,122
But we're really not the type to make
such useless jokes, now are we?

147
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,567
Shut up and follow me.

148
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,822
Noona! Noona!

149
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:15,619
You guys follow me too.

150
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:17,225
Noona! It seriously hurts!

151
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,174
Who is that?

152
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:30,023
Isn't that Gu Jun Hee sunbae of Shinhwa?

153
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:31,710
Yeah!

154
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:39,483
The legendary "Charisma Queen", Gu Jun Hee!

155
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:45,251
Her pose is even different from ours!

156
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:50,177
She's wife to the man that owns
the greatest hotel in the world!

157
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,216
She's so praise worthy.

158
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:57,227
The type of guy I hate the most?

159
00:14:58,249 --> 00:14:59,737
<i>A disgraceful guy.</i>

160
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,270
A stingy guy.

161
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:02,788
A guy that can't let go of the past.

162
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:06,080
A guy that brags about himself?

163
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,200
A disgraceful guy.

164
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:11,556
<i>A guy that never forgives his friends?</i>

165
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:13,378
A stingy guy.

166
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:16,322
A guy that can't accept his defeat?

167
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:19,072
A guy that can't let go of the past.

168
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,629
Okay, then.

169
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:23,129
You two will have a competition.

170
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:25,392
Gu Jun Pyo, Yoon Ji Hoo.

171
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:27,690
You guys can compete with
sports and the loser will have

172
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:28,691
to consent to the winner.

173
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,672
What competition?

174
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:32,215
<i>Who said I would do it?</i>

175
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:33,331
I'm against it.

176
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:35,499
I agree.

177
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:38,472
No matter what I agree...

178
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:42,624
I agree too.

179
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:46,047
Thanks Noona.

180
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,482
I agree too.

181
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,469
Who said you guys have the right to vote?

182
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:55,743
It's a void.

183
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,226
It makes no sense. No!

184
00:15:57,427 --> 00:15:58,259
Five to one.

185
00:15:58,379 --> 00:15:59,581
Bang Bang Bang.

186
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:00,392
Pass.

187
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,370
How can you do that!

188
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,164
Then, I get to decide what we compete in.

189
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,556
But that wouldn't be fair.

190
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,456
Don't worry.
I already have everything ready.

191
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:19,747
You can bring it in now.

192
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:41,390
The ten balls in here all have a paper
with a different sport written on it.

193
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,490
Some of them you have attempted,
and some you have not.

194
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:46,978
What's that!

195
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:48,792
Do things we've already done before!

196
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:53,253
No matter what category, one would
have an advantage over the other.

197
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,358
So technically, the competition starts
from the decision of each category.

198
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,621
You've heard that luck is skill too, right?

199
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,735
Is the competition only once?

200
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,143
Wouldn't that be a bit disappointing?

201
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,599
Two out of three, how does that sound?

202
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,257
I'll accept.

203
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,313
I'll do it! Okay?!

204
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:23,356
I'll announce the category two days
in advance of each competition day

205
00:17:23,357 --> 00:17:24,557
in front of all of you.

206
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:29,326
No matter how disadvantageous you
may be because of a category,

207
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:30,527
you must consent.

208
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:31,487
Okay?

209
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:37,132
The three in the triangle, come up.

210
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:52,809
Come up!

211
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,505
Three triangle?

212
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:03,211
Me?

213
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:05,198
Me!?

214
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:19,147
Then we'll start.

215
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:22,396
Jan Di, you can press the button.

216
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:38,153
Ji Hoo.

217
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,884
Jun Pyo.

218
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,880
Horseback riding?

219
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,302
That's what it is.

220
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,228
Who's better at that?

221
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:18,456
Ji Hoo.

222
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:20,105
That's great!

223
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,580
That means you two have a
better chance at surviving!

224
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,472
Ga Eul.

225
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,662
I've told you once and I'll tell you again.

226
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:30,233
Fates aren't that easy to predict!

227
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:34,608
Then, did you get a sign from them?

228
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,839
What did they say?

229
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:43,624
The possibility...

230
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:44,710
Possibility?

231
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,362
It's 50/50.

232
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:50,339
Ugh!

233
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:52,793
Just don't say anything if
you're going to be like that!!

234
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,241
<i>You never help, never.</i>

235
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:55,285
<i>What is this?</i>

236
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:45,863
Young Master!

237
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,239
Young Master!

238
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,032
Are you alright?

239
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,160
In Jupiter's condition, it's pushing it!

240
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,319
Why don't you use a different horse.

241
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,713
No.

242
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,296
I can't do it if it's not him.

243
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:03,714
Coach Park.

244
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:04,903
Yes, Young Master.

245
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:06,876
Tell me the truth.

246
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:10,600
Do you think I'll be able to win?

247
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,234
Nevermind, I'll make my own destiny.

248
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:32,269
Are you sure it'll be okay if
you don't try him out first?

249
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:35,622
I've been asking him to do well for
me tomorrow since it's really

250
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:36,823
an important race for me.

251
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,156
Take care of him for me.

252
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,067
Young Master.

253
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:53,481
Must... you do this?

254
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,290
If I could avoid it, I would.

255
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:00,843
I didn't train you guys to see you fight.

256
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:02,089
Sorry.

257
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:37,952
Horse!

258
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:39,830
Horse? Horse!

259
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,779
Ready!

260
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:26,438
Go!

261
00:24:53,357 --> 00:24:55,547
<i>The mountain trails would be too
much for him in his condition.</i>

262
00:24:56,142 --> 00:24:58,989
<i>If he were to go that way,
it may be fatal to him.</i>

263
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:21,150
Let's go!

264
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:24,688
Go!

265
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:48,684
What's their record?

266
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:51,895
About 49 wins to 1 loss?

267
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,532
In favor of who?

268
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:58,038
No one out of us can beat Ji Hoo.

269
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,200
What a relief.

270
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:06,425
That's...

271
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:09,411
<i>It's Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

272
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:27,722
That's a surprise.

273
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:29,115
I wonder how he won!

274
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,774
What are we going to do!

275
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:05,543
Want to pet him?

276
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:07,560
Can I?

277
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,180
His name's Rui.

278
00:27:15,603 --> 00:27:17,058
Hi Rui.

279
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,100
My name is Geum Jan Di.

280
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:24,199
Rui.

281
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:26,849
It was hard wasn't it?

282
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:28,705
You did a good job today.

283
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,958
Thank you!

284
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:43,436
What?

285
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:44,938
Really?

286
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:47,870
He said he wants to give you a ride.

287
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,069
Are you sure?

288
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:54,025
I'm pretty heavy!

289
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:46,360
He won't be able to run anymore.

290
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,248
No!

291
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:52,471
Do something.

292
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,524
Do something Coach!

293
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,199
I'm sorry, Young Master.

294
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:15,132
You may have won the game,
but you lost the battle little brother.

295
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:21,464
I hope you learned something from this.

296
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,027
Or else Jupiter's efforts would
have been for nothing.

297
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:13,455
Next, it's time to open up Ji Hoo's, right?

298
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:11,405
Mother!

299
00:31:11,525 --> 00:31:13,439
Mother!

300
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,880
Mother!

301
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:18,275
Car... car...

302
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:20,778
No!

303
00:32:55,575 --> 00:32:57,499
<i>Mother!</i>

304
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:59,580
<i>Mother!</i>

305
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:01,254
<i>Mother!</i>

306
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:04,478
Good morning!

307
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:09,412
Why are you guys here
so early in the morning?

308
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:17,066
Butler Lee.

309
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:18,782
This soup tastes great!

310
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,555
Jun Pyo, are you really going to do it?

311
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:24,731
That lot wasn't drawn by me, you know.

312
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:27,344
He drew that lot himself, what can I do?

313
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,657
This is all his luck, you know.

314
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,359
What do they call it?

315
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:33,420
Luck is a strength.

316
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,497
Yes, that's it.

317
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,594
Ji Ho...

318
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,065
That guy will not be able to do it.

319
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:41,443
There's no need for him to
insist on doing it, you know.

320
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:43,833
After all, he can just forfeit then...

321
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:45,648
How do they say it?

322
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:47,395
Win without fighting.

323
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,533
That's right, win without fighting.

324
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:52,555
If that happens, I win two times in a row.

325
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:54,949
Then, there's no need to
continue the challenge.

326
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,601
I just knew this was how it'd turn out.

327
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,591
"In Gan Ung Bo Sa Pal Gui Jung*"
(*he says it wrong)

328
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,522
What is he talking about?

329
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:10,382
In Gwa Ung Bo*
(*Causes and consequences).

330
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,729
Sa Pil Gui Jung*
(*Truth wins out in the long run)

331
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:15,263
My brother.

332
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:17,435
You're that happy?

333
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:18,156
Yes, I'm happy,

334
00:34:18,276 --> 00:34:19,158
Overjoyed.

335
00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:21,536
That's great, isn't it?

336
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:35,816
Noona!

337
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,048
Is this funny?

338
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,578
Are you laughing?

339
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:23,045
You must be mentally prepared, you know.

340
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,437
What do you mean?

341
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:26,359
Ji Ho sunbae will never win this.

342
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:30,647
That means this challenge
is going to end right here.

343
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:35,236
Geum Jan Di, you'll be expelled
just as expected.

344
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,530
Why don't you get your bags packed already?

345
00:35:38,391 --> 00:35:40,753
The result will be apparent only at the end.

346
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,991
I believe in Ji Ho sunbae.

347
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:49,450
It wasn't that long ago you were telling
Jun Pyo sunbae about believing in you.

348
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,908
You're really thick-skinned.

349
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:58,930
Are all those in poverty always
swaying with the wind?

350
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:02,878
Just the thought of Ji Ho sunbae
suffering for someone like you,

351
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:05,677
I'm so mad, it makes my hair stand on end.

352
00:36:06,484 --> 00:36:08,370
What are you saying?

353
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:19,544
I should go and stop him.

354
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:22,476
Isn't there any other way out?

355
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:23,924
Oh, yeah!

356
00:36:24,209 --> 00:36:26,553
What if you go beg that noona..?

357
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:29,957
She already helped us a great deal.

358
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:32,701
So you're just getting ready
for the expulsion?

359
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:37,044
If it makes Ji Ho sunbae suffer this much,
I should just get expelled.

360
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:39,573
Ji Ho sunbae, will he just give up?

361
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,878
What's this?

362
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,873
If you can't stop him, you should
just go and cheer him on.

363
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:51,843
Right?

364
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:53,765
Hurry up and go.

365
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:01,084
Thanks, boss.

366
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,347
- Geum Jan Di, fighting!
- Fighting!

367
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,102
Ga Eul, when is competition day?

368
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:11,323
Why are you asking?

369
00:37:13,716 --> 00:37:15,607
If I went there...

370
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:18,241
Prince Andrew will be there too, right?

371
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,557
What should I wear that day?

372
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,409
Ga Eul, how's my complexion?

373
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,828
It's gone bad, hasn't it?

374
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,477
This is not the time for
me to act like this,

375
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:27,531
I have to go in and do some upkeep now.

376
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:33,540
He's so ugly. Ugly!

377
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:35,333
Why is he like that? Really!

378
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,371
<i>Stand by me, please look at me.</i>

379
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:47,727
<i>Even though I don't know about love yet.</i>

380
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:52,154
<i>Stand by me, please focus on me.</i>

381
00:37:52,274 --> 00:37:56,520
<i>Even though I don't know how to love yet.</i>

382
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:29,101
There's something I'd like to ask you.

383
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:31,291
Go ahead.

384
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:36,581
How did you get your driving license?

385
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:39,516
You heard about it?

386
00:38:44,596 --> 00:38:46,313
Seo Hyun taught me.

387
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,448
I thought I was going to die.

388
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,592
But I didn't want to be embarrassed.

389
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,174
That's how I got the license.

390
00:39:13,904 --> 00:39:15,640
You should stop now.

391
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:17,640
Why must I stop?

392
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:22,672
There's no more value in going on.

393
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:27,762
Anyway, I didn't come to
that school voluntarily.

394
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:29,388
Stay with me.

395
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:33,798
I don't know if I can win but...

396
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:36,272
I'll try my best.

397
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:39,417
Now, I want to win.

398
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:46,056
That...

399
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,841
Is that for me to eat?

400
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:50,484
Ah!

401
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,566
Do you want to try it?

402
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:05,642
<i>Together make it love.</i>

403
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,296
<i>Forever make it your smile.</i>

404
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:12,369
<i>Happy smiles that fill you up.</i>

405
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:14,576
<i>Together make it love.</i>

406
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:16,906
<i>Forever make it your smile.</i>

407
00:40:17,157 --> 00:40:20,873
<i>Now please hold, please hold my hand.</i>

408
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:22,666
Delicious!

409
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,691
<i>{\a6}Stand by me, please look at me.</i>

410
00:40:24,747 --> 00:40:26,390
Eat more then.

411
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:29,511
<i>{\a6}Even though I don't know about love yet.</i>

412
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,819
<i>Stand by me, please focus on me.</i>

413
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:38,992
<i>Even though I don't know how to love yet.</i>

414
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,260
Oh, there!

415
00:41:21,543 --> 00:41:23,718
Do your jobs well!

416
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:26,140
What's wrong with the car?

417
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,635
Do you want to be fired?

418
00:41:27,706 --> 00:41:28,982
Do you want to be fired?

419
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:09,002
<i>Whenever I'm tired, lucky in my life.</i>

420
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:15,135
<i>Like a dream, you come to my side.</i>

421
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:20,873
<i>Whenever I'm sad, lucky in my dream.</i>

422
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:28,130
<i>You always surround me with your warmth.</i>

423
00:42:29,307 --> 00:42:35,210
<i>No matter when or where
I always smile like this.</i>

424
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:41,367
<i>No matter how much more
troubles on earth, I'd never...</i>

425
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:46,467
<i>Let you see my tears.</i>

426
00:42:46,587 --> 00:42:52,368
<i>Even if you don't know my heart.</i>

427
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:55,678
<i>Even if from afar.</i>

428
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:04,835
<i>I can see your smile, I'd feel very lucky.</i>

429
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:13,613
<i>Can you come one step closer to me?</i>

430
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,017
Yi Jung, is the preparation for
your exhibition going well?

431
00:43:20,137 --> 00:43:22,029
Yes.

432
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:23,817
When is it supposed to be?

433
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,706
I think, probably next month.

434
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:37,434
Over here!

435
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:43,893
The weather is great, right?

436
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:45,930
Come sit over here.

437
00:43:56,095 --> 00:43:56,991
What would you like to drink?

438
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:59,864
We have an in-house formulated cocoa,
want to try that?

439
00:44:00,312 --> 00:44:00,824
Yes.

440
00:44:00,944 --> 00:44:01,935
Your friend too?

441
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:02,704
Yes.

442
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:05,206
Don't say no, it's a great drink, you know.

443
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:06,374
Butler Lee,

444
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:08,517
<i>Please bring us some cocoa.</i>

445
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:11,458
<i>Here you go.</i>

446
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,705
- Eat.
- Yes.

447
00:44:20,217 --> 00:44:21,371
Hey, buddy.

448
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:26,912
I'm asking you a favor.

449
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:29,462
It's not too late to change your mind now.

450
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,661
Be careful.

451
00:44:42,587 --> 00:44:44,543
Don't force yourself, just stop now.

452
00:44:44,903 --> 00:44:46,306
Are you worried for me?

453
00:44:47,156 --> 00:44:49,999
Please, be careful.

454
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,742
Hey, you know if you lose this round,

455
00:45:01,862 --> 00:45:03,866
It'll all end.

456
00:45:03,986 --> 00:45:05,268
Any strategy...

457
00:45:05,481 --> 00:45:06,826
No,

458
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,262
A secret weapon or something,
do you have that?

459
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,299
You do, right?

460
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,227
You must.

461
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:18,401
Secret weapon?

462
00:45:27,062 --> 00:45:28,184
I have it.

463
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:46,662
Stay still.

464
00:45:51,731 --> 00:45:54,036
It may be a little childish
but this is our strategy.

465
00:45:54,156 --> 00:45:56,362
Just cooperate with me.

466
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:29,092
<i>Jun Pyo, I'm sorry.</i>

467
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:33,036
<i>Even if I have to do this,
I must watch over her.</i>

468
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:36,333
Yoon Ji Ho...

469
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:39,071
You must be completely mad.

470
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:42,311
Not just once but twice,

471
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:45,925
No, including this one, it's three times!

472
00:46:48,268 --> 00:46:50,286
You must die today.

473
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,075
Hey!

474
00:49:10,419 --> 00:49:11,453
Jan Di!

475
00:49:11,704 --> 00:49:12,814
Look at that.

476
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:14,207
Hey!

477
00:49:17,226 --> 00:49:18,056
<i>Really!</i>

478
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:01,041
These kids,

479
00:50:01,161 --> 00:50:03,541
when did they become so adorable?

480
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:06,380
Exactly so.

481
00:50:08,203 --> 00:50:10,540
Ah, it was a good decision
to return to Korea.

482
00:50:10,725 --> 00:50:13,032
Much better than going to
Hollywood, you know?

483
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:16,299
Yes, an old man like me has more to do now!

484
00:50:21,576 --> 00:50:23,889
Die, die! You die!

485
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:30,412
Sometimes, a monkey can
fall off a branch too.

486
00:50:30,788 --> 00:50:32,635
Who said cornering was his strength now?

487
00:50:32,755 --> 00:50:34,752
Blowing his own horn.

488
00:50:34,872 --> 00:50:36,155
In the end, Ji Hoo...

489
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:37,939
Managed to hold the steering wheel.

490
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:39,410
Yes.

491
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:40,871
If it wasn't for Geum Jan Di,

492
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:42,361
He would never do it.

493
00:50:43,003 --> 00:50:43,986
Did you see it?

494
00:50:44,299 --> 00:50:46,537
How did they move along so quickly?

495
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,711
They're quite affectionate too.

496
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:50,185
Go die!

497
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,199
What's this?

498
00:50:58,731 --> 00:50:59,920
It's not working

499
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:02,486
Hey, it broke down.

500
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,740
See how he's pressing it,
of course it'll break down.

501
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,314
This is the final determining round.

502
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:16,417
Shall we see Jan Di's lot?

503
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:36,866
[Swimming]

504
00:51:41,904 --> 00:51:42,892
Ridiculous!

505
00:51:43,012 --> 00:51:44,472
What's this? Invalid!

506
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:47,505
Hey, Geum Jan Di,

507
00:51:47,787 --> 00:51:49,054
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

508
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:50,129
Say it.

509
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,210
This is all a setup, right?

510
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:53,902
I won't do it.

511
00:51:54,246 --> 00:51:55,232
I won't.

512
00:51:56,468 --> 00:51:57,594
<i>Up to you.</i>

513
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,786
I'll take it as you forfeited the challenge,

514
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:02,733
So Ji Hoo wins this round, any objections?

515
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,001
What do you mean by that?

516
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,277
I told you.

517
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:07,470
Whatever the outcome may be,
you must respect it.

518
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,613
I was afraid something like this may happen.

519
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:10,828
<i>I...</i>

520
00:52:11,805 --> 00:52:13,708
Well, although it was initially agreed upon,

521
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:16,105
But to end it like this,
to Jun Pyo or to the rest of us,

522
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:17,407
It's not fair.

523
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:20,266
And so?

524
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:23,567
If you'd agree to it, I nominate
myself to take his place.

525
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:24,740
What?

526
00:52:25,397 --> 00:52:26,900
<i>For this matter,</i>

527
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:30,150
I'm unwilling to let him off so easily too.

528
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:36,876
This does sound rather reasonable.

529
00:52:37,204 --> 00:52:40,365
Then, if everyone agrees, I'm okay too.

530
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:41,742
What do you think?

531
00:52:41,862 --> 00:52:42,889
I agree.

532
00:52:43,556 --> 00:52:44,684
I unconditionally agree.

533
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,609
I agree too.

534
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,517
<i>I'm against it.</i>

535
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:50,207
What?

536
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,094
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

537
00:52:52,345 --> 00:52:53,847
This fella, even at the end...

538
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,946
I want to take part too.

539
00:52:58,683 --> 00:53:01,454
In place of Gu Jun Pyo,
Yi Jung sunbae is taking part.

540
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,725
So for this round, I'd take
part in place of Ji Hoo sunbae.

541
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:07,965
Your competitor is Yi Jung, you know.

542
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:09,999
He's a guy and he's a strong guy too.

543
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,654
This matter involves me too. I can't
just be watching from the sideline.

544
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,672
Stop sticking your head into
this matter, will you?

545
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,646
How can a girl join in this competition?

546
00:53:18,912 --> 00:53:21,165
This involves whether I'd be
expelled from school or not,

547
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:23,618
I want to put in my best effort too,

548
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,834
then I won't feel so grieved.

549
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:33,433
Then, let's make it two-against-two.

550
00:53:34,074 --> 00:53:35,608
Who? Me?

551
00:53:35,952 --> 00:53:37,090
I agree too.

552
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,374
Jan Di, if that's what you want,
let's do it.

553
00:53:45,616 --> 00:53:47,835
So it's a done deal just because
you two want it that way?

554
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,704
Gu Jun Pyo, we won't let up
just because she's a girl.

555
00:53:52,377 --> 00:53:54,395
It's my duty to target Ji Hoo.

556
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:07,426
Fine, until the end of the competition,

557
00:54:07,546 --> 00:54:09,617
there's still about 70 hours.

558
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:13,356
<i>Almost paradise.</i>

559
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:17,439
<i>More glorious than dawn.</i>

560
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,803
<i>Your love for me.</i>

561
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:24,221
<i>Feels like I own the whole world.</i>

562
00:54:24,443 --> 00:54:26,817
<i>In my life.</i>

563
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:30,554
<i>Like a dream in my tired life.</i>

564
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:40,091
<i>I hope I can treasure your love forever.</i>

565
00:54:41,502 --> 00:54:48,726
<i>{\a6}I hold your hand
and shout to the world.</i>

566
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,194
Hey, that's not your fastest speed!

567
00:54:47,314 --> 00:54:49,650
I won't swim anymore.

568
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,238
<i>{\a6}I swear to heaven.</i>

569
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:51,279
Hey, you fool,

570
00:54:51,379 --> 00:54:52,813
Even I swim faster than you!

571
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:55,838
<i>{\a6}I will love only you.</i>

572
00:54:56,474 --> 00:54:58,147
<i>Like the stars in the night.</i>

573
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:03,417
<i>A beautiful dream paradise
that belongs to us alone.</i>

574
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:10,724
<i>I can go anywhere, to my paradise.</i>

575
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:13,535
<i>Days without you.</i>

576
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:17,569
<i>I'll forget all the pain.</i>

577
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:24,265
<i>{\a6}This is only the start, being with you.</i>

578
00:55:18,382 --> 00:55:20,338
Ah! I'm so tired.

579
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:23,086
Ah! Ten more minutes, just ten minutes!

580
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:28,660
<i>Start to travel, start to run.</i>

581
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:31,734
<i>Loving you forever.</i>

582
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,223
<i>Almost paradise.</i>

583
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:39,001
<i>{\a6}Warmer than the sun.</i>

584
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:40,401
<i>Long ago, there was a poor
little girl named Geum Jan Di...</i>

585
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:50,224
Why must you be so headstrong
and say those things?

586
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:52,969
I don't know,

587
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:54,740
Why did I do that?

588
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,124
Don't you know?

589
00:55:56,244 --> 00:55:58,304
You have an incurable disease.

590
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,255
Defending the weak against the strong.

591
00:56:00,585 --> 00:56:03,275
It's all my fault that Sunbae
is being ostracized.

592
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:05,281
So if you lose, it'll be alright?

593
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:06,955
That's why I must win.

594
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,472
Are you confident of winning?

595
00:56:09,038 --> 00:56:10,196
Really!

596
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:13,098
How will it turn out?

597
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,927
If only I had a time machine
to see the outcome right now.

598
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,526
<i>Jan Di, faster, faster...</i>

599
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:20,733
Even faster, faster!

600
00:56:20,853 --> 00:56:23,118
3... 2... 1!

601
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:25,569
What is it?

602
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:26,583
What's your dream?

603
00:56:26,703 --> 00:56:27,850
Was it about Jan Di?

604
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,117
A dream about the challenge!

605
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:30,081
Who won?

606
00:56:30,356 --> 00:56:31,463
Well...

607
00:56:32,496 --> 00:56:35,766
Up until just before the end,
it was just about...

608
00:56:36,212 --> 00:56:36,781
Just about?

609
00:56:36,981 --> 00:56:40,526
Then just when you reached your
hand out, at that moment...

610
00:56:40,977 --> 00:56:43,000
That moment?

611
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,061
It became all dark.

612
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:46,532
What?

613
00:56:46,876 --> 00:56:47,861
All dark.

614
00:56:48,206 --> 00:56:49,160
Nothing.

615
00:56:49,523 --> 00:56:50,341
Then I woke up.

616
00:56:50,722 --> 00:56:51,833
What's that?

617
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:52,881
Just a daydream.

618
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:54,273
Oh, really!

619
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,291
You're not of much help at all.

620
00:56:57,934 --> 00:56:59,179
This won't do.

621
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:01,432
That Yi Jung or Three* Jung,
(*Yi sounds like Two)

622
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:03,920
No matter what ploy I must use on him...

623
00:57:04,499 --> 00:57:05,460
What ploy?

624
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,939
Put some laxative into his
porridge or something.

625
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:11,368
No!

626
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,460
Ga Eul,

627
00:57:12,774 --> 00:57:13,673
How could you think of that?

628
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:15,300
Ahjusshi, you're the one!

629
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,619
You have four eyes but you
still can't tell who's the enemy.

630
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,084
That's not it.

631
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:23,604
How can you use the sacred porridge
in such a devious ploy?

632
00:57:23,724 --> 00:57:25,217
No, no, never.

633
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:26,403
Understand?

634
00:57:26,721 --> 00:57:28,035
All along, porridge brings...

635
00:57:28,254 --> 00:57:29,606
health to those who are sick,

636
00:57:29,798 --> 00:57:31,709
consolation to those who are weary.

637
00:57:31,879 --> 00:57:34,903
Such sacred food,
how many times must I say it?

638
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,085
He exploded again, really.

639
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,490
I know, I know.

640
00:57:42,227 --> 00:57:45,890
Then, I'll just use a bicycle and
crash into him from the back.

641
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:46,812
Ga Eul!

642
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:48,304
See!

643
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,040
I told you he likes him!

644
00:58:20,536 --> 00:58:21,647
So?

645
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:24,228
You're asking me to lose to her on purpose?

646
00:58:24,978 --> 00:58:27,595
Since it doesn't matter whether you win
or lose, it's nothing to you anyway.

647
00:58:27,715 --> 00:58:28,493
But Jan Di...

648
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:29,822
She'll be expelled.

649
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:33,581
A guy challenging a girl and having
to settle who wins or loses,

650
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:35,153
Don't you think it's embarrassing?

651
00:58:35,273 --> 00:58:37,971
If a guy challenges a girl and loses to her,

652
00:58:38,091 --> 00:58:40,219
that is really embarrassing!

653
00:58:40,907 --> 00:58:41,785
So...

654
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:44,820
So you're going to win no matter what?

655
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,753
Although I don't intend to die trying,

656
00:58:47,873 --> 00:58:49,584
I won't settle for just muddling through it.

657
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:50,514
Hey you!

658
00:58:50,634 --> 00:58:51,651
Listen,

659
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,855
I don't think you have the
right to yell at me, you know.

660
00:58:54,975 --> 00:58:56,248
What did you say?

661
00:58:56,368 --> 00:58:59,912
I warned you, I yield to soft approaches
rather than hard ones.

662
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:03,848
I went to your rice shop and chatted
with you amicably, you know.

663
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:06,812
It's not a rice shop but a porridge shop.

664
00:59:07,657 --> 00:59:09,675
Birds of a feather flock together,

665
00:59:09,795 --> 00:59:11,224
that saying is so true.

666
00:59:11,874 --> 00:59:13,021
What do you mean?

667
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:14,862
Geum Jan Di's habit of defending the weak,

668
00:59:15,269 --> 00:59:16,086
Is that contagious?

669
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:17,275
Hey, you rude fella!

670
00:59:17,395 --> 00:59:19,066
The exit's that way.

671
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:31,812
So cold.

672
00:59:32,746 --> 00:59:34,090
I'm back!

673
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,919
Get over here.

674
00:59:36,474 --> 00:59:37,305
Hurry.

675
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:38,619
What is it?

676
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:40,501
What do you mean 'What is it'?

677
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:42,313
Is something wrong?

678
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:44,494
That's what we wanted to ask you.

679
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:48,214
Hey, what's this about a challenge?
And what's this about an expulsion?

680
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:50,421
Oh.. that...

681
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,233
Shut up!

682
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:53,981
Just answer my question with
a 'Yes' or 'No'.

683
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:56,753
Mom, that is...

684
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:58,052
You're going out with that
hyung named Yoon Ji Hoo,

685
00:59:58,172 --> 01:00:00,187
And you're acting dubious so
Gu Jun Pyo hates you now,

686
01:00:00,307 --> 01:00:02,034
so you're being expelled, is that the truth?

687
01:00:02,154 --> 01:00:03,043
Well...

688
01:00:03,163 --> 01:00:04,227
'Yes' or 'No'?

689
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:05,195
Yes!

690
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:07,182
What will we do?

691
01:00:07,635 --> 01:00:08,793
Oh! Dear heavens!

692
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:12,077
Hey, don't you know how difficult
it was to get into that school?

693
01:00:12,282 --> 01:00:16,070
School? I can just go back
to the previous one.

694
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:19,140
Pre... pre... previous school?
Previous school!

695
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:21,440
In your previous school,
is master Jun Pyo there?

696
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,758
Tell me! Tell me!

697
01:00:22,878 --> 01:00:24,791
Honey, calm down.

698
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:27,448
Right from the start, I knew for us,
this would be an impossible fate.

699
01:00:27,568 --> 01:00:29,868
But for us, we still have the
laundry shop, don't we?

700
01:00:29,988 --> 01:00:30,950
So long as we continue like now...

701
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,136
Dad!

702
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,920
If Noona gets expelled, those uniforms
won't come to us anymore.

703
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,102
Everyone will think it's unlucky,
we'll even lose our regular customers.

704
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:39,257
This mustn't happen to us now.

705
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:40,978
Let's go and apologize right away.

706
01:00:41,098 --> 01:00:41,979
Honey, straighten your hair.

707
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:43,841
Kang San, prepare the cushions*.
(*for kneeling)

708
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,262
Noona,

709
01:00:45,669 --> 01:00:48,610
Why is it I don't remember
teaching you any of this?

710
01:00:48,907 --> 01:00:50,485
I'm so disappointed.

711
01:00:53,051 --> 01:00:54,106
Dad!

712
01:00:54,226 --> 01:00:55,228
You!

713
01:00:55,478 --> 01:00:58,393
If you get expelled, from that day on,
your fate with us will end.

714
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:01,674
No matter how I think about it,
it must be all your fault.

715
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:06,220
What kind of fool are you!
How dare you cheat on the guy!

716
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:09,348
Honey, you have no right to scold her.

717
01:01:09,468 --> 01:01:10,546
She must have learnt it all from you.

718
01:01:10,608 --> 01:01:12,072
Hey, you!

719
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:13,168
What?

720
01:01:13,887 --> 01:01:14,920
Mom, you...

721
01:01:15,174 --> 01:01:17,107
Hey, watch what you say!

722
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:19,943
Jan Di...

723
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:22,389
I've been through it so I know,

724
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:24,991
To be cheated on,
that feels really terrible.

725
01:01:25,111 --> 01:01:26,064
<i>Even so,</i>

726
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:28,666
if the girl takes it on
herself to apologize,

727
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:29,796
Then,

728
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,729
he'll feel helpless but he'll still
forgive you, that's how guys are.

729
01:01:32,749 --> 01:01:33,691
So...

730
01:01:34,645 --> 01:01:35,455
So?

731
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:37,606
Say sorry!

732
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:39,268
<i>Say sorry!</i>

733
01:01:39,388 --> 01:01:40,949
Say sorry!

734
01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:42,400
<i>Say sorry!</i>

735
01:01:42,649 --> 01:01:44,097
Say sorry!

736
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:45,857
Say sorry!

737
01:01:46,121 --> 01:01:47,649
Say sorry!

738
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:15,496
Gu Jun Pyo?

739
01:02:26,716 --> 01:02:28,281
Where are you going so late at night?

740
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:30,928
To practice, why?

741
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:32,871
You want to win that much?

742
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:36,101
We have no choice.

743
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,034
'We'?

744
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:45,494
Why must it be Ji Ho?

745
01:02:48,842 --> 01:02:50,499
So long as it's not Ji Ho...

746
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,127
Gu Jun Pyo!

747
01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:02,267
It's still not too late now.

748
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,393
Just say this one sentence.

749
01:03:09,303 --> 01:03:10,761
Say you like me...

750
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:14,500
Just that.

Geum Jan Di!

758
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:42,996
Shall we... go on a date?

759
01:03:43,825 --> 01:03:44,670
Date?

760
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,050
<i>Ji Hoo and Geum Jan Di,</i>

761
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,401
<i>It's hard to imagine them.</i>

762
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:50,832
<i>They must be somewhere sunning
themselves or taking a nap.</i>

763
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,451
I'll get the wind and a good workout too.

764
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:57,710
Wearing just that?

765
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,635
<i>You know, love...</i>

766
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:04,576
<i>Does not always happen as you planned it.</i>

767
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:06,586
<i>Where is this?</i>

768
01:04:06,706 --> 01:04:07,711
My house.

769
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,032
What?

770
01:04:09,152 --> 01:04:11,770
I always thought that I
owe something to Ji Hoo.

771
01:04:12,203 --> 01:04:13,128
<i>Geum Jan Di,</i>

772
01:04:13,346 --> 01:04:15,499
<i>I can't do what I did in the past,
just so that no one else can have her.</i>

773
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:17,201
<i>I'll go and destroy her myself.</i>

774
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:21,195
What?

775
01:04:22,747 --> 01:04:23,888
What did you say?
