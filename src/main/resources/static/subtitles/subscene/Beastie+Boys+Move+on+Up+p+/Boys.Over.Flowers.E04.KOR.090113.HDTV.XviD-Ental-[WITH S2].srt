3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,720
What are you doing?

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,800
Who are you to do this kind of thing?

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,950
Did anyone ask for that kind of favor?

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,810
That isn't even a favor. It's groveling.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,340
Don't you have any pride?

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,740
It's not because I don't have any pride.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,380
It's because you were hurting so much.

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,210
Because you were about to die from sadness.

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,420
What does it matter to you?

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,780
It has nothing to do with you.

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,560
Get lost.

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 4

15
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,690
The energy around you is so dark.

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,870
What use is it even if
the F4 emits our own light?

17
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,590
There really is no black hole other than you.

18
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,990
Gu Jun Pyo,

19
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,940
can I ask you something?

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Are you not going to ask me
if I tell you not to ask?

21
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,650
Just act like you usually do.
It doesn't suit you.

22
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,200
Would suppressing your emotions
and not expressing them,

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,790
for the sake of the person you like,
be the right thing to do?

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,210
Right thing, my foot!

25
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,010
- Huh?
- What is that?

26
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,150
Then that's being a complete stranger.
How is that liking someone?

27
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,460
If the world goes into pieces tomorrow,

28
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,310
then you'd probably die
first because of regret.

29
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,400
Gu Jun Pyo,

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,460
What?

31
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:46,240
you might not be completely stupid.

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,300
Did you know that just now?

33
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,970
It's better to regret your actions, instead
of regretting because you didn't do anything.

34
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,190
That's my philosophy.

35
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,430
It looks like Ji Hoo isn't going
to show up till the very end.

36
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,300
Be well everyone.

37
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,720
And don't cause any trouble.

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,100
Goodbye. We'll visit.

39
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,150
Don't come visit.
Come to have an exhibition.

40
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,130
Take care of yourself.

41
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,740
Being too kind is your disease.

42
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,780
If you treat someone too well,
the scars run deeper, Casanova.

43
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,710
Must you do that lawyer or NGO crap, Noona?

44
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,540
I really can't understand women.

45
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,360
Do you know it's been ten years since
you've sincerely called me Noona?

46
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,360
Anyway, it's the truth
that it's pretty cool,

47
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,360
so I decided to accept you as a Noona.

48
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,680
Are you complaining?

49
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,350
Jan Di.

50
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,390
Please don't forget my favor.

51
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,850
Please take care of yourself.

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,930
Be well everyone. I'm going.

53
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,740
Go, take care of yourself.

54
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,440
<i>Ruthless bastard.</i>

55
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,340
<i>How can he not come to the very end?</i>

56
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,710
What did I tell you?

57
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,300
You guys tell me that I have
the cruelest personality,

58
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,460
but I told you that the
real cruel one is Ji Hoo.

59
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,260
He looks so serene, but once he
turns his back, he's the scariest.

60
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,040
<i>Isn't the talking behind
my back a little too harsh?</i>

61
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,100
- You...
- What is this?

62
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,450
- How long have you been here?
- Since three hours ago.

63
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,190
<i>What? So you were here before us...</i>

64
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,740
and you didn't even come out for a peek?

65
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,460
What are you doing right now?

66
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,450
Were you someone who is only this good?

67
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,770
Chase after her!

68
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,020
If she can't stay next to you,

69
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,210
then you can go next to her.

70
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,550
You said that you liked her.

71
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,260
Does your love only consist of
looking out from behind a pillar?

72
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,450
Do you still have the right
to say that you love her?

73
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,970
It's for the next plane.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,240
I already sent along my luggage.

75
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,370
Yoon Ji Hoo.

76
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,710
Rascal, he has a skill
for surprising people.

77
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,850
How did you suddenly
get the heart to do that?

78
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,390
Thanks to this little lady.

79
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,200
What?

80
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,590
What? Rascal.

81
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,740
Come here, come here.

82
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,150
<i>Cute rascal!</i>

83
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,470
Thanks.

84
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,560
I came to realize it thanks to you.

85
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,580
That I have to earnestly spend time with her.

86
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,990
You taught me to possibly have
the courage to hang on to her.

87
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,300
It's a relief that I got
to know a child like you.

88
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,570
I'm going.

89
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,230
Geum Jan Di.

90
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,790
What? What are you going to do now?

91
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,220
Listen to my words very carefully.

92
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,910
I'm only going to say this once,
so listen very carefully.

93
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,720
Geum Jan Di. You and I...

94
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,780
What did he say?

95
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,780
Aren't you getting in?

96
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,450
Saturday at 4 o'clock.
In front of Nam San Tower.

97
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,900
If you're late one minute, you're dead.

98
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,860
We must get it at all costs.

99
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,160
Come quickly!

100
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,610
As soon as it opens at
4 o'clock, run for this.

101
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,180
And if you find something that you
think will fit, just stuff it in the cart.

102
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,560
Wouldn't it be better
if we just went together?

103
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,740
Mom needs to go to the cabbage blowout sale.

104
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,310
If the clothes shop was the civil war,
this cabbage shop is

105
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,390
World War II.

106
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,090
Right.

107
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,340
You know, the lady who was standing next
to me last time. Her teeth were out too.

108
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,050
Really?

109
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,200
Three months worth of our shop's
profits are in our hands.

110
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,650
Got it?

111
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,150
Aja!

112
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,490
It's snowing.

113
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,220
Hey, Dad must be waiting for us.
Let's go home quickly.

114
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,120
Saturday at 4 o'clock.
In front of Nam San Tower.

115
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,470
No way... no, no.

116
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,840
That can't be.

117
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,130
What are you murmuring about?

118
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,090
Mom, there's no way someone
would wait outside in the snow,

119
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,330
for four hours, when I didn't
say that I'd go, right?

120
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,590
How can someone do that
unless they're crazy?

121
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,870
Let's go.

122
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,330
Hold on.

123
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,060
Crazy guy...

124
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,060
Mom, hold this.

125
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,540
Mom, go on ahead.

126
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,410
Jan Di! Where are you going?

127
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,050
I'm going somewhere!

128
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,340
That girl!

129
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,760
Do you know what time it is?

130
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,940
That's what I'm supposed to ask.

131
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,410
Do you know what time it is?
Do you really have nothing else to do?

132
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,820
Didn't I say that you'd be
dead if you were late?

133
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,330
Did I say that I'd come?

134
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,060
You're here now.

135
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,000
That's because...

136
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,520
I was thinking that maybe there'd
be a chance that you'd be waiting.

137
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,160
So what would have happened
if I didn't come by?

138
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,510
But anyways, you came!

139
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,950
And whose fault is it that
I went through all this?

140
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,750
What have you done so well
that you're getting all huffy?

141
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,120
It's cold.

142
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,110
Get up.

143
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,170
I'll buy you something warm.

144
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,850
Steam's coming off from your body.

145
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,740
Get up.

146
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,660
Quickly.

147
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,300
You wanna drink tea?
Or do you wanna just go?

148
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,530
Here.

149
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,860
It's 30,000 Won coffee.

150
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,260
Thug, are you scamming people now too?

151
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,410
And I can't drink this kind of crap.

152
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,790
Just try it.

153
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,360
The coffee tastes excellent.

154
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,090
Do you want me to tell you
why it's 30,000 Won coffee?

155
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,210
Follow me.

156
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,080
Wow.

157
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,320
How is it?

158
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,170
Wasn't I right?

159
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,120
It's just like drinking coffee
from a hotel's sky lounge.

160
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,820
Would someone even be
able to leave a drugstore

161
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:36,121
in your hands with
your poor calculations?

162
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,170
What?

163
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,200
36,300 Won.

164
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,270
Huh?

165
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,330
If you're going to take money, you might as
well count in the labor and extra fees.

166
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,510
So a wealthy person CAN do
those kinds of calculations...

167
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,660
I'm just acting like I don't.

168
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,540
If I really didn't know, then how
could I become a wealthy person?

169
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,620
Wow... there are so many stars.

170
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,040
Hey, those aren't stars.
They're satellites, you stupid girl.

171
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,920
Are you an idiot?

172
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,790
Are there THAT many satellites?

173
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,900
Are you kidding me? They're satellites.

174
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,760
I don't want to hear that from you.

175
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
- What, you idiot?
- What, are you dumb?

176
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,200
- This clueless girl.
- You're even more clueless.

177
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,800
Hello?

178
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,260
You're at Pork restaurant?

179
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,440
Don't budge. I'll be there.

180
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,280
- Why is it like this?
- What is it?

181
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,150
Why is it dark?

182
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,340
Ahjussi!

183
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,940
Ahjussi! There's someone here!

184
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,790
Hey, hey, hey.

185
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,130
What is it?

186
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,130
- The door's locked!
- Really? It's really locked?

187
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,930
Ahjussi!

188
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,210
Stop acting so tacky by being so panicked.

189
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,680
I can call someone, so just keep still.

190
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,140
I really need to go!
I'll be killed by my mom!

191
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,460
Where's my cell phone?

192
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,680
You don't have a phone?

193
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,520
What about you?

194
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,660
I don't have a phone to begin with.

195
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,540
What kind of girl doesn't
even have a cell phone?

196
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,040
We're locked inside because of you.

197
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,170
How is that because of me?

198
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,260
If it was cold, you should've
gone into some place warm.

199
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,870
Are you a statue or something?

200
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,940
I was pissed off.

201
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,140
It was the first time in my life that
I waited for someone like that.

202
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,780
What?

203
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,270
What are we going to do?

204
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,050
Ahjussi!

205
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,950
What are you doing?

206
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,460
Should we go in there?

207
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,760
It's cold.

208
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,370
Hey, move over.

209
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,730
I don't want to.

210
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,580
Sorry.

211
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,350
What?

212
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
I'm saying I'm sorry.

213
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,500
In the end, it's become like
this because of me.

214
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,100
At least you know your place.

215
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,870
So what?

216
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,190
Why is a plutocrat like that?

217
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,050
You were standing outside
in the cold for four hours.

218
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,310
Nobody at your house said anything?

219
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,310
Your advisor, your bodyguards,
your chauffeur...

220
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,390
What did all those people do?

221
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,390
- I sent them all away.
- Why?

222
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,250
I wanted to match the level of a commoner.

223
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,470
You really are trying way too hard.

224
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,750
Hey, grass patch.

225
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,400
What?!

226
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,410
Can I be honest with you?

227
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,150
Honest about what?

228
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,300
What is this?

229
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,120
Hey...

230
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,660
Tell me from over there.

231
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,600
Right now, I think I might be...

232
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,350
This guy... He does this every chance he gets.

233
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,200
Pervert.

234
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,570
Do you really want to be this way
in this kind of situation?

235
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,780
Get off of me.

236
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,030
Hey, get up.

237
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:59,400
If you don't get up in three seconds,
I don't know what I'll do to you.

238
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,040
One.

239
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,150
Two.

240
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,540
Two and one eighth.

241
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,010
Two.

242
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,290
Three!

243
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,000
Three!

244
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,030
Three!

245
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,230
This rascal, really...

246
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,680
Hey.

247
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,750
Why is he burning up?

248
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,580
Hey. Are you okay?

249
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm sick.

250
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,380
Sick?

251
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,540
Yeah, you're really burning up.

252
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,000
It'd be strange for you not to be sick.

253
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,600
It's cold.

254
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,260
You're cold?

255
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,680
What are you doing?

256
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,910
My mom told me that if you wrap
your head like this, you'll get warm.

257
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,230
Get in, I'll take you home.

258
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,130
It's fine.

259
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,130
I need to think of excuses for my mom.

260
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,670
I'll walk and then ride the bus.

261
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,740
Should I teach you?
Your excuses?

262
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,610
Hey!

263
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,980
I'm sorry!
I won't ever do it again!

264
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,760
Mother, Father,

265
00:25:39,761 --> 00:25:43,300
- I've committed a deadly sin.
- One, two, three!

266
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,720
Deadly sin?

267
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,240
What kind of person have you saved?

268
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,420
A person who's going to
inherit the Shinhwa Group.

269
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,940
And what kind of group is Shinhwa?

270
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,680
Korea's greatest company.

271
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,480
Then saving the inheritor of Shinhwa Group

272
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:02,181
is the same as saving Korea's economy.

273
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,930
How is that a deadly sin?

274
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,890
It won't be enough even
if we give you an order.

275
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,880
So instead of order, we got this!

276
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,770
Doesn't this suit me well?

277
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,610
What is all this?
And how did you know?

278
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,560
What do you mean, how did I know?

279
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,800
Young Master.

280
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,150
Hold on. What was Young Master's name?

281
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,760
Jun Pyo. Gu Jun Pyo.

282
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,990
- Gu Jun Pyo
- I know, I know.

283
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,990
Young Master Jun Pyo sent us all this.

284
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,760
He told me to not scold you too much
because you were with him all night.

285
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,100
He sent us all this as a repayment of his debt.

286
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,410
Because he's the Young Master
of the best plutocrat,

287
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,530
he was so well-mannered.

288
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,900
He said that next time, he would
come himself to say hello.

289
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,620
But it was so motivational,
that tears just...

290
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,420
Mom, don't cry.

291
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,090
Honey, how can you
cry on such a happy day?

292
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,400
Since I was with you for one whole night,

293
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,590
tell them that I'll take
responsibility for you.

294
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,300
<i>Hey! They say that Geum Jan Di
and Gu Jun Pyo are going out!</i>

295
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,960
<i>They say Geum Jan Di's boyfriend
is Senior Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

296
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,830
<i>Geum Jan Di has been enthroned
as Gu Jun Pyo's girlfriend.</i>

297
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,790
<i>Commoner Jan Di has ascended in identity.
Enthroned as Gu Jun Pyo's girlfriend.</i>

298
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,840
<i>They say Geum Jan Di has been enthroned
as Gu Jun Pyo's new girlfriend!</i>

299
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,430
Jan Di! Hi!

300
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,710
You look pretty today.

301
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,090
Geum Jan Di. Hi!

302
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,050
Jan Di. Hi!

303
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,310
Glad to see you!

304
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,280
Jan Di!

305
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,340
Good morning!

306
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,490
Good morning.

307
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,880
Jan Di!

308
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,670
Jan Di, do you want to go
shopping with us today?

309
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,560
Geum Jan Di, you have to come to my
birthday party this weekend.

310
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,370
Here, drink this.

311
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,340
Thanks. Thanks.

312
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:31,170
Bye! Bye!

313
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,970
Geum Jan Di.

314
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,340
She has...

315
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,990
Bad intentions.

316
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,320
Jun Pyo, is this for real?

317
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,810
No! It's not!

318
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,390
It certainly isn't what
you guys are thinking of.

319
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,500
- This, you see...
- Yeah.

320
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,020
It's real.

321
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,720
No!

322
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,400
No! No!

323
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:27,360
<i>I wandered today to the hill, Maggie.
To watch the scene below.</i>

324
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:27,361
{\a6}(Gum Jan Di means green grass)

325
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:36,360
<i>{\a6}The creek and the creaking old mill,
Maggie. Where we sat long, long ago.</i>

326
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,980
Are you okay?

327
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,640
Yeah, I was a little dizzy.

328
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,580
I'm fine now.

329
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,800
That's a relief.

330
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,660
Nobody knows that I came to visit you,
so you don't have to worry.

331
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,720
Jan Di.

332
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,220
Yes?

333
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:59,660
Is it true about F4's Gu Jun Pyo?

334
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,830
No.

335
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,660
It's because we bumped into each other
accidentally. It's simply an accident.

336
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,450
But it seemed like he really liked you.

337
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,960
Hey! That doesn't make any sense.

338
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,170
He's just playing around and teasing me.

339
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,570
How could Gu Jun Pyo...

340
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,880
Don't you know after you
got abused by him before?

341
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,550
The invincible Gu Jun Pyo liking ME?

342
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,740
That... that is true.

343
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,520
Yeah.

344
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,960
Are you going somewhere?

345
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,980
Yes, I think I'm all better now.

346
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,750
Jan Di, should we go somewhere and play?

347
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,880
Just wait a little bit.

348
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,120
Shinhwa Kindergarten?

349
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,810
NO!

350
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,610
Why are you touching other people's stuff?
What do you think you're doing?

351
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,310
Sorry...

352
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,550
I...

353
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,300
I wrote weird things in here so
I don't want anyone to see it.

354
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,310
Sorry I got mad.

355
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,430
Sorry I didn't ask for permission.

356
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:25,790
You should change your clothes too.

357
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,250
Jun Pyo,

358
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,880
are you being sincere?

359
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,000
About what?

360
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,500
Geum Jan Di.

361
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,150
What else is there besides sincerity?

362
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:41,470
Do you even know what sincerity is to us,
to take it so lightly?

363
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,950
We only have freedom in dating.

364
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,810
The final decision is made by our parents.

365
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,780
You haven't forgotten that right?

366
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,110
Were you guys just talking
like you were real men?

367
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,680
What the heck?

368
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,810
So you've been boasting when
you weren't even real men?

369
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,410
What's your definition of a real man?

370
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,260
A man who takes responsibility
from the beginning to the end.

371
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,510
To the end?

372
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,200
Yes, to the end.

373
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,660
Do you want to dance?

374
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,860
Huh?

375
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,300
Do you want to dance?

376
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:33,010
It's my first time at a place like this,
so I'm just going to watch.

377
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,080
Okay.

378
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,510
Then just wait here for a second.

379
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,090
Ow!

380
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm sorry.

381
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,400
What?

382
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,400
Are you mortified?

383
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,760
If your face is ugly, then you
should at least dance well.

384
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,040
With a sad body like that, what makes you
think it's okay for you to crawl in here?

385
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,220
Acting ugly as you look...

386
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,970
Ga Eul, you're not going anywhere right?

387
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,130
Where would I go?

388
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,210
Don't go! Don't go without me!

389
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,800
What star is this nonsense from now?

390
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,890
Just go inside and make porridge.

391
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,710
Welcome...

392
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,760
Doesn't Geum Jan Di work here?

393
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,540
Yes.

394
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't see her.

395
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,270
She's not working today.

396
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,240
And you are... Jan Di's friend?

397
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,410
Since when?

398
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,450
Since kindergarten.

399
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,740
Then you're best friends?

400
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,150
Let's go.

401
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,160
Huh?

402
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,110
Where?

403
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,950
See? I was right.

404
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm telling you because I'm
afraid Jan Di will get hurt.

405
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,660
So Dear, I would like you to warn her.

406
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,110
Those sorts of things are important for girls.

407
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,410
What sort of warning?

408
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,040
It's not a tree she can climb,
so don't even bother?

409
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,260
Since she's a toy for killing time,

410
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:07,461
just accept it if you rich boys
eventually throw her away?

411
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,330
Hey, calm down.

412
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,610
It's scary to see such
a cute lady being angry.

413
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,220
Ga Eul, you really are Jan Di's friend.

414
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:23,250
You think, if you make that expression
with your pretty face, everyone's going to fall for it?

415
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,860
You tried it on the wrong person.
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything today.

416
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,670
Okay then.

417
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,260
It's making me angrier the
more I think about it.

418
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,860
The person who was the pursuer
is that guy, not Jan Di.

419
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,800
Jan Di doesn't have the faintest
notion of climbing that tree!

420
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,260
Yo, Yi Jung

421
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,410
What have you done now?

422
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,250
What do you mean?

423
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,830
There's only one reason why
girls leave here angry.

424
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,830
I don't know.

425
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,610
She's the type that I hate the most...
that kind of person.

426
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,300
What kind of person is that?

427
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,040
There's such a thing.
Whether it's comedy or melodrama,

428
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,660
in the end it results in a typical tragedy.

429
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,550
I hate dealing with unsophisticated people.

430
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,640
You didn't have to make such effort.

431
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,290
Still, it's very important.
It shouldn't fall.

432
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,640
Sorry about that.

433
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,950
It's okay.

434
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,750
Isn't it suffocating in here?

435
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,920
Thank you.

436
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,360
Let's go down after one more song.

437
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:22,570
[Thanks for last night.]

438
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,390
No!

439
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:38,780
No!

440
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,190
NO WAY!

441
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,700
Why did you want to wear
uniforms all of a sudden?

442
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,760
Sometimes... it's nice to have
the atmosphere of a student.

443
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,110
That hair... will it really straighten out?

444
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,440
It's already been two hours.

445
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,950
You're not going to do this
every morning, are you?

446
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,940
A solution will come out eventually.

447
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,240
Straighten it out well.

448
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,820
Yes.

449
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,040
What about me do you hate so much?

450
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,000
What are you not satisfied with?

451
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,690
Your greasy face, the disgusting way you walk,
your stupid curly hair!

452
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,990
Everything is perfectly annoyingly.

453
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,710
It's such an eyesore to see
you bunch wearing street clothes.

454
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,520
And picking on weak kids for fun
with your red cards or whatever

455
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:25,090
with your thoughtlessness!
That's the worst!

456
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,250
Now, let's go!

457
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,550
No, it's probably not.

458
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,100
No, no.

459
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,380
How is that I can't remember anything?

460
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,510
Let's be calm. Let's be calm, Geum Jan Di.

461
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,350
If something did happen, there's no way
nothing's happening now.

462
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,200
Is there? Or not? Is there? Or not?

463
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,390
I'm going crazy.

464
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,420
Hey, hey!

465
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,750
What are you doing?
Let me go.

466
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,270
- Let go while I'm still nice.
- What are you doing?

467
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,200
Are you saying that because your
mouth is already torn open?

468
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:23,640
I can't believe this.

469
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:26,430
No matter what a hell-cat you are.

470
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,160
This is what's scary about people
who don't have much.

471
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,310
I knew you were the world's greatest skank,

472
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,530
but this is a little too much!

473
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,260
Hey! Hey!

474
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,350
Explain yourself in a way I can understand.

475
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,350
I didn't do anything to be treated this way.

476
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:41,970
Are you going to let me go?
Let go. Let go.

477
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,430
Let's go show her.

478
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,400
What's the matter? Let go! Let go!

479
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,040
Hurry up and go.

480
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,040
Let go!

481
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,540
You didn't do anything?

482
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,640
When you trick Jun Pyo,
that's like tricking all of us.

483
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,670
If you badmouth the F4,
that's like badmouthing all of us!

484
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,740
How can you, a girl like dirty mop...

485
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,370
Did you think we'd leave you alone
when you're dirtying Shinhwa High?

486
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,530
Bad girl!

487
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,730
What are you doing?

488
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,690
Who do you think you are to bother her?

489
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,320
Jun Pyo sunbae, don't be tricked!

490
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:02,580
Look at this and snap out of it!

491
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,040
No, Gu Jun Pyo. This isn't the truth.

492
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,250
This is wrong.

493
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:38,000
What went so wrong that a
picture like this was taken?

494
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,580
I don't know.

495
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,500
I think someone's trying to frame me.

496
00:47:43,501 --> 00:47:45,750
You're worth this much?

497
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,500
Were you a girl only worth this much?

498
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,010
Even if they were framing you,

499
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:56,511
are you the type of girl to easily
fall into this sort of trap?

500
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,640
Gu Jun Pyo.

501
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:05,310
Even if you believe it or
not, it doesn't matter.

502
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,310
I don't even know why I'm
trying to defend myself

503
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:10,511
in a situation that
doesn't make any sense.

504
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,560
Either way,

505
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,730
this isn't the truth.

506
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:19,650
I... I really don't know
anything about this!

507
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:28,550
I'm just going to ask you one thing.

508
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,170
The girl in the picture...

509
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,460
Geum Jan Di, is that you?

510
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,490
You said it didn't matter
if I believe it or not.

511
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,120
Right?

512
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,120
Yeah, you're right.

513
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,450
Geum Jan Di,

514
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,860
From now on, I don't know who you are.

515
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,120
Hey! You slutty insect!

516
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,820
Take it off! Take it off!

517
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,050
<i>Take this off. Take it off.</i>

518
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,370
<i>Take it off.</i>

519
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,600
Hey, this is going too far.

520
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,880
At this rate, I wouldn't be
surprised if someone dies.

521
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,200
I think it hasn't been this bad
since Jun Hee's wedding.

522
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,660
Let's hurry up.

523
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:30,100
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure.

524
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,160
Can you just tell me once?

525
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:58,710
First things first, we should find the guy.

526
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,190
You said you met him at a club, right?

527
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,660
I went to ask but they said
they didn't know him.

528
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,790
Then when you opened your eyes that morning,
did you see anything in the room?

529
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,300
A business card or his belongings.

530
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,720
Ah...

531
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,740
He wrote a memo on the mirror.

532
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,070
"Thanks for last night."

533
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,850
In red lipstick.

534
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,710
Wait.

535
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,400
Lipstick?

536
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,810
Yes.

537
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,650
Was it yours?

538
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,920
No.

539
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:36,250
Then, that means it's his.

540
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,890
There are three people.

541
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,600
Stop saying nonsense and go away.

542
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,370
Wait, it's true.

543
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,320
Look.

544
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,860
At this angle, there's no
way he took the picture.

545
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,430
There was a third person in the
room that took this picture.

546
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,650
Then that's... the lipstick owner.

547
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,870
What are you doing?

548
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:08,490
It looks like a smudge but it's not erasing.

549
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,510
This!

550
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:20,250
Let's go.

551
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,660
Wait, wait.

552
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,190
Just leave it to us.

553
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,400
Thanks.

554
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:26,330
Yes...

555
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,700
With those looks, they must
be from Andromeda.

556
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,500
That's a little difficult.

557
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:02,160
I heard that guy is the number one here.

558
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,510
If we take your Number One,
I guess it would hurt you a bit.

559
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,990
Thanks for understanding.

560
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,320
But...

561
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,460
If you don't hand him over, you won't
just be hurting, you'll get closed.

562
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,750
Is that okay?

563
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,700
What?

564
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,160
It'll take about two weeks, right?

565
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,680
We have the F4 reputation.

566
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,510
We should finish it off in a week.

567
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,170
The building next to here, it's yours right?

568
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,640
I can probably start tomorrow.

569
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,050
I should loosen up and get some practice in.

570
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,240
It's who?

571
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,340
{\a6}[For commoner Geum Jan Di,
Shinhwa High tomato party]

572
00:56:03,341 --> 00:56:06,341
[will be held this afternoon. All are invited!!]

573
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,670
Jan Di. Jan Di.

574
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:48,100
I have something urgent to tend to,
so I'll be going first.

575
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,780
Jan Di!

576
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,980
Never mind.

577
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,420
Bye!

578
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,170
One, two, three!

579
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:43,880
Don't be so distressed.

580
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:50,970
For Gu Jun Pyo to act
like this over a slut...

581
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,470
is unbelievable.

582
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,170
Please snap out of it.

583
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,460
This isn't it.

584
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,100
How can Gu Jun Pyo act this way?

585
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,980
This is so unfair!

586
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,980
You...

587
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,990
Weren't you her friend?

588
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,970
Can you say that as her friend?

589
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:30,520
Because she stole you away from me.

590
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,530
Please don't go.

591
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:45,770
Move your hand.

592
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:55,340
What's the reason that Geum Jan Di
is okay but I'm not?

593
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:01,500
What's the reason why Jan Di is okay?!

594
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,010
No, Gu Jun Pyo. This isn't the truth.

595
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,040
This is wrong.

596
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,620
<i>What went so wrong that a
picture like this was taken?</i>

597
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,620
I don't know.

598
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,610
I think someone's trying to frame me.

599
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,380
Is this all you've got?

600
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,350
Do more! Do more!

601
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,830
Attack!

What's that?

612
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,820
The successor of the Shinhwa Group, Gu Jun Pyo!

613
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,590
- What?
- You're so noisy!

614
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,180
What are you doing?

615
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,900
From your uniform, shoes,
to your other belongings,

616
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,140
we've bought a new set last night.

617
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,540
From today on, Geum Jan Di
from grade 2 in classroom B

618
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:21,610
will officially be Gu Jun Pyo's girlfriend.

619
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:25,940
I have opposition to that decision.

620
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,420
Ji Hoo!

621
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,680
Where is this?

622
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,930
New Caledonia.

623
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,780
It's our island that only has our resort.

624
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:37,930
It's Shinhwa Group's.

625
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,720
