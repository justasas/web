1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,288
<Please enjoy freely>
Everyone, take a look.

2
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:07,465
What the...

3
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,373
Doing this kind of things, you people want to ...

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:10,982
Please look at this.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,561
It's not what you think, Domyoji.

6
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:18,528
Please believe me.

7
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:37,418
It's just like you've gotten The Red Paper again.

8
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:43,375
What kind of expression is that?
You've deceived everyone in the school.

9
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:44,603
It cannot be forgiven.

10
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,814
Get her!

11
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:01,125
Stop it! Let me go!

12
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:07,090
You better watch it next time.

13
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,500
Tsukushi-chan.

14
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:24,444
Sakurako.

15
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:29,517
You've... finally come back to school.

16
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:33,667
Don't bother about me. More importantly, are you alright?

17
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:39,451
It's nothing, just some bruises.

18
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:47,341
What's with that guy?

19
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:50,551
That kind of expression...

20
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:52,165
Please believe me.

21
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:58,615
Why... won't he believe me?

22
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:04,833
Tsukushi-chan, let's go look for Domyoji.

23
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:07,377
Huh?

24
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:14,708
Once you explain it to him, he'll understand.
Tsukushi-chan isn't that type of person to do such things.

25
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,687
Are you able to stand?

26
00:02:28,436 --> 00:02:30,753
Thanks, Sakurako.

27
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,435
I'm fine.

28
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:48,049
This is really too much.

29
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:48,934
He's good.

30
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:54,000
Why is he good? I think the innocent Makino Tsukushi
being capable of such pictures, that's unheard of.

31
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,396
What's this guy trying to achieve by doing this?

32
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:58,187
He must be trying to give himself a challenge.

33
00:02:58,187 --> 00:03:01,357
Like wanting to eat mushrooms which have not
yet been classified as poisonous or edible.
** TL's Note: The mushrooms refer to Tsukushi, the person
eating them is the guy who took slept with her **

34
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,116
Domyoji.

35
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:14,292
I... That guy... Nothing happened between us.

36
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:15,853
Please believe me.

37
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,923
With these photos around, how do you expect us to believe you?

38
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:22,167
Even I myself don't fully understand,
how such a thing can happen without my knowing.

39
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:24,188
Obviously, you went with that guy to a Hotel,
and together you took those photos.
** TL's Note: It is normal for a couple to rent a Hotel room
for a night, for the sole purpose of having it **

40
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:28,500
So I'm saying... If anything went on,
I wouldn't have known until I woke up...

41
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:32,875
Ah... That's not what I meant. That's why... In other words...

42
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:40,250
Domyoji-san. Please believe Tsukushi-chan.

43
00:03:40,238 --> 00:03:47,000
Even though... From the photos, Tsukushi-chan appears to have
slept with that man in a Hotel.

44
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,630
The photos are undeniably true.

45
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,583
But, there's definitely a reason behind it.

46
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:53,917
Just shut up! I never asked you...

47
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:55,833
Hey! Sakurako is only helping me explain...

48
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,351
Tsukushi-chan, just keep quiet.

49
00:03:58,147 --> 00:03:58,882
Eh?

50
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:02,737
Domyoji-san, he's already very hurt by what you've done.

51
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:07,189
I only hope that the two of you can make up.

52
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,578
You have already betrayed me.

53
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,012
Haven't I said this already, it's not how you think it is!

54
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:21,583
Who's betraying you? I never had a relationship
with you in the first place.

55
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:24,288
Why do you always say that we do?

56
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:36,792
Oh yea, then you don't need to be here anymore.

57
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:48,083
Yea, then I won't need to waste my time, or yours,
here clearing up this misunderstanding.

58
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,503
I'm leaving!

59
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:58,250
This is so troublesome.
And I thought we could have just resolved it.

60
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,531
Well isn't this actually better?

61
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:04,517
We now know that Makino isn't serious about
having a relationship with Tsukasa.

62
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:11,656
What was that...

63
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,746
Makino isn't the type of person to do those things.

64
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,851
It's because you are the only girl in my eyes.

65
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:20,445
He won't believe me, and yet he says those words.

66
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,611
Ah, it hurts...

67
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:37,692
Commoners are very used to the cold, so it's all right.

68
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:40,647
Don't look down on me, I'm just as tough as wild grass.
("Tsukushi" means "wild grass")

69
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,917
Hamburgers... Delicious meals... Wow, great food...

70
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,193
What on earth are those?

71
00:05:56,193 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh! Tsukushi. These photos were taken by Papa. What do you think?

72
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:02,399
Didn't you notice that the amount has increased?

73
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,925
Papa is such a genius!

74
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:05,830
Really?

75
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,125
Well the next one, shall be our family photo!

76
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,448
Ah, I don't need to be in it.
Just take Mama's photo, that's all.

77
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:16,750
What are you saying? Shouldn't the four of us
be in the family photo, and not just one person?

78
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:19,004
This sort of requirement, it's a problem then.

79
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,602
Come on, quickly...

80
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:24,277
Everyone, smile together!

81
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:30,091
Obviously, someone has to operate it.

82
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:31,514
Oh yea...

83
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:32,875
Tsukushi, you're so smart.

84
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,276
I'll do it...

85
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,166
Really? If you don't mind then...

86
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,226
Come come come come... Everyone, be happy!

87
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:44,173
Yep, cheese...

88
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:54,418
There was definitely need to be another person,
who would take this photograph.

89
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:59,917
I must find the culprit. Sakurako, can you help me out?

90
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,000
Tsukushi-chan, are you doing this for Domyoji-san?

91
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:06,173
Eh?

92
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:09,958
Does it matter to you, how he sees you?

93
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:14,292
He doesn't understand you at all, Tsukushi-chan.

94
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:19,255
That is why you were so mistreated.

95
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:21,129
Have you forgotten?

96
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:23,203
You're right about that, but...

97
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:27,792
My apologies, if you're doing this for Domyoji, I cannot help you.

98
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,950
Eh?

99
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,787
But, no matter what happens,
I'll always be by your side supporting you.

100
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,833
I see, thank you.

101
00:07:37,842 --> 00:07:40,543
Then, I'll contact you again some other time.

102
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,174
Okay, see you.

103
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,909
Been seeing you around here a lot.

104
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:54,937
You even doll up like this, don't be so full of yourself.

105
00:07:54,937 --> 00:08:00,542
I'm sorry, it's not what you think...

106
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,962
Get lost, ugly witches.

107
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:10,528
It should be considered an offense to see such ugly
people like you hanging out around here.

108
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:14,313
Quickly get lost, ugly witches!

109
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:28,933
What's the matter? What happened?

110
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,995
Hana Yori Dango - Boys Over Flowers
Episode 5

111
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:48,912
[Character] ** [Actor]

QC ** mhaellix

121
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:56,833
But isn't that very dangerous,
finding the culprit yourself.

122
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:59,095
You're right about that...

123
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:00,121
What is this?

124
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:01,973
This is "Daifuku".
(A kind of snack that "commoners" eat)

125
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:03,211
Delicious.

126
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,478
Oh? The "mushroom" is back at work.

127
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:06,073
Mushroom?

128
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,813
Oh... It's nothing...

129
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:12,667
Hey... What are you guys doing?

130
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:15,749
Akira just broke up with someone's wife,
so he's feeling a bit lonely now.

131
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:19,238
It's like that for now, so we dropped by here.

132
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:25,000
But still, there's a certain girl who has had
sleazy photographs taken of her in bed,

133
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:27,997
and the most talked about subject in school
is this unfortunate girl.

134
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:31,228
We should really learn from her.
We might find ourselves feeling luckier than in her shoes.

135
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:32,752
In other words, you people are just free.

136
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:34,192
Right!

137
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:37,662
Is this yours?

138
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:39,264
No.

139
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,635
Ah, then whose could it be?

140
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:43,147
Alright, how about playing a detective game.

141
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:44,830
Eh? What?

142
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,034
Yea...

143
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:50,732
We'll help you find the culprit.

144
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:54,299
Isn't that great? Accept their request.

145
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,489
Anyhow, it's better than them staying in this place...

146
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:58,404
If you don't mind, please help me.

147
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:00,366
Alright! Let's start right away.

148
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:01,946
You help Makino fill in for her work.

149
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:02,783
Why me?

150
00:12:02,783 --> 00:12:06,208
I beg of you, it's a crucial opportunity for Tsukushi-chan.

151
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,927
I'm not involved in this.

152
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:19,125
Promotion! Promotion! For each purchase,
you will get a kiss from this fine young man here.

153
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:23,292
Thank you very much. Everyone! Come on in!

154
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:24,100
<Domyoji Residence>

155
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,276
I want to go with you to find the culprit.

156
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:28,870
I am not involved in that at all.

157
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,834
Doesn't Domyoji-san want to quickly find out
who the person behind all this is?

158
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:37,708
And whether anything really happened between
the two of them that night.

159
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,351
This evening, I'll wait for you at the bridge of the Harajuku Shrine.

160
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,632
I won't go.

161
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:51,792
What's with you, just standing there naturally,
acting as if you deserve to.

162
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:53,880
Get out.

163
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,365
Get out!!

164
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:03,592
<Nishikado Residence>

165
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:07,000
Let's hope we can find some leads to the search.

166
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:19,163
Doesn't Domyoji-san want to quickly find out
who the person behind all this is?

167
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:23,257
And whether anything really happened between
the two of them that night.

168
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,019
Excuse me.

169
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:35,177
Didn't you go back to New York?

170
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,961
Were you the one who did this?

171
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:48,304
Did you order someone to take these photos?

172
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:52,361
You don't address me like that.

173
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,287
Don't secretly conduct your own inspections.

174
00:13:57,287 --> 00:14:02,668
You are, after all, the heir to the Domyoji wealth.

175
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:08,284
How can you have a relationship with this sort of girl?

176
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,800
You don't look too happy about this.

177
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:20,625
Love, that useless emotion, it has no meaning at all.

178
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:25,081
Ma'am, it's about time for the scheduled flight.

179
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:57,292
Do you sell this here?

180
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:59,500
As expected of Nishikado-san,
to know that this shop that sells only one of that.

181
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:00,994
Who has bought it before?

182
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:05,042
Well, to release information about individual buyers...

183
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:09,800
How about if I open up a new shop
next to this one...

184
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,450
It was a host who bought it.
** TL Note: In this context, a "host" is someone who works
at a club, like the one Tsukushi met. **

185
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,098
That was fast...

186
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:13,700
Which club?

187
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,060
Well, that...

188
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:21,391
If I buy this whole place, and open
a tea restaurant, that's not a bad idea.

189
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:23,544
Hey you! Go and buy some coffee, and make it quick!

190
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:26,568
Buy it from the club called "S".

191
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:28,372
I got it.

192
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:31,244
Please send everything in this store to my house,
I'm buying it all.

193
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:36,708
Ah, so it's here. That's the club where Reiko-chan is at.

194
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:39,707
Why do even High School students know about such a place?

195
00:15:45,876 --> 00:15:46,966
No way...

196
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,422
Tsukasa, also looking for the culprit?

197
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:55,318
You must be joking.

198
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:57,791
Then what are you two doing?

199
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:07,708
One look and you can tell... Let's go.

200
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:25,352
This is yours, thank you and have a nice day!

201
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:35,262
<Sold Out>

202
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,510
We're all out of food.

203
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,001
I'm very sorry, very very sorry.

204
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,832
Well, I'm done here then.

205
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:46,457
Lady Boss, I want to look for Tsukushi...

206
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:50,792
Certainly! Go with him...

207
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:56,375
Oh, I remember this girl.

208
00:16:57,361 --> 00:17:00,957
Do you know where she went after she left this place?

209
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,035
Oh that... One look at the way she was, and you could tell...

210
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:12,350
Ah, she really was here.

211
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:16,280
Could you tell us the room she was in?

212
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:22,343
How's it going, Tsukushi?

213
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,918
We don't seem to have found him yet.

214
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:29,289
I'll go check if anyone recognises this ring.

215
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:38,044
So handsome...

216
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:45,811
Are you alright?

217
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:48,266
Are you hurt?

218
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,985
Could you get me another glass, please?

219
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:54,033
What's he up to?

220
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:22,542
Tsukushi-chan was in this room, and on that bed,
sleeping together with that other guy.

221
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:52,043
Are you alright?

222
00:18:55,334 --> 00:19:01,042
I... have also been deceived by Tsukushi-chan.

223
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:09,917
I don't like that feeling.

224
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:29,625
Domyoji-san, you feel the same way, right?

225
00:19:47,815 --> 00:19:50,951
Please don't look so down and sad.

226
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:07,250
I will... feel bad... too...

227
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,467
You better watch it.

228
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:26,625
That girl, she's been deceiving me all this while.

229
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,671
Tsukushi.

230
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:03,942
Anything the matter?

231
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:21,500
Yuuki, I really like Hanazawa Rui.

232
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,130
Mm.

233
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:30,792
So from back then till now, the person in my heart
should always be Hanazawa Rui.

234
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:34,644
Just now that guy...

235
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:40,172
Domyoji and Sakurako were walking together...

236
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,212
Even though they weren't close or anything,

237
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:59,417
my heart started to feel the pain,
it really hurts.

238
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:11,000
Hey, watch where you're going!

239
00:22:18,048 --> 00:22:19,571
What is it?

240
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:46,625
In my opinion, love begins when you least expect,

241
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:49,215
Love?

242
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:59,167
No way... How can that guy and I be...

243
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,773
It's Sakurako...

244
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:14,433
Hi.

245
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:17,750
Tsukushi-chan? It's me, Sakurako.

246
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:19,536
Yea.

247
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:23,564
Right now, Domyoji asked me to give you a call.

248
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:30,799
Domyoji-san wants to make up with you, Tsukushi-chan.

249
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,417
Make-up? Domyoji?

250
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:40,125
Come to my place. Domyoji-san is waiting here.

251
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:10,821
Domyoji-san is waiting here.

252
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:15,005
Sorry for making you wait.

253
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:15,891
Next is me!

254
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:18,023
Hurry up and bring me what I ordered.

255
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,109
And my beer too...

256
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:22,070
Thank you for coming, I have something for you.

257
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:25,510
We would like to ask that you come work in this club.

258
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,791
Welcome!

259
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,417
Wait here for me, I'll be right back.

260
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:45,401
Umm... Where is Domyoji?

261
00:24:46,656 --> 00:24:48,219
Let me get some tea first.

262
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:54,942
People are such hateful creatures.

263
00:24:55,524 --> 00:24:59,917
They can betray your trust anytime.

264
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:07,667
The man I once loved, he had two sides of himself.

265
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,599
During the day, he was a hardworking, honest manager (of employees).

266
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,167
During the night, he was a frivilous manager (of women).

267
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,869
Isn't that normal?

268
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:25,708
It was then... that he cruelly deceived... the innocent me.

269
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,642
I have no idea what you're saying.

270
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:31,722
Ah, it's gotten dirty.

271
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:34,056
Are you alright?

272
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:38,374
Thank you.

273
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:42,100
You're such a gentleman, Akira-kun.

274
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:52,333
Who hired you to take those photos?

275
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,375
You bastard!

276
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:03,708
It was someone called Chiri. She paid me to do it.

277
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,745
Chiri?

278
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:10,236
Yea, she said that she was a rich kid studying in Eitoku Kindergarten.

279
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:12,401
Kindergarten?

280
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:21,506
Hi, yes?

281
00:26:21,506 --> 00:26:24,375
Soujiro, it's the maple leaf!

282
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:43,742
NO!

283
00:26:44,614 --> 00:26:45,766
I'm sorry.

284
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:00,346
F4...

285
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:05,397
This would be a photo album of them studying together
when they were young.

286
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:16,663
<Domyoji Tsukasa>

287
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:05,833
Domyoji-san, thank you for accompanying me today.

288
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:10,675
I didn't realise you were so easy to fool.

289
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,063
Huh?

290
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:24,667
You didn't notice? The people at the club, at the hotel,
they were all set up by me.

291
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,129
You...

292
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:29,373
Come to the canteen at Eitoku.

293
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,953
Your beloved Makino Tsukushi is waiting for you here.

294
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:39,792
Come alone, only you and no one else.

295
00:28:39,793 --> 00:28:41,168
Hey, wait...

296
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:55,333
Let go, stop! It hurts!

297
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,875
Hey! Let go of me!

298
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:07,782
I'm used to this kind of reaction from you.

299
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,042
Why? Why are you treating me like this, Sakurako?

300
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,411
Weren't we friends?

301
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:25,167
Friends? Don't kid me.

302
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:30,423
The guy at the club, I paid him to do it.

303
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:36,792
He put sleeping pills in the Oolong Tea to get you
to sleep, I also arranged for that.

304
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,664
And I was the one who took the photos of you in the hotel room.

305
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,540
You've said enough!

306
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,377
You even betrayed your own friend, you're inhumane.

307
00:29:47,377 --> 00:29:49,163
Shut up!

308
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:57,086
There is something I need to do.

309
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:02,108
No one cares about your insignificant feelings.

310
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:11,875
Domyoji and I have been together since kindergarten,
and ever since then I've always wanted my revenge on him.

311
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:15,097
Revenge?

312
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:18,257
It was because of that, that I had to use you.

313
00:30:18,257 --> 00:30:21,708
Sanjyo-san. Here! Here!

314
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:23,955
Meeting you that day was a coincidence,

315
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:31,051
but knocking into Domyoji with the food was pre-planned.

316
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:32,222
Please... forgive her...

317
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:36,341
I never expected you to put up a fight for me.

318
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,628
A brat like you who has never worked hard for money...

319
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:41,925
Go to hell!

320
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:45,711
I will fight you.

321
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,118
And that was how it all began...

322
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:51,653
I really didn't expect you to do what you did.

323
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:57,583
But, what I would never expect to happen, happened...

324
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,525
He actually fell for you.

325
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:08,167
Just what did Domyoji do to make you react like this...?

326
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:13,417
He's been such an idiot, just like he is now,
even from the time when we were young.

327
00:31:13,402 --> 00:31:18,167
I will not forgive him. Never ever!

328
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,891
This will be the last time you'll be of use to me.

329
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,755
Eh?

330
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,998
I want to use you to tempt Domyoji to come to this place.

331
00:31:44,808 --> 00:31:48,625
Tsukasa, are you with Sanjyo Sakurako?

332
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:49,310
Nope.

333
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,458
You must be careful of that girl,
she's really out to get you.

334
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:04,559
Listen here, Tsukasa.

335
00:32:07,874 --> 00:32:10,994
Tsukasa, where are you going?

336
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,531
Home.

337
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,031
You're lying.

338
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:17,273
Where are you going, and what has happened,
you better quickly tell us.

339
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:18,995
Don't go there, Tsukasa!

340
00:32:18,995 --> 00:32:23,250
That girl is dangerous. You never know who might
be there lying in wait for you.

341
00:32:23,236 --> 00:32:24,641
We've just looked through your Kindergarten photo album.

342
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,294
I need to go there.

343
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,805
Then tell us where you are going.

344
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:30,979
We'll go there with you too.

345
00:32:31,855 --> 00:32:34,274
If I wait for you, I won't be able to protect Makino in time.

346
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:12,684
Domyoji won't come.

347
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:21,500
That guy... He doesn't care about me.

348
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:28,292
It's simply because he fell for you that made me so mad!

349
00:33:32,294 --> 00:33:33,656
Makino!

350
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:44,068
Why...?

351
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:48,448
Why did you have to come here, stupid?

352
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:54,292
Makino, I'm sorry. I didn't believe you.

353
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:57,963
I didn't call you here to make your confessions.

354
00:34:01,513 --> 00:34:05,042
You... What do you want?

355
00:34:10,075 --> 00:34:12,903
I want you to show me...

356
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:20,625
How much you really love this girl...

357
00:34:22,296 --> 00:34:27,833
If you retaliate one bit, I will deface her.

358
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:41,088
You underestimate me.

359
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:48,708
Makino, shut your eyes.

360
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,127
Eh?

361
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:52,785
Just do it, shut them.

362
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:18,542
Oh my, your sincerity has surprised me.

363
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,917
Stop it! Stop hitting him!

364
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,515
How does it feel?

365
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:32,667
You're always so high and mighty, and now
you're being beaten like this.

366
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:36,621
You're not happy about something?

367
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:41,783
If you're not happy, then fight back!

368
00:35:42,322 --> 00:35:45,292
Why do you care about what harm is done to this girl's face?

369
00:35:45,282 --> 00:35:48,114
Her face was originally such a mess anyway.

370
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:03,625
Is that all? It didn't hurt one bit.

371
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,735
Continue hitting him!

372
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:22,292
Why are you holding back? You've never been beaten before.

373
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:28,667
You're definitely able to beat all of them if you just fight back.

374
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,095
Why aren't you fighting back?!

375
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:36,686
<Sanjyo Sakurako>

376
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:40,917
She doesn't look at all like the Sanjyo Sakurako we now know.

377
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:45,221
What kind of monster is that girl?

378
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:58,208
It's a bit strange...

379
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:03,250
That's enough already, stop fighting!

380
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:07,500
Why?! Why won't you fight back?!

381
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:11,333
Is holding back for that ugly witch over there really worth it?

382
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:21,044
Why is she the only that can do this?

383
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,744
Why...?

384
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,281
And I even spent so much on making myself beautiful just for you...

385
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:36,071
Is everyone doing great?

386
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:38,617
Yes...

387
00:37:40,751 --> 00:37:44,716
Well then, give what you've done to a person you like.

388
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:47,400
Yes...

389
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:50,362
Tsukasa, for you.

390
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:57,868
Just take it, Tsukasa. Take it...

391
00:37:57,868 --> 00:37:59,853
Get lost, you ugly...

392
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:08,500
You are "Hanapecha" 
and an ugly witch... witch... witch... ugly witch...
("Hanapecha" means "Flat nose")

393
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:13,110
I became such a beauty.

394
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:21,704
I never listened once to Papa's and Mama's advice,

395
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,048
and I even took special leave from school.

396
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:38,833
Everything was re-made, re-did.

397
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:45,390
And still you can't accept me. Why?

398
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:48,690
Makino...

399
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:58,500
If only you would just lie,
and tell me that I was beautiful just once...

400
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:02,688
I really like you. I can't live without you.

401
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,346
Makino...

402
00:39:08,227 --> 00:39:10,692
Why won't you ever say something nice to me?

403
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:35,171
<Tsukasa>

404
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:41,833
I've had... Enough...

405
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,944
Domyoji.

406
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,772
Are you alright?

407
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,701
Domyoji!

408
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:19,417
No... I'm not alright.

409
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:31,833
Why? Why won't you fight back?

410
00:40:34,202 --> 00:40:39,125
I won't be able to protect you, if I had fought back.

411
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:49,125
I'll make this clear, 
it wasn't that I couldn't have beaten all of them.

412
00:40:51,053 --> 00:40:54,255
It was just for you...

413
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,008
Stupid!

414
00:40:58,008 --> 00:40:59,794
You're going in circles.

415
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:02,808
Really?

416
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:06,597
You knew what would happen, and yet you still came...

417
00:41:11,274 --> 00:41:13,363
That's needless to say...

418
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:19,432
I like you.

419
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,233
I really like you.

420
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,406
<One week later>

421
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,087
Tsukasa was admitted to the hospital?

422
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:09,917
Yes. Makino Tsukushi is now looking after him.

423
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,917
That lass is still sticking close to Tsukasa.

424
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:19,678
I think so...

425
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:35,208
Hey! Feed me.

426
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:39,083
Huh? Why do I need to feed you?
You should be able to hold your chopsticks.

427
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:43,237
Why haven't you removed the sling bandage,
it's already been a week.

428
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:45,028
You're probably just trying to get the sympathy of others.

429
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:46,495
Can't you see it still hurts.

430
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:50,750
How romantic. So that's "a fight comes necessary with love".

431
00:42:51,728 --> 00:42:54,401
Didn't you say the more romantic, the better a relationship will be?

432
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:55,442
Never said it.

433
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:58,000
Tsukasa, what'll we do?

434
00:42:57,998 --> 00:42:59,133
What is it?

435
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:01,088
About Sanjyo Sakurako...

436
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:07,801
You come here quickly.

437
00:43:07,801 --> 00:43:09,376
Move it!

438
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,528
You must be in here.

439
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:21,999
I found it in my cousin's house yesterday.

440
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:27,393
Such an ugly person can become so good looking,
it must not have been easy.

441
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:33,882
Witches...

442
00:43:33,882 --> 00:43:36,119
Witch... witch... ugly witch...

443
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,818
What's wrong with that?

444
00:43:47,577 --> 00:43:51,958
Don't you people also have the money to doll yourselves up?

445
00:43:52,582 --> 00:43:55,217
What's wrong with using money to beautify oneself?

446
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:57,197
What's wrong?!

447
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:06,151
Huh!

448
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:24,000
Let me make this clear, this doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

449
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:29,944
Your selfish actions have made me very unhappy.

450
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:42,875
But, you once said that my mom's food was good...

451
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,549
Delicious...

452
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:46,761
Really?

453
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:47,737
Yes!

454
00:44:52,246 --> 00:44:57,208
That should have been the only words that you truly meant.

455
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,249
I'm sorry.

456
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:25,375
Wonderful! I couldn't expect less out of the girl I like.

457
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:26,196
Right?

458
00:45:26,196 --> 00:45:27,573
Yay!

459
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:28,835
Hey stop... Let go...

460
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:30,435
It hurts a lot! What are you doing?

461
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:32,047
You want me to break it again?

462
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:33,803
Huh?

463
00:45:33,803 --> 00:45:35,185
Doesn't that mean it's healed?

464
00:45:35,185 --> 00:45:36,693
Darn! She found out.

465
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:40,038
Darn?! I found out?? You...

466
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:40,732
What was that for, you bastard?

467
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:41,877
You don't have to hit me...

468
00:45:41,877 --> 00:45:44,116
That was totally uncalled for...

469
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,018
You come here...

470
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:46,606
I'm back.

471
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:53,654
I'm back.

472
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:12,750
<Arashi - Wish>
<Promotion for the Single CD>
<Just buy it, k?>

473
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,452
Let's have a "double date" tomorrow.

474
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:19,415
It's all the scary people.

475
00:46:19,415 --> 00:46:20,958
But, haven't you remembered?

476
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:22,176
I never did that.

477
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:23,732
Makino, I...

478
00:46:24,296 --> 00:46:27,258
Do you know where your real enemy is?

479
00:46:27,258 --> 00:46:28,648
This isn't a game!

480
00:46:28,648 --> 00:46:29,766
Here.

481
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:33,339
It's been a while,

482
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:34,401
Yomogi-chan.

483
00:46:34,401 --> 00:46:35,837
I'm Tsukushi.

484
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:37,176
Racing Panda.

485
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:38,669
Raysun Panda.

486
00:46:38,669 --> 00:46:39,320
Huh?

487
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,990
Could you be ...

488
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,585
Tsukasa, what are you doing in a place like this?

489
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:43,527
It's not good!

490
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:44,472
Huh?

491
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:47,133
They allowed me to stay here.

492
00:46:47,524 --> 00:46:49,393
I don't ever want to see you again.
