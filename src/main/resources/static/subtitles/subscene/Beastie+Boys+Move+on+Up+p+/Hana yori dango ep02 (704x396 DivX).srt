1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,917
This is unbelievable!

2
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:09,375
Eitoku Gakuen, one of the most exlusive
private schools in Japan, and filled with the rich.

3
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:14,292
Leading this school would be the
most wealthy, most influential.

4
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:18,250
The band of four guys,
also known as "Flower 4", or F4.

5
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:20,958
Those who annoy them will receive The Red Paper,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,625
and they will be ostracised
and bullied by the rest of the school populace.

7
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:29,542
I only hope to get through school
without any trouble.

8
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,042
The Red Paper!

9
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,083
Makino Tsukushi has gotten The Red Paper!

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:39,917
But, even if I'm hated in school,
I will not concede defeat.

11
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,917
I am just as tough as wild grass.
(Her first name "Makino" translates to "Pasture")

12
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:48,458
One look and I can tell that some old woman
made this low quality stuff.

13
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:54,375
Brats like you have never worked hard for money.

14
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:56,667
Go to hell!

15
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,292
I will not run, I will stay and fight.

16
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,667
My my... She got The Red Paper
and won't even come to school.

17
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,378
How uninteresting.

18
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:32,792
She deserves it.
She dared to offend Domyoji by doing such things.

19
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,458
Well, maybe she's been expelled already?

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,417
My my, how cruel of you.

21
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,917
Where am I?

22
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:51,667
This is a surprise.

23
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,167
Yea.

24
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:03,619
Well then, let's get to work.

25
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:05,028
Alright.

26
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:57,976
What's the meaning of this?

27
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:21,226
What are you trying to do?

28
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,761
Why dress me up like this?

29
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,502
Get rid of it.

30
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:27,898
What?

31
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:32,172
Didn't you want to fight me? Get rid of that idea.

32
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:34,172
You've got to be kidding.

33
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:36,538
1 hundred million.

34
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:37,441
Huh?

35
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:40,314
What you're wearing,
that's about how much it costs.

36
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,695
1 hundred million?!

37
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:47,192
Make-up and getting you hair done,
that's about 10 million.

38
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:49,284
The evening gown, that's another 20 million.

39
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:51,670
And there's the jewellery.

40
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,847
All these add up to about 1 hundred million yen.

41
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:58,010
This can't be.

42
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:04,202
Are... Are you planning on using these to buy me off?

43
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,202
There is no need.

44
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:12,826
I can give you anything you want.

45
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:18,323
Huh? Why would you do this?

46
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,593
What's so funny?
You think I'm going to like these things?

47
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:28,583
It's disgusting.

48
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,454
Then why are you lost for words?

49
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:36,601
You really are lost for words.

50
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:39,335
That's because...

51
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:44,573
One's heart can be easily bought with money.

52
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:52,385
You're no different. You're just a commoner.

53
00:04:54,883 --> 00:05:01,621
Smile. You must be very happy
to be able to wear these

54
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:04,728
Come on, smile.

55
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:06,982
I'm asking you to smile!

56
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:11,345
Have you lost your mind? How can I smile about this?

57
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:15,670
What you've done,
I'm not the least happy about it.

58
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:21,186
There are also things in this world
which cannot be bought with money.

59
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:31,554
I will not concede defeat.
Don't treat me like any ordinary girl.

60
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,700
What on earth is that guy trying to do?

61
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,507
To think that I'll admit defeat so easily...

62
00:05:49,214 --> 00:05:52,252
Speaking of which, where is my uniform?

63
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,688
What a beautiful person.

64
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:20,424
This isn't the time to praise other people.

65
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:26,211
My goodness, one table
is more than enough.

66
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,390
What a strange place.

67
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:35,122
What?? Is this Harry Potter or what?

68
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:39,270
This can't be happening.

69
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:50,023
Where on earth could my uniform be?

70
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,678
Er... Wait a minute...

71
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,906
What? What?

72
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,050
What are you doing? No no no no! Stop!

73
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:40,720
I will not run. I will fight you. If you have guts then come on.

74
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,654
Tsukasa!

75
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,126
Don't be so cocky about it.

76
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:53,989
There is a conference at 4pm.
And dinner is at 6pm.

77
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:34,060
My goodness, why is this house so huge?

78
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:44,964
Come to think of it,
I've made very powerful enemies.

79
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,055

Editor and Release ** Yoshitsune

89
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:57,167
I say, Makino Tsukushi should have already been
drowned at Tokyo Bay.

90
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:02,771
Of course.
She even dared to hit Domyoji in front of everyone.

91
00:11:02,771 --> 00:11:04,609
She should be dead by now.

92
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm still alive, dammit.
Got a problem with that?

93
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:17,197
But really, shouldn't it better to
leave this school right away for good?

94
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:20,091
Well really,
you'd only be saying such things

95
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,883
before you're forced to leave.

96
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:47,684
Makino Tsukushi

97
00:11:47,717 --> 00:11:50,687
Slept with men 5 times,
Extremely lewd.

98
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,329
Who wrote this?

99
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:57,868
Writing such insulting words in a place like this.
This the first time it happened.

100
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:01,157
Really? How heartless.

101
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:02,385
Even if it was carelessly written,

102
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:04,893
I won't be able to show my face
if such things happened.

103
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:08,588
But... But... It's so heartless.
We can't compare at all.

104
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:22,802
What the hell... That bastard...

105
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:25,248
His head is full of shit.

106
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:31,705
Really,
I'm still a virgin.

107
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:50,345
Hmm. So you're still a virgin.

108
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,238
Hey, please don't make fun of me.

109
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:09,563
Do you know the time difference
between Japan and France?

110
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:11,563
Eh?

111
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,802
Time difference.

112
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:18,568
I... I don't know.

113
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,543
Oh.

114
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:40,233
Wait a minute,
why is Hanazawa-san and that girl together?

115
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,670
It's been said already,
that girl...

116
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,076
How hateful.

117
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,269
Thanks for buying.

118
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:51,857
Time difference eh...

119
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:57,258
Hmm... The time difference between
Japan and France...

120
00:13:57,979 --> 00:14:01,086
Found it!

121
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:06,131
It's 8 hours.

122
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,126
I'll tell him tomorrow.

123
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:11,746
You seem very happy.

124
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:12,812
What?

125
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:14,964
Isn't that guy a member of F4?

126
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:16,682
He's one of those who hands out
The Red Paper.

127
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:20,378
The Red Paper,
it's probably Domyoji's doing.

128
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,868
I don't think Hanazawa Rui
likes doing those sort of things.

129
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:27,939
The situation must be very troubling for you now.

130
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:36,057
But he didn't stop it from happening.
That makes him guilty as well.

131
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:38,090
I don't think he's guilty.

132
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,090
Why are you defending him.

133
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,496
No particular reason.

134
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,260
What kind of person is he?

135
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,483
Well that...

136
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:47,962
I have no idea what he thinks about.

137
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:50,977
He's a bit cold.

138
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:54,015
But sometimes that's really cool.

139
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,487
His legs are also long and nice,
like a those of a model's.

140
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:03,541
His eyes are bright like marbles,
like there's no trace of dust at all.

141
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:06,143
He's just a bit callous.

142
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:07,929
Maybe you like him?

143
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,323
What's wrong with you, Yuuki?

144
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:14,809
Are you trying to flatter me?

145
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:16,607
Ah...

146
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:19,488
What was that for?

147
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,905
Don't tell me...

148
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,820
I've done it before.

149
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:32,632
Oh no,
our shop needs to be run by virgins.

150
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,312
What do you mean by "virgins"?

151
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:37,077
I don't know either.

152
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:41,756
You girls only appear virgins.

153
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:45,006
But in actual fact...

154
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:49,417
It must be like this.

155
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,980
Oh you're mistaken.

156
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,007
I was referring to kissing,
just kissing.

157
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:57,000
What? Just kissing.

158
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:00,283
But how I envy you.

159
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:04,359
You girls aren't that young anymore.

160
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:07,597
If you haven't kissed before,

161
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:10,121
This is why we can't sell any of our set meals.

162
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:11,964
Is there any relation at all?

163
00:16:11,964 --> 00:16:15,906
Let's stop talking about women.

164
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:23,712
You two should carefully choose guys
who have not been kissed before.

165
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:25,343
What does that mean?

166
00:16:26,593 --> 00:16:32,401
I've said this before,
I've known a man with a similar background.

167
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:36,756
Although he's a extremely rich guy,

168
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:41,725
you can never tell what he's thinking.

169
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:47,331
As a result,
I was dumped to this company to work.

170
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:51,006
How cruel of him.

171
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,006
I...

172
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,601
What's wrong with her?

173
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:59,281
Eh... Tsukushi.

174
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:07,355
Sakurako.

175
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:14,491
My luck is no good at all.

176
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,093
Don't get so worked up
during a game of Mahjong.

177
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:19,561
You must act the world famous Domyoji
you are.

178
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:20,119
Shut up.

179
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,582
That is mine.
(A term used in Mahjong)

180
00:17:22,364 --> 00:17:26,619
I don't think it's your luck.
It's that Makino Tsukushi girl that's bothering you.

181
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,260
Shut up and play.

182
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,946
But, what does she really like?

183
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:35,363
I spent so much money on her today,
but I couldn't get her to like it.

184
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:38,501
Yea, she's so annoying,
yet so aggresive.

185
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:40,388
Sometimes, I don't feel like bullying her.

186
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:43,136
Yea. Very tenacious.

187
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,744
That move of hers was very nice.

188
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:46,542
Just like Tsukasa's older sister.

189
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,239
Indeed.

190
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:51,053
Tsukasa, don't get too cocky.

191
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,053
Shut up. Hurry up and play.

192
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:55,934
Tsukasa, it's your turn.

193
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:58,402
Yea, I know.

194
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:01,059
But, Tsukasa, you're really easy to understand.

195
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:04,935
Yea. All your thoughts can be easily
seen from your expressions.

196
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,725
Why don't you just scare her?

197
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:12,696
Ah. Game for me.

198
00:18:12,696 --> 00:18:13,969
Me too.

199
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:19,195
I won't play anymore.

200
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:21,261
Where are you going?

201
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:23,629
Going to fetch that hated person.

202
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:26,030
Was he talking about Rui?

203
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,783
Maybe...

204
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,380
He's calling Rui "that hated person"?

205
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,111
Maybe the layman is stronger than you think.

206
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,719
Yea.

207
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:37,778
But I doubt he'll come.
That Rui only knows how to hide in remote places.

208
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:41,128
If you bring him here, he'll be very uneasy.

209
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:54,552
I'm very sorry. Tsukushi-chan saved me, but I...

210
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,310
Don't worry so much about it.

211
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,928
Really, if they see you here,
there's going to be a lot of trouble.

212
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,928
But...

213
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:08,210
You don't have to force yourself
to be friends with me in school.

214
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:12,732
If you want to talk just drop me a call.

215
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:17,244
That fella won't go to such an extent.
Alright?

216
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,354
I'm really sorry for everything.

217
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:28,914
Ah...

218
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:33,147
This person should be... an Eitoku graduate.

219
00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:39,501
Toudou Shizuka.
Heiress to the large Toudou corporation.

220
00:19:40,093 --> 00:19:41,835
Also a very famous model worldwide.

221
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:45,040
Her aspiration is to become
an internation lawyer.

222
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,542
You seem to know a lot.

223
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:53,114
It's because of her that I chose Eitoku Gakuen.

224
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:58,374
Please choose your path in life.

225
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:02,774
Oh I see.

226
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:07,330
Ah...

227
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,994
What's wrong?

228
00:20:08,994 --> 00:20:10,994
It's F4's...

229
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:17,761
Hanazawa Rui.

230
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:25,846
Wait here for a while.

231
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:41,101
What are you doing here?

232
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:44,418
Oh it's you again.

233
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:48,014
I know the time difference, it's 8 hours.

234
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:53,396
Do you know someone in France?
Or you're going on a holiday?

235
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,567
8 hours...

236
00:21:04,452 --> 00:21:11,119
Ah... If I remember correctly,
the papers said that this person was from our school.

237
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,476
Have you seen her in person?

238
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,546
I really want to become like her.

239
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:36,257
You have something on your face.

240
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,323
It's something like a white grain.

241
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:46,632
That must be from what I ate just now.
(Dai Fuku)

242
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:49,402
"Dai Fuku"?

243
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:55,410
Oh... it's... nothing.

244
00:21:57,252 --> 00:21:58,559
I'll be off.

245
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:04,411
Let's go.

246
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:04,983
The Red Paper!

247
00:23:06,837 --> 00:23:09,607
The Red Paper has appeared again!

248
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:18,496
This time, the person who got it is
Sanjou Sakurako from class 3A.

249
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:02,507
Sakurako!

250
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:11,374
Are you okay?

251
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,277
I'm shocked.

252
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:18,700
Oh, how pitiful.

253
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,470
How unfortunate.

254
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:31,263
Why don't you people stop it.

255
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,737
Your main target should be me.

256
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:38,578
Don't get so high and mighty.
You're just a commoner after all.

257
00:24:41,526 --> 00:24:44,318
So what if one has money, dumbass?

258
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,758
This has absolutely nothing to do with Sakurako.

259
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:48,763
Have you...

260
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:51,946
gotten it wrong?

261
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:53,956
Eh?

262
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:58,233
It was you who wanted to fight me.

263
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:03,258
As long you suffer,
it's the same thing.

264
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:04,442
Take this!

265
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,419
Are you all right? Domyoji-san.

266
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:42,267
I'm going to kill you!

267
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,435
Stop it!

268
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:56,963
Stop it!

269
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:02,971
That's enough.

270
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:27,841
Lick it clean.

271
00:26:29,773 --> 00:26:31,057
Huh?

272
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:37,233
Lick it clean.
Then I'll let her go.

273
00:26:48,512 --> 00:27:34,455
Lick it clean... Lick it clean...

274
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:49,409
You got it all wrong.

275
00:27:59,973 --> 00:28:01,269
The time difference...

276
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,920
The time difference.

277
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:11,397
It should be 7 hours,
because they use summer time during October.

278
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,394
I'm sorry.

279
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:23,972
Forget it.

280
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,401
Right. Disperse now.

281
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,401
The show's over.

282
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:13,534
What...

283
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:38,437
So what if one has money, dumbass.

284
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:58,851
It should be 7 hours,
because they use summer time during October.

285
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:37,781
Hi there. Makino.

286
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,389
Good luck!

287
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:45,230
Good morning, Makino.

288
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:54,454
Tsuki. It's Tsuki.
(Tsuki is a nickname for Tsukushi)

289
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:55,861
Tsuki??

290
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:59,402
That spot isn't clean yet.

291
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:00,764
Make it cleaner.

292
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:02,126
It must be clear and spotless.

293
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,025
Yea, yea... Hurry up.

294
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:05,711
What??

295
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:10,949
Ah... Tsuki, my apologies for yesterday.

296
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,278
To be honest,

297
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:15,941
I thought Domyoji-san was pushing
things a bit too far yesterday.

298
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:20,240
Things wouldn't be good if
Hanazawa-san had not turned up.

299
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,993
Yea...

300
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:25,913
But really, I think he's been defeated by Tsuki.

301
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:30,637
It feels good to see Domyoji lose,
doesn't it?

302
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:32,524
Yea...

303
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,680
Right? Tsuki.

304
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:38,499
Party?

305
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:43,770
Miss Toudou's welcoming party,
they asked if I would like to go.

306
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:47,958
Isn't that great?

307
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:49,655
Yea, I guess.

308
00:31:49,655 --> 00:31:55,094
Ever since you entered Eitoku Gakuen,
have you attended such a party before?

309
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,339
Nope, never once.

310
00:31:57,339 --> 00:31:59,583
Then go for this one! I'm happy for you.

311
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:05,971
Everyone can get to know you better.

312
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:13,263
But, what kind of people
will go to the party?

313
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:14,927
It doesn't matter.

314
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:17,027
Oh yea, won't that handsome guy
with the long slender legs

315
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:19,260
and shining eyes go as well?

316
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,717
If anything happens,
he'll be there to help you.

317
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:25,659
No, I can't possibly hope for such things to happen.

318
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:28,507
Oh well, you should still go.

319
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,766
I'll accompany you.

320
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:38,871
No need.

321
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:42,455
We're all doomed.

322
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:47,425
We should save what as far as on food,

323
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:51,579
then we can afford to buy Tsukushi a party dress.

324
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:57,029
Well, at least Tsukushi get's to
attend one of those high class parties.

325
00:32:58,749 --> 00:33:02,881
Sis can finally be one of the high class ladies.

326
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:05,673
Don't exaggerate so much.

327
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:09,514
Parties are nothing but gatherings which
you can wear jeans to.

328
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:13,367
You don't need to stinge on food specially
for this party.

329
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:15,712
No... We need to.

330
00:33:15,712 --> 00:33:17,957
You'd never know when you meet your Prince Charming.

331
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:22,134
You're from Eitoku Gakuen,
so you need to dress nicely.

332
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:26,154
Yep. Tsukushi you must make all the necessary preparations.

333
00:33:26,232 --> 00:33:28,287
What on earth are you talking about?

334
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:30,453
Only then would losing be winning.

335
00:33:30,453 --> 00:33:32,352
So you're saying admitting defeat
is gaining victory?

336
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:35,881
You can't run away,
this is a good time to find a boyfriend.

337
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,042
You're right.

338
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:41,208
But really, you're very lucky.

339
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,905
What?

340
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,708
I'm only going to show my face, that's all.

341
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:57,638
Let's remember the love we had at "AMANDARI"
two years ago.

342
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,439
Why are you sitting so far from each other?

343
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:05,645
No particular reason.

344
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:08,057
No particular reason?
Today is supposed to be a happy day.

345
00:35:08,057 --> 00:35:10,324
She will be arriving shortly.
Looking forward to it?

346
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:13,250
Smile a bit more.
I bet you didn't sleep much last night.

347
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,300
Aww shush.

348
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:17,014
But, why is Shizuka so late?

349
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:30,605
I'm back.

350
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,011
Shizuka.

351
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:44,229
Haven't seen you for a while.
You've become more handsome.

352
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,954
I've really missed you.

353
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:48,193
Me too.

354
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,694
Long time no see. I'm back.

355
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:57,775
I'm back, still doing well?

356
00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:58,836
Of course.

357
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:00,377
Long time no see.

358
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:01,974
How have you been?

359
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:03,616
Good, of course.

360
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:10,919
Something doesn't seem right.
Anything happened that's bothering you?

361
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,282
Nothing much.

362
00:36:12,282 --> 00:36:15,844
Well, Shizuka has become more
of a lady now.

363
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:18,100
Gotten yourself a French man yet?

364
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:19,931
Not yet.

365
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:23,081
Rui, how bout you?
Have you got a girlfriend yet?

366
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,828
Nope.

367
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:30,931
That won't do. You have to experience
the love and beauty of companionship.

368
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:38,414
You really were beautiful.
You appeared in a magazine all dressed up.

369
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:43,774
Rui, Shizuka's standards are too high.
Are you being sour about that?

370
00:36:44,176 --> 00:36:45,862
No such thing.

371
00:36:46,722 --> 00:36:51,178
I don't think it changes anything
if she dressed up or not.

372
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:55,422
Shizuka is different from the other models.

373
00:36:56,606 --> 00:36:59,554
Rui keeps praising me

374
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:01,554
I really like this kind of Rui.

375
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,322
Thanks

376
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:19,075
W... Wow...

377
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:29,081
Beautiful...

378
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:59,702
Makino-san, you're really late.

379
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:03,912
Why are you dressed like that?
Why didn't you wear a nightgown?

380
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:06,313
But... Didn't you say I can dress
however I like?

381
00:38:06,313 --> 00:38:10,981
Oh that... We were just joking.

382
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:13,125
You even wore a flower.

383
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:19,000
Well, your clothes really aren't that important.
Cheer up.

384
00:38:20,016 --> 00:38:21,992
F4 has arrived!

385
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:30,000
So handsome...

386
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:06,361
You were... Shizuka-san's high school classmate?

387
00:39:06,986 --> 00:39:09,354
No... I'm...

388
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:14,647
That's... very nice, very unique.

389
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:16,925
Really?

390
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:20,130
She really is very unique.

391
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:25,368
She's famous for that in school.

392
00:39:25,368 --> 00:39:29,265
And, she even slept with others
5 times.

393
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,041
I see...

394
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:34,068
So it was you people who wrote those words.

395
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:35,609
What are you saying?

396
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:39,238
How could you even suspect your friends?

397
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:41,952
Dissappointing.

398
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:47,435
Look who's dissapointing.
What have I done to you?

399
00:39:47,435 --> 00:39:49,233
You're an eyesore.

400
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:53,142
Always staring perversely at Hanazawa.

401
00:39:53,197 --> 00:40:00,322
In order to be women worthy of F4,
we had to spend large amounts of time and money.

402
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:02,377
We're not on the same level as you.

403
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:05,984
Furthermore,
how can someone like you come to our school?

404
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:08,787
If you're poor,
you should have just quit.

405
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:10,787
It doesn't concern you.

406
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:14,125
Please leave now...

407
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:19,731
If you don't want to be laughed at
by your favourite Hanazawa-san.

408
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:25,103
But I'm sure Hanazawa-san won't even
bother about girls like her.

409
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:28,732
That's because he's already...

410
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,641
Do you get it?
Hanazawa already has a beautiful woman...

411
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:57,344
like Todou Shizuka.

412
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:03,776
If you get it, then get out of here.

413
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:06,970
Oh I'm sorry, it slipped.

414
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,471
Besides, you're already such an eyesore.
This is supposed to be a happy occasion for Shizuka-san.

415
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:14,664
You still don't understand the
situation you're in.

416
00:41:14,664 --> 00:41:17,099
If you don't return home soon,
you'll going to catch a cold.

417
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,841
Hurry up and go.

418
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:22,303
You wet... slut.

419
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,847
You seem a bit wet.

420
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:33,247
Don't you have a handerchief?

421
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:36,229
I don't.

422
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:40,774
My my... Makino-san can't even afford a handerchief.

423
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:49,764
Thank you.

424
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:01,925
What an interesting welcoming ceremony.

425
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:03,623
Shizuka-san.

426
00:42:03,623 --> 00:42:05,957
Long time no see.

427
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,235
You're really beautiful today.

428
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,457
I really thank you for coming
to this party.

429
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,339
I really appreciate it.

430
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:36,131
Erm... Why did you help me?

431
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,671
Rui mentioned a very interesting girl.

432
00:42:42,888 --> 00:42:45,501
I knew it was you the moment
I saw you.

433
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:48,617
How?

434
00:42:50,828 --> 00:42:52,559
But still, I'm quite surprised.

435
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:57,461
Rui has never had any interest in a girl,
yet he offered his help to you.

436
00:42:58,846 --> 00:43:02,956
Maybe, Rui has already fallen for you.

437
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:07,590
It can't be.
It'll never happen.

438
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,109
Because...

439
00:43:10,014 --> 00:43:13,498
What do you think about this pair of shoes?

440
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:22,979
This pair must be very expensive.
I don't need it.

441
00:43:23,593 --> 00:43:28,228
In Paris,
they say girls should wear shoes that...

442
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:30,573
make them feel like they're flying.

443
00:43:32,103 --> 00:43:37,877
They will bring us to many wonderful places.

444
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:42,455
Don't you feel it's beautiful?

445
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,889
It really is beautiful.

446
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,315
You're very pretty.

447
00:44:57,144 --> 00:45:02,180
Have you lost your mind?
How can I smile about this?

448
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:14,911
Hey,
what madness has caused you to like this girl?

449
00:45:17,603 --> 00:45:19,736
This girl has gotten The Red Pape beforer.

450
00:45:21,824 --> 00:45:24,984
You're still as pushy as ever.

451
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:28,011
Tsukasan-san, don't you think she's pretty?

452
00:45:32,545 --> 00:45:37,246
Even if you're Shizuka,
I do not permit you to speak to me like that.

453
00:45:37,246 --> 00:45:39,000
Well then I...

454
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:46,113
will not forgive those who speak to Shizuka
in that way.

455
00:45:59,939 --> 00:46:01,268
Hey wait a minute!

456
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,806
It can't be...

457
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:10,771
Doesn't look to bad...

458
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:22,017
You still consider yourself a man?

459
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,027
I beg of you Shizuka-san.

460
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:24,898
Go back.

461
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:27,165
That guy really seems to
like Tsukushi-chan.

462
00:46:27,165 --> 00:46:28,963
I really like you.

463
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:49,478
Bye bye... Hanazawa Rui...
