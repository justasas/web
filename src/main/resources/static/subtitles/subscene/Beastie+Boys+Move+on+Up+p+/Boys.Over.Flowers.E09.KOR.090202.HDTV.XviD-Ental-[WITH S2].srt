Episode 9

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,539
<i>You're being so noisy!</i>

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,939
<i>Be quiet!</i>

6
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,153
<i>- This tastes really good.
- Just put it there.</i>

7
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:19,364
Butler Lee...

8
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:21,199
Why is it so loud?

9
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:23,407
<i>It's about time for him to wake up!</i>

10
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:24,530
<i>What do I do?</i>

11
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:27,496
Butler Lee!

12
00:00:27,598 --> 00:00:28,431
<i>Dad!</i>

13
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:31,878
<i>You're being so noisy!</i>

14
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,824
<i>Be quiet!</i>

15
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:51,812
Did you sleep well?

16
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:10,596
There's nothing much on the table,
but I hope you eat a lot, Son-in-law!

17
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:20,833
<i>Eat quickly... while it's hot.</i>

18
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,536
Honey, steamed rib.

19
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:30,939
Oh, yes, yes.

20
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:33,060
<i>You need to eat this, too.</i>

21
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,911
<i>I cooked it for long time, so it became tender.</i>

22
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:38,411
It tastes very good.

23
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:41,536
Why...

24
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,164
Are you okay?

25
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:47,413
<i>Son-in-law, here!</i>

26
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:54,463
Brother-in-law, can't you just live with us from now on?

27
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,022
This kid!

28
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:59,441
We don't even have these kinds of food on holidays!

29
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:02,450
<i>I've never seen a food table like this in our house!</i>

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,791
Where's Jun Pyo?

31
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:42,230
He's still sleeping.

32
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:44,351
Tell him to come down.

33
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,536
Leave him alone.

34
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:51,171
He was with his F4 friends until it became late.

35
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:56,199
I can't believe he's still hanging out
with those kids at this kind of time.

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,549
What's wrong with those kids?

37
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,576
Don't you know how great it is
that Jun Pyo has friends like them?

38
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:07,096
For a Shinhwa Group heir,
friends shouldn't be, and aren't needed.

39
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:08,032
Mom.

40
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:10,750
No one will dare to compete with him,

41
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:14,337
and he should be cold enough
to cut even his family if he needed to.

42
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,458
Have you still not understood that?

43
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,878
I think it'd be better to sleep,
instead of trying to understand that.

44
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,949
Are you saying that,

45
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,025
there are not even a few times
that I eat breakfast with you like this?

46
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:30,551
Well, is that really our fault?

47
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:33,308
Bring him here.

48
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,461
Never mind.

49
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:42,126
I'll go.

50
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:12,543
Gu Jun Pyo! I'm going in.

51
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,413
Where is this child?

52
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:40,072
I'm asking you why I don't see Jun Pyo!

53
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,448
Kimjang?

54
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,448
<i>{\a6}Kimjang means cooking a lot of kimchi for winter</i>

55
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:46,521
You're saying the four of you are going to eat all of this?

56
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:48,811
It's not like all you eat is kimchi.

57
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:49,655
No, Hyung!

58
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,229
That's all we eat,kimchi!

59
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,709
Prices have been rising, so this is actually

60
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,549
less than how much we used to make before.

61
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,302
<i>Come on, let's get ready.</i>

62
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:58,437
<i>Let's get ready!</i>

63
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:01,486
<i>Okay, I'm starting!</i>

64
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,822
Oh, how great it feels!

65
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,937
Hey, is it fun?

66
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:37,559
<i>Here, I brought it.</i>

67
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,609
<i>Honey, bring the salted seafoods too.</i>

68
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,024
<i>More, more.</i>

69
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:46,237
Honey, is this the salted seafoods?

70
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:46,571
Yeah.

71
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,474
Do you want me to do it?

72
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:08,930
Here, Son-in-law!

73
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:17,686
Here, here!

74
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:11,960
Honey, we're here!

75
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:13,460
Be quiet!

76
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,195
Honey, our son-in-law has sensitive skin,

77
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:20,442
so you can't be too harsh on him, okay?

78
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:21,711
Don't worry!

79
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:22,894
Son-in-law!

80
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:26,871
I'll prepare a cold glass of coffee milk, okay?

81
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,393
Get clean!

82
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:59,463
One... two... three!

83
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,432
It's fish cake!

84
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,966
Miss, give us six!

85
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,371
Two for each.

86
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:32,125
Here!

87
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,788
It's good.

88
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:51,240
Of course it's good!

89
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,676
This is really good, really!

90
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,575
I can eat more, right?

91
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:58,423
Of course, eat as much as you want!

92
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:03,530
As much as you want, as much as you want.

93
00:12:19,825 --> 00:12:21,936
What's wrong with that kid?

94
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:25,027
Did he eat something weird at Geum Jan Di's house?

95
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:29,755
Jun Pyo, did you really go to Geum Jan Di's house yesterday?

96
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:32,897
You guys, have you ever made kimchi before?

97
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:34,572
What?

98
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,290
No, right?

99
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:43,348
Then did you ever wash at the public bath?

100
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:45,488
What are you talking about?

101
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:49,773
You never even ate fish cakes at a food stand either, right?

102
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,852
Do you guys even know about life?

103
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,548
It was better when he used to get his sayings wrong.

104
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:12,508
I'm scared of Geum Jan Di more than tiger or smallpox.

105
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:12,445
<i>{\a6}In Korean fairy tales, tiger and smallpox are the most scary things.</i>

106
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:48,150
Sunbae!

107
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:03,410
It seems like you have a lot of worries these days.

108
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:07,077
It is because of Jun Pyo?

109
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:18,944
You're going to catch a cold.

110
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:27,400
It's okay.

111
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:29,772
Thank you.

112
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,457
This is really warm.

113
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,826
Can I give you a piece of advice?

114
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,244
Huh?

115
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:38,183
Don't try to avoid.

116
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:40,503
Sunbae...

117
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:45,619
Who was it that told me that avoidance is a cowardly thing to do?

118
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,414
Sunbae...

119
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:52,267
Don't avoid, but give him a chance.

120
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:05,370
Honestly, I don't like being in Gu Jun Pyo's world.

121
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:09,909
Jun Pyo's world... Jan Di's world.

122
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,685
There's no such thing.

123
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,063
Just like you and I are in the same world right now.

124
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:27,368
If you don't like his world,
then you can bring him to yours.

125
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:31,504
Isn't that Geum Jan Di's major?

126
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,472
I'll try to follow your advice.

127
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,874
Thanks, Sunbae.

128
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:43,964
See you again.

129
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:23,920
<i>Don't be like that, and just call her first.</i>

130
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,646
Think well.

131
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:30,503
You're agreeing to be her slave if you call her first.

132
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,167
I'm not going to call.

133
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:36,209
Just watch if I even move a finger until she says to meet first.

134
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:37,103
That's right.

135
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:38,201
Good job, Gu Jun Pyo!

136
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:43,651
That's the first amendment of the guide
to being a player, pushing and pulling.

137
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:46,208
How can you say something like that while watching him?

138
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,699
He's going crazy for the withdrawal symptoms of Gum Jan Di.

139
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,259
She's calling.

140
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:55,572
Be calm!

141
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,051
Act as if you don't care.

142
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:58,811
You know, right?

143
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,297
Hello.

144
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:12,360
Geum Jan Di?

145
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:15,573
Who's that?

146
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:17,650
That's just going a bit overboard.

147
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:18,455
A bit?

148
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:20,125
You mean a lot.

149
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:24,288
Oh! Oh, I remember!

150
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,658
What's up with you?

151
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:29,653
Do you think this Gu Jun Pyo is always free of time?

152
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:33,836
I'm so busy, that I didn't even know that you didn't call
for three days and thirteen hours.

153
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:37,016
Hey man... woh, woh.

154
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,481
It's embarrassing that he's my friend.

155
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:41,387
What?

156
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,648
Who do you think I am?

157
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,655
Why would I go anywhere with people I don't know?

158
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:49,413
I'm not going!

159
00:17:49,414 --> 00:17:50,726
I'm hanging up!

160
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,980
Did you see that?

161
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,139
Did you?

162
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,632
You saw me yelling at her, right?

163
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:05,252
I even hung up on her first.

164
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:06,822
But why were you yelling?

165
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:09,722
She was saying to go on a double date or something like that.

166
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:13,078
Double date? With who?

167
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,515
You mean... Ga Eul?

168
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,765
That's quite a feat, for that girl.

169
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:20,940
Jun Pyo, you're not going to go?

170
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,374
A date is something that two people do.

171
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:28,190
How old fashioned.
She said to meet in front of a hamburger shop.

172
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,237
Then maybe I should go there instead.

173
00:18:30,238 --> 00:18:31,362
What?

174
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:32,968
Why would you go there?

175
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:35,398
Well... I want to see how commoners date.

176
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:36,654
That sounds like fun.

177
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:38,101
Shut up!

178
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:41,255
Come to the shooting range by ten tomorrow.

179
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:43,105
You got that?

180
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:51,734
There's no way he's going to come.

181
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:54,119
He was yelling on the phone.

182
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,633
Then why are you waiting?

183
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,699
Who's waiting?

184
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:02,326
I mean, I'm just curious about your boyfriend.

185
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:04,947
That's why I'm waiting.

186
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,299
Hey, who's that?

187
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,667
Are you Geum Jan Di?

188
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:16,852
Gu Jun Pyo?

189
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:22,465
What a coincidence!

190
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:24,761
A coincidence...?

191
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,516
I was just passing by,
and saw an old-fashioned girl like

192
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:38,416
you shivering in the cold,
so I called your name just in case.

193
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,759
Oh, really?

194
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,659
Then just go where you were going.

195
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,673
I was waiting for Ga Eul's boyfriend.

196
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:48,264
Why are you waiting for someone else's boyfriend?

197
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,616
Just go where you were going.

198
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:52,538
Don't scratch me.

199
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,501
I'm done with what I was doing.

200
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:58,977
Want me to stay with you?

201
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:01,275
What?

202
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:05,562
Do you want to be the third wheel
with another couple and cause them harm?

203
00:20:05,563 --> 00:20:07,401
Harm...?

204
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:10,271
I'm being nice!

205
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:11,396
I'll stay with you.

206
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:13,379
That's good, Jan Di.

207
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:18,185
For some reason, I have a bad feeling about this.

208
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:19,787
Why isn't he showing up?

209
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,818
He's already thirty minutes late.

210
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,114
His manner is...

211
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:26,328
Sorry, I'll try to call him.

212
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:30,240
Call him fast!

213
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,186
I lost money, and got ditched...

214
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:39,634
Gu Jun Pyo's just not a help in life.

215
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:44,250
Ah, it's cold.

216
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:47,349
If I knew it'd be like this, I would've just played squash.

217
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:52,488
How did you know that Gu Jun Pyo wouldn't come?

218
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:56,415
Today, I'm paying for everything.

219
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:02,596
<i>Hey!</i>

220
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,850
Why were you so late?

221
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:07,918
Hi!

222
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,004
Banga banga~

223
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,490
I'm Gong Su Pyo.

224
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:14,558
Hello, I'm Geum Jan Di, Ga Eul's friend.

225
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,755
And this is Gu Jun Pyo.

226
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:23,125
Wow, your hair!

227
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,809
What shop do you go to?

228
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,971
Your hair's just like a conch horn.

229
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,352
If I put this up on a blog, I think it'd be a great hit!

230
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:38,146
What?

231
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:39,859
Oppa...

232
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,139
Now that I look at it, Su Pyo, Jun Pyo.

233
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,883
It's like we're brothers!

234
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:45,542
Call me hyung.

235
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:48,940
Dongseng, let's be friends!

236
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:48,940
<i>{\a6}Dongseng means a younger brother or sister.</i>

237
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:58,883
What kind of guy is that?

238
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:04,351
He doesn't even say sorry that he's late
and what, a conch horn...?

239
00:22:04,352 --> 00:22:05,245
That kid!

240
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:07,099
Gu Jun Pyo!

241
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:09,858
Sorry...

242
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:12,999
Do you want to just... go?

243
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,299
We can just go if you want.

244
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,228
Let's just do that.

245
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:24,454
No, let's just try going on that...
commoners date, or whatever.

246
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,883
Do you want one?

247
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,163
Thank you.

248
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,362
Don't just get that from him!

249
00:23:35,077 --> 00:23:36,465
Hey, look at this!

250
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:54,156
What kind of place is this?

251
00:23:54,157 --> 00:23:57,607
Jun Pyo dongseng, is it the first time for you?

252
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,823
You never ate gopchang before?

253
00:23:59,824 --> 00:24:00,759
Gopchang?

254
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,254
A cow or pig's intestines!

255
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:04,997
Intestines?!

256
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,509
You don't know large intestine, small intestine?

257
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:12,137
What, Jun Pyo dongseng!

258
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:14,680
You're just a boaster?

259
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:17,574
Jan Di, I think you should think again.

260
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:21,769
How are you going to trust your life
with a guy who can't even eat gopchang?

261
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:23,650
What?

262
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,120
Oh, that looks good!

263
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,167
You guys should eat a lot.

264
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,604
You should try some.

265
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:33,624
If you chew well, then it's pretty good.

266
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,395
It looks like you can't eat this.

267
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,975
Don't go over your limits and just quit.

268
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:43,157
We can't eat it because we can't afford it!

269
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,768
Who says I'm not going to eat it?

270
00:25:04,655 --> 00:25:05,667
Are you okay?

271
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:07,092
What else can I be?

272
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:09,927
Are you really... okay?

273
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,923
I don't think so!

274
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:16,962
I'm warning you...

275
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:20,162
You better be careful.

276
00:25:20,163 --> 00:25:22,883
You don't know that a fly should be scared of a snake.

277
00:25:22,884 --> 00:25:23,519
What?

278
00:25:25,437 --> 00:25:26,918
Jun Pyo dongseng!

279
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,540
Do you mean that a one-day puppy
should be scared of a tiger?

280
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,954
Dongseng, you're so funny!

281
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:35,844
I heard you guys go to Shinhwa High School.

282
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:37,874
I guess you really do pay to get in there.

283
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:40,334
How much does it have to be, if you're like this?

284
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:45,235
Gu Jun Pyo...

285
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:57,188
It's so pretty.

286
00:26:58,436 --> 00:26:59,735
Do you like it?

287
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,659
Yeah.

288
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,834
It's my first time being at a place like this.

289
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:05,161
It feels like we're inside a fairy tale book.

290
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:11,353
Are you some Little Match Girl or something?

291
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:13,396
Why don't you have gloves on?

292
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:15,178
I do have gloves!

293
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,667
Come here.

294
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:42,401
Let's go together next time.

295
00:27:42,402 --> 00:27:43,426
Where?

296
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:46,000
Champs Elysees

297
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:01,834
Jun Pyo dongseng.

298
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:05,642
How about we get the girls a cup of warm coffee?

299
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:07,874
It's okay for me.

300
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:10,228
Let's go.

301
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:36,674
Oh, yeah.

302
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:37,984
Me?

303
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:41,023
I'm at the ice skating rink.

304
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,604
I'm sorry.

305
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:50,911
Because of Su Pyo oppa...

306
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:52,401
Oh, no.

307
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:55,352
It doesn't seem like he's a bad person.

308
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:59,778
Although it feels risky, I think we fulfilled our purpose.

309
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,571
Right?

310
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,602
Purpose?

311
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:05,939
Look at Jun Pyo sunbae,
trying his best to match up to you.

312
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,322
I was actually touched.

313
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:12,377
It does feel like he's trying.

314
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:16,200
Yeah, I feel like I can trust him now.

315
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,626
But why are they taking so long?

316
00:29:18,627 --> 00:29:19,789
Let's go find them.

317
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:30,687
Gu Jun Pyo!

318
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:31,890
Oppa!

319
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:35,212
What are you doing?

320
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:39,726
Why are you punching him?

321
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:40,769
What's wrong with you?!

322
00:29:40,954 --> 00:29:42,877
Do I need a reason to hit someone like him?

323
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:43,988
Hey!

324
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,191
You.

325
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:51,025
If you're going to find a guy, get someone right.

326
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:56,811
Don't you dare go like that!

327
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:02,861
Apologize.

328
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:09,560
If you just go like this, we're done.

329
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:10,866
Jan Di...

330
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:13,051
Apologize.

331
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:16,216
Hey!

332
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:18,105
Gu Jun Pyo!

333
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:19,614
Hey!

334
00:30:25,263 --> 00:30:26,466
What happened?

335
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:27,997
I don't know, either!

336
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:32,002
I said let's stay friends, and he just started punching me!

337
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,330
If he was going to say no, he could've just said it.

338
00:30:38,224 --> 00:30:40,282
This is definitely going to last eight weeks.

339
00:30:40,283 --> 00:30:41,985
I'm sorry.

340
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:44,984
I'll apologize in his place.

341
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:01,811
Can we get this and that?

342
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:38,431
I can't contact him.

343
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:41,093
And he just ignores my text messages.

344
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:44,773
I'm sorry, Ga Eul.

345
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,004
I really have nothing to say.

346
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:52,079
I'll tell Gu Jun Pyo...

347
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,567
No, I don't think Jun Pyo sunbae
would've done something like that without a reason.

348
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:58,833
What do you mean?

349
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:02,857
That day, oppa made a lot of mistakes,

350
00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:06,481
but Jun Pyo sunbae kept trying to keep his anger in.

351
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:08,620
There must have been a reason.

352
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:10,348
What reason?

353
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:14,300
Have you ever seen that kid act reasonably?

354
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,879
He always wants everything his way.

355
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,958
That kid, he'll do that and more.

356
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:22,279
Just wait.

357
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,589
What are you going to do?

358
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:27,906
I'm going to get it out of him.

359
00:32:27,907 --> 00:32:29,810
An apology.

360
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:37,754
Geum Jan Di.

361
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,452
What are you here for?

362
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:43,492
Please tell him that I’m here
because I have something to tell him.

363
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:46,159
He’s right next to you.

364
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,414
That’s what she said to deliver to you.

365
00:32:52,415 --> 00:32:54,728
Tell her that I don’t have anything to say,

366
00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:57,361
so she can do whatever she wants.

367
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:58,828
That’s what he said to deliver to you.

368
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:01,167
Would you please ask what country’s law it is

369
00:33:01,168 --> 00:33:04,255
to beat someone up for no reason and not apologize?

370
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,938
Hey. Did you do something big again?

371
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:09,532
She’s asking you what country’s law it is.

372
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:12,803
Tell her that it’s a waste
to even use your fist on that kind of guy.

373
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:14,508
He’s saying that it’s a waste.

374
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:17,705
Really… until when do I have to keep doing this?

375
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:20,541
Hey, what’s up with you guys?

376
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:26,628
Please deliver this very well to him
that this is my last warning.

377
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:31,313
Thanks to his high and almighty punch,
my friend is crying.

378
00:33:31,314 --> 00:33:34,726
That if he doesn’t apologize, then it’s really over.

379
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,876
She should be thanking me
for getting rid of a piece of trash for her,

380
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:40,059
but an apology?

381
00:33:40,373 --> 00:33:42,796
Tell her that I can’t do it even if I die,

382
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:44,413
so tell her to do what she wants.

383
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:45,583
Jun Pyo.

384
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:48,922
Alright, I understand Jun Pyo.

385
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:52,415
Hey, this suits you well.

386
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:57,345
It was a bit of a stretch for me to expect
that you would fit to someone’s tastes willingly.

387
00:33:57,346 --> 00:34:03,387
But I don’t understand why innocent Ga Eul
needs to face the consequences of your actions.

388
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:11,012
Gu Jun Pyo, don’t act like you know me from now on.

389
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:12,836
Geum Jan Di.

390
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:15,442
Hey, why are you guys like this?

391
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:17,346
I apologize.

392
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:19,312
Goodbye.

393
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,864
Hey, aren’t you going to go out?

394
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:26,162
You’re going to just let her go?

395
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:28,442
What’d you do this time?

396
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:53,306
See? I told you you’d get a cold.

397
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:13,368
How did you know?

398
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:16,376
You swim when you feel distressed.

399
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,717
Something distressful happened.

400
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:21,805
So… she’ll be at the swimming pool.

401
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:23,103
Is it that hard?

402
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:25,782
If you’re going to talk about Gu Jun Pyo,
I’m not going to talk about it.

403
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:27,579
Did I ever say that I was going to talk about Jun Pyo?

404
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,761
If he did something wrong to me,
then it’s done and over with after he yells at me once,

405
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,395
but because of Ga Eul, I can’t.

406
00:35:33,396 --> 00:35:35,961
She did it to try to help us.

407
00:35:35,962 --> 00:35:40,390
We’re talking about Jun Pyo right now, right?

408
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:42,583
Can you answer me?

409
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:47,501
Anyways! I can’t forgive him easily this time.

410
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:54,180
If things end for Ga Eul,
how can I go out with Gu Jun Pyo?

411
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:56,220
You said you weren’t going to talk about him,
but you keep doing it.

412
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:02,458
I was hoping that you wouldn't need it, but you would.

413
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:14,361
If you don’t dry your hair after you swim,
you’ll catch a cold.

414
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:20,043
Someone I know is doing that every single day these days.

415
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:21,555
So…

416
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,207
See?

417
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,592
Sunbae.

418
00:36:25,593 --> 00:36:27,963
Aren’t you thankful?

419
00:36:27,964 --> 00:36:30,453
Then I’ll just say one thing.

420
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:38,728
A guy doesn't do anything 'just'
in front of the girl that he likes.

421
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:43,290
There is always a reason.

422
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:44,889
Huh?

423
00:36:46,655 --> 00:36:49,091
I’m saying this out of experience,

424
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:51,852
so it’s okay if you believe it.

425
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,644
I’ll be going.

426
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,292
Come on.

427
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:22,613
Jan Di, I’m scared.

428
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:26,761
You’re just going to keep waiting for a guy
who hasn’t called you in several days?

429
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:28,571
Come on.

430
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:32,127
Didn’t you say that the club Kong Su Pyo
worked at was in this area?

431
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:33,625
Let’s go.

432
00:37:38,745 --> 00:37:40,697
Oppa.

433
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:49,123
You know the high school chick
that I was seeing for just fun?

434
00:37:49,124 --> 00:37:50,911
I went out on a double date with her,

435
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:53,221
And the guy who came out along with her
was a total plutocrat.

436
00:37:53,222 --> 00:37:53,970
<i>Plutocrat?</i>

437
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,716
<i>You should have introduced him to me.</i>

438
00:37:55,717 --> 00:37:57,920
<i>Hey, forget it.</i>

439
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:02,226
I think he has a lot of money,
but his taste in girls is terrible.

440
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:05,066
The girl didn’t look like a high schooler
and had the body of an elementary student.

441
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,737
<i>Do you know how shabby they looked too?</i>

442
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:09,499
They’re both waitresses.

443
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,452
<i>Waitresses? Which club?</i>

444
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:14,352
Not that, they work part time at a porridge shop.

445
00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:15,289
What?

446
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:18,075
But her girlfriend is a plutocrat?

447
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:19,560
Is she that pretty?

448
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,179
Pretty my ass.

449
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,001
So when I told him that I’d introduce him to a hot girl like you,

450
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,686
he threw a fist out of nowhere.

451
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,827
Oh, hey.

452
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:38,046
Me?

453
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:40,277
I’m at the skating rink.

454
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:42,696
What do you mean, why?

455
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:46,631
I’m a little busy playing with a couple of tacky kids.

456
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:49,484
What?

457
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:51,167
Really?

458
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,754
Okay, I got it.

459
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:54,084
Wait for me.

460
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:02,466
<i>Jun Pyo dongseng.</i>

461
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:05,690
Let’s talk about this truthfully as guys.

462
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,732
That Jan Di or Jab Cho?

463
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,732
<i>{\a6}Jab Cho means weed</i>

464
00:39:07,733 --> 00:39:09,934
Isn’t she not the girl?

465
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:12,940
Is she blackmailing you or something?

466
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,175
What?

467
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:17,127
Maybe Miss Weed has a bit of money?

468
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:19,920
Seeing you, I think you’re more at loss.

469
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:22,227
What are you talking about?

470
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:26,115
Why don’t we finish things up here and go to a club?

471
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:30,115
If we go there, we can meet hot chicks
that don’t even compare those reeking…

472
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:33,395
What’s up with you?

473
00:39:41,132 --> 00:39:43,704
If you call my girlfriend Jab Cho,

474
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:46,419
I'll make sure that you won't be able to eat intestines
with that mouth ever again.

475
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,449
Got it?

476
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:57,877
Is what you said right now true, Kong Su Pyo?

477
00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:59,246
You guys…

478
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:02,081
I’m asking you if it’s true.

479
00:40:02,082 --> 00:40:03,985
What are you going to do if it’s true?

480
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,887
Oppa, who are they?

481
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,654
Do you know them?

482
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,587
Do you think I’d know them at my level?

483
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,163
Oppa…

484
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:16,329
What is the reason why you didn’t contact Ga Eul?

485
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:18,764
Reason?

486
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,798
Do you guys always have to get hit

487
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:26,105
in order to know whether something is poop or bean paste?

488
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:28,008
This works out well.

489
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,147
Hey, tacky girl.

490
00:40:29,148 --> 00:40:30,942
Send those texts reasonably.

491
00:40:30,943 --> 00:40:32,752
Are you a stalker?

492
00:40:32,753 --> 00:40:35,451
Because of you, my inbox is full that it’s a nuisance.

493
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:36,213
Hey!

494
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:57,279
You!

495
00:40:58,011 --> 00:40:59,883
One is for Ga Eul,

496
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:02,587
and the other is for my boyfriend.

497
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:07,371
If you ever appear in front of Ga Eul, you’re dead.

498
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:08,975
Understand?

499
00:41:09,913 --> 00:41:11,036
What are you?

500
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:12,471
Go home!

501
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,285
What kind of guy is that?

502
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:26,093
But it’s a relief.

503
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:33,615
You found out that Jun Pyo sunbae isn’t a bad person.

504
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:36,518
Ga Eul.

505
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:38,546
I’m okay.

506
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:39,955
Really.

507
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:43,213
Jan Di, go ahead.

508
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:44,912
Where?

509
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:47,721
You have to go apologize to Jun Pyo sunbae.

510
00:41:48,584 --> 00:41:50,987
That… just…

511
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,460
Tell him you’re sorry quickly.

512
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:57,408
That way, I think I’ll feel at rest too.

513
00:41:57,705 --> 00:42:00,278
You’ll be fine by yourself?

514
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:01,729
Of course.

515
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,569
Don’t worry about me.

516
00:42:04,507 --> 00:42:05,754
Go quickly.

517
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:08,145
I’ll call you.

518
00:42:35,396 --> 00:42:38,263
I’m begging you to give up now. Please.

519
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:43,505
That threat about you taking medication…

520
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:43,505
<i>{\a6}Meaning committing suicide</i>

521
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:46,457
Am I next after father?

522
00:44:15,216 --> 00:44:17,397
Your lips...

523
00:44:26,651 --> 00:44:28,709
Your lipstick smudged.

524
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,349
Thank you.

525
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:36,601
You’re the fourth.

526
00:44:36,602 --> 00:44:37,818
Excuse me?

527
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:40,411
You’re his fourth girlfriend this year.

528
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:50,805
I think you’re too beautiful to be that.

529
00:46:14,612 --> 00:46:16,248
Stop the car.

530
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:26,573
Aren’t you past the age to cry in the middle of the street?

531
00:46:30,335 --> 00:46:35,675
Some women are mistaken
when they think they look pretty when they cry.

532
00:46:35,676 --> 00:46:38,710
But it’s really not true.

533
00:46:46,842 --> 00:46:48,526
Miss Ga Eul.

534
00:46:53,207 --> 00:46:54,871
Miss Ga Eul.

535
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:03,502
It’s not me.

536
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:07,320
It’s not me.

537
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:09,350
Miss Ga Eul!

538
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,236
Miss Ga Eul!

539
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:15,892
Miss Ga Eul!

540
00:47:21,693 --> 00:47:22,813
Two pairs.

541
00:47:22,814 --> 00:47:24,106
Really?

542
00:47:24,552 --> 00:47:25,947
What is this?

543
00:47:25,948 --> 00:47:28,537
Nothing’s working out for me.

544
00:47:32,873 --> 00:47:34,404
You didn’t settle things with Jan Di yet?

545
00:47:34,405 --> 00:47:35,914
Settle?

546
00:47:35,915 --> 00:47:38,333
See if blink even one eye

547
00:47:38,334 --> 00:47:39,986
even if she begs at my feet for four days and three nights.

548
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:41,999
Let’s just hear what happened.

549
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,419
I don’t think you did anything right either.

550
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,497
What do you mean I didn’t do anything right?

551
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:47,475
I went out on a double or triple with them,

552
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:49,581
I ate intestines or gopchang with them,

553
00:47:49,582 --> 00:47:52,138
I even exterminated a guy as harmful as rice insect.

554
00:47:52,862 --> 00:47:54,234
All I did were good deeds.

555
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,729
Then you won’t be meeting with Geum Jan Di either, then.

556
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:59,944
So I’m saying that I won’t overlook it easily this time.

557
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,904
I don’t think it’ll work, Geum Jan Di.

558
00:48:01,905 --> 00:48:04,031
I think you’ll just have to leave.

559
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,611
Hey.

560
00:48:11,673 --> 00:48:14,044
When did you get here?

561
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:17,682
I didn’t know that you were that mad.

562
00:48:17,683 --> 00:48:20,815
I think I only thought about myself.

563
00:48:21,323 --> 00:48:22,499
Sorry.

564
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:24,496
I’ll be going.

565
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:28,678
Where are you going?

566
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,515
If you came, you have to at least tell me why you’re here.

567
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:37,931
You think this place is a place
where you can just come and go as you wish?

568
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:41,686
Gu Jun Pyo.

569
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:52,329
Please accept my apology.

570
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:52,329
<i>{\a6}Apple and apology in hangul sound the same.</i>

571
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:04,704
If everything is relieved just with an apology,

572
00:49:04,705 --> 00:49:05,556
then why are there laws…

573
00:49:05,557 --> 00:49:07,850
and why are there police.

574
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:09,774
You know very well.

575
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:12,436
So what do you want me to do?

576
00:49:13,437 --> 00:49:15,247
Three wishes.

577
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:17,011
Three wishes?

578
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:18,895
If you do them for me, then I’ll accept it.

579
00:49:18,896 --> 00:49:20,757
Why three-

580
00:49:21,955 --> 00:49:24,315
Why do you have three wishes?

581
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:27,190
Hey guys.

582
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:29,617
Don’t you think she’s big at fault because

583
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:32,466
she can’t even see Gu Jun Pyo’s good intentions?

584
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:34,088
Pretty big.

585
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:39,361
Alright. I’ll do whatever you ask me to do.

586
00:49:39,594 --> 00:49:43,028
Instead, you have to tell me all three of them in one minute.

587
00:49:43,029 --> 00:49:44,155
Start!

588
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:46,346
What kind of rule is that?

589
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:48,110
It’s right here. What do you mean, "what"?

590
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:49,457
<i>10, 11, 12, 13,</i>

591
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:51,933
-14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
- Hey, stop that!

592
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:52,563
19. 20.

593
00:49:52,564 --> 00:49:53,249
<i>Stop!</i>

594
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:53,903
<i>21.</i>

595
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:54,504
<i>25.</i>

596
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,015
Sit down for now.

597
00:49:55,016 --> 00:49:55,733
26.

598
00:49:55,734 --> 00:49:56,431
27.

599
00:49:56,432 --> 00:49:57,239
Stop!

600
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,800
<i>28, 29, 30.</i>

601
00:49:58,801 --> 00:49:59,579
Stand up.

602
00:49:59,709 --> 00:50:01,051
Hey, you have one wish left.

603
00:50:01,052 --> 00:50:01,999
<i>50!</i>

604
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:02,833
51.

605
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,209
<i>52, 53.</i>

606
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,146
54, 55.

607
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:06,502
Stop!

608
00:50:08,499 --> 00:50:15,360
Say, "Oppa... I’m sowwy."

609
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:21,324
<i>Didn’t you hear me?</i>

610
00:50:21,325 --> 00:50:25,123
"Oppa! I’m sowwy."

611
00:50:25,124 --> 00:50:26,679
Try it.

612
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:32,859
Gu Jun Pyo.

613
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,732
Hey, didn’t you see Ga Eul doing it?

614
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:38,394
Now, repeat after me.

615
00:50:40,008 --> 00:50:43,530
"Oppa, I’m sowwy."

616
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:54,860
I can’t do it!

617
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:56,001
I won’t do it!

618
00:50:56,002 --> 00:50:57,905
You do what you want. Accept it or don’t.

619
00:50:57,906 --> 00:50:59,216
I can’t do it.

620
00:51:00,776 --> 00:51:02,768
<i>Hey, Geum Jan Di!</i>

621
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:04,159
<i>Where are you going?!</i>

622
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,583
You should’ve accepted her apology when she did.

623
00:51:07,224 --> 00:51:08,459
Give it to me.

624
00:51:09,106 --> 00:51:10,054
Give it to me.

625
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,752
Hey!

626
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:15,332
Why are you eating this!

627
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:18,804
I accepted an apology.

628
00:51:39,148 --> 00:51:42,611
That rascal looks a pretty weak, right?

629
00:52:05,627 --> 00:52:08,227
It’s stronger than it looks.

630
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:14,452
How long do you think it took to make him strong like this?

631
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:19,864
It got rolled, stepped on, and cut on.

632
00:52:19,865 --> 00:52:23,640
It has to endure a heat of 1300 degrees.

633
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,698
But that’s not the end of it.

634
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:29,254
If it doesn’t become yours even after all of that hardship,

635
00:52:29,255 --> 00:52:31,438
then you have to give up on it cleanly.

636
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,612
Like this.

637
00:53:08,399 --> 00:53:10,552
In order to get stronger,

638
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:13,156
and in order to find something that is truly yours,

639
00:53:13,157 --> 00:53:15,804
I’m saying that there are steps that you must pass.

640
00:53:15,805 --> 00:53:19,459
Like what you experienced today.

641
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:27,038
I think I know what you’re talking about.

642
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:29,875
Thank you.

643
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:34,740
Then shall we start going out?

644
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:37,164
Where?

645
00:53:37,445 --> 00:53:39,969
I’m not having that much of a great diagnosis either.

646
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,725
In these types of cases,
you need to relieve it so there are no side symptoms.

647
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:45,149
Let’s go.

648
00:56:19,136 --> 00:56:20,480
Who is that guy?

649
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:22,615
Oh my. It’s So Yi Jung.

650
00:56:23,067 --> 00:56:26,248
F4 doesn’t come to places like this.
What’s the occasion?

651
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,293
He’s really glowing in real life.

652
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,662
F4?

653
00:56:31,165 --> 00:56:32,489
What is that?

654
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,983
Haven’t you even heard of the pretty boy prince group F4?

655
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,202
Excuse me…

656
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:47,609
Me?

657
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,960
Yes, please talk.

658
00:56:50,496 --> 00:56:52,550
May I play a song?

659
00:56:52,551 --> 00:56:53,703
Play?

660
00:56:53,704 --> 00:56:54,940
Please head on up.

661
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:57,449
You can play all night long if you wish.

662
00:56:58,103 --> 00:56:59,666
Thank you.

663
00:57:45,248 --> 00:57:49,490
There is someone who has taken away
my whole heart here tonight.

664
00:57:56,713 --> 00:57:59,785
I’ll play my heart for that person.

665
00:59:29,383 --> 00:59:31,484
I apologized enough already.

666
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:34,522
Why did he chase me all the way home and call me out?

667
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:36,257
That Gu Jun Pyo.

668
00:59:39,112 --> 00:59:40,604
Gu Jun Pyo.

669
00:59:40,605 --> 00:59:45,557
You think I’ll be like,
"Oppa, I’m sowwy" even after this?

670
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:46,850
Why would I…

671
01:00:05,145 --> 01:00:06,328
You…

672
01:00:06,329 --> 01:00:07,406
Again, again.

673
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:10,434
You get moved by such trivial things.

674
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:24,738
Gu Jun Pyo.

675
01:00:30,432 --> 01:00:33,114
How’d you do all this?

676
01:00:33,733 --> 01:00:37,626
I just decorated it using chandelier decorations.

677
01:00:38,314 --> 01:00:39,323
Do you like it?

678
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:40,197
Yeah.

679
01:00:40,198 --> 01:00:41,574
It’s pretty.

680
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:45,923
It’s really pretty.

681
01:00:47,282 --> 01:00:49,464
It’s like Christmas.

682
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:51,899
What’s so good about Christmas?

683
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,050
You don’t like Christmas?

684
01:00:54,924 --> 01:00:57,501
You feel happy just by thinking about it.

685
01:00:58,827 --> 01:01:03,785
I don’t have any memories liking Christmas.

686
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:05,475
Why?

687
01:01:08,205 --> 01:01:08,936
<i>Look out the window,</i>

688
01:01:08,937 --> 01:01:10,520
<i>Look out the window,</i>

689
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:13,557
<i>White snow is falling.</i>

690
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:15,765
<i>Look out the window,</i>

691
01:01:15,766 --> 01:01:17,117
<i>Look out the window,</i>

692
01:01:17,118 --> 01:01:20,128
<i>Winter has come.</i>

693
01:01:20,534 --> 01:01:23,734
<i>Little children riding sleds</i>

694
01:01:23,735 --> 01:01:26,882
<i>don’t know that the sun is setting,</i>

695
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:33,266
<i>and they ride their sleds excitedly on the snowy hills.</i>

696
01:01:33,904 --> 01:01:36,871
<i>The long long sunset</i>

697
01:01:36,872 --> 01:01:40,038
<i>When the darkness comes,</i>

698
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:43,671
<i>Colorful and gilttering</i>

699
01:01:43,672 --> 01:01:46,617
<i>Streets are full of Christmas spirit</i>

700
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:53,934
I see.

701
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:59,476
Hey, Geum Jan Di.

702
01:02:01,204 --> 01:02:04,374
Did the Kim Jang that I made ripen?

703
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:08,709
If someone hears, they’d probably think
that you made all of our Kim Jang.

704
01:02:10,597 --> 01:02:12,685
I want to eat it.

705
01:02:12,686 --> 01:02:13,979
Really?

706
01:02:14,249 --> 01:02:15,262
Yeah.

707
01:02:16,189 --> 01:02:21,779
I want to eat the fish that your mom picks out for me too.

708
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:28,610
The oden that your dad bought me was really good too.

709
01:02:31,888 --> 01:02:34,101
I…

710
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:40,796
didn’t know what a family was,

711
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:44,685
but seeing your family,

712
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:48,533
I think I understand a little now.

713
01:02:50,302 --> 01:02:52,433
Can I go over again?

714
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,370
Did you ever ask permission in the past?

715
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:58,161
I’m not joking.

716
01:03:13,682 --> 01:03:15,730
I want to go.

717
01:03:17,957 --> 01:03:21,606
In actuality...

718
01:03:21,606 --> 01:03:23,706
every day.
