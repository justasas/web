Episode 11

4
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:17,703
Hello.

5
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:28,346
He..hello.

6
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:36,826
Is anybody here?

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,781
What are all these?

8
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,359
They smell great right?

9
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:56,294
It’s very good for the skin.

10
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:59,862
Because of Geum Jan Di,
even the pool gets a special treatment.

11
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:02,727
But how long will it take to finish all these?

12
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:05,177
Wouldn’t it be faster just to fill it with hot spring water?

13
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:07,157
Why didn’t I think of it?

14
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:12,594
But for a guy preparing to surprise his girlfriend,
Why do you look so somber?

15
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:14,150
It's only these...

16
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,011
It's all I can do for her.

17
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,679
It's frustrating.

18
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,359
Very good.

19
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:51,941
Very good.

20
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:59,081
By the way, is it alright to take pictures like this?

21
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:00,541
It’s okay.

22
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:03,270
Very good. Very good.

23
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:08,374
Looking sexy is the current trend.

24
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,003
As innocent as a high school student,

25
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:13,880
and this cute image really suits you!

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,971
It’s really good.

27
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:19,061
I am a high school student.

28
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:21,403
Ah. Yes, a high school student.

29
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,866
You said that you go to Shinhwa High right?

30
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,346
But isn’t that a school for rich kids?

31
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:30,984
Isn’t the economy in a recession now?

32
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,979
It’s hard isn't it?

33
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,451
But don’t worry.
This industry does not get affected by it.

34
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,597
No.

35
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:41,326
It actually does better in a recession.

36
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,690
That’s right, Representative. That’s right.

37
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:45,590
Really.

38
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:49,880
Let’s shoot the next series.

39
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:52,054
Next series. Okay.

40
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,772
Next series?

41
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:57,690
Yes.

42
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,050
Hey, I’m sorry.

43
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,220
But I can’t wear this.

44
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,250
Don’t be shy. Come out.

45
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,880
We said it’s alright already.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,750
You people, really...
Are you really shooting for a Hagwon Academy brochure?

47
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,125
Who would wear this kind of clothing?

48
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,416
Don't be like that.

49
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,410
What's going on?

50
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:41,424
If you started something, then you have to finish it.

51
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:44,100
What's going on here?!

52
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:47,384
You crazy freaks!

53
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,755
Don’t come near me!

54
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:54,186
This girl is feisty.

55
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,047
Get away from me.

56
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:00,893
I’m dangerous you understand?!
I'll kill you!

57
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:23,848
Let's go, quickly!

58
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:38,455
Uh, your name is?

59
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,000
Forget about it today.

60
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:42,920
Huh?

61
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:46,422
We will meet soon again.

62
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:48,167
What?

63
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:51,032
When we meet again, I will tell you.

64
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:54,300
Good night, Miss Geum Jan Di.

65
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,045
Goodbye.

66
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:57,973
Miss Geum Jan Di?

67
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,600
How...

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,400
Miss Geum Jan Di?

69
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:15,845
Really?

70
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,663
That means he knew you.

71
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,533
That’s right.

72
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:22,745
Either way, that's pretty cool.

73
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:24,181
What?

74
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:27,350
He is like the genuine Black Knight.

75
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,251
My Ha Je is out!

76
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:33,440
Doesn't he look awesome?

77
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,737
It was only the other day,
you're saying the Prince of Andromeda was the best.

78
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:38,830
You've got no loyalty.

79
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,167
Ha Je?

80
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,571
Jan Di, don't you know?

81
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,250
He is the most sought after model today.

82
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:50,060
His birth is a secret, surname unknown,
and a hidden private life.

83
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:53,626
He's a mysterious hot model.

84
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:57,797
Every magazine, with him on the cover,
would sell out within the day.

85
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:02,879
I went through a lot to get this limited edition bottle.

86
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:04,557
Great, isn't it?

87
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,289
So moist.

88
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,017
Ah, I'm so hungry!

89
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:22,302
I get hungrier doing nothing.

90
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,619
I should go nap at the swimming complex.

91
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,438
The noodles are done.

92
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,591
How can you just leave it like this!

93
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:17,438
The noodles will get soggy.

94
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:18,000
You... You...

95
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,818
Let me introduce myself,
Geum Jan Di sunbae-nim.

96
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,236
Sunbae?

97
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:29,284
My name is Lee Je Ha, Shinhwa High 1st year.

98
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:30,809
Oh.

99
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:35,353
Actually, I have always been a fan of yours.

100
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,490
Fan?

101
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,168
The Joan d'Arc of Shinhwa High.

102
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:40,642
You are the commoner’s hero who stood up to F4.

103
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,069
I am not considered a commoner’s hero.

104
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:48,780
But dressed like this, I can’t recognize you.

105
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:50,130
It’s a concept.

106
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:51,028
Concept?

107
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,912
Non-star concept.

108
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:55,640
Star?

109
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,815
Honestly, I hate all the students here.

110
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,880
And I don't want any of them as a friend either.

111
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,053
My goal is not to attract attention.

112
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:04,399
And to last till I graduate.

113
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,040
You can say it’s a concept to isolate myself.

114
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,968
- Why are you laughing?
- Because you are like me.

115
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:15,430
You think!?
I thought so too.

116
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,212
I always believe,

117
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:20,597
you and I are from the same world.

118
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,275
The same world?

119
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:32,639
I ate your ramen.

120
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,105
Hello Sunbae.

121
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:42,602
Hello Sunbae.

122
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,070
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

123
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:53,139
Get lost.

124
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,251
Thank you. Thank you.

125
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,122
<i>I'll help you get a part-time job.</i>

126
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:24,996
<i>It's an assistant position at a photo studio.</i>

127
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,853
<i>The pay is pretty good.</i>

128
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:52,744
It’s hard trying to get to see you.

129
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,570
Gu Jun Pyo.

130
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,080
Get in.

131
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:03,315
To eat crab in Hokkaido?

132
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,957
Why must we go to Japan to eat crabs?

133
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:08,306
Isn’t it the weekend?

134
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:09,775
We can enjoy the winter scenery.

135
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,961
If you don't want crab,
we can go to Sapporo for udon or ramen.

136
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:15,305
Go to Sapporo, just to eat ramen?

137
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:15,929
Let’s go.

138
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:18,495
- I'll call your parents on the way.
- Hey! No!

139
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:20,411
Why do you always say no?

140
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:21,981
Yes! Just say yes!

141
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,491
Why can't you ever just follow obediently for once?

142
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,919
I...already have plan.

143
00:11:30,294 --> 00:11:31,329
What plan?

144
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:35,075
Today is Ga Eul’s birthday!

145
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:36,270
What?

146
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:39,421
So I'm spending the night at Ga Eul’s place.

147
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,082
This is an important event,
and it is our long standing tradition for many years.

148
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,261
You give in okay.

149
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:45,290
Am I more important or Ga Eul is?

150
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,155
Ga Eul.

151
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:52,345
I'll call you.

152
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,594
Hey!

153
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,250
Not even glancing back.

154
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,917
Yi Jung?

155
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:21,964
Got it.

156
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:57,577
Happy Birthday.

157
00:13:57,697 --> 00:14:00,300
I heard it's your birthday today.

158
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,140
Huh?

159
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:06,612
You're here?

160
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,861
Oh, you're here. Hello.

161
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:10,148
Oh, you're here?

162
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:12,029
- Oh, Je Ha is here.
- Hello.

163
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:13,708
- You're here already?
- Hello.

164
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,399
Everyone seems to know you.

165
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:20,261
I've been working here for a long time.

166
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:22,437
You're next. Get prepared.

167
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:23,160
Okay.

168
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,704
Oh, Noona!
She is the one I mentioned to you on the phone...

169
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:27,456
Ah, your Sunbae?

170
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,196
Hello.

171
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:30,798
Please follow me.

172
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,518
- Then I’ll see you later.
- Don't worry, just go.

173
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,227
It’s a mess isn't it?

174
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:47,640
Please clean up and put everything back in order.

175
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:48,684
Yes.

176
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:52,659
Please work hard!

177
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,553
Wow. It’s Ha Je.

178
00:15:26,673 --> 00:15:27,939
You look great!

179
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:29,531
Ha Je oppa always look amazing!

180
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:30,829
Looking fabulous in any style!

181
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,351
- Wow, so handsome!
- Check out Ha Je!

182
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,391
You're so good looking!

183
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:38,029
How do I look?

184
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,225
What's going on?

185
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,747
Were you surprise?

186
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,344
Yes.

187
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:57,874
Unbelievable.

188
00:15:58,663 --> 00:16:01,350
Ha Je, shooting has started. So hurry.

189
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,783
I'll see you later.

190
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,949
Hyung, take a picture of us.

191
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:45,032
Wow, that's not bad.

192
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:48,736
Who's this young lady?

193
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:50,500
My girlfriend.

194
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,250
Hey!

195
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:53,169
No.

196
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,723
Miss, would you be interested doing some modeling?

197
00:17:58,957 --> 00:17:59,796
What?

198
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:01,729
Me?

199
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,945
Why not? We're shooting that concept
layout for the magazine next month.

200
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:06,914
Resembling a movie or drama.

201
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:10,641
We still haven't found your female partner yet.

202
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,491
Hey, the feel is just right.

203
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:15,600
Let's go for it, Sunbae.

204
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,789
How can I?

205
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:23,749
Really that much?

206
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,274
A person like me will look okay?

207
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:34,205
Of course. No problem!

208
00:20:05,614 --> 00:20:07,593
Can you understand her?

209
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,792
Did she have an ancestor who died during dating?

210
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:13,294
She runs off whenever the subject of dating comes up.

211
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,170
Weekdays, she needs to work, and
weekends, celebrating her friend's birthday.

212
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,029
She sure comes up with a lot of excuses.

213
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,380
Do you know how many jobs she has?

214
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:23,663
Delivering milk, delivering papers...

215
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:25,841
It's not like she's in a delivery contest or something.

216
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:29,061
I just wanted her to rest for a while.

217
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:33,303
She even said her friend is more important than her boyfriend.

218
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:48,492
Yummy!

219
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,070
It's my treat, so do eat a lot.

220
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:03,850
What?

221
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:08,040
I was thinking, my hyung would like this.

222
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,645
Je Ha you have a hyung?

223
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:12,009
Yes.

224
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:14,065
Speaking of which,

225
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:17,246
you're the type of girl my hyung would like.

226
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:19,642
So that’s why I like to get to know you better.

227
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:23,256
Is your hyung an undergraduate?

228
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,460
No.

229
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:30,664
He is in ill health, so he is convalescing now.

230
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:40,050
Looks like you're really close to your hyung.

231
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,848
He is the only family I have left.

232
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:52,481
Oh, no!

233
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,339
What's wrong?

234
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm late!

235
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,195
Deliveries!

236
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,934
Quickly, quickly!

237
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,141
Let’s go.

238
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:27,262
A poor lady became the mistress of a wealthy lawyer,

239
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,807
And gave birth to his sons.

240
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:32,630
A plot ending that everyone can guess.

241
00:23:36,094 --> 00:23:38,309
No need to look at me with pity.

242
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:42,093
Thanks to that, I didn’t grow up to be
a materialistic snob from high society.

243
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:44,122
I'm very thankful.

244
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,200
Wow, you're really touched!

245
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:53,134
Women always fall for this story.

246
00:23:59,010 --> 00:23:59,968
Hey!

247
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:02,745
You!

248
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,238
This dude is really...

249
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:07,416
Hey!

250
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,950
Not that side, it's this side.

251
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:11,969
That side? Ah, this side.

252
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:13,482
That side, that side. The house on that side.

253
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:14,538
That side.

254
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:17,240
This side, that side.

255
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:31,773
Sunbae!

256
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,284
You're Yoon Ji Hoo sunbae right? I am...

257
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:35,500
Are you okay?

258
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,379
Yes.

259
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:43,184
Jun Pyo came over last night.

260
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:47,721
He was sad for being pass over for Ga Eul.

261
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:51,167
Ah, that is...

262
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,249
Today,

263
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,545
I'll pretend that I didn't see you both.

264
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,733
Jun Pyo is quieter these days.

265
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:26,949
What?

266
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:28,211
Geum Jan Di.

267
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:32,000
About not seeing her, can't get a date.
You were complaining a lot.

268
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,021
I'm changing my strategy.

269
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:34,900
How so?

270
00:25:34,994 --> 00:25:39,516
I will play hard to get, and make her feel anxious.

271
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,257
Who believes this is will work?

272
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:48,613
Who doesn't?

273
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:51,079
You guys!

274
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:55,713
What is this? This is not your style.

275
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:58,830
This?

276
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,465
There's a little tacky.

277
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:03,048
But it is really warm.

278
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:07,129
Jun Pyo, thanks to you,
I was so embarrassed with Ga Eul.

279
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,477
What did I do?

280
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:18,717
Tall. Hot bod. Handsome.
What an eye candy!

281
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,747
Is she crazy?

282
00:26:56,469 --> 00:26:57,853
That bitch!

283
00:26:57,973 --> 00:26:59,115
With our beloved Ha Je...

284
00:26:59,194 --> 00:26:59,730
Unbelievable!

285
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:02,100
Bitch! She'd better watch out!

286
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,471
Low life!

287
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:05,845
How could a girl like that be a model!

288
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:08,749
- What a pisser!
- I won’t let her get away with it.

289
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:14,915
Wait till Geum Jan Di is here, I’ll show her.

290
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,872
- Ah! I'm so pissed!
- Our Ha Je...

291
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:22,970
Geum Jan Di, you’re so dead!

292
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:29,845
Geum Jan Di!

293
00:27:30,154 --> 00:27:33,666
I am so sick of you already!

294
00:27:33,905 --> 00:27:36,915
Jun Pyo and Ji Hoo sunbae, and now Ha Je!

295
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:39,538
How in the hell did you get to know Ha Je?

296
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:41,866
After you stole F4 away from us,

297
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:45,670
Ha Je was our only hope during our suffering.

298
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,545
- Why does it have to be Ha Je?
- With a low life like you!

299
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:55,482
I really don't care about giving you gals hope.

300
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,500
Ha Je!

301
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,750
Sunbae, let’s go.

302
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,278
NO WAY!

303
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:26,830
Gu Jun Pyo sunbae.

304
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:29,300
What's with all the commotion?

305
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:33,180
Sunbae, have you seen this?

306
00:28:34,037 --> 00:28:35,270
What's that?

307
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:50,235
Is this really Geum Jan Di?

308
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:50,993
Yes.

309
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:02,860
Get out of my way!

310
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:12,957
Get away from that hand.

311
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:15,768
Gu Jun Pyo.

312
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,399
Do it NOW!

313
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:25,330
Not only were you taking those worthless pictures,

314
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,326
but you've been avoiding me to be with trash like him?

315
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,458
Gu Jun Pyo, it's not like that.

316
00:29:31,524 --> 00:29:33,710
Geum Jan Di, you've grown a lot.

317
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:35,032
What?

318
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:38,918
Now that you're on a magazine cover,
you think your some kind of hot model?

319
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:41,125
Tell me.

320
00:29:41,643 --> 00:29:45,116
The reason you couldn't go with me to Hokkaido,
was it because you're doing this with him?

321
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:49,231
What?

322
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:52,380
Why don’t you insist that he’s Ga Eul?

323
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:56,400
Or was it his birthday that day?

324
00:29:56,453 --> 00:29:58,418
I’m sorry for lying.

325
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:00,178
I was wrong.

326
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:02,996
I can explain everything.

327
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:04,189
It’s...

328
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:10,900
Did you just laugh?

329
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:13,766
It's kind of funny.

330
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:17,936
Do you have so little confidence in the girl you like?

331
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,720
And before getting jealous,

332
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:26,250
shouldn’t you first try to
understand your girlfriend’s situation?

333
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:39,975
Get up.

334
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,720
Say it again!

335
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,400
What did you say?

336
00:30:57,685 --> 00:30:59,590
What do you know to talk like that?!

337
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,064
It's a shame.

338
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:02,459
What?

339
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,319
I'm saying Jan Di sunbae is wasted
on the likes of you.

340
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,509
This punk must be crazy!

341
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,687
Stop!

342
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,846
Stop it.

343
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,387
Please.

344
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,401
He helped me outside of school.

345
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:38,392
And at school, he's the only friend
I feel connected with.

346
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,388
The only one?

347
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:49,190
Say that again.

348
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:51,560
What does that jerk mean to you?

349
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,270
I can't breathe.

350
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:54,635
Say it.

351
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,300
It's hard for me.

352
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:00,833
I want...

353
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:03,997
I want to stop it now.

354
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:06,610
Hey Geum Jan Di!

355
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,191
F4 and Gu Jun Pyo,

356
00:32:11,403 --> 00:32:13,316
I want to go back to before I knew about you.

357
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:47,715
It’s up! It’s up!

358
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,784
Geum Jan Di, the red card!

359
00:35:49,904 --> 00:35:53,269
This is the first time anyone’s getting it twice.

360
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:02,554
Don’t worry about it.

361
00:36:04,232 --> 00:36:07,412
From now on, I’ll protect you.

362
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,857
It’s Geum Jan Di.

363
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,140
There's no desk.

364
00:36:48,524 --> 00:36:50,859
Your desk must have disappeared.

365
00:36:51,082 --> 00:36:53,382
Your chair is gone too.

366
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:00,835
Goodbye, Geum Jan Di

367
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,076

Look up there!

00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:49,546
That’s outside the F4 private classroom!

372
00:37:57,229 --> 00:37:59,928
Gu Jun Pyo wouldn’t do that.

373
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,867
He’s the one putting up the second red card.

374
00:38:03,128 --> 00:38:07,411
Gu Jun Pyo is the type that
would do this without a qualm.

375
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:12,354
No.

It's not true.

377

Since I’ve known Jun Pyo.

383
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,010
Really.

384
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:05,479
I don’t think anyone can
know someone completely.

385
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:13,032
But I believe that I know
what kind of person he is.

Do you think Jun Pyo is behind it all?

387
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:28,616
I want to believe in him too.

388
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:37,536
It’s up to you to decide
if you believe in him or not.

389
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:38,810
But.

390
00:40:43,095 --> 00:40:45,441
I let you go because it was him.

391
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,959
I didn’t pursue you because it was Jun Pyo.

01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:39,302
Take a good look at me.

550
01:01:40,912 --> 01:01:45,225
Don’t I remind you of someone?

558
01:02:20,743 --> 01:02:21,548
I told you I am not going!

559
01:02:21,549 --> 01:02:25,299
<i>Then do you really mean to date my Jun-pyo?!</i>

560
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:29,004
I think that's between the two of us,
Jun Pyo and I.

561
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:32,103
This is me and inside, this is you.

562
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:38,493
Because Jun Pyo the Star
won’t ever leave Jan Di the Moon.

563
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:39,510
Let’s go.

564
01:02:39,528 --> 01:02:41,390
- Where?
- What do you mean where?

565
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:42,619
Skiing of course!

566
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,560
Ga Eul! Watch out!

567
01:02:45,564 --> 01:02:47,329
Ga Eul! Are you okay?

568
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:48,540
Wake up!

569
01:02:48,877 --> 01:02:51,610
I’m really sorry.
I was definitely wearing it around my neck.

570
01:02:51,725 --> 01:02:53,581
You do this every time.

571
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:58,919
Whenever I try to get closer,
you trample on my heart like it’s nothing.

572
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:01,600
We've a problem! Jan Di is out on the slope...

573
01:03:01,665 --> 01:03:03,105
Where’s Jun Pyo?

574
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:06,372
Young Master, we're ready to leave.
