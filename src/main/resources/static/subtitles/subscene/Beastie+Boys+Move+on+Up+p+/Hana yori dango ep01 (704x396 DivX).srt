00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,167
Boys Before Flowers

00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:08,333
Episode 1

3
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,583
Why?

4
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:24,375
Why?

5
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,458
Why is this so?

6
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:42,625
Why are so many things branded in school?

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,665
Why Franck Muller? Why Louis Vuitton?

8
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:51,250
Why Omega? Why Chanel?

9
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:06,250
Why is it that even the students have chauffeurs?

10
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:11,625
It's so ridiculous!

11
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm tired of the seeing the same thing for past two years.

12
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:25,375
Eitoku Gakuen is a school for the rich.

13
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:31,333
A private school which provides Kindergarten...

14
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,920
to High School education for the rich.

15
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:38,542
Amazing!

16
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:41,500
Where did you buy this handphone accessory from?
- Vegas

17
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:46,083
Took me a lot of effort to buy it since it was only limited edition.

18
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,250
I wish I was there.

19
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:53,000
What a pity.

20
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,250
Looking at them,

21
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:58,293
I really don't know what they come to school for.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,172
<Evaluation on Educational Travel>

23
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,833
Ever since I, a commoner, entered this high school...

24
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,625
my life has been a very eventful one.

25
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,125
The Red Paper!

26
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,000
The Red Paper!

27
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,208
Kimoto Takayuki of 2A has been given the red paper!

28
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,625
Homeroom will now end.

29
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:46,958
We must now catch Kimoto.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,333
Yea! Great!

31
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,418
Let go off me!

32
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:28,333
Sigh...

33
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,292
Are you Makino?

34
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:37,458
I'm not sure myself, but can we really not follow?

35
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,917
This transfer student who doesn't know a thing,

36
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:49,000
she will definitely regret coming to this horrible school.

37
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,250
What's up with everyone?

38
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:55,625
What is the "Red Paper"?

39
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,792
That would be F4's declaration of war.

40
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,375
F4?

41
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:06,042
They are 4 Year 3 students called "Flower 4",

42
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,377
which eventually shortened to F4.

43
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,833
Should anyone piss them off, that person will get the Red Paper.

44
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:17,667
And he will be completely bullied by the rest of the school.

45
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:31,083
Why does everyone listen to F4?

46
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,833
Those guys are the sons of extremely rich families.

47
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:40,208
Aren't everyone in this school likewise?

48
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:42,708
The difference is great.

49
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:51,167
The school gets large sums of donations from their parents,

50
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,375
hence even the teachers fear them,

51
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:58,833
and privately agreed to allow them a free reign in school.

52
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,292
It's F4!

53
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:07,167
That is why you never see them in school uniform.

54
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:20,417
F4... F4... F4...

55
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:24,167
The members of F4 are...

56
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:27,500
Mimasaka Akira...

57
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:33,333
He likes to hit on married women 10 years older than him.

58
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,167
His father also loves women,
and is the boss of the underground world.

59
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,833
Nishikado Sojiro...

60
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:48,250
He inherited the family tea business, and likes women as well.

61
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,375
Hanazawa Rui...

62
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:00,250
His father is the President of a huge corporation.

63
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:07,417
His constant state of depression has always been a mystery.

64
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,000
And finally, Domyoji Tsukasa.

65
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:23,333
The son of the world famous Domyoji plutocrat.
(Plutocrat: A wealthy class that controls a government)

66
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:29,083
He is the leader of F4, and also the dictator of this school.

67
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,625
Domyoji is Kimoto's friend.

68
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,833
Don't leave... Don't leave...

69
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,250
Let's play.

70
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,292
Go ahead!

71
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,750
I've said before that it will be like this.

72
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:05,417
Sigh. Didn't expect it.

73
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,917
Don't be a chicken and frightened.

74
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,875
We'd expect nothing less from Domyoji, such cool moves...

75
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:44,167
I really hate people who like to talk a lot.

76
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,875
This is just a waste of my time.

77
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,458
Alright. The match has ended.

78
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,417
That was great!

79
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:30,875
Have they all lost their minds? What F4?

80
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:35,168
Those crazy idiots, taking a mad game like this so far.

81
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:39,500
They're so apathetic about their own friends getting beaten up.

82
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,917
This is unbelievable.

83
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,500
This is unbelievable!!

84
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,917
Yes...

85
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,917
Only half a year to go, might as well endure it.

86
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:19,000
Sometimes I hate life.
If only this period of time would peacefully pass.

87
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:28,542
That is my only wish,

88
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,542
but even so...

89
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,125
Hana Yori Dango - The Flower Boy
Episode 1

90
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,042

00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:41,208

Nishikado Sojiro ** Matsuda Shota

95

Mimasaka Akira ** Abe Tsuyoshi

96
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:44,833
Eh... The Red Paper appeared again.

97
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,917
What on earth did that guy do wrong?

98
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,708
When he was eating an orange, the juice squirted out.

99
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,003
What?

100
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:03,000
The orange juice squirted into Domyoji's eye.

101
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:04,500
Huh?

102
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:11,632
The Flower 4 is as precious as flowers,
that is why...

103
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,417
No one had the guts to say anything,

104
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,042
so he was beaten up by the 4 of them.

105
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,167
From what it seems,

106
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,589
you might get beaten up as well if you say those things in school.

107
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,208
Mm.

108
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,958
Yuki, have this.

109
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,167
Why don't you eat it instead? It's almost expiring.
- It's okay.

110
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,958
You seem to take it very well.

111
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,125
But I've upset my stomach before.

112
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm not talking about that.

113
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:42,375
Hmm?

114
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:47,458
Strange that you didn't do anything about those apathetic people.

115
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,333
When I was younger,
Tsukushi-chan would protect me if I was bullied.

116
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,083
Even during Kindergarten...

117
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,417
Primary school...

118
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,334
And Secondary school...

119
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:14,708
But now no one in Eitoku Gakuen knows about that side of you.

120
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:19,292
I definitely feel like brutally hitting them,

121
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,875
and kicking them out of Eitoku Gakuen.

122
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,167
But...

123
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:33,125
Mom! You put eggs in the rice cooker?

124
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,833
It's okay, you need the heat to cook eggs anyway.

125
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,500
Here you go!

126
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,208
Yes.

127
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,792
Ah. Yes. Tsukushi.

128
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:45,208
From tomorrow onwards, you will bring this lunch box set to school.

129
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,042
I only took it out after you graduated.

130
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,125
But... Using those kind of lunch boxes will be a little...

131
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:57,000
This was a gift from grandma when I got married.

132
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,375
Oh, what a pretty wedding dress.

133
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:03,542
Of course. I'll treat you your favourite prawns tomorrow.

134
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,500
Why spend so much at one go?

135
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,292
Hey, dinner time!

136
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,667
Coming.

137
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,917
That's about enough for today.

138
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,333
There's still 3 days worth left.

139
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,378
Dad. Didn't you agree to only drink a bottle a week?

140
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,750
Alright. I want to challenge myself.

141
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:27,208
A bottle in 10 days!

142
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,375
That's great.

143
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:33,208
Well then, I want to aim for the Middle-High School

144
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,583
with the lowest fees in Japan.

145
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,292
Great!

146
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:43,167
Well, you really don't have to go to that extent
for me to attend Eitoku Gakuen.

147
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,583
No. That's the fun we get out of saving money.

148
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:53,500
Everyone's so happy I was able to get into Eitoku Gakuen.

149
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,583
Mr. Makino. I heard that a lot of your money
is going to Eitoku Gakuen.

150
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,792
Well, that's...

151
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:06,375
Mrs. Makino. I heard your daughter managed to get into Eitoku Gakuen.

152
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:08,542
Well, that's...

153
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,542
Makino, I heard your sister got into Eitoku Gakuen.

154
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,083
Well, that's...

155
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:20,750
Everyone has been working hard for me.

156
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:25,750
I simply can't tell them I want to skip school.

157
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:31,958
I should never have gone there in the first place.

158
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:36,792
Congratulations to the Year 1 and 2 students
who have made it here.

159
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:43,374
Welcome one and all to Eitoku Gakuen.

160
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,332
Wow. She's so beautiful. Just like a model.

161
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:50,420
Seems like the one who will be inheriting the Toudou business

162
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:52,583
is currently studying in France.

163
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,375
She's so rich!

164
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,501
Please be quiet.

165
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,792
I would like to say a few words to all who wish to graduate here.

166
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:15,333
Please choose your own path in life.

167
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:23,500
This way, you will have no regrets about your school life.

168
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:29,083
Wanting to become a great person like her,
I entered Eitoku Gakuen.

169
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:38,000
And I thought it would be a happy life at school.

170
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:42,750
I hate this school. I hate F4, those idiots.

171
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,208
I can't stand my indifferent schoolmates.

172
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:58,708
But, I hate myself the most for being so unhappy.

173
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,667
This can't be happening.

174
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,042
There's no point in packing this.

175
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,750
Huh?

176
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:37,208
Those are prawns?

177
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:43,250
You must be Sanjou-san, the new transfer student from Class C.

178
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,750
Have you started eating? Let's eat together.

179
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,083
I...

180
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,125
It's only over there, let's go.

181
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:54,500
Sanjou-san. Come, sit here.

182
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,667
Thanks.

183
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,919
No problem.

184
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,958
I'm not too familiar with the boys.

185
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:12,750
I also don't really like being around such people.

186
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:17,125
Hey... Maybe you're... a commoner?

187
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:21,333
My goodness, that's mouldy.

188
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,167
That's just seaweed.

189
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,292
So you actually are a rich kid.

190
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:37,210
Want to try?

191
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,292
Thanks, I'll eat it.

192
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,000
Delicious!

193
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:52,958
Really?

194
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,375
Yes!

195
00:19:57,042 --> 00:20:02,750
Sakurako, such a nice name.

196
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,583
Tsukushi-chan, that's cute too.

197
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,542
No no, just like wild grass.
(Her first name "Makino" translates to "Pasture")

198
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:13,875
Why name myself after a type of food?

199
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,083
I'm sorry.

200
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,458
This certainly is a rare type of greeting.

201
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:37,042
Well...

202
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,000
I'll help pay for the cleaning fees.

203
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:47,083
Cleaning fees? You've got to be kidding me.

204
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:58,000
Now now Tsukasa... Don't bully cute girls.

205
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:02,167
What a pity, I really want to see you 10 years older.

206
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,333
Hey, got an elder sister?

207
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,042
This is cold.

208
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:17,625
What if I catch pneumonia and die?

209
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,667
I, Domyoji, am inheriting
the name supporting Japan's economy.

210
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:34,208
Have you ever considered Japan's future?

211
00:21:35,542 --> 00:21:39,083
What exactly are you thinking? I'm asking you a question!

212
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,458
Stop!

213
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:50,792
Please stop...

214
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:07,083
Please forgive her.

215
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:16,625
She didn't do it on purpose.

216
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,875
I'm praying very hard...

217
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:06,833
Very hard...

218
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:13,625
But in the end, I've fallen into their game.

219
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,458
The Red Paper!

220
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,542
Makino Tsukushi from 2C has got the Red Paper!

221
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:24,585
Just get rid of that girl today.

222
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:27,625
This is the first time a girl has gotten the Red Paper.

223
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,417
Yea.

224
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,583
What happened?

225
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:15,458
What the hell.

226
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,583
Stop it you guys!

227
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:53,917
Makino-san. A lesson is in progress.

228
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,875
I'm sorry.

229
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,500
Sakurako.

230
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,375
Even your friend has left you.

231
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:29,375
It's because you have always been a pain in the eye.

232
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:34,000
A commoner's child, daring to study in such a school.

233
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,915
Hurry up and get out of here.

234
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:40,083
Slut.

235
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,458
Damn.

236
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,542
Damn.

237
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,958
Damn.

238
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:21,250
Please... stop it... alright?

239
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:28,333
Don't shout and curse here.

240
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:34,292
So it was you after all.

241
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,917
Huh?

242
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:44,583
Is it possible for you to stop ranting here?

243
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,875
You've been listening.

244
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:07,042
I'm sorry, but this emergency staircase is my place.

245
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:17,917
It's very important, I don't wish to be disturbed.

246
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:46,208
The situation must be very troubling for you now.

247
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:40,625
That girl isn't affected at all.

248
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,667
What's going on?

249
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:44,917
My apologies.

250
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,417
She says that tomorrow...

251
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,792
You do know the consequences of failing, I assume.

252
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:59,208
I think transferring school would be the best.

253
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,875
You really think that way?

254
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,667
Of course!

255
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:05,625
Tsukushi.

256
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:10,000
That Domyoji, he is the son of a plutocrat?

257
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,833
When did you start listening to us?

258
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:18,250
So it is true. And he is likely to have links to the underground.

259
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:23,250
No matter what we do, we are still at his mercy.

260
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:24,917
At his mercy?

261
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:30,417
I've met a similar man before,
always fighting with his brothers for power.

262
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:33,708
An unknowingly, he was used by them.

263
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,125
Wait a minute. Where exactly did you come from?

264
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:40,629
Tsukushi-chan, I advice you to be more alert.

265
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:10,583
What is it?

266
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,833
Hold her down!

267
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,083
No!

268
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,875
Let me go!

269
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,833
Stop stuggling.

270
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:33,208
What are guys doing?

271
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,250
Well...

272
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,250
Let her go.

273
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,667
But if this is not done, this girl will...

274
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:59,458
It's alright.

275
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:02,167
I said let her go.

276
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:43,500
The cleaning lady is...

277
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:47,667
cleaning the emergency staircase.

278
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,000
It was so difficult just finding a quiet place.

279
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:52,754
I never expected this.

280
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:11,917
Th... Thanks.

281
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:16,250
Don't get me wrong here.

282
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:22,250
I just hate the methods they use.

283
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,000
Rui?

284
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:45,958
Yes. He appeared at the last minute...

285
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:49,043
Why didn't you get rid of the girl earlier?

286
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:58,625
I'll be returning to New York, when I've finished the M&A business.

287
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:02,333
What was the response from the Manhattan bank?

288
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,917
No. Just stop the deal.

289
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:12,417
Maybe, we should reconsider.
- I said stop it, right now.

290
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,167
So you're here.

291
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:21,375
Excuse me.

292
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:27,167
Is this what you say to your son whom you've
not seen for half a year?

293
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,833
Please call the chef here.

294
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,667
Yes ma'am.

295
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:44,583
You called me, ma'am?

296
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:51,083
You don't need to be here from tomorrow onwards.

297
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:03,083
Mishida. Please employ a new chef.

298
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,917
Yes ma'am.

299
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,667
Ah! The roasted chicken skin is here.

300
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,000
Thank you for the food!

301
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,458
Wait!

302
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:43,292
Let's finish off half the rice first from the aroma alone.

303
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,539
Oh, so this way it'll taste better.

304
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,917
Yes.

305
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:52,417
Have a go...

306
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,000
Please stop that.

307
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:07,333
Being thrifty isn't all that fun.

308
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,750
Sister, what's wrong?

309
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,500
It must be that the stress from school is too heavy.

310
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,125
I'm already feeling troubled enough.

311
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:23,042
You just can't force yourself to attend Eitoku Gakuen

312
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,167
while relying on everyone being so thrifty.

313
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,917
Akira-kun, I've got a present for you.

314
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,750
Eh? What is it?

315
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,083
<Divorce Agreement Form>

316
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:07,333
This way, I'll marry you when you finish schooling.

317
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:15,958
Thank you for being with me, I'm very glad.

318
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:19,999
Hang on. Akira-kun!

319
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:21,750
Get her out of here.

320
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,042
Wait! Akira-kun!

321
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,708
Ah... You really are evil.

322
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,333
It's still better than you who are 21 years old.

323
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:36,250
Eh? Really, Sojiro?

324
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:39,292
Men and women, need not bother about age, no?

325
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,500
Your skin is very smooth and tender.

326
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:48,083
Such beauty.

327
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,542
You're just kidding...

328
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:54,167
Yes.

329
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,501
Rui didn't come?

330
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,250
That kid just loves to hide in remote and quiet places.

331
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,625
But you shouldn't bother about him, Tsukasa-kun.

332
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:18,083
That is all their scheming work.

333
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,542
What are you getting so upset about?

334
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,542
If that girl is not gone, this game will never end.
("game" refers to the Red Paper incidents in school)

335
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:28,292
Don't be so serious,
you're just having some fun after all.

336
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:33,963
But one day,
you're going to be so powerful

337
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,292
that even that school will not be
worth talking about.

338
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,167
What was that for?

339
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,250
You really are troublesome.

340
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,584
What are you saying?

341
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:17,208
Ah. Just like a flower, how cute.

342
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,708
That kid said, it's alright to give him less,

343
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,500
just give more to his sis'.

344
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:24,792
I see.

345
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,500
I must give you a bit of this.

346
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:30,292
No it's okay, give it to Tsukushi.

347
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,208
But...

348
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:34,083
I'm fine, just a little will do.

349
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:42,125
Yea, don't forget to put in Tsukushi's favourite, the prawns.

350
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:45,000
Tsukushi will be very happy.

351
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,250
You're tired, you should go to bed.

352
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,542
Can I borrow a light?

353
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:59,125
Bro, a light please?

354
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,375
You didn't hear me?

355
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:42,625
You've got to be kidding me.

356
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,625
Thank you for the food.

357
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:41,750
Hmph. A commoner desperately trying to imitate the upper class.

358
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:49,500
Men like me can tell by just one look.

359
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:04,708
This is nothing but a packed lunch
made by some old woman.

360
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,083
Hey you, come here.

361
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,333
What is it?

362
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,958
My shoes are dirty.

363
00:42:47,213 --> 00:42:51,417
Don't forget to put in Tsukushi's favourite, the prawns.

364
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:54,250
Tsukushi will be very happy.

365
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,583
Hold it.

366
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:14,125
Hah? What did you say?

367
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:28,625
I don't care if you're the son of a plutocrat.

368
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,375
Someone like you hasn't even worked hard for money.

369
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,292
Go to hell!

370
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:12,500
I will not run away.

371
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,500
I will fight you.

372
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:20,375
Come on, if you have the guts.

373
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:29,125
Tsukasa! Take this!

374
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,500
I've really done something big.

375
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:11,667
Once I think about the consequences,

376
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,667
to be honest,

377
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,917
I'm really very scared.

378
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:24,583
But, I will never give up,
even if I'm hit or kicked.

379
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:29,208
Because, I, Tsukushi, am like wild grass.

380
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,667
I have no idea what happened to you.

381
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,708
You should handle this more carefully.

382
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,333
Here.

383
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,375
I'm off.

384
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:46,750
Have a good day.

385
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:22,833
Ha! Which also means you like her.

386
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:25,167
I've missed you dearly.

387
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:26,417
I've missed you too.

388
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:29,583
1 hundred million.
- How am I supposed to pay you that?
