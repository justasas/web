1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,678
Makino and I are going out.

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:03,163
Eh?!

3
00:00:03,163 --> 00:00:05,201
There's always a limit to the extent of a joke.

4
00:00:05,201 --> 00:00:06,664
She's finally starting to make her move, huh?

5
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:08,120
Here is 300 million.

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,285
With this, it's genuinely my turn now, huh?

7
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:13,566
I would like Tsukushi-san to give Tsukasa up completely.

8
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,262
Take your money, and please go home.

9
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:20,083
The reason why I can be here right now,
it's because of Hanazawa Rui.

10
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:21,690
Here, take it.

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,833
Tsukasa seems to be really serious about you, Tsukushi-chan.

12
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,875
But if there's even a bit of a chance, 
I will fully support the both of you.

13
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:29,631
Let's have a double-date tomorrow.

14
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,052
Double-date?!

15
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:33,438
When I said I love you, I really am serious.

16
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:37,321
I will be waiting, until you can give me a definite answer.

17
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,162
Honestly the girl with you is a bimyou (weird, strange)?

18
00:00:40,162 --> 00:00:41,724
I'll introduce you to better women.

19
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:43,194
Makino is a bimyou?

20
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,487
What are you doing?! Stop!

21
00:00:46,487 --> 00:00:49,079
The reason you hit Nakatsuka-kun.  Explain it to me!

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,539
I'm not saying.

23
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:54,163
Yuuki is feeling really sad because of you, you know!

24
00:00:55,033 --> 00:01:00,000
I wonder why I've never fallen in love with you, Makino, 
until now..

25
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:05,542
Just a minute is fine.
Let me stay like this.

26
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:08,324
Oh...

27
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:12,534
So that's how it is?

28
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:22,080
Is that your answer to me?

29
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:29,270
I completely understand.

30
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,512
Domyouji!

31
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:44,216
He's always jumping to conclusions.

32
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:47,852
Jumping to conclusions, huh?

33
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,730
Wait... Hanazawa Rui!

34
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,365
Domyouji-san.

35
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:12,640
Tsukasa, what are you doing?

36
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,103
Tsukasa.

37
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:23,000
Akira... Soujiro...

38
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:27,542
From today onwards, do not speak to Rui.

39
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,515
What are you saying?

40
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:32,365
This guy is no longer our childhood friend or anything.

41
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:35,843
He's just a traitor.

42
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:41,589
Domyouji!

43
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,368
Rui.

44
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:04,914
You will no longer be part of F4.

45
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:12,501
You are no longer a friend..

46
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,125
Calm down.

47
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,792
What happened, Rui?

48
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:21,417
Wait...! Why must Rui leave?

49
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:25,716
You hit people just because your pissed.
You renounce your own friend.

50
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,914
I hate that part of you.

51
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:33,426
Tsukasa.

52
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:42,953
The worst.

53
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:44,392
F4 is breaking up...?

54
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:48,173
It's all because of that vulgar peasant.

55
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:49,466
What did you say?

56
00:03:55,808 --> 00:03:57,121
It's okay.

57
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:00,113
I will protect you.

58
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:06,359
Please...

59
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,667
I cannot accept something like this.

60
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:21,375
But, I will help you.

61
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,009
What an untrustworthy girl.

62
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:35,183
But I love it.

63
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,333
Are you still concerned... regarding Tsukasa?

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,208
Concerned? I'm just pissed.

65
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:58,313
Makino.

66
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,396
Eh?

67
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,551
Shall we go somewhere? Just the two of us?

68
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,318
Being all serious about Makino Tsukushi, renouncing Rui..

69
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,929
Are you listening, Tsukasa?

70
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:19,500
Shut it, Akira.

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,892
Are you my mother-in-law?

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,031
Huh? It's for your sake that..

73
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,855
Tsukasa, I know what Rui did was pretty awful, but..

74
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:30,386
He also has a lot of troubles.

75
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:38,783
Okay? At least look at it.

76
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,110
What's with you?

77
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:47,958
I'm just asking that you consider Rui's feelings...!

78
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:49,240
Soujiro.

79
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,648
I can't stand this, I'm going.

80
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:51,814
Soujiro!

81
00:06:01,996 --> 00:06:06,120
After that, Nakatsuka-kun never contacted me again.

82
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,467
I'm sorry, truly sorry.

83
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:15,200
Those monkeys kinda look like Domyouji.

84
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:17,146
Where did you go?

85
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:18,722
I'm going home!

86
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,924
I'm so pissed, I can't stand it!

87
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:24,236
It's my fault for bringing Domyouji with us.

88
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:33,833
Ahh... That guy really... What he did was just too much...
Plus he's trying to look as if he's the one who was hurt.

89
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:38,167
It's just sick! He's so selfish, and foolish. A weird hair...

90
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,076
Tsukushi's so lucky.

91
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:41,066
Eh?!

92
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,160
No matter where you fall, you'll always "Get" a cute guy.

93
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,100
That has nothing to do with Domyouji.

94
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,031
Nito wo ou mono itto mo ezu
(When you try to make two things yours, you
won't be able to get even one)

95
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,263
I got it!

96
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:55,426
The "knitted thing" is the King's, so the thread should not be burned.
("Nito": knit, "Ou Mono": The King's, 
"itto": thread, "mo ezu": to burn)

97
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:56,423
Nope...

98
00:06:56,423 --> 00:07:02,000
It means that you can't chase after two things,
otherwise you'll end up with nothing.

99
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,700
Oh, so that...

100
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:05,835
Susumu...

101
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:07,069
Wh... What?

102
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,539
Will you be able to rise above in society next time?

103
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:10,948
What's with you, Papa?

104
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:11,667
Tsukushi...

105
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:12,042
Yes.

106
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:12,875
Susumu...

107
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:13,292
Yes.

108
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:14,125
Mama...

109
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:14,708
Yes.

110
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:19,500
You listen here... Papa... Papa...

111
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:23,958
well... has been promoted to chief clerk!

112
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:27,612
Congratulations, Papa!

113
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,419
Congratulations! Congratulations!

114
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:36,792
It's because I put my heart into my job, working hard at it,
and that is how I have achieved what I now am.

115
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,441
Is that so...!

116
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:41,044
That means, Tsukushi has finally become 
a kakarichou reijou (Chief Clerk Honorable Daughter)!

117
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,187
There's no Japanese term like that!

118
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:45,932
This also means, your status is equal to Domyouji-san.

119
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:50,750
Tsukushi, don't look anywhere else.. 
Earnestly pursue Domyouji-san!

120
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:57,667
Tama No Koshi (Marrying into money)!

121
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:36,549
I'm off!

122
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:10,545
Where are you going all dolled up?

123
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:18,188
That's none of your business!

124
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:27,042
Let me pass. I'm off on a date with Hanazawa Rui.

125
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,256
What was that for?!

126
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:34,875
Apologise now. I'm willing to forgive you.

127
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:36,844
Huh?

128
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,873
What I mean, is that I'm giving you one last chance.

129
00:09:42,471 --> 00:09:44,351
Stay away from Rui.

130
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:48,951
Why are you saying this to me?

131
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:51,958
Shut up! Whatever I say is ABSOLUTE!

132
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:59,000
I've had enough of being thrown around by your whims!

I'm so pissed..

146
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:46,167
But, meeting up in a bookstore is just like Hanazawa Rui.

147

<Toudou Shizuka-san is rumoured to become the bride of

No way...

149
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,192
I've never done anything for her.

150
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:09,167
Oh no. If Hanazawa Rui were to find out about this...

151
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,771
Sorry to have you wait.

152
00:13:12,878 --> 00:13:13,833
What's wrong?

153
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:17,092
No... Nothing...

154
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:18,673
Well! Let's go?

155
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,053
I need to buy something.

156
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:27,375
Ah... I'm thirsty... Tea! You want tea?

157
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,085
Let's go... Off to drink tea...

158
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,458
Here, let's go in.

159
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:46,166
<To [Nakatsuka]>

160
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,679
What about Makino Tsukushi?

161
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,703
Didn't she go out on a date with Hanazawa Rui?

162
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,787
Huh?!

163
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:53,331
Rui has completely gone out of his mind...

164
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:59,208
Makino is Makino, too.. What is she doing, 
being being "fura fura" (indecisive).

165
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:03,250
Hey... please stop bad-talking Tsukushi.

166
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,632
Wow, you're always thinking about your friends...

167
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:07,696
I seriously can't stand this anymore.

168
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,511
I have a tea-ceremony. I'm going home.

169
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,757
Soujiro!

170
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:17,875
Yuuki, do watch out. Sometimes people just hate busybodies.

171
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,381
Hey!

172
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:21,776
Each and every one of them..

173
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:23,212
Akira-kun!

174
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,730
Hanazawa Rui, what did you order?

175
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:42,614
Ginger Ale.

176
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:46,208
Oh... Ginger Ale...

177
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:58,000
Did you know, Ginger Ale's true form is actually shouga (ginger).
I was so shocked when I found out..

178
00:14:58,006 --> 00:15:02,000
It's like a vegetable.. plus it's like medicine..

179
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,185
Really?

180
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:12,292
Yeah... But maybe not...

181
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:21,124
You've been on a date with Tsukasa, right?

182
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,659
I don't think you call that a date.

183
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,768
Going places with him is like "Tour to Hell".

184
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,448
"Tour to Hell"?

185
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:34,625
I went out with him and some friends,
and he started hitting my friend's boyfriend.

186
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:39,667
On another date, we took the elevator,
and we were stuck in there until morning.

187
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:45,241
It's unbelievable.

188
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:49,292
Then that guy suddenly runs a fever and collapses..

189
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:51,920
In a place like this... What are you thinking?

190
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:57,833
To tell you the truth, nothing good happens when I'm with that guy..

191
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:03,328
Excuse me...

192
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,321
I'll ask them to get the menu.

193
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:29,911
Why did I suddenly remember him?

194
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:35,849
I finally get to be on a date with Hanazawa Rui.

195
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,530
You seem to be going through a lot of trouble.

196
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,872
You've gotten yourself wet.

197
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:44,098
Thank you.

198
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:49,499
Right, this should be better.

199
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,664
Eh?

200
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:08,075
Atleast lock the door..

201
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:21,373
YAAARGH!!

202
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:27,000
Domyouji-san! What a coincidence!

203
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,047
Are you out for a walk?

204
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:33,042
You... What kind of nerve do you have, talking to me and all.

205
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:37,458
I'm glad. You still remember me.

206
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,014
How could I forget?

207
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,479
Would you like to go for tea?

208
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,248
Don't touch me!

209
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,353
Are you scared of persistent women?

210
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:48,083
YOU! Don't push it...

211
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:55,125
You're a man who still has lingering affections..

212
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:59,950
Why don't you give up while it's still early?

213
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,632
Makino Tsukushi chose Hanazawa Rui on her own.

214
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:11,094
You...

215
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,922
Do you want me to completely deface you?

216
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:18,013
As you wish.

217
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,285
Huh?

218
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:22,228
This face was bought because of you anyway.

219
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:30,042
You can do as you wish. It's much better than
you ignoring me.

220
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:40,681
Why don't you stop crying, already?

221
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:46,923
This isn't something you should be worried about.

222
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:49,295
What part of it?!

223
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:55,167
You saw me when I was on the toilet... 
what more... with my PANTIES DOWN...

224
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:06,071
You're really funny, aren't you?

225
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:12,625
It's been so long since I've laughed like this.

226
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,372
You...

227
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,875
You're pretty twisted.

228
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:34,516
The way you're looking at me, it's pretty creepy.

229
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:47,228
Sorry for making you wait.

230
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:56,232
Tsukushi-chan, you look really cute, today!

231
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:58,289
Dating someone you've always loved

232
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:00,824
Would make you give it your best!

233
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,160
What's up with you?

234
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,914
Hey, Rui!

235
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:06,329
What do you mean by this?

236
00:20:07,401 --> 00:20:10,278
You know that Shizuka is getting engaged, right?

237
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:14,242
How can you say that, insensitive jerk?

238
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:16,760
How can you hurt people so easily like it's nothing to you?

239
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,550
I was doing it for your-

240
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,890
Besides, what's up with you?! Following me all the way here..

241
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:23,390
How about you? You're ambushing me everywhere I'm headed to.

242
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,510
Huh?! Who would want to do that?

243
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,710
What's up with that "hira hira"(fluttering around) skirt? 
Do you think it looks good on you?

244
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,130
Leave me alone! I didn't wear it for you to look at!

245
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,850
It's sickening. 
Even if I don't want to see it, it has entered my sight already.

246
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,760
What's with you? Which great one are you supposed to be?

247
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,730
"The Great I Am"

248
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,450
The worst!

249
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,040
You're the worst! You stupid sh*tty woman!

250
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,330
What's that?! You natural kuro kuro (curly) hair!

251
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,020
K-k-kuro kuro hair?!?! I'm gonna kill you!

252
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,481
Ah, ah, ah~

253
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:48,711
And it was such a fun date that I've been waiting for..

254
00:20:48,711 --> 00:20:50,737
but thanks to you it's completely destroyed!

255
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:53,450
Let's go Hanazawa Rui.

256
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:54,878
Hmph

257
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,686
Are you alright?

258
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:07,420
SCRAM!

259
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:08,872
Eh?

260
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:11,383
You were purposefully following me around, right?

261
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,073
Hurry up and scram.

262
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:24,377
I will never give up, you know.

263
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:26,950
Someday, for sure..

264
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,410
I will show you that I can chase Makino Tsukushi 
away from your heart.

265
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,164
Why..

266
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:42,424
can't he think of anyone but himself?

267
00:21:42,424 --> 00:21:43,973
Selfishly causing trouble..

268
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:45,771
Letting people go round and round..

269
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:49,392
Everyone will be thankful for you..

270
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,328
Huh?

271
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:53,057
There once was a man that I loved..

272
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:56,857
Above everything else,
 he loved to see happiness upon other people's faces..

273
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:01,908
"To bring happiness to all the children of the whole world.."

274
00:22:01,908 --> 00:22:05,537
When winter comes he stuffs a white sack with presents..

275
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:09,784
Wearing a red suit and going on his journey..

276
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:10,668
Santa?

277
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:13,372
And for that man, he pulled the sleigh..

278
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:14,719
Reindeer?

279
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:17,727
Even when he's pulling such a heavy sled..

280
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:21,431
it's the man in red who always gets the leading part..

281
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:23,891
but

282
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:29,055
He who is foolishly honest about undertaking such a plain role..

283
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:33,480
For me, he's the one who shines the brightest!

284
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:40,246
Deep inside their hearts, everyone is actually thankful for those kind of men..

285
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:45,452
"I'm glad you are here with me.." Right?

286
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:05,360
[Compose a message]
Nakatsuka-kun, what happened? Please e-mail -

287
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,048
Everything went well.

288
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:21,313
Is that so?

289
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,290
Excuse me.

290
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,328
Nishida.

291
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:25,942
Yes.

292
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,191
For safety's sake..

293
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:31,040
put the contingency plan into action..

294
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,690
Understood.

295
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,851
I already knew about Shizuka.

296
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:39,806
Eh?

297
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:45,058
When I was in Paris, she was quite popular already..

298
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:48,096
I see..

299
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,075
Thank you.

300
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:56,690
You've always been trying to hide it from me, right?

301
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,763
Uh, no.. I wasn't really..

302
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:05,749
Oh man..

303
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:06,884
Huh?

304
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:10,007
That cute part of you..

305
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:13,104
Tsukasa..

306
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:15,981
noticed it far more earlier than I did..

307
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:20,909
Are you sure that you're truly choosing Hanazawa Rui?

308
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:23,115
When I was in pain,

309
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:26,772
Hanazawa Rui has always saved me..

310
00:24:27,322 --> 00:24:29,434
That's why..

311
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,268
this time I want to be his strength..

312
00:24:33,212 --> 00:24:35,800
Is that okay?
Your reason just sounds like a charity case.

313
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,687
It's not charity at all..

314
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:43,226
From the very beginning,
The one that I've always always loved the most..

315
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,440
is Hanazawa Rui.

316
00:24:46,696 --> 00:24:48,282
Fine, fine..

317
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:50,644
Hey, Tsukushi.

318
00:24:50,644 --> 00:24:52,440
Can you go with me somewhere?

319
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:57,651
This is where I first met Nakatsuka-kun.

320
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:01,431
Hey, you make it sound like it's a Sanctuary of Memories..

321
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,833
He was flirting, right?

322
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,309
Hey, you know what..

323
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:13,033
I don't think he deserves you-

324
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:25,844
Naka-

325
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:27,061
Sorry to keep you waiting!

326
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:30,143
She's at it again, what a drag!

327
00:25:30,143 --> 00:25:31,537
What? Girlfriend?

328
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:33,120
It's not like that..

329
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,033
It's a stalker, just a stalker..

330
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,638
So stubborn..

331
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:37,849
Is that so?

332
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:40,177
Then, where are you taking me today?

333
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:45,943
For now, why don't we get something to eat, then watch a movie?

334
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,757
then after that...

335
00:25:47,757 --> 00:25:49,173
After that?

336
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,385
Who is she? Someone you know?

337
00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:00,360
Don't know her.

338
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:03,836
But maybe I might've seen this face before?

339
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,326
Yuuki!

340
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:12,946
Why don't you run after her and console her?

341
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:22,859
I will NEVER forgive you!

342
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:27,106
Yuuki-chan?
She already left for the day..

343
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:30,856
If she contacts you, please let me know immediately.

344
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,290
She's really the type that I'm not good at..

345
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:15,361
What's wrong?

346
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,060
B-b-bitter..

347
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:30,830
Isn't it?

348
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:33,553
I was still a kid the first time I drank this..

349
00:27:33,553 --> 00:27:37,136
I thought this is not for human beings to drink..

350
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:40,078
but,

351
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:42,678
the truth is, this bitterness is good..

352
00:27:42,678 --> 00:27:46,046
Knowing that, I walked down "The Way of Tea".

353
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:48,471
Love is the same..

354
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:56,083
With a painful.. and bitter love, people will grow.

355
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:01,627
Yuuki-chan, this time you needed this.

356
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,007
So next time you won't make the same mistake, right?

357
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,104
Yes.

358
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:16,140
Okay!

359
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,874
Let's go now. I'll just change, okay?

360
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:20,360
It's okay.

361
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,866
I can go home by myself.

362
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,259
That's not it.

363
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:25,520
Today, I'm really all messed up.

364
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,426
Eh?

365
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:28,351
What I mean is..

366
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:30,359
Vengeance game!

367
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,892
Vengeance?

368
00:28:33,522 --> 00:28:35,740
Is it really okay if everything remains this way?

369
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,629
If it's meddlesome preaching, I'm not listening.

370
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:40,325
Is it really okay for the F4 to break apart this way?

371
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:43,806
Do you want me to throw you out?!

372
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,305
Think very well..

373
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:32,016
Yuuki..

374
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:37,321
Where are you, Yuuki?

375
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:46,313
Why don't we get something to eat, then watch a movie?

376
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:48,201
Movie, huh?

377
00:29:57,502 --> 00:29:59,169
Why him?

378
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,185
Are you gonna beat him up?

379
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:04,470
As if.

380
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,361
I'm going to teach him just what a great guy really is.

381
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:13,896
No way!

382
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,564
It's F4's Nishikado-san!

383
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,695
No way..
Nishikado Soujiro?

384
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:19,700
Huh?

385
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,329
Who's that?

386
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,771
Your girlfriend is really pretty that it caught my attention.

387
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,002
Is that so?

388
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:29,303
What's up with you, teme (you, rude)?

389
00:30:29,303 --> 00:30:30,790
Wanna go somewhere else?

390
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,404
Let's go.. Let's go.. Let's go!

391
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:35,485
Hey, let's go.

392
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:36,870
What's with you?

393
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,757
Don't get me wrong just because I was playing with you a little..

394
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:44,707
Have it your way!

395
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:46,815
My girlfriend before you was much better.

396
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:48,218
Oh, really?
Bye, bye!

397
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:49,606
Hey, where are we going?

398
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,630
Sorry.  Don't want to, after all.

399
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,965
Right now, I already have a true love.

400
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:00,533
Yuuki..

401
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:01,665
Huh?

402
00:31:01,665 --> 00:31:04,527
Yuuki-chan, someone you know?

403
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:11,602
Don't know him..

404
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:14,696
But maybe I might've seen this face before.

405
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:22,042
What's going on?

406
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:28,509
If you ever make my woman cry again,

407
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:32,668
I will drag and pull out your internal organs.

408
00:31:41,214 --> 00:31:44,363
Meddling, too.
It's not bad after all, huh?

409
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:49,020
Ah, you..

410
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,688
I get it.

411
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,103
It's that guy, Domyouji's harrasment, right?

412
00:31:57,723 --> 00:32:00,241
I said it out of kindness.

413
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:02,937
Instead of a bimyou woman like you,

414
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:05,740
I'll introduce you to much better women.

415
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:11,687
The reason you hit Nakatsuka-kun. Explain it to me!

416
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:12,717
I'm not telling.

417
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:20,443
Can't even commit one unfaithful act. He's really a weak man.

418
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:26,071
Well, a bimyou woman like you is just perfect for him.

419
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:30,886
Wait a minute.

420
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,531
Huh?

421
00:32:38,344 --> 00:32:41,072
I'm sorry for being a bimyou woman.

422
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:53,222
Domyouji is..

423
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:59,188
not a person that a trash like you can ever understand!!

424
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,897
Yes.

425
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,191
Akira.

426
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:47,280
I'm going to be meeting up with Rui.

427
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:50,730
He told me to go to Shizuka's billboard.

428
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,202
That bastard..

429
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:54,529
he's already been renounced, and he still calls me out.

430
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:56,958
Hey, Tsukasa.  Calm down!

431
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:57,835
I'm going to kill him.

432
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:58,763
Oi, Tsukasa!

433
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:17,241
Even you never cools down. What now?

434
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:19,938
Coz, who knows what Tsukasa will do to Rui.

435
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:22,297
Oh man, what an awfully busy day..

436
00:34:22,297 --> 00:34:23,245
Ah!

437
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:53,825
'Sup, Rui?

438
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:57,827
How was it?

439
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,908
The date with Makino.

440
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:04,086
Yeah, it was fun!

441
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:07,180
Really?

442
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,542
That kind of commoner's date..

443
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:14,006
someone of my level will never be able to last it..

444
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:17,018
I see.

445
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:20,214
Rui had fun, huh?

446
00:35:21,342 --> 00:35:23,105
That's great.

447
00:35:24,232 --> 00:35:25,928
Really great!

448
00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:34,389
That kind of woman. I'll attach seaweed and deliver her to you.
(Tsukasa: nori tsuke te - attach nori)

449
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:35,215
It's Noshi, you know?
(correct:  noshi wo tsukeru - make a gift out of her)

450
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:36,770
Barbequed Seafood.

451
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:39,705
Can you not refer to her like you own her?

452
00:35:41,198 --> 00:35:42,278
Huh?

453
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:48,635
Whichever way you say it, she's mine, right?

454
00:35:52,197 --> 00:35:54,936
Earlier, it was really bad.

455
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:59,207
Makino insisted that "I don't want to go home"

456
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:05,827
If I kiss her, I thought she'd go home, but..

457
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:09,944
On the contrary, after this and that, she started wanting more..

458
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:13,033
This and that?

459
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:14,588
Hey, Rui.

460
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,330
That girl,

461
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,928
She's usually brave and courageous..

462
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:25,479
At times like that, she acts just like a girl.

463
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:27,614
Rui, stop it!

464
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:30,008
At times like that..?

465
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:32,202
Ah-

466
00:36:32,202 --> 00:36:34,807
It's alright, Tsukasa..

467
00:36:35,646 --> 00:36:37,473
After all, I didn't do anything.

468
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:42,489
Coz', it's Makino, you know?

469
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:47,639
I can't do something that ridiculous.

470
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:04,604
What do you think you're doing?

471
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:15,409
You!

472
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:16,360
- Calm down.
- Shut up!

473
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,625
Right now, my bowels are burning.
(Tsukasa: harawata ga nikkorogatte n dayo)

474
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,529
It's "I'm infuriated inside"
(Correct:  harawata ga niekurikaetteru)

475
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,939
I'm tired of listening to a meddling bastard!

476
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:24,807
Tsukasa, stop it!

477
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:27,257
Who's fault do you think it is that I'm being meddlesome!

478
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:28,704
What's the point of you joining in?

479
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,883
Shut up!
Why don't you just stand back and drink tea!

480
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:54,224
Domyouji..

481
00:37:55,896 --> 00:37:57,454
I'm sorry..

482
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:06,750
I was never able to understood you..

483
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,374
Not really knowing anything and misunderstanding..

484
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,542
I wounded you, Domyouji..

485
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:24,664
You were incomplex, selfish and violent but..

486
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:26,871
You were honest with me..

487
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:41,991
and you acted like I was precious..

488
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,045
Right now, it might be too late..

489
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:51,687
but..

490
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:54,320
Just this, I want to be able to tell you.

491
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:57,809
I'm sorry.

492
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:03,234
I was never able to notice your kindness..

493
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:07,458
I'm sorry.

494
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,307
Childhood friend or whatever..

495
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:28,859
Any guy who hurts Makino..

496
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,137
will never get away from me..

497
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:46,148
You should've said that way in the beginning.

498
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:47,431
Huh?!!

499
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,976
It was a lie, everything was..

500
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:59,226
Because of you, Tsukasa,

501
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:03,830
I'm not able to eat apples anymore. Revenge.

502
00:40:05,752 --> 00:40:07,069
What?

503
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:09,223
Are you serious?

504
00:40:12,304 --> 00:40:13,548
Rui.

505
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:16,843
Teme.

506
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,137
Makino's..

507
00:40:43,169 --> 00:40:46,117
stories were all about you, Tsukasa.

508
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,088
That's great, Tsukasa.

509
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:55,345
Shut up.

510
00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:56,483
You're happy, aren't you?

511
00:41:32,084 --> 00:41:34,281
Here.

512
00:41:36,064 --> 00:41:37,207
Akira's meddlesome action..

513
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:39,305
has finally been useful. Only once after ten years..

514
00:41:39,305 --> 00:41:40,000
Shut up!

515
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,448
See, if you try, you can do it..

516
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,160
Let me just say this, but..

517
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,055
if something happens between you and Makino..

518
00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:27,100
I will not hold back, okay?

519
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,316
That's fine!

520
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,733
What are you doing?

521
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:44,886
Nothing really.

522
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,732
What happened?

523
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,109
Hhmm..

524
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:51,770
I fell..

525
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,920
Eh?

526
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,076
Thank you for yesterday..

527
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:02,113
Me too, I had so much fun!

528
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,609
Let's go on a date again ,okay?

529
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:04,991
This Sunday?

530
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:06,680
Uh, I can't wait that long..

531
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,607
How about today? Today!

532
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:10,164
Makino.

533
00:43:21,813 --> 00:43:22,513
No!

534
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:28,011
I'm sorry.

535
00:43:33,635 --> 00:43:35,362
If I don't do this..

536
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,356
you'll never admit it to yourself..

537
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,717
Always needing to be looked after..

538
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:43,402
You and

539

Tsukasa, too.

[Ore-sama] (The Great I Am)

541
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:26,924
If you threw away that cellphone..

542
00:44:26,924 --> 00:44:29,114
I was thinking "I'd kill you".

543
00:44:32,272 --> 00:44:33,557
Umm..

544
00:44:34,603 --> 00:44:36,454
Domyouji..

545
00:44:36,454 --> 00:44:38,537
I'm sorry.

546
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:41,689
You hit Nakatsuka-kun..

547
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:45,294
because of me..

548
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:46,452
Huh?

549
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:48,682
What are you talking about?

550
00:44:48,682 --> 00:44:50,125
Don't know anything about that.

551
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:57,702
Domyouji Tower's Heliport.

552
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:01,215
Come right now.

553
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:03,551
If not I'll half-kill you..

554
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,280
What.. He's always one-sided..

555
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,400
What's wrong?

556
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,620
Papa has...

557
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,090
Papa has been laid-off!

558
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,850
He should... have been... the chief clerk...

559
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,500
WHY!?

560
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,464
Are you baka?

561
00:46:21,464 --> 00:46:23,290
Who do you think you are?

562
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:26,000
There's a Beauty Contest to determine the Best Lady in Japan.

563
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,360
I'm always your ally.

564
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,630
Wanna get married?

565
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,631
Eh?
