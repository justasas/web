3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,740
I was wondering how I was
going to bother Gu Jun Pyo,

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,120
but an offer came up where I was
catching two birds with one stone.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,010
Who put you up to this?

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,830
And why?

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,680
Isn't it funny just imagining it?

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,750
Gu Jun Pyo got so furious after
he got his girl stolen by me,

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,460
but when he finds out that
his mom paid me to do it...

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,410
Mom?

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,970
The person who ordered this to
happen is Gu Jun Pyo's mother?

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,980
If you had only agreed with me,

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,970
I was going to give you half my money.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,540
You should have done better.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,260
What's that supposed to mean?

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,710
The moment you rejected my proposal,

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,350
the goal of this game
became only Gu Jun Pyo.

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,600
Why are you doing this to Gu Jun Pyo?

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,440
Why?

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,560
Everyone here probably have at
least three to four reasons

21
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:10,161
why they want to take
revenge on Gu Jun Pyo.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,670
You want to hear all of them?

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,590
Tell the truth!

24
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,880
Why are you doing this to Gu Jun Pyo!
And tell me what Gu Jun Pyo did to you!

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,240
To be exact...

26
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,130
He wronged my brother.

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,300
Brother?

28
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,300
Do you remember?

29
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,250
My older brother who was more loving to his
despised half-brother than my own father.

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,250
Jan Di sunbae,

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,550
Take a good look at me.

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,910
Don't I remind you of someone?

33
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,770
This isn't a school. It's hell.

34
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,680
NO!

35
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,510
No way...

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,970
The rooftop?

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,000
Bingo.

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,370
I'll tell him how you're doing.

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,630
Although he's gotten very
weak from what happened.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,450
He still smiles when he talks about you.

41
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,630
You!

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,110
That's right.

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,000
I wanted revenge.

44
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,040
But...

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,890
As I got closer to you,

46
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,820
I thought if you came to me,
revenge wouldn't matter.

47
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,770
I had thoughts like this.

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,110
I was really like that...

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,510
Go in already!

50
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,040
<i>Geum Jan Di! Are you okay?</i>

51
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,710
<i>Shut up!</i>

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,370
Gu Jun Pyo! Gu Jun Pyo!

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,110
Geum Jan Di, you're okay right?
Nothing happened right?

54
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,420
Gu Jun Pyo.

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,670
Why did you come?
What are you going to do by coming here!

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,930
Did you check?

57
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,560
Yeah, he's all alone.

58
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,010
Idiot with no fears.

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,540
I bet you didn't know it was
your death day today.

60
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,130
Let the girl go.

61
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,380
Even though you're going to die soon,
you still have to act cool.

62
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,840
Too bad, that's not going to work out.

63
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,190
You're going to be drenched in blood and
unable to move a finger because of someone.

64
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,680
The female protagonist has to keep her
eyes open and watch such a momentous scene.

65
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Don't you think so?

66
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,050
Start.

67
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,490
Gu Jun Pyo...

68
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,740
Gu Jun Pyo...

69
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,590
Stop it!

70
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,900
Gu Jun Pyo!

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,110
Stop! Stop! Stop it!
Save him! Someone save him!

72
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,530
<i>Gu Jun Pyo! Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

73
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,730
Stop.

74
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,850
Does it hurt?

75
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,010
Now start begging to live.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,870
Try getting on your knees and cry.

77
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,440
No... Gu Jun Pyo. Don't do it.

78
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,370
Don't do it!

79
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,320
Gu Jun Pyo.

80
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,070
STOP IT!

81
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,690
Now say that you're going
to give up Geum Jan Di.

82
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,680
Hurry up and say it.

83
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,090
I don't think that's possible.

84
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,990
What?

85
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,670
What are you deaf?

86
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,070
I said that's not possible.

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,900
Do you want to die?

88
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,610
I don't want to die.

89
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,650
But if you're going to kill me,
what can I do.

90
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,400
Say it.

91
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,820
Hurry up and say it!

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,540
Geum Jan Di.

93
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,980
Geum Jan Di.

94
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,170
<i>Jun Pyo! Gu Jun Pyo!</i>

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,370
<i>Geum Jan Di!</i>

96
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,820
<i>Gu Jun Pyo.</i>

97
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,380
Go outside.

98
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,980
Jun Pyo, are you okay?

99
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,610
Geum Jan Di... Jan Di...

100
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,911
Geum Jan Di.

101
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,210
Geum Jan Di.

102
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,590
Are you awake?

103
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,930
Gu Jun Pyo.

104
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,570
You idiot.

105
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,980
I thought I was going to
die of shock because of you.

106
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,970
I should be saying that.

107
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,000
You're the real idiot.

108
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,040
Why did you just take the hits?

109
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,890
You said you could take on
ten guys like that and be fine.

110
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,530
Such a liar.

111
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,050
Idiot. Stupid.

112
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,040
Double-digit-IQ dummy

113
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,060
What?

114
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,840
How could I do that when you were captured?

115
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,660
I'd rather have my ribcage broken,

116
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,310
than have those guys touch even your finger.

117
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,400
But when I was purposely
getting beaten to death for you,

118
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,990
why did you butt in?

119
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,700
What if something horrible had happened?

120
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,440
You and your nosiness.

121
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,880
Idiot. Stupid.

122
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,460
Double-digit-IQ dummy.

123
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,820
What?

124
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,720
HEY!

125
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,070
You're always beating patients!

126
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,130
You're always hitting girls!

127
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,660
I'm in pain!

128
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,370
I'm in pain too!

129
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,890
You're always hitting girls...

130
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,420
<i>You're always beating up girls
when you get the chance!</i>

131
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,720
I'm home...

132
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,480
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

133
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,610
What's this?

134
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,920
What happened?

135
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,020
What's all this?

136
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,480
Kang San, stop crying and explain!

137
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,030
The loan sharks took Dad.

138
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,410
What?

139
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,150
Jan Di, what are we going to do?

140
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,710
What if your dad dies?

141
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,310
If we don't pay our debts, they said
they were going to sell his organs.

142
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,740
What if your dad dies?

143
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,780
What are we going to do about your dad?

144
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,380
May I help you?

145
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,800
Yes... I came to see Madam President.

146
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,580
Come this way.

147
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,630
Madam President.

148
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,750
What is your business?

149
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,010
Help us, please.

150
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,640
What are you talking about?

151
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,770
The offer you gave us...
No, even a quarter of that is even fine.

152
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,190
Please save our family.

153
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,480
No matter how hard I thought,

154
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,581
the only person to save our family
was you, Madam President Kang.

155
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,770
So I shamelessly came here.

156
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,550
That doesn't sound like a hard thing.

157
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,170
But in business, there's such a thing
as an orderly procedure.

158
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,620
An orderly procedure?

159
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,170
Wrongs must be apologized for,

160
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:12,671
debts repaid, and
then help rendered.

161
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,020
I'm a businesswoman,
so I cannot abide

162
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:20,121
calculations and procedures
that are not conducted properly.

163
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,310
Yes, that must be done.

164
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,220
Last time, I did something
that was a deadly sin.

165
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,050
I apologize for insulting you
without knowing my place.

166
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,500
Please forgive me.

167
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,180
Ma'am, please don't...

168
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,150
Please forgive me!

169
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,790
I was wrong.

170
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,490
Forgive me, please, forgive me.

171
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,820
Thank you.

172
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,770
Thank you.

173
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,040
I'm home...

174
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,520
Dad!

175
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,590
Dad!

176
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,870
Yeah, Jan Di.

177
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,610
Are you okay? Everything's okay, right?

178
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,450
Of course! It's okay.

179
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,880
That's a relief. I was so worried!

180
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,290
Why is everyone like this?
Dad came back safely...

181
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,160
Did someone die?

182
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,620
Could this be...

183
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,180
It's not could it... it is.

184
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,800
Mom.

185
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,140
What? Should I have left your father to die?

186
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,890
Where were we going to get
this much money immediately?

187
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,380
I said to return the money.

188
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,170
What?

189
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,450
Return it!

190
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,850
No. I can't.

191
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,070
Do you know how I got this money?

192
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,410
And if we return this money, what are
we going to do about the aftermath?

193
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,690
I'll fix it.

194
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,380
I did this to us, so I'll fix it.

195
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,530
I'll do whatever it takes
to repay everything!

196
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,310
Jan Di, take this back.

197
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,180
What are you going to and how?

198
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,470
I said to return it!

199
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,780
If you disobey my words...
then... you're on your own!

200
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,000
It's cold.

201
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,710
You didn't even wear your jacket.

202
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,500
Here.

203
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,520
Hurry.

204
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,790
Jan Di...

205
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,610
Yeah?

206
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,570
You...

207
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,240
Really like Jun Pyo, don't you?

208
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,550
Answer me.

209
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,890
You’re more important, Dad.

210
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,230
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:18,030
I'm sorry for being a burden
on my pretty daughter's love.

212
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,410
Who said anything about love, Dad.

213
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,370
It's love.

214
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,820
This is love, Jan Di.

215
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,470
That makes him as dear a
person to you as your dad.

216
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,080
If I’m not sure of that myself,
how can you know?

217
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,000
I’ve been Dad to my pretty daughter
for 19 years, how could I not know?

218
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,620
Dad!

219
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,630
Madam President.

220
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,500
Geum Jan Di is here to see you.

221
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,510
Oh really?

222
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,130
Welcome. What business do
you have with me?

223
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,960
I came to return the money.

224
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,520
I heard your situation was hard.

225
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,270
Don't you think it's wiser to
not let your pride get in the middle of it?

226
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,390
It's not pride, but the
decision my family made.

227
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,630
Sorry for the trouble.

228
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,960
I can give you more if
the amount is too little.

229
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,170
After seeing you for awhile, you seem
to be skilled in business transactions.

230
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm for it. Let's do it.
Let's make a deal.

231
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,710
From now on, please stop
insulting my family or me.

232
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,990
I'm asking you.

233
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,290
What's this?

234
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,050
Then are you really going
to date my Jun Pyo?

235
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,880
That...

236
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:38,530
Is a matter between Jun Pyo and me,
just the two of us.

237
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,520
All right.

238
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,610
Let's be more honest with each other.

239
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:57,270
I'll admit that I have made things
troublesome for you and your family.

240
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,610
So you should just accept that
you and Jun Pyo are not suitable.

241
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,570
Yes.

242
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:14,650
Jun Pyo and I are so different,
I'll admit that.

243
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,560
But, do you know this?

244
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,660
We're both standing at the same place,
and looking at the same thing.

245
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:38,540
I made a promise with Gu Jun Pyo that we
wouldn't break up because of you.

246
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,410
This money is the price of your mother
kneeling down in front of me.

247
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,040
Are you going to just throw all that away
because of your thoughtless pride?

248
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,710
This is an unprecedented opportunity for
the price of a worthless common family.

249
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,970
Don't you think you'll regret it?

250
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,730
I didn't know pride had a price.

251
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,860
Then, how much is your pride?

252
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,110
Unbelievable...

253
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:24,320
I hope you can change the belief that
you can buy a commoner's pride.

254
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,700
And you can't buy a person's heart, either.

255
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,700
Madam President don't know that, do you?

256
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,710
But Gu Jun Pyo does now.

257
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,580
That's all...

258
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,970
<i>Isn't it funny just imagining it?</i>

259
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,500
<i>Gu Jun Pyo got so furious after
he got his girl stolen by me,</i>

260
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,280
<i>But when he finds out that
his mom paid me to do it...</i>

261
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,520
<i>You called 911?</i>

262
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,370
I came to put out the fire.

263
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,230
They're hotcakes.

264
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:29,900
You need to make it with flour, eggs,
and of course baking powder.

265
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,460
When you're sad, this does wonders.

266
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,610
I ate well.

267
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,590
Then should we get going?

268
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,740
Where?

269
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,890
Hey, make your legs straight

270
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,750
Yeah, like that.

271
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,940
Hey you idiot!

272
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,690
Stupid.

273
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,410
You're so stupid.

274
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,350
It's F4! It's F4

275
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,110
Isn't that... Geum Jan Di?

276
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,970
Let us hurry and tell Jinju!
(Ginger's real Korean name)

277
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,010
What's that?

278
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,830
It's nothing.

279
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,340
What do you mean nothing?

280
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,070
Hey!

281
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,010
I smell whiffs of a proposal
when I look at it.

282
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,460
What do you mean proposal?

283
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,020
She keeps going off and
getting into trouble

284
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:17,321
that I felt that I should give
her a collar or something.

285
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,790
Is Geum Jan Di a pet?

286
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,430
But I worry that with your personality,

287
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:24,531
you won't be able to
deliver it well to Geum Jan Di.

288
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,350
Well he says it's a collar and Geum Jan Di
is not one to take that well.

289
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,830
Maybe we'll see another spin-kick soon.

290
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,400
Geum Jan Di's kick of death?

291
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,300
Now that I think about it,
I do miss it a little.

292
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,530
Can you guys knock it off?
You're so annoying.

293
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,830
A playing fee.

294
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,770
I was going to turn the pages for you,
but you didn't have any sheet music.

295
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,480
Instead, want to do an errand for me?

296
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,180
Hey, Yoon Ji Hoo!

297
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,430
Why do you call a person out into
the cold and treat me like a dog!

298
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,980
Gu Jun Pyo?

299
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,090
Geum Jan Di.

300
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,410
Here.

301
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,420
It's cold. Wear this.

302
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,190
You... put your hand deep
in here and stay still.

303
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,480
There's something in here.

304
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,450
What's this?

305
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,550
Can't you tell? It's a necklace.

306
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,380
Hey! This isn't right!

307
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,760
I know your taste is unique
but this is totally a girl's!

308
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,460
You idiot...

309
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,470
It's yours.

310
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,960
What?

311
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,270
It's yours.

312
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,690
There's only one like it in the world,
so if you lose it,

313
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:51,091
you’re really dead this time.

314
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,680
Only one?

315
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,140
Yeah.

316
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,150
Is there really only one?

317
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,850
Because I personally designed it.

318
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
Look carefully.

319
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,730
This is I.

320
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,850
And the one inside is you.

321
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,900
Why's that?

322
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,500
Why are you the star and I'm the moon?

323
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,540
Because Geum Jan Di

324
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:28,841
is the moon, which can never escape
from the Gu Jun Pyo star.

325
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:39,130
Because whatever may happen,
I'm not going to let go of this moon.

326
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,500
See!

327
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,700
Did something out of character
and you caught a cold.

328
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,030
It's not that I caught a cold.
I just sneezed.

329
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,270
It's cold.

330
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,690
Look over there...

331
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,830
Look at all the twinkling lights!

332
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,020
Isn't that a satellite?

333
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,990
It's pretty.

334
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,900
It really is a one of a kind necklace.

335
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,710
Isn't it a bit too romantic?

336
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,830
Romantic or whatnot,

337
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,060
I hear that and bam! I feel burdened.

338
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,340
Oh, what if I lose it already?
I'm so worried I could die.

339
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,440
- Geez, such happy worries.
- What?

340
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,190
Hey! If someone, saying
"I made it especially for you",

341
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,440
and gave me a one of a kind token of love,

342
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:20,030
even if it were a piece of glass,
I would be so happy.

343
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,110
- Let's go.
- Where to?

344
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,570
What to you mean "where to"?

345
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,410
We have to go ski.

346
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,440
Let's go!

347
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,260
Oh... my... God...

348
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,260
What did she just say?

349
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,680
A one of a kind necklace?

350
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,030
And she got it from Jun Pyo!

351
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,530
Oh, I can't stand this.

352
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,680
I absolutely can't stand this!

353
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,710
Girls, do you think a girl like Geum Jan Di
has a right to get something like that?

354
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,380
No way!

355
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,110
I'm not like this because it isn't me.

356
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,730
Don't you think Geum Jan Di
is just intolerable?

357
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,420
Yeah!

358
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,670
Girls, go on.

359
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,180
Geum Jan Di, you're so dead.

360
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,070
Oww, my stomach hurts...

361
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,350
Jan Di!

362
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,820
Are you OK?

363
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,280
Go on ahead!

364
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,270
Oh, Geum Jan Di!

365
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,350
I didn't know that it was you.

366
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,360
I'm sorry.

367
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,880
Oh, I'm alright.

368
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,040
Are you OK?

369
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,150
Yeah, I'm OK.

370
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,990
You should be careful.

371
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,910
Are you OK?

372
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,050
Are you alright?

373
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,440
I'm fine.

374
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,750
You should be careful!

375
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,290
Be careful!

376
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,390
Are you OK?
You should be careful.

377
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,890
- I'm fine.
- Are you OK?

378
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,930
Get up.

379
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,900
Are you OK?

380
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,640
I'm fine, I'm fine.

381
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,420
It's all right, go. I'm fine.

382
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,900
OK, we're off then.

383
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,690
See ya!

384
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,710
Jan Di, are you OK?

385
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,890
Yeah, I'm fine.

386
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,080
How about you?

387
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,750
Oh, Ga Eul!

388
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,250
Ga Eul, look out!

389
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,770
Ga Eul, are you OK?

390
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,100
Wake up!

391
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,120
Do you hear me?

392
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,610
Ga Eul!

393
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,580
Ga Eul...

394
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,630
Are you OK?

395
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,610
Honey, about that...

396
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,830
Fine, I take responsibility for it.

397
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,600
So don't you say anything.
Understand?

398
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,340
What's important now isn't you or me!

399
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,600
Are you just going to
give up Shinhwa like this?

400
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,630
Given how your father built...

401
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,030
Honey...?

402
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,910
Honey?!

403
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,530
Madam President...

404
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,370
The situation is not good.

405
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,410
Jun Pyo...

406
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,120
For now, please find Jun Pyo.

407
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,600
He needs to fly over there
with me immediately.

408
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,350
I understand.

409
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,020
Here, this has more chocolate.

410
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,130
Jan Di...

411
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,010
Where's your necklace?

412
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,010
The necklace is...

413
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,170
The necklace!

414
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,740
Hey...

415
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,350
Where could the necklace be...?

416
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,390
What's with you guys?

417
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,750
Sunbae, by any chance, did you
give Geum Jan Di a necklace?

418
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,180
How do you guys know about that?

419
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,430
A moon within a star...
that's right, isn't it?

420
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,150
I asked how you guys knew that!

421
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,820
You should ask Geum Jan Di
if she still has it.

422
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,860
What?

423
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,240
Not sure if she dropped it or threw it away,

424
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:50,441
but she probably lost it
on the mountain earlier.

425
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:56,510
How can she so carelessly lose your heart?

426
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,950
They say that one thing reveals ten more.

427
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,330
Geum Jan Di takes Sunbae for granted... Oww!

428
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,590
Geum Jan Di, now you're dead!

429
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,680
Did you lose something?

430
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,700
Huh?

431
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,440
Uh... I just wanted to organize my stuff.

432
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,240
The necklace... Why aren't you wearing it?

433
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,310
The necklace...?

434
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,110
The thing is...

435
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,990
Gu Jun Pyo, I'm sorry.

436
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,660
I definitely had it on.
I don't know when I lost it.

437
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,740
I really don't know.

438
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,320
And it's not that you wanted to lose it?

439
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,040
What?

440
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,410
You do this every time.

441
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,360
Whenever I try to get closer to you.

442
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,460
You trample on my heart like it’s nothing.

443
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,480
Do I still mean so little to you?

444
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,410
Gu Jun Pyo, don't misunderstand!

445
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,280
It's really not like that.

446
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,570
- It's really not...
- A girl like you...

447
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,310
really knows how to wear a person out.

448
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,460
Idiot!

449
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,840
Moron!

450
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,260
Dummy!

451
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,020
Die!

452
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,880
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

453
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,340
Do you know how expensive that piece was?

454
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,840
I got you a one of a kind...

455
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,030
What's this?

456
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,160
We have an order from Madam
President to bring you home immediately.

457
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,210
Don't want to.

458
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,170
Young Master, the President...

459
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,220
I don't care what the
Evil Witch said, I'm not going.

460
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,340
Convey that to her.

461
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,010
Let go.

462
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,390
- You won't let go?
- I'm sorry.

463
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,870
<i>Young Master, the President...</i>

464
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,890
I said I'm not going!

465
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,240
I said I'm not going.

466
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,730
Let's go.

467
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,460
Better let go.

468
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,180
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

469
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,920
<i>Due to the heavy snowstorm in
the Kyunggi Kangwon area,</i>

470
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:20,121
<i>all roads and transportation
have been shut down.</i>

471
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,740
We've got a big problem!

472
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,750
Ga Eul!

473
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,040
What's the matter now?

474
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,430
Jan Di...

475
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,980
Jan Di went up the mountain...

476
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,650
<i>As soon as I find the necklace,
I'll be back. -Jan Di-</i>

477
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,980
Necklace?

478
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,560
Where's Jun Pyo right now?

479
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,000
Privacy.

480
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,001
<i>{\a6}A note to the driver for
privacy to not listen to his call.</i>

481
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,720
Yo...

482
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,760
Some irritating matter came...

483
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,520
What?

484
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,210
I need to use the restroom.

485
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:39,690
<i>Geum Jan Di!</i>

486
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,010
By any chance, did you
lose a star necklace?

487
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,350
How did you know that?

488
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,880
So it was yours...

489
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,150
Do you want me to tell you where it is?

490
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,710
A cabin cafe worker picked
it up during the day

491
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,110
and left a memo saying he'll hold onto it

492
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,700
<i>Go and see.</i>

493
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,490
Really?

494
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,640
Where do I need to go? This way?

495
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,870
Thanks!

496
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,430
Now what?

497
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,620
It's getting worse and worse.

498
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:13,300
If this keeps up, it's not like
something bad will really happen, right?

499
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,380
Something bad? What?

500
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,630
This is something she had coming to her.

501
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:25,410
How can a commoner like her get our Jun Pyo
sunbae's one and only token of love!

502
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,410
That's right. If she had
only known her place,

503
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:32,311
we wouldn't have done
something like this.

504
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,660
"Something like this" - what?

505
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,790
Ji Hoo sunbae!

506
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,760
What did you guys do to Jan Di?

507
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
<i>[Men's Restroom]</i>

508
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,060
You're going to follow me into the restroom?

509
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,340
Isn't he taking too long to come out?

510
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,310
<i>Geum Jan Di, looking for the necklace,
went up the mountain alone.</i>

511
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,330
<i>Gu Jun Pyo, do you hear me?</i>

512
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:55,030
<i>Geum Jan Di. I can't help but to
think that she's in an accident.</i>

513
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,070
STOP!!!!

514
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,050
There’s only one like it in the world,
so if you lose it,

515
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,960
you’re really dead this time.

516
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,970
The only one?

517
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,820
This is I.

518
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,320
And the one inside is you.

519
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:55,980
Why's that?

520
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,350
Why are you the star and I'm the moon?

521
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,620
Because Geum Jan Di

522
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:07,021
is the moon, which can never escape
from the Gu Jun Pyo star.

523
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:46,120
<i>Geum Jan Di, don't worry.</i>

524
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,200
<i>You can never escape from me.</i>

525
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,180
Geum Jan Di!

526
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,360
Jan Di!

527
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:16,530
Answer me!

528
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,550
Geum Jan Di!

529
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,390
Jan Di!

530
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,500
Geum Jan Di!

531
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,600
Hey...

532
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,800
Geum Jan Di...

533
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,620
Wake up.

534
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,560
Jan Di...

535
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,680
Gu Jun Pyo...

536
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,200
Yeah... it's me, Gu Jun Pyo.

537
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,290
Are you coming around?

538
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,010
I... I came to look for your heart.

539
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,430
I didn't lose it on purpose.

540
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,660
Hey you idiot, who told you
to do something like this!

541
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,530
Do you think you can stand up?

542
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,820
Get on.

543
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,350
Jan Di...

544
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,260
Do you hear me?

545
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,950
Hey, you can't lose consciousness!

546
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,860
Hey, Geum Jan Di!

547
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,860
Because of the weather conditions, the
rescue team said it'll be too difficult.

548
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:54,060
- Ji Hoo, where are you going?
- I can't leave it alone like this.

549
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,340
Do you want to make
this problem bigger?

550
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:57,041
The road's blocked
you can't even approach it.

551
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,120
Geum Jan Di...!

552
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,300
Jan Di's out there.

553
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,750
She's out there alone in the snow.

554
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,990
- Let go!
- Ji Hoo...

555
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,910
Calm down.

556
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,800
Jan Di, are you OK?

557
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,380
Geum Jan Di!

558
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,300
Jan Di, are you OK?

559
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,960
Geum Jan Di...

560
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,000
Geum Jan Di!

561
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:15,080
- What are you doing?
- You have to take this off.

562
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,560
- It's dirty?
- Take everything off.

563
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,920
Ah, Jun Pyo...

564
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,720
If you don't, then you'll die!

565
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,790
Do you want to freeze and die because
of your stupid stubbornness?

566
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:27,410
There's no use trying to resist.

567
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,080
Because I'm not going to let you die.

568
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,720
Don't worry. It's OK.

569
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,150
It's going to be all right.

570
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,950
I’ll protect you.

571
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,630
Hurry up.

572
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,500
I'm sorry.

573
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,190
If you're are sorry, that's good enough.

574
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:44,160
Don’t forget I saved your life this time.

575
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,770
How should I repay you?

576
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,630
A lunchbox.

577
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,980
Hm?

578
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,600
There's that thing you eat every day.

579
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,040
The rolled up egg?

580
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,720
That...

581
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,490
Actually...

582
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,590
the first time I saw it,
I wanted to try it.

583
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,730
Why are you laughing?

584
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,650
Because I'm wondering
if this is the Gu Jun Pyo I know.

585
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,720
Are you teasing me right now?

586
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,480
I'll make it for you.

587
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,080
Let's make lunchboxes and go
on a picnic... The two of us.

588
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,980
The two of us.

589
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,910
Jan Di!

590
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,820
Jun Pyo!

591
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,190
Jun Pyo, are you OK?

592
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,180
Hey, are you guys OK?

593
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,920
Yeah, we're fine.

594
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:46,260
<i>Shinhwa Group Chairman Gu Bon Hyung

Get on quickly!

604
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,850
Why? What's the matter?

605
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,640
It's urgent.

606
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:29,290
What?

607
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,700
We have to hurry if you're to see Jun Pyo.

608
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,400
Sunbae...

609
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,000
Everything's is ready.

610
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,470
Madam President.

611
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,350
<i>They said that Jun Pyo's father collapsed.</i>

612
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,070
<i>What?</i>

613
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,650
<i>The plane's taking off in 30 minutes.</i>

614
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,370
But I have yet to thank him.

615
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:21,100
And I have yet to tell him that I like him.

616
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,290
<i>I'll be back soon.</i>

617
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,590

618
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,780
<i>I love you... Geum Jan Di.</i>
