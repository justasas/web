{\a6}Episode 22

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,169
Then, tell me not to do it.

5
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:12,531
Tell me not to go.

6
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:36,048
Miss Jae Kyung is looking
for Miss Geum Jan Di.

7
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,974
The groom is taking too long.

8
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:41,021
Here comes the groom.

9
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:41,242
Here comes the bride.

10
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,796
We shall begin...

11
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:41,075
with the holy matrimony of the groom,
Gu Jun Pyo, and bride, Ha Jae Kyung.

12
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,468
Marriage is...

13
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:58,662
a sacred oath between two people,
in front of those whom you love and cherish.

14
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:07,539
If anyone objects to this marriage,
please speak now.

15
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:14,144
Or forever hold your peace.

16
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,835
The Lord...

17
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:23,836
What is she doing?

18
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,152
What are you doing right now?

19
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,848
I...

20
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,067
I object to this wedding.

21
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,645
Jae Kyung!

22
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:36,992
Jae Kyung, what do you
think you're doing?!

23
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:47,043
I, the bride, Ha Jae Kyung,
object to this wedding.

24
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:48,177
W-what?

25
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:54,150
Is there anyone else who objects?

26
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,487
I also object.

27
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,483
I object as well.

28
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:01,894
I do too.

29
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:04,570
Me too.

30
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,021
I object as well.

31
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:09,156
Huh? What is this...

32
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:10,480
Jae Kyung.

33
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,717
I think this joke is too much.

34
00:06:13,837 --> 00:06:15,406
It's good to have fun, but...

35
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:16,800
President...

36
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,660
Also Mom and Dad...

37
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:21,532
This isn't a joke.

38
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,389
I...

39
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:27,102
can't marry Gu Jun Pyo.

40
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:39,391
No matter how I look at it, I don't think
I'm ready for marriage right now.

41
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:43,926
I'm sorry.

42
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,598
To cause so much trouble for my fickleness.

43
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:51,134
Dad.

44
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:56,526
Everything is my fault, so please
continue your business with Shinhwa Group.

45
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:01,946
President Kang...

46
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,573
and...

47
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:06,009
Gu Jun Pyo...

48
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,730
I'm truly sorry.

49
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,932
Please forgive me.

50
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,857
I can't believe this.

51
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,293
What's going on?

52
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,780
I've always been a pretty cool person.

53
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:44,615
Unni!

54
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:50,936
Oh yeah, Chen...

55
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,123
Chen, what happened?

56
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:01,734
We're taking her there right now.

57
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,036
Gu Jun Pyo.

58
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,622
Jan Di.

59
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,256
How long are you going to cry?

60
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:36,839
If someone saw you...

61
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,917
They might think you're in mourning.

62
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:43,001
Can anything be any
more moving than that?

63
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:49,820
Jae Kyung unni is so cool.

64
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,031
That day...

65
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,774
You asked why I didn't
go that day, right?

66
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,107
I...

67
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,311
don't believe in happy endings.

68
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:12,893
Ah!

69
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:17,484
Are you okay?

70
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:35,709
This is why I always
tell you to be careful!

71
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,414
Sorry.

72
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:39,355
I'm okay.

73
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,916
You have guests, so I'll leave.

74
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:08,333
Weren't you waiting because
you'd something to tell me?

75
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:17,271
I have a favor to ask.

76
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,104
Jan Di...

77
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:00,255
I can't let her go.

78
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:05,701
Rather than making things hard for her.

79
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,947
I'd thought it might be
better to send her to you.

80
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:14,099
I didn't even want to imagine it,
but if I had to...

81
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:20,105
I thought the other person has to be you.

82
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:25,497
You were the only one it could be, Ji Hoo.
That's what I thought.

83
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:26,726
Gu Jun Pyo!

84
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:28,716
But still, I can't do it.

85
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,968
The grass lawn here is still the same.

86
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,058
I missed it.

87
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,879
Don't you regret it?

88
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,216
How can I not?

89
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,969
The moment I let Gu Jun Pyo go,
I've been regretting it terribly.

90
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:52,125
I was rooting for you, Ji Hoo.

91
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,512
But now that I've given up...

92
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,661
I can't even do that anymore.

93
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,857
Not so long ago...

94
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:06,908
I asked Jun this...

95
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,910
Between friendship and love...

96
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:13,297
If he could only choose one...

97
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:16,425
Which one would he choose?

98
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,363
He said he wouldn't give
up either one of them.

99
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:31,002
There's a saying that people generally
get as much as they strive for.

100
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,542
Neither you nor I are ambitious enough.

101
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:44,936
I'm leaving for New York tomorrow.

102
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:53,835
Can you give this to Jan Di for me?

103
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:02,724
That J J...

104
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:07,770
How much I'd hoped it stood
for Ji Hoo and Jan Di.

105
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:13,178
Ji Hoo, you probably didn't realize it.

106
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,873
Good luck.

107
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:28,776
Take care.

108
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:29,973
She prepared it so you both could
spend the night comfortably.

109
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:31,098
Then...

110
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:33,222
Excuse me.

111
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,892
Please deliver this message
to Jae Kyung unni.

112
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,631
If it's okay with her...

113
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,203
that nothing has changed
with me being her dongseng.

114
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:01,036
Eat.

115
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,905
Miss Geum Jan Di.

116
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:52,609
Would you like to dance with me?

117
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,491
I can't dance.

118
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:25,916
<i>I've been wanting to ask
you this for a while.</i>

119
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,500
<i>What is it?</i>

120
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:31,169
<i>Why me?</i>

121
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:37,166
<i>I'm not pretty, and I don't have
money or status. I have nothing.</i>

122
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,815
<i>Why did you like me?</i>

123
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,739
<i>Because I have all that.</i>

124
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:44,188
<i>What?</i>

125
00:21:44,745 --> 00:21:47,997
<i>Money, status, looks...</i>

126
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:50,137
<i>Because I have all that.</i>

127
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,419
<i>I don't need that from you.</i>

128
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:56,917
<i>Geum Jan Di, all you have
to be is Geum Jan Di.</i>

129
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,518
<i>Wow, it's really pretty.</i>

130
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:11,085
Do you see the brightest
star over there?

131
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,234
Yeah.

132
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,445
It's the Sirius star,
aka Orion's big dog.

133
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:21,254
The brightest star in the winter sky.

134
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:25,176
You can say that its existence
is very like Gu Jun Pyo.

135
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:26,766
What?

136
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:30,031
Then I am... That one.

137
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:31,343
That one. That one. That one.

138
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:33,228
I want to be that one.

139
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:36,009
You sure do know how to pick them.

140
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:40,255
That's the second
brightest star, Procyon.

141
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,050
Fine, I'll be nice.

142
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:46,645
Always wandering all over
the place and barking non stop...

143
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:47,892
It fits you perfectly.

144
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:49,182
What?

145
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,299
But...

146
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:59,816
How did you come to like stars?

147
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:08,960
When I was young...

148
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,694
My dad sent me a telescope for my birthday.

149
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:15,858
He wrote on the card,

150
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:22,894
"Study the stars well, so we can
go watch them together next time."

151
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:26,580
So you went to watch
the stars with your dad?

152
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,419
No.

153
00:23:29,162 --> 00:23:29,936
Huh?

154
00:23:30,056 --> 00:23:31,902
We never went, not even once.

155
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,476
Why not?

156
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:36,630
Believing in that promise...

157
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,613
I studied so hard, I could
have become an astronomer.

158
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:45,136
Do you know what I got for
Christmas a few years later?

159
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:49,793
Another telescope.

160
00:23:53,928 --> 00:24:04,670
That's when I realized he didn't send the first
gift or the card, but that his secretary did.

161
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:12,757
Do you know what my dream is?

162
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:18,002
Going to watch the stars with your son.

163
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,952
You're so simple-minded.

164
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:26,491
To not make promises I won't keep.

165
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:31,783
Jan Di.

166
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,148
Yeah?

167
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:36,891
I'm sorry for hurting you.

168
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:40,874
Jan Di.

169
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:43,207
What now?

170
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:49,708
I love you.

171
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:37,835
I can see love is in the air.

172
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,918
When did you get here?

173
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:42,998
Jan Di!

174
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:44,350
Ga Eul!

175
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,462
Why do you need that?

176
00:25:57,582 --> 00:25:59,111
That's what I am saying.

177
00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:21,254
It's a relief.

178
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:23,019
What is?

179
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:24,691
You're smiling.

180
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,403
Here.

181
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:42,423
This is...

182
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:45,488
I don't know why she had it. But...

183
00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:47,621
She asked me to give it to you.

184
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:51,193
What about Unni?
Where is she right now?

185
00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:56,884
She's going to leave soon.

186
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:09,753
Miss, it's time to go in now.

187
00:28:21,555 --> 00:28:22,960
Unni! Jae Kyung unni.

188
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,120
Hey, Monkey!

189
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:26,541
Jan Di!

190
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:27,768
Gu Jun Pyo!

191
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,010
How did you get here?

192
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,117
How can you leave like this?

193
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,876
You weren't going to say
goodbye to your dongseng?

194
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,476
How can a big sister act like that?

195
00:28:42,414 --> 00:28:43,481
Sorry.

196
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,783
Honestly, I'm really
bad at saying goodbye.

197
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:51,865
So the fierce Ha Jae Kyung
has a weakness too?

198
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:53,281
That's right.

199
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:57,632
Take care.

200
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:00,008
And...

201
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:02,438
Thanks.

202
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:10,625
If you guys break up, I'm going
to feel so wronged, I'll die.

203
00:29:10,745 --> 00:29:14,776
So if you want to break up, report
to me first and get my approval.

204
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:16,111
Understand?

205
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,391
Unni.

206
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:26,643
Let me give you a hug,
my Jan Di dongseng.

207
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:41,346
I have to go.

208
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:01,779
Have an enjoyable flight.

209
00:30:36,531 --> 00:30:37,719
This is mine.

210
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:39,951
I picked it out first.

211
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,017
I had dibs on it first.

212
00:30:42,137 --> 00:30:44,014
Better let it go now.

213
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,161
What's up with you?

214
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:48,039
Hey!

215
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,224
Say that you’re sorry right now, jerk!

216
00:30:50,344 --> 00:30:51,406
Get off me!

217
00:30:51,526 --> 00:30:53,274
Apologize, quickly!

218
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:34,380
<i>I know these were Jan Di’s originally.</i>

219
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:37,095
<i>But let me have just this one...</i>

220
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:40,580
<i>Give me just this one thing.</i>

221
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:46,955
<i>Don't you think I should have at
least one memory to cherish as well?</i>

222
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:58,391
As complications arise between
Shinhwa Group and JK Group merger,

223
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:02,931
the international markets are
focusing their attentions on them.

224
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:07,585
In an effort to minimize the negative reaction
toward the cancelled marriage between

225
00:32:07,705 --> 00:32:11,199
Shinhwa Group and American-based
JK Group, Shinhwa Group is...

226
00:32:34,813 --> 00:32:37,220
Hey, open up.

227
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:39,530
Hey.

228
00:32:41,488 --> 00:32:42,787
<i>Open the door!</i>

229
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:47,378
I said to open the door!

230
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:51,644
Hey, do you not hear me?

231
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:54,075
I said to open the door!

232
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,615
Don't you think you should come
over to my place this time?

233
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:00,753
What's the point of finding
another house again?

234
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:05,963
You don't know if that witch will demolish it
or kick you out in the middle of the night.

235
00:33:07,918 --> 00:33:10,770
I need to pack all my stuff right away.

236
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,881
It's really a big problem.

237
00:33:13,321 --> 00:33:15,082
<i>There's no need to do that.</i>

238
00:33:26,268 --> 00:33:28,488
I knew you were pathetic,

239
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:29,775
but I didn't take you for a child

240
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:32,740
who'd act innocent and then
pull this stunt behind our backs.

241
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:34,704
I’m truly at loss for words.

242
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:39,871
It was my mistake for not getting rid of the
roots of evil like you from the beginning.

243
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:41,272
How much I regret that mistake.

244
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:42,368
Excuse me.

245
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:44,263
Why are you acting like this to my Jan Di?

246
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:46,030
Jan Di didn't do anything.

247
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:48,650
She even try to help them
out with their relationship.

248
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,807
If you have eyes, then look at that.

249
00:33:56,199 --> 00:34:02,699
<i>{\a6}[Shocking engagement cancellation!
JK Group & Shinhwa Group merger scrapped.]</i>

250
00:33:56,199 --> 00:34:02,699
<i>[Indications of Shinhwa Group's stock
price crashing, could this be the 2nd crisis?]</i>

251
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:07,398
Do you know how much has been lost
because of a worthless child like you?

252
00:34:07,518 --> 00:34:10,880
The scale and amount of the damage caused
cannot be comprehended by the likes of you.

253
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:14,384
Take a look at what you've done to our family!

254
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:18,317
I'll not let this matter slide by.

255
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,695
It's best for you not

256
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:23,921
to expect me to let this go easily.

257
00:34:24,191 --> 00:34:27,145
I'll make you realize exactly
who you're messing with.

258
00:34:27,146 --> 00:34:30,260
And make sure you
regret it to its fullest.

259
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,030
Isn't this what you wanted?!

260
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:35,434
Really!

261
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,402
Those words are too harsh for a child!

262
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:40,655
Grandpa!

263
00:34:41,685 --> 00:34:44,431
Sir, what brings you here?

264
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,853
It's been a long while, Hee Soo.

265
00:34:48,117 --> 00:34:50,847
Or should I call you President Kang?

266
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,342
You sure have changed a lot.

267
00:34:57,493 --> 00:35:00,322
Let's talk about us later.

268
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:02,751
First, let's discuss about that child.

269
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,884
How do you know that child, Sir?

270
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,793
She is going to become my granddaughter.

271
00:35:09,922 --> 00:35:11,757
What do you mean?

272
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:14,300
She’s the child that I've my sight set

273
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:16,477
on for becoming a partner for my Ji Hoo.

274
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,377
Grandpa...

275
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:20,927
Are you serious?

276
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:24,368
Up until now, I've only
watched from the sideline.

277
00:35:24,713 --> 00:35:28,632
But now she's no different
from my family.

278
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:32,180
So I'd like ask that you don't
deal with her so harshly.

279
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:39,802
Jan Di, what are you doing?

280
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:41,985
Get your bags and follow me!

281
00:35:42,463 --> 00:35:44,528
Y-Yes.

282
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,020
Sunbae.

283
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,305
She'll be staying with
us from today on.

284
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,505
What?

285
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,670
Ji Hoo, what are you doing?

286
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:18,374
You should show her the room.

287
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:21,863
Alright, then.

288
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:42,446
I came because Grandpa
dragged me here.

289
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:47,279
But I can go to
Ga Eul’s house tomorrow.

290
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:53,985
You kids!

291
00:36:54,105 --> 00:36:58,697
Who said you two grown kids can be
alone in a room with the door closed?

292
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:02,496
Grandpa.

293
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:03,550
I'm sorry.

294
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,128
And I thank you.

295
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:07,210
I'm just going to stay for tonight
and...

296
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,616
Don't you dare think
about running away.

297
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:11,427
There’s no need to
be thankful either.

298
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:15,528
You're the one who shoved me into this
house with that child over there.

299
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:18,816
I brought you here because you're
impertinent and I want to punish you.

300
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:19,528
What?!

301
00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:21,975
Do you know how hard
to always watch how

302
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:25,768
you act and speak in
front of your grandchild?

303
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:29,412
But Grandpa and Sunbae...

304
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:34,454
If you've started something, then
you should finish it through to the end.

305
00:37:38,846 --> 00:37:40,211
But Gra...

306
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:24,170
Jan Di might be
uncomfortable staying here.

307
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:27,213
It's not you, who's uncomfortable?

308
00:38:30,762 --> 00:38:35,363
I don't know anything about how
you guys feel towards each other.

309
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:38,868
It'll probably depend on destiny.

310
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:44,731
But that child has nowhere to go.

311
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:48,635
So I want to provide her
the roof over her head.

312
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:53,604
There's no need to like her
or feel uncomfortable.

313
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:56,351
But I am against a bright
girl like Jan Di...

314
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:03,231
being together with someone
so brusque like you.

315
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:27,937
<i>When I think about it,</i>

316
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:31,157
<i>it was the first time
Eun Jae'd ever asked a favor.</i>

317
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,432
<i>Do you know what...
I was doing that night?</i>

318
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,678
I have a favor.

319
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:42,054
Favor?

320
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:53,372
Go to the location written on
there by 7:00 am tomorrow.

321
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,262
Don't ask the reason.

322
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:58,807
Cha Eun Jae.

323
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:01,689
What is this?

324
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,200
I'm going to go.

325
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:15,300
Yi Jung.
I really... hope that you’ll come.

326
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:53,620
<i>[Mom]</i>

327
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,032
What is it now?

328
00:41:06,407 --> 00:41:07,716
A family trip?

329
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:13,663
What's the point of
dragging him into it?

330
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:20,475
Mom, can’t you just
let him go now?

331
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:27,524
Please. Just give up now!

332
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:21,273
Please come with me.

333
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,962
Actually, I have a request...

334
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:41,261
A favor.

335
00:42:41,564 --> 00:42:43,555
Favor?

336
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:58,565
As a part time job.

337
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,550
Will you come and act as his
companion whenever you've time?

338
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,161
M-Me?

339
00:43:07,122 --> 00:43:12,169
All you have to do is tell him stories
or show him your face once in a while.

340
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:16,779
Who is this person?

341
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:21,574
He’s like an older brother
to me, just like family.

342
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:24,756
I see.

343
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:29,035
B-But why are you asking me...

344
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:33,870
Because this person needs
someone with a warm spirit.

345
00:43:35,786 --> 00:43:41,387
Jan Di is the warmest person
I've ever met in life...

346
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:44,415
Would it be sufficient as an answer?

347
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:50,506
Of course, I'll pay you for your time.

348
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,330
Oh, no need.

349
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:55,245
If I can be of any help,
then I'd definitely do it.

350
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:59,690
This is a personal request.

351
00:44:00,297 --> 00:44:03,179
So you must not mention it to
the President or Young Master.

352
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:04,948
Sure.

353
00:44:05,269 --> 00:44:06,179
Okay.

354
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:14,642
Hello.

355
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:16,057
Nice to meet you.

356
00:44:16,177 --> 00:44:17,793
My name is Geum Jan Di.

357
00:44:17,913 --> 00:44:22,329
Although I’m lacking in many ways,
I’ll become a good companion to you.

358
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:26,585
Let's try our best starting today.

359
00:44:26,709 --> 00:44:28,057
Fighting!

360
00:44:28,538 --> 00:44:29,652
<i>Fighting...</i>

361
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:31,310
Fighting!

362
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:24,047
Young Master.

363
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:26,440
What happened to Jan Di?

364
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:27,702
Is she alright?

365
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:30,604
Professor Yoon has taken
her to his house.

366
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:31,957
To Ji Hoo's house?

367
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:36,279
For now, that's the safest
place for her to stay.

368
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,126
Let me borrow your cell phone.

369
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:13,009
<i>[I’m relieved knowing that
she’s staying at your house.]</i>

370
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,240
Jun Pyo...

371
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:34,616
But why do I feel so unease?

372
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:39,369
I feel afraid.

373
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,900
<i>[Gu Jun Pyo]</i>

374
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:05,607
<i>The number you called is not
answering. To leave a message...</i>

375
00:47:21,098 --> 00:47:22,627
Jan Di.

376
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:25,829
Woo Bin sunbae!

377
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:39,224
I feel like dying these days.

378
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:42,626
Yi Jung goes around
like he's an invalid.

379
00:47:42,746 --> 00:47:44,921
Jun Pyo is locked up.

380
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:47,510
It's so stressful.

381
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:50,342
Look, even my skin's suffering.

382
00:47:52,027 --> 00:47:53,896
Hey, don't worry too much.

383
00:47:54,016 --> 00:47:55,337
It's nothing too serious.

384
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,295
He's just not allowed to go out.

385
00:47:57,952 --> 00:48:01,205
He messed up the wedding
in front of that great person.

386
00:48:01,508 --> 00:48:03,463
It'd be strange if there
wasn't any consequence.

387
00:48:05,638 --> 00:48:08,133
I'm going to visit Jun Pyo.

388
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:10,610
Do you have any message
you want me to pass on?

389
00:48:14,082 --> 00:48:15,893
How about Jan Di, are you alright?

390
00:48:17,932 --> 00:48:21,235
I'm doing very well.

391
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:24,503
What?

392
00:48:24,623 --> 00:48:26,042
Why are you looking at me like that?

393
00:48:26,565 --> 00:48:27,610
It's just...

394
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:33,025
You and Ji Hoo both seem so at ease,
with you staying at his house.

395
00:48:34,267 --> 00:48:37,574
Geum Jan Di, Gu Jun Pyo,
and Yoon Ji Hoo...

396
00:48:37,694 --> 00:48:41,589
I don't know what kind of
fate awaits for the three of you.

397
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,486
But my life's a bit
complicated too lately.

398
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,923
I'm just saying.

399
00:48:50,968 --> 00:48:52,687
Hang in there, Geum Jan Di.

400
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:56,257
And, thanks.

401
00:48:56,385 --> 00:48:57,649
For what?

402
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,099
Ji Hoo.

403
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:02,773
I’ve never seen him looking so
relaxed as he has been these days.

404
00:49:03,497 --> 00:49:05,069
And finding his grandfather for him too.

405
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:06,501
It's all thanks to you.

406
00:49:06,788 --> 00:49:08,136
No.

407
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:12,383
Of late, I'm the one
who's being a burden.

408
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:21,650
Okay, let's clean your hand.

409
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,000
It feels good, doesn't it?

410
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:43,992
The most unfortunate encounters are
like those with fish bones.

411
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:47,189
The longer the encounter, the more
the fishy smell sticks with you.

412
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:53,429
Encounters to be most cautious about
are like a flower blossom.

413
00:49:53,826 --> 00:49:57,837
Because it brings exuberance during
full bloom, but gets discarded when wilted.

414
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:04,610
The most beautiful encounters are
like those with handkerchiefs.

415
00:50:06,144 --> 00:50:08,970
They wipe away your sweat
when you're tired,

416
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:12,848
and your tears when you're sad.

417
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,685
I really like this verse.

418
00:50:51,094 --> 00:50:53,780
Encounters like a handkerchief.

419
00:50:57,875 --> 00:51:00,252
What do you think, Mister?

420
00:51:01,817 --> 00:51:06,328
I hope to be like a handkerchief
type of person for you.

421
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:07,648
Right?

422
00:51:08,777 --> 00:51:10,699
Right, Mister?

423
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:19,434
Then...
Let me read you something else.

424
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:01,622
Want me to do it for you?

425
00:52:01,926 --> 00:52:02,869
Huh?

426
00:52:03,847 --> 00:52:06,421
No, it's okay.

427
00:52:06,825 --> 00:52:08,665
If I leave it to you...

428
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:10,880
you'd not be able to go to
school from tomorrow on.

429
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:38,303
You can't cut it there...

430
00:52:38,423 --> 00:52:40,713
I don't need my hair cut in the back!

431
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,479
Not in the back...

432
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,847
Let me help you.

433
00:53:20,603 --> 00:53:21,495
It's okay.

434
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,081
I'll do it.

435
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:28,373
You have to let me repay you
for cutting my hair.

436
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:06,931
It's a car wash!

437
00:54:07,622 --> 00:54:09,881
Hey, it's a car wash!

438
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,987
I wanted to tell you.

439
00:54:47,453 --> 00:54:49,004
That I...

440
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:57,002
love you.

441
00:55:03,861 --> 00:55:05,850
I wanted to shout it aloud.

442
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:08,253
That's all.

443
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:51,849
Are you just going to give up?

444
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:54,565
Are you really going to
run away like this?!

445
00:55:55,357 --> 00:55:57,350
Do you think this is
what she wanted?

446
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:58,584
It doesn't matter anymore.

447
00:55:58,704 --> 00:56:00,719
It matters to me!

448
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:04,364
In order to have a heart that's strong,
and will not break easily...

449
00:56:04,484 --> 00:56:06,674
It has to be turned
upside down, stepped on,

450
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:08,900
and able to withstand
the heat in a kiln.

451
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,066
That's what you said.

452
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,636
You said that that's the only way
you won't have any regrets, Sunbae!

453
00:56:13,756 --> 00:56:15,357
I must’ve been talking crap.

454
00:56:19,193 --> 00:56:20,777
It's not over yet.

455
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:22,968
You haven't done everything yet!

456
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,142
I won't give up like this.

457
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:28,871
This hand. I'm going to make
it move again at all costs.

458
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:43,653
Hurry and leave.

459
00:56:43,939 --> 00:56:44,900
Just this once.

460
00:56:45,186 --> 00:56:46,939
Go over there!

461
00:57:44,491 --> 00:57:46,446
Thank you.

462
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:50,121
Goodbye!

463
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,759
Hey, Ga Eul!

464
00:57:56,343 --> 00:57:57,225
What's wrong?

465
00:57:57,226 --> 00:57:58,800
Hey. Are you okay?

466
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:03,639
Hey, what on earth have
you been up to lately?

467
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:07,125
You don't sleep at night, and I heard
you come to work really early too.

468
00:58:08,406 --> 00:58:10,715
Tell me. What's wrong with you?

469
00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:15,046
Is it something
I can help you with?

470
00:58:15,795 --> 00:58:17,800
Don't worry.

471
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:22,372
Just a little bit more,
and it'll be over.

472
00:58:22,772 --> 00:58:24,272
Huh?

473
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:28,002
Are you ready?

474
00:58:28,356 --> 00:58:28,656
Yeah.

475
00:58:28,776 --> 00:58:31,260
Okay. Let's move out.

476
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:37,613
1...2...3!

477
00:58:43,504 --> 00:58:45,416
I'm going out with my friend.

478
00:58:45,736 --> 00:58:47,436
I don't care if you are
going to follow us or not.

479
00:58:47,556 --> 00:58:49,933
Then, we will follow you.

480
00:59:01,963 --> 00:59:04,828
Representative Lee.
You're ready, right?

481
00:59:20,409 --> 00:59:21,777
Move your car!

482
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:22,866
What the hell is this?!

483
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:26,428
You almost caused an accident!

484
00:59:29,178 --> 00:59:30,609
Don't worry, just go.

485
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:32,462
I'll take good care of him.

486
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:34,755
Mommy will be back later.
Have fun with Noona, okay.

487
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:35,750
I'll leave him to you.

488
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:37,035
Say, goodbye Mommy.

489
00:59:37,036 --> 00:59:38,450
Bye Mommy!

490
00:59:38,557 --> 00:59:39,703
Bye!

491
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:43,049
Let's have fun with Noona, okay?

492
00:59:44,495 --> 00:59:46,233
Hold on a second.

493
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:48,997
Gu Jun Pyo!

494
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:50,415
Are you okay?

495
00:59:52,788 --> 00:59:54,473
R-Right now?

496
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:22,769
I'm so tired!

497
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,137
What's that thing?

498
01:00:30,182 --> 01:00:31,882
It's not a thing, but a child.

499
01:00:32,002 --> 01:00:34,891
How long since we last been on a date,
and you drag along this rug rat?!

500
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:37,908
Did you adopt him from somewhere?

501
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,610
Noona, let's go over there. Yeah?

502
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:42,947
Alright, let's go.

503
01:00:43,992 --> 01:00:46,966
I wondered why all of a sudden,
you want to meet at the zoo.

504
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:49,171
Do you like this 3rd wheel
more than me?!

505
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:53,067
If you don't want to be a 3rd wheel yourself,
then stop whining and just follow me.

506
01:00:53,623 --> 01:00:54,820
Let's go.

507
01:00:58,537 --> 01:01:00,576
Hey, wait for me!

Really?

527
01:03:13,512 --> 01:03:15,735
She forced Ga Eul's father into
early retirement without warning?
