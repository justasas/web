4
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,790
- Oh...
- Giddyup, giddyup!

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,730
Grandfather, faster! Faster!

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,960
Oh, alright.

7
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,810
Sir, I will do it instead.

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,360
Eh? Giving a horseback ride to a grandson
is a grandfather's pleasure.

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,340
Why would you try to take that away?

10
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,210
- Ji Hoo, having fun?
- Yes, Grandfather!

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,540
- That's good.
- But let's go fishing.

12
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,020
I'll catch a gigantic shark!

13
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,990
Fishing? OK, Ji Hoo.

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,140
- When should we go?
- Let's go now.

15
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,400
OK, let's go.

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,280
- Oh, that boy...
- Sir, are you that happy?

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,830
Ah, you! Become a grandfather
and you'll know the feeling.

18
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,340
Yes?

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,370
What did you say? There's no mistake?

20
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,250
Give a straight answer.
Is it definitely Ji Hoo?

21
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,290
- Sir...
- Yes?

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,780
<i>Due to talk of a tie-up between
Shinhwa and JK Group,</i>

23
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,590
<i>the prices of Shinhwa related stocks
are hitting new highs every day.</i>

24
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,410
<i>The two groups consummating
the strategic merger</i>

25
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:07,811
<i>are expected to become blood-tied...</i>

26
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,510
Do you know what that means?

27
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,300
If tomorrow, things fall
apart with JK Group,

28
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,620
what do you think will happen?

29
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,000
In one morning, our company's stock
could become worthless paper.

30
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,380
Your grandfather, your father...
shed blood and sweat to protect Shinhwa.

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,480
But because of your childish love,

32
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:32,181
does it have to be tossed aside
for you to come to your senses?

33
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,290
That's enough!

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,850
- Jun Pyo, go outside.
- I'm not done talking.

35
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,100
Jun Pyo, as of tomorrow, you will act
like Ha Jae Kyung's fiance and mean it.

36
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:44,001
Understand?

37
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,110
You can't answer me?

38
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,760
Didn't I tell you to get out?

39
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,150
Was I not enough?

40
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,310
- Don't get involved.
- Need a hotel, sell a daughter.

41
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,760
Need investment, sell a son.

42
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,660
The next time you need something,
what will you do then?

43
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,680
Because you don't have any more children.

44
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,350
Everything has been for your sake.

45
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,180
And who decides that?

46
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,810
Who the hell says that everything is for us?

47
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,810
I have never once thought,

48
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,670
that you've done anything for our sake.

49
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,500
Your world of happiness,
who do you think gave it to you?

50
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,690
Happiness, you say?

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,550
Do you even know what happiness is?

52
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,420
I have no reason to hear your complaints
caused by too much luck.

53
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,650
Jun Pyo... Please let him be.

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,060
I already told you that this
is none of your business!

55
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,060
This time...

56
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,890
I will not just sit back and watch.

57
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,930
Su... Sunbae!

58
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,500

60
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,820
And you, what are you doing at this hour?

61
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,840
I... a situation kind of came up.

62
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,360
You're doing all this by yourself?

63
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm in the middle of doing all this.

64
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,650
Now what are you doing?

65
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,810
I told you... I can do some cleaning too.

66
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,850
Thank you.

67
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,650
Here.

68
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,300
I can't split the money with you.

69
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,000
So instead, I'll be responsible
for the coffee and the drive.

70
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,640
Drive?

71
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,540
Jan Di... Jan Di...

72
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,580
Wake up! Can you hear me?

73
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,740
I'm OK.

74
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,110
Get up!

75
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,020
Get on!

76
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,640
It's overwork and malnutrition.

77
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,960
With some rest, she'll be fine.

78
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,980
Thank you.

79
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,180
I'll just do this for you and leave.

80
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,840
Because you were my friend, I backed off.

81
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:52,241
Because she was my friend's girl,
I even gave up.

82
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,370
Also, to the very end, I gave you a chance.

83
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,710
Now, I'm not going to hold back.

84
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,880
What? Now that Jun Pyo's engaged,

85
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,800
you got anxious so you decided
to throw yourself at him?

86
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,250
- You detestable and audacious little..
- That's enough!

87
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,420
Your grandfather, your father...
shed blood and sweat to protect Shinhwa.

88
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,540
But because of your childish love,

89
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:27,041
does it have to be tossed aside
for you to come to your senses?

waiting for you at the playground.</i>

93
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,180
Gu Jun Pyo...

94
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,980
Did something happen to Gu Jun Pyo?

95
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,870
He wants to officially date me.

96
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,330
Because I was so happy...
Because I thought I'd go crazy,

97
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,550
I ran over here to tell you.

98
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,690
You're going to congratulate me, aren't you?

99
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,710
Congratulations.

100
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,500
Falling in love with one's fiance...

101
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,540
Isn't it just too romantic?

102
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,160
Thank you.

103
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,290
Having a friend to whom I can
tell these kinds of things...

104
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,370
It makes me so happy.

105
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,320
Hello.

00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,700
<i>Hello.</i>

107
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,600
I got a matching phone as a present.

108
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,600
Ah, yes...

109
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,350
Let's go.

110
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,260
<i>Please look this way.</i>

111
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,980
<i>Please look this way.</i>

112
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,500
<i>Look this way. One more time, please...</i>

113
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,680
Seeing them standing side by side like
this, aren't they a well-matched couple?

114
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,790
That's true.

115
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,150
Jun Pyo, in such a short time,
you've gotten more dignified.

116
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:20,010
Jae Kyung, now stop being frivolous
and be careful not to disgrace Jun Pyo.

117
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,700
Oh, that's not so.

118
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,750
Now, isn't it about time to change the image
of Shinhwa Group's head wife?

119
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,620
Jae Kyung, going forward,
please continue to brighten things up.

120
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,410
Thank you.

121
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,400
Then can we leave now?

122
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,190
And where would you go?

123
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,740
The significance of the first date
and you want us to be followed?

124
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,230
Oh, alright. Alright.

125
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,310
Please take good care of her, Jun Pyo.

126
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,600

bad habits somewhere...</i>

<i>I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!</i>

130
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,600
<i>Shall we go?</i>

131
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,670
<i>But I want to stay with Grandmother.</i>

133
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,520

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,290
"Jun"? You think that I'm a puppy...?

136
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,110
- Oh, what do you mean, a picture?!
- Look up there.

137

Come on.

141
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,930
I don't want to!
I told you that I'm not getting on.

142
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,780
If you want to ride it,
then get on by yourself.

143
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,560
We're on a date so why
should I ride it by myself?

144
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,170
Ah, you're afraid of heights?
That's it, isn't it?

145
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,800
That really doesn't suit you.

146
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,140
Who's afraid of heights?

147
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,080

Couldn't you make up with your grandfather?

00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,500
We never fought.

163
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,760
I'm the one who was abandoned.

Are you really going to be like this?

I'm always the one begging.

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,020
Even when we're together,
it doesn't even seems like it.

179
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,370
You're really being annoying.

180
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,620
If you're that discontented,
then you can just stop chasing after me.

181
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,580
It's because I'm uneasy.

182
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,470
What?

183
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,970
I keep... feeling uneasy.

184
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,440
If you make me believe...
If you reassure me,

185
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,710
I'll stop chasing after you.

186
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,770
I'll wait politely.

187
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,540
What do I need to do?

188
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,010
Kiss me.

189
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,990
Hey, Jun, wait for me!

190
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,240
Hey, Jun, I said wait for me.

191
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,420
Now what?

192
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,280
You're annoying so just go away.

193
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,030
But when I get a boyfriend,
I've wanted to do 99 things.

194
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,420
You're already annoyed?

195
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,280
99 things?

196
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,040
I'm not interested,
so do them with another guy.

197
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,010
I'm busy.

198
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,060
Fine, then let's do one thing each day.

199
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,010
So when 99 days passes and it's the
100th day, we'll be like real lovers.

200
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,200
Talking about a 100th day...

201
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,970
You planning on sticking to me until then?

202
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,380
Then, because today's the first day,
how about 2 special things?

203
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:12,800
Can you take me somewhere?

204
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,090
You must’ve been an otter in your past life.

205
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,590
Me?

206
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,050
You're similar.

207
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,410
You’re diligent, clumsy, and cute.

208
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,930
Even the part where you
can’t live without water.

209
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,530
Can’t you tell me that
I’m like a mermaid or something?

210
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,080
You can’t be a mermaid...

211
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,650
Not the part about not
finding love and it turning into bubbles.

212
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:02,651
{\a6}a pun with the fairytale
"The Little Mermaid" and water bubbles.

213
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,380
It’s too sad.

214
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,520
Otter must be hungry.

215
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,620
Let’s go. I’ll buy dinner.

216
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,480
Monkey, why do I have to go to places
like this? You go by yourself.

217
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,980
I’m telling you to try it.
It’s really good.

218
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,330
Jun Pyo.

219
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,730
It’s Jan Di!

220
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,060
Jan Di, how are you here?
We totally had telepathy, don't we?

221
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,440
Hello. My name is Cha Eun Jae.

222
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,620
Excuse me for a moment.

223
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,510
Welcome!

224
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,230
I welcome you to the world of pottery.

225
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,770
Thank you.

226
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
I’m the one that’s thankful.

227
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,640
Huh?

228
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,850
Only middle-aged ahjummas
usually visit here.

229
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,800
I’m really happy to see
someone around my age.

230
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,000
How did you become interested in pottery?

231
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,560
Someone I know makes pottery.

232
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,500
Do you like that person?

233
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,460
Excuse me?

234
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,720
Because you want to get to know him

235
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,560
Learning what he does and
wanting to do it with him

236
00:35:00,661 --> 00:35:02,861
because you want
to know him better...

237
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,470
I know that feeling very well.

238
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,600
Do you by chance have...?

239
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,760
He was my playmate.

240
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:16,620
While the other children played house,
we played pottery.

241
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,820
Did your boyfriend become a potter?

242
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,510
He did become a potter,

243
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,380
but he didn’t become my boyfriend.

244
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,790
There’s no need to feel sorry for me.

245
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,100
Thanks to him, I got a lot stronger.

246
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,070
This teacup.

247
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,560
Do you know that even though it looks
very thin, it’s very strong in the inside?

248
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,110
After it gets spun, stepped, and carved
thousands of times on the spinning wheel...

249
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,720
1,300 degrees.

250
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,180
You’re right!

251
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,780
It has to endure 1300 degrees in the kiln
to form the strong spirit that it has.

252
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,010
But... how did you know that?

253
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,830
There was a time when I
overheard it somewhere.

254
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:24,230
To me, that friend was my
kiln and my spinning wheel.

255
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,230
Have you forgotten that person yet?

256
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,040
Bring your friend over sometime.
I’m curious.

257
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,490
This is my studio.

258
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,140
Please do your "work" someplace else.

259
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:35,841
<i>{\a6}Work - a pun for flirting
and picking up women.</i>

260
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:39,050
Son, you work here as well.

261
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,300
Let’s be thoughtful to each other.

262
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,930
If you’re going to come and go like this,
I’m going to move my studio.

263
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,220
You can’t do that.

264
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,140
I may be able to leave, but you can’t.

265
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,530
Have you forgotten?...

266
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,690
The fact that the head of pottery
in the So family is not me,

267
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,270
but you, Yi Jung.

268
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,840
I never said that I wanted to do it.

269
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,560
You never said that you
didn’t want to do it either.

270
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,500
Isn’t that so?

271
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,580
Why do you live like this?

272
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,520
Because I’m bored of it.

273
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,320
I’m bored of living, Son.

274
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:44,560
Has there even been one second
where you lived to the fullest?

275
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,430
There... was only one woman

276
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,531
that made me wanted
to live the right way.

277
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,980
After you lose that kind of woman,

278
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,980
they’re all the same.

279
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,510
They’re all just meaningless repetition.

280
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,790
To Mother...

281
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:20,491
Don’t you feel that you’re
being too cruel to Mother?

282
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,500
That's why I’m wishing my
life would pass by quickly.

283
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,410
But things just don’t happen
the way I wish them to.

284
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,820
Do you know why you became a
potter setting all things aside?

285
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:51,900
It’s because you are like me.

286
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,150
It’s cruel, right?

287
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,370
Don’t forget.

288
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,360
The "real one" only comes once.

289
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,100
Another cruel reality.

290
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,540
The two servings of kimbab
that you ordered are here.

291
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,000
<i>{\a6}Event: For great women that can finish
our free jumbo ramen within 20 minutes,</i>

292
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:09,801
<i>{\a6}we offer you coupons for
50 free bowls of ramen as a prize.</i>

293
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,650
Please enjoy.

294
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,230
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

295
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,160
Is that for real?

296
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,150
Yes?

297
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,070
But it’s pretty difficult to pull off.

298
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,150
Do you want to do it?

299
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,240
If I really succeed, will you give me
a free coupon for 50 bowls of ramen?

300
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,040
Of course.

301
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,390
But who’s going to do it?

302
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,340
I am.

303
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,690
Hey, monkey. What are you doing?

304
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,990
Jan Di, you want that, don’t you?

305
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,460
Okay. I’ll win it for you.

306
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,780
Don’t do it. Are you some kind
of eating god to eat all that?

307
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,430
What are you going to do if I succeed?

308
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,760
What?

309
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,800
If I win, then all three of you have to
listen to one wish that I have.

310
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,960
Wish?

311
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,050
I’ll do it.

312
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,700
Yes!

313
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,540
I challenge the jumbo bowl of ramen.

314
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,680
Start!

315
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,130
Five,

316
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,400
Four,

317
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,310
Three,

318
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,480
Two,

319
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,380
One!

320
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,470
Success!

321
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,860
Jan Di, a present.

322
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,770
Now, you guys have to listen to my wish.

323
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,600
What is that wish?

324
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,670
Let's go on a trip!

325
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,890
What?

326
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,360
The four of us.

327
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,350
Jan Di, Ji Hoo, Jun Pyo and me.

328
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,330
Let’s have the two couples
go on a doubles trip. To our resort.

329
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,490
Hey, monkey.

330
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,280
I hate going on doubles.

331
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,740
What kind of excuse is that? You agreed
to listen to my wish no matter what.

332
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,210
Jan Di, you’re going to go with me, right?

333
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,560
Let’s go.

334
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,350
What are you!?

335
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,990
How can a girl eat all that?

336
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,240
You’re not even some kind of glutton.

337
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,650
Jan Di, let’s go. Hm?

338
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,380
Ji Hoo, let’s go.

339
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,430
Mom, please don’t die.

340
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,730
Don’t die.

341
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,080
I found you.

342
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,070
Do you think Mom will die?

343
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,670
She’ll be okay.

344
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,680
So Yi Jung, where are you?

345
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,010
Yi Reum oppa’s calling.

346
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,000
How did you find me?

347
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:02,640
Wherever you are, I just know.

348
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,100
You can’t go until I fall asleep, ok?

349
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:47,040
Can I sleep a little?

350
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,440
Eun Jae.

351
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,200
Can’t you...

352
00:48:22,501 --> 00:48:25,701
find me again?

353
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,360
You were the one...

354
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:35,761
who always found me.

355
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,050
Good morning!

356
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,320
Hey, monkey.

357
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,780
Why are you here first thing in the morning?

358
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,640
What kind of speech is that to your fiancee?

359
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,980
It’s okay.

360
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,770
I think it’s his way of showing
affection, so I don’t feel bad.

361
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,160
I’ve already grown accustomed to it.

362
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,490
You make a perfectly able person a mutt.

363
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,380
This is why well raised
ladies are different.

364
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,470
Because Jae Kyung, a kind heart like yours

365
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:06,771
can't be bought with money or taught.

366
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,960
No, that’s not true.

367
00:50:08,061 --> 00:50:10,761
I've recently made a friend,

368
00:50:10,862 --> 00:50:13,762
who's pretty and strong willed,
even though she has a difficult life.

369
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,660
Friend?

370
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,560
Hey, monkey?

371
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,000
Aren’t you going to go?

372
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,090
If we are late, then the cars
will get backed up.

373
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,550
Then we’ll go.

374
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,490
Have a good time.

375
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:32,620
We have to go this way.

376
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,090
Hello. How are you?

377
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,430
Wait right here.

378
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,080
Tada.

379
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:58,900
How is it? Is it pretty?

380
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,020
Do you think Jun Pyo will like it?

381
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,250
I usually get goosebumps
over stuff like this,

382
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,540
but I think people really do change.

383
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,260
I keep wanting to mark him as my man.

384
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,380
J J?

385
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,010
Jun Pyo and Jae Kyung.

386
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,950
When I got it engraved,
it felt a little strange.

387
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,370
I wondered if this guy
is really my other half.

388
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,590
J J.

389
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,960
I see.

390
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,760
Now…

391
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,620
How is it?

392
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,160
It’s good.

393
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:06,940
It doesn’t taste good.

394
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,430
Could you prepare us dinner?

395
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,030
Yes, a BBQ.

396
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,710
Jan Di, eat up.

397
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,430
Here.

398
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,460
I don’t have any.

399
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,690
Jan Di.
Jan Di.

400
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,380
Geum Jan Di, are you okay?

401
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,910
Get a hold of yourself.

402
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,790
Geum Jan Di, are you okay?

403
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,870
Are you coming to?

404
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,770
Gu Jun Pyo.

405
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,560
You can’t swim.

406
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,920
I can now.

407
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,910
What happened?

408
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,240
I learned.

409
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,960
You don’t turn your head.
How many times are you turning your head?

410
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,220
Don’t bend your knees.

411
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,890
<i>Kick, with force.</i>

412
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,680
Instead of letting some other guy save you,

413
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,080
I realized I'd rather die.

414
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,770
So I learned for you.

415
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,510
What happened?

416
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,650
Is Jan Di okay?

417
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,970
She’s okay.

418
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,980
That’s a relief.

419
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,920
I’ll take her from this point on.

420
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,790
Yeah. Take her so she can rest.

421
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:10,180
Are you okay?

422
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,290
I’m okay.

423
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,510
Two cups of latte.

424
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,500
Enjoy.

425
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,260
- What cakes are good?
- Cakes?

426
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:19,240
We have chocolate cake and cheesecake today.

427
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:21,210
I think the cheesecake would
suit better with the latte.

428
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,950
Please give us two slices of cheesecake.

429
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,550
Two? Ok.
Do you need anything else?

430
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,000
Why are you like this? Are you crazy?

431
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:46,440
No.

432
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,520
I’m so clearheaded.

433
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,760
That’s why I finally understood.

434
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:55,170
What? What did you finally understand?

435
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,990
Do you remember?

436
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,570
The story that our grandpa
told us about the Kiln God.

437
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,520
What are you trying to say?

438
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,950
The bowl that the Kiln God selected

439
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:12,651
is not mine, but yours, Yi Jung.

440
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,880
Hyung.

441
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,910
You don’t know...

442
01:00:25,411 --> 01:00:27,411
how much I wanted
these hands.

443
01:00:29,012 --> 01:00:32,712
Do you?

444
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,840
So…

445
01:00:52,141 --> 01:00:54,241
you’re saying you’re going to give up?

446
01:00:57,550 --> 01:00:59,830
You’re saying that you’re
going to go out on your own?

447
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,590
You're running away!

448
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,690
You’re saying you’re leaving
me alone in this house,

449
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:12,891
with all the responsibility?

450
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:15,100
And run away all by yourself!

451
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,720
Are you okay?

452
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:42,830
I keep forgetting that I shouldn’t
be swimming anymore.

453
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,890
Do I have to be a firefighter
and a lifeguard too now?

454
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:56,940
I lost something, so I’ll be back soon.

455
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,970
Don't worry.

456
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,520
I won’t get into any more accidents.

457
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:44,430
I’ll take her from this point on.

458
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,360
What are you doing?
