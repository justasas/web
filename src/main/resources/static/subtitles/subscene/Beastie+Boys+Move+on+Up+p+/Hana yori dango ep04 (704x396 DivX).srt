1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:02,271
Don't be such an idiot!

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:04,956
In my ordinary life...

3
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:06,536
It hurts, onee-chan.

4
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:08,054
Nee-chan?

5
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:11,065
... yet another great person has appeared.

6
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:12,075
Hi there.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,180
Perhaps he really likes you, Tsukushi.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,273
What?

9
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:17,739
Thank you.

10
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,071
Wait a minute, Rui.

11
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,599
If you meet any people in Paris who are bothering you,

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,432
tell me at once,
and the three of us will fly down to help you.

13
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:28,607
I'll be off.

14
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:30,114
Rui!

15
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,606
Hanazawa Rui followed Shizuka-san to Paris.

16
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:37,409
You can't be too fast.

17
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,939
If you want someone to love you,
you must first love her.

18
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:46,445
Oh no, onee-chan.

19
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:47,992
I feel like...

20
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:50,022
I've just been struck by lightning.

21
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:54,791
Sunday, 1pm at the open area
at "Ebisu Garden Place" near the clock.

22
00:00:54,791 --> 00:01:00,064
And this irritating guy actually
did something as outrageous as...

23
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:01,617
Unbelievable.

24
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:03,560
Why?

25
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,982
Um..

26
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:26,250
Makino!

27
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,146
C... C... Cold...

28
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,770
W... Wait a minute.

29
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,840
Suddenly grabbing me like that.
What on earth are you trying to do?

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,071
I'm glad that you're safe.

31
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:54,639
Eh?

32
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:58,413
I was afraid you might be in trouble.

33
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:00,518
It's okay...

34
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,966
Can I ask why you are so late?

35
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,075
Huh?

36
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:08,916
If you can't give me a reason, I'll kill you.

37
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:11,880
W... Who said I'll come?
I never even agreed to you in the first place.

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,455
Didn't I ask you?

39
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:14,262
Eh?

40
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:17,955
You were actually here long before already.

41
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:23,576
Perhaps, you've fallen for me?

42
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:26,936
Huh?

43
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:31,313
Wait... Wait...

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,131
This can't be good.
It's so cold.

45
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:58,047
Let's go and have some hot tea.

46
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,613
You really make people angry.

47
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:06,018
Let's go then.

48
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:10,606
Huh? Wait for me.

49
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:22,970
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:34,033
Let's stop here.

51
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,291
This building is 4 storeys high.

52
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,477
The Ebisu sold here is delicious and cheap.

53
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:38,569
They even sell cake here.

54
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:40,190
Are you sure, here?

55
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,472
Do you come here often?

56
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,051
Don't complain so much.

57
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:45,690
I don't like it.

58
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,284
Eating at low-class places like these,

59
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:49,366
my pride doesn't permit it.

60
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:53,155
"Doesn't permit it"?
Don't you think that you shouldn't always be
so concerned about your pride?

61
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:54,377
Hi there Miss.

62
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:56,896
Please take a look. We are doing a survey.

63
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:59,120
Please look carefully.

64
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,334
That...

65
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,987
It's very easy to do...

66
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,061
Hey.

67
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:08,538
Stop it.

68
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:09,662
Huh?

69
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:12,152
That...

70
00:04:12,574 --> 00:04:16,342
Suddenly hitting that guy, what on earth were you thinking?

71
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:20,659
You can't be too nice to people who bother
the person you love.

72
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:21,313
What?

73
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,880
What do you mean by that?

74
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:27,218
Is the cake here really nice?

75
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:29,291
My "Bello" is very picky.
("Bello" = Stomach. Weird choice of words)

76
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,555
"Bello"...?

77
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:32,533
Could your Japanese be quite weak?

78
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,598
Does it matter if my Japanese is weak?
It's just that I'm not good with words.

79
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:37,036
He really is dumb.

80
00:04:42,613 --> 00:04:45,751
Eh? It's not working.

81
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,004
Hey hey hey.

82
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,780
Don't tell me its spoilt.

83
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:55,834
It can't be...

84
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,108
You're joking.

85
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:59,107
Hey hey!

86
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,978
Anyone out there?

87
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,445
It can't be.

88
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:06,954
Let's call for help.

89
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:07,977
Good idea.

90
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,620
No reception here.

91
00:05:18,354 --> 00:05:19,973
It's all your fault.

92
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:22,185
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,382
It can't be helped.

94
00:05:28,382 --> 00:05:30,346
We have to go through the top.

95
00:05:30,786 --> 00:05:31,226
Eh?

96
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:32,064
Get up.

97
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,513
Huh?

98
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:36,179
Step onto my shoulders.

99
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:38,847
You're kidding. 
Step onto your shoulders?

100
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:40,870
What are you so shy about?

101
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,845
It's not that I'm shy about anything...

102
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,797
Then come on.

103
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:46,539
Hurry up.

104
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:47,481
What are you doing?

105
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:49,252
Wait... Stop!

106
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,124
Stop what you are doing!

107
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:52,326
It hurts.

108
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,031
Alright.

109
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,297
What's all this?

110
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,797
I'm scared.

111
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,198
Help me up.

112
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,016
It's so frightening.

113
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:35,301
Looks like the situation is really bad.

114
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,568
What to do...

115
00:06:39,236 --> 00:06:43,060
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

116
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,622
What was that?

117
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:48,252
It's no good,

118
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:49,641
I can't hold it anymore.

119
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:52,772
Wait...

120
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,490
What are you doing, pervert?

121
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,845
I need to let go.

122
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:57,034
Look away.

123
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:59,509
Disgusting.

124
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:11,205
Help!!

125
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,498
What on earth are you doing?

126
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:19,426
It's so scary. So scary...

127
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:20,851
Grab this.

128
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:22,755
I'm... I'm going to fall.

129
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:23,939
Stupid,

130
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:25,594
now's not the time to be saying such things.

131
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:28,107
I'm... I'm scared.

132
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:29,823
Help me quickly!

133
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:30,882
Here...

134
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,200
Makino...

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,332
Huh?

136
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:05,137
What?

137
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,367
St... Stop.

138
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:14,044
I'll never forgive you if you do something perverted.

139
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,689
I...

140
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:27,114
S... Stop... Settle down.

141
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:32,150
No... No... Don't do it.

142
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:33,686
Don't come closer.

143
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:35,209
Don't come closer.

144
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,573
Don't come closer.

145
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:39,106
Alright, next is "Kikiippatsu".
(Lit: To hang by a stand of hair.
An extremely delicate/dangerous situation.)

146
00:08:39,106 --> 00:08:43,338
<Idioms>
Oh. This will definitely be in the next exam.

147
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:44,294
I got it.

148
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:48,869
It means that if you hit someone
with a black mustache in the stomach,
it will hurt so much that he will leave his seat.
("patsu" is to leave/depart)

149
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:49,738
Right,

150
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,020
let's get this guy to "Kikiippatsu".

151
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:55,375
Wrong!

152
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,836
Then what does it mean?

153
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:01,150
It refers to a situation which is extremely dangerous,
that's "Kikiippatsu".

154
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,514
I see.

155
00:09:02,514 --> 00:09:06,572
Listen here, kid. Don't write the word wrongly as "hand".
("Kiki" for "te")

156
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:09,027
"Kikiipatsu"!!

157
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:14,996
Please don't say such lame things, dad.
You really are very childish.

158
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:18,574
Yea... Well then dad will only drink 
a bottle of beer only next week.

159
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:21,392
Dad is in a "Kikiipatsu" (situation).

160
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:26,747
Tsukushi is so late today.

161
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:33,741
No... Doing this... What are you thinking of doing?

162
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:36,349
Stop... What are you...

163
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,598
Go away.

164
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,973
Oh my... It's hot.

You really are troublesome.

176
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:21,391
I've got it.
<That's the equivalent of aspirin/panadol/paracetamol in Japan>

177
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:27,656
Open your mouth.

178
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:32,136
Eh?
What's that?

179
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:33,836
It's medicine.

180
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,841
Don't just give me any strange medicine.

181
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,963
Shut up and do what I said.

182
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,114
There will be people coming to get us in the morning.

183
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,491
Hang in there.

184
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,118
You...

185
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:05,051
Don't feel cold?

Commoners are used to the cold, so it's all right.

187
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:12,307
I'm as tough as wild grass.
("Tsukushi" means "wild grass")

188
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,693
Sorry.

189
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,272
Then again,

190
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:26,572
we ended up like this
because you were late in the first place.

191
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,629
What's so funny?

192
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:37,715
In this state, you no longer have the dignity
of a member of F4.

193
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:40,520
Shush.

194
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:49,048
The Red Paper...

195
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,010
I revoked it.

196
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:59,241
Perhaps it's a bit too late.

197
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:05,058
You're only kidding yourself.

198
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:10,860
You think I'll forgive you so easily?

199
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:01,881
Hey hey...

200
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:05,096
Eh?

201
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,598
What are you two doing?

202
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:11,459
Ah..

203
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:12,654
It hurts...

204
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:16,758
This won't do.
You can't just enter the building before it opens.

205
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:20,487
If you want to do those sort of things, go to a hotel.

206
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:29,571
Can you make it back alone?

207
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,423
Yea.

208
00:16:32,077 --> 00:16:33,892
Makino. About that...

209
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:38,904
I'm really sorry for the mess I made.

210
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:42,284
Then let me thank you...


211
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:43,762
Eh?

212
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,826
Quickly apologise...

213
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:50,944
Apologise...?

214
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:58,599
Stop!

215
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:03,239
Did the two of you kiss then?

216
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,294
How could we?

217
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:08,325
I never intended to.
I ran before he could do anything.

218
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:09,538
Oh.

219
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:13,729
So, your family must be quite worried.

220
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,703
Oh no, they're the worst...

221
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,741
You never even came to us to discuss
what you wanted to do!

222
00:17:21,693 --> 00:17:23,340
I'm sorry.

223
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:32,831
I never thought that onee-chan would resort
to doing those sort of things.

224
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,909
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,715
Where exactly did you go?

226
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:45,352
Dad thought you met with great trouble.

227
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:52,079
This is the result of spending the night away from home
for the very first time.

228
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,658
You didn't have any problems in school?

229
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:58,634
That... It created a huge fuss...

230
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:00,651
A huge fuss?

231
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:05,776
So tired...

232
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,380
Hmphh..

233
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:13,453
Huh?

234
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:16,112
Tsuki...

235
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:29,267
Tsuki... Tsuki... Tsuki.........

236
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:31,866
Tsuki...?

237
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:36,075
Not bad eh, Tsuki.

238
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,447
I'm really envious.

239
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:47,046
After that, the attitude of everyone in the school
suddenly changed?

240
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,674
Tsuki, let's go shopping later.

241
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,864
Oh yea, let's go and have lots of fun later.

242
00:18:55,864 --> 00:18:57,527
Yea... I got it... OK OK

243
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:04,596
Unbelievable.

244
00:19:04,596 --> 00:19:07,252
And then... Doumyoji also...

245
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,213
They're here.

246
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:22,553
Yo!

247
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,515
Hey Tsukasa. Is this true?

248
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:32,418
No... That's...

249
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:33,945
Ah, it's true.

250
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:34,527
Eh?

251
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:40,053
Hey hey. Seems like Tsukasa has become more of a man.

252
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,045
I guess.

253
00:19:41,045 --> 00:19:42,556
Wait a minute...

254
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:51,240
Perhaps Doumyoji-san really likes you?

255
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,123
No way that can happen.

256
00:19:54,067 --> 00:20:01,037
Ah, but he told me he revoked The Red Paper.
It's alright now.

257
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:11,533
Come back to school.

258
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:17,609
Are you sure it's really alright?

259
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:20,431
Mm.

260
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,012
NO!

261
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:42,716
Ah, I'm sorry.

262
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:56,171
Are you serious about Makino Tsukushi, eh Tsukasa?

263
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,006
I'll put this here...

264
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:01,024
I'm definitely supporting him.

265
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:05,959
But don't our girlfriends need to be
picked out and approved by our family?

266
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:08,461
Eh? It's not here?

267
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:14,159
The deeper he goes, he'll end up hurting Makino Tsukushi
even more in the end.

268
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:16,343
I won't let her get hurt by anything.

269
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,382
Eh?

270
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:24,747
I won't do anything to hurt Makino.

271
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:29,654
Hey hey, Tsukasa.
Are you too obsessed with her?

272
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,529
Now now Tsukasa.

273
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:35,845
The first thing that makes a girl happy
is the desires of her man.

274
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:38,671
How does it feel to be a bit more gentle?

275
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:39,866
I didn't do that.

276
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:44,144
We haven't got to the "dating stage" yet.

277
00:21:44,144 --> 00:21:47,557
But then Tsukasa, you spent a night alone with her.

278
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:56,121
Ah. It's always best to be natural on the first.

279
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:01,680
I can't let this go on...

280
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,447
You've been together for a night...

281
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,732
No way...

282
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:06,484
I must be responsible for my actions.

283
00:22:06,484 --> 00:22:07,974
What "responsible"?

284
00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:12,707
Oh, yea... yea yea...

285
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,085
Is Tsukasa alright?

286
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:22,053
What's he going to do next?

287
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:29,479
Next time, let's have a double date.

288
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,799
I've said many times,

289
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,394
that sort of thing (dating) never happened to us.

290
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:39,092
You even said "us", that's admitting it.

291
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:42,198
No way, I'm not saying anything else.

292
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:46,148
Have mercy on me...

293
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:50,442
You're so carefree, how I envy you, Yuuki.

294
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:53,397
You get to study with people of similar tastes.

295
00:22:54,052 --> 00:22:58,276
You still can't forget that "Marble Eyes"?

296
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,007
Eh?

297
00:22:59,007 --> 00:23:02,615
Makino, I really like your determination.

298
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,413
Don't forget him.

299
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:07,521
Lady boss.

300
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:10,584
If you forget about a man,
another new one will appear.

301
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:15,191
There will be new hurts,
new wounds of the heart.

302
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:15,972
Oh.

303
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:20,657
I used to love this man called John.

304
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:21,859
He sounds like a foreigner.

305
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:26,444
I forgot everything when I
was in by his warm arms.

306
00:23:26,444 --> 00:23:31,538
John!!! His other name was Lenon.

307
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:32,382
Eh?

308
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,473
In other words, John Lenon?

309
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:38,669
Rounded spectacles really looked good on him.

310
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:42,752
He was such a gentleman.

311
00:23:42,752 --> 00:23:46,425
I was completely taken in...

312
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,668
I only needed to hear his gentle voice calling out to me...
I would forget everything else.

313
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,836
We had such a lovely time together

314
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:57,515
Old lady, isn't your real name Ono Yoko?

315
00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:59,267
"Sengoku Sachiyo"
(Lit: A thousand generations of happiness)

316
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:06,721
Sigh... An opportunity wasted...
He was trivial like a small worm.

317
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:10,158
What a joke.

318
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:15,951
How old exactly is Lady Boss?

319
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:26,381
You can't be too fast. To be loved,
one has to first love.

320
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:32,283
Yes...

321
00:24:35,196 --> 00:24:42,913
There will be new hurts,
new wounds of the heart...?

322
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:48,940
Maybe he really likes Tsukushi-chan.

323
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:53,907
No no no...

324
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:59,365
This is really unbelievable!

325
00:25:06,117 --> 00:25:07,489
Why is it like this?

326
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:11,977
Why are you here? And you need to take off
your shoes before you come in.

327
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:12,847
Why?

328
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:17,499
Alright alright. Doumyoji-san is here to apologise
about what happened last night.

329
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:22,941
Why didn't you tell us earlier that
you were together with the wealthy Doumyoji-san?

330
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:24,321
Eh? But...

331
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:32,463
From today onwards, I hope that you'll take good care of
my daughter until the two of you are old.

332
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:34,277
That's how I feel as well.

333
00:25:34,277 --> 00:25:35,838
Wa... Wait... What are you all doing?

334
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,944
Onii-sama, do you need me to get you
a bottle of beer?

335
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:40,939
Oh, if you don't mind otou-to (little brother).

336
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:42,926
No problem at all!

337
00:25:44,046 --> 00:25:45,595
It's not good to drink beer!

338
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:46,884
Why are you all so nice to him?

339
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:49,269
We're all family, right?

340
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:54,201
I have something to say to you,
come here.

341
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:55,599
What?

342
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,750
Hurry up.

343
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:00,457
Ma'am.

344
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm having my meal now, please don't bother me.

345
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,469
I know, but...

346
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:05,723
Is it urgent?

347
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:12,016
The piece of puzzle that we left in Tsukasa-sama room...

348
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:23,482
Is it because he ignored the puzzle,
that Tsukasa-sama has more and more conflicts with you?

349
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,281
Perhaps...

350
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:34,412
I've said what I shouldn't have, please forgive me.

351
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,110
Nishida.
Yes.

352
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:42,274
Please check on Tsukasa's activities.

353
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,543
I understand.

354
00:26:56,904 --> 00:26:59,669
Why isn't there anyone here?

355
00:27:00,214 --> 00:27:02,426
I've got this place covered.

356
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:04,383
Oh, I see.

357
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,466
Eh?

358
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:13,219
Didn't you say you had something to talk about?

359
00:27:13,219 --> 00:27:16,305
Is that why you had this whole place emptied out?

360
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:23,834
But I'm really touched,
it's the first time I visited a commoner's house.

361
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:33,239
The way my family sees the value of things
is completely different from yours.

362
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:36,897
So please don't suddenly visit us.

363
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,653
You seem a bit wet.

364
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:46,716
Hey, are you listening?

365
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:48,499
Isn't that Rui's?

366
00:27:50,031 --> 00:27:50,875
Eh?

367
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,878
You haven't returned it to him?

368
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:56,002
Yea...

369
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:02,961
You... Do you like Rui?

370
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:04,906
Eh?

371
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:11,752
Even if Rui is going after Shizuka,
do you still secretly love him?

372
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:16,278
It's not like that.

373
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,521
Anyway, it's none of your business.

374
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:20,107
Who says it's none of my business?

375
00:28:20,107 --> 00:28:21,311
Eh?

376
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:27,492
Rui... He really likes apples.

377
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:28,727
Huh?

378
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:35,587
But he only eats shredded apples.

379
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:42,497
But I believe that it's more manly to just
eat the apple bite by bite.

380
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:43,951
Hey Rui!

381
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:46,830
Can you stop that scratching sound?

382
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,465
If you continue scratching, you'll become a Buddha.
(Another of Tsukasa's bad jokes.
The word to describe the scratching sound in Japanese
is likened to a Buddha.)

383
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:51,631
Don't worry. I'm Christian.

384
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:54,210
Tsukasa.

385
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,166
There's still a lot of apple tea left.

386
00:28:56,166 --> 00:29:00,414
Soujiro, can you stop being so obsessed with tea?
Talk about something more cool.

387
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:02,641
That's not bad too, Tsukasa.

388
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:05,320
Hey Soujiro, want to try some dance moves?

389
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,752
I must say first that it has nothing to do with me.

390
00:29:11,238 --> 00:29:15,796
That was the first time they just ignored
what I said.

391
00:29:19,973 --> 00:29:23,097
Hey, you guys, look here.
This is how you eat an apple

392
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:26,370
It's much more convenient than making it
into powder.

393
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:33,911
As for me, I never learnt to eat like that.

394
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:35,169
Hang on a sec.

395
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,886
Hanazawa Rui really said that?

396
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:40,104
He said something like that.

397
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:41,718
In other words, you made it up (fiction).

398
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:47,978
Still, Rui eats apples like that.

399
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:52,044
And I was extremely annoyed by the way he ate it.

400
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:09,092
Rui, if you continue eating apples,
it's more easy for you to become bald.

401
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:10,224
Eh?

402
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:18,144
From then onwards, he never ate another apple
that he once loved.

403
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:25,657
I took away what Rui loved the most.

404
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:29,654
That was during early spring last year.

405
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:32,541
Umm...

406
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:41,613
But, I never thought I would say those things about
becoming bald and all.

407
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:47,959
Although I don't really know what you're talking about...

408
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,506
It is like that.

409
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:52,570
That's just what happened between Rui and I.

410
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,342
Truthfully?

411
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:54,462
It was just like that.

412
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:55,372
Oh!

413
00:30:55,372 --> 00:30:56,611
Rui!

414
00:30:56,611 --> 00:30:58,833
That was why at the airport...

415
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:01,395
I still don't get it.

416
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:09,208
That's why I say you still love Rui.

417
00:31:09,195 --> 00:31:10,102
I...

418
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,365
Umm...

419
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:16,625
What if... What if I actually liked Rui?

420
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:19,713
He's still got Shizuka-san.

421
00:31:23,318 --> 00:31:28,958
If you really like him, he'll definitely fall for you as well.

422
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:30,610
Eh?

423
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:38,750
I've seen many women, and they've always done it.

424
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:01,096
You're back!

425
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,860
Good work! Tsukushi.

426
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,825
You must become a modern lady, Tsukushi.

427
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:08,800
It's no longer a dream that we can all be rich and famous.

428
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,199
I'm going to buy lots of beer!

429
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:12,453
In the future when I have lots of money,
I'll buy many games.

430
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:13,713
Buy buy buy...

431
00:32:18,612 --> 00:32:19,880
Umm...

432
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,050
I've thought about it.

433
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,249
How?

434
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:29,167
That guy really is an idiot.

435
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:30,382
Eh?

436
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:37,690
He's serious about it, Tsukushi.

437
00:32:38,344 --> 00:32:40,552
It can't be.

438
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:50,460
Why hasn't Sakurako come back to school?

439
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,750
Hey, Tsuki. Don't forget about our outing later today.

440
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:54,454
Eh?

441
00:32:54,454 --> 00:32:57,369
Didn't agree that we'll go to the Club and have lots of fun?

442
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:59,049
C... Club?

443
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:02,653
I'm sorry, I was forced to go.

444
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:06,042
I got it. I'll let the Lady Boss know.

445
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:08,850
Oh, we've got customers, bye.

446
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,918
Welcome.

447
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:11,804
Is Makino Tsukushi around?

448
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:16,013
I'm sorry, she didn't come for work today.

449
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:18,096
Are you on good terms with Makino?

450
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,573
Well, we've been friends since middle school (secondary school).

451
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:22,815
Well, then you should be Makino's good friend.

452
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:23,761
I guess...

453
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:27,083
You got some time to spare? We'd like to take you with us.

454
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:31,115
Umm... I have work now...

455
00:33:31,115 --> 00:33:32,460
It's okay...

456
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,294
Wait... Lady Boss!

457
00:33:34,294 --> 00:33:36,526
Wait a minute, what are you trying to do?

458
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:38,173
We'd like to borrow this girl for a while.

459
00:33:38,173 --> 00:33:40,902
What's this all about? I'm calling the police.

460
00:33:40,902 --> 00:33:43,708
Everything... I'll buy it all.

461
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:48,284
This whole place.

462
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:49,304
Have fun.

463
00:33:49,304 --> 00:33:50,697
You can change so fast.

464
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,307
Do you accept payment by card?

465
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:54,489
Hey wait! Lady Boss!

466
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:56,779
So similar...

467
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,841
To a man I've met before.

468
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:14,120
They're good...

469
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,986
You can do that later, have a drink first.

470
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:19,091
Cheers!

471
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:24,750
Hey hey. Don't you think that guy is great?

472
00:34:24,737 --> 00:34:28,083
No way, he's soooo handsome.

473
00:34:28,587 --> 00:34:31,595
Don't you think, he looks a bit like Hanazawa Rui?

474
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:33,457
Eh? There is a resemblance.

475
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:34,895
He's looking here!

476
00:34:34,895 --> 00:34:36,404
No way, he's coming.

477
00:34:36,404 --> 00:34:38,019
He's here already.

478
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:41,705
- Hi there.
- Hi.

479
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,275
I'm going to the washroom.

480
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:47,876
Are you alone?

481
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,750
Hey, do you want to join me down here?

482
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,586
He really does look like Rui.

483
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:08,278
Tsukasa has fallen into the river of love
and he doesn't care about the consequences at all.

484
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,708
Although I feel that it's OK for
Tsukasa and Makino to be toghether.

485
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:18,241
But I don't want Tsukasa to fall too deep into this.

486
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:21,345
That's between the two of them.

487
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,001
I don't think we should interfere.

488
00:35:28,016 --> 00:35:30,066
It's okay if they're just playing.

489
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:33,375
But what if both of them run into serious problems.

490
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:34,637
You get it?

491
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:37,307
I don't get it.

492
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:39,091
You don't understand?

493
00:35:40,317 --> 00:35:43,552
I don't understand what both of you
are trying to get at.

494
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:45,884
I'll take my leave now.

495
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:47,488
Ah, wait.

496
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:49,111
Don't bother about her.

497
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,216
She's the type that gives me a big headache.

498
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,377
Sakurako?

499
00:36:14,596 --> 00:36:15,747
How can it be?

500
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,127
Hey hey.

501
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,305
Here.

502
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,053
Eh?

503
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,041
For you.

504
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,670
Is that beer (sake)?

505
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,742
No, it's not. It's oolong tea.

506
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,235
If you don't mind.

507
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:32,064
Cheers.

508
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:42,608
What's your name?

509
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,982
I'm Makino Tsukushi.

510
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:50,917
Tsukushi-chan? That's a cute.

511
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:52,508
Oh... No...

512
00:36:54,794 --> 00:36:58,750
Hey, why don't you follow me out?

513
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:01,138
Eh?

514
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:02,587
But...

515
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,083
It's nothing much... Let's go.

516
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:41,509
A dream?

517
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:48,284
Eh?

518
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,207
It's not a dream.

519
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:06,875
Why am I like this? Don't tell me that guy...

520
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:13,250
Oh no! What have I been doing?

521
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:19,583
I didn't do anything. Nothing at all.

522
00:38:19,576 --> 00:38:22,816
And the first time always involves some bleeding...
(Hint hint)

523
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:23,485
HEY!

524
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:24,607
Woah!

525
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:29,208
It's already noon. What have you been doing?

526
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:31,939
Have you been waiting long for me?

527
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:34,427
Who says I'm waiting for you?

528
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:37,245
I just happened to be passing by.

529
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:39,961
But then you'd be going in the opposite direction

530
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:41,088
You talk too much!

531
00:38:42,618 --> 00:38:43,866
Get in!

532
00:38:53,554 --> 00:38:55,958
Having lunch with F4? How envious.

533
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:58,958
We can't forgive her. Definitely not.

534
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:00,377
Yuriko.

535
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:14,356
What would you like to eat?

536
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:15,533
It's okay.

537
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:18,379
You don't normally get to eat good food.

538
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:19,807
So don't worry.

539
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,618
But, I've got my own packed lunch.

540
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:22,574
Really, there's no need.

541
00:39:22,574 --> 00:39:24,824
Don't make us men lose our dignity!

542
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:27,207
Where did you go yesterday?

543
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,819
We were looking for you at your working place,

544
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:31,472
but the told us you took the day off.

545
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:34,173
Ah... You went there...

546
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:36,217
I had something on yesterday...

547
00:39:36,217 --> 00:39:38,023
Maybe it's another man.

548
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,912
Hey hey hey... Is that true?

549
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,482
She doesn't look like the type to do those sort of things.

550
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:44,709
I...

551
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,663
Makino is certainly not that type of girl!!

552
00:39:47,663 --> 00:39:51,212
Even for you guys,
you will talk when your sleep.

553
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:53,728
But when you're awake and talking,
you don't call that talking in your sleep

554
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:57,140
You might say what you say in your sleep when you are awake,

555
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,182
but when you're awake, you don't say
what you won't say when you're asleep.

556
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:04,557
What you say when you're awake,
you say it because you're not asleep...

557
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:06,243
What the heck are you saying?

558
00:40:06,243 --> 00:40:07,864
You yourself don't even know what you're talking about.

559
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:08,978
Shut up!

560
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:12,250
In other words, you should say what you would say
in your sleep, when you sleep.

561
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,827
I think he meant REM sleep.
(REM - Rapid Eye Movement. A sleeping disorder.)

562
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:16,904
He sleeps like a ram.

563
00:40:16,904 --> 00:40:18,253
Why are we talking about goat meat?

564
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:20,383
Yes!

565
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:27,083
That guy is easily excited.

566
00:40:38,026 --> 00:40:39,369
Sakurako?

567
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,437
Eh?

568
00:40:48,374 --> 00:40:52,265
It's best if it doesn't get worse than this.

569
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:59,167
Tsukushi, nothing really happened that night?

570
00:40:59,181 --> 00:41:00,366
No no no no...

571
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:02,100
Definitely not.

572
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:06,372
You better be serious about what
doing you and Doumyoji-san are doing.

573
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,697
What? Why arey you suddenly saying this?

574
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,833
If you can't take it,

575
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,628
or if you don't like it then just tell him straight.

576
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:20,236
But, it doesn't make a difference whether
I reject him or not.

577
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:23,769
Anyway, I don't think he truly likes me.

578
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:25,051
He does like you.

579
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:31,879
And Doumyoji's friends are truly worried about
the two of you.

580
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:33,085
But then, Yuuki,

581
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:36,268
the two of them are still rich kids.

582
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:37,915
You'd better be careful.

583
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:40,886
I don't know what those two are really like,

584
00:41:40,886 --> 00:41:43,619
but I can tell they're sincere from what they said.

585
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:48,929
Doumyoji-san is actually a very lonely person.

586
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,806
I heard he was brought up by a mother who
is constantly unhappy about things around her.

587
00:42:06,832 --> 00:42:09,063
He lived in a very harsh environment.

588
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:11,959
Perhaps that's why he's overbearing.

589
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,614
Actually, beyond his fierce front,

590
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:20,660
he yearns to be loved by someone.

591
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:28,302
"Yearns to be loved"...

592
00:42:36,823 --> 00:42:39,658
Some outrageous things have been done to me.

593
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:45,491
I really don't get it.

594
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:58,716
Good morning.

595
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:05,902
Hey... What's wrong?

596
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,721
Don't act dumb, you...

597
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:15,888
You took advantage of the trust Doumyoji-san had in you.

598
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,500
I still can't believe you actually did such a thing.

599
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:20,503
What are you saying?

600
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:24,306
Don't spout nonsense.

601
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:27,792
Come here! Tsuki...

602
00:43:28,478 --> 00:43:31,875
It hurts! What are you doing?!

603
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:35,468
Take a look!

604
00:43:37,076 --> 00:43:39,458
Stop it! Let me go!

605
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:49,413
Take a good look.

606
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:54,906
<Please enjoy freely>

607
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:11,798
What's that?

608
00:44:11,798 --> 00:44:16,051
What you've done is the most demeaning thing
a woman can ever do.

609
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:17,429
No! This...

610
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,129
Still denying it?

611
00:44:20,364 --> 00:44:22,265
Not only was it Doumyoji-san,

612
00:44:22,714 --> 00:44:27,132
you deceived everyone in Eitoku Gakuen.

613
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:30,186
Even if you rely on all your previous methods,
we won't give in to you.

614
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:33,618
I suggest you prepare yourself!

615
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:35,890
What are you doing!!

616
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:42,422
What do you think you're doing...?

617
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:44,159
Please take a look at this.

618
00:44:51,431 --> 00:44:53,128
It's not what you think, Doumyoji.

619
00:45:02,171 --> 00:45:03,641
What's the meaning of this, Makino?

620
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:08,333
I think I was taken advantage of
by someone who really hates me.

621
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,082
Believe me...

622
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,917
I must definitely find out who did this.

623
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,874
Love. It happens when you least expect it.

624
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:24,583
That woman is highly dangerous.

625
00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:27,292
I can't let him go.

626
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:29,170
I will kill you.
