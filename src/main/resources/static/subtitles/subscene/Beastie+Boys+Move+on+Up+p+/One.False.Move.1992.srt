1
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,160
Who is it?

2
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,600
Fantasia.

3
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,320
Hey, girl.

4
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,120
- Haven't you left for Star City?
- Tonight.

5
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,600
You think you're bad
with that camera.

6
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,720
Come on.

7
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,840
You're ruining the shot
with your lousy dancing.

8
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,680
Bobby, look who's here.

9
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,360
- How you doing?
- Fine.

10
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,600
- Is Ray with you?
- No.

11
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,640
- That's good.
- Real good.

12
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,040
You're always welcome here.

13
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
Bobby's about to blow out
the candles on his birthday cake.

14
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,600
It's your birthday?
How old are you, sixty?

15
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
That's your I.Q., woman.

16
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
This is Darren and Danielle.

17
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,160
I left my purse in the car.
I'll be right back.

18
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,760
What are you guys doing?

19
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,120
Everybody get on the floor
and be quiet.

20
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,680
- What the fuck?
- Get on the floor, goddamn it!

21
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,960
Let it go, Ray.

22
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,360
Down.

23
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,600
Fantasia!

24
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,480
Be quiet
and everything will be okay.

25
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,680
Where does Marco live?

26
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
I don't know.

27
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
- I said, where does he live?
- I don't know.

28
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,120
- Where, goddamn it?!
- I don't know!

29
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,400
How do you get your shit?
Does it fly over here?

30
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,720
- Ray, please.
- Danielle and me don't know nothing.

31
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,880
Let us go.

32
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,320
If we tell where Marco lives,
he'll kill us.

33
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,120
What do you think we're going to do?

34
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,760
Tell me or I'll slap your head off.

35
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,480
Leave us alone!

36
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,840
You don't have to hit her like that.

37
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,600
Tell him and everything will be okay.

38
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,480
Jackie don't know anything.
I deal with Marco, not her.

39
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,840
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.

40
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,960
Who is it?

41
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,800
It's Bobby, Marco.

42
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
I got to get some stuff.

43
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,240
- I told you not to come so late.
- Come on, man.

44
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,600
I got to get something tonight.

45
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,040
Come on in here, man.

46
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,560
This is a pretty woman you got here.

47
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,120
Look at those titties.
I like those.

48
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,200
Ray, what are you doing?

49
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,520
- Hey, man!
- I want some of this.

50
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,840
What you want is on that table.
I got $200 in my wallet. Take it.

51
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,600
- I ain't fucking around.
- Take the money and the coke.

52
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,680
- This is lighter fluid.
- You're sick.

53
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,280
I'll fuck her up.
I don't want your little $200.

54
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,320
Fuck you.
I don't want your $200.

55
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,520
Stop it.

56
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,760
- Then you got the money?
- Put it out!

57
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,320
- I'll light her up!
- I'll tell you.

58
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,920
- Fuck you!
- Put it out!

59
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,000
Fuck you!

60
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,080
Motherfucker!

61
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,400
Goddamn.

62
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Goddamn.

63
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,960
Got it?

64
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,000
They got a fucking kid.

65
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Goddamn it.
Where's your kid, you motherfucker?

66
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,600
Where's your goddamn kid?

67
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,760
Go look for the kid.
We can't leave him here.

68
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,920
I've been all over the house.

69
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,520
I don't give a shit! Go look.
He might be hiding.

70
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,840
Mommy! Mommy!

71
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Honey, what's wrong?
What is it, baby?

72
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,600
It's okay. Daddy's here.

73
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,960
Bad dream, I guess.

74
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,720
- It's okay.
- You okay?

75
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,800
I'll take her in our room.

76
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,320
It's going to be okay.

77
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,000
Dale, are you coming to bed?

78
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah, I'll be right there.

79
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,880
Oh, good. Come on, Dud,
let's get to the wallets.

80
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,440
Watch your feet.

81
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,680
I need a name.

82
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,920
Let's do this body first.
I think this is our stranger.

83
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,920
What do we got?

84
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,440
John, meet Robert Prost.

85
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,840
How do you do, Robert?

86
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,760
Watch your feet.

87
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,400
We're out of here.

88
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,400
Isn't that a light
on in Robert's window?

89
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,880
Yeah.
10 o'clock in the morning.

90
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
Oh, shit!

91
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,720
John!

92
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,320
Anything on that tape?

93
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,080
Background voices.

94
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,160
You?

95
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,960
Nothing.

96
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,680
How did you I.D. This Ray Malcolm?

97
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,800
A neighbor recognized Ray's car
parked out front.

98
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,800
Did she see him?

99
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,880
She did see a black guy with glasses
come out, get in Ray's car and split.

100
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,920
She didn't know Ray's last name,
but we checked it out with some dopers.

101
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,640
You separated it?

102
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,560
Not yet.
Is that Ray's package?

103
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,120
So who's this black guy?

104
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,200
They call him Pluto.

105
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,840
He's been hanging with Ray
the last couple of weeks.

106
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,960
I'd say he's from out of town.

107
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,680
Pluto? That's it?

108
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,240
For now.

109
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,880
Who's the girl?

110
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,080
- Fantasia.
- Bullshit.

111
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,040
Good-looking. Ray's old lady.

112
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,520
Listen to this.

113
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,920
Hey, girl.
Haven’t you left for Star City?

114
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,680
Tonight.

115
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
Bobby, look who's here.

116
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,400
She said, "Haven't you left for..."
What?

117
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,920
It sounds like
"Haven't you left for Star City?"

118
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Then the other girl says something.
Play it again.

119
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,720
Hey, girl.

120
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
- Haven't you left for Star City?
- Tonight.

121
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,920
It is Star City.
"Haven't you left for Star City?"

122
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,360
Dud, check this out.

123
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,600
A robbery arrest from '79.

124
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,280
In case of emergency, notify.

125
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,640
"Jeremiah Malcolm.
Relationship: Uncle."

126
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,480
"Star City, Arkansas."
I'll be damned.

127
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,760
Jimmy. Jimmy, are you there?

128
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah, Dale. Come on back.

129
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,800
I went to the courthouse and checked
the records on Ray Malcolm.

130
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,000
He was born here,
but hasn't been back in 20 years.

131
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,080
I'm heading to the uncle's place.

132
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Do me a favor. Call Charlie, tell him
to come to work early tonight.

133
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm staying out there
in case those folks show up.

134
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,680
If they do,
we're gonna be laying for them.

135
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,360
This could be a big one.
I'll talk to you later.

136
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,120
10-4 and out.

137
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,160
Just give their names,
Ray Malcolm and Pluto Franklin.

138
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,040
Say the victims
were stabbed to death.

139
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,800
How many stab wounds?

140
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,920
Don't mention that.
Or the hog-tying and pillowcases.

141
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,960
- And the other three?
- Say they were strangled.

142
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,800
What about the kid?

143
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,120
Don't explain.
Just say someone survived.

144
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,920
And that we think the suspects fled the
state. We might get national coverage.

145
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,560
You got to give me something.
The press is all over my butt.

146
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,320
- Say they're as violent as we've seen.
- Really?

147
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,040
Thank you.

148
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,360
What's the story
on this Star City thing?

149
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,680
Somebody, come on. Dud.

150
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,280
What if you went down there?

151
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,440
We've been lucky so far.
And we can tie Ray there.

152
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,960
I talked to the police chief.
He didn't know of Ray or Fantasia...

153
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,640
but he would check the uncle out.

154
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,880
I'm waiting for his call.

155
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,160
What about an I. D.
On the second suspect?

156
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,360
Pluto. His real name
is Lenny Franklin.

157
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
He's originally from Chicago.

158
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,560
He and Ray got busted
about six years ago...

159
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,320
for another drug rip-off.
Same shit.

160
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,760
They did two years together
in San Quentin.

161
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,040
Prison buddies.

162
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,880
Pluto's a piece of work.

163
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,360
I.Q. Of 150
and a college graduate.

164
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,400
We think he did the stabbings.

165
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,040
His package indicates
he's very fond of a knife.

166
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,800
He has three priors.

167
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,760
For some reason,
he left the videotape.

168
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,480
Sick son of a bitch.

169
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,920
There were no prints,
so he left a calling card.

170
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,080
He's here.

171
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
Cole here.

172
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
Put him through.

173
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,000
Chief Dixon, this is Dud...

174
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,560
I'm fine, thank...

175
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,880
Put him on the box.
What did you say his name was?

176
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,440
Chief Dale Dixon. Chief,
I'm putting you on the speakerphone.

177
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,240
Chief Jenkins is here.

178
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,920
Los Angeles Chief of Police Jenkins?

179
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,040
No shit.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

180
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,960
Good to meet you.
Now what we want to talk about...

181
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,160
I guess you're pretty busy
out there, huh?

182
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,120
You got six people dead out there
at the same time.

183
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,320
That don't happen much here.

184
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,640
Sometimes we get a stabbing.
Colored boys, generally.

185
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,320
One of them sticks another
over a card game.

186
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,880
We should discuss the...

187
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,640
Craps sometimes.

188
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,520
Now you wanted to know
about this boy's uncle.

189
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
I think we hit the jackpot.

190
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,080
I went to the uncle's place.
It's the damndest hideout I ever seen.

191
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,960
It's in the woods
6 miles north of town.

192
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
You have to cross
a rickety old bridge.

193
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,880
You'd never find it
if you didn't know where to look.

194
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,920
You city boys would be lost
in ten minutes.

195
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,120
But I'm ready, don't worry.

196
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,400
Damn, Bonnie.

197
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

198
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,000
They were out of onion rings,
so I got you Tasty Taters.

199
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,880
It's L.A., Cheryl Ann.
Chief Jenkins and them.

200
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,680
Yes, sir.

201
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,000
You think this is a promising avenue
of investigation?

202
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,360
It's promising, all right.

203
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,760
Me and my deputies
can set up a surveillance now.

204
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,560
Chief Dixon, why don't we hold off
on that until we get a game plan.

205
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,320
If you say so.

206
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,480
That would be best.

207
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,840
It's my job. We'll get these
sons of bitches. I'll be waitin' on ya.

208
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,960
What are you doing here?
When did you get back?

209
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,520
- Wednesday night.
- Wednesday?

210
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,560
That's no honeymoon.
You should have stayed longer.

211
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,400
Earl had to get back to work,
and I'm starting a new job.

212
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,320
What are you doing?

213
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,440
Bookkeeping at the Rice Mill.
Muriel retired...

214
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,240
so I talked to Old Man Hosey,
and he hired me.

215
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,520
Take it easy.

216
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,440
Dale?

217
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, that's good. Congratulations.

218
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,200
- Thank you, Dale.
- We better be going.

219
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720
You want some of this?

220
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,640
Why don't you put some clothes on?

221
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,880
I told you to put some clothes on.

222
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,840
Ray, those people are dead.

223
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,720
Those people are dead.

224
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,800
No shit.

225
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,920
And you were there.

226
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,240
Don't forget that.

227
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,840
Didn't I tell you
to put on some goddamn clothes?

228
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,120
We got enough of this shit
to last us until 1995.

229
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,480
We got enough to last
until we get to Houston.

230
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,880
We're not selling this shit.

231
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,440
We're selling it to Billy in Houston.

232
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm going to Chicago.
I don't give a fuck what you do.

233
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,360
Riding up and down the road
don't make sense.

234
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,880
What do you think will happen?
We'll get in trouble?

235
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,440
I was planning to sell some to them
country sons of bitches in Arkansas.

236
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,720
Man, I don't like
this Arkansas shit.

237
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,920
We'll be in and out.
Don't worry.

238
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,840
We're not building a house.

239
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,200
It's not a problem.
What are you worried about?

240
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
What the fuck do you think?

241
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,960
I don't get you.

242
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
Why don't you loosen up
and have some fun?

243
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,000
Why don't you get high
with Ray and me?

244
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,680
Don't you want to feel good?

245
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,360
This is the biggest thing
to ever happened to us.

246
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,880
And you just sit there
like a little brown turd.

247
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,080
Goddamn it!

248
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,920
Watch yourself, Ray.

249
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,680
Listen up, motherfucker.
Listen up!

250
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,440
This is what will happen. We will
go to Houston and sell the shit...

251
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,480
because this little $15,000
won't last.

252
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,160
Until then,
I will hold onto the blow.

253
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,600
And, Ray, I don't want to hear
any more bullshit out of you...

254
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,200
or her.

255
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,280
You son of a bitch!

256
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,160
Fucking son of a bitch!

257
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,800
Why don't you
just go to sleep, fucker?

258
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,280
You forgot just one fucking thing.

259
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,760
You forgot about the money.
I have all the goddamn money.

260
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,520
You keep that little $15,000, Ray.

261
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,040
He's right, baby.

262
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,560
We'll sell it in Houston.
Think of all the money.

263
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,480
We'll be okay.
Pluto knows people in Chicago.

264
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,360
We can live off that money
a long time.

265
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,360
Come on, baby,
it's going to be okay.

266
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,160
We can buy all the blow we want
when we get there.

267
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,400
And we'll be safe.

268
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,440
Pluto will take care of us.

269
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,000
We'll be safe, baby.

270
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,760
This is really beautiful.

271
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,000
It's as green as hell.

272
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,560
You know I'm a country boy.

273
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
What crap. You were born in L.A.

274
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,240
Malibu.

275
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,760
What the fuck?

276
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,560
Howdy. Dale Dixon.

277
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,200
Welcome to Star City.

278
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,240
We got a lot to do,
so follow me to the motel...

279
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,080
you can unpack,
and we'll get something to eat.

280
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,000
When I saw you drive by, I knew
you were the boys from California.

281
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,200
Cops looks the same everywhere, I guess.

282
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,840
Follow me.

283
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,040
Oh, shit.

284
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,400
You boys are in for a treat.

285
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,680
Fern, can we get some more biscuits?

286
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,480
- Sure, Hurricane.
- And more coffee.

287
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,920
Hurricane?

288
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,920
Some folks call me that.
I never figured out why.

289
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,880
We can wait in the woods.
When the bad folks show up...

290
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,400
we'll put the stopper
in the bottle.

291
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,920
They'll be sorry they came to Star City.

292
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,560
This is good.

293
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,600
My mother used to make food like this.

294
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,520
Thanks. How's Walter?

295
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,440
He had gallbladder surgery...

296
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,280
Good for him. You know,
you boys have my full cooperation.

297
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,720
Me and my two deputies...

298
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,520
we'll take turns watching the place
around the clock.

299
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,640
So you boys can just relax.
Drink beer, chase chicks, whatever.

300
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,080
We'll help.

301
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,800
- We'll help you.
- Suit yourself.

302
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,680
Another thing. Old Man Malcolm.

303
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,680
I guarantee he don't know jack-shit
about what his nephew did.

304
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,520
You talked to him?

305
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,120
Not yet. I just know. There aren't
even any telephone lines up there.

306
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,200
He's a hermit.
Hardly ever leaves his property.

307
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,920
We oughta let him know.

308
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,600
- Yes, but...
- Charlie! Get on in here.

309
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,640
This is my deputy.
Retired police officer.

310
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,560
Charlie, this is Dud Cole.

311
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,280
- How are ya, Dud?
- Pleasure, Charlie.

312
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,520
- And Dan Macintosh.
- Nice to meet you, Dan.

313
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,320
John. John McFeely.

314
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,320
Oh, right.
All them Mac names sound alike to me.

315
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,680
- You eaten, Charlie?
- Yeah, Jocelyn fixed me...

316
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,280
Charlie's a Yankee from Detroit.

317
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,120
Dale, if we talk to this guy
and he's involved...

318
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,560
- I told you he's not.
- Hurricane... I mean, Dale.

319
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,400
These are dangerous people.

320
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,320
I understand that.

321
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,800
You boys about ready?

322
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,320
Just a second.

323
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,520
Here, Fern.

324
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,880
Keep the change.

325
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,880
There ain't no change, Hurricane.

326
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,480
It's a $12-check,
and you gave me a ten!

327
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,040
Catch you later.

328
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,520
Is he gone?

329
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,520
I haven't had a full meal
since I met the son of a bitch.

330
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,280
Go ahead, Jimmy.

331
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,080
It's Harlan Childress. Lureen called.
He's raising hell.

332
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,000
Unless he's trying to kill her,
I don't have time.

333
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
She said he's trying to kill her.

334
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,320
I'm just letting you know.

335
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,080
Okay, 10-4.

336
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,720
I have to make a stop
before we go to the Malcolm place.

337
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,600
Open this door!

338
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,560
Goddamn it! Lureen!

339
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,560
Harlan! Goddamn it.

340
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,000
Settle down, Harlan!

341
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,560
- Let go!
- Settle down!

342
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,640
Harlan, goddamn it!

343
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,840
You calm down now.
Calm down.

344
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,520
Do you want to take a ride with me?

345
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,520
- Calm down.
- He was out all night drinking.

346
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,880
Who are those men?!

347
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,480
It's okay.

348
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,000
She locked me out of the kitchen.

349
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,080
I understand.

350
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,240
You were out all night drinking.

351
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,440
You knew she was going to do this,
didn't you?

352
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,480
If you apologize, she may let you in.

353
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,920
I will.

354
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,040
We'll go to church, he'll feel better.

355
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,720
All right, Lureen.

356
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,280
What about them?

357
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,240
They're with me. They're from L.A.

358
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
Pull yourself together.

359
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,320
Okay. Come on.

360
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,880
Come on. Get up.

361
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,560
Now come here.

362
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,880
Do me a favor.
Put this ax back in the shed.

363
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,800
All right?

364
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,640
I don't want to have to come
back out here. Are you okay?

365
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
I'm okay.

366
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,040
Put that ax in the shed.
And fix this window.

367
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,640
Tell Cheryl Ann and the baby howdy.

368
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,160
Tell them hi.

369
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,680
- Sorry about the window.
- That's all right.

370
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,320
It's okay, boys.
I'm out here twice a week.

371
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,840
Motherfucker!

372
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,080
Goddamn it! They know me now.
Do you realize that?

373
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,240
They know my face, my name,
probably how long my dick is!

374
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,680
That goddamn kid! Why didn't you
tell me about that fucking kid?

375
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,920
I swear to God,
I didn't see any kid!

376
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,840
He must have been hiding.

377
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Quit lying!

378
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,720
Don't hit me no more.
Pluto, don't let him hit me no more.

379
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,040
Get rid of her, Ray.

380
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,680
- We'll be okay.
- Shut up.

381
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,600
We'll dump the car.
They won't find us.

382
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,520
They won't find you, maybe!

383
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,480
They won't find us!

384
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,320
- It'll be okay...
- Get your hand off me.

385
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,480
We'll be okay.

386
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,000
Isn't there another way, Dale?

387
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,640
Watch your step.
The timbers are rotten.

388
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,920
Yeah, rotten.

389
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,920
I crashed my motorcycle
on this bridge when I was 14.

390
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,080
The volunteer fire department
had to get me out.

391
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,760
You can still see some
of the burn marks there.

392
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,720
Perfect hideout.

393
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,320
- Is the old man there?
- Yeah.

394
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
- I wonder who else is.
- He's alone.

395
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,800
Dale, wait a minute.

396
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,040
It's okay, boys. Come on.

397
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
How you doin'?

398
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,880
You doin' all right?

399
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,560
You doin' all right?

400
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,120
- I'm doing all right.
- That's good.

401
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm Chief Dixon.

402
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,680
I'm fixing to do what?

403
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm Chief Dixon.

404
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,480
I'm fixing to feed the chickens
before it gets too hot.

405
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,680
You heard from your nephew?

406
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,760
Have you heard from Ray Malcolm?

407
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,960
He's my brother's boy.
I heard of my own kin.

408
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,400
When was the last time
you talked to him?

409
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,560
- Who?
- Ray Malcolm.

410
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,000
Ray is my brother's boy.

411
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,640
I got to feed these chickens.
It's going to get hot.

412
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,280
I hope you and them chickens have
a goddamn heatstroke.

413
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,720
Can I help you boys?

414
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,280
"I'm fixing to feed these chickens."

415
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,400
I say, "Have you heard from
Ray Malcolm?" Put that on my plate.

416
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,600
He says,
"Ray Malcolm is my nephew."

417
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,080
"My brother's boy.
I guess I heard of my own kin."

418
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,560
So I said:

419
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,720
"Have you spoken to him?"
He said, "Who?"

420
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,080
I said, "Ray Malcolm."
He said, "Ray's my brother's boy."

421
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Imagine the conversation
when Ray shows up.

422
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,240
Rolls?

423
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,160
Is this great or what?

424
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,720
This looks great, Cheryl Ann.

425
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,280
There you go.

426
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,600
I hope he does show up.
'Cause I got news for you.

427
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,240
That white trash
and them two niggers are...

428
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,240
Cheryl Ann, you nearly broke my...

429
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,120
Bonnie, pass me the pickles.

430
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,760
I never got any beans.
May I have some?

431
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,360
Did you think I was going to cut you?

432
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,160
I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world.

433
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,160
I'm glad you didn't kill
that car salesman.

434
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,400
What do you think we are?

435
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,400
That don't mean nothing, Dale.

436
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,400
What concerns me is that
we left ourselves so goddamn exposed.

437
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,080
So out there.

438
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,720
I could see the old man
wasn't involved.

439
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,600
You can't assume anything about anybody.
That's the guy who will fuck you.

440
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,680
Shit. I've been
police chief here for...

441
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,680
hell, going on six years.

442
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,240
I've never even drawn my gun.

443
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,440
Here we are.
Come kiss your favorite mommy.

444
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,000
Get in the bed.

445
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,400
Get in there.

446
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,280
See you in the morning.

447
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,920
Enjoying yourself?
Gettin' enough to eat and drink?

448
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,640
Just about.

449
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,880
Isn't that your second bottle?

450
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,800
Yes, it is.

451
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,080
I want to apologize
for that last comment before.

452
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,360
I bet John feels terrible.

453
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,840
Dale didn't mean it.
He grew up talking that way.

454
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,960
I understand.

455
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,360
I'm sure John does, too.

456
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,240
These people are dangerous,
aren't they?

457
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,200
Yes, they are.

458
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,040
I've never seen Dale
this excited before.

459
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,520
This case is the biggest thing
that's ever happened to him.

460
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,280
He really likes you and John.
I can tell.

461
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,320
I think he looks at you
like you're heroes.

462
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,360
Well, we're far from that.

463
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,040
You might want to tell him that.

464
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,480
I have a little girl
who needs her daddy.

465
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:17,600
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV. I read nonfiction.

466
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,960
We better head back.

467
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,000
No, come on, guys.
The night is young.

468
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,920
- You want cookies?
- We all do.

469
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,560
- Very serious meal.
- They're in here.

470
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,720
- I got to go pee.
- Pee off the porch.

471
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,680
Like shit.

472
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,960
You know, Dale...

473
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,520
this case is our problem.

474
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,440
What I'm saying is,
you can be as involved or...

475
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,040
uninvolved in the apprehension
of these guys as you want.

476
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,760
Assuming they show up.

477
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,880
If they do, I'll be there.

478
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,560
You got a nice spot here.

479
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,280
Nice house, nice family.

480
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,680
You're a lucky guy.

481
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,680
I guess I am a lucky guy at that.

482
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,880
I hardly ever lose a coin toss.

483
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,760
I go to the horse races,
bet a long shot and it always comes in.

484
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,960
My mama used to say
I was born under a lucky star.

485
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,200
Here's an article
about Julie from "Dark Memories."

486
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,160
That ain't Julie.
That's that damn twin sister.

487
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,760
No, it's not.

488
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,920
Ma'am, can you tell him
who this is?

489
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,400
That's Julia on "Dark Memories."

490
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,200
I told you.
You got any maps of Houston?

491
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,480
We don't need no map of Houston.

492
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,760
Be cool, Ray.

493
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,080
How are you, Bill?

494
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,480
It's real quiet out there.

495
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,800
I think we got
the two most exciting jobs in town.

496
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,800
Your other burrito is ready.

497
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,960
He's watching me.
He knows who I am.

498
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,520
- No, he doesn't.
- He does.

499
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,600
Baby, let's go.

500
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,160
Back up. Just back up.

501
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,520
Ray, stop it.

502
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,800
Stop it.

503
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,720
Shit.

504
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,200
I'd never get up on a horse.

505
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,880
- Get your hand off me.
- Let's go.

506
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,640
Let's go.

507
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,720
Let's go, okay?

508
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,800
Don't fuck up, man.

509
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,480
- Will that be all?
- That's it.

510
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,720
Is it okay we opened things up?

511
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,640
As long as you pay for it.

512
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,120
You going to drink that beer and drive?

513
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,320
No, we wouldn't do that.
This is for later.

514
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,400
Just kidding.

515
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,120
$7.95, please.

516
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,000
- Have a nice night.
- You, too.

517
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,920
She's too young for you, Bill.

518
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,680
I like them young.

519
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,720
Shit! That trooper is behind us.

520
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,120
Don't look back.

521
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,720
Just be cool.

522
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,640
What if he pulls us over?

523
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,320
He won't.

524
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,120
Slow down, Ray. Don't panic.

525
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,800
He recognized me back there.
I know it.

526
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,960
If he had,
he would have arrested you then.

527
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,080
He's just looking us over.

528
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,440
A white boy and a nigger girl
in Texas. That's all it is.

529
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,480
He's probably running our plates.

530
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,080
542?

531
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,800
Go ahead.

532
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,360
On your out-of-state plate...

533
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,560
New Mexico license number
Nora-Edward-2-4-5...

534
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,120
the vehicle is recently purchased.

535
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,880
There are no warrants.
No current registration available.

536
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:34,600
10-4. Could you check the teletype board
for the past few days?

537
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,240
I seem to recall a teletype
from California...

538
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,760
of a male and female black...

539
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,280
and a male white wanted
for a couple of murders.

540
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,280
Speed up, Ray.
You'll make him suspicious.

541
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,560
Speed up, slow down.
Make up your fucking mind.

542
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,280
Did you find that teletype?

543
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,840
Still looking, 542.

544
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,680
10-4.

545
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,360
542.

546
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,720
I'm going to pull them over.

547
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,080
Fuck!

548
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,560
What do we do?

549
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,080
- I'll blow his goddamn head off.
- Pull over.

550
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,880
We're going to be cool
and play it by ear.

551
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,920
We won't kill him unless we have to.

552
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,280
We're not going to be stupid.

553
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,240
License and registration, please.

554
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,160
Hi, it's you again.

555
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,800
You have a California license and
New Mexico plates and registration.

556
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,720
We had California plates...

557
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,360
but our car died in New Mexico
and we got a new one.

558
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,800
Told you we wouldn't make it.

559
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,120
He wouldn't listen to me.

560
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,760
This one will make it.

561
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,080
Make it where?

562
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,600
Philadelphia. My mother lives there.
She's sick.

563
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,800
Ray, my boyfriend,
got the job of taking me there.

564
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,120
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.

565
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,120
Were we speeding or anything?

566
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,360
No, ma'am.

567
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,960
Then why the fuck
did you stop us?

568
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,880
I want you to get out of the car,
one at a time.

569
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,760
You first, ma'am.

570
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,000
Get your hands up!

571
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,680
Calm down. You said get out.
"You first, man", right?

572
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,520
Step to the rear of the car
and keep your hands visible.

573
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,440
You said get out of the car, so I am.

574
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,680
What's wrong with you?

575
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,120
Do what he says.

576
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,120
Stay where you are, ma'am.
Put your hands on the car.

577
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,720
Spread them out.

578
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,960
Now spread your legs.

579
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,280
Same thing, hands on the car.

580
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,160
Spread your legs.

581
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,040
Okay, ma'am, come back here.

582
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,080
Hey, just what did we do-

583
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,360
Keep your hands on the car!

584
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,600
Okay, ma'am...

585
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,120
Goddamn! Yes, baby! Yes!

586
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,400
You motherfucker!

587
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,920
Let's go! Get her in the car.
Come on! Now!

588
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,480
You motherfucker!

589
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,160
Pluto, we're going the wrong way.
We're going back to town. Turn around.

590
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,600
- Ray, did I kill that man?
- Yes, but you did good.

591
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,960
What the fuck are you doing?
Turn the fucking car around.

592
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,400
The car's been I.D.'ed.
We have to get rid of it.

593
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,200
Yes, you killed him, goddamn it.

594
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,680
Would you fucking turn the car around?
We're going the wrong way!

595
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,720
We'll pass the motherfuckers, get it?

596
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,640
The cops will see us.

597
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,560
We got no fucking choice.

598
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,400
If we head out of town,
they'll catch us. So shut up.

599
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,640
- Mornin'
- Morning.

600
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,800
- How are you?
- I got a hangover, but...

601
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,600
Nothing here.
Quiet as a Sunday morning.

602
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,760
When did you arrive?

603
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,720
I relieved Charlie around four.
You want some coffee.

604
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,240
- No, thanks.
- No.

605
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,840
I was thinking
about what you said last night.

606
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,360
- No wonder you were pissed off.
- I wasn't.

607
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,320
No, you were right.

608
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,080
If that old man hadn't been deaf,
I could have blown the case.

609
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,920
Well, I don't know.

610
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,880
No, I was wrong. You know more
about this stuff than I do.

611
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,880
I don't want you thinking
we're incompetent.

612
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,320
Dale, you have the energy and dedication
of ten cops.

613
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,440
- No shit?
- No shit.

614
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,440
Let me ask you something else.

615
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,560
If I'm full of shit,
you just tell me.

616
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,680
I want to move to L.A.
And join up.

617
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,880
- Join up with what?
- Police department.

618
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,440
Been on the force here
since I was grown.

619
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,880
After ten years of busting peeping Toms,
I'd like a crack at the big time.

620
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,960
I realize getting on the force
is no walk in the park, but...

621
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,720
once we wrap up this case,
and with your recommendation...

622
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,440
well, who knows?

623
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,120
You, me and Macintosh could make
a great team.

624
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,800
That's, uh, that's an interesting idea.

625
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,000
How you doing, Hurricane?

626
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,040
Hey, Larry.

627
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,680
This is Larry Gibson,
our local Smokey.

628
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,640
Larry, this is Dud Cole.
He's from L.A.

629
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,640
- How are you?
- Good. Hi.

630
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,000
Last night, some folks killed
a Texas State Trooper.

631
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,400
It says here they may be headed
for Houston.

632
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,760
They may fit the description
of the folks you're after.

633
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,720
Son of a bitch.

634
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,280
They got a photograph of them
in a convenience store.

635
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,160
- Surveillance camera?
- Yeah.

636
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,760
Texas.

637
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,760
Looks like they're headed
our way, boys. Let's go.

638
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,360
Got another cup?

639
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,080
- You don't mind drinking after me?
- Not at all.

640
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,960
Goddamn. Texas.

641
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,480
Think our people whacked that trooper?

642
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,480
We'll know when we see the photo.

643
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,080
Hurricane is waiting on the bad guys
the way a kid waits for Christmas.

644
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,760
Hurricane is a force of nature.

645
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,680
I like old Hurricane.

646
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,680
He's a tremendous guy.

647
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,560
Guess what he told me?

648
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,200
He wants to come to L.A.
And join the force.

649
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,400
- You're kidding.
- Honest to God.

650
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,240
He said he thought
that me and him and...

651
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,960
"Macintosh" would make a great team.

652
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,880
No shit.

653
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,400
He said he wanted a crack
at the big time.

654
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,680
What did you say?

655
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,960
I told him
it was an interesting idea.

656
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,120
That's the funniest thing
I ever heard.

657
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,360
Can you imagine that motherfucker
roaming around Parker Center?

658
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,640
He'll put a stopper in the bottle.

659
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,600
That yokel won't last ten minutes.

660
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,760
Put a stopper in the bottle.

661
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,160
Hurricane, you know
no one's allowed back there.

662
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,040
- Just getting a candy bar.
- You gonna pay for it this time?

663
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,400
I saw your car parked out front.

664
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,120
Charlie relieved me a half hour ago.

665
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,760
Sorry I put you on the spot, Dud.

666
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,240
Dale, we didn't mean...

667
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,560
Oh, that's me.

668
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,320
This is 210.

669
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,840
I just got back from Little Rock
with that picture.

670
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,240
10-4. That's us.

671
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,440
You leave it.

672
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,360
Jimmy, you got it?

673
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,680
That's Ray.

674
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And so that must be
our mystery girl, Fantasia.

675
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,000
Her name's not Fantasia.

676
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,960
It's Lila Walker.

677
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,480
Hey, Pluto.

678
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,080
What's happening?

679
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,680
How are you, Beaver?

680
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,720
They're cool.

681
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,800
Come on in.

682
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,400
- Come on in.
- Go ahead.

683
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,320
This is Fantasia. That's Ray.

684
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,960
That's Joey.
And the whining one on the couch is Kim.

685
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,640
She had a tooth yanked out.

686
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,480
Fuck you, Beaver.

687
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,440
Grab yourself a chair.

688
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,000
You want to sit down?

689
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,080
That's okay. I'm fine.

690
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,480
So where's this multitude of coke?

691
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,680
- Where's Billy?
- He ain't here.

692
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,880
I can see that. Where is he?

693
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,560
He's still in New Orleans.

694
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,480
New Orleans?

695
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,280
When will he be here?

696
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,560
Tomorrow night.

697
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,200
He didn't tell me that
when we spoke.

698
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,040
He got hung up.

699
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,960
He didn't know that would happen
when he spoke to you.

700
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,360
We'll wait for him.

701
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,840
We can't wait. We have to go.

702
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,240
We'll wait until tomorrow.

703
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,680
We'll stay here.

704
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,800
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

705
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,680
We don't have much room, and...

706
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,240
Yeah, what the fuck, man.

707
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,280
You can have my room.

708
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,240
I've slept on the couch before.

709
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,000
Fuck you, Beaver.
I'm not moving.

710
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,560
Give me the phone.

711
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,160
Sometimes I think you haven't got
a brain in your head.

712
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:05,040
I'm going to Star City. The only reason
I got involved in this shit...

713
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,560
is so we'd get some money and I
could go home and see my people.

714
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,240
That was before
all this shit happened.

715
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,960
Now we have to get where we're going.

716
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,960
So what's the problem?
All you have to do is...

717
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,040
pick me up on the way.

718
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,160
You know that Pluto isn't going to
do that. You heard what the man said.

719
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,200
I think it's a good idea.

720
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,160
If she goes ahead of us,
it will be safer to travel.

721
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,160
We won't fit the description so easily.

722
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,520
No problem.

723
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,120
Ain't that some shit.

724
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,840
Can you make it a whole day
without me?

725
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,920
I don't know.

726
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,400
It looks like just
her brother and mama are there.

727
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,320
What kind of people are they?

728
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,920
Good people. Christian people.

729
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,200
I can't believe she got mixed up
in this shit.

730
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,120
Hurricane, how is it that
you know this Lila Walker.

731
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,280
I arrested her for shoplifting once.

732
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,680
She was just a kid in high school.

733
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,800
All she took was lipstick
and shit to put on her eyes.

734
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,600
Wasn't worth ten bucks.

735
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,880
I could tell right off she wasn't bad,
just high-spirited.

736
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,520
So I decided to try to help her out.
You know, talk to her.

737
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,920
Then one day, she just disappeared.

738
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,160
Somebody said...

739
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,680
she took off for Hollywood
to become a movie star.

740
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,200
Anyway, that was about five years ago.

741
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,760
I didn't hear of her again till now.

742
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,320
She's moved up from stealing lipstick.

743
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,680
I don't believe she killed anybody.

744
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,000
That kid in the closet. She opens
the door, sees him, closes the door.

745
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,000
That proves she's not a killer.

746
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,920
Hurricane, that don't prove shit.

747
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,560
So, do we talk to the mother?

748
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,920
- What if she tips off Lila?
- She won't.

749
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,640
She wouldn't do that, not Lila.

750
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,400
Have you heard from her?

751
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,400
No, I haven't.
Not since last summer.

752
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,040
Some time around June or July.

753
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,520
Mr. Dixon, you know Lila.

754
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,000
She wouldn't do
what they're saying she did.

755
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,320
She must have been kidnapped.
Brainwashed.

756
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,120
Some of the best policemen
in this country...

757
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,360
are after Lila and those fellows.

758
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,320
They'll catch them, too.

759
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,640
It will help Lila
if she turns herself in.

760
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,560
Chief Dixon is right.

761
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,440
We can't promise anything,
but if she cooperates...

762
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,120
that will be
taken into account later.

763
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,400
I haven't heard from her, but if I do,
I'll tell her what you said.

764
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,120
Ronnie, have you heard
from your sister?

765
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,720
No, sir.

766
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,040
Would you tell us if you had?

767
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,440
Yes, sir.

768
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,640
Grandma...

769
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,400
I'm hungry.

770
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,280
Byron, don't bother us now, honey.

771
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,360
Who's that?

772
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,440
That's Lila's boy.

773
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,080
Didn't you know Lila had a boy?

774
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,960
And he's a pretty boy, too.

775
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,240
Thanks for your time.
That's all we need for now.

776
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,160
They're not going to Jeremiah's at all.

777
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,600
No. Fantasia's coming home
to see her kid.

778
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,280
Hurricane, just how well
do you know this gal?

779
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,800
What do you mean?

780
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,960
You know what I mean.

781
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,520
Ha-ha. That's real fucking funny.

782
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,200
Fuck!

783
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,800
Goddamn her.

784
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,440
Ronnie.

785
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,760
Look at you.
You done gone Hollywood.

786
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,320
Look at you, all grown up.

787
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,520
Stand back.
Let me have a look at you.

788
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,760
Yeah, you still ugly.

789
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,480
I'm just playing. You look fine.

790
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,360
I'm feeling fine.

791
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,360
I'm going to see my baby.
I'm going home.

792
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,200
You can't go home.
The cops are after you.

793
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,000
- What did they say?
- Get in the car.

794
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,720
I didn't do the things
they said I did.

795
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,080
I know that.

796
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,440
Being on the run
makes you look guilty.

797
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,920
I already look guilty.

798
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,400
Looking guilty is being guilty
for black people.

799
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,440
You know that.
I won't get a fair trial...

800
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,720
and I won't go to prison.

801
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,120
Chief Dixon said that...

802
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,120
- Dale Dixon?
- Yeah.

803
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,240
He was the one
who came to the house.

804
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,840
Didn't you used to know him?

805
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,360
Yeah, I used to know him.

806
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,600
Ronnie, I didn't come
all this way not to see my baby.

807
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,120
They'll be watching our house...

808
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,640
so you have to take me someplace
outside of town.

809
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,800
Then tonight you bring my baby
out to see me.

810
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,720
Then tomorrow I'll be gone.

811
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,800
Ronnie, please.

812
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,360
I'm your sister.
I need your help.

813
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,240
Okay, Lila.

814
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,440
A friend of mine's grandma died
a few months ago.

815
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,240
She had a house off the highway
past the bait shop.

816
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,160
No one's living there now.

817
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,240
I'll be out there all night,
so don't wait up.

818
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,000
Are Dud and John
going to be with you?

819
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,000
No, they're not.

820
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,200
We don't need 19 goddamn people
to watch a house.

821
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,120
I know you're capable of...

822
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,280
Just because I'm not from L.A.
Don't mean I can't watch a house.

823
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,680
Okay?

824
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,400
I love you.
You know that, don't you?

825
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,480
I know that.

826
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,080
And I love our little girl
more than anything.

827
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,120
I know that, too.

828
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:20,400
I would give you every dime
we talked about if I had the money.

829
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,400
The problem is, I don't have it.

830
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,760
Your partner's making me nervous.
Sit your ass down, ponytail.

831
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,800
I know you guys are on the run.

832
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,760
You need everything you can get.
It's better than nothing, right?

833
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,160
Let's lighten up.

834
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,840
This town is hot, and so are you.

835
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,560
You're on every goddamn channel.

836
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,200
You got no on else
you can trust but me.

837
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,600
I'm going to let you walk with one.

838
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,080
You can take it or leave it.

839
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,000
Fucker.

840
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,960
Eight fucking dollars. Who cares?

841
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,360
He has to have more money than that.

842
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,960
Let's go.

843
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,400
Pull over. We're splitting up.

844
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,280
What are you talking about?

845
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,560
Pull over. Everything's fucked up.

846
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,080
We'll split the money and the coke,
then I'm gone.

847
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,960
I ain't doing that.

848
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,880
Don't fuck with me.
Just give me my money.

849
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,000
I can't do that.
I don't have any money.

850
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,800
- Say what?
- I said I don't have any money.

851
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,960
Where's my money?

852
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:13,440
I ain't got it.
She took the fucking money.

853
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,760
I got $56. She took it.
Now let me go before I have a wreck.

854
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,560
You're a pussy-whipped fucker.

855
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,320
Don't give me that shit.

856
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,880
It was your fucking buddies
who had no money.

857
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,960
Your good friend, Billy.

858
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,080
What the fuck am I doing with you?
You're a pussy-whipped motherfucker!

859
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,760
If you want any money,
you'll have to go to Arkansas.

860
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,480
Lila, we got to go.

861
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,000
Just give me a few minutes with him.

862
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,280
It's almost four in the morning.

863
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,840
I know.

864
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:53,000
It's time for you to go home, go to bed
and get up and see your grandma.

865
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,400
I love you, honey.
Will you be a good boy?

866
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,800
Give me a kiss good-bye.

867
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,560
Come on, Lila.

868
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,960
Take care of my baby, okay?

869
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,720
Will you be all right?

870
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,640
Ronnie, put the money
in the bank, okay?

871
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,600
Ronnie, put the money
in the bank, okay?

872
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,600
Dale.

873
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,640
- How you doing?
- Stop right there.

874
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,000
Turn around.
Put your hands on the counter.

875
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,920
Spread your legs.

876
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,160
Simon says.

877
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,760
Can I turn around now?

878
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,920
Just stay like that.

879
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,240
Where are your two pals?

880
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,320
Ray and Pluto?

881
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,000
They'll be here soon.

882
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,480
How soon is that?

883
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,160
I don't know.

884
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,400
They have to call first.

885
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,760
How do I know you're not lying?
They might show up here any minute.

886
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,560
I'm not lying to you, Dale.

887
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,360
What will you do with me?

888
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,840
Get in the other room.

889
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,720
Go on.

890
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,720
Go into the living room.

891
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,840
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.

892
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,160
What are you doing?

893
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,080
Two fellows from L.A.
Want to meet you.

894
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,200
- Put the phone down.
- Why?

895
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,120
Ray and Pluto will call here
to see if everything is cool.

896
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,480
I won't answer the phone
if you call those cops.

897
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,240
Yes, you will.

898
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,840
Goddamn it!

899
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,560
Lila, even if I wanted to,
I can't help you.

900
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,680
I don't have the legal authority.

901
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,880
You didn't have the authority
to fuck me when I was 17...

902
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,960
but that didn't stop you.

903
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,480
That's right.

904
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,280
Instead of spying on me...

905
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:43,000
why didn't you come in
and say hello to your son?

906
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,440
He's not my kid.

907
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:48,200
Not your kid?
He's nearly as white as you are.

908
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,720
That proves nothing.

909
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,640
Are you calling me a whore?

910
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,480
I was a virgin when we met,
and you know it.

911
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,800
Hear the whippoorwill?

912
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,000
Remember what you said
about hearing a whippoorwill?

913
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,600
It means somebody's going to die.

914
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,840
Why do we have to
sit here in the dark?

915
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:47,160
I don't want to be a sitting duck
if they show up.

916
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,720
I told you,
they won't be here until they call.

917
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,680
- Where you going?
- My cigarettes are in my purse.

918
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,160
- Get one of mine.
- I smoke menthol.

919
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,680
I'll get them.

920
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,200
I forgot that thing
was even in there.

921
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,320
Ray gave it to me for protection.

922
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,040
I don't know how it works.

923
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,160
You pull the damn trigger.

924
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

925
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,440
Did you think I would shoot you?
That's crazy.

926
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,480
Now can I have
my cigarettes, please?

927
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,800
You have a light, baby?

928
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,200
Does your wife treat you right?

929
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,280
Yes, Lila, she does.

930
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,040
That's good.

931
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,000
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?

932
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,560
Cheryl Ann.

933
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,960
That's right.

934
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,840
And you and Cheryl Ann have
a little girl.

935
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,080
What's her name?

936
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,920
Bonnie.

937
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,240
How old is she?

938
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,480
Eight.

939
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,200
You don't like telling me
about your family, do you?

940
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,280
No, I guess I don't.

941
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:45,000
I don't blame you.

942
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,520
- I got something for you.
- Where are you going?

943
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,440
Don't shoot me, Officer.

944
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,840
What the hell are you doing now?

945
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,520
- Can I turn on the light?
- No.

946
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,640
I put it in here to keep it fresh.

947
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,600
Can we leave this open
to get some light?

948
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,680
This is our baby's birthday cake.

949
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,240
I don't want any.

950
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,520
Suit yourself.

951
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,880
It's good.

952
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,200
You should try some.

953
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,920
Today's his birthday?

954
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,120
No. It was in September.

955
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,680
I missed it.

956
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,720
I left him with Mama
before he was two years old.

957
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,440
That means
I've missed four birthdays...

958
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:49,200
so we celebrated all four of them
last night.

959
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,800
Does your mama know about...

960
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,400
Know what?

961
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,200
No, I never told her.
I never meant you any trouble, Dale.

962
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,600
I still don't.

963
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:07,040
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know
she had a half-brother in Nigger Town.

964
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,440
You should have some
of our baby's cake...

965
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,360
Quit calling him that.

966
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,360
Why? That's what he is.

967
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,920
Damn it.
I told you I didn't want any.

968
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,080
- Do you want this?
- What are you doing?

969
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,560
- This is what you want.
- Cut it out.

970
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,840
Cut it out, goddamn it!

971
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,320
Why did you ever fuck with me?

972
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,680
Me and Ronnie's daddy was white,
did you know that?

973
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,160
Of course, we never knew him.

974
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,080
He had another family.

975
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,960
That's why I kind of look white.
Because my daddy was white.

976
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,400
And you figured
since I kind of look white...

977
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,960
you could fuck me,
what the hell.

978
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,800
Because I was kind of black...

979
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,680
you could dump me, what the hell.

980
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,760
211 to 210.

981
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,520
211 to 210.

982
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,480
211 to 210.

983
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,040
Dale, where are you at?

984
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,840
Hey, June.

985
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,560
Juney! How are you doing?

986
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,160
You got something for me?

987
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,040
Hi, Mr. Charlie.

988
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,200
Is this Ronnie? Ronnie, this is Ray.
Is Fantasia there?

989
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,120
Yeah, Lila.

990
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,960
Where is she?

991
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,040
Have you got a number
out there for her?

992
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,400
Give it to me, all right?

993
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,000
Ronnie! Ronnie, come here.

994
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,880
- Come here.
- I got to go.

995
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,360
If you know something
about Lila being here...

996
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,080
you tell these gentlemen.

997
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,520
I don't want you
being in trouble, too.

998
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:59,080
No, ma'am. I don't know
nothing about that.

999
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,200
June Hawkins told me he was
out last night digging frogs.

1000
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,280
Driving back, he saw you driving
in front of him with Byron in the car.

1001
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,200
Why were you out with Byron
at 4 A. M?

1002
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,080
We've been here all night.

1003
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,160
June's mixed up. He's old.
He don't see so well.

1004
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,240
I'll make the bastard talk!

1005
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,600
He won't talk.
It's his sister.

1006
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:26,120
Can I speak to the boy?

1007
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,760
- How are you this morning?
- Fine.

1008
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,120
- Pretty sleepy?
- I guess so.

1009
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,200
- Did you go out with Ronnie last night?
- No.

1010
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,440
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1011
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,520
- You didn't see a pretty lady?
- No.

1012
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,800
You sure?

1013
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,200
- Did Uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
- Yeah.

1014
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,080
So this has just been pretend?

1015
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:55,080
What do you say we stop
playing pretend and play really?

1016
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,600
And you really should spend a night
in jail.

1017
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,720
So you don't tell your sister.

1018
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,360
You got to let me go.

1019
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,000
I can't do that, Lila.

1020
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,800
You can't let them put me in jail.

1021
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:35,080
What's going to happen to our baby
with me in jail?

1022
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,960
Your mom
will keep taking care of him.

1023
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,680
I'll give her money for him.

1024
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,880
Why won't you give him the money?

1025
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:53,440
Why don't you just say,
"Byron, I'm your daddy?"

1026
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,800
I don't see how that would...

1027
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,840
I guess it wouldn't be
a good idea, huh?

1028
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:15,560
I guess it would be better
just to put me in jail...

1029
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,600
and forget about
your 5-year-old son.

1030
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,880
Hi, baby.

1031
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,600
Yeah, everything's cool.

1032
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,840
Everything's real cool.

1033
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:52,880
Ray, where are you calling from?

1034
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,640
What's the name
of the gas station?

1035
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,720
Ray, you missed the turnoff.

1036
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,400
It's about half a mile back
up the highway.

1037
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,160
You turn right at this place
called Cothern's Bait Shop.

1038
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,040
There's a little road there.

1039
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:24,640
You're not far, baby.
Just about ten minutes away. Hurry.

1040
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,680
Yeah, I miss you.

1041
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,760
Is that the road, Byron?

1042
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,120
I don't think so.

1043
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,640
You don't think so?

1044
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:10,560
When they arrive, get them
in the house and away from the car.

1045
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:14,800
Open the door, talk to them.
Let them see everything is okay.

1046
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:18,320
Then stay in the kitchen
until I say to come out.

1047
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:22,880
Then if they get trigger-happy,
you'll be out of the line of fire.

1048
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,240
Then you'll let me go?

1049
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,560
I'll let you go.

1050
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,720
Is that the road you went down?

1051
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,720
Don't fuck around in there.
In and out. Got me?

1052
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:15,080
What do you think I'd do?
Don't worry.

1053
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,080
You sure this is it?

1054
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:34,760
Yeah.

1055
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,880
You got it straight? Do you?

1056
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,480
Hi, baby.

1057
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,640
Come on, Fantasia. Let's go.

1058
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,720
It'll be a few minutes.
I have to pack my stuff.

1059
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,760
What stuff?
All you had was your purse.

1060
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,920
It won't be long.
Come on in.

1061
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,600
Shit!

1062
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,640
I'll be back.

1063
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,520
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.

1064
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,480
She better not have bought
any clothes.

1065
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,880
What does she have to pack?

1066
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,080
- Come on.
- Be careful. I love you.

1067
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:16,080
Did you spend any of my money?

1068
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:20,720
Fantasia.

1069
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,640
Where did she go?

1070
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:27,360
Police officer, freeze! Hands up,
or I'll blow you to fucking hell!

1071
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,960
- What the fuck?
- Get on the floor! Now!

1072
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,600
Who the fuck are you?

1073
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,000
- You bitch!
- Shut up!

1074
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,880
- Shut up!
- Why the fuck did you do this?

1075
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,120
- I'm sorry.
- Stay back!

1076
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,520
210.

1077
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,080
210, A-1 channel 1.
Come in, goddamn it. Hurry up.

1078
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,240
Hurricane, where the hell
have you been?

1079
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,160
I need help out here.

1080
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,920
What's your 10-20?

1081
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,680
Oh, God.

1082
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,560
Dale, what's your twenty?
Where are you?

1083
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:47,400
I'm off the highway,
two miles down Sulphur Springs Road.

1084
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,880
There's a house, and there's woods...
there's this house...

1085
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,800
Is there an address?

1086
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,680
I don't know the goddamn address.

1087
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,720
Just send some help.
And an ambulance.

1088
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,080
I got three suspects down,
and I'm hurt pretty bad.

1089
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,000
Three suspects down.

1090
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,200
You know Sulphur Springs Road?

1091
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,320
Hold on, Byron.

1092
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,400
Charlie, do something.

1093
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:35,120
Dud, come on!
Charlie'll taking care of it. Come on!

1094
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,120
This is 211 to base.

1095
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:51,120
Send an ambulance
to Sulphur Springs Road right away.

1096
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,920
That son of a bitch nailed them.

1097
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,040
Hey, man.

1098
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:23,800
The ambulance is on the way.
I'll get you some blankets, okay?

1099
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,560
Are you dead, mister?

1100
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:42,240
Are you dead, mister?

1101
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,880
No, not quite.

1102
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,120
Where's the lady at?

1103
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,040
She's over there.

1104
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:55,080
Don't go away. Come back.
Come stay with me.

1105
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,040
Stay here with me.

1106
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,680
How did you get blood on yourself?

1107
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,840
I got in a fight.

1108
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:13,000
What do you do with your keys?

1109
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,240
I lock things up.

1110
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,920
Come here.
I can't see your face.

1111
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,520
Come a little closer.

1112
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:29,320
Your name...

1113
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,800
is Byron.

1114
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,960
You're five years old?

1115
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,080
Four or five?

1116
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,600
Five.

1117
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,640
Just come sit with me.
