1
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,771
Who is it?

2
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,277
Fantasia.

3
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,116
Hey, girl.

4
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,046
- Haven't you left for Star City?
- Tonight.

5
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,619
You think you're bad
with that camera.

6
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,778
Come on.

7
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,056
You're ruining the shot
with your lousy dancing.

8
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,955
Bobby, look who's here.

9
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,788
- How you doing?
- Fine.

10
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,135
- Is Ray with you?
- No.

11
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,301
- That's good.
- Real good.

12
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,796
You're always welcome here.

13
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,509
Bobby's about to blow out
the candles on his birthday cake.

14
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,671
It's your birthday?
How old are you, sixty?

15
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,506
That's your I.Q., woman.

16
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,413
This is Darren and Danielle.

17
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,852
I left my purse in the car.
I'll be right back.

18
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,696
What are you guys doing?

19
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,199
Everybody get on the floor
and be quiet.

20
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,936
- What the fuck?
- Get on the floor, goddamn it!

21
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,312
Let it go, Ray.

22
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:39,985
Down.

23
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,317
Fantasia!

24
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,317
Be quiet
and everything will be okay.

25
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,933
Where does Marco live?

26
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:56,958
I don't know.

27
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,832
- I said, where does he live?
- I don't know.

28
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,667
- Where, goddamn it?!
- I don't know!

29
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,070
How do you get your shit?
Does it fly over here?

30
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,510
- Ray, please.
- Danielle and me don't know nothing.

31
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,715
Let us go.

32
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,382
If we tell where Marco lives,
he'll kill us.

33
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:18,317
What do you think we're going to do?

34
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,049
Tell me or I'll slap your head off.

35
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,827
Leave us alone!

36
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,326
You don't have to hit her like that.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,230
Tell him and everything will be okay.

38
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:33,270
Jackie don't know anything.
I deal with Marco, not her.

39
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,734
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.

40
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,251
Who is it?

41
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,179
It's Bobby, Marco.

42
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,248
I got to get some stuff.

43
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,854
- I told you not to come so late.
- Come on, man.

44
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,291
I got to get something tonight.

45
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,966
Come on in here, man.

46
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,629
This is a pretty woman you got here.

47
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,302
Look at those titties.
I like those.

48
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,471
Ray, what are you doing?

49
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,906
- Hey, man!
- I want some of this.

50
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,411
What you want is on that table.
I got $200 in my wallet. Take it.

51
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,312
- I ain't fucking around.
- Take the money and the coke.

52
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,484
- This is lighter fluid.
- You're sick.

53
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,247
I'll fuck her up.
I don't want your little $200.

54
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,427
Fuck you.
I don't want your $200.

55
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,655
Stop it.

56
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,027
- Then you got the money?
- Put it out!

57
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,698
- I'll light her up!
- I'll tell you.

58
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,367
- Fuck you!
- Put it out!

59
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,527
Fuck you!

60
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,705
Motherfucker!

61
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,060
Goddamn.

62
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,396
Goddamn.

63
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,036
Got it?

64
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,609
They got a fucking kid.

65
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,317
Goddamn it.
Where's your kid, you motherfucker?

66
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,490
Where's your goddamn kid?

67
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,821
Go look for the kid.
We can't leave him here.

68
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,090
I've been all over the house.

69
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,827
I don't give a shit! Go look.
He might be hiding.

70
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,987
Mommy! Mommy!

71
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,995
Honey, what's wrong?
What is it, baby?

72
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,997
It's okay. Daddy's here.

73
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,530
Bad dream, I guess.

74
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,376
- It's okay.
- You okay?

75
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,542
I'll take her in our room.

76
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,205
It's going to be okay.

77
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,049
Dale, are you coming to bed?

78
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,547
Yeah, I'll be right there.

79
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,193
Oh, good. Come on, Dud,
let's get to the wallets.

80
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,866
Watch your feet.

81
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,197
I need a name.

82
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:52,707
Let's do this body first.
I think this is our stranger.

83
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,041
What do we got?

84
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,751
John, meet Robert Prost.

85
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,256
How do you do, Robert?

86
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,259
Watch your feet.

87
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,195
We're out of here.

88
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,152
Isn't that a light
on in Robert's window?

89
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,727
Yeah.
10 o'clock in the morning.

90
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,074
Oh, shit!

91
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,576
John!

92
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,340
Anything on that tape?

93
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,173
Background voices.

94
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,339
You?

95
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,185
Nothing.

96
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,015
How did you I.D. This Ray Malcolm?

97
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:48,349
A neighbor recognized Ray's car
parked out front.

98
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,454
Did she see him?

99
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:56,733
She did see a black guy with glasses
come out, get in Ray's car and split.

100
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,069
She didn't know Ray's last name,
but we checked it out with some dopers.

101
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,838
You separated it?

102
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,910
Not yet.
Is that Ray's package?

103
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,578
So who's this black guy?

104
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,744
They call him Pluto.

105
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,543
He's been hanging with Ray
the last couple of weeks.

106
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,746
I'd say he's from out of town.

107
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,585
Pluto? That's it?

108
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,186
For now.

109
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,927
Who's the girl?

110
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,188
- Fantasia.
- Bullshit.

111
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,263
Good-looking. Ray's old lady.

112
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,939
Listen to this.

113
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,812
Hey, girl.
Haven’t you left for Star City?

114
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,643
Tonight.

115
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:49,818
Bobby, look who's here.

116
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,659
She said, "Haven't you left for..."
What?

117
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,319
It sounds like
"Haven't you left for Star City?"

118
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,994
Then the other girl says something.
Play it again.

119
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,669
Hey, girl.

120
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,673
- Haven't you left for Star City?
- Tonight.

121
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,178
It is Star City.
"Haven't you left for Star City?"

122
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,713
Dud, check this out.

123
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,045
A robbery arrest from '79.

124
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,889
In case of emergency, notify.

125
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,393
"Jeremiah Malcolm.
Relationship: Uncle."

126
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,393
"Star City, Arkansas."
I'll be damned.

127
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,902
Jimmy. Jimmy, are you there?

128
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,231
Yeah, Dale. Come on back.

129
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:48,239
I went to the courthouse and checked
the records on Ray Malcolm.

130
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,572
He was born here,
but hasn't been back in 20 years.

131
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,748
I'm heading to the uncle's place.

132
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,455
Do me a favor. Call Charlie, tell him
to come to work early tonight.

133
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,954
I'm staying out there
in case those folks show up.

134
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,890
If they do,
we're gonna be laying for them.

135
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,802
This could be a big one.
I'll talk to you later.

136
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,639
10-4 and out.

137
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,973
Just give their names,
Ray Malcolm and Pluto Franklin.

138
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,976
Say the victims
were stabbed to death.

139
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,807
How many stab wounds?

140
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,080
Don't mention that.
Or the hog-tying and pillowcases.

141
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,258
- And the other three?
- Say they were strangled.

142
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,153
What about the kid?

143
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,624
Don't explain.
Just say someone survived.

144
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:44,692
And that we think the suspects fled the
state. We might get national coverage.

145
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:50,535
You got to give me something.
The press is all over my butt.

146
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,540
- Say they're as violent as we've seen.
- Really?

147
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,377
Thank you.

148
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,880
What's the story
on this Star City thing?

149
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,389
Somebody, come on. Dud.

150
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,127
What if you went down there?

151
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,393
We've been lucky so far.
And we can tie Ray there.

152
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:19,136
I talked to the police chief.
He didn't know of Ray or Fantasia...

153
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,929
but he would check the uncle out.

154
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,265
I'm waiting for his call.

155
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,770
What about an I. D.
On the second suspect?

156
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,115
Pluto. His real name
is Lenny Franklin.

157
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,620
He's originally from Chicago.

158
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,551
He and Ray got busted
about six years ago...

159
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,454
for another drug rip-off.
Same shit.

160
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,019
They did two years together
in San Quentin.

161
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,354
Prison buddies.

162
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,290
Pluto's a piece of work.

163
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,868
I.Q. Of 150
and a college graduate.

164
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,032
We think he did the stabbings.

165
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,834
His package indicates
he's very fond of a knife.

166
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,670
He has three priors.

167
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,748
For some reason,
he left the videotape.

168
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,580
Sick son of a bitch.

169
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,187
There were no prints,
so he left a calling card.

170
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,378
He's here.

171
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,357
Cole here.

172
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,761
Put him through.

173
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,764
Chief Dixon, this is Dud...

174
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,434
I'm fine, thank...

175
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,931
Put him on the box.
What did you say his name was?

176
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:34,702
Chief Dale Dixon. Chief,
I'm putting you on the speakerphone.

177
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,713
Chief Jenkins is here.

178
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,514
Los Angeles Chief of Police Jenkins?

179
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,749
No shit.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

180
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,824
Good to meet you.
Now what we want to talk about...

181
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,154
I guess you're pretty busy
out there, huh?

182
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,330
You got six people dead out there
at the same time.

183
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,661
That don't happen much here.

184
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,102
Sometimes we get a stabbing.
Colored boys, generally.

185
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:10,006
One of them sticks another
over a card game.

186
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,676
We should discuss the...

187
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,509
Craps sometimes.

188
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,549
Now you wanted to know
about this boy's uncle.

189
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,056
I think we hit the jackpot.

190
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,389
I went to the uncle's place.
It's the damndest hideout I ever seen.

191
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,391
It's in the woods
6 miles north of town.

192
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,234
You have to cross
a rickety old bridge.

193
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,561
You'd never find it
if you didn't know where to look.

194
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,774
You city boys would be lost
in ten minutes.

195
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,067
But I'm ready, don't worry.

196
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:41,401
Damn, Bonnie.

197
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,238
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

198
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,246
They were out of onion rings,
so I got you Tasty Taters.

199
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,248
It's L.A., Cheryl Ann.
Chief Jenkins and them.

200
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,185
Yes, sir.

201
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,656
You think this is a promising avenue
of investigation?

202
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,129
It's promising, all right.

203
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,599
Me and my deputies
can set up a surveillance now.

204
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:07,636
Chief Dixon, why don't we hold off
on that until we get a game plan.

205
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,473
If you say so.

206
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,736
That would be best.

207
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:17,309
It's my job. We'll get these
sons of bitches. I'll be waitin' on ya.

208
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,051
What are you doing here?
When did you get back?

209
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,721
- Wednesday night.
- Wednesday?

210
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,891
That's no honeymoon.
You should have stayed longer.

211
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,891
Earl had to get back to work,
and I'm starting a new job.

212
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,893
What are you doing?

213
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,159
Bookkeeping at the Rice Mill.
Muriel retired...

214
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,101
so I talked to Old Man Hosey,
and he hired me.

215
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,442
Take it easy.

216
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,546
Dale?

217
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,273
Well, that's good. Congratulations.

218
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,610
- Thank you, Dale.
- We better be going.

219
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,411
You want some of this?

220
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,584
Why don't you put some clothes on?

221
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,260
I told you to put some clothes on.

222
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,433
Ray, those people are dead.

223
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,432
Those people are dead.

224
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,643
No shit.

225
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,909
And you were there.

226
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,312
Don't forget that.

227
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,151
Didn't I tell you
to put on some goddamn clothes?

228
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,165
We got enough of this shit
to last us until 1995.

229
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,673
We got enough to last
until we get to Houston.

230
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,171
We're not selling this shit.

231
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,848
We're selling it to Billy in Houston.

232
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,714
I'm going to Chicago.
I don't give a fuck what you do.

233
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,056
Riding up and down the road
don't make sense.

234
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,726
What do you think will happen?
We'll get in trouble?

235
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:22,496
I was planning to sell some to them
country sons of bitches in Arkansas.

236
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,897
Man, I don't like
this Arkansas shit.

237
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,239
We'll be in and out.
Don't worry.

238
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,235
We're not building a house.

239
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,738
It's not a problem.
What are you worried about?

240
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,747
What the fuck do you think?

241
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,918
I don't get you.

242
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,522
Why don't you loosen up
and have some fun?

243
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,294
Why don't you get high
with Ray and me?

244
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,127
Don't you want to feel good?

245
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,307
This is the biggest thing
to ever happened to us.

246
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,976
And you just sit there
like a little brown turd.

247
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,314
Goddamn it!

248
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,249
Watch yourself, Ray.

249
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,153
Listen up, motherfucker.
Listen up!

250
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:28,162
This is what will happen. We will
go to Houston and sell the shit...

251
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,333
because this little $15,000
won't last.

252
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,197
Until then,
I will hold onto the blow.

253
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:40,875
And, Ray, I don't want to hear
any more bullshit out of you...

254
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,544
or her.

255
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,218
You son of a bitch!

256
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,221
Fucking son of a bitch!

257
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,062
Why don't you
just go to sleep, fucker?

258
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,738
You forgot just one fucking thing.

259
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:14,408
You forgot about the money.
I have all the goddamn money.

260
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,278
You keep that little $15,000, Ray.

261
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,944
He's right, baby.

262
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,618
We'll sell it in Houston.
Think of all the money.

263
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,789
We'll be okay.
Pluto knows people in Chicago.

264
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,791
We can live off that money
a long time.

265
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,958
Come on, baby,
it's going to be okay.

266
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,971
We can buy all the blow we want
when we get there.

267
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,309
And we'll be safe.

268
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,476
Pluto will take care of us.

269
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,144
We'll be safe, baby.

270
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,552
This is really beautiful.

271
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,881
It's as green as hell.

272
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,551
You know I'm a country boy.

273
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,194
What crap. You were born in L.A.

274
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:41,424
Malibu.

275
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,366
What the fuck?

276
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,613
Howdy. Dale Dixon.

277
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,389
Welcome to Star City.

278
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,551
We got a lot to do,
so follow me to the motel...

279
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:12,529
you can unpack,
and we'll get something to eat.

280
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,625
When I saw you drive by, I knew
you were the boys from California.

281
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,960
Cops looks the same everywhere, I guess.

282
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,669
Follow me.

283
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,172
Oh, shit.

284
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,359
You boys are in for a treat.

285
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,798
Fern, can we get some more biscuits?

286
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,699
- Sure, Hurricane.
- And more coffee.

287
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:57,202
Hurricane?

288
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,367
Some folks call me that.
I never figured out why.

289
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,573
We can wait in the woods.
When the bad folks show up...

290
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,247
we'll put the stopper
in the bottle.

291
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,852
They'll be sorry they came to Star City.

292
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,581
This is good.

293
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,759
My mother used to make food like this.

294
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,757
Thanks. How's Walter?

295
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,759
He had gallbladder surgery...

296
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,763
Good for him. You know,
you boys have my full cooperation.

297
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,272
Me and my two deputies...

298
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:32,269
we'll take turns watching the place
around the clock.

299
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:37,612
So you boys can just relax.
Drink beer, chase chicks, whatever.

300
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,109
We'll help.

301
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,949
- We'll help you.
- Suit yourself.

302
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,948
Another thing. Old Man Malcolm.

303
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:50,154
I guarantee he don't know jack-shit
about what his nephew did.

304
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,088
You talked to him?

305
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:58,929
Not yet. I just know. There aren't
even any telephone lines up there.

306
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,162
He's a hermit.
Hardly ever leaves his property.

307
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,000
We oughta let him know.

308
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,840
- Yes, but...
- Charlie! Get on in here.

309
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,010
This is my deputy.
Retired police officer.

310
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,011
Charlie, this is Dud Cole.

311
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,780
- How are ya, Dud?
- Pleasure, Charlie.

312
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,118
- And Dan Macintosh.
- Nice to meet you, Dan.

313
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,020
John. John McFeely.

314
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,192
Oh, right.
All them Mac names sound alike to me.

315
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,691
- You eaten, Charlie?
- Yeah, Jocelyn fixed me...

316
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,399
Charlie's a Yankee from Detroit.

317
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:34,399
Dale, if we talk to this guy
and he's involved...

318
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:38,005
- I told you he's not.
- Hurricane... I mean, Dale.

319
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,903
These are dangerous people.

320
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,905
I understand that.

321
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,573
You boys about ready?

322
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,182
Just a second.

323
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,408
Here, Fern.

324
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,889
Keep the change.

325
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,958
There ain't no change, Hurricane.

326
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,687
It's a $12-check,
and you gave me a ten!

327
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,292
Catch you later.

328
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,861
Is he gone?

329
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:04,032
I haven't had a full meal
since I met the son of a bitch.

330
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,867
Go ahead, Jimmy.

331
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,800
It's Harlan Childress. Lureen called.
He's raising hell.

332
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,909
Unless he's trying to kill her,
I don't have time.

333
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,475
She said he's trying to kill her.

334
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,414
I'm just letting you know.

335
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,250
Okay, 10-4.

336
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:24,013
I have to make a stop
before we go to the Malcolm place.

337
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,531
Open this door!

338
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,602
Goddamn it! Lureen!

339
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,766
Harlan! Goddamn it.

340
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,441
Settle down, Harlan!

341
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,080
- Let go!
- Settle down!

342
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,314
Harlan, goddamn it!

343
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,829
You calm down now.
Calm down.

344
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,655
Do you want to take a ride with me?

345
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,834
- Calm down.
- He was out all night drinking.

346
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,336
Who are those men?!

347
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,005
It's okay.

348
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,675
She locked me out of the kitchen.

349
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,844
I understand.

350
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:28,175
You were out all night drinking.

351
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,511
You knew she was going to do this,
didn't you?

352
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:35,721
If you apologize, she may let you in.

353
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,220
I will.

354
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,494
We'll go to church, he'll feel better.

355
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,222
All right, Lureen.

356
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,891
What about them?

357
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,000
They're with me. They're from L.A.

358
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,067
Pull yourself together.

359
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,239
Okay. Come on.

360
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,902
Come on. Get up.

361
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,738
Now come here.

362
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:03,251
Do me a favor.
Put this ax back in the shed.

363
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,248
All right?

364
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:09,252
I don't want to have to come
back out here. Are you okay?

365
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:10,924
I'm okay.

366
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,929
Put that ax in the shed.
And fix this window.

367
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,632
Tell Cheryl Ann and the baby howdy.

368
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,234
Tell them hi.

369
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,901
- Sorry about the window.
- That's all right.

370
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,846
It's okay, boys.
I'm out here twice a week.

371
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,711
Motherfucker!

372
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:10,210
Goddamn it! They know me now.
Do you realize that?

373
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:14,547
They know my face, my name,
probably how long my dick is!

374
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:19,186
That goddamn kid! Why didn't you
tell me about that fucking kid?

375
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,560
I swear to God,
I didn't see any kid!

376
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,561
He must have been hiding.

377
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,894
Quit lying!

378
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:30,664
Don't hit me no more.
Pluto, don't let him hit me no more.

379
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,076
Get rid of her, Ray.

380
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,843
- We'll be okay.
- Shut up.

381
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,912
We'll dump the car.
They won't find us.

382
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,878
They won't find you, maybe!

383
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,950
They won't find us!

384
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,883
- It'll be okay...
- Get your hand off me.

385
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,113
We'll be okay.

386
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,161
Isn't there another way, Dale?

387
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,900
Watch your step.
The timbers are rotten.

388
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,302
Yeah, rotten.

389
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,477
I crashed my motorcycle
on this bridge when I was 14.

390
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:13,811
The volunteer fire department
had to get me out.

391
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,644
You can still see some
of the burn marks there.

392
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,028
Perfect hideout.

393
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,689
- Is the old man there?
- Yeah.

394
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,299
- I wonder who else is.
- He's alone.

395
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,367
Dale, wait a minute.

396
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,696
It's okay, boys. Come on.

397
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,224
How you doin'?

398
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,491
You doin' all right?

399
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,224
You doin' all right?

400
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,897
- I'm doing all right.
- That's good.

401
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,263
I'm Chief Dixon.

402
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,594
I'm fixing to do what?

403
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,031
I'm Chief Dixon.

404
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,606
I'm fixing to feed the chickens
before it gets too hot.

405
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,110
You heard from your nephew?

406
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,282
Have you heard from Ray Malcolm?

407
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,613
He's my brother's boy.
I heard of my own kin.

408
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:29,222
When was the last time
you talked to him?

409
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,451
- Who?
- Ray Malcolm.

410
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,024
Ray is my brother's boy.

411
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,795
I got to feed these chickens.
It's going to get hot.

412
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,633
I hope you and them chickens have
a goddamn heatstroke.

413
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,023
Can I help you boys?

414
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,445
"I'm fixing to feed these chickens."

415
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,749
I say, "Have you heard from
Ray Malcolm?" Put that on my plate.

416
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,080
He says,
"Ray Malcolm is my nephew."

417
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:37,691
"My brother's boy.
I guess I heard of my own kin."

418
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,260
So I said:

419
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,530
"Have you spoken to him?"
He said, "Who?"

420
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,031
I said, "Ray Malcolm."
He said, "Ray's my brother's boy."

421
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,432
Imagine the conversation
when Ray shows up.

422
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,430
Rolls?

423
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,468
Is this great or what?

424
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,103
This looks great, Cheryl Ann.

425
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,942
There you go.

426
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:07,455
I hope he does show up.
'Cause I got news for you.

427
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,226
That white trash
and them two niggers are...

428
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,321
Cheryl Ann, you nearly broke my...

429
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,497
Bonnie, pass me the pickles.

430
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,331
I never got any beans.
May I have some?

431
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,686
Did you think I was going to cut you?

432
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,688
I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world.

433
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,172
I'm glad you didn't kill
that car salesman.

434
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,577
What do you think we are?

435
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,599
That don't mean nothing, Dale.

436
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,809
What concerns me is that
we left ourselves so goddamn exposed.

437
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,570
So out there.

438
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,305
I could see the old man
wasn't involved.

439
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:44,418
You can't assume anything about anybody.
That's the guy who will fuck you.

440
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,656
Shit. I've been
police chief here for...

441
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,823
hell, going on six years.

442
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,499
I've never even drawn my gun.

443
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,338
Here we are.
Come kiss your favorite mommy.

444
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,014
Get in the bed.

445
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,520
Get in there.

446
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,546
See you in the morning.

447
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,243
Enjoying yourself?
Gettin' enough to eat and drink?

448
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,074
Just about.

449
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,413
Isn't that your second bottle?

450
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:53,415
Yes, it is.

451
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,917
I want to apologize
for that last comment before.

452
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,286
I bet John feels terrible.

453
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,892
Dale didn't mean it.
He grew up talking that way.

454
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,135
I understand.

455
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,635
I'm sure John does, too.

456
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,638
These people are dangerous,
aren't they?

457
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,806
Yes, they are.

458
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,742
I've never seen Dale
this excited before.

459
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:25,478
This case is the biggest thing
that's ever happened to him.

460
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,422
He really likes you and John.
I can tell.

461
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,661
I think he looks at you
like you're heroes.

462
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,831
Well, we're far from that.

463
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,669
You might want to tell him that.

464
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,269
I have a little girl
who needs her daddy.

465
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:51,604
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV. I read nonfiction.

466
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,143
We better head back.

467
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,311
No, come on, guys.
The night is young.

468
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,346
- You want cookies?
- We all do.

469
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,181
- Very serious meal.
- They're in here.

470
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,513
- I got to go pee.
- Pee off the porch.

471
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,519
Like shit.

472
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,191
You know, Dale...

473
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,872
this case is our problem.

474
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:55,042
What I'm saying is,
you can be as involved or...

475
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:59,872
uninvolved in the apprehension
of these guys as you want.

476
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,708
Assuming they show up.

477
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,920
If they do, I'll be there.

478
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,923
You got a nice spot here.

479
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,926
Nice house, nice family.

480
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,435
You're a lucky guy.

481
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,603
I guess I am a lucky guy at that.

482
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,943
I hardly ever lose a coin toss.

483
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,114
I go to the horse races,
bet a long shot and it always comes in.

484
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,446
My mama used to say
I was born under a lucky star.

485
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:00,503
Here's an article
about Julie from "Dark Memories."

486
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,676
That ain't Julie.
That's that damn twin sister.

487
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,347
No, it's not.

488
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,609
Ma'am, can you tell him
who this is?

489
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,181
That's Julia on "Dark Memories."

490
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,118
I told you.
You got any maps of Houston?

491
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,520
We don't need no map of Houston.

492
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,431
Be cool, Ray.

493
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,932
How are you, Bill?

494
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,434
It's real quiet out there.

495
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:09,936
I think we got
the two most exciting jobs in town.

496
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,113
Your other burrito is ready.

497
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,451
He's watching me.
He knows who I am.

498
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,121
- No, he doesn't.
- He does.

499
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,289
Baby, let's go.

500
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,959
Back up. Just back up.

501
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,462
Ray, stop it.

502
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,789
Stop it.

503
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,795
Shit.

504
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,808
I'd never get up on a horse.

505
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:49,650
- Get your hand off me.
- Let's go.

506
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,484
Let's go.

507
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,653
Let's go, okay?

508
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,818
Don't fuck up, man.

509
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,335
- Will that be all?
- That's it.

510
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,682
Is it okay we opened things up?

511
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,677
As long as you pay for it.

512
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,344
You going to drink that beer and drive?

513
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,689
No, we wouldn't do that.
This is for later.

514
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,853
Just kidding.

515
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,693
$7.95, please.

516
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:54,417
- Have a nice night.
- You, too.

517
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,783
She's too young for you, Bill.

518
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:07,630
I like them young.

519
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,476
Shit! That trooper is behind us.

520
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:29,982
Don't look back.

521
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,651
Just be cool.

522
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,650
What if he pulls us over?

523
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,414
He won't.

524
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,663
Slow down, Ray. Don't panic.

525
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,495
He recognized me back there.
I know it.

526
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,776
If he had,
he would have arrested you then.

527
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,001
He's just looking us over.

528
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:59,509
A white boy and a nigger girl
in Texas. That's all it is.

529
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,678
He's probably running our plates.

530
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,351
542?

531
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,183
Go ahead.

532
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,886
On your out-of-state plate...

533
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,191
New Mexico license number
Nora-Edward-2-4-5...

534
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,862
the vehicle is recently purchased.

535
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:19,796
There are no warrants.
No current registration available.

536
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:24,701
10-4. Could you check the teletype board
for the past few days?

537
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,534
I seem to recall a teletype
from California...

538
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,143
of a male and female black...

539
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,814
and a male white wanted
for a couple of murders.

540
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,983
Speed up, Ray.
You'll make him suspicious.

541
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,384
Speed up, slow down.
Make up your fucking mind.

542
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,224
Did you find that teletype?

543
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,889
Still looking, 542.

544
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,829
10-4.

545
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,906
542.

546
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,401
I'm going to pull them over.

547
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:05,904
Fuck!

548
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,414
What do we do?

549
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,081
- I'll blow his goddamn head off.
- Pull over.

550
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:16,086
We're going to be cool
and play it by ear.

551
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:19,259
We won't kill him unless we have to.

552
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,762
We're not going to be stupid.

553
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,843
License and registration, please.

554
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,845
Hi, it's you again.

555
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:37,367
You have a California license and
New Mexico plates and registration.

556
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,369
We had California plates...

557
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:43,134
but our car died in New Mexico
and we got a new one.

558
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,711
Told you we wouldn't make it.

559
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,108
He wouldn't listen to me.

560
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,812
This one will make it.

561
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,217
Make it where?

562
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:54,887
Philadelphia. My mother lives there.
She's sick.

563
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,218
Ray, my boyfriend,
got the job of taking me there.

564
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:02,729
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.

565
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,892
Were we speeding or anything?

566
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,171
No, ma'am.

567
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,896
Then why the fuck
did you stop us?

568
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:17,077
I want you to get out of the car,
one at a time.

569
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,006
You first, ma'am.

570
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,415
Get your hands up!

571
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:26,245
Calm down. You said get out.
"You first, man", right?

572
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:30,257
Step to the rear of the car
and keep your hands visible.

573
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,428
You said get out of the car, so I am.

574
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,761
What's wrong with you?

575
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,266
Do what he says.

576
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:44,437
Stay where you are, ma'am.
Put your hands on the car.

577
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,106
Spread them out.

578
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,440
Now spread your legs.

579
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,938
Same thing, hands on the car.

580
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,941
Spread your legs.

581
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,951
Okay, ma'am, come back here.

582
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,053
Hey, just what did we do-

583
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,452
Keep your hands on the car!

584
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:09,962
Okay, ma'am...

585
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,660
Goddamn! Yes, baby! Yes!

586
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:15,994
You motherfucker!

587
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,672
Let's go! Get her in the car.
Come on! Now!

588
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,341
You motherfucker!

589
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:41,794
Pluto, we're going the wrong way.
We're going back to town. Turn around.

590
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:45,398
- Ray, did I kill that man?
- Yes, but you did good.

591
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:51,005
What the fuck are you doing?
Turn the fucking car around.

592
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,574
The car's been I.D.'ed.
We have to get rid of it.

593
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,473
Yes, you killed him, goddamn it.

594
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:02,148
Would you fucking turn the car around?
We're going the wrong way!

595
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,317
We'll pass the motherfuckers, get it?

596
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,316
The cops will see us.

597
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,318
We got no fucking choice.

598
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:13,322
If we head out of town,
they'll catch us. So shut up.

599
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,270
- Mornin'
- Morning.

600
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,508
- How are you?
- I got a hangover, but...

601
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:35,444
Nothing here.
Quiet as a Sunday morning.

602
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,674
When did you arrive?

603
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:40,787
I relieved Charlie around four.
You want some coffee.

604
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,354
- No, thanks.
- No.

605
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,188
I was thinking
about what you said last night.

606
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:50,856
- No wonder you were pissed off.
- I wasn't.

607
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,862
No, you were right.

608
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,799
If that old man hadn't been deaf,
I could have blown the case.

609
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,700
Well, I don't know.

610
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:02,868
No, I was wrong. You know more
about this stuff than I do.

611
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,978
I don't want you thinking
we're incompetent.

612
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,549
Dale, you have the energy and dedication
of ten cops.

613
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,777
- No shit?
- No shit.

614
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:19,054
Let me ask you something else.

615
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:22,321
If I'm full of shit,
you just tell me.

616
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,565
I want to move to L.A.
And join up.

617
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,893
- Join up with what?
- Police department.

618
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,599
Been on the force here
since I was grown.

619
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:36,202
After ten years of busting peeping Toms,
I'd like a crack at the big time.

620
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,510
I realize getting on the force
is no walk in the park, but...

621
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:45,414
once we wrap up this case,
and with your recommendation...

622
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,250
well, who knows?

623
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,117
You, me and Macintosh could make
a great team.

624
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,962
That's, uh, that's an interesting idea.

625
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,227
How you doing, Hurricane?

626
00:53:58,335 --> 00:53:59,302
Hey, Larry.

627
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:03,128
This is Larry Gibson,
our local Smokey.

628
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,268
Larry, this is Dud Cole.
He's from L.A.

629
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,335
- How are you?
- Good. Hi.

630
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,847
Last night, some folks killed
a Texas State Trooper.

631
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:16,380
It says here they may be headed
for Houston.
