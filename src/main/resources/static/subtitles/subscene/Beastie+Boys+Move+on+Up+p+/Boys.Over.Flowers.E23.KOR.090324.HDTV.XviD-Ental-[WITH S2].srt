Episode 23

4
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:19,010
Are you OK?

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,146
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:24,779
Even if you weren't OK, you wouldn't say so.

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,792
I'm really OK.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,104
Just wait a little bit.

9
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:35,169
This time, I really...
even if I have to leave home,

10
00:00:35,717 --> 00:00:37,790
I'm going to take care of you.

11
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:40,262
What's that supposed to mean?

12
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:46,030
The evil witch,
it's not her personality to do nothing.

13
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:49,140
She's definitely going to do something.

14
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:52,289
I'm just saying that I'm
preparing to do what I need to do.

15
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,183
Don't be like that.

16
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:55,937
What?

17
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,807
Whatever it is, it should be for your benefit.

18
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,675
I don't like you taking care of me.

19
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,489
Why don't you like that?

20
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,316
You're my woman so obviously,
I should take care of you.

21
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,838
Someone taking care of me, watching over me.

22
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,826
I don't like being dependent like that.

23
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:22,770
Even now, I've already received so much from you,
F4 sunbaes and Jae Kyung unni.

24
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:27,814
It may not be much but I want us to be equals,

25
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:30,405
with me pulling my own weight.

26
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:33,058
Do you know?

27
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:34,095
What?

28
00:01:34,613 --> 00:01:39,682
That you don't have any cute side in you.

29
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:50,221
<i>Hey...</i>

30
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:51,532
What's the matter?

31
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,266
Chan, what's the matter?

32
00:01:53,386 --> 00:01:55,459
<i>Little kid, what's the matter?</i>

33
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:59,027
What?!

34
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,437
Is this the time to be laughing?

35
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:02,912
You... that...

36
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:05,164
Wait, you have to wait.  Come here.

37
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:24,246
<i>Chan, what is that?</i>

38
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:25,741
Can you see that?

39
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:27,874
You can't see it, can you?

40
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:31,676
Hyung, put me on your shoulders.

41
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:32,553
What?

42
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:33,670
<i>Your shoulders.</i>

43
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:37,437
<i>Having fun?</i>

44
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:42,558
<i>He's gonna fall off!</i>

45
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,691
<i>I definitely won't fall off!</i>

46
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:00,723
<i>They're really cute.</i>

47
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:06,508
It must now be Spring.
The weather's letting up.

48
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:08,761
It's strange.

49
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:10,654
What is?

50
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:18,603
Right now, I feel as if I'm
in a scene from a half-remembered dream.

51
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:24,999
I'm just saying.

52
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,909
This little kid is very heavy.

53
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,424
Oh, Chief Jung.

54
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:40,032
Young Master.  You should return now.

55
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,102
Madam President is looking for you.

56
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,769
Go on!

57
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:01,423
Chan...

58
00:04:56,635 --> 00:05:03,582
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.

59
00:05:03,576 --> 00:05:10,647
Beloved Yi Jung, happy birthday to you.

60
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,940
Happy birthday, Yi Jung!

61
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:17,300
Hurry up.  You're supposed to
blow out the candles and make a wish.

62
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,507
This is your present.

63
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:05,941
<i>"One road, one chance"?
What's it supposed to mean?</i>

64
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:10,805
<i>In this world, the one and only destiny.</i>

65
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:24,913
Ga Eul!

66
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:32,268
Yi Jung sunbae, I found it.

67
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:33,605
What?

68
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:36,117
I said I finally found it.

69
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:28,165
<i>"I love you" / "Yi Jung"</i>

70
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:40,539
That day, the sunrise was at 7.

71
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:48,158
<i>The moment the sun rose was
the only time you could see it...</i>

72
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:50,532
<i>That message.</i>

73
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,095
Idiot...

74
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,313
Even when you knew you were being an idiot.

75
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,642
Even when you knew that better than anyone!

76
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:14,733
If you set me this difficult question, what am I supposed to do?

77
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,424
Yi Jung!

78
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:36,201
I'd like it if you came.

79
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,247
The wind...

80
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:46,780
Once it leaves,
it can't return to that place again, Yi Jung.

81
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,428
Do it again!  Do it again!

82
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:53,452
I'm telling you to do it again!

83
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:25,809
<i>Yesterday, there were many families
out enjoying the splendid weather.</i>

84
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:33,186
<i>In city zoo where flowers are starting to bloom</i>

85
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:33,140
<i>{\a6}"Splendid spring weather, many family outings"</i>

86
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:29,340
<i>Sir, are you truly thinking of burying it like this?</i>

87
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,606
Even though they make excuse that was by an insane follower,

88
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:37,473
No matter what,
it won't bring these two back to life.

89
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:44,795
I can't show Ji Hoo that the death of his father
and mother is used as a political warfare.

90
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:46,159
Sir.

91
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,931
All my life, I had no fear at
what I believe that is right.

92
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:14,429
However, even that was arrogance.

93
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:18,476
I realized it after what happened to them.

94
00:11:19,985 --> 00:11:24,206
Because of my fear of losing you as well,

95
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:30,365
not being able to see you was my punishment.

96
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:40,677
As if your grandfather's mistake wasn't enough,
you carried that hurt and lived on.

97
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:47,613
Now, even if I die, I have no more wishes, child.

98
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:53,337
The foundation and the clinic.

99
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:55,899
Can I entrust them to you?

100
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:05,706
To cure heart by art, illness by medicine,

101
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:09,371
that was your mother and father's desire.

102
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,800
Grandfather, I'm not yet...

103
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,709
Come on over here!
The spicy fish stew is all done!

104
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,923
Oh, that girl's voice is quite loud.

105
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:31,946
Because of your voice,
I think that all the fish will scatter.

106
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,676
Ah, this girl!

107
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:35,410
Well then.

108
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,197
- Is it done cooking?
- Yes.

109
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,211
- Here.
- Well then.

110
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:42,960
Tada!

111
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:49,748
How is it?

112
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:53,615
Oh you!  So to not let the fish go to waste,
I'll eat it.

113
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:58,818
Ji Hoo, hurry.  Try some.

114
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,903
It's amazing, it actually tastes like your mother's.

115
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,201
OK, you two!  Look over here.

116
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,792
One!  Two!  Three!

117
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,628
I have good news and bad news.

118
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,901
Which do you want to hear first?

119
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:01,455
Ah, I know Ga Eul's style.

120
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:04,146
The bad one first?

121
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,810
There's a chance that
I won't be as good as before.

122
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,670
This hand...

123
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:23,160
I'm not sure whether God of pot will choose me one more time or not.

124
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,768
No, that won't happen.  It won't be like that.

125
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,027
But what exactly is the good news?

126
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:37,552
That, even still, I'm gonna keep doing it.

127
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:41,773
I'm not going to avoid it anymore.

128
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:46,159
Once one gives up, how much one regrets it...

129
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:48,810
Because of someone, I came to know it well.

130
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:51,067
Sunbae...

131
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,951
Ga Eul, do you want to try it once?

132
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:10,237
My wanting to hear the bad news first,

133
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:12,732
how did you know that?

134
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:18,613
Because all nice girls want happy endings.

135
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:39,036
I may definitely be a cool,
but I'm not a nice guy.

136
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:46,331
Throw away the delusion that
all nice girls want nice guys.

137
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:06,020
<i>Ah, Mom.</i>

138
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:08,199
What?

139
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,189
Is that true?

140
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:13,581
I understand.

141
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:15,757
I'll be right there.

142
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:35,381
I have worked with effort on it since I built the foundation.

143
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:38,749
A lot of people worked really hard.

144
00:16:40,862 --> 00:16:44,510
Jan Di, take a look around.

145
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,820
Yes!

146
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:52,487
It's a great scale, isn't it?

147
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:54,421
Yes, it's very wide.

148
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,717
Oh, what is that, Grandfather?

149
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:58,009
Those are all meeting rooms.

150
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,994
Just a second, just a second.

151
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,044
Yes, it's me.

152
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:07,891
Wait, is that true?

153
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,542
<i>But who exactly?</i>

154
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,343
How did this happen?

155
00:17:16,376 --> 00:17:17,472
No!

156
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,725
No matter what happens,
we must protect the foundation!

157
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,536
No!

158
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:27,964
Grandfather!  Grandfather!

159
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:28,917
Grandfather!

160
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:30,750
- Oh, Grandfather!
- Grandfather!

161
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,225
Grandfather!

162
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,334
Grandfather, your medicine, your medicine!

163
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,287
<i>The medicine... medic...</i>

164
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:38,042
Grandfather!

165
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:41,251
<i>Grandfather...</i>

166
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,671
Sunbae!

167
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,206
Hospital!  Hospital!

168
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:46,419
I said, hospital!

169
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,011
He didn't want you to know.

170
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:44,776
He said that if he was careful, he'd be fine.

171
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:52,731
Let's go and get Grandfather's things.

172
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:19,421
Are the preparations going well?

173
00:19:19,979 --> 00:19:21,474
Madam President.

174
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:27,195
I do not know about other things, but
the Suwon Foundation, if you could reconsider...

175
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:30,293
I'm not doing it because I'm desirable for a foundation like that.

176
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,566
You know better than that.

177
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,928
What do you intend to do?

178
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:41,366
This time, I'll have to pull out the roots.

179
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:46,629
Fortunately, that young child
cherishes something more than money.

180
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:57,871
I have a proposal.

181
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,625
A proposal?

182
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,856
The broken engagement...

183
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:04,986
I feel bad about that.

184
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:06,739
<i>However,</i>

185
00:20:07,517 --> 00:20:11,112
it's not as if things with
JK Group are completely over.

186
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:14,322
I'll do my best to do what I can.

187
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:15,976
Trust me on this.

188
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,066
So?

189
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:23,526
Whether you have me followed or locked up,

190
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,157
I'll accept everything.

191
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:27,452
Except...

192
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,187
Except?

193
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:30,981
Jan Di...

194
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:34,766
leave her alone.

195
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:40,846
If I don't do anything to Geum Jan Di,
will you be satisfied?

196
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:42,560
Yeah.

197
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:45,092
Then I'll promise.

198
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,018
I won't lift a finger against Geum Jan Di.

199
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:51,769
In return,

200
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:54,823
don't you forget what you just said.

201
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:56,896
Don't worry.

202
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,909
Now is not the time to play around like that.

203
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,452
Grandma?

204
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:52,956
Do you still not know your mother?

205
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:56,225
It's not time to feel at ease.

206
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:59,807
You can't even protect your woman.

207
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:04,432
So how will you carry the great Shinhwa Group?

208
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,516
I did not raise you to be such a pathetic man.

209
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:15,379
Just because you were born male
doesn't automatically make you a man.

210
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:19,332
<i>Becoming stronger from losing,
yielding even though it is unfair,</i>

211
00:22:19,452 --> 00:22:22,282
running away even though it is shameful,

212
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:28,023
overcoming a weak self-confidence over time.

213
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:32,609
That's how one becomes a real man.

214
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,998
Do you know that?

215
00:22:42,865 --> 00:22:43,941
Grandma!

216
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,423
Thank you.

217
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:36,574
<i>Ji Hoo - first day of kindergarten</i>

218
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:41,657
<i>Ji Hoo - Entrance day of elementary school</i>

219
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:06,976
<i>Our Ji Hoo - day he became a college student</i>

220
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,848
Ga Eul.

221
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:55,307
Didn't you say that your father
worked at his company for 20 years?

222
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:58,718
And it hasn't been that long since promotion to be general manager.

223
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:07,190
How can they suddenly order
just your father to retire...

224
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,713
Why did that happen?

225
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:29,814
<i>Is that true?</i>

226
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:35,510
She gave pressure to one of Shinhwa's subcontractor to fire Ga Eul's father.

227
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,588
<i>Looks like it.</i>

228
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:42,512
After the way the wedding turned out,
I thought she was being too quiet.

229
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:45,672
So then, Ji Hoo's situation is no joke either.

230
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:47,870
What about Ji Hoo?

231
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,239
President Kang seems to be making
a move against Ji Hoo's foundation.

232
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:52,355
<i>What?</i>

233
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:56,282
The opening of new art center built in Song Do city

234
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:57,615
Then...

235
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,246
All this is...?

236
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:04,034
Just her way of getting rid of Geum Jan Di.

237
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:26,110
Grandfather.

238
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,053
Jan Di, you came just in time.

239
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:32,369
Why?

240
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:34,826
Just now, did you want to see me?

241
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:37,776
This girl, what an assumption!

242
00:27:37,896 --> 00:27:42,022
Jan Di, now that you're here,
take this boy out for a bit.

243
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:46,453
This pole-length boy stays by my side and won't budge.

244
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:48,905
Well, it's frustrating.

245
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:56,483
Why aren't you two leaving?

246
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,656
With the long-awaited spring weather...

247
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:02,483
These pathetic young people.

248
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,349
Aren't you going to leave already?

249
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:15,715
Let's go.

250
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:32,261
The opening of new art center built in Song Do city

251
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:33,697
Then...

252
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:37,803
Just her way of getting rid of Geum Jan Di.

253
00:30:02,297 --> 00:30:04,410
<i>The desire to protect something...</i>

254
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,503
I never thought I'd have it.

255
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:11,490
But after meeting you,

256
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:14,873
it kept coming up, over and over.

257
00:30:16,308 --> 00:30:19,278
Grandfather, the clinic.

258
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:21,786
The foundation.

259
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:23,640
And...

260
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,407
You.

261
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,994
<i>Now that Sunbae has Grandfather with him,
it's really a relief.</i>

262
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:19,838
<i>Sunbae, you don't know, do you?</i>

263
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:25,524
<i>That you were always like the sunshine to me</i>

264
00:31:28,693 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>Goodbye, Geum Jan Di's honorary firefighter.</i>

265
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:53,865
A dandelion lives as a dandelion.

266
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:56,536
And a forget-me-not lives as a forget-me-not.

267
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:59,207
A plantain lives as a plantain.

268
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:05,257
A plantain that lives on the
rough earth can only grow toughly,

269
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:10,683
<i>But on an oily earth, it grows in a
different style with deep meaning and sturdiness.</i>

270
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:17,117
No matter what, I don't lose my
identity and I continue to live as a plantain.

271
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:21,024
I learn it there.

272
00:32:21,144 --> 00:32:24,671
That I have to live like myself.

273
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:36,863
Mister.

274
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:42,026
I don't think I'll be able to come here anymore.

275
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:47,192
I wanted to see you get better.

276
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:51,497
And I had a lot of books
that I wanted to read to you.

277
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,273
I'm sorry.

278
00:32:58,087 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm good at enduring hunger.

279
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,231
And I'm also good at withstanding the cold.

280
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:18,882
But there is one thing
that I absolutely cannot endure.

281
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,607
People that I love getting hurt because of me.

282
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:33,403
It isn't something that can
be solved by me trying my hardest.

283
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,203
Isn't it a bit unfair this time?

284
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:45,012
Mister, I'm not running away.

285
00:33:46,128 --> 00:33:48,480
You know that, right, Mister?

286
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:54,602
You must get healthy even if I'm not around, okay?

287
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:30,634
President.

288
00:34:33,117 --> 00:34:35,051
Geum Jan Di is here.

289
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,097
She came sooner than I thought.
Let her in.

290
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,816
Hello.

291
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:16,690
- Hello.
- Jan Di!

292
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,524
Are things going well?

293
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:21,574
Why are you here?
Is it okay if you just come like this?

294
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:25,304
If I don't die, I'll just keep pushing.

295
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:27,935
Geum Jan Di, fighting!

296
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:31,643
We're always at Jan Di's side.

297
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:36,462
Hello, senior!

298
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:42,066
Welcome, miss Geum Jan Di

299
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,415
Why are you like this?

300
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:48,066
I'm Geum Jan Di.
Senior's apprentice.

301
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:51,450
You are this household's guest now.

302
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,842
But what are you here for?

303
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:55,975
I'm here for Gu Jun Pyo…

304
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,025
Young Master Jun Pyo…

305
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:03,084
I'm here to meet Gu Jun Pyo.

306
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:06,014
Young Master is in his room.

307
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:07,090
Yes.

308
00:36:14,127 --> 00:36:16,658
Jun Pyo, let's play!

309
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:20,401
<i>Gu Jun Pyo, let's play!</i>

310
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:24,151
Now I'm even hearing Geum Jan Di's voice.

311
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:28,972
<i>Gu Jun Pyo, let's play!</i>

312
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,133
Gu Jun Pyo, let's play!

313
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:36,342
Hey!
What's going on?

314
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:38,884
Gu Jun Pyo, let's play.

315
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:40,837
Gu Jun Pyo…

316
00:36:44,186 --> 00:36:46,837
How did you get here?
Why are you here?

317
00:36:47,192 --> 00:36:49,803
Did the witch do something again?
Is that it?

318
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:52,942
Gu Jun Pyo, let's play!

319
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,310
Did you eat something wrong?
What's wrong with you?

320
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,961
Gu Jun Pyo, let's go on a picnic.

321
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:02,171
Picnic.

322
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:09,172
<i>It's a yearning heart, It's a yearning heart</i>

323
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:12,690
<i>Even if you're by my side, I still miss you</i>

324
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:14,124
<i>Hey, my girl</i>

325
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:18,692
<i>Like glass, it's an uneasy heart to me</i>

326
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:21,790
<i>It's a yearning heart, it's a yearning heart</i>

327
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:25,307
<i>Even if you're by my side, i still miss you</i>

328
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:26,825
<i>Hey, my girl</i>

329
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:31,587
<i>Like this, i want to place you in my embrace</i>

330
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:36,060
<i>Your smile that is like the sunshine</i>

331
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:42,226
<i>Your fragrance that is like the wind, your warm breath</i>

332
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:45,368
<i>Your bright eyes.. i like it</i>

333
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,837
<i>Intoxicated in an armful of happiness</i>

334
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:53,463
<i>Just in case this love will become a dream, or everything will disappear</i>

335
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:58,212
<i>I'll tightly hold your hand next to me</i>

336
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:09,990
<i>Stay by my side forever</i>

337
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:13,086
<i>It's a yearning heart, it's a yearning heart</i>

338
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:16,299
<i>Even if you're by my side, i still miss you</i>

339
00:38:16,676 --> 00:38:18,123
<i>Hey, my girl</i>

340
00:38:18,243 --> 00:38:22,770
<i>Like glass, it's an uneasy heart to me</i>

341
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,263
<i>It's a yearning heart, it's a yearning heart</i>

342
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:29,404
<i>Even if you're by my side, i still miss you</i>

343
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:30,881
<i>Hey, my girl</i>

344
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:36,021
<i>Like glass, it's an uneasy heart to me</i>

345
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:38,577
<i>Is today some special day?</i>

346
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:39,753
<i>Hm?</i>

347
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:43,223
<i>I don't know very well,</i>

348
00:38:43,343 --> 00:38:48,525
<i>but don't people usually say that it feels
like their birthday or having won the lottery?</i>

349
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:51,580
Are you that happy?

350
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,696
Yeah.

351
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:55,507
I wish every day was like this.

352
00:38:56,618 --> 00:38:57,914
Think about it.

353
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:00,386
You come to me first asking for a date,

354
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:03,017
and we haven't fought a single time all day.

355
00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:05,621
Yes, we have.

356
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:10,066
Since it has come to this,
can I ask you one more thing?

357
00:39:11,322 --> 00:39:12,777
What is it?

358
00:39:17,072 --> 00:39:20,860
How come you don't say that you like me?

359
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:25,813
I've said it to you… multiple times.

360
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:29,441
Must you hear it in words to know?

361
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:31,534
I want to hear it.

362
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:36,290
I want to hear what kind of person I am to you.

363
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,064
I like you.

364
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,807
No matter how hard I try not to like you,
no matter how hard I try to forget you,

365
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:56,305
my efforts are so fruitless
to the extent that I get angered by it.

366
00:40:58,967 --> 00:41:01,498
Haven't you come here to say something to me?

367
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:05,354
Please leave them alone.

368
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:06,391
What?

369
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:08,902
My friend's family Ga Eul's family.

370
00:41:09,441 --> 00:41:11,813
And Senior Ji Hoo's alter.

371
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,862
Please leave them alone.

372
00:41:14,982 --> 00:41:16,775
On what conditions?

373
00:41:16,895 --> 00:41:19,426
What will you give to me in return?

374
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:22,656
Unless it's a credible card,
I don't want to hear it.

375
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:26,046
I'll leave.

376
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:32,465
I'll leave Gu Jun Pyo.

377
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:37,725
I'll move my school and where I live,

378
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:41,293
and I'll leave to a place where
Gu Jun Pyo will never be able to find me.

379
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:43,266
Is that okay?

380
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:48,694
If you just keep that promise.

381
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:50,568
I will keep it.

382
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,036
Fine.

383
00:41:54,156 --> 00:41:56,410
Then it seems the transaction is complete.

384
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,742
I'm not losing to you.

385
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:01,652
I'm not running away from you either.

386
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:08,999
You are the worst among all people I've met.

387
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:19,857
I'm leaving because I don't want
the people I love to be entangled with you,

388
00:42:19,977 --> 00:42:33,412
and I have only one regret that I couldn't
save the person I love the most from you.

389
00:42:50,202 --> 00:42:51,897
Gu Jun Pyo.

390
00:42:52,017 --> 00:42:52,933
Hm?

391
00:42:55,644 --> 00:42:57,558
Stop here.

392
00:42:57,897 --> 00:42:59,970
Here? Why?

393
00:43:01,972 --> 00:43:03,906
Just stop for me.

394
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,597
What's that bag for?

395
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:37,134
Are you going to give me
a surprise event or something?

396
00:43:39,686 --> 00:43:41,839
Gu Jun Pyo.

397
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:47,509
I'm not going to see you anymore.

398
00:43:47,629 --> 00:43:48,705
What?

399
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:51,436
Tonight's the last time I'm seeing you.

400
00:43:51,556 --> 00:43:53,030
Hey, Geum Jan Di.

401
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,192
Were you saddened because
we didn't fight once today?

402
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:58,684
Even if you're joking,
why do you joke with something like that?

403
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:00,557
I'm not joking.

404
00:44:02,531 --> 00:44:04,245
What's the reason?

405
00:44:04,896 --> 00:44:06,662
Did the witch do something again?

406
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:08,683
I became determined.

407
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:12,929
To take you out of my life.

408
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:14,225
Geum Jan Di.

409
00:44:14,345 --> 00:44:15,720
Thanks up until this time.

410
00:44:16,235 --> 00:44:17,671
Farewell.

411
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,784
Why are you like this?

412
00:44:20,302 --> 00:44:21,884
You told me you liked me.

413
00:44:23,352 --> 00:44:27,135
You said so yourself with your very
own mouth just a little while ago, but why?

414
00:44:29,342 --> 00:44:31,481
It's because of the witch, right?

415
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:32,677
I'm right, right?

416
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:35,926
No, it's because of me.

417
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:37,326
What?

418
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:40,177
I realized it this time.

419
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:43,665
That you and I are from different worlds.

420
00:44:46,555 --> 00:44:49,502
We met through a fantasy like fate,

421
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:54,525
but now it's time that the both
of us return to our respectable worlds.

422
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:57,236
You're lying.

423
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,606
You're lying to me right now.

424
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,057
Tell me.

425
00:45:03,177 --> 00:45:04,851
I'll solve it for you.

426
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:06,945
I'll protect you.

427
00:45:21,158 --> 00:45:22,918
<i>Don't go!</i>

428
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,065
You told me you liked me.

429
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:40,649
Is your love like this?

430
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:43,758
Can you end it so easily like
this after you told me you liked me?

431
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,084
Perhaps my love was up to this point.

432
00:45:50,565 --> 00:45:53,914
No matter how much I like you,
the extent that I could endure…

433
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:57,581
was perhaps just up to this point.

434
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:59,854
Perhaps it was to this point.

435
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:01,414
Tell me.

436
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,241
Setting Shinhwa and me being a plutocrat aside,

437
00:46:07,135 --> 00:46:12,480
have you ever considered me as just one man?

438
00:46:14,553 --> 00:46:15,689
No.

439
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:21,978
No matter how much you try,
you're still Shinhwa Group's Gu Jun Pyo.

440
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:27,320
I have never forgotten that
for not even a single second.

441
00:46:45,731 --> 00:46:49,827
<i>{\a6}Even though i tell it not to go,
even though i tell it to stop</i>

442
00:46:49,947 --> 00:46:53,880
<i>{\a6}My heart keeps going towards you</i>

443
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:52,827
Stop the car!

444
00:46:52,947 --> 00:46:53,918
Jan Di!

445
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:56,011
Geum Jan Di!

446
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:59,010
<i>{\a6}It doesn't wear out, it doesn't decrease</i>

447
00:46:56,749 --> 00:46:58,044
Jan Di!

448
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:03,150
<i>{\a6}Why is my love like this</i>

449
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,951
I'm telling you to stop the car!

450
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:03,519
Jan Di!

451
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:08,016
<i>{\a6}One by one, i count and count the memories</i>

452
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:06,669
Jan Di!

453
00:47:08,074 --> 00:47:12,460
<i>{\a6}My heart can't rest for even a moment</i>

454
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,975
<i>{\a6}It'll just become baggage that becomes hard to control</i>

455
00:47:15,704 --> 00:47:17,856
Jan Di!

456
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:21,420
<i>{\a6}Why can't i even throw them away</i>

457
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:24,310
<i>After I started to like you,
I've always wished it.</i>

458
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,627
<i>{\a6}Really, my heart must have done something somehow</i>

459
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:30,569
<i>That you were a regular man with
no relation to Shinhwa or being a plutocrat.</i>

460
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:30,260
<i>{\a6}I must have become a fool that's blind from love</i>

461
00:47:30,496 --> 00:47:34,896
<i>{\a6}Just one place, everyday one place</i>

462
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,929
<i>I'm sorry for not being able
to keep my promise, Gu Jun Pyo.</i>

463
00:47:35,016 --> 00:47:39,552
<i>{\a6}Looking at the sad light that is you</i>

464
00:47:37,205 --> 00:47:39,258
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

465
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:43,866
<i>{\a6}Even the tear glands must be broken</i>

466
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:48,434
<i>{\a6}My tears won't stop</i>

467
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:53,386
<i>{\a6}Just one word.. the one phrase that you love</i>

468
00:47:53,506 --> 00:47:57,393
<i>{\a6}Can't you just tell me?</i>

469
00:48:01,785 --> 00:48:06,272
<i>{\a6}Even if i hold out my hands, no matter how much i call out</i>

470
00:48:06,392 --> 00:48:10,427
<i>{\a6}You're always far from me</i>

471
00:48:10,874 --> 00:48:15,274
<i>{\a6}It'll be a love that becomes painful scars</i>

472
00:48:15,275 --> 00:48:19,560
<i>{\a6}Why can't i erase it</i>

473
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,273
<i>{\a6}Really, my heart must have done something somehow</i>

474
00:48:24,274 --> 00:48:28,776
<i>{\a6}I must have become a fool that's blind from love</i>

475
00:48:28,896 --> 00:48:33,260
<i>{\a6}Just one place, everyday one place</i>

476
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,154
<i>{\a6}Looking at the sad light that is you</i>

477
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:42,051
<i>{\a6}Even the tear glands must be broken</i>

478
00:48:42,171 --> 00:48:46,690
<i>{\a6}My tears won't stop</i>

479
00:48:44,918 --> 00:48:46,612
Jan Di.

480
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:50,541
Grandpa's here. Where are you?

481
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,834
Jan Di.

482
00:48:53,571 --> 00:48:55,226
Where is this rascal?

483
00:48:56,278 --> 00:49:04,462
<i>{\a6}I try to comfort myself with the lie that i'm happy if you just smile</i>

484
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:09,065
<i>{\a6}Because the place you're going towards is not me</i>

485
00:49:07,518 --> 00:49:10,290
<i>I apologize for leaving like this.</i>

486
00:49:09,185 --> 00:49:14,981
<i>{\a6}The lonely tears flow</i>

487
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:13,240
<i>I was indebted to your for a long time</i>

488
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,731
<i>I won't forget it</i>

489
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:18,841
<i>Please be healthy.</i>

490
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:24,828
<i>{\a6}I must have gone crazy over this hard love</i>

491
00:49:24,881 --> 00:49:29,803
<i>{\a6}Can't have you, can't forget you</i>

492
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:33,624
<i>{\a6}Waiting for you day by day</i>

493
00:49:33,744 --> 00:49:38,237
<i>{\a6}I must have gotten ill from missing you so much</i>

494
00:49:38,357 --> 00:49:42,623
<i>{\a6}From loving you too much</i>

495
00:49:42,743 --> 00:49:47,873
<i>{\a6}Just one thing.. your heart, that one thing</i>

496
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:52,302
<i>{\a6}Can't you just share it with me</i>

497
00:49:52,304 --> 00:49:58,644
<i>{\a6}Can't you love me?</i>

498
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:28,777
I'm telling you that it's real.

499
00:50:28,897 --> 00:50:30,870
Why don't you believe me?

500
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,801
She's starting again.

501
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:36,330
Why are you here like this if
you have your plutocrat in-law's house?

502
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,004
<i>And is it even a normal plutocrat?</i>

503
00:50:38,124 --> 00:50:39,758
Shinhwa Group!

504
00:50:39,878 --> 00:50:43,415
Then my daughter in law's
Jun Sul Group's daughter.

505
00:50:43,535 --> 00:50:46,405
My daughter goes to Shinhwa High School!

506
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:49,794
I even made food for Shinhwa Group's Gu Jun Pyo.

507
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:52,086
Why can't you believe me?

508
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:54,405
Okay. We understand.

509
00:50:54,525 --> 00:50:59,249
Then go to your in law and
tell him to pay your debts for you.

510
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:02,997
Then no one will know what will happen to you.

511
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:08,925
Welcome.
What should I give you?

512
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:10,978
Give me one of these.

513
00:51:16,134 --> 00:51:17,809
Here you go.

514
00:51:27,404 --> 00:51:28,739
Who is that?

515
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,829
They came down around the same time you came down.

516
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:34,460
<i>They say he's some company's president.</i>

517
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,874
M…. M… anyway.

518
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:43,057
They say he went bankrupt because of being eaten by a big company.

519
00:51:43,177 --> 00:51:46,047
He got divorced and got
all his children taken away.

520
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:48,058
He was crippled.

521
00:51:48,178 --> 00:51:49,374
<i>What can we do?</i>

522
00:51:49,494 --> 00:51:53,400
Seeing that he's wandering around like this,

523
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,570
I'm guessing that he's
being chased by loan sharks.

524
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,773
What a pity.

525
00:51:57,893 --> 00:52:00,185
Think about yourself.

526
00:52:00,305 --> 00:52:02,955
Are you in the position to worry about others?

527
00:52:03,075 --> 00:52:04,670
That's true.

528
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:43,718
Isn't that Jan Di?

529
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:48,761
Oh my.
Jan Di!

530
00:52:48,881 --> 00:52:50,286
Mom!

531
00:52:54,412 --> 00:52:55,568
How did you get here?

532
00:52:55,688 --> 00:52:57,502
I came because I wanted to see you.

533
00:52:57,622 --> 00:52:59,706
Is she the daughter that you were talking about?

534
00:52:59,826 --> 00:53:02,178
Yeah. She's the girl.

535
00:53:02,298 --> 00:53:03,633
Wanna see?

536
00:53:04,689 --> 00:53:06,742
Look at this. Look at this.

537
00:53:06,862 --> 00:53:08,636
Shinhwa High School's uniform!

538
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:10,450
<i>Oh my, oh my. It must be true
that she goes to Shinhwa High School.</i>

539
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,586
Yeah!

540
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,610
Jan Di, let's go and talk.

541
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,862
Watch my shop for me.

542
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:18,999
Okay, go on.

543
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,620
Don't worry about it.

544
00:53:24,776 --> 00:53:26,391
Watch after it for me!

545
00:53:26,511 --> 00:53:28,923
How did you get here, Jan Di?

546
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:31,514
She overflows a noble figure.

547
00:53:32,697 --> 00:53:33,973
What?

548
00:53:34,332 --> 00:53:36,166
Dad is on a boat?

549
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:38,019
<i>Then what can we do?</i>

550
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:40,391
<i>The debts keep rising.</i>

551
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:42,273
And we need to send Kang San to school.

552
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:44,625
And it looks like we can't
even feed our family of three.

553
00:53:44,745 --> 00:53:46,240
Then how come you didn't tell me?

554
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,393
So what if I tell you?
You'll only get upset.

555
00:53:48,513 --> 00:53:51,961
I would've quit school
or gotten a job at the least.

556
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:54,144
That's why I didn't tell you
because I was afraid you'd do that.

557
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:57,436
You need to graduate from Shinhwa
High School and go to Shinhwa college,

558
00:53:57,556 --> 00:53:59,449
so that you can marry Young
Master Jun Pyo or some other plutocrat,

559
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:03,157
and then we'll have a way for our family to live.

560
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:04,592
That's our lifeline.

561
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:08,861
Mom, does that make any sense at all?

562
00:54:09,798 --> 00:54:14,044
Why did you come down here
all of a sudden and not go to school?

563
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:17,273
I came because I wanted to see you.

564
00:54:17,393 --> 00:54:19,739
Mom, Dad, San.

565
00:54:24,742 --> 00:54:29,606
Darling, our daughter Jan Di's here!

566
00:54:30,742 --> 00:54:33,354
You're doing well, right?

567
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,694
Dad!

568
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:43,066
<i>I'm here!</i>

569
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:45,458
<i>You're doing well, right?</i>

570
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:49,301
Please take care of yourself!

571
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:51,912
Dad!

572
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:55,160
Dad!

573
00:54:57,532 --> 00:54:58,987
Dad…

574
00:55:06,806 --> 00:55:08,341
Any news of Jan Di?

575
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:09,956
Have you heard any?

576
00:55:10,076 --> 00:55:11,247
Not really.

577
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:15,772
I've searched everywhere,
and it's not easy as you think.

578
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:17,721
She hid herself somewhere.

579
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:22,106
I think it's the first time
that Jun Pyo's been down like this.

580
00:55:22,226 --> 00:55:23,761
He wasn't this bad in Macao either.

581
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:25,176
You're right.

582
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:29,284
It seems like he's holding a time bomb
and teetering that I can't bear to look at him.

583
00:55:29,404 --> 00:55:31,397
Ji Hoo's strange as well.

584
00:55:31,517 --> 00:55:33,590
Isn't he doing well with his grandpa?

585
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:38,479
Do you think it's normal for Ji Hoo to take management lesson and commute to the clinic?

586
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:45,117
I'm more worried about the rascal that just
slept or played instruments more than Jun Pyo.

587
00:55:45,237 --> 00:55:46,432
You're right.

588
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,691
Anyway, you're amazing Geum Jan Di.

589
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:52,279
She disappeared after plunging
the great F4 into bewilderment.

590
00:56:20,286 --> 00:56:22,379
Yes, Grandpa, it's me.

591
00:56:23,395 --> 00:56:25,807
Yes, I'll go get you right now.

592
00:57:07,939 --> 00:57:09,096
What should I do?

593
00:57:09,216 --> 00:57:12,440
Jan Di came down after such a long time,
and all I have for side dishes is this.

594
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,155
What about the side dishes?

595
00:57:14,573 --> 00:57:18,580
I'm dying of happiness to just eat food with you.

596
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:20,784
How long are you going to stay?

597
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,818
I wish that you'd stay for a long time.

598
00:57:23,157 --> 00:57:24,891
I'm going to stay here for a while.

599
00:57:25,011 --> 00:57:28,000
Stay for a while? You have to go to school.

600
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,277
Don't worry about the family
and just do what you have to do.

601
00:57:31,775 --> 00:57:33,549
<i>Are you there, Kang San's family?</i>

602
00:57:33,669 --> 00:57:35,064
Who is it?

603
00:57:41,148 --> 00:57:42,523
We're here.

604
00:57:42,643 --> 00:57:44,297
What's going on?

605
00:57:45,553 --> 00:57:47,307
She's full of a noble figure

606
00:57:47,427 --> 00:57:50,237
She really must be a plutocrat's daughter in law.

607
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:53,324
<i>They say that only wealthy
people go to Shinhwa high school.</i>

608
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:56,992
<i>Then you must be friends
with all those rich kids, right?</i>

609
00:57:57,331 --> 00:58:01,158
She said that she is dating
with Shinhwa group's inheritor!

610
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:07,980
I never dreamed that I would meet Shinhwa group's
in laws while living in the countryside like this.

611
00:58:08,461 --> 00:58:10,392
<i>Of course, of course.</i>

612
00:58:10,512 --> 00:58:12,141
Eat this.

613
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:15,968
And you can pay back the money slowly.

614
00:58:16,088 --> 00:58:17,558
Oh my, really?

615
00:58:17,678 --> 00:58:19,153
Of course.

616
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:20,887
Okay.

617
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:22,636
<i>Accept it.
Accept this too.</i>

618
00:58:22,756 --> 00:58:23,972
<i>This too.</i>

619
00:58:24,092 --> 00:58:25,805
<i>There's more here.</i>

620
00:58:33,473 --> 00:58:36,164
What is all this in the middle of the night?

621
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:49,705
Oppa.

622
00:58:53,964 --> 00:59:05,077
<i>Today you ask me about my welfare as if it's so normal</i>

623
00:59:07,561 --> 00:59:12,440
<i>I just said that i was okay</i>

624
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:19,475
<i>You really don't know me at all</i>

625
00:59:21,618 --> 00:59:28,032
<i>Without you, do you really think i'd be okay?</i>

626
00:59:28,576 --> 00:59:33,874
<i>{\a6}Are you okay without me?</i>

627
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:34,540
-You got it!
-I got it!

628
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:35,835
Got it!

629
00:59:35,602 --> 00:59:42,072
<i>{\a6}Because the world without you is so hard</i>

630
00:59:42,192 --> 00:59:49,247
<i>I resent myself who's breathing</i>

631
00:59:49,614 --> 00:59:51,003
<i>What do i do? </i>

632
00:59:51,365 --> 00:59:56,374
Still, i live in the day that breaks apart at your one word

633
00:59:57,848 --> 00:59:59,801
You said that you liked me.

634
00:59:59,921 --> 01:00:02,094
Is your love like this?

635
01:00:02,214 --> 01:00:05,474
Can you end it so easily like
this after you told me you liked me?

636
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:09,401
Perhaps my love was up to this point.

637
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:19,950
No matter how much I like you,
the extent that I could endure…

638
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:24,416
was perhaps just up to this point.

639
01:00:34,745 --> 01:00:36,100
What on earth is he doing?

640
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,595
<i>Young Master, why are you like this?</i>

641
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:39,319
<i>How can he mess up someone else's machine?</i>

642
01:00:39,439 --> 01:00:41,053
Don't touch me!

643
01:01:03,553 --> 01:01:07,122
How come you don't say that you like me?

644
01:01:07,242 --> 01:01:10,331
Must you hear it in words to know?

645
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:12,025
I want to hear it.

646
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:16,994
I want to hear what kind of person I am to you.

647
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:24,230
I like you.

648
01:01:26,077 --> 01:01:30,517
<i>No matter how hard I try not to like you,
no matter how hard I try to forget you,</i>

649
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:36,445
<i>my efforts are so fruitless
to the extent that I get angered by it.</i>

650
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,797
Jun Pyo.

Can you send her?

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

659
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:43,031
Can you send her?

660
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:45,602
Hyung, stop joking around.

661
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:48,452
- Ji Hoo, kiss him!
- Go away!

662
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:50,525
I don't want to!

663
01:02:55,482 --> 01:02:57,670
The shock must've been big on him.

664
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:00,785
Hey, hey, hey!

665
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:06,167
Hey Jihoo, he was hit!

666
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:08,739
Do you think that makes any sense?

667
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:11,848
The monkey that asked Jan Di to be her bridesmaid…

668
01:03:11,968 --> 01:03:12,945
I'm sorry.

669
01:03:13,065 --> 01:03:14,659
<i>It keeps hitting me.</i>

670
01:03:14,779 --> 01:03:16,409
