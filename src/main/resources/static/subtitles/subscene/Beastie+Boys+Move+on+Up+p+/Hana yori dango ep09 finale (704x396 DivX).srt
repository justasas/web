1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,996
T-O-J?

2
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:05,519
This competition is organised to select
Japan's top high school student.

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,508
If she wins, you'll allow her to continue her
association with Tsukasa,

4
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,538
and you will also stop harassing Makino.

5
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:13,463
It's not worth gambling for.

6
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:14,609
I'll help sharpen you.

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:15,580
We will all be beside you.

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,338
I told you that if something happens,
you can always come to me for help.

9
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:20,970
Why are you suddenly closing down our business?

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,182
It's because of your mom that so many
innocent people got involved.

11
00:00:24,182 --> 00:00:26,783
If we, the F4, are on your side,
what's there to be afraid of?

12
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:28,393
Just be yourself and do it.

13
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:30,467
Tsukasa!

14
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:33,905
Kurimaki Ayano. Tsukasa's fiance.

15
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,821
<Last episode>

16
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:41,717
<TOJ
Teen of Japan
2005>

17
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:45,360
May I have everyone's attention.

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,583
We now have the participants of Teen of Japan 2005,

19
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:52,553
who will fight for the title of Japan's Top High School Student.

20
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:56,475
It's Tsukushi!
Tsukushi!

21
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:58,958
- Do your best!
- Onee-san!

22
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:04,851
Yuriko!

23
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:06,041
Where's Tsukasa?

24
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,665
He's in the toilet.

25
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:12,041
Maybe because he's too nervous.

26
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:15,059
But then, if Ayano is participating...

27
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:18,401
What's the relationship between that pretty girl
and Tsukasa?

28
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:20,455
She's Tsukasa's fiance.

29
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,388
Fiance?

30
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:23,722
Tsukushi!

31
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:26,282
<Do your best!!
Makino Tsukushi>

32
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,250
You b*stards, what are you going to do with me?

33
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,127
I'm sorry, Young Master. Please calm down.

34
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:46,000
Nishida, what's the meaning of this?!

35
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:47,445
It hurts...!

36
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:55,042
Next, we have the main judge of TOJ,
Yamanaka Minako to start the competition.

37
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:58,868
I hope that all the participants will be able to display

38
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:04,258
their beauty, knowledge, and homemaking skills,
as much as possible.

39
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:08,897
Teen of Japan 2005 will now begin!

40
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:20,625
This year's competition will be slightly different
from the previous years.

41
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:23,569
Previously, there were 3 categories for judging.

42
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,265
But this year, there will be four.

43
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:30,320
The first challenge for everyone is...

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,935
A talent show.

45
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:36,510
You have only one minute to perform.
Please show the audience what you do best.

46
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,803
It just started, and it's already a surprise.

47
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:42,184
Please take the next 30 seconds to prepare.

48
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:44,542
Hey hey, I didn't hear about this.

49
00:02:46,585 --> 00:02:49,351
Alright!

50
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:55,083
Before the results came out, Ma'am wanted to make sure...

51
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:57,544
What's that stupid "baba" up to?!

52
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:21,956
Yuriko!

53
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,184
Sanjyo Sakurako isn't bad.

54
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,722
Being young is still the best after all.

55
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:46,272
That's not what I meant.

56
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,249
This is bad...

57
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:56,744
What should I do?

58
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:02,011
Next, Makino Tsukushi-san!

59
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:04,207
You're the third one.

60
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:12,333
That isn't too nice, forcefully bringing Tsukasa
back at a time like this.

61
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,334
Anyway, she'll never win.

62
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:19,662
The only person who thinks that way is you.

63
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:29,098
Hey hey, what's Makino up to?

64
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:33,917
I've decided to demonstrate to everyone
how to deal with perverts.

65
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,368
Doing that at a competition which picks
the top high school student.

66
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,917
Not really, it could be very interesting.

67
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,520
Please go ahead.

68
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:52,173
Wait a minute!

69
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,833
Tsukasa has changed a lot ever since
he started the relationship with Tsukushi.

70
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:10,674
What exactly do you mean?

71
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:15,100
Tsukasa truly likes Tsukushi.

72
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,214
He became more gentleman-like because of his love for Tsukushi,

73
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:23,015
even though he usually doesn't care about other people's feelings.

74
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:27,958
Okka High, Nakazawa Atsuka-san.

75
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:32,328
Eiri High, Kurimaki Ayano-san.

76
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:33,201
Here.

77
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:37,659
Eitoku High, Sanjyo Sakurako-san.

78
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,618
All the great things about Tsukushi,

79
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:42,475
you are the only one who hasn't realised them.

80
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:46,566
Eitoku High, Makino Tsukushi-san.

81
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,583
It's necessary for every modern independent woman
to know how to defend herself against perverts.

82
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:56,714
Great!

83
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,363
Way to go!

84
00:05:58,363 --> 00:05:59,536
Yes!

85
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,225
<First Category>

86
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:07,601
Tsubaki-san, be careful of your stand.

87
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:16,147
If that girl wins,

88
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:20,041
I'll seriously consider whatever you've said.

89
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:24,034
However, if she doesn't win...

90
00:06:25,796 --> 00:06:28,034
That's reality for you...

91
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,705
Ma'am.

92
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:39,631
Tsukasa.

93
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:41,766
Tsubaki-san, you leave first.

94
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:51,562
If I didn't do this, he'd never listen to me.

95
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,917
Next, we have the Beauty category.

96
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:03,750
Please select your choice of clothing from those available,

97
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,118
and then display your style to everyone.

98
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:07,990
A time challenge?

99
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,583
That girl might win, since she's really good
at getting bargains when buying clothes.

100
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:14,046
Yep. She often goes to the local store to get them.

101
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:17,224
But those are all branded clothes from the Paris Collection.

102
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,699
Paris Collection?

103
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,872
You have 3 minutes to make your selection.

104
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:25,231
Please proceed backstage to change after you are done.

105
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:28,046
Well then, please begin now.

106
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:35,246
You can't expect less of Ayano, it's like she's used to this.

107
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,583
Those are nothing to her.

108
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,365
Makino seems very lost.

109
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,749
Which one is good?

110
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:53,000
Hey! There isn't all the time in the world!

111
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,641
Not good...

112
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,820
Heck, this one then.

113
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:02,872
Why do you intend to do?

114
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:07,755
I will protect Makino no matter what.

115
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:13,458
Ayano-chan is there. So she has no chance of winning.

116
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,849
Makino is the type who will always do her best
no matter what cirumstances she is in.

117
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:22,974
Well then, if Makino is unable to win...

118
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:29,894
If she doesn't win, you must do as I say.

119
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:33,050
Makino, congratulations.

120
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,436
Thanks.

121
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:39,491
If you win this, you'll be able to get the approval of

122
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:42,506
Domyoji's mom to let you and him continue your relationship.

123
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:46,185
It's not really because of that...

124
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:49,887
The whole of Eitoku High knows about it.

125
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:54,958
I've got to do my best, since I'm representing Eitoku High.

126
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,134
Umm...

127
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,503
Sorry. I've never greeted you properly before.

128
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,817
My name is Kurimaki Ayano.

129
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:10,458
Ah. I'm Makino Tsukushi. Nice to meet you.

130
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,444
I know this might be a bit impolite,

131
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:15,229
what's going on between you and Tsukasa?

132
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,750
Right now, she's the one that Domyoji-san loves.

133
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,078
Ah... No... I...

134
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,658
Eh?!

135
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:31,730
If she does win, I'll agree to whatever you say.

136
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:39,375
Otherwise, you must listen to me.

137
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:41,530
Any problems?

138
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:51,700
Are you alright, Makino-san?

139
00:09:53,420 --> 00:10:00,250
That girl can go ahead and win, and everything will be fine.

140
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:15,756
Really... Unbelievable...

141
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:24,250
Hana Yori Dango - Boys Over Flowers
Episode 9 - Season Finale

142
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,417
Timing and Translation ** Backalley

143
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:32,583

Editing and Release ** furransu

145
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:45,083
Next we have... Kurimaki Ayano-san.

146
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:58,398
She lives up to her name.

147
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:01,329
Did you like her previously?

148
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,312
I'm really right?

149
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,742
D*mmit...

150
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,651
Makino-san from Eitoku High, please get ready.

151
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:17,288
Yes!

152
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:21,830
I got it.

153
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,439
You must be a man of your word.

154
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,853
That goes for you too, don't eat your own words.

155
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:48,647
She appears to be very cute, but she actually looks quite weird.

156
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,336
You're absolutely right.

157
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:52,748
Don't tell me your fashion tastes are the same as mine?

158
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:56,392
Back in my younger days, I used to dress up just like her.

159
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,257
Next we have...

160
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:07,213
Also from Eitoku High... Makino Tsukushi-chan.

161
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:10,603
What on earth is she wearing?

162
00:12:10,603 --> 00:12:13,190
It seems like she purposely cut up her clothes for that.

163
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:17,572
Is she counting on that to impress the judges?

164
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:23,542
She's guaranteed to be knocked out, dressing in those clothes.

165
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,656
Not bad, Makino.

166
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:27,496
That's very ingenious of you.

167
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:35,625
It seems like the world renowned designer has something to say.

168
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:45,530
What is he saying?

169
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,588
He seems very upset.

170
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,983
Nope. He's praising her.

171
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:51,284
It's magnificent!!

172
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:55,153
Fantastic! This is the design I've always been dreaming of.

173
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:00,596
Makino Tsukushi-san from Eitoku High

174
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:02,834
automatically qualifies for the next round.
<The Second Category>

175
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:04,710
No way...

176
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,616
Yes!!

177
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:17,105
Did I get that right?

178
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:21,792
And finally, we have Maekawa Sonoko-san Vuru High.

179
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:25,203
These five participants will go on to the next round.

180
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:27,502
Will everyone please give these 5 a round of applause.

181
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:29,859
Sanjyo Sakurako has been eliminated.

182
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:33,378
As she is now, how can she even win?

183
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:35,876
But I didn't expect Makino to qualify,

184
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,388
even though she was mainly depending on luck.

185
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:40,153
The next category tests one's knowledge and proficiency

186
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,756
of English in a speech.

187
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:46,768
The speech is titled "Unfortunate Children".

188
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:49,822
"Unfortunate Children"?

189
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:53,778
Before we begin, each contestant is given 15 minutes to prepare.

190
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:17,170
Makino-san, you really look good,

191
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,645
in the way you wore those clothes.

192
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:20,069
Thanks.

193
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:24,329
I really admire your creativity and spontaneity.

194
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:32,542
However, I flew thousands of miles to get here,
so as to win this competition.

195
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:35,131
I'm Tsukasa's fiance anyway.

196
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,493
If Tsukasa really loves you as much as they say he does,

197
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:43,180
then all the more I cannot lose to you.

198
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,688
Let us fight this out fair and square.

199
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:05,691
Tsukushi-chan.

200
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,430
Sakurako.

201
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,757
You're writing your draft in Japanese.

202
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:15,555
Mm. I'll translate it to English once I'm done.

203
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:17,311
Let me help you.

204
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:22,417
Don't forget that I've been overseas for a long period of time.

205
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:32,625
It seems that Domyoji-san's mom recommended
Kurimaki Ayano for this competition.

206
00:15:35,238 --> 00:15:37,220
So it seems.

207
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,377
But, she really is very pretty.

208
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:45,074
No wonder Domyoji's mom likes her.

209
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:46,462
Tsukushi-chan.

210
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,488
You definitely must win.

211
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,785
I'm honestly supporting you.

212
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,723
Sakurako.

213
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:58,501
I'd have no chance at all if I had to contest with Kurimaki Ayano.

214
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:04,292
I'll be doomed if she really wins and together with Domyoji...

215
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:09,417
But if you win, then maybe there's still some chance left for me.

216
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:22,206
<The Third Category>

217
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:25,335
Next, the third round is about to begin.

218
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:31,075
At the same time,
there are more unfortunate children in the world.

219
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:37,187
Iraqi and Afghan losing their parents and home...

220
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:40,529
That's really good. Her English is so fluent.

221
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:43,453
Well, she is studying in London after all.

222
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:45,989
Ah... I say...

223
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:53,888
Everyone's so good. I wonder how Tsukushi will fair.

224
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:59,082
Finally, we have Makino Tsukushi-san up on stage...

225
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:16,901
Now, I am living in my father's company's residence
with my family.

226
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:24,917
But, we have to leave it soon for his business reasons.

227
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:29,958
Sis is actually talking about her personal life.

228
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:33,356
Isn't the title "Unfortunate Children"?

229
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:41,623
Even without a house to live in,

230
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:49,750
I love my father, my mother, and my brother.

231
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:56,750
The most important thing for me, is my family.

232
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:58,839
What is she saying?

233
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,461
I don't know.

234
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:04,043
Not bad, Makino.

235
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:12,183
I believe, what is most needed for deprived children,

236
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:17,739
is... a warm family.

237
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:29,417
And next, we will have the Main TOJ Judge announce the two finalists.

238
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,990
The first finalist is the one with international experience and taste,

239
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,922
Kurimaki Ayano-san.

240
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:43,714
Kurimaki-san's perceptiveness is really spectacular.

241
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,083
Next, we have discussed about this for quite some time...

242
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:52,640
I have a suggestion here.

243
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,043
What do you think if we pick the last finalist
by a game of scissors, paper, stone?

244
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:56,841
What on earth?

245
00:18:56,841 --> 00:19:03,625
Let's see which beauty does the Goddess of Luck
have her eyes upon.

246
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,345
Scissors, paper, stone!

247
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:21,137
The result is...

248
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:23,881
Makino Tsukushi-san!

249
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:25,507
Yes!

250
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,729
She did it!

251
00:19:30,806 --> 00:19:32,379
I've won!

252
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:41,155
Hey hey, this isn't fair!

253
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:43,117
That's right! What kind of joke are the judges trying to crack?

254
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:45,237
The others' speech are all better than hers.

255
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:46,485
Yea! That's right!

256
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:51,575
The results of the earlier round were also ridiculous.

257
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:54,845
You guys are just playing with the results!

258
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,774
All of you, shut the hell up!

259
00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:09,535
This is a competition to pick the best girl.

260
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,368
Ordinary people should just shut up.

261
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,002
Domyoji.

262
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,740
Makino! You can do this!

263
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,519
I'll always be here watching you.

264
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:39,031
Where were you?

265
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,426
I was watching from here.

266
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:41,882
Just felt a bit nervous.

267
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:52,682
Next, the two finalists will be battling it out on stage.

268
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:55,786
Tsukasa.

269
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,428
What will you do if Ayano wins instead?

270
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,857
I believe that Makino can do it.

271
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:17,667
Next... The final category is homemaking.

272
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:22,717
I would now like to invite the judges
who are specially for this round up on stage.

273
00:21:26,774 --> 00:21:28,088
What is this?

274
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:40,625
The two finalists must now play with these 21 children
for the next 30 minutes.

275
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:43,655
They may use any of the provided equipment.

276
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:48,750
And finally, these kids will choose the person
whom they think is more fun to play with.

277
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:52,340
Hello, everyone.

278
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,165
Hello.

279
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,501
Yup. Now follow me.

280
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,288
Okay!

281
00:21:58,288 --> 00:21:59,223
Oh no.

282
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:01,249
She took the first opportunity.

283
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:07,083
He-ll-o, everyone!

284
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:08,953
What's that for?

285
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,747
She's just like an fool!

286
00:22:13,204 --> 00:22:15,156
Let's go, everyone.

287
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:17,249
Yes.

288
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:18,469
How outrageous...

289
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:19,890
Looks like she took a big blow.

290
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,446
The kids should know best.

291
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:26,542
Everything that is happening in the room
is being broadcasted on the screen.

292
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,492
What the hell are you doing, Makino?!

293
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:32,885
Don't think so much. Just do what you need to do.

294
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,947
Running with the wind...

295
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:47,338
Dancing in the snow...

296
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:51,837
Smiling at the snow.

297
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:56,208
Oh no... This is really bad.

298
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,690
I heard that you're just a poor commoner.

299
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,263
Hah?

300
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:04,833
What can you do, you bunch of poor people?

301
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,712
Maybe you're just useless.

302
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:09,366
This is just like F4...

303
00:23:09,993 --> 00:23:11,038
How old are you guys?

304
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:12,977
Seven!

305
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:16,306
Well, I'm 17, ya?

306
00:23:16,306 --> 00:23:17,936
Just like an old woman.

307
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:20,917
What's there to be proud of, you poor person?

308
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:22,533
Stupid!

309
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:24,879
You...

310
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,682
I get the feeling that Ayano is controlling this whole thing.

311
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:32,906
You lads haven't earnt a cent for your ownselves.

312
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:35,243
So go to h*ll.

313
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:38,737
I wonder where I've heard that before...

314
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:45,591
Let's go over there to play.

315
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,615
Anyway, you guys don't play anything
other than TV games at home.

316
00:23:51,615 --> 00:23:55,879
What would you guys know how to play anyway?

317
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,306
She's good. Very good.

318
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:08,727
I can do that.

319
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:10,954
Show me then.

320
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,577
You don't even know how to play this properly.

321
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:34,767
Kids will always be kids.

322
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:43,683
Don't tell me she doesn't know that there are cameras in the room.

323
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:44,633
Ya...

324
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,979
Come on! Catch me!

325
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:12,915
Alright...

326
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,314
You old woman, never would have guessed...

327
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:34,537
You lads, you're not bad yourselves...

328
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:36,230
That looks like fun.

329
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,538
Me too!

330
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,940
Wait...

331
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:47,310
Let's play! Let's play!

332
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:53,232
Yea yea I got it.

333
00:25:57,229 --> 00:26:00,077
Tsukushi, what will we play next?

334
00:26:00,322 --> 00:26:03,051
Wait. Hang on a sec...

335
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,211
Come on!

336
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,203
Hey, Ayano-san.

337
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:10,045
Huh?

338
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:13,191
Come and help me will you?

339
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,789
I can't handle all these kids alone.

340
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:17,850
Mm.

341
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,881
The two of them are playing together.

342
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:20,705
1...

343
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,867
2...

344
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,152
3...

345
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:24,296
4...

346
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:28,524
Only you can do that, Makino.

347
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:32,125
Whee... Ah... You tripped... Let's do it again.

348
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:39,958
Ladies and gentlemen, all of the rounds
have finally been completed.

349
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:46,792
Next, we will announce Teen Of Japan 2005's winner!

350
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:57,129
Excuse me, judges...

351
00:26:57,651 --> 00:27:00,716
which sister did you like playing with more?

352
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:06,235
On my count of three, you will run to the side
of the person of your choice.

353
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:10,763
1...

354
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:17,072
2...

355
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,937
3...!

356
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:30,697
Eh? What's wrong with everyone?

357
00:27:30,697 --> 00:27:34,684
Alright, now please run over to
whoever you found the most fun.

358
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:35,631
I like both!

359
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:38,869
So do I... Me too...

360
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:40,911
I can't just choose one.

361
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:44,607
Hey hey... This could be... Perhaps... Maybe...

362
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:46,251
This is a first...

363
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:49,744
Main Judge, what shall we do?

364
00:27:55,767 --> 00:28:03,833
Everyone, we have decided to use the results
of the entire competition to determine the winner.

365
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:05,999
It's quite difficult to tell if you use the overall results...

366
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:08,295
Nah, everything has already been decided.

367
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:11,009
Just who will win?

368
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:14,643
Only God knows...

369
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,856
I apologise for making everyone wait.

370
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:30,279
Announcing tonights lucky winner...

371
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:40,792
The grand winner of Teen Of Japan 2005 is...

372
00:28:46,212 --> 00:28:49,334
Kurimaki Ayano-san.

373
00:28:54,713 --> 00:28:56,102
I lost.

374
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:09,007
Congratulations.

375
00:29:09,007 --> 00:29:10,590
Thank you.

376
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:16,875
Although the grand trophy has been
awarded to Kurimaki Ayano-san,

377
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:21,993
our little judges have decided that there is no one winner.

378
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:32,167
Hence, we will be awarding Makino Tsukushi-san
a special prize sum of 1 million yen.

379
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,820
Eh?

380
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:48,673
You've done well, Makino Tsukushi.

381
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:54,931
We'll always be behind you, Tsukushi-chan.

382
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:57,846
Tsukushi, you're the best!
You've changed my opinion of you.

383
00:30:11,673 --> 00:31:00,592
Tsukushi... Tsukushi... Tsukushi...

384
00:31:00,871 --> 00:31:07,000
Ma'am, Kurimaki Ayano-san has won the competition.

385
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:09,401
That would be obvious.

386
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,118
Makino, you've done very well.

387
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:12,985
You're great, you got second!

388
00:31:12,985 --> 00:31:14,052
Congratulations.

389
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:19,167
But, being second isn't enough to change anything.

390
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,921
Who said so?

391
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:21,305
Eh?

392
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:24,620
What's going to happen later-
think about it later.

393
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,638
Tomorrow will have tomorrow's troubles.

394
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,101
We will always help you anytime you need it.

395
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:33,910
Great!

396
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,916
Let me organise a party today to celebrate
Makino winning second place.

397
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:40,471
Let us, F4, settle this great party.

398
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:43,829
Where's Domyoji?

399
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:47,887
Ah, I saw him over there just now.

400
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:49,272
Tsukushi!

401
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:52,074
You're the best, Tsukushi!

402
00:31:52,074 --> 00:31:53,262
Mama is really touched.

403
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:55,014
Onee-chan, you were very cool.

404
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,923
You were great.

405
00:31:57,294 --> 00:32:00,391
I'm sorry, everyone. I couldn't win this.

406
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:02,032
What are you saying?

407
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:06,184
Tsukushi, you are my greatest daughter.

408
00:32:06,543 --> 00:32:08,568
You're the pride of Papa.

409
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:21,250
Congratulations on winning in the end, Ayano-san.

410
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,133
Thank you.

411
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:27,853
From today onwards, I hope you'll take good care of Tsukasa.

412
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:29,042
Ma'am?

413
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:30,422
Yes?

414
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,871
I think the one taking care of Tsukusa,

415
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,243
should be Makino-san.

416
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:38,600
You're kidding.

417
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,382
Why do you say the same thing as they do?

418
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:44,379
Although in the end I won,

419
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,884
I think Makino-san has moved the hearts of many even more.

420
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:59,375
I now fully understand the real reason
why Tsukasa loves Makino-san.

421
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:07,333
Right now, I don't think I have any right to be Tsukasa's fiance.

422
00:33:31,694 --> 00:33:34,660
Makino! Congratulations to you!

423
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,636
Where's Domyoji?

424
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:55,741
He had something to do.

425
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:57,882
I see.

426
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:13,732
Mom.

427
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:19,726
A deal is a deal.

428
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:27,125
I know.
Seems like we just couldn't make it with our own power.

429
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:31,823
But after seeing Tsukushi's performance,

430
00:34:32,468 --> 00:34:37,125
I've come to realise that one can only
touch others' hearts with one's own.

431
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:51,950
Well then, take care, Mom.

432
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:01,630
We're really very sorry.

433
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:06,789
So it was you guys who cut up my clothes after all.

434
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:11,042
But in the end, you really moved us deeply.

435
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:12,682
Our tears were streaming out.

436
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:16,176
I really felt that we did something wrong.

437
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:27,500
Anyway, it was thanks to you cutting up my clothes
that I was able to attain second place.

438
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,642
That's right!

439
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,995
Well, we feel a lot better now.

440
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:44,636
Hey hey...

441
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:00,966
But you actually helped Tsukushi write her speech.

442
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:03,136
That totally changed my impression of you.

443
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:06,456
Then will you go out with me?

444
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:07,345
No no he can't.

445
00:36:07,345 --> 00:36:09,213
Akira already has the old Lady Boss.

446
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:10,872
Eh?

447
00:36:11,308 --> 00:36:13,453
You two really have a relationship going on?

448
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:16,224
Ah, no it's not true... Just that...

449
00:36:17,115 --> 00:36:19,998
I cannot forget the men I've met before.

450
00:36:19,998 --> 00:36:29,458
But after seeing Tsukushi, I realise that I
should just stick to the one I truly like.

451
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:34,112
At least now you know she's married. You're lucky, Akira.

452
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:36,397
Then, you're single now right?

453
00:36:36,397 --> 00:36:39,410
How bout it?

454
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:43,162
Uhh alright. I'll go out with you tomorrow.

455
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:46,558
Nishikado-san, are you free tomorrow?

456
00:36:46,558 --> 00:36:48,787
I have a tea ceremony to attend. I'm very busy.

457
00:36:48,787 --> 00:36:52,046
Then if you have some spare time, will you let me know?

458
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:54,334
Uh yea. I'll let you know if I have some free time.

459
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:57,388
Really?!

460
00:36:57,388 --> 00:37:00,660
You must definitely let me know when you're free.

461
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:59,285
You're slow, Domyoji.

462
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:19,259
Umm, I...

463
00:38:21,076 --> 00:38:24,431
didn't win.

464
00:38:24,431 --> 00:38:26,673
I was watching.

465
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:30,470
I'm truly sorry.

466
00:38:30,988 --> 00:38:34,465
And you were cheering me on all the way...

467
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:38,708
Yep, I believe that you are a fine woman.

468
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,963
Well then, about tomorrow...

469
00:38:48,246 --> 00:38:50,358
I'd like you to accompany for a while.

470
00:38:51,102 --> 00:38:51,952
Eh?

471
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:59,083
I've already gotten ready 4 million yen. So let me settle it as 
Makino Tsukushi's Christmas gift.

472
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:00,764
What are you saying?

473
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:03,635
And that, 
together with the prize money from winning second place,

474
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,802
adds up to about 5 million.

475
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,615
You can't... That's too much...

476
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:12,333
I've already returned your father his job.

477
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:13,740
You're not kidding?

478
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,530
Really.

479
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:19,303
I'm going to be very busy.

480
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:25,469
I've got a lot of things to do today, so I can't meet you.

481
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:30,075
But then, it's still too much...

482
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:34,292
So I say, go out with me tomorrow, alright?

483
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:36,222
Mm.

484
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:40,763
But, are you sure that much is fine?

485
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:42,651
It's fine!

486
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:48,333
Meet me at the food centre at 2 o'clock tomorrow.

487
00:39:50,968 --> 00:39:52,343
Got it.

488
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:55,813
See you then.

489
00:39:58,526 --> 00:39:59,781
See you.

490
00:40:02,398 --> 00:40:03,775
Makino?

491
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,934
Hmm?

492
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:09,658
If today's competition was held again,

493
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:12,520
you'll definitely be first.

494
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:15,890
Thanks.

495
00:40:35,085 --> 00:40:36,484
Tsukushi.

496
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:41,583
Just now, Lady Boss called and said that they've return
everything they took from the Confectionary shop.

497
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:42,667
No kidding.

498
00:40:42,668 --> 00:40:43,667
It's true.

499
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:49,150
That's great!

500
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,333
Great! Let's toast to her achievement!

501
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:57,318
Cheers...

502
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:00,098
Cheers!

503
00:41:00,098 --> 00:41:04,551
Live long! Live long!

504
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:06,064
Live Long!

505
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,849
I was suddenly called back by my manager.

506
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:09,902
Eh?

507
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:14,961
You should have come to see me
personally about your job position.

508
00:41:15,766 --> 00:41:18,587
I've prepared a position for you as Section Manager.

509
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:21,645
You're being promoted 2 levels,

510
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,531
so come back and work here.

511
00:41:26,629 --> 00:41:28,231
You're the best Papa.

512
00:41:28,231 --> 00:41:31,114
The company really needs Papa after all.

513
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:34,476
Today I specially made roasted chicken skin.

514
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:38,710
Tsukushi got second place!

515
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,940
Let's celebrate!

516
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,448
Thank you for the food!

517
00:41:41,448 --> 00:41:43,533
Thank you for the food!

518
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:54,558
Tsukasa.

519
00:41:54,558 --> 00:41:55,743
Oh, Rui.

520
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:59,781
I was planning on meeting you when
I finished packing my stuff.

521
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,206
Why didn't you attend the party?

522
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,166
I had a lot of things to settle.

523
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,538
I see.

524
00:42:09,538 --> 00:42:15,042
Hey Rui, can I trust you to do something important?

525
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:16,242
Hmm?

526
00:42:17,509 --> 00:42:24,250
I'm asking you to do this,
because I believe you are a true man.

527
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:26,071
What is it? Why?

528
00:42:26,071 --> 00:42:27,867
Well sit first Rui.

529
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,973
You want an apple?

530
00:42:29,973 --> 00:42:31,033
Here...

531
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:37,583
Have you suddenly decided to give up on Makino?

532
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,979
Why should I give her up?

533
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:42,741
Then what is it?

534
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:44,534
Let me make this clear,

535
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:48,595
I'm not planning on letting you have Makino at all.

536
00:42:48,595 --> 00:42:53,269
Well, if Makino decides that she loves you instead,

537
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:54,945
what would I do?

538
00:42:56,538 --> 00:42:59,759
Then, what is it you wanted me to do?

539
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:20,231
Huh?

540
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:22,166
I see.

541
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,668
Are you sure, Tsukasa?

542
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:29,835
Yea, I'm sure.

543
00:43:57,745 --> 00:43:59,253
Alright.

544
00:44:00,535 --> 00:44:02,182
Makino.

545
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:06,861
Hanazawa Rui.

546
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:12,009
This is from Tsukasa.

547
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:20,042
That fella said he's going to New York.

548
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,604
Eh?

549
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:23,484
Are you kidding?

550
00:44:23,484 --> 00:44:25,299
I'm not kidding.

551
00:44:27,604 --> 00:44:29,257
Why is he going?

552
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:35,292
Tsukasa and his mom made an agreement.

553
00:44:35,296 --> 00:44:37,226
An agreement?

554
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:45,000
If that girl doesn't win the competition, you will have to
come to New York to study Management Economics.

555
00:44:44,995 --> 00:44:46,690
Management Economics?

556
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,333
It lasts for 3 years.

557
00:44:50,494 --> 00:44:57,125
Even if Makino Tsukushi doesn't win,
but you agree to this condition,

558
00:44:57,105 --> 00:45:01,875
I will restore back to Makino her family status,
as well as the Confectionary Shop.

559
00:45:03,943 --> 00:45:12,250
This way, even if she doesn't win,
there is still a chance to help her.

560
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:21,667
I think he firmly believed that you would win,
so he agreed to the conditions.

561
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:27,344
He'll be waiting for you at
the hangar for his private jet this evening.

562
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:42,726
I'm so stupid.

563
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:50,034
I didn't know a thing myself, and yet I've been celebrating.

564
00:45:51,775 --> 00:45:56,047
Can you accompany me for the rest of the day?

565
00:45:56,535 --> 00:46:01,292
The last time, I went out with you when
you were feeling down.

566
00:46:02,972 --> 00:46:07,250
So, can you go out with me today?

567
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:11,180
Is that fine with you?

568
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:20,917
He just ran off like that.
There's nothing much I can do.

569
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:26,021
Aren't you going to go after him?

570
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,898
If you truly love him, you'd go
after him no matter where he went.

571
00:46:31,898 --> 00:46:38,750
Will you be satisfied with just
standing to one side and watching him leave?

572
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,091
That...

573
00:46:43,594 --> 00:46:49,125
Don't you remember? Somene said this to me...

574
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:57,861
In the end, you must always show your true feelings.

575
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,061
This car is from my home. Just tell the driver
where you want to go, and he'll take you there.

576
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:07,554
Quickly go after him.

577
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:16,782
Good luck!

578
00:47:44,186 --> 00:47:45,782
Long time no see.

579
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:48,225
Why?

580
00:47:48,225 --> 00:47:50,045
Where's your fiance?

581
00:47:50,045 --> 00:47:55,083
I wanted to spend this Christmas
with the one I truly love.

582
00:48:07,904 --> 00:48:13,686
Why does everyone tell me to say my true feelings?

583
00:48:15,628 --> 00:48:17,630
To Makino.

584
00:48:18,348 --> 00:48:20,094
How are you?

585
00:48:20,094 --> 00:48:22,555
I'm doing fine.

586
00:48:22,956 --> 00:48:28,958
My going to New York is a bit sudden,
but I'm going there to study Management Economics.

587
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:34,375
I'm that heir to the world famous Domyoji family,
that's why I don't have a choice.

588
00:48:34,374 --> 00:48:40,000
Initially, I thought that you were just a wild girl.

589
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:42,669
But then, unknowingly, I started to like you.

590
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,968
Don't be so full of yourself.

591
00:48:44,968 --> 00:48:49,708
Or maybe the first time I met you,
I had already taken a liking of you,

592
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,932
although I gave you the Red Paper, and bullied you a lot.

593
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:54,659
1 hundred million yen.
That's how much what you're wearing costs.

594
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:55,698
1 hundred million?!

595
00:48:55,698 --> 00:48:58,857
You caringly took care of me in the elevator.

596
00:48:58,857 --> 00:49:00,627
Poor commoners like me are used to the cold.

597
00:49:00,627 --> 00:49:02,098
That's when I realised that you were
a gentle, warm-hearted girl.

598
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:05,266
That's because, I, Tsukushi, am a weed.
(Tsukushi is a type of plant, horsetail)

599
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:09,574
When I was getting beat up by Sanjyo Sakurako's men,

600
00:49:09,574 --> 00:49:12,840
it was the first time I was beat up so badly.

601
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:19,625
It's because of you, that I found out
how much it hurts to get beaten up.

602
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:21,268
I love you.

603
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:29,125
When Rui returned, I thought you liked Rui instead.

604
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,478
That's why I thought both of you had a relationship going.

605
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:34,528
- Here
I believe in you.

606
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:38,917
I also believe that my friends like you a lot.

607
00:49:38,936 --> 00:49:42,379
You don't know how to do anything,
and you're poor too.

608
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:44,539
No one was able to teach you anything.

609
00:49:45,364 --> 00:49:50,521
And I didn't expect that winning TOJ
would become my responsibility.

610
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:54,125
But, you're the best.

611
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:56,698
You can't expect less from my girl.

612
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:03,833
It was a pity that I wasn't able to show you the actual Saturn.

613
00:50:03,822 --> 00:50:08,021
If you and I went to the stars, we'd be aliens from Saturn.

614
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:14,959
Perhaps the happy times, and sad times,
are all decided by fate.

615
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:21,785
That's that's why I've decided to send you Saturn as a gift.

616
00:50:23,484 --> 00:50:28,667
Let's go to the stars, Saturnian.

617
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:32,058
This is the first time I'm giving a gift to a girl,

618
00:50:32,058 --> 00:50:34,248
so if you lose it, I'll kill you.

619
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:37,151
<Domyoji Private Airport>

620
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:44,292
I always feel happy whenever I'm with you.

621
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:47,944
Hey! Hey! Stop!

622
00:50:48,988 --> 00:50:55,083
That is why I might just come back
because I wanted to see you.

623
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:57,125
But what's decided is final,

624
00:50:57,125 --> 00:51:00,126
so there's no turning back.
- Wait.

625
00:51:00,126 --> 00:51:01,501
Ya ya ya hurry!

626
00:51:01,501 --> 00:51:03,277
Tsukasa's leaving..

627
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:04,941
You take care.

628
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:06,991
I'll take care too.

629
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:09,747
Until next time...

630
00:51:10,781 --> 00:51:13,120
From Domyoji Tsukasa.

631
00:51:38,707 --> 00:51:40,845
Domyoji!

632
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:48,783
Domyoji.

633
00:51:50,578 --> 00:51:53,454
Domyoji!

634
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:57,955
Domyoji!

635
00:51:57,955 --> 00:51:59,383
Makino.

636
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:04,788
Domyoji!

637
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,489
I'm sorry.

638
00:52:31,076 --> 00:52:33,184
Nishida,
- Yes?

639
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:36,856
I think I left my sunglasses in the house.

640
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:38,794
I will go look for it.

641
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:40,650
Excuse me.

642
00:52:51,478 --> 00:52:52,816
What are you doing, stupid?

643
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:54,790
Running in this place, it's dangerous.

644
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:59,292
You are the stupid one!
Why didn't you discuss this with me?

645
00:53:00,362 --> 00:53:04,822
You just go anywhere you like. You're so selfish!

646
00:53:09,077 --> 00:53:10,735
My apologies.

647
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:20,810
That skirt looks good on you.

648
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:29,274
I have...

649
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:35,334
something important to say, which I have yet to tell you.

650
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,571
Something important?

651
00:53:42,446 --> 00:53:44,414
Thank you.

652
00:53:48,102 --> 00:53:59,083
Always... Always believing in me, encouraging me...

653
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:03,667
Thank you... very much.

654
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:19,583
And for this as well, thanks.

655
00:54:37,187 --> 00:54:41,085
I will become a better man when I return.

656
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:50,417
I must ask this of you, that you "power up",
so that you and I will complement each other.

657
00:54:55,739 --> 00:55:03,375
But for now, and later, and what comes after that...

658
00:55:04,251 --> 00:55:08,990
you will be the only girl that I love.

659
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:15,411
I will be with you foreever.

660
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,452
Aren't you happy?

661
00:55:30,644 --> 00:55:33,886
No way...

662
00:55:37,368 --> 00:55:43,625
You're lying, you already love me.

663
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:50,262
Yup I do.

664
00:55:52,626 --> 00:55:58,083
I love a stupid, stubborn, Domyoji in my heart.
