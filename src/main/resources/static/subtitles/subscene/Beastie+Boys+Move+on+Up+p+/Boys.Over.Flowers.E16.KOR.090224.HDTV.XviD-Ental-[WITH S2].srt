3
00:00:19,578 --> 00:00:22,206
I came here only because
your house was the closest.

4
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:26,267
Because of the fight we had in Macau,
Yi Jung would have something to say.

5
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,048
And at Woo Bin's place, the women are too noisy.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,731
What about me getting punched?

7
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:33,681
What are you gonna do about that?

8
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,435
Uh... fine.  Hit me!

9
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:40,737
If I take one, then we'll be even.

10
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:43,080
Hurry up and just punch me.

11
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:47,207
What's with the engagement?

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,768
Ah, who knows.

13
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:52,526
How could I possibly know everything
that the evil witch schemes up?

14
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:55,341
Engagement?  Whatever.

15
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:58,843
Where did she get a girl like that?

16
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,871
Did everybody... get home safely?

17
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:07,799
If you're curious about Jan Di,

18
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,956
she got home safely.

19
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:11,510
Who said I was curious?

20
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:17,311
But you!

21
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,863
It's your friend's birthday so
why don't you give him a present?

22
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:22,342
Quickly give it to me, the present.

23
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:29,457
What is it?

24
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:55,435
<i>Gu Jun Pyo,</i>

25
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:57,372
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

26
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,902
<i>I'll pray that this birthday isn't lonely,</i>

27
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:04,777
<i>and is a day filled with happy things.</i>

28
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:06,893
<i>Geum Jan Di.</i>

29
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:40,653
<i>What I said to Jun Pyo in Macau...</i>

30
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:42,269
I know...

31
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:47,552
You only said that because
you were mad at Gu Jun Pyo.

32
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,371
Hey you...

33
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,998
Hey you... hey, Beef Jerky!

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,077
It's you, isn't it? It's you, Macau's
Miss Beef Jerky?

35
00:03:43,582 --> 00:03:45,122
Uh... hello.

36
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:46,962
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,402
What's this? I'm the one who saved
your life,

38
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,492
but you don't look happy to see me.

39
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,157
When I'm really happy to see you.

40
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,060
I am happy.

41
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:59,524
But... why did you come here?

42
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,381
I just came to find someone.

43
00:04:04,893 --> 00:04:06,541
Gu Jun Pyo?

44
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,613
Oh? How did you know?

45
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,250
Do you know that rascal?

46
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,063
Oh, right. Your name is...

47
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:19,129
Jan Di. Geum Jan Di.

48
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,954
Ah, Geum Jan Di.

49
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:23,598
Do you remember my name?

50
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,295
Ha... Jae... Kyung.

51
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:30,580
Seeing that you're wearing a uniform,
you must still be in high school?

52
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,610
Junior? Senior?

53
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:33,783
Senior.

54
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,263
I'm also planning on attending
Shinhwa University.

55
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:37,130
Worked out well.

56
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,366
Do you want to become sisters?

57
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:39,984
Huh?

58
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:43,484
Oooh, so cute!

59
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:44,685
Ever since I first saw you,

60
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:47,140
I thought that you were cute as a mouse,
so I liked you, little sister Jan Di.

61
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:51,610
Little... sister Jan Di?

62
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,208
But where is that rascal hiding?

63
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,130
Oh!

64
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,369
Why is that woman here?

65
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:03,536
Oh, found him!

66
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,015
What?

67
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:12,794
What do you mean "what"?!
Your fiancée, of course!

68
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,255
Hey! Hey! Let go!

69
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:17,411
What?

70
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,045
You don't like my greeting?

71
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,739
Then should I bite your ear like
last time?

72
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,817
You're like a crazy monkey.
What are you doing?

73
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:31,433
You're not going to buzz off?

74
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,013
I'm only going to say this once,
so listen closely.

75
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:36,223
My name is Ha Jae Kyung.

76
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:38,941
From this day forward, I'm your fiancée.

77
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,098
You got it?

78
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,221
Also, it's over.

79
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:43,264
What's over?

80
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:47,000
From now on, I'm gonna tame you.

81
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,188
Bang!

82
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,994
Jun Pyo... starting today, he'll be
attending Shinhwa University with us.

83
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,670
Then you are ok with it?

84
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,755
About what?

85
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,161
That woman!

86
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:23,780
The woman called his fiancée

87
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:26,952
is clinging onto Gu Jun Pyo like that.
And you don't care?

88
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:29,921
What does that have to do with me?

89
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:32,484
And besides... that unni.

90
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:33,880
Unni?

91
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:38,441
She seems like a cool person.

92
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:42,505
No. She is a really cool person.

93
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:43,329
Who?

94
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,045
Who's a cool person?

95
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:49,857
How... how did you get here?

96
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,297
Hi!

97
00:06:51,298 --> 00:06:52,734
I'm Ha Jae Kyung.

98
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,545
Are you Jan Di's friend?

99
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,156
I'm Jan Di's friend too!

100
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:57,661
Nice to meet you.

101
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:58,579
Eh?

102
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:02,358
So this is where you work?
Seems like fun!

103
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,046
I too wanted to do something like this.

104
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,175
Then please do it!

105
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,365
A gorgeous beauty like you

106
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,957
is welcome anytime!

107
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:15,750
For now, I'll borrow these friends
for today.

108
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:17,016
What?

109
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:21,850
Chen, don't think about following me
and take care of this place for me.

110
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:23,567
Jan Di. Ga Eul.

111
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,631
You're gonna leave me here and
go somewhere again, aren't you?

112
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,224
Don't worry about the
porridge shop and go ahead.

113
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,203
<i>Pretty, no?</i>

114
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:21,884
You know what? I really
wanted to do something like this.

115
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:24,565
Chat with my girls, say bad things
about our boyfriends.

116
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:27,054
And talk about dating and relationships.

117
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:31,807
Do you… not have any friends?

118
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:34,977
Oh, no. I don't have any friends.

119
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,597
Eat!

120
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:17,557
Ever since I was young,
India, Europe, Africa...

121
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,869
We went to so many places.

122
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,600
I didn't have any time to make friends.

123
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:28,471
Uh...

124
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:31,244
What type of girl does Jun Pyo like?

125
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:56,580
This is pretty.

126
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,406
Bags! There, there!
Let's go over there.

127
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,383
Pretty, huh?

128
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:08,255
Mmhmm.

129
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:10,625
That one is cute too.

130
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,471
Jan Di.

131
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,441
A feminine style?

132
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:16,657
If not, a boyish style?

133
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,882
Or would he like a cute style?

134
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,588
That guy...

135
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:24,879
From head to toe,

136
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:27,234
he's only concerned with his own
appearance.

137
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:30,144
He probably wouldn't remember
what style a girl dresses in.

138
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,668
I'm liking that rascal more and more.

139
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:35,994
I like a man who is abrupt and blunt.

140
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,525
Tell me more about him,
little sister Jan Di.

141
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:49,401
Haughty and self-centered, he'd be
disappointed

142
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:52,368
to take second place to anyone else's
arrogance and pompousness.

143
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:55,476
He acts like he knows everything,

144
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:57,335
but actually, he's really naive.

145
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:00,711
Also...

146
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:04,891
If he likes something,

147
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:10,175
then he'll ignore others' opinions,
and stubbornly go after it.

148
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,294
Like a bulldozer.

149
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,123
When he's angry, he's incredibly scary.

150
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:24,046
But when he's good to you,

151
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,045
he's affectionate.

152
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:39,275
Uh… anyway,

153
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:43,297
what I'm saying is.. he's an immature,
elementary school, overbearing big devil!

154
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:45,069
Just think of him like that.

155
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,567
Jan Di, you know Gu Jun Pyo well.

156
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,285
That's great!

157
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:52,317
Then I'll officially ask you.

158
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:53,536
Uh... what?

159
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:56,128
I really want to get along with
that rascal.

160
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,287
Jan Di, from today on,

161
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:01,379
be my dating coach.

162
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:04,924
As a favor. Hmm?

163
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,771
That girl's character has quite the
impact, don't you think?

164
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:28,487
No doubt about it.

165
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:31,301
Think that she's Geum Jan Di's strongest...

166
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,757
What's so amusing that you guys are
cracking up?

167
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:36,506
We're talking about your fiancée.

168
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,202
She's interesting.

169
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:39,710
Fiancée? Whose fiancée?

170
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,618
Why? I like her.

171
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:45,958
For a tycoon's daughter, she's not boring.
Isn't that a good thing?

172
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:49,297
But when you guys get so close?

173
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:51,850
Before, didn't she clearly say
something about biting your ear?

174
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,132
Jun Pyo...

175
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:55,237
Isn't that your weak point?

176
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:59,120
To be more accurate,
it would be his sensitive point.

177
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,695
Hey, you guys think that this is
entertaining?

178
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,063
Is it funny?

179
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:06,655
Supposed to be my friends... seriously!

180
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,347
Hey, move!

181
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:21,173
Really, what should we do?

182
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:23,819
No matter how you look at it,
Jun Pyo seems to be caught.

183
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,421
Even if you take away the fact
that it's an arranged engagement,

184
00:13:27,422 --> 00:13:29,484
what if she has real feelings for him?

185
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:31,288
And don't forget, it's the JK Group.

186
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,149
If we don't think of something fast,

187
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,861
then it's only a matter of time before
Jun Pyo enters the wedding hall.

188
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:37,323
You guys can just get involved.

189
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,412
- What?
- What?

190
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:44,359
F4's Don Juan and Casanova.

191
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,860
Try putting some of your skills into
action.

192
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,364
Um... we can go by ourselves now.

193
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:06,031
Today was fun.

194
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,516
And also...

195
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:10,345
From now on, you two are Ha Jae Kyung's
"BF" (best friends), okay?

196
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,599
- What?
- What?

197
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:13,398
And also... this.

198
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:16,174
This is Jan Di's.

199
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:18,874
This is Ga Eul's.

200
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:21,109
What is this?

201
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,859
Bribes to thank you for being my friend.

202
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,174
Good night!

203
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,954
She...

204
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:38,341
Seems a little strange, that unni.

205
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,830
Yeah, a little.

206
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:45,859
Still, her character is hard to dislike.

207
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:00,765
Ahhh... it's cold.

208
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,411
You're back?

209
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:09,515
What's... wrong with everyone?

210
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:11,299
Did something happen?

211
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,876
Young Master Jun Pyo's engagement…
is it true?

212
00:15:15,258 --> 00:15:17,662
How did you find out about that?

213
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:26,225
[Shinhwa Group Becomes In-Laws with
Global Investment Group JK]

214
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,006
It's true.

215
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,454
What do we about this?

216
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:42,038
During this time, we thought
no news was good news and waited.

217
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:45,237
What will happen to our Jan Di now?

218
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:48,141
What do you mean, what will happen?

219
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:50,609
What do he and I have to do with
each other?

220
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,735
What?

221
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:53,976
Are we in mourning?

222
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,610
What do you mean,
nothing to do with each other?

223
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:58,235
Until last year, the position of Shinhwa
Group's daughter-in-law belonged to you.

224
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:00,610
How can it have nothing to do with you?

225
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,174
Wait a minute. Now we're ruined.

226
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:08,069
Where exactly did this girl roll in...?

227
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:12,484
They say that the rock that rolls
displaces the rock in place...

228
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:15,633
Wait a minute. You have to find out
exactly what kind of girl she is,

229
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:17,195
First figure out her name.

230
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:39,675
Hello!

231
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:41,891
Hi!

232
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,724
There's all sorts of stuff in here.

233
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,797
This is really...

234
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:54,141
My name is Ha Jae Kyung.

235
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:56,173
Jan Di and I decided to be BF...

236
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:58,516
No... from now on we're sisters.

237
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,225
Please take care of me.

238
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:02,258
Ha Jae Kyung.

239
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,828
Oh my, even the name is quite pretty.

240
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,515
Your face is pretty too.

241
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:10,140
And now that you've become sisters
with our Jan Di,

242
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:11,890
That means you're part of our family too!

243
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,299
Isn't that right, honey?

244
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,580
From now on, just think of this as your
home too. Come visit often.

245
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:17,674
Thank you!

246
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,641
Then... can I sleep over tonight?

247
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:30,110
Eh?

248
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:41,724
It's strange. Don't you get a feeling
of déjà vu?

249
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:45,695
Yeah... Dad's been thinking about
that too.

250
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,132
Jan Di. Where's your room?

251
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:54,734
It's just like a pajama party!

252
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:57,788
I always wanted to have one.

253
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,738
This room is really cozy.

254
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,185
Really?

255
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:06,688
It's really miraculous.

256
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:08,424
What?

257
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:12,520
In Macau, when I ran into Gu Jun Pyo
and you,

258
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:14,460
I feel like it was destined.

259
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:19,118
So you've known Gu Jun Pyo since Macau?

260
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:24,804
I... probably fell for him when I first
saw him.

261
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:27,922
Engagement, they say!

262
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,922
Any other time, I would've hit the
road running.

263
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:33,225
But while looking at that guy's face,

264
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:35,539
my heart began to sting.

265
00:18:37,154 --> 00:18:38,675
<i>Jan Di, do you know that feeling?</i>

266
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:44,734
No, wait. Do you like someone?
Like... a first love.

267
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,015
So you do!

268
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
What's he like?

269
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:07,580
Just... kind of a blank person.

270
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:09,140
A blank person?

271
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:19,140
When I looked at him, I would go blank.

272
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,285
He was that kind of person.

273
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:22,562
Ahh... I got it.

274
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:25,300
He's someone who makes people feel
comfortable and warm?

275
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:31,125
Gu Jun Pyo is just like wine.

276
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:32,100
Wine?

277
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,151
Red and aromatic.

278
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:37,922
Once you drink it, all your blood
just boils,

279
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:39,870
that kind of numb feeling.

280
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:47,613
Wait. That rascal doesn't like anyone,
does he?

281
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:50,642
Well, it doesn't matter.

282
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:53,180
From now on, I'll just make him fall
for me.

283
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,674
It's been a really long time,

284
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:02,430
s ince I've wanted to make
something mine, no matter what.

285
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:48,981
What?!

286
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:50,700
Do you have something to say?

287
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:52,820
Why aren't you swimming?

288
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,641
I gave it up.

289
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:56,650
Why would a swimmer give up swimming?

290
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,079
None of your business.

291
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,660
This is what you followed me to say?

292
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:03,486
I can't tolerate being unfairly wronged.

293
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:05,274
So I have to clear up what needs
to be cleared up.

294
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:06,717
What?

295
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,710
The engagement or whatever…
none of it has anything to do with me.

296
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,340
It has nothing to do with me either.

297
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:18,287
Gu Jun Pyo, you've become a lot friendlier.

298
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,290
Explaining something like that
to the stain that you want to erase.

299
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:35,230
Over there. Your fiancée's coming.

300
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:43,620
Why is that monkey here again?

301
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,070
Sunbae!

302
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:03,600
Can you give me a ride?

303
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,359
Seeing the two of you together, it was
almost like it was planned!

304
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Jan Di and Jun Pyo, you two are
really close, huh?

305
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:23,635
Oh... this person...

306
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:26,081
This is Ji Hoo sunbae.

307
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,190
Why are you introducing my friend?

308
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:33,122
Hey, monkey. This is my friend
Yoon Ji Hoo.

309
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:39,000
You like him?

310
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:42,120
At least you can spot the good
looking ones.

311
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:44,670
I understand.

312
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:47,210
What?

313
00:22:48,142 --> 00:22:49,299
It's this person, right?

314
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:51,829
Uh... what?

315
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,200
Jan Di, the person that you like!

316
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,735
Oh, Unni, it's not like that... we're...

317
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:04,316
That's wonderful. The four of us,
let's go hang out.

318
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,339
How about that? Good, right?

319
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,286
- No.
- No, it's fine!

320
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,414
But... why not?

321
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:14,766
I have to quickly go somewhere.

322
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:18,874
Unni, you two go have fun.

323
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,547
Sunbae, quickly, let's go.

324
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:39,990
Now what should we do?

325
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,506
Do what?

326
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:48,007
Let's go together!

327
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:10,745
Now, you work here too?

328
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:13,825
It's not work. It's volunteering.

329
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,455
I just... clean and run errands.

330
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:21,420
I feel comfortable here, and I can
concentrate more on my studies.

331
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:23,713
How mysterious.

332
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:25,340
What is?

333
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:27,660
How can you work so hard at everything
you do?

334
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:34,045
I'll go in now. Go safely.

335
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:39,882
Geum Jan Di.

336
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:42,882
I'm really good at cleaning too.

337
00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:48,802
Oh, hello!

338
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:50,396
Hello!

339
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,320
- Why is the beauty coming now?
- I just got out of school!

340
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,290
- Hello!
- Hi!

341
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,808
<i>Just a second, please.</i>

342
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,115
Hello!

343
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,865
Ah, yes. On Sunday, come here to eat.
Understand?

344
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:08,519
Yes, be careful on the roads.

345
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,219
Ji Hoo! Ji Hoo!

346
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:43,220
What?! That scheming...

347
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:45,813
No… that Doctor Grandpa's grandson..

348
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:47,709
Is Ji Hoo sunbae?

349
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:49,273
But if...

350
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:53,237
Ji Hoo sunbae is President
Yoon Seok Young's grandson... then...

351
00:25:53,274 --> 00:25:57,314
That grandpa is President Yoon Seok Young?!

352
00:25:57,315 --> 00:25:58,584
That makes no sense!

353
00:25:58,585 --> 00:26:00,928
Then how come the two of them
haven't been in touch?

354
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:04,094
It's not that they weren't in touch.
It's that they couldn't get in touch.

355
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,280
What do you mean by that?

356
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:07,720
And what's your relationship with
that grandpa?

357
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:11,989
Jan Di, those two. Please help them.

358
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,365
What?

359
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,001
Oh, welcome!

360
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:17,539
Hi!

361
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,235
Ga Eul. Get me some water.

362
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:22,480
Me too.

363
00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:26,840
What's with everyone?

364
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:10,698
This is a piece that Queen Elizabeth liked.

365
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,200
Do you like it?

366
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:23,215
Whoa, are you giving this to me?

367
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:29,150
Men or dishes, both are waiting for
the woman who will properly appreciate them.

368
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:34,468
Thank you! If I use this as our Leon's
dish, he'll definitely be really happy!

369
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,194
Leon?

370
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:39,250
It's the name of my pet lion!

371
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:43,065
Lion?

372
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,835
Hey, lady.

373
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:02,740
You have killer style.
Why don't we go have some tea?

374
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,350
It's kind of cold.

375
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:09,949
Are you laughing?

376
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,795
It looks like this lady isn't afraid.

377
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:13,586
Guys.

378
00:28:16,315 --> 00:28:18,340
Why don't you let go?

379
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,740
And who are you?

380
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:24,910
You shouldn't bother pretty young ladies.

381
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,314
Stop messing around and buzz off.

382
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:31,081
We saw her first.

383
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,510
Right now, it's time for the little kids
to go home.

384
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:34,831
Go on home.

385
00:28:35,532 --> 00:28:37,095
You'll get hurt.

386
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,193
It might get kind of noisy. My apologies.

387
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,300
Ow, ow! What are you doing?

388
00:29:28,898 --> 00:29:30,599
Miss, are you okay?

389
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:34,063
Thank you for helping me.

390
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:39,227
These idiots.

391
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:45,825
That's not even the worst of it.

392
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,925
Is there more?

393
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:48,781
Don't bring it up.

394
00:29:48,782 --> 00:29:50,950
That woman... is definitely a monster.

395
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,033
I've known plenty of women.

396
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:17,266
But this is the first time I've met
someone like her.

397
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,565
So what do we do now?

398
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,900
That unni... we can't do anything
about her.

399
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,587
We have no other choice,
except for the last emergency method.

400
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:27,228
Emergency method?

401
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:32,641
Forget about Miss Monkey and get the
two idiots together.

402
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,450
The two idiots?

403
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:38,765
So...

404
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:43,610
Ga Eul.

405
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,165
You need to help us a little.

406
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:34,085
I'm the one who killed them.

407
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,390
The one who made that child an orphan…

408
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:45,300
It's all my fault.

409
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,756
Yes, hello?

410
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:19,100
What?! Yi Jung sunbae and you are
doing what?

411
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,150
Date.

412
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:24,970
No! No, you can't, Ga Eul.

413
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:28,245
Why? Yi Jung sunbae isn't a
bad person.

414
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:35,515
Uh, that is… he's not a bad person.

415
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,139
He's not a bad person, but...

416
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,105
that person is F4's best…

417
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:42,422
Best?

418
00:33:42,726 --> 00:33:45,079
Anyway, Ga Eul.

419
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,840
Ga Eul, I think it would be a good idea
if you think this over.

420
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:52,880
I don't know. He said he was going to
pick me up early tomorrow morning.

421
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:57,500
That's why I'm going to sleep early.
Although, I doubt I'll be able to sleep.

422
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,078
Good night, Jan Di. Bye.

423
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:04,040
Uh… Ga Eul…

424
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:14,603
So Yi Jung?

425
00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:17,290
So Yi Jung?

426
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:20,074
So Yi Jung?!

427
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:42,415
Ji Hoo sunbae, pick up your phone.
Please!

428
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,936
<i>The number you've dialled is unavailable.</i>

429
00:35:01,176 --> 00:35:02,618
Ga Eul

430
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,791
Hi.

431
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:09,289
No… No… Absolutely not!

432
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,890
Yo. Geum Jan Di, what's up?

433
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:20,510
Sunbae, Gu Jun Pyo. Where is Gu Jun Pyo?

434
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:29,478
Gu Jun Pyo!

435
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,062
Hey!

436
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,011
Oh, Sunbae!

437
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:42,189
You asked where he was. You didn't ask
what he was doing.

438
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:45,909
What the hell are you doing?

439
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:51,699
Gu Jun Pyo.

440
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:54,072
Help me.

441
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:54,506
There's big trouble!

442
00:35:54,507 --> 00:35:55,759
Big trouble?

443
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,968
It's impossible on my own.

444
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,072
I don't have any money or a car.

445
00:36:00,404 --> 00:36:02,406
And if something happens, you might have
to use your body.

446
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:03,868
Body? Use my body to do what?

447
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:09,564
What if they end up at a hotel?
What are we gonna do?

448
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:10,815
Hotel?

449
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:16,448
Geum Jan Di, I know you must be shocked
because of that monkey,

450
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,135
but why are you not acting like yourself?

451
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:21,010
It's because Yi Jung sunbae is going
on a date with Ga Eul.

452
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:29,544
Now that you mention it… Yi Jung did say
there was a girl he was stuck on.

453
00:36:30,545 --> 00:36:32,451
I wonder how long Ga Eul will take…

454
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:38,342
Two days? No, he could probably
finish her off in a day.

455
00:36:39,043 --> 00:36:39,830
One day?

456
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:44,505
Geum Jan Di, you didn't know that Yi Jung's
nickname is “5 seconds kill,” right?

457
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:46,572
“5 seconds kill”?

458
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:50,250
One.

459
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:53,634
Two.

460
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:56,134
Three.

461
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:59,697
Four.

462
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:05,479
Five.

463
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:30,259
Ga Eul…

464
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:43,604
NO…

465
00:37:44,824 --> 00:37:46,313
NO!!!

466
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:49,354
Is Yi Jung on drugs?

467
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:50,478
To date Ga Eul…

468
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:53,146
What's that supposed to mean?

469
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:56,835
To be honest, Ga Eul is definitely not
Yi Jung's type.

470
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,542
Yi Jung won't date anyone,

471
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:03,590
unless she has a body like Lee Hyori
and a face like Lee Tae Hee.

472
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:05,320
But with Ga Eul?

473
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:08,507
Isolate them in a room for 3 nights
and 4 days,

474
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:10,179
and see if anything happens.

475
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,497
No, he actually said

476
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:16,257
that there's something really cute
about Ga Eul.

477
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:20,194
See! Now what do we do?

478
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:21,686
What are we going to do?

479
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:23,479
So what do you want me to do?

480
00:38:24,853 --> 00:38:26,029
Come here.

481
00:38:27,602 --> 00:38:28,559
Come closer.

482
00:38:33,717 --> 00:38:34,695
I don't know.

483
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:36,069
Why not?

484
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,491
Oh. He's here. He's here.

485
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:08,416
Are you ready?

486
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:10,666
Yes.

487
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:16,205
You and I both made the wrong friends and
are paying for it.

488
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,926
Do you think we can pull this off without
getting caught?

489
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:24,192
Don't worry about that. Just follow
my lead.

490
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:27,979
We've already acted together before.

491
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:42,882
Hey! Sit.

492
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,226
Don't be nervous.

493
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:56,570
Hey, start the car. Hurry, hurry.
Start, start!

494
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:57,632
Ah, really.

495
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:01,882
Okay.

496
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:03,153
I'm going.

497
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,594
Grandfather probably still hates
me, right?

498
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:53,570
All of the people I like didn't
stay by my side.

499
00:41:56,008 --> 00:42:00,995
I was going to start living my life
thinking I didn't need anyone,

500
00:42:05,117 --> 00:42:06,811
but I keep getting greedy.

501
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:09,815
What should I do?

502
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:31,937
Are you okay?

503
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:30,680
It was tiring, right?

504
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:32,601
No, it was fun.

505
00:43:45,634 --> 00:43:50,675
<i>Oh, oh! Who wouldn't say he's a player.</i>

506
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:52,994
Yi Jung sunbae...

507
00:43:52,995 --> 00:43:54,491
is totally full of himself.

508
00:43:56,883 --> 00:44:00,791
Then you'd rather he doesn't pay attention
to whether Ga Eul freezes to death or not?

509
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:04,765
No, that's not it.

510
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,137
Just look at how blue those lips are.

511
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,498
You'll freeze to death first trying to
save your friend.

512
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:16,956
Come here.

513
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,007
- Hey, Hey. What are you…
- Stay still.

514
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:40,916
I'm fine.

515
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,691
See, I told you it'd be effective.

516
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:55,707
Really.

517
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:59,932
Then, should we slowly head towards
the climax?

518
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:21,040
You're ready, right?

519
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:39,651
Why do you guys put on firework shows
like they are party poppers?

520
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,594
That kid. He's cool.

521
00:45:46,696 --> 00:45:49,677
Was it so cool when I did it too?

522
00:45:55,316 --> 00:45:56,645
Anyway...

523
00:45:58,955 --> 00:46:02,131
What did Yi Jung sunbae say at the end?

524
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:06,053
What do you think he said?

525
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,784
In this situation, I don't need to hear
to know what he said.

526
00:46:09,557 --> 00:46:11,263
What's that?

527
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:16,107
Should we go up?

528
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:17,939
Go up where?

529
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,696
No.

530
00:46:29,197 --> 00:46:30,290
NO!

531
00:46:32,227 --> 00:46:35,896
Although he's my friend, Yi Jung's really
the player of all players.

532
00:46:36,197 --> 00:46:37,803
How can he come all the way to the hotel?

533
00:46:39,104 --> 00:46:41,873
I was wondering why he would be skating.

534
00:46:41,874 --> 00:46:44,133
Man, I didn't realize there was such
planning behind it.

535
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,117
Shut up!

536
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:47,195
Be quiet. I can't hear what they're
saying!

537
00:46:47,196 --> 00:46:50,052
Do you know how many stars this hotel has…
Do you think you'll be able to hear them?

538
00:46:50,053 --> 00:46:51,071
Then what?

539
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:52,670
Why don't you go outside and stand guard.

540
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:55,790
Oh, alright. Alright.

541
00:46:58,258 --> 00:46:59,195
Hey.

542
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:08,851
Gu Jun Pyo! Gu Jun Pyo!

543
00:47:08,852 --> 00:47:09,914
What's wrong?

544
00:47:10,563 --> 00:47:12,851
Hey. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

545
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:13,945
Why?

546
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:21,306
What do we do?

547
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:23,980
Looks like Yi Jung sunbae prepared that.

548
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,550
Do something!

549
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:28,937
What?

550
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:31,100
That's definitely an operational prop.

551
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:34,632
We can't let it go into the room.

552
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:35,685
Hey.

553
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,791
Let's bring that here.

554
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:38,494
What?

555
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,570
Hurry! Hurry!

556
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:44,531
Jeez.

557
00:47:44,532 --> 00:47:45,882
Hey.

558
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,242
Go quickly.

559
00:48:15,009 --> 00:48:15,863
Thank you.

560
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:32,237
Our plan was successful.

561
00:48:34,155 --> 00:48:35,851
Do you think things will work out?

562
00:48:35,852 --> 00:48:37,195
Who knows…

563
00:48:37,196 --> 00:48:39,851
Since they're a pretty impossible couple.

564
00:48:39,852 --> 00:48:42,497
We've done all we could, so we just have
to wait and see.

565
00:48:42,998 --> 00:48:44,845
You worked hard all day, Ga Eul.

566
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,416
Yeah, Woo Bin.

567
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:56,041
Yeah, we're about to head out.

568
00:48:56,717 --> 00:48:57,416
Alright.

569
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,780
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

570
00:49:36,124 --> 00:49:39,382
Though it's late, happy birthday.

571
00:49:39,383 --> 00:49:44,500
Though it's late, thanks for the present.

572
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:48,154
You got the present?

573
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:51,382
Although it's the cheapest present
I've ever received,

574
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,520
I've accepted it because it's the
thought that counts.

575
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,666
Though it's late...

576
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:09,541
congratulations on your engagement too.

577
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:11,726
I said not to pay attention to that.

578
00:50:12,811 --> 00:50:14,832
Unni is a good person too.

579
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:15,912
Unni?

580
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:19,248
She really...

581
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:26,091
really likes you.

582
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:33,835
I see you still can't mind your own
business.

583
00:50:35,592 --> 00:50:37,029
Alright.

584
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:39,945
You wouldn't be Geum Jan Di if you
didn't piss me off.

585
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:45,102
So what?

586
00:50:46,259 --> 00:50:49,350
Now that it happened, do you want me
to get married right away?

587
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:51,680
Would that make you feel better?

588
00:50:58,007 --> 00:51:03,000
Ah, what is Cho Ga Eul doing?

589
00:51:04,946 --> 00:51:06,772
I'm going to go out and see.

590
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:10,291
That useless girl.

591
00:51:31,342 --> 00:51:32,601
Nothing's going on, right?

592
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:34,945
Yes. All the preparations are going well.

593
00:51:34,946 --> 00:51:39,101
That's right. Master Jun Pyo is in one
of the rooms.

594
00:51:40,258 --> 00:51:44,291
Jun Pyo is in the hotel right now?

595
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:45,185
<i>Yes.</i>

596
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,041
What is this?

597
00:51:57,042 --> 00:51:59,695
Why can't I hear anything?

598
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,603
They couldn't possibly…

599
00:52:07,113 --> 00:52:08,405
You there.

600
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:17,063
What are you doing here?

601
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,177
H... hello.

602
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,940
You're a girl I can't put up with,
even though I try.

603
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:25,800
Or…

604
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,226
are you showing your true colors now?

605
00:52:33,969 --> 00:52:36,549
This is why I was so careful from
the start,

606
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,600
in not allowing him to mix with kids
from such ill-bred families!

607
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,800
Your words are too harsh.

608
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:49,060
We are not an ill-bred family.

609
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,030
If a young girl follows a boy so willingly
to a hotel is not ill-bred, then...

610
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:58,290
Hey, Geum Jan Di. You...

611
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,364
Why?

612
00:53:09,365 --> 00:53:12,409
Did you become anxious because Jun Pyo
got engaged,

613
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,009
so you decided to just throw your body
at him?

614
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,889
You detestable and audacious little...

615
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,654
Stop it!

616
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:25,271
Please.

617
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:27,771
Just stop it.

618
00:53:43,677 --> 00:53:45,718
Bring Jun Pyo and come out.

619
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:54,333
Young master.

620
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:53,833
Let's go, Young master.

621
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:09,517
[Send to Yoon Ji Hoo]

622
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,700
[Send]

623
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:24,011
[In the process of sending your message
to Yoon Ji Hoo]

624
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,314
Hello?

625
00:56:22,315 --> 00:56:23,864
Where are you?

626
00:56:23,865 --> 00:56:27,115
Uh, I'm at home.

627
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:29,333
Nothing's wrong, right?

628
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:32,020
There's nothing wrong.

629
00:56:34,156 --> 00:56:35,344
Yes…

630
00:56:36,241 --> 00:56:37,487
Yes...

631
00:58:03,781 --> 00:58:04,620
Sunbae.

632
00:58:09,062 --> 00:58:13,406
This place has become Geum Jan Di's home.

633
00:58:16,407 --> 00:58:19,374
I couldn't sleep at all and...

634
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:25,682
I thought I could get some air and get
some studying done…

635
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:55,389
Yeah, mom.

636
01:00:56,439 --> 01:00:58,155
What's wrong?

637
01:01:00,022 --> 01:01:01,624
Mom!

638
01:01:02,124 --> 01:01:04,710
Was there an accident?

639
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:07,114
Mom! Mom!

640
01:01:11,303 --> 01:01:12,939
What is it now?

641
01:01:44,248 --> 01:01:45,551
Honey.

642
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:50,279
Look at this.

643
01:01:51,311 --> 01:01:54,685
If you have any eyes, look at this.

644
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:57,966
What are we going to do now?

645
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:02,113
We're already having a hard time paying
off our interest.

646
01:02:02,114 --> 01:02:06,457
How could you consider paying off someone
else's debt?!

647
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,354
You see, this was before the situation
became so bad.

648
01:02:09,355 --> 01:02:14,154
- That friend asked to borrow my name.
- Just your name?!

649
01:02:14,155 --> 01:02:17,362
You just lent him your name, how could there
be repossession stickers everywhere?!

650
01:02:17,363 --> 01:02:18,487
Honey.

651
01:02:18,889 --> 01:02:21,050
Oh, my head.

652
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:22,466
My head.

653
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:26,778
Hello?

654
01:02:28,904 --> 01:02:34,873
Oh yes, this is Geum Il Bong and
Na Gong Ju's house.

655
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:37,688
The art center?

656
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:51,123
Oh yes. I'm sorry, but my parents aren't
feeling well.

657
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:55,951
Could I do it on their behalf?

658
01:02:56,659 --> 01:03:01,352
Well, it's troublesome for us if they
don't work for this long.

659
01:03:01,689 --> 01:03:03,113
I'm sorry.

660
01:03:03,749 --> 01:03:07,209
I'll do everything that's been piling up.

661
01:03:08,186 --> 01:03:12,612
Could you be a little lenient until
they get better?

662
01:03:13,645 --> 01:03:16,391
I'm going easy since you're such an
admirable young woman, alright?

663
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,310
Then, I'm leaving it to you.

664
01:03:24,364 --> 01:03:25,293
Thank you!
