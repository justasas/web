1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,636
They may fit the description
of the folks you're after.

2
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:08,671
Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:12,397
They got a photograph of them
in a convenience store.

4
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:14,336
- Surveillance camera?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:16,008
Texas.

6
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:21,248
Looks like they're headed
our way, boys. Let's go.

7
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:22,915
Got another cup?

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,748
- You don't mind drinking after me?
- Not at all.

9
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,684
Goddamn. Texas.

10
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:49,111
Think our people whacked that trooper?

11
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:52,206
We'll know when we see the photo.

12
00:00:55,285 --> 00:01:00,154
Hurricane is waiting on the bad guys
the way a kid waits for Christmas.

13
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:02,948
Hurricane is a force of nature.

14
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:04,954
I like old Hurricane.

15
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:09,129
He's a tremendous guy.

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,131
Guess what he told me?

17
00:01:13,804 --> 00:01:16,967
He wants to come to L.A.
And join the force.

18
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:20,305
- You're kidding.
- Honest to God.

19
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:24,310
He said he thought
that me and him and...

20
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:27,149
"Macintosh" would make a great team.

21
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:29,151
No shit.

22
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:32,817
He said he wanted a crack
at the big time.

23
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,158
What did you say?

24
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:39,660
I told him
it was an interesting idea.

25
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:43,996
That's the funniest thing
I ever heard.

26
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:50,500
Can you imagine that motherfucker
roaming around Parker Center?

27
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:56,005
He'll put a stopper in the bottle.

28
00:01:58,515 --> 00:02:01,177
That yokel won't last ten minutes.

29
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,510
Put a stopper in the bottle.

30
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:12,192
Hurricane, you know
no one's allowed back there.

31
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:16,226
- Just getting a candy bar.
- You gonna pay for it this time?

32
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,906
I saw your car parked out front.

33
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,732
Charlie relieved me a half hour ago.

34
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,539
Sorry I put you on the spot, Dud.

35
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:34,148
Dale, we didn't mean...

36
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:35,544
Oh, that's me.

37
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:37,383
This is 210.

38
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:41,055
I just got back from Little Rock
with that picture.

39
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:43,552
10-4. That's us.

40
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:46,893
You leave it.

41
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,577
Jimmy, you got it?

42
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:22,597
That's Ray.

43
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:26,027
And so that must be
our mystery girl, Fantasia.

44
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:32,275
Her name's not Fantasia.

45
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,435
It's Lila Walker.

46
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,317
Hey, Pluto.

47
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:46,986
What's happening?

48
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:48,655
How are you, Beaver?

49
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:51,824
They're cool.

50
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:53,993
Come on in.

51
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,000
- Come on in.
- Go ahead.

52
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:14,346
This is Fantasia. That's Ray.

53
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:19,178
That's Joey.
And the whining one on the couch is Kim.

54
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:20,946
She had a tooth yanked out.

55
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,852
Fuck you, Beaver.

56
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:28,024
Grab yourself a chair.

57
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:43,209
You want to sit down?

58
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,377
That's okay. I'm fine.

59
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:52,047
So where's this multitude of coke?

60
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:55,384
- Where's Billy?
- He ain't here.

61
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:58,724
I can see that. Where is he?

62
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:02,565
He's still in New Orleans.

63
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,564
New Orleans?

64
00:05:07,904 --> 00:05:09,565
When will he be here?

65
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:10,895
Tomorrow night.

66
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:15,734
He didn't tell me that
when we spoke.

67
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:18,706
He got hung up.

68
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:22,774
He didn't know that would happen
when he spoke to you.

69
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:29,447
We'll wait for him.

70
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:34,126
We can't wait. We have to go.

71
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:36,622
We'll wait until tomorrow.

72
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,225
We'll stay here.

73
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:43,465
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

74
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,464
We don't have much room, and...

75
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:53,316
Yeah, what the fuck, man.

76
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,478
You can have my room.

77
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:59,578
I've slept on the couch before.

78
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:03,481
Fuck you, Beaver.
I'm not moving.

79
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
Give me the phone.

80
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:08,887
Sometimes I think you haven't got
a brain in your head.

81
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:13,966
I'm going to Star City. The only reason
I got involved in this shit...

82
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:18,673
is so we'd get some money and I
could go home and see my people.

83
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:21,466
That was before
all this shit happened.

84
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:24,302
Now we have to get where we're going.

85
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:28,473
So what's the problem?
All you have to do is...

86
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,649
pick me up on the way.

87
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:35,981
You know that Pluto isn't going to
do that. You heard what the man said.

88
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:39,158
I think it's a good idea.

89
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:48,494
If she goes ahead of us,
it will be safer to travel.

90
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,668
We won't fit the description so easily.

91
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:56,175
No problem.

92
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,697
Ain't that some shit.

93
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:25,708
Can you make it a whole day
without me?

94
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:27,874
I don't know.

95
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:34,611
It looks like just
her brother and mama are there.

96
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,612
What kind of people are they?

97
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,319
Good people. Christian people.

98
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:42,757
I can't believe she got mixed up
in this shit.

99
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,823
Hurricane, how is it that
you know this Lila Walker.

100
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:51,160
I arrested her for shoplifting once.

101
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,662
She was just a kid in high school.

102
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:57,962
All she took was lipstick
and shit to put on her eyes.

103
00:07:58,174 --> 00:07:59,835
Wasn't worth ten bucks.

104
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:04,335
I could tell right off she wasn't bad,
just high-spirited.

105
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:09,175
So I decided to try to help her out.
You know, talk to her.

106
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:12,684
Then one day, she just disappeared.

107
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,016
Somebody said...

108
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,727
she took off for Hollywood
to become a movie star.

109
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:22,394
Anyway, that was about five years ago.

110
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:25,064
I didn't hear of her again till now.

111
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:27,735
She's moved up from stealing lipstick.

112
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:30,165
I don't believe she killed anybody.

113
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:35,737
That kid in the closet. She opens
the door, sees him, closes the door.

114
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,845
That proves she's not a killer.

115
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,910
Hurricane, that don't prove shit.

116
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,753
So, do we talk to the mother?

117
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:50,256
- What if she tips off Lila?
- She won't.

118
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:53,095
She wouldn't do that, not Lila.

119
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:54,896
Have you heard from her?

120
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:58,056
No, I haven't.
Not since last summer.

121
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:00,802
Some time around June or July.

122
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:03,396
Mr. Dixon, you know Lila.

123
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:05,964
She wouldn't do
what they're saying she did.

124
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,405
She must have been kidnapped.
Brainwashed.

125
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:14,410
Some of the best policemen
in this country...

126
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:16,745
are after Lila and those fellows.

127
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:18,817
They'll catch them, too.

128
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,323
It will help Lila
if she turns herself in.

129
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,321
Chief Dixon is right.

130
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:28,330
We can't promise anything,
but if she cooperates...

131
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:31,128
that will be
taken into account later.

132
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,569
I haven't heard from her, but if I do,
I'll tell her what you said.

133
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,537
Ronnie, have you heard
from your sister?

134
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:43,209
No, sir.

135
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,641
Would you tell us if you had?

136
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,147
Yes, sir.

137
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:53,556
Grandma...

138
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,387
I'm hungry.

139
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:58,386
Byron, don't bother us now, honey.

140
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:00,559
Who's that?

141
00:10:00,897 --> 00:10:02,728
That's Lila's boy.

142
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:08,601
Didn't you know Lila had a boy?

143
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,600
And he's a pretty boy, too.

144
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:21,278
Thanks for your time.
That's all we need for now.

145
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,384
They're not going to Jeremiah's at all.

146
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:28,955
No. Fantasia's coming home
to see her kid.

147
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:32,783
Hurricane, just how well
do you know this gal?

148
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,391
What do you mean?

149
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:36,628
You know what I mean.

150
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:39,298
Ha-ha. That's real fucking funny.

151
00:11:59,115 --> 00:12:00,309
Fuck!

152
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:06,144
Goddamn her.

153
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,304
Ronnie.

154
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,805
Look at you.
You done gone Hollywood.

155
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,478
Look at you, all grown up.

156
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:42,811
Stand back.
Let me have a look at you.

157
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:45,150
Yeah, you still ugly.

158
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:47,987
I'm just playing. You look fine.

159
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:51,016
I'm feeling fine.

160
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,124
I'm going to see my baby.
I'm going home.

161
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:00,195
You can't go home.
The cops are after you.

162
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:05,200
- What did they say?
- Get in the car.

163
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:10,143
I didn't do the things
they said I did.

164
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:11,543
I know that.

165
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:17,149
Being on the run
makes you look guilty.

166
00:14:17,753 --> 00:14:19,721
I already look guilty.

167
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:23,384
Looking guilty is being guilty
for black people.

168
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,553
You know that.
I won't get a fair trial...

169
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:28,921
and I won't go to prison.

170
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:31,433
Chief Dixon said that...

171
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,491
- Dale Dixon?
- Yeah.

172
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:35,696
He was the one
who came to the house.

173
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,440
Didn't you used to know him?

174
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:42,107
Yeah, I used to know him.

175
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:48,614
Ronnie, I didn't come
all this way not to see my baby.

176
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:52,281
They'll be watching our house...

177
00:14:52,622 --> 00:14:56,991
so you have to take me someplace
outside of town.

178
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:00,285
Then tonight you bring my baby
out to see me.

179
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,291
Then tomorrow I'll be gone.

180
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:04,459
Ronnie, please.

181
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:08,167
I'm your sister.
I need your help.

182
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,341
Okay, Lila.

183
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:22,843
A friend of mine's grandma died
a few months ago.

184
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,853
She had a house off the highway
past the bait shop.

185
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:34,019
No one's living there now.

186
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:42,436
I'll be out there all night,
so don't wait up.

187
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:45,334
Are Dud and John
going to be with you?

188
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:47,405
No, they're not.

189
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:50,735
We don't need 19 goddamn people
to watch a house.

190
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:52,742
I know you're capable of...

191
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:57,079
Just because I'm not from L.A.
Don't mean I can't watch a house.

192
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:01,687
Okay?

193
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:28,477
I love you.
You know that, don't you?

194
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:30,652
I know that.

195
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:36,481
And I love our little girl
more than anything.

196
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:39,655
I know that, too.

197
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:58,172
I would give you every dime
we talked about if I had the money.

198
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:01,306
The problem is, I don't have it.

199
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:08,977
Your partner's making me nervous.
Sit your ass down, ponytail.

200
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,352
I know you guys are on the run.

201
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:22,521
You need everything you can get.
It's better than nothing, right?

202
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:29,200
Let's lighten up.

203
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:33,038
This town is hot, and so are you.

204
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,877
You're on every goddamn channel.

205
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,709
You got no on else
you can trust but me.

206
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:45,280
I'm going to let you walk with one.

207
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:49,984
You can take it or leave it.

208
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:01,329
Fucker.

209
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,501
Eight fucking dollars. Who cares?

210
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,520
He has to have more money than that.

211
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:23,188
Let's go.

212
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:28,894
Pull over. We're splitting up.

213
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,826
What are you talking about?

214
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:33,227
Pull over. Everything's fucked up.

215
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:36,902
We'll split the money and the coke,
then I'm gone.

216
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:38,834
I ain't doing that.

217
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:41,907
Don't fuck with me.
Just give me my money.

218
00:19:42,278 --> 00:19:46,180
I can't do that.
I don't have any money.

219
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:49,116
- Say what?
- I said I don't have any money.

220
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:52,417
Where's my money?

221
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:56,021
I ain't got it.
She took the fucking money.

222
00:19:56,292 --> 00:20:00,524
I got $56. She took it.
Now let me go before I have a wreck.

223
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,455
You're a pussy-whipped fucker.

224
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:05,293
Don't give me that shit.

225
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,961
It was your fucking buddies
who had no money.

226
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,128
Your good friend, Billy.

227
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:15,470
What the fuck am I doing with you?
You're a pussy-whipped motherfucker!

228
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:21,405
If you want any money,
you'll have to go to Arkansas.

229
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,284
Lila, we got to go.

230
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:27,886
Just give me a few minutes with him.

231
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:30,287
It's almost four in the morning.

232
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,890
I know.

233
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:37,292
It's time for you to go home, go to bed
and get up and see your grandma.

234
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:40,833
I love you, honey.
Will you be a good boy?

235
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:43,334
Give me a kiss good-bye.

236
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:45,162
Come on, Lila.

237
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,843
Take care of my baby, okay?

238
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:53,671
Will you be all right?

239
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:59,844
Ronnie, put the money
in the bank, okay?

240
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:06,059
Ronnie, put the money
in the bank, okay?

241
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:13,825
Dale.

242
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,991
- How you doing?
- Stop right there.

243
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,496
Turn around.
Put your hands on the counter.

244
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:22,497
Spread your legs.

245
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:29,007
Simon says.

246
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:31,711
Can I turn around now?

247
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,971
Just stay like that.

248
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:53,063
Where are your two pals?

249
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:55,233
Ray and Pluto?

250
00:22:57,406 --> 00:22:59,067
They'll be here soon.

251
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:01,669
How soon is that?

252
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:03,408
I don't know.

253
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:05,743
They have to call first.

254
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:13,444
How do I know you're not lying?
They might show up here any minute.

255
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,457
I'm not lying to you, Dale.

256
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,461
What will you do with me?

257
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:28,126
Get in the other room.

258
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:30,068
Go on.

259
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,477
Go into the living room.

260
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:44,813
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.

261
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,180
What are you doing?

262
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:48,186
Two fellows from L.A.
Want to meet you.

263
00:23:48,457 --> 00:23:51,449
- Put the phone down.
- Why?

264
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:55,527
Ray and Pluto will call here
to see if everything is cool.

265
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:59,027
I won't answer the phone
if you call those cops.

266
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:00,858
Yes, you will.

267
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,701
Goddamn it!

268
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:13,712
Lila, even if I wanted to,
I can't help you.

269
00:24:16,885 --> 00:24:19,046
I don't have the legal authority.

270
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:23,415
You didn't have the authority
to fuck me when I was 17...

271
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:25,592
but that didn't stop you.

272
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:31,357
That's right.

273
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:34,258
Instead of spying on me...

274
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:37,099
why didn't you come in
and say hello to your son?

275
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:38,605
He's not my kid.

276
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:42,537
Not your kid?
He's nearly as white as you are.

277
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:44,109
That proves nothing.

278
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:46,108
Are you calling me a whore?

279
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:58,460
I was a virgin when we met,
and you know it.

280
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:10,265
Hear the whippoorwill?

281
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:15,668
Remember what you said
about hearing a whippoorwill?

282
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:21,512
It means somebody's going to die.

283
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:40,557
Why do we have to
sit here in the dark?

284
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:43,999
I don't want to be a sitting duck
if they show up.

285
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:47,731
I told you,
they won't be here until they call.

286
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,845
- Where you going?
- My cigarettes are in my purse.

287
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,412
- Get one of mine.
- I smoke menthol.

288
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,014
I'll get them.

289
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:10,095
I forgot that thing
was even in there.

290
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,398
Ray gave it to me for protection.

291
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,238
I don't know how it works.

292
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:19,467
You pull the damn trigger.

293
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:24,475
Why are you looking at me like that?

294
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:29,150
Did you think I would shoot you?
That's crazy.

295
00:26:29,818 --> 00:26:32,309
Now can I have
my cigarettes, please?

296
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,159
You have a light, baby?

297
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:05,379
Does your wife treat you right?

298
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:07,552
Yes, Lila, she does.

299
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:09,390
That's good.

300
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:14,555
What's her name again?
Thelma Lou?

301
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:21,402
Cheryl Ann.

302
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:23,904
That's right.

303
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,932
And you and Cheryl Ann have
a little girl.

304
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:30,275
What's her name?

305
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:32,210
Bonnie.

306
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:34,615
How old is she?

307
00:27:35,651 --> 00:27:36,948
Eight.

308
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:41,889
You don't like telling me
about your family, do you?

309
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:44,048
No, I guess I don't.

310
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,887
I don't blame you.

311
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,630
- I got something for you.
- Where are you going?

312
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:54,630
Don't shoot me, Officer.

313
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,138
What the hell are you doing now?

314
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,934
- Can I turn on the light?
- No.

315
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:06,311
I put it in here to keep it fresh.

316
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:09,410
Can we leave this open
to get some light?

317
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,652
This is our baby's birthday cake.

318
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:22,586
I don't want any.

319
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,996
Suit yourself.

320
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:31,602
It's good.

321
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,001
You should try some.

322
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,837
Today's his birthday?

323
00:28:37,713 --> 00:28:40,181
No. It was in September.

324
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:42,839
I missed it.

325
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:47,052
I left him with Mama
before he was two years old.

326
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:49,890
That means
I've missed four birthdays...

327
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:53,820
so we celebrated all four of them
last night.

328
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:57,558
Does your mama know about...

329
00:28:57,933 --> 00:28:59,230
Know what?

330
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:04,232
No, I never told her.
I never meant you any trouble, Dale.

331
00:29:05,073 --> 00:29:06,734
I still don't.

332
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:12,407
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know
she had a half-brother in Nigger Town.

333
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:19,084
You should have some
of our baby's cake...

334
00:29:19,354 --> 00:29:21,083
Quit calling him that.

335
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:23,187
Why? That's what he is.

336
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:26,893
Damn it.
I told you I didn't want any.

337
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:31,225
- Do you want this?
- What are you doing?

338
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:33,798
- This is what you want.
- Cut it out.

339
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:38,295
Cut it out, goddamn it!

340
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:46,072
Why did you ever fuck with me?

341
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:53,751
Me and Ronnie's daddy was white,
did you know that?

342
00:29:56,424 --> 00:29:58,415
Of course, we never knew him.

343
00:29:59,327 --> 00:30:01,488
He had another family.

344
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:07,600
That's why I kind of look white.
Because my daddy was white.

345
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:11,204
And you figured
since I kind of look white...

346
00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:13,866
you could fuck me,
what the hell.

347
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:17,879
Because I was kind of black...

348
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:20,881
you could dump me, what the hell.

349
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:01,619
211 to 210.

350
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:05,553
211 to 210.

351
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:08,626
211 to 210.

352
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:11,288
Dale, where are you at?

353
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:21,506
Hey, June.

354
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,342
Juney! How are you doing?

355
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,108
You got something for me?

356
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,110
Hi, Mr. Charlie.

357
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:28,598
Is this Ronnie? Ronnie, this is Ray.
Is Fantasia there?

358
00:32:29,277 --> 00:32:30,608
Yeah, Lila.

359
00:32:31,446 --> 00:32:32,538
Where is she?

360
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:38,878
Have you got a number
out there for her?

361
00:32:42,357 --> 00:32:44,484
Give it to me, all right?

362
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:54,494
Ronnie! Ronnie, come here.

363
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,497
- Come here.
- I got to go.

364
00:33:03,178 --> 00:33:06,306
If you know something
about Lila being here...

365
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:08,110
you tell these gentlemen.

366
00:33:08,183 --> 00:33:10,674
I don't want you
being in trouble, too.

367
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:14,352
No, ma'am. I don't know
nothing about that.

368
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,717
June Hawkins told me he was
out last night digging frogs.

369
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:24,998
Driving back, he saw you driving
in front of him with Byron in the car.

370
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,068
Why were you out with Byron
at 4 A. M?

371
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:29,997
We've been here all night.

372
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:33,230
June's mixed up. He's old.
He don't see so well.

373
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:35,398
I'll make the bastard talk!

374
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,837
He won't talk.
It's his sister.

375
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:42,583
Can I speak to the boy?

376
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:47,414
- How are you this morning?
- Fine.

377
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:49,849
- Pretty sleepy?
- I guess so.

378
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:53,094
- Did you go out with Ronnie last night?
- No.

379
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:54,350
- You sure?
- Yeah.

380
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,522
- You didn't see a pretty lady?
- No.

381
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:57,889
You sure?

382
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:01,401
- Did Uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
- Yeah.

383
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:07,567
So this has just been pretend?

384
00:34:09,444 --> 00:34:12,777
What do you say we stop
playing pretend and play really?

385
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:18,512
And you really should spend a night
in jail.

386
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:20,718
So you don't tell your sister.

387
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:39,103
You got to let me go.

388
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,941
I can't do that, Lila.

389
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:48,949
You can't let them put me in jail.

390
00:34:50,618 --> 00:34:54,486
What's going to happen to our baby
with me in jail?

391
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:57,455
Your mom
will keep taking care of him.

392
00:35:01,296 --> 00:35:03,457
I'll give her money for him.

393
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:06,790
Why won't you give him the money?

394
00:35:10,638 --> 00:35:13,630
Why don't you just say,
"Byron, I'm your daddy?"

395
00:35:20,515 --> 00:35:22,346
I don't see how that would...

396
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:29,683
I guess it wouldn't be
a good idea, huh?

397
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:36,691
I guess it would be better
just to put me in jail...

398
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:39,864
and forget about
your 5-year-old son.

399
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,190
Hi, baby.

400
00:36:08,096 --> 00:36:10,087
Yeah, everything's cool.

401
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:12,426
Everything's real cool.

402
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:15,600
Ray, where are you calling from?

403
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:21,606
What's the name
of the gas station?

404
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,942
Ray, you missed the turnoff.

405
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:31,775
It's about half a mile back
up the highway.

406
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:38,823
You turn right at this place
called Cothern's Bait Shop.

407
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:41,818
There's a little road there.

408
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:48,700
You're not far, baby.
Just about ten minutes away. Hurry.

409
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:52,929
Yeah, I miss you.

410
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:23,230
Is that the road, Byron?

411
00:37:25,173 --> 00:37:26,731
I don't think so.

412
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,338
You don't think so?

413
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,573
When they arrive, get them
in the house and away from the car.

414
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:41,012
Open the door, talk to them.
Let them see everything is okay.

415
00:37:41,456 --> 00:37:44,687
Then stay in the kitchen
until I say to come out.

416
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:49,419
Then if they get trigger-happy,
you'll be out of the line of fire.

417
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,968
Then you'll let me go?

418
00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:02,640
I'll let you go.

419
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:18,482
Is that the road you went down?

420
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:40,374
Don't fuck around in there.
In and out. Got me?

421
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:43,878
What do you think I'd do?
Don't worry.

422
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:00,557
You sure this is it?

423
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:04,397
Yeah.

424
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:01,277
You got it straight? Do you?

425
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:14,427
Hi, baby.

426
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:18,765
Come on, Fantasia. Let's go.

427
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:21,998
It'll be a few minutes.
I have to pack my stuff.

428
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:26,175
What stuff?
All you had was your purse.

429
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:28,449
It won't be long.
Come on in.

430
00:41:28,883 --> 00:41:30,180
Shit!

431
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:32,345
I'll be back.

432
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,388
That's bullshit.
I'm sticking on your ass.

433
00:41:42,196 --> 00:41:44,687
She better not have bought
any clothes.

434
00:41:46,534 --> 00:41:48,229
What does she have to pack?

435
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:50,527
- Come on.
- Be careful. I love you.

436
00:41:50,605 --> 00:41:52,596
Did you spend any of my money?

437
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,436
Fantasia.

438
00:41:58,112 --> 00:41:59,443
Where did she go?

439
00:41:59,714 --> 00:42:04,378
Police officer, freeze! Hands up,
or I'll blow you to fucking hell!

440
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,111
- What the fuck?
- Get on the floor! Now!

441
00:42:08,222 --> 00:42:09,814
Who the fuck are you?

442
00:42:09,924 --> 00:42:11,289
- You bitch!
- Shut up!

443
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:14,288
- Shut up!
- Why the fuck did you do this?

444
00:42:14,562 --> 00:42:16,621
- I'm sorry.
- Stay back!

445
00:44:05,172 --> 00:44:06,503
210.

446
00:44:09,043 --> 00:44:13,343
210, A-1 channel 1.
Come in, goddamn it. Hurry up.

447
00:44:13,681 --> 00:44:16,673
Hurricane, where the hell
have you been?

448
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:18,678
I need help out here.

449
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:20,511
What's your 10-20?

450
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:22,348
Oh, God.

451
00:44:22,657 --> 00:44:25,319
Dale, what's your twenty?
Where are you?

452
00:44:25,493 --> 00:44:30,396
I'm off the highway,
two miles down Sulphur Springs Road.

453
00:44:30,765 --> 00:44:35,065
There's a house, and there's woods...
there's this house...

454
00:44:35,403 --> 00:44:37,064
Is there an address?

455
00:44:37,405 --> 00:44:40,067
I don't know the goddamn address.

456
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:43,241
Just send some help.
And an ambulance.

457
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:46,742
I got three suspects down,
and I'm hurt pretty bad.

458
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:48,742
Three suspects down.

459
00:44:49,283 --> 00:44:51,012
You know Sulphur Springs Road?

460
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:53,250
Hold on, Byron.

461
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:16,242
Charlie, do something.

462
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,139
Dud, come on!
Charlie'll taking care of it. Come on!

463
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:32,656
This is 211 to base.

464
00:45:32,927 --> 00:45:36,829
Send an ambulance
to Sulphur Springs Road right away.

465
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:51,204
That son of a bitch nailed them.

466
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:04,888
Hey, man.

467
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,895
The ambulance is on the way.
I'll get you some blankets, okay?

468
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,380
Are you dead, mister?

469
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:30,109
Are you dead, mister?

470
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:34,955
No, not quite.

471
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:37,280
Where's the lady at?

472
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,286
She's over there.

473
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:43,495
Don't go away. Come back.
Come stay with me.

474
00:46:50,504 --> 00:46:51,801
Stay here with me.

475
00:46:52,106 --> 00:46:54,574
How did you get blood on yourself?

476
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:56,806
I got in a fight.

477
00:46:59,814 --> 00:47:02,180
What do you do with your keys?

478
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:07,680
I lock things up.

479
00:47:08,856 --> 00:47:11,518
Come here.
I can't see your face.

480
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:14,190
Come a little closer.

481
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:19,198
Your name...

482
00:47:20,334 --> 00:47:21,801
is Byron.

483
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:27,200
You're five years old?

484
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:29,373
Four or five?

485
00:47:29,643 --> 00:47:30,974
Five.

486
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:35,208
Just come sit with me.
