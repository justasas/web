1
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,241
-Who is it?
-Fantasia.

2
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,295
Hey, girl.

3
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:35,632
-I thought you were going to Star City.
-I am tonight.

4
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,047
You think you're bad with that camera.

5
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:39,506
Come on.

6
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:42,210
You're ruining the shot
with your lousy dancing.

7
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,091
Bobby, look who's here.

8
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:48,433
-How you doing?
-Fine.

9
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:50,930
-Is Ray with you?
-No.

10
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:54,020
-That's good.
-That's real good.

11
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,686
You know you're always welcome here.
You got here just in time.

12
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:00,906
Bobby's about to blow out
the candles on his birthday cake.

13
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:03,903
It's your birthday? How old are you, 60?

14
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:05,862
That's your IQ, woman.

15
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,540
This is Darren and Danielle.

16
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:18,956
I left my purse in the car. I'll be right back.

17
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,386
What are you guys doing?

18
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:28,553
Everybody get on the floor and be quiet.

19
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:31,638
-What the fuck?
-Get on the floor, goddamn it!

20
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:34,311
Let go, Ray.

21
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:41,442
Down.

22
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:43,853
Fantasia!

23
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,399
Be quiet and everything will be okay.

24
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,452
-Where does Marco live?
-I don't know.

25
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:01,542
-I said, where does he live?
-I don't know.

26
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:03,924
-Where, goddamn it?
-I don't know!

27
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:07,385
How do you get your shit?
Does it fly over here?

28
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:11,056
-Ray, please.
-You don't know nothing about this.

29
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,938
If we tell anybody where Marco lives,
he'll kill us.

30
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:19,270
What do you think we're going to do?

31
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:22,143
Tell me or I'll slap your head off.

32
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,694
Leave us alone!

33
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:27,189
You don't have to hit her like that.

34
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,615
Tell him and everything will be okay.

35
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:34,279
Jackie don't know where Marco's staying.
I deal with him, she don't.

36
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,996
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.

37
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:46,916
Who is it?

38
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,588
It's Bobby, Marco.

39
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:50,803
I've got to get something from you.

40
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:53,766
-I told you not to come so late.
-Come on, man.

41
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,468
I got to get something tonight.

42
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,142
Come on in here, man.

43
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:06,153
This is a pretty woman you got here.

44
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,694
Look at those titties. I like those.

45
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:10,822
Ray, what are you doing?

46
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:13,322
-Hey, man!
-I want some of this.

47
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:17,822
What you want is on that table.
I got $200 in my wallet. Take it.

48
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:21,872
-I ain't fucking around.
-Take the money and the coke.

49
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:24,249
-This is lighter fluid.
-You're sick.

50
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:27,923
I'll fuck her up.
I don't want your little $200.

51
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:30,671
Fuck you. I don't want your $200.

52
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:31,798
Stop it!

53
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:34,420
-Then you got the money?
-Put it out!

54
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,469
-I'll light her up! Fuck you!
-Put it out!

55
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:40,633
Fuck you!

56
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:43,971
Motherfucker!

57
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:09,714
Goddamn.

58
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:12,212
Goddamn.

59
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:19,379
Got it?

60
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,288
They got a fucking kid.

61
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:14,910
Goddamn it, you motherfucker.
Where's your goddamn kid?

62
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:16,952
Where's your goddamn kid?

63
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,257
Go look for the kid.
We can't leave him here.

64
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:23,253
I've been all over the house.

65
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:26,754
I don't give a shit! Go look for him.
He might be hiding.

66
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:00,765
Mommyl Mommyl

67
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,810
Honey, what's wrong? What is it, baby?

68
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,150
It's okay, Daddy's here.

69
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:10,905
She had a bad dream.

70
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:14,524
You okay? I'll take her in our room.

71
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:17,734
Are you okay?

72
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:22,283
Dale, are you coming to bed?

73
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,991
Yeah, I'll be right there.

74
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,399
Good. Come on, Dud,
let's get to the wallets.

75
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,701
Watch your feet.

76
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,325
I need a name.

77
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,671
Let's do this body first.
I think this is our stranger.

78
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,460
Who do we got?

79
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,968
John, meet Robert Prost.

80
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,138
How do you do, Robert?

81
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,432
Watch your feet.

82
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,313
We're out of here.

83
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,254
-Isn't that a light in Robert's window?
-Yeah. At 10:00 in the morning.

84
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:31,008
Shit!

85
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,215
John!

86
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,889
Anything on that tape?

87
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:39,642
Some background voices.

88
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:40,770
You?

89
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:42,640
Nothing.

90
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,609
How did you ID this Ray Malcolm?

91
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:49,991
A neighbour recognised
Ray's car parked out front.

92
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:53,120
Did they see him?

93
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:57,956
She did see a black guy with glasses
come out, get in Ray's car and split.

94
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:04,415
Didn't know Ray's last name. Said he was
staying with some dopers. We checked.

95
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,585
You separated it?

96
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:09,838
Not yet. Is that Ray's package?

97
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:12,046
So who's this black guy?

98
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,340
They call him Pluto.

99
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:17,850
He's been hanging with Ray
the last couple of weeks.

100
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:20,393
I'd say he's from out of town.

101
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:23,140
Pluto? That's it?

102
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:24,771
For now.

103
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:26,396
Who's the girl?

104
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,361
-Fantasia.
-Bullshit.

105
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:30,904
Good-looking. Ray's old lady.

106
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,275
Listen to this.

107
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:48,629
Hey, girl. I thoughtyou were going
to Star City tonight.

108
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:51,291
Bobby, look who's here.

109
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:56,756
Sounds like she said,
"I thought you're going to...." what?

110
00:14:56,932 --> 00:15:00,181
It sounds like,
"I thought you were going to Star City."

111
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:03,520
Then the other girl says something.
Play it again.

112
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:13,191
Hey, girl.

113
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:16,400
-I thoughtyou were going to Star City.
-I am tonight.

114
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:20,530
It is Star City.
"I thought you were going to Star City."

115
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,116
Dud, check this out.

116
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,415
A robbery arrest from '79.

117
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:29,453
In case of emergency, notify....

118
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,752
"Jeremiah Malcolm. Relationship: Uncle.

119
00:15:33,258 --> 00:15:36,674
"Star City, Arkansas." I'll be damned.

120
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,223
Jimmy, are you there?

121
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:44,558
Yeah, Dale. Come on back.

122
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:49,182
I went to the courthouse
and checked the records on Ray Malcolm.

123
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:53,019
He was born here,
but hasn't lived here in 20 years.

124
00:15:53,404 --> 00:15:55,645
I'm heading to the uncle's place now.

125
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:59,901
Do me a favour. Call Charlie,
tell him to come to work early tonight.

126
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:03,239
I'm staying out there
in case those folks show up.

127
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,827
If they do, we're going to be
laying for them.

128
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:13,746
This could be a big one.
I'll talk to you later. 10-4.

129
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,788
10-4 and out.

130
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:23,137
Just give their names,
Ray Malcolm and Pluto Franklin.

131
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,841
Give a description of the girl.
Say the victims were stabbed to death.

132
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,472
How many stab wounds?

133
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,642
Don't mention that.
Or the hog-tying and pillowcases.

134
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:34,643
-And the other three?
-Say they were strangled.

135
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,526
What about the kid?

136
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:40,482
Don't mention the kid.
Just say there was a survivor.

137
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,576
And that we think the suspects fled
the state. We might get national coverage.

138
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:52,123
You got to give me something.
The press is all over my butt.

139
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:57,997
-Say they're as violent as we've seen.
-Really?

140
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:00,587
Thank you.

141
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:04,799
What's the story on this Star City thing?

142
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,683
Somebody, come on. Dud.

143
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,426
Would it be a wild goose chase
if you went there?

144
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:15,398
We've been lucky so far.
And we can tie Ray there.

145
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:20,568
I talked to the police chief.
He didn't know of Ray or Fantasia...

146
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,067
...but he's gonna check the uncle out.

147
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,483
I'm waiting for his call.

148
00:17:27,703 --> 00:17:30,822
What about an ID on the second suspect?

149
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:34,243
Pluto. His real name is Lenny Franklin.

150
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,040
He's originally from Chicago.

151
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:40,331
He and Ray got busted
about six years ago...

152
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:43,466
...for another drug rip off. Same shit.

153
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:47,134
They did two years together
in San Quentin.

154
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:49,001
Prison buddies.

155
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:50,515
Pluto's a piece of work.

156
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:53,471
IQ of 150 and a college graduate.

157
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:56,262
We think he did the stabbings.

158
00:17:56,564 --> 00:18:00,263
His package indicates
he's very fond of a knife.

159
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:02,019
He has three priors.

160
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:05,447
For some reason,
he left the videotape playing.

161
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,567
Sick son of a bitch.

162
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:11,404
There were no prints,
so he left a calling card.

163
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:12,615
He's here.

164
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:18,739
Cole here.

165
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,038
Put him through.

166
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:23,997
Chief Dixon, this is Dud--

167
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:26,925
I'm fine, thank--

168
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:31,342
Put him on the box.
What did you say his name was?

169
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:35,470
Chief Dale Dixon. Chief,
I'm putting you on the speaker phone.

170
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:40,515
Chief Jenkins is here.

171
00:18:42,023 --> 00:18:44,313
Los Angeles Chief of Police, Jenkins?

172
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:47,024
No shit. It's a pleasure to meetyou.

173
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:48,612
Good to meet you.

174
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:53,989
-Now what we want to talk about--
-Guess you're pretty busy out there.

175
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:57,277
-Sure.
-I'll bet.

176
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,952
You gotsix people dead out there
at the same time.

177
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,743
That don't happen much here.

178
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,914
Sometimes we get a stabbing.
Coloured boys, generally.

179
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,505
Every other Saturday night...

180
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:10,549
...one of them sticks another one
over a card game.

181
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:15,671
-We should discuss the--
-Craps sometimes.

182
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:20,429
Now you wanted to know about
this boy's uncle. I think we hit thejackpot.

183
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:25,564
I went to the uncle's place.
It's the damnedest hideout I've ever seen.

184
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:28,861
It's in the woods,
about six miles northeast of town.

185
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:31,607
The only way there is over an old,
rickety bridge.

186
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,107
You'd never find it
if you didn't know where to look.

187
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:38,736
You city boys would be lost in ten minutes.

188
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,404
But I'm ready, don't worry.

189
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:42,655
Damn, Bonnie.

190
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,369
-Excuse me?
-Nothing.

191
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:48,036
They were out of onion rings,
so I gotyou Tasty Taters.

192
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:51,169
It's L.A., Cheryl Ann, and Chief Jenkins.

193
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:55,298
Yes, sir.

194
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:58,507
So you think this is a promising avenue
of investigation?

195
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:03,635
It's promising all right. Me and
my deputies can set up a surveillance now.

196
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:08,558
Chief Dixon, why don't we hold off on that
until we get a game plan.

197
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,306
Ifyou say so.

198
00:20:12,152 --> 00:20:13,611
That would be best.

199
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:18,563
It's my job. We'll get the sons of bitches.
I'll be waiting on you.

200
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:58,479
What are you two doing here?
When did you get back?

201
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:01,193
-Wednesday night.
-Wednesday night?

202
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,368
That's no honeymoon.
You should have stayed longer.

203
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:08,612
Earl had to get back to work
and I'm starting a new job next week.

204
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:10,373
What are you going to be doing?

205
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:13,454
Bookkeeping at the Rice Mill.
Muriel retired...

206
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:17,502
...so I talked to Old Man Hosey
and he hired me.

207
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:19,585
Take it easy.

208
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:23,008
Dale?

209
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,549
Well, that's good. Congratulations.

210
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:30,728
-Thank you, Dale.
-We better be going.

211
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,965
You want some of this?

212
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:08,177
Why don't you put some clothes on?

213
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:18,771
I told you to put some clothes on.

214
00:22:21,986 --> 00:22:23,777
Ray, those people are dead.

215
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:27,281
Those people are dead.

216
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:29,864
No shit.

217
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:33,246
And you were there.

218
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:35,576
Don't forget that.

219
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:41,420
Didn't I tell you
to put some goddamn clothes on?

220
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:59,186
We got enough of this shit
to last us until 1995.

221
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:02,894
We got enough to last
until we get to Houston.

222
00:23:03,777 --> 00:23:05,816
We're not selling all this shit.

223
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:08,401
We're selling it to Billy in Houston.

224
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:11,989
I'm going back to Chicago.
I don't give a fuck what you do.

225
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:15,449
Riding up and down the road
don't make sense.

226
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:19,116
What do you think will happen?
Are we going to get in trouble?

227
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:23,457
I was planning to sell some to
them country sons of bitches in Arkansas.

228
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,127
Man, I don't like this Arkansas shit.

229
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:30,381
We'll be in and out. Don't worry.

230
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:32,712
We're not building a house.

231
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,800
It's not a problem.
What are you worried about?

232
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,061
What the fuck do you think?

233
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,018
I don't get you.

234
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:50,727
Why don't you loosen up
and have some fun?

235
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,862
Why don't you get high with Ray and me?

236
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,451
Don't you want to feel good?

237
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:11,047
This is the biggest thing
that ever happened to us.

238
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:14,296
And you're just sitting there
like a little brown turd.

239
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:17,551
Goddamn it!

240
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:19,175
Watch yourself, Ray.

241
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:23,719
Listen up, motherfucker. Listen up!

242
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:29,232
This is what will happen.
We will go to Houston and sell the shit...

243
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:32,611
...because this little $15,000 won't last.

244
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,819
Until then, I will hold onto the blow.

245
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,037
And Ray, I don't want to hear
any more bullshit out of you...

246
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,695
...or her.

247
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:58,135
You son of a bitch!

248
00:24:59,638 --> 00:25:01,298
Fucking son of a bitch!

249
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:06,223
Why don't you just go to sleep, fucker?

250
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:10,804
You forgot just one fucking thing.

251
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,234
You forgot about the money.
I have all the goddamn money.

252
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,401
You keep that little $15,000, Ray.

253
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:22,116
He's right, baby.

254
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:25,951
We should sell the stuff in Houston.
Think of all the money.

255
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:31,958
We'll be okay.
Pluto knows people in Chicago.

256
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:35,076
We can live off that money for a long time.

257
00:25:36,383 --> 00:25:38,671
Come on, baby, it's going to be okay.

258
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:43,881
We can buy all the blow we want
when we get there.

259
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:46,635
We'll be safe.

260
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:49,393
Pluto will take care of us.

261
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:52,181
We'll be safe, baby.

262
00:26:31,227 --> 00:26:32,934
This is really beautiful.

263
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:35,019
It's as green as hell.

264
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,981
You know I'm a country boy.

265
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,315
That's crap. You were born in L.A.

266
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:42,524
Malibu.

267
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:52,703
What the fuck?

268
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,836
Howdy.

269
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:10,096
Welcome to Star City. We've got
a full day, so follow me to the motel...

270
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:13,385
...you can unpack
and we'll get something to eat.

271
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:17,551
When I saw you drive by,
I knew you were the boys from California.

272
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,601
Cops look the same everywhere, I guess.

273
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,314
Follow me.

274
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:29,813
Oh, shit.

275
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:50,091
You boys are in for a treat.

276
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:53,927
Fern, can we get some more biscuits?

277
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:57,010
-Sure, Hurricane.
-And more coffee.

278
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:58,681
Hurricane?

279
00:27:58,853 --> 00:28:01,688
Some folks call me that.
I never figured out why.

280
00:28:04,274 --> 00:28:08,403
We can wait in the woods.
When the bad folks show up...

281
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:11,605
...we'll put the stopper in the bottle.

282
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:14,195
They'll be sorry they ever heard
of Star City.

283
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,489
This is good.

284
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,077
My mother used to make food like this.

285
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:20,913
Thanks. How's Walter?

286
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:23,165
He had gallbladder surgery.

287
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:26,745
Good for him. I'll be giving you boys
my full cooperation.

288
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:29,255
Me and my two deputies...

289
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,291
...will take turns watching the place
around the clock.

290
00:28:34,052 --> 00:28:38,845
So you boys can just relax, drink beer,
chase chicks, and whatever.

291
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:40,635
We'll help.

292
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:42,927
-We'll help you.
-Suit yourself.

293
00:28:44,397 --> 00:28:46,519
Another thing. Old Man Malcolm...

294
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:50,851
...l guarantee he don't know jack-shit
about what his nephew did.

295
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,441
Did you talk to him?

296
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,904
Not yet. I just know. There aren't even
any telephone lines up there.

297
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:03,201
He's a hermit.
Hardly ever leaves his property.

298
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,490
I think we ought to talk to him
and let him know.

299
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:09,954
-That may be the case, but--
-Charlie! Get on in here.

300
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:12,877
This is my deputy. Retired police officer.

301
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:15,168
Charlie, this is Dud Cole.

302
00:29:16,594 --> 00:29:19,050
And this is Dan Macintosh.

303
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:21,055
John. John McFeely.

304
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:25,384
Oh, right. All them Mac names
sound alike to me.

305
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:28,772
-You eaten, Charlie?
-Yeah, Jocelyn fixed me--

306
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,979
Charlie's a Yankee from Detroit.

307
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:35,310
Dale, if we talk to this guy
and he's involved--

308
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:38,822
-I told you he's not.
-Hurricane. I mean, Dale.

309
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:41,199
These are dangerous people.

310
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:42,904
I understand that.

311
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,906
You boys about ready?

312
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:49,240
Just a second.

313
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:50,741
Here, Fern.

314
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:52,539
Keep the change.

315
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:55,673
There is no change, Hurricane.
It's a $12 check...

316
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,708
...and you gave me a ten!

317
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:59,171
Catch you later.

318
00:29:59,553 --> 00:30:01,047
Is he gone?

319
00:30:01,263 --> 00:30:04,512
I haven't had a full meal
since I met the son of a bitch.

320
00:30:05,642 --> 00:30:07,100
Go ahead, Jimmy.

321
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:10,513
It's Harlan Childress. Lureen called.
He's raising hell.

322
00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:15,055
I'm on a case here. Unless he's trying
to kill her, I don't have time.

323
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,525
She said he's trying to kill her.

324
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:20,278
I'mjustletting you know.

325
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:21,817
Okay, 10-4.

326
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:25,941
Hop in. We have to make a little stop
before we go to the Malcolm place.

327
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:41,211
Open this door!

328
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:42,926
Goddamn it! Lureen!

329
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:47,138
Harlan! Goddamn it.

330
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:54,929
-Settle down, Harlan!
-Let go!

331
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:58,651
Harlan, goddamn it!

332
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:06,116
You calm down now. Calm down.

333
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:08,692
Do you want to take a ride with me?

334
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:14,161
-Settle down.
-He was out all night drinking.

335
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,619
Who are those men?

336
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,243
It's okay.

337
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,956
She locked me out of the kitchen.

338
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,550
I understand.

339
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,971
You were out all night drinking.

340
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:32,767
You knew she was going to do this,
didn't you?

341
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,392
If you apologise, she may let you in.

342
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:38,933
He knows I will.

343
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,016
We'll go to church, he'll feel better.

344
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,562
All right, Lureen.

345
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,361
-You won't let them take him away?
-They're with me. They're from L.A.

346
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,161
Get up. Pull yourself together, okay?
Come on.

347
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,244
Come on. Get up.

348
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,751
Now come here.

349
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:04,455
Do me a favour.
Put this axe back in the shed.

350
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,704
All right?

351
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:10,716
I don't want to have to come back
out here. Are you okay?

352
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,216
I'm okay.

353
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:17,473
Put that axe in the shed.
And fix this window.

354
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,978
-Tell Cheryl Ann and the baby I said hi.
-Tell them hi.

355
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,854
-Sorry about the window.
-That's okay.

356
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,022
It's okay, boys. I'm out here twice a week.

357
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:04,975
Motherfucker!

358
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:11,310
Goddamn it! They know me now.
Are you aware of that, bitch?

359
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,486
They know my face, my name,
probably how long my dick is!

360
00:33:16,534 --> 00:33:20,532
A goddamn kid! Why didn't you tell me
about that fucking kid?

361
00:33:20,663 --> 00:33:23,237
I swear to God, I didn't see any kid!

362
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:25,951
He must have been hiding.

363
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,415
Quit lying!

364
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:32,089
Don't hit me no more.
Pluto, don't let him hit me no more.

365
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,628
Get rid of her, Ray.

366
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:37,011
We'll be okay.

367
00:33:37,138 --> 00:33:40,471
-Shut up.
-We'll dump the car. They won't find us.

368
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:42,342
They won't find you maybe!

369
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:44,219
They won't find us!

370
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,307
-It'll be okay.
-Get your hand off of me.

371
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:49,225
We'll be okay.

372
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:01,527
Isn't there another way, Dale?

373
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:04,234
Watch your step. The timbers are rotten.

374
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:06,455
Yeah, rotten.

375
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:10,826
I crashed my motorcycle
on this bridge when I was 14.

376
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,249
The volunteer fire department
had to put it out.

377
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:18,919
You can still see some of the burn marks.

378
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:29,391
Perfect hideout.

379
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:31,016
-Is the old man there?
-Yeah.

380
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:33,818
-I wonder who else is there.
-He's by himself.

381
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,566
Dale, wait a minute.

382
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:37,855
It's okay, boys. Come on.

383
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,549
How you doing?

384
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:01,124
You okay?

385
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,301
-I said, "You okay?"
-I'm doing okay.

386
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:04,710
That's good.

387
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:06,472
I'm Chief Dixon.

388
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:08,927
I'm fixing to do what?

389
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:10,389
I'm Chief Dixon.

390
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,018
I'm fixing to feed the chickens
before it gets too damn hot.

391
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:21,736
Have you heard from your nephew lately?

392
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:23,986
Have you heard from Ray Malcolm?

393
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:26,945
He's my brother's boy.
I heard of my own kin.

394
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:30,742
Has he talked to you lately?
When was the last time you talked to him?

395
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:32,948
-Talked to who?
-Ray Malcolm.

396
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,164
Ray is my brother's boy.

397
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:39,622
I got to finish feeding these chickens.
It gets hot around here at noontime.

398
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:44,295
I hope you and them chickens
have a goddamn heatstroke.

399
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:07,364
Can I help you boys?

400
00:36:24,507 --> 00:36:27,294
"I'm fixing to feed these chickens."

401
00:36:27,843 --> 00:36:31,972
I say, "Have you heard from Ray Malcolm?"
Put that on Daddy's plate, sweetheart.

402
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,805
He says, "Ray Malcolm is my nephew.

403
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:38,972
"My brother's boy.
I guess I heard of my own kin."

404
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,805
So I said, "Have you spoken to him?"
He said, "Who?"

405
00:36:43,944 --> 00:36:47,146
I said, "Ray Malcolm."
He said, "Ray's my brother's boy."

406
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:50,400
Imagine the conversation
when Ray shows up.

407
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,321
Rolls?

408
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:55,578
Is this great or what?

409
00:36:55,704 --> 00:36:57,696
This is great, Cheryl Ann.

410
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:04,076
There you go.

411
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:08,837
I hope he does show up.
'Cause I got news for you.

412
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:11,755
That white trash and
those two niggers are in for--

413
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:15,346
Cheryl Ann, you nearly broke my--

414
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:22,141
Bonnie, pass me the pickles.

415
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,561
I never got any beans. May I have some?

416
00:37:42,207 --> 00:37:45,162
Did you think I was going to cut you?

417
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:49,548
I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world.

418
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:01,469
I'm glad you didn't kill that man
in the car lot.

419
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:05,853
What do you think we are?

420
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:30,537
That don't mean nothing, Dale.

421
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:35,878
What concerns me is that we left ourselves
so goddamn exposed.

422
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:37,926
So out there.

423
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:40,634
Anybody could tell
the man wasn't involved.

424
00:38:40,763 --> 00:38:45,591
You can't assume anything about anybody.
That's the guy who will fuck you.

425
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:49,352
Shit. I've been police chief here for...

426
00:38:50,397 --> 00:38:53,434
...hell, going on six years.

427
00:38:54,694 --> 00:38:56,900
I've never even had to draw my gun.

428
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:12,330
Come kiss your favourite mommy.

429
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:15,170
Get in the bed.

430
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:17,589
Get in there.

431
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,374
-See you in the morning.
-Goodnight, Mommy.

432
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,528
Enjoying yourself?
Getting enough to eat and drink?

433
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:49,286
Just about.

434
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,531
Isn't that your second bottle?

435
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:54,824
Yes, it is.

436
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:58,964
I want to apologise
for that last comment before.

437
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,208
I bet John feels terrible.

438
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:05,093
Dale didn't mean it.
He just grew up talking that way.

439
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:07,054
I understand.

440
00:40:08,015 --> 00:40:09,639
I'm sure John does, too.

441
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:12,924
These people are dangerous, aren't they?

442
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,845
Yes, they are.

443
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,723
I've never seen Dale this excited before.

444
00:40:22,111 --> 00:40:25,895
This case is the biggest thing
that's ever happened to him.

445
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:31,490
He really likes you and John. I can tell.

446
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:35,159
I think he looks at you like you're heroes.

447
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:39,246
Well, we're far from that.

448
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:42,755
You might want to tell him that.

449
00:40:45,133 --> 00:40:47,625
I have a little girl who needs her daddy.

450
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,431
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV. I read non-fiction.

451
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,703
We better head back.

452
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:25,247
No, come on guys, the night is young.

453
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:27,915
-Who wants cookies?
-We all do.

454
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:32,887
-Very serious meal.
-They're in here.

455
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:36,254
-I got to go pee.
-Pee off the porch.

456
00:41:36,892 --> 00:41:38,221
Like shit.

457
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:46,692
You know, Dale...

458
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:50,443
...this case is our problem.

459
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:56,822
What I'm saying is,
you can be as involved or...

460
00:41:57,037 --> 00:42:01,165
...uninvolved in the apprehension
of these guys as we want.

461
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:04,286
Assuming they show up.

462
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:06,661
If they do, I'll be there.

463
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,550
You got a nice spot here.

464
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:21,135
Nice house, nice family.

465
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,978
You're a lucky guy.

466
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,556
I guess I am a lucky guy at that.

467
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:31,185
I hardly ever lose a coin toss.

468
00:42:34,531 --> 00:42:38,114
I go to the horse races,
bet a long shot and it always comes in.

469
00:42:39,035 --> 00:42:41,906
My mama used to say
I was born under a lucky star.

470
00:42:57,886 --> 00:43:01,136
Here's an article about Julia
from Dark Memories.

471
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:05,638
That ain't Julia.
That's that damn twin sister.

472
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:08,594
No, it's not.

473
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:11,013
Ma'am, can you tell him who this is?

474
00:43:11,316 --> 00:43:13,475
That's Julia on Dark Memories.

475
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:17,226
I told you. You got any maps of Houston?

476
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,779
We don't need no map of Houston.

477
00:43:58,487 --> 00:43:59,897
Be cool.

478
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:04,068
How are you, Bill?

479
00:44:04,451 --> 00:44:06,443
It's real quiet out there.

480
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,745
I think we got
the two most exciting jobs in town.

481
00:44:13,626 --> 00:44:15,499
Your other burrito is ready.

482
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:19,543
He's watching me. He knows who I am.

483
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:22,457
-No, he doesn't.
-He does.

484
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:25,006
Baby, let's go.

485
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,426
Back up. Just back up.

486
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,759
Ray, stop it. Stop it.

487
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:33,927
Shit.

488
00:44:45,074 --> 00:44:46,947
I'd never get up on a horse.

489
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,489
-Get your hand off me.
-Let's go.

490
00:44:53,582 --> 00:44:54,781
Let's go, okay?

491
00:44:55,417 --> 00:44:56,876
Don't fuck up, man.

492
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:17,638
-Will that be all?
-That's it.

493
00:45:17,897 --> 00:45:20,139
Hope you don't mind
that we opened things up.

494
00:45:20,274 --> 00:45:22,018
As long as you pay for it.

495
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:26,649
You going to drink that beer and drive?

496
00:45:26,947 --> 00:45:29,486
No, we wouldn't do that. This is for later.

497
00:45:31,118 --> 00:45:32,447
Just kidding.

498
00:45:33,078 --> 00:45:34,573
$7.95, please.

499
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:55,471
-Have a nice night.
-You, too.

500
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,684
She's too young for you, Bill.

501
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,063
I like them young.

502
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:28,878
Shit! That trooper is behind us.

503
00:46:30,175 --> 00:46:31,373
Don't look back.

504
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:32,789
Just be cool.

505
00:46:33,344 --> 00:46:35,053
What if he pulls us over?

506
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,674
He won't.

507
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:48,100
Slow down, Ray. Don't panic.

508
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:51,110
He recognised me back there. I know it.

509
00:46:51,236 --> 00:46:53,989
If he had, he would have arrested you
in the store.

510
00:46:54,656 --> 00:46:56,400
He's just looking us over.

511
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,649
A white boy and a nigger girl in Texas.
That's all it is.

512
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:04,037
He's probably running our plates.

513
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,577
542.

514
00:47:07,169 --> 00:47:08,543
Go ahead.

515
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:14,461
On your out-of-state plate, New Mexico
licence number Nora-Edward-2-4-5...

516
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:17,085
...the vehicle is recently purchased.

517
00:47:17,387 --> 00:47:21,136
There are no warrants.
No current registration available.

518
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:25,638
10-4. Could you check the teletype board
for the past few days?

519
00:47:26,561 --> 00:47:29,932
I seem to recall a teletype from California...

520
00:47:30,149 --> 00:47:32,901
...of a male and female black...

521
00:47:33,027 --> 00:47:36,111
...and a male white,
wanted for a couple of murders.

522
00:47:37,615 --> 00:47:40,367
Speed up, Ray.
You'll make him suspicious.

523
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:43,286
Speed up, slow down.
Make up your fucking mind.

524
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:46,496
Did you find that teletype?

525
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:48,951
Still looking, 542.

526
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:51,116
10-4.

527
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:00,924
542.

528
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:03,798
I'm going to pull them over.

529
00:48:06,268 --> 00:48:07,263
Fuck!

530
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:08,592
What do we do?

531
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:12,564
-I'll blow his goddamn head off.
-Pull over.

532
00:48:13,274 --> 00:48:17,272
We're going to be cool and play it by ear.

533
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,940
We won't kill him unless we have to.

534
00:48:21,657 --> 00:48:24,445
We're not going to be stupid.

535
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:15,205
Could I see your licence and registration?

536
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:16,960
Hi, it's you again.

537
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:38,188
You have a California licence
and New Mexico plates and registration.

538
00:49:39,024 --> 00:49:40,733
We had California plates...

539
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,145
...but our car broke down in New Mexico
and we got a new one.

540
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:46,730
Told you we wouldn't make it.

541
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:49,073
He wouldn't listen to me.

542
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:51,029
This one will make it.

543
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:52,359
Make it where?

544
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:56,244
Philadelphia. My mother lives there.
She's sick.

545
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,541
Ray's my boyfriend,
so he got the job of taking me there.

546
00:50:00,377 --> 00:50:04,127
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.

547
00:50:06,258 --> 00:50:08,215
Were we speeding or something?

548
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:09,416
No, ma'am.

549
00:50:09,637 --> 00:50:12,009
Then why the fuck did you pull us over?

550
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:17,894
I want you to get out of the car,
one at a time.

551
00:50:18,896 --> 00:50:20,270
You first, ma'am.

552
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,769
Get your hands up!

553
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,352
Calm down. You said, "Get out.
You first, man," right?

554
00:50:27,821 --> 00:50:31,154
Step to the rear of the car
and keep your hands visible.

555
00:50:34,828 --> 00:50:37,532
You said, "Get out of the car,"
that's all I'm doing.

556
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:39,992
What's wrong with you?

557
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:41,572
Do what he says.

558
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:45,160
Stay where you are, ma'am.
Put your hands on the car.

559
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:47,667
Spread them out.

560
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:49,549
Now spread your legs.

561
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:54,338
Same thing, hands on the car.

562
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,265
Spread your legs.

563
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,176
Okay, ma'am, come back here.

564
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:04,392
-Why don't you tell us what we did--
-Keep your hands on the car!

565
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:11,267
Okay, ma'am--

566
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:17,365
Goddamn! Yes, baby! Yes!
You motherfucker!

567
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:21,028
Let's go! Get her in the car.
Come on! Now!

568
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:22,913
You motherfucker!

569
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:43,138
Pluto, we're going the wrong way.
We're going back to town. Turn around.

570
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:46,472
-Ray, did I kill that man?
-Yes, but you did a good job.

571
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,766
What the fuck are you doing?
You're going the wrong way!

572
00:51:50,985 --> 00:51:55,563
The car's been identified.
We have to get rid of it.

573
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:58,526
Yes, you killed him, goddamn it.

574
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:02,908
Would you fucking turn the car around?
We're going the wrong way!

575
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:06,700
We'll pass the motherfuckers, got it?

576
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,210
-The cops will see us.
-We got no fucking choice.

577
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,413
If we head out of town, they'll catch us.
So shut up.

578
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,686
-How are you?
-I got a hangover, but--

579
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,941
Nothing here. Quiet as a Sunday morning.

580
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,529
When did you arrive?

581
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:42,071
I relieved Charlie around 4:00.
You want some coffee?

582
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,701
-No thanks.
-No.

583
00:52:45,286 --> 00:52:48,240
I was thinking about
what you said last night.

584
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:52,243
-No wonder you were pissed off.
-I wasn't.

585
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,957
No, you were right.

586
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,172
If that old man hadn't been deaf,
I could have blown the case.

587
00:52:58,299 --> 00:52:59,876
Well, I don't know.

588
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:04,256
No, I made a mistake.
You know more about this stuff than I do.

589
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,093
I don't want you thinking
we're incompetent.

590
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:11,182
Dale, you have the energy
and dedication of ten cops.

591
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:12,475
No shit?

592
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,276
Let me ask you something else.

593
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:23,690
If I'm full of shit, you just tell me.

594
00:53:24,074 --> 00:53:26,446
I want to move to L.A. and join up.

595
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,324
Join up with what?

596
00:53:28,454 --> 00:53:32,533
The police department. I've been
on the force here since I was grown.

597
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:37,246
After ten years of busting peeping Toms,
I'd like to take a crack at the big time.

598
00:53:38,922 --> 00:53:42,422
I realise getting on the force
is no walk in the park, but...

599
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:46,710
...once we wrap up this case
and with your recommendation...

600
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,389
...well, who knows?

601
00:53:50,517 --> 00:53:53,683
You, me and Macintosh
could make a great team.

602
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:56,843
That's an interesting idea.

603
00:53:57,898 --> 00:53:59,606
How you doing, Hurricane?

604
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:04,317
This is Larry Gibson, our local Smokey.

605
00:54:05,572 --> 00:54:08,490
Larry, this is Dud Cole. He's from L.A.

606
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:13,995
Last night, some folks killed
a Texas State Trooper.

607
00:54:14,457 --> 00:54:16,995
It says here they may
be headed for Houston.

608
00:54:17,918 --> 00:54:21,333
They may fit the description
of the folks you're after.

609
00:54:21,629 --> 00:54:23,040
Son of a bitch.

610
00:54:23,464 --> 00:54:26,797
We may even have a photograph of them
in a convenience store.

611
00:54:27,261 --> 00:54:29,253
-Surveillance camera?
-Yeah.

612
00:54:29,387 --> 00:54:30,383
Texas.

613
00:54:32,057 --> 00:54:34,511
Looks like they're headed our way, boys.

614
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:37,681
Got another cup?

615
00:54:38,063 --> 00:54:40,350
-You don't mind drinking after me?
-Not at all.

616
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:41,762
Goddamn. Texas.

617
00:55:01,293 --> 00:55:04,044
Do you think our people
whacked that trooper?

618
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,961
We'll know when we see the photo.

619
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:14,387
Hurricane is waiting on the bad guys
the way a kid waits for Christmas.

620
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:17,550
Hurricane is a force of nature.

621
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:19,392
I like old Hurricane.

622
00:55:22,521 --> 00:55:24,100
He's a tremendous guy.

623
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:27,480
-You know what he told me this morning?
-What?

624
00:55:28,445 --> 00:55:31,196
He wants to come to L.A.
and join the force.

625
00:55:32,656 --> 00:55:34,696
-Are you kidding?
-Honest to God.

626
00:55:35,868 --> 00:55:41,454
He said he thought that me and him
and Macintosh would make a great team.

627
00:55:42,207 --> 00:55:43,202
No shit.

628
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:47,331
He said he wanted a crack at the big time.

629
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,255
What did you say?

630
00:55:51,342 --> 00:55:53,630
I told him it was an interesting idea.

631
00:55:56,388 --> 00:55:58,760
That's the funniest thing I ever heard.

632
00:56:00,892 --> 00:56:05,020
Can you imagine that motherfucker
roaming around Parker Centre?

633
00:56:08,149 --> 00:56:11,150
He'd "put a stopper in the bottle."

634
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:15,317
That yokel would last ten minutes.

635
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:19,823
"Put a stopper in the bottle."

636
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:26,333
Hurricane, you know
no one's allowed back there.

637
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,660
-Just getting a candy bar.
-You plan to pay for it this time?

638
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,800
I saw your car parked out front.

639
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,135
Charlie relieved me a half hour ago.

640
00:56:41,347 --> 00:56:44,597
Dud, I didn't mean to put you
on the spot this morning.

641
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,854
Dale, we didn't mean--

642
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:50,225
That's me.

643
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,441
This is 210.

644
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:55,521
Ijust got back from Little Rock
with thatpicture.

645
00:56:55,777 --> 00:56:58,185
10-4. That's us.

646
00:57:00,408 --> 00:57:01,605
You leave it.

647
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:20,090
Jimmy, you got it?

648
00:57:36,317 --> 00:57:37,432
That's Ray.

649
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:40,524
And so that must be
our mystery girl, Fantasia.

650
00:57:45,034 --> 00:57:46,694
Her name's not Fantasia.

651
00:57:49,747 --> 00:57:51,028
It's Lila Walker.

652
00:57:58,756 --> 00:57:59,954
Hey, Pluto.

653
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:01,669
What's happening?

654
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,342
How are you, Beaver?

655
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:06,292
They're cool.

656
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,758
Come on in.

657
00:58:16,856 --> 00:58:18,481
-Come on in.
-Go ahead.

658
00:58:25,657 --> 00:58:28,444
This is Fantasia. That's Ray.

659
00:58:30,286 --> 00:58:34,034
That's Joey.
And the whining one on the couch is Kim.

660
00:58:34,456 --> 00:58:37,624
-She had a couple teeth yanked out.
-Fuck you, Beaver.

661
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,540
Grab yourself a chair.

662
00:58:56,603 --> 00:58:57,931
You want to sit down?

663
00:58:58,063 --> 00:58:59,688
That's okay. I'm fine.

664
00:59:04,402 --> 00:59:06,525
So where's this multitude of coke?

665
00:59:07,322 --> 00:59:09,610
-Where's Billy?
-He ain't here.

666
00:59:11,493 --> 00:59:13,402
I can see that. Where is he?

667
00:59:14,037 --> 00:59:16,528
He's still in New Orleans.

668
00:59:17,832 --> 00:59:19,031
New Orleans?

669
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,963
When will he be here?

670
00:59:24,256 --> 00:59:25,500
Tomorrow night.

671
00:59:27,884 --> 00:59:30,172
He didn't tell me that when we spoke.

672
00:59:31,178 --> 00:59:32,969
He got hung up.

673
00:59:33,721 --> 00:59:36,807
He didn't know that would happen
when he spoke to you.

674
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,940
We'll wait for him.

675
00:59:46,192 --> 00:59:48,351
We can't wait. We have to go.

676
00:59:49,154 --> 00:59:50,897
We'll wait until tomorrow.

677
00:59:53,282 --> 00:59:54,610
We'll stay here.

678
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:57,615
I don't think that's such a good idea.

679
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:01,370
We don't have much room, and....

680
01:00:05,795 --> 01:00:08,083
Yeah, what the fuck, man.

681
01:00:10,091 --> 01:00:11,634
You can have my room.

682
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:14,133
I've slept on the couch before.

683
01:00:14,428 --> 01:00:17,797
Fuck you, Beaver. I'm not moving.

684
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:19,844
Give me the phone.

685
01:00:19,975 --> 01:00:23,309
Sometimes I think you haven't got
a brain in your head.

686
01:00:23,938 --> 01:00:28,683
I'm going to Star City.
The only reason I got involved in this shit...

687
01:00:28,942 --> 01:00:32,986
...is so we'd get some money
and I could go home and see my people.

688
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:35,986
That was before all this shit happened.

689
01:00:36,575 --> 01:00:38,863
Now it's about time we got
where we're going.

690
01:00:39,787 --> 01:00:41,364
So what's the problem?

691
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,288
All you have to do is
pick me up on the way.

692
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:50,370
You know that Pluto isn't going to do that.
You heard what the man said.

693
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:53,839
I think it's a good idea.

694
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,513
If she goes ahead of us,
it will be safer to travel.

695
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:07,098
We won't fit the description so easily.

696
01:01:09,606 --> 01:01:10,721
No problem.

697
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:32,911
Ain't that some shit.

698
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:40,212
Can you make it a whole day without me?

699
01:01:41,221 --> 01:01:42,679
I don't know.

700
01:01:46,143 --> 01:01:49,013
It looks like just her brother
and mama are there.

701
01:01:49,645 --> 01:01:51,353
What kind of people are they?

702
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,603
Good people. Christian people.

703
01:01:54,483 --> 01:01:57,152
I can't believe she got mixed up
in this shit.

704
01:01:58,196 --> 01:02:01,196
Hurricane, how is it
that you know this Lila Walker?

705
01:02:03,325 --> 01:02:05,531
I arrested her for shoplifting once.

706
01:02:06,245 --> 01:02:08,367
She was just a kid in high school.

707
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:12,574
All she took was lipstick
and that shit they put on their eyes.

708
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:14,369
Wasn't worth ten bucks.

709
01:02:14,879 --> 01:02:18,412
I could tell right off she wasn't bad,
just high-spirited.

710
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:23,385
So I decided to try to help her out.
You know, talk to her.

711
01:02:25,013 --> 01:02:27,171
Then one day, she just disappeared.

712
01:02:28,016 --> 01:02:29,344
Somebody said...

713
01:02:29,768 --> 01:02:32,803
...she took off for Hollywood
to become a movie star.

714
01:02:33,562 --> 01:02:36,563
Anyway, that was about five years ago.

715
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:39,480
I didn't hear of her again till now.

716
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:42,269
She's moved up from stealing lipstick.

717
01:02:42,696 --> 01:02:44,819
I don't believe she killed anyone.

718
01:02:45,617 --> 01:02:49,744
That kid in the closet. She opens the door,
sees him, closes the door.

719
01:02:51,664 --> 01:02:53,656
That proves she's not a killer.

720
01:02:54,249 --> 01:02:56,371
Hurricane, that don't prove shit.

721
01:02:58,087 --> 01:03:00,708
So, do we talk to the mother?

722
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:03,832
-What if she tips off Lila?
-She won't.

723
01:03:05,176 --> 01:03:07,298
She wouldn't do that, not Lila.

724
01:03:08,012 --> 01:03:09,341
Have you heard from her?

725
01:03:09,473 --> 01:03:12,307
No, I haven't. Not since last summer.

726
01:03:12,808 --> 01:03:14,718
Some time around June or July.

727
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:20,223
Mr. Dixon, you know Lila. She wouldn't do
what they're saying she did.

728
01:03:21,234 --> 01:03:23,725
She must have been kidnapped.
Brainwashed.

729
01:03:26,406 --> 01:03:30,734
Some of the best policemen in this country
are after Lila and those fellows.

730
01:03:31,368 --> 01:03:32,993
They'll catch them, too.

731
01:03:34,996 --> 01:03:37,571
It will help Lila if she turns herself in.

732
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,542
Chief Dixon is right.

733
01:03:40,419 --> 01:03:45,080
We can't promise anything, but if
she cooperates, that will have weight later.

734
01:03:45,758 --> 01:03:49,885
I haven't heard from her, but if I do,
I'll tell her what you said.

735
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,844
Ronnie, have you heard from your sister?

736
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:57,472
No, sir.

737
01:03:58,353 --> 01:04:00,262
Would you tell us if you had?

738
01:04:01,398 --> 01:04:02,393
Yes, sir.

739
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:07,314
Grandma...

740
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:09,394
...l'm hungry.

741
01:04:10,573 --> 01:04:12,695
Byron, don't bother us now, honey.

742
01:04:13,784 --> 01:04:15,065
Who's that?

743
01:04:15,494 --> 01:04:16,988
That's Lila's boy.

744
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,617
Didn't you know Lila had a boy?

745
01:04:23,669 --> 01:04:25,626
And he's a pretty boy, too.

746
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,345
Thanks for your time.
That's all we need for now.

747
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:39,841
They're not going to Jeremiah's at all.

748
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:43,558
No. Fantasia's coming home
to see her kid.

749
01:04:43,854 --> 01:04:47,141
Hurricane, just how well
do you know this gal?

750
01:04:47,442 --> 01:04:48,818
What do you mean?

751
01:04:49,861 --> 01:04:51,059
You know what I mean.

752
01:04:51,195 --> 01:04:53,437
That's real fucking funny.

753
01:06:13,442 --> 01:06:14,437
Fuck!

754
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:20,102
Goddamn her.

755
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:50,650
Look at you. You've gone Hollywood.

756
01:07:50,785 --> 01:07:53,537
Look at you, all grown up.

757
01:07:54,497 --> 01:07:56,870
Stand back. Let me have a look at you.

758
01:07:57,709 --> 01:07:59,251
Yeah, you still ugly.

759
01:07:59,752 --> 01:08:01,828
I'm just playing. You look fine.

760
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:04,542
I'm feeling fine.

761
01:08:05,716 --> 01:08:08,254
I'm going to see my baby. I'm going home.

762
01:08:11,931 --> 01:08:14,469
You can't go home. The cops are after you.

763
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:19,219
-What did they say?
-Get in the car.

764
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:25,310
-I didn't do the things they said.
-I know that.

765
01:08:29,113 --> 01:08:31,487
Being on the run makes you look guilty.

766
01:08:31,991 --> 01:08:33,570
I already look guilty.

767
01:08:34,494 --> 01:08:37,282
Looking guilty is being guilty
for black people.

768
01:08:37,997 --> 01:08:41,033
You know that. I won't get a fair trial...

769
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,458
...and I won't go to prison.

770
01:08:44,171 --> 01:08:45,795
Chief Dixon said that--

771
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:49,630
-Dale Dixon?
-He's the one who came to the house.

772
01:08:51,386 --> 01:08:53,259
Didn't you used to know him?

773
01:08:54,973 --> 01:08:56,680
Yeah, I used to know him.

774
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:03,056
Ron, I didn't come all this way
not to see my baby.

775
01:09:05,565 --> 01:09:07,393
They'll be watching our house...

776
01:09:07,526 --> 01:09:11,358
...so you have to take me someplace
outside of town.

777
01:09:12,156 --> 01:09:14,728
Then tonight you bring my baby
out to see me.

778
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:16,950
Then tomorrow I'll be gone.

779
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,037
Ronnie, please.

780
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,280
I'm your sister. I need your help.

781
01:09:28,712 --> 01:09:29,957
Okay, Lila.

782
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,510
A friend of mine's grandma died
a couple of months ago.

783
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:42,974
She had a house off the highway
past the bait shop.

784
01:09:46,731 --> 01:09:48,557
No one's living there now.

785
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:56,741
I'll be out there all night, so don't wait up.

786
01:09:57,157 --> 01:09:59,482
Are Dud and John going to be with you?

787
01:10:00,035 --> 01:10:01,528
No, they're not.

788
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:05,199
We don't need 19 goddamn people
to watch a house.

789
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:07,159
I know you're capable of--

790
01:10:07,292 --> 01:10:11,075
Just because I'm not from L.A.,
don't mean I can't watch a house.

791
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:16,212
Okay?

792
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:42,733
I love you. You know that, don't you?

793
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:45,025
I know that.

794
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:50,409
And I love our little girl
more than anything.

795
01:10:52,627 --> 01:10:53,956
I know that, too.

796
01:12:08,368 --> 01:12:11,867
I would give you every dime
we talked about if I had the money.

797
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,703
The problem is, I don't have it.

798
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:23,006
Your partner's making me nervous.
Sit your ass down, ponytail.

799
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,178
I know you guys are on the run.

800
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:36,975
You need everything you can get.
It's better than nothing, right?

801
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:47,311
Let's lighten up.
This town is hot, and so are you.

802
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:50,904
You're on every goddamn channel.

803
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:55,286
You got no one else you can trust but me.

804
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,698
I'm going to let you walk with one.

805
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,167
You can take it or leave it.

806
01:13:14,264 --> 01:13:15,258
Fucker.

807
01:13:18,101 --> 01:13:20,473
Eight fucking dollars. Who cares?

808
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:36,105
He has to have more money than that.

809
01:13:36,327 --> 01:13:37,358
Let's go.

810
01:13:40,623 --> 01:13:43,113
Pull over. We're splitting up.

811
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:45,167
What are you talking about?

812
01:13:45,294 --> 01:13:47,666
Pull over. Everything's fucked up.

813
01:13:47,879 --> 01:13:51,379
We'll split the money and the coke,
then I'm gone.

814
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:53,377
I ain't doing that.

815
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:56,175
Don't fuck with me.
Just give me my money.

816
01:13:56,638 --> 01:13:59,556
I can't do that. I don't have any money.

817
01:14:00,225 --> 01:14:01,256
Say what?

818
01:14:01,559 --> 01:14:03,350
I don't have any money.

819
01:14:05,272 --> 01:14:06,813
Where's my money?

820
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:10,190
I ain't got it. She took the fucking money.

821
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:14,233
I got $56. She took it.
Now let go before I have a wreck.

822
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:17,775
You're a pussy-whipped fucker.

823
01:14:17,909 --> 01:14:22,037
Don't give me that shit. It was your
fucking buddies who had no money.

824
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:24,281
Your good friend, Billy.

825
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:29,294
What the fuck am I doing with you?
You're a pussy-whipped motherfucker!

826
01:14:32,256 --> 01:14:35,340
If you want any money,
you'll have to go to Arkansas.

827
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:39,839
Lila, we got to go.

828
01:14:40,472 --> 01:14:42,381
Just give me a few minutes with him.

829
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:44,555
It's almost 4:00 in the morning.

830
01:14:47,187 --> 01:14:51,184
It's time for you to go home, go to bed
and get up and see your grandma.

831
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:55,150
I love you, honey. Will you be a good boy?

832
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:57,939
Give me a kiss good-bye.

833
01:14:58,197 --> 01:14:59,692
Come on, Lila.

834
01:15:04,036 --> 01:15:06,160
Take care of my baby, okay?

835
01:15:06,748 --> 01:15:08,325
Will you be all right?

836
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,879
Ronnie, put the money in the bank, okay?

837
01:15:16,465 --> 01:15:20,083
Ronnie, put the money in the bank, okay?

838
01:16:29,286 --> 01:16:31,409
-How you doing?
-Stop right there.

839
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,872
Turn around.
Put your hands on the counter.

840
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:36,874
Spread your legs.

841
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,042
Simon says.

842
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:46,212
Can I turn around now?

843
01:16:46,344 --> 01:16:47,837
Just stay like that.

844
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:07,397
Where are your two pals?

845
01:17:08,281 --> 01:17:09,444
Ray and Pluto?

846
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,368
They'll be here soon.

847
01:17:14,411 --> 01:17:15,789
How soon is that?

848
01:17:16,372 --> 01:17:17,571
I don't know.

849
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:19,993
They have to call first.

850
01:17:22,879 --> 01:17:28,170
How do I know you're not lying?
They might show up here any minute.

851
01:17:30,553 --> 01:17:32,344
I'm not lying to you, Dale.

852
01:17:36,058 --> 01:17:37,766
What will you do with me?

853
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:43,643
Get in the other room. Go on.

854
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:53,859
Go into the living room.

855
01:17:57,495 --> 01:17:59,119
-What are you doing?
-Sit down.

856
01:17:59,246 --> 01:18:00,444
What are you doing?

857
01:18:00,582 --> 01:18:02,954
Two fellows from L.A. want to meet you.

858
01:18:03,251 --> 01:18:05,659
-Put the phone down.
-Why?

859
01:18:06,004 --> 01:18:09,538
Ray and Pluto will call here
to see if everything is cool.

860
01:18:10,174 --> 01:18:13,293
I won't answer the phone
if you call those cops.

861
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:14,749
Yes, you are.

862
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,725
Goddamn it!

863
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:27,435
Lila, even if I wanted to, I can't help you.

864
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,443
I don't have the legal authority.

865
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:37,156
You didn't have the authority
to fuck me when I was 17...

866
01:18:37,283 --> 01:18:39,242
...but that didn't stop you.

867
01:18:44,082 --> 01:18:45,280
That's right.

868
01:18:46,585 --> 01:18:51,247
Instead of spying on me, why didn't
you come in and say hello to your son?

869
01:18:51,632 --> 01:18:52,960
He's not my kid.

870
01:18:53,508 --> 01:18:57,091
Not your kid?
He's nearly as white as you are.

871
01:18:57,429 --> 01:18:58,626
That proves nothing.

872
01:18:58,763 --> 01:19:00,554
Are you calling me a whore?

873
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:13,019
I was a virgin when we met
and you know it.

874
01:19:23,286 --> 01:19:24,864
Hear the whippoorwill?

875
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:30,291
Remember what you said
about hearing a whippoorwill?

876
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,920
It means someone's going to die.

877
01:19:52,733 --> 01:19:55,104
Why do we have to sit here in the dark?

878
01:19:55,401 --> 01:19:58,271
I don't want to be a sitting duck
if they show up.

879
01:19:58,696 --> 01:20:01,483
I told you,
they won't be here until they call.

880
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,738
Where you going?

881
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:07,275
-My cigarettes are in my purse.
-Get one of mine.

882
01:20:07,412 --> 01:20:10,164
-I smoke menthol.
-I'll get them.

883
01:20:22,344 --> 01:20:24,669
I forgot that thing was even in there.

884
01:20:26,765 --> 01:20:28,887
Ray gave it to me for protection.

885
01:20:30,226 --> 01:20:33,678
-I don't even know how it works.
-You pull the damn trigger.

886
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:38,773
Why are you looking at me like that?

887
01:20:40,486 --> 01:20:43,155
Did you think I would shoot you?
That's crazy.

888
01:20:44,364 --> 01:20:46,654
Now can I have my cigarettes, please?

889
01:20:58,128 --> 01:20:59,788
You have a light, baby?

890
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:19,680
Does your wife treat you right?

891
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:21,608
Yes, Lila, she does.

892
01:21:22,443 --> 01:21:23,606
That's good.

893
01:21:26,323 --> 01:21:28,730
What's her name again? Thelma Lou?

894
01:21:34,579 --> 01:21:35,742
Cheryl Ann.

895
01:21:37,124 --> 01:21:38,322
That's right.

896
01:21:39,376 --> 01:21:41,913
And you and Cheryl Ann have a little girl.

897
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,708
What's her name?

898
01:21:45,382 --> 01:21:46,377
Bonnie.

899
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:48,920
How old is she?

900
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:51,133
Eight.

901
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:56,350
You don't like telling me
about your family, do you?

902
01:21:56,476 --> 01:21:57,935
No, I guess I don't.

903
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:01,182
I don't blame you.

904
01:22:04,902 --> 01:22:07,108
-I got something for you.
-Where are you going?

905
01:22:07,236 --> 01:22:08,861
Don't shoot me, officer.

906
01:22:09,655 --> 01:22:11,694
What the hell are you doing now?

907
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:14,192
-Can I turn on the light?
-No.

908
01:22:18,413 --> 01:22:20,537
I put it in here to keep it fresh.

909
01:22:21,292 --> 01:22:23,782
Can we leave this open to get some light?

910
01:22:25,338 --> 01:22:27,579
This is our baby's birthday cake.

911
01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:36,931
I don't want any.

912
01:22:38,684 --> 01:22:40,094
Suit yourself.

913
01:22:44,564 --> 01:22:45,678
It's good.

914
01:22:46,941 --> 01:22:48,435
You should try some.

915
01:22:49,653 --> 01:22:51,194
Today's his birthday?

916
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:54,528
No. It was in September.

917
01:22:55,867 --> 01:22:57,029
I missed it.

918
01:22:57,702 --> 01:23:00,786
I left him with Mama
before he was two years old.

919
01:23:01,832 --> 01:23:04,286
That means I've missed four birthdays...

920
01:23:04,584 --> 01:23:07,252
...so we celebrated all four of them
last night.

921
01:23:10,422 --> 01:23:12,212
Does your mama know about....

922
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,421
Know what?

923
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:17,879
No, I never told her.
I never meant you any trouble, Dale.

924
01:23:19,432 --> 01:23:20,629
I still don't.

925
01:23:22,266 --> 01:23:26,431
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know
she had a half-brother in Nigger Town?

926
01:23:30,775 --> 01:23:33,445
You should have some of our baby's cake--

927
01:23:33,653 --> 01:23:35,277
Quit calling him that.

928
01:23:35,655 --> 01:23:37,316
Why? That's what he is.

929
01:23:38,825 --> 01:23:41,150
Damn it, I told you I didn't want any.

930
01:23:43,663 --> 01:23:45,702
-Do you want this?
-What are you doing?

931
01:23:45,831 --> 01:23:47,990
-This is what you want.
-Cut it out.

932
01:23:50,211 --> 01:23:52,417
Cut it out, goddamn it!

933
01:23:58,469 --> 01:24:00,425
Why did you ever fuck with me?

934
01:24:04,766 --> 01:24:07,932
Me and my brother's daddy was white,
did you know that?

935
01:24:10,896 --> 01:24:12,807
Of course, we never knew him.

936
01:24:13,817 --> 01:24:15,394
He had another family.

937
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:20,069
That's why I kind of look white.

938
01:24:20,657 --> 01:24:22,448
Because my daddy was white.

939
01:24:23,451 --> 01:24:27,496
You figured since I kind of look white,
you could fuck me, what the hell.

940
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:32,373
Because I was kind of black...

941
01:24:32,793 --> 01:24:35,000
...you could dump me, what the hell.

942
01:25:14,126 --> 01:25:15,240
211 to 210.

943
01:25:18,087 --> 01:25:19,202
211 to 210.

944
01:25:21,089 --> 01:25:22,204
211 to 210.

945
01:25:24,135 --> 01:25:25,795
Dale, where are you at?

946
01:25:34,478 --> 01:25:35,557
Hey, June.

947
01:25:36,105 --> 01:25:38,477
Juney! How are you doing?

948
01:25:40,818 --> 01:25:42,525
You got something for me?

949
01:25:44,362 --> 01:25:45,690
Hi, Mr. Charlie.

950
01:26:38,915 --> 01:26:42,332
Is this Ronnie? Ronnie, this is Ray.
Is Fantasia there?

951
01:26:43,586 --> 01:26:44,700
Yeah, Lila.

952
01:26:45,713 --> 01:26:46,910
Where is she?

953
01:26:51,094 --> 01:26:53,549
Have you got a number out there for her?

954
01:26:56,641 --> 01:26:58,348
Give it to me, all right?

955
01:27:06,025 --> 01:27:08,313
Ronnie! Ronnie, come here.

956
01:27:09,527 --> 01:27:11,187
-Come here.
-I got to go.

957
01:27:18,369 --> 01:27:22,284
If you know something about
Lila being here, you tell these gentlemen.

958
01:27:22,415 --> 01:27:24,990
I don't want you being in trouble.

959
01:27:25,127 --> 01:27:27,997
No, ma'am.
I don't know nothing about that.

960
01:27:29,882 --> 01:27:33,297
June Hawkins told me
he was out last night digging frogs.

961
01:27:34,343 --> 01:27:38,293
Driving back, he saw you driving
in front of him with Byron in the car.

962
01:27:39,682 --> 01:27:42,007
Where had you and Byron been
at 4:00 a.m.?

963
01:27:42,643 --> 01:27:44,386
We've been here all night.

964
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,687
June's mixed up. He's old.
He don't see so well.

965
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:52,023
-I'll make the bastard talk!
-He won't talk. It's his sister.

966
01:27:54,906 --> 01:27:56,565
Can I speak to the boy?

967
01:27:59,451 --> 01:28:01,443
-How are you this morning?
-Fine.

968
01:28:01,829 --> 01:28:03,620
-Pretty sleepy?
-I guess so.

969
01:28:04,372 --> 01:28:07,326
-You go out with Uncle Ronnie last night?
-No.

970
01:28:07,584 --> 01:28:08,579
You sure?

971
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:11,166
-You didn't see a pretty lady?
-No.

972
01:28:11,756 --> 01:28:12,787
You sure?

973
01:28:13,549 --> 01:28:16,217
-Did Uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
-Yeah.

974
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,680
So this has just been pretend?

975
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:28,015
What do you say we stop playing pretend
and play really?

976
01:28:31,273 --> 01:28:33,562
And you really should spend a night in jail.

977
01:28:33,692 --> 01:28:35,566
So you can tell your sister.

978
01:28:52,043 --> 01:28:53,585
You got to let me go.

979
01:28:56,673 --> 01:28:58,251
I can't do that, Lila.

980
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:03,425
You can't let them put me in jail.

981
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:08,756
What's going to happen
to our baby with me in jail?

982
01:29:09,894 --> 01:29:12,220
Your mom will keep taking care of him.

983
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:17,856
I'll give her money for him.

984
01:29:19,028 --> 01:29:21,150
Why won't you give him the money?

985
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:27,527
Why don't you just say,
"Byron, I'm your daddy"?

986
01:29:35,127 --> 01:29:37,084
I don't see how that would....

987
01:29:41,591 --> 01:29:44,047
I guess it wouldn't be a good idea.

988
01:29:47,097 --> 01:29:50,596
I guess it would be better
just to put me in jail...

989
01:29:51,726 --> 01:29:54,299
...and forget about your five-year-old son.

990
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:20,492
Hi, baby.

991
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,499
Yeah, everything's cool.

992
01:30:25,552 --> 01:30:27,211
Everything's real cool.

993
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:30,884
Ray, where are you calling from?

994
01:30:34,142 --> 01:30:36,301
What's the name of the gas station?

995
01:30:39,939 --> 01:30:41,813
Ray, you missed the turnoff.

996
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,902
It's about half a mile back up the highway.

997
01:30:49,031 --> 01:30:52,816
You turn right at this place
called Cothern's Bait Shop.

998
01:30:54,662 --> 01:30:56,535
There's a little road there.

999
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:02,912
You're not far, baby.
Just about ten minutes away. Hurry.

1000
01:31:06,089 --> 01:31:07,465
Yeah, I miss you.

1001
01:31:35,993 --> 01:31:37,653
Is that the road, Byron?

1002
01:31:39,664 --> 01:31:42,415
-I don't think so.
-You don't think so?

1003
01:31:47,046 --> 01:31:50,996
When they arrive, get them in the house
and away from the car.

1004
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:55,291
Open the door, talk to them.
Let them see everything is okay.

1005
01:31:56,055 --> 01:31:58,889
Then stay in the kitchen
until I say to come out.

1006
01:31:59,558 --> 01:32:03,685
Then if they get trigger-happy,
you'll be out of the line of fire.

1007
01:32:06,606 --> 01:32:08,183
Then you'll let me go?

1008
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:16,979
I'll let you go.

1009
01:32:31,047 --> 01:32:33,039
Is that the road you took?

1010
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:55,019
Don't go in there fucking around.
In and out. You got me?

1011
01:32:55,153 --> 01:32:57,478
What do you think I'd do? Don't worry.

1012
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:15,751
You sure this is it?

1013
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:18,837
Yeah.

1014
01:35:13,244 --> 01:35:15,533
You got it straight?

1015
01:35:27,717 --> 01:35:28,748
Hi, baby.

1016
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:33,262
Come on, Fantasia, let's go.

1017
01:35:33,389 --> 01:35:36,176
It'll be a few minutes.
I have to pack my stuff.

1018
01:35:37,685 --> 01:35:40,555
What stuff? All you had was your purse.

1019
01:35:41,021 --> 01:35:42,978
It won't be long. Come on in.

1020
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:44,186
Shit!

1021
01:35:45,568 --> 01:35:46,731
I'll be back.

1022
01:35:46,861 --> 01:35:50,229
That's bullshit. I'm sticking on your ass.

1023
01:35:56,537 --> 01:35:58,909
She better not have bought any clothes.

1024
01:36:00,833 --> 01:36:02,624
What does she have to pack?

1025
01:36:02,918 --> 01:36:04,661
-Come on.
-Be careful. I love you.

1026
01:36:04,794 --> 01:36:06,916
Did you spend any of my money?

1027
01:36:10,842 --> 01:36:14,376
Fantasia? Where did she go?

1028
01:36:14,554 --> 01:36:19,014
Police officers, freeze!
Hands up or I'll blow you to fucking hell!

1029
01:36:19,225 --> 01:36:22,595
-What the fuck?
-Get on the floor! Now!

1030
01:36:22,729 --> 01:36:24,271
Who the fuck are you?

1031
01:36:25,063 --> 01:36:26,937
-You bitch!
-Shut up! Shut up!

1032
01:36:27,066 --> 01:36:29,817
-Why the fuck did you do this?
-I'm sorry.

1033
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:31,189
Stay back!

1034
01:38:19,633 --> 01:38:20,629
210.

1035
01:38:23,387 --> 01:38:27,764
210, A-1 channel 1. Come in, goddamn it.
Hurry up.

1036
01:38:28,099 --> 01:38:30,554
Hurricane, where the hell have you been?

1037
01:38:31,228 --> 01:38:32,888
I need help out here.

1038
01:38:33,314 --> 01:38:34,723
What's your 10-20?

1039
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:36,722
Oh, God.

1040
01:38:36,982 --> 01:38:39,474
Dale, what's your 20? Where are you?

1041
01:38:39,777 --> 01:38:44,440
I'm off the highway,
two miles down Sulphur Springs road.

1042
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:49,493
There's a house.
In the woods, there's this house--

1043
01:38:49,954 --> 01:38:51,448
Is there an address?

1044
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:56,823
I don't know the goddamn address.
Just send some help. And an ambulance.

1045
01:38:57,587 --> 01:39:01,037
I got three suspects down
and I'm hurtpretty bad.

1046
01:39:01,299 --> 01:39:05,295
-Three suspects down.
-You know Sulphur Springs Road?

1047
01:39:06,386 --> 01:39:07,631
Hold on, Byron.

1048
01:39:29,158 --> 01:39:30,403
Charlie, do something.

1049
01:39:30,535 --> 01:39:33,904
Dud, come on! Charlie's taking care of it.
Come on!

1050
01:40:03,275 --> 01:40:05,313
That son of a bitch nailed them.

1051
01:40:17,955 --> 01:40:18,952
Hey, man.

1052
01:40:20,499 --> 01:40:24,960
The ambulance is on the way.
I'll get you some blankets, okay?

1053
01:40:40,393 --> 01:40:41,936
Are you dead, mister?

1054
01:40:42,729 --> 01:40:44,272
Are you dead, mister?

1055
01:40:48,527 --> 01:40:50,685
-No, not quite.
-Where's the lady at?

1056
01:40:52,071 --> 01:40:53,447
She's over there.

1057
01:40:53,823 --> 01:40:57,274
Don't go away. Come back.
Come stay with me.

1058
01:41:04,959 --> 01:41:08,126
-Stay here with me.
-How did you get blood on yourself?

1059
01:41:09,464 --> 01:41:10,839
I got in a fight.

1060
01:41:13,967 --> 01:41:16,423
What do you do with your keys?

1061
01:41:19,765 --> 01:41:21,841
I lock things up.

1062
01:41:23,101 --> 01:41:25,391
Come here. I can't see your face.

1063
01:41:26,771 --> 01:41:28,811
Come a little closer.

1064
01:41:32,153 --> 01:41:33,315
Your name...

1065
01:41:34,862 --> 01:41:36,025
...is Byron.

1066
01:41:39,033 --> 01:41:40,776
You're five years old.

1067
01:41:42,454 --> 01:41:43,652
Four or five?

1068
01:41:44,039 --> 01:41:45,034
Five.

1069
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,078
Just come sit with me.
