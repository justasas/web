<i>With you, I shall experience them.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,440
What's that noise?

13
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,740
Wow, that singer should definitely be fired.

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,090
How could a tone-deaf person...

15
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,910
That person...!

16
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,040
Is she someone you know?

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,840
What?  Surely, she can't be Korean.

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,390
That would be an embarrassment to our country.

19
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,500
It's true.  She's Korean.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,280
But she's a really cool person.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,250
How do you know her?

22
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,690
She's my life saver.

23
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,460
What?  But that's us!

24
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,060
Hello, how are you?

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,460
Hello. Welcome.

26
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,900
I'm very pleased to finally meet you.

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,260
Hello, how are you?

28
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,370
Hello, how are you?

29
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,620
You must be very pleased
to have such a handsome son.

30
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,540
I too was waiting for Jae Kyung.
I'm disappointed to not meet her.

31
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,610
Right now, she's probably
wandering around Macao by herself.

32
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,020
She's used to doing things her own way, so
even we've thrown up our hands in defeat.

33
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,390
I heard that she's an extraordinary girl.
I'm looking forward to meeting her more and more.

34
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,960
Please don't expect anything.

35
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,300
Madam President, everything is ready.

36
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,090
Then, we should go.

37
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,585
Shinhwa's long-term ambition until 2020 is

38
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,210
to build a 2nd Potain Resort town in Incheon, Korea.

39
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:27,150
The ultimate resort city in Asia with luxurious hotels,
entertainment venues, and all other amenities.

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,790
For this project,

41
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:38,900
we need the cooperation of JK Group, which has
successfully built resorts in Las Vegas, Macao and Dubai.

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,640
If we combine Shinhwa's power as Korea's premier conglomerate with JK Group's on-site knowledge and skills,

43
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,900
we can achieve this goal that much faster.

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,580
It will signal a new era for Korea.

45
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,080
Ah, I'm hungry.

46
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,310
Let's go eat.

47
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,110
OK.  Jan Di, just wait.

48
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,110
Because there's a killer restaurant here.

49
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,870
Let's go.

50
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,080
Welcome.

51
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,670
What's wrong?  There's no table?

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,080
Don't worry, buddy.

53
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,350
As soon as they hear Jun Pyo's name,
it will immediately be "OK".

54
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,680
Let's go someplace else.

55
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,650
Why?  You feel like you're in Venice,
so you're craving Italian food?

56
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,750
Ah, that's true.  There's a
killer Italian chef here too.

57
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,210
Come on, guys.

58
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,910
But there's plenty of...

59
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,980
[Connection in progress]

60
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,890
[Photo has arrived.
Attempt connection?]

61
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,450
We should make a toast.

62
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,310
To Shinhwa Group and JK Group,
cooperating as one.

63
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,470
- To cooperation!
- To cooperation.

64
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,450
Are you OK?

65
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,380
About what?

66
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,440
Coming here.

67
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,920
You don't regret it?

68
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,130
When will I ever come to a place like this again?

69
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,950
It was my dream to go backpacking alone.

70
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,950
So what's your plan?

71
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,170
I don't have anything planned.

72
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,110
Right now, just to see him
and say, "Have you been well?"

73
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,950
"Me, I've been well."

74
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,590
Well, greeting him like that would be nice.

75
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,430
Isn't it strange?

76
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,790
What is?

77
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,470
It seems like it was ages ago
since we were all together.

78
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,900
If Gu Jun Pyo acts like he doesn't know me,

79
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:20,550
I'll wonder if I just dreamt it on my own.

80
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,540
It's not a dream.

81
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,800
If it were, it wouldn't have been so difficult.

82
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,760
What?

83
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,600
After sending you here, I realized...

84
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,650
That I hadn't done anything.

85
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
By the time I came around,
you were already on the plane.

86
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,830
So, it's not a dream.

87
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,820
Because right now,

88
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,530
you're right in front of me.

89
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,840
Sleep well.

90
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:56,350
"J"

91
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,180
Ah...

92
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:38,310
Ah! O...OK.
OK! That's enough!

93
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,250
Ah, go. Stop already.

94
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,030
You, really... If you weren't
the chief manager, I'd fire you.

95
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,020
Keep standing.

96
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,610
At 10:00, there's an inspection at the construction site.

97
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,760
And at 11:00, you'll be taking
the jet to visit the Singapore branch.

98
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,570
At 5:00, you have a meeting with the Mayor of Macao.

99
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,120
Also...

100
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,960
"Also" - what more?

101
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,690
Why stop in the middle of a sentence?

102
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,960
If you could make some time
to meet your F4 friends...

103
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,320
I have no time.

104
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,530
But they've been waiting since yesterday.

105
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,610
Am I someone with time on my hands?

106
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,990
So should I disregard today's
schedule and hang out with them?

107
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,810
If that's okay, then I'll see them.
Should I?

108
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,680
No.

109
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,810
Geez! Who maintains grass* like this?!

110
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,410
<i>{\a6}(*In Korean, "Jan Di" means "grass")</i>

111
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,990
Seriously! Nothing's going right!

112
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,370
[Young Master Yi Jung]

113
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,960
Yes?  It is I.

114
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,880
What kind of mayor asks to meet
at a place like this?  Is he a former athlete?

115
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,100
I'm sorry.

116
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,230
No need for you to say "I'm sorry".

117
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,980
Hey yo!

118
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,010
How have you been?

119
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,620
It's been a while.

120
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,820
You guys came?

121
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,450
If we want to see the world's busiest man,
Shinhwa Group's heir, we have to come.

122
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,630
How else can we see you?

123
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Nice to see you.

124
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,990
Really?

125
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,590
Because you don't seem that pleased.

126
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,440
What's with you, when we're
meeting after all this time?


127
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,850
Oh, Geum Jan Di also came with us.

128
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,950
That's not right. Actually,
Geum Jan Di came first to see you.

129
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,250
You haven't seen her, have you?

130
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,190
Why would I see her?

131
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,560
What?

132
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,310
Girls like her don't mean anything to me now.

133
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,990
Gu Jun Pyo...

134
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,950
So your not contacting Geum Jan Di
even once... You did that deliberately?

135
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,450
Deliberately or not, I don't have
time to think about stuff like that.

136
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,720
"Stuff like that"?

137
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,760
Jun Pyo, you really mean that?

138
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,230
We meet after all this time and
all you can talk about is silly stuff like this?

139
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,760
And you call yourself a man?

140
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,900
Why?

141
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,240
You guys meet and break up with girls all the time.

142
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,370
I can't be like that a little?

143
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,570
Even if we date and break up 20 times,
we don't do it like you!

144
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,470
Hey, really...

145
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,980
Let me go!

146
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,890
You... When we tried to stop
you before, what did you say?

147
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,250
You said that a real man takes
responsibility from beginning to end!

148
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,590
And you believed it?

149
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,860
You guys, surely...

150
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,290
You didn't think that she and I would last, did you?

151
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,970
This bastard...

152
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,140
Whose fault is it that
Geum Jan Di can't swim anymore?!

153
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,560
Stand up.

154
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,760
Yi Jung, calm down.

155
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,990
Do I look like I can calm down?
Listen to what that bastard is saying!

156
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,770
You...

157
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,130
Did you start, not knowing that it would be like this?

158
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,240
Didn't I warn you?

159
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,280
I told you not to carelessly
lead her on, you cowardly jerk!

160
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,210
What's with you guys?

161
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,890
Did you stop being my friend and all rush
to be Geum Jan Di's knights in shining armor?

162
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,960
Gu Jun Pyo...

163
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,000
If you came as my friends,
then have fun and go.

164
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,220
But if you even think about mentioning her name,

165
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,260
then leave immediately.

166
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,440
Why have you changed so much?

167
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,380
700,000.

168
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,890
What?

169
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,170
Within the Shinhwa name,

170
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,660
the employees and their families
for whom I am responsible,

171
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,720
are just short of 700,000.

172
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,190
Try carrying 700,000 lives on your shoulders.

173
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,450
And see if it doesn't change you.

174
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,130
<i>An unbelievable challenge.
An unimaginable reality.</i>

175
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,210
<i>Asia's Venice.  Shinhwa stands for "the Legend".</i>

176
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,510
Jan Di!

177
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,190
 Is Jun Pyo doing w...

178
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,330
What? Is something the matter?

179
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,920
It's OK.

180
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,070
It's just that guy has become really strange.

181
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,170
- What...
- Geum Jan Di should know as well.

182
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,990
As you know, during this time, many things changed.

183
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,950
And the stress is nothing to joke about either.

184
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,850
He... won't see me?

185
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,420
You... How did...

186
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,120
You knew all along?

187
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,180
You don't have to worry so much.

188
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,480
Because whatever it is, I came
to hear it from Gu Jun Pyo himself.

189
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,410
I have to face it.

190
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,310
After all, you are Geum Jan Di!

191
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,200
The night air is sooo nice!

192
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,690
Hey! Do you remember?

193
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,660
- What?
- What we used to do when we were young.

194
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,770
Rock, paper, scissors!

195
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,510
Rock, paper, scissors!

196
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,930
Rock, paper, scissors!

197
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,480
Ji Hoo, you go that way.

198
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,210
Jan Di, you go that way,
and I'll go this way, okay? Go!

199
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,490
Ten.

200
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,610
Nine.

201
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,000
Eight.

202
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,910
Seven.

203
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,850
Six.

204
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,530
Five.

205
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,420
Four.

206
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,980
Three.

207
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,900
Two.

208
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,850
One!

209
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,900
OK, I'm coming for you!

210
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,920
As a friend, I need a favor.

211
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,310
Tell me.

212
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,520
Meet her just once.

213
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,380
Why should I do that?

214
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,190
Didn't I say that it's a favor, as a friend?

215
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,790
And if I ask why you're asking for that favor?

216
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,460
Because right now, that's
the only thing I can do for her.

217
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,220
I'll be going.

218
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,720
What's the matter?

219
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,560
I was just heading out to the airport.

220
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,830
I just wanted to say "goodbye" here.

221
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,860
Because before I left,
I wanted to tell you something.

222
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,140
After today, I'm not sure I can say these words.

223
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,980
I’m really glad that I got to know you.

224
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,720
I'll be back.

225
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,380
Oh, Sunbae...

226
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,930
Sorry to wake you.

227
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,720
What's the matter?

228
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,090
We need to go somewhere.

229
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,110
Right now, at this hour?

230
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,830
I've heard of gymnastics on a moonlit night,
but what's with the stroll at dawn?

231
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,730
We're here.

232
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,740
Huh?

233
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,740
From here, you need to go by yourself.

234
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,550
It should be on that bridge.

235
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm talking about the reason why you came here.

236
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,250
Uh, Sunba...

237
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,040
Hi.  I'm here.

238
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,930
Yeah.

239
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,750
What brings you all the way here?

240
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,120
I was really worried after I heard about your father.

241
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,570
Thanks.

242
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,340
But...

243
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,300
You came all the way here to say that?

244
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,940
Now, I guess you can feel better.

245
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,940
What?

246
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,260
As you can see, I'm doing fine.

247
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,480
As you know, I'm a busy person.

248
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,980
Now that you know, go.

249
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,920
Don't bother worrying about my well-being.

250
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,230
What?

251
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,790
Is there anything else left to say?

252
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,990
Do you really mean it?

253
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,300
What is it that you want?

254
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,830
Surely not...

255
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,520
"I'm sorry",

256
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,150
"Forgive me",

257
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,090
"I'll be back so wait for me".

258
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,200
What?  Were you expecting something like that?

259
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,990
Why are you being like this?

260
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,530
I’ve started to wake up to reality, that’s all.

261
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,620
I get it. I understand now.

262
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,970
Pretending to not see me,
and not wanting to see me...

263
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,110
You're saying that you really meant it.

264
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,620
So to you, I'm...

265
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,100
Like a stain I want to erase.

266
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,870
You're cruel, Gu Jun Pyo.

267
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,380
You're really cruel.

268
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
No.

269
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,380
I've always been this kind of person.

270
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,130
I just pretended that I wasn't.

271
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,080
I'm leaving. Take care.

272
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,210
Just worry about yourself.

273
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,950
Hey, pretty girl.
Are you okay?

274
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,490
Excuse me.

275
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,140
You are my special lucky lady,
because you're my first today.

276
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,970
Lucky lady?

277
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,920
Song... song.

278
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Could you sing me one?

279
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,290
No, no. It's my treat.

280
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:09,370
<i>With you, I will leave.
Con te partiro.</i>

281
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:16,900
<i>Countries I never
Paesi che non ho mai</i>

282
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,522
<i>saw and experienced with you,
veduto e vissuto con te,</i>

283
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,580
<i>Now, yes, I shall experience them.
adesso, si, li vivro.</i>

284
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:30,955
<i>With you, I will leave
Con te partiro</i>

285
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:35,950
[Gu Jun Pyo <3 Geum Jan Di
Our first night!]

286
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,160
Starting today, let it be known that 2nd year

287
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:57,260
Geum Jan Di in Class B is my girlfriend.

288
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,770
Can you see it?
My heart?

289
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,290
Let go!

290
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,620
Young Master.

291
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,870
You can leave us.

292
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,950
Are you satisfied now?

293
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,710
Is President Kang satisfied now
that everything's the way you want?

294
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,480
I don't know.

295
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,710
Merely hearing about the likes of that girl

296
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,560
doesn't make me happy.

297
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,690
She's not just "that kind of a girl".

298
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,710
I...

299
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,990
Your SON!

300
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,310
She's the first girl that your son has ever loved.

301
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,100
Alright.

302
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,710
So what are you going to do?

303
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,310
Do you want to throw everything
away and run to her side?

304
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,060
Shinhwa Group, its employees, your future.

305
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,380
Fine.

306
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,960
But what about your father?

307
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,690
Stop it.

308
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,352
Your father, who tried his best
until the end for this company,

309
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:02,490
something that you would
toss away without hesitation.

310
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,270
Are you planning on throwing him away too?

311
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,420
Stop it.

312
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,580
What shall I do with that girl, Jan Di?

313
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,550
Should I make it so she can't live anywhere in Korea?

314
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,570
Be quiet.

315
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,850
I told you TO STOP!

316
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,180
Don't mess with Jan Di.

317
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,400
If you break your promise,

318
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,680
I'll destroy everything.

319
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:19,370
Can this pretty lady buy an ice cream from me please?

320
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,490
I'm sorry, but my Chinese is not good...

321
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,410
What did you just say?

322
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,650
Uh, ugly girl, please buy some ice cream.

323
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,400
Do you really think you can
sell anything with that line?

324
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,170
But you’d still buy it, wouldn't you?

325
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,440
How much is it?

326
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,710
Today.

327
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
What?

328
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,220
Give me today as payment for the ice cream.

329
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,190
Jan Di must be doing well, right?

330
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,950
No news is good news.

331
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:45,130
She's probably busy having fun with Jun Pyo.

332
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,460
Kang San!

333
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,870
If your stomach hurts, go to the bathroom.
Don't squirm around like that.

334
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,490
- What's wrong?
- Kang San.

335
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,340
Kang San.

336
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,500
San.

337
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,080
Where does it hurt?

338
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,140
What's wrong with him?

339
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,210
Oh dear!

340
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,370
Get a grip on yourself!

341
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,550
Get him on my back.

342
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,650
Kang San.

343
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,120
You're eating well, right?

344
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,400
Yes.

345
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,435
You're also sleeping well?

346
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:16,821
Yes.

347
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,280
Hm, your blood pressure looks good.

348
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,840
Hannah.

349
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,730
Yes?

350
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,990
Should I give you a piece of candy?

351
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,950
Yes.

352
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,970
There you go.

353
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,600
You're so cute.
Let's shake hands.

354
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,520
You're so pretty.

355
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,530
Bye.

356
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:43,930
Yes.

357
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,710
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

358
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,180
- Excuse us!
- Doctor!

359
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,380
- Doctor!
- Over here!

360
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,720
Is anyone here?

361
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
- Please help us!
- Doctor!

362
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,190
Something's wrong with him.

363
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,270
Please look at him.

364
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,650
It's pretty.

365
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,200
It's time to go.

366
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,500
Let's go.

367
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,310
This is mine.

368
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,710
I got it first.

369
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,030
I had my eyes on it first.

370
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,640
Get your hands off of it.

371
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,270
I won't.

372
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:49,910
Let go.

373
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,710
Miss, I'm sorry.

374
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,380
I sincerely apologize, but could
you please give this one up?

375
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,250
Why?

376
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,890
Do you know her size?

377
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,420
Size?

378
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,130
Hey, try these on.

379
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,350
Hey, hey.

380
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,530
What are you doing?

381
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,700
Hey!

382
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,640
They fit perfectly.

383
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,435
Take them off.

384
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:31,510
I don't want to.

385
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:35,280
You're not taking them off?!

386
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,790
Come here.

387
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,400
Who is that guy?

388
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,850
Is he crazy?

389
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,620
Are you alright?

390
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,000
Why do you only show up now?

391
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,240
They had some business so they left first.

392
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,110
What should we do?

393
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,980
We should be leaving too.

394
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,790
Let's leave on the first plane tomorrow.

395
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,720
What is that girl doing right now?

396
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,490
Are you asking about Geum Jan Di?

397
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,780
Young Master Yi Jung and Woo Bin
left for Seoul this afternoon,

398
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,430
Young Master Ji Hoo and Geum Jan Di
are planning to leave tomorrow.

399
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,170
It seems like she finally learn to let go.

400
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,595
Where is Jun Pyo?

401
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:10,270
He's been in the conference room all night.

402
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,130
It looks like he has finally found his place as well.

403
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:49,970
Gu Jun Pyo.

404
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,190
Can you hear me?

405
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:01,210
I thought about you everyday,

406
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:08,460
but how come I only remember us
fighting and arguing with each other?

407
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,740
Isn't it odd?

408
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,740
Even though, there're only memories of us fighting,

409
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,560
yet whenever I think about you, I always smile.

410
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,500
Gu Jun Pyo.

411
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,770
You're doing fine, right?

412
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,860
When are you going to come back and fight with me?

413
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,580
Jun Pyo!

414
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,930
Let's go together.

415
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,250
Let's go together.

416
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,260
Have you seen this plane before?

417
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,490
Isn't it a beauty?

418
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,510
Look at it.

419
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,990
This is the propeller that spins.

420
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:07,080
In the future, you have to fly this.

421
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,650
Let's get in.

422
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,500
If this is a car, then this is the steering wheel.

423
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,160
This is the handle.
Aren't there a lot of buttons?

424
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:16,780
Yes.

425
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,080
When you learn how to fly a plane,
you must fly this one.

426
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,680
Who are you?

427
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,090
Gu Jun Pyo.

428
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,270
Jun Pyo is...

429
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,780
Dad's son of course!

430
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,230
What will you do when I’m not around?

431
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,410
What do you have to do?

432
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,610
I’ll take care of Mom, Noona, and Shinhwa Group.

433
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,750
Gu Jun Pyo.

434
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,880
Let's makes a man-to-man promise!

435
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,370
Yes, Sir!

436
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,380
Promise!

437
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,770
Hey! Ji Hoo!

438
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,660
Ji Hoo! Hey!

439
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,600
Min.

440
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,620
Ji Hoo!

441
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,670
What are you doing here?
When did you come here?

442
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,340
A couple of days ago.
Long time no see.

443
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,680
Why didn't you tell me that
you were coming here to Macao?

444
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,810
Did you know how much I missed you?

445
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,660
How long are you going to stay?

446
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,930
I'm on my way back.

447
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,420
You can't!

448
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,350
You can't.

449
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,700
We can't separate like this.

450
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,920
Ji Hoo, let's go to my house.

451
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,290
I can't. I have company.

452
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,400
Who?

453
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,040
She's not your girlfriend, is she?

454
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,780
If this lady gives her permission, will you stay?

455
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:34,130
I'm Ji Hoo's friend, from Juilliard's

456
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,450
Oh, you are?

457
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,990
Nice to meet you.

458
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,930
I'm sick right now.

459
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,760
It's really serious.

460
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,490
So please grant me this request.

461
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,140
Excuse me?

462
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:50,030
Let's go to my house.

463
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,580
Just for one day.

464
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,680
Uh, sure. Alright.

465
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,590
Let's go.

466
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:12,830
It's no big deal if we leave a day later, right?

467
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,230
It's really been a while.

468
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,320
Right?

469
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,020
Let's go.

470
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,260
Okay.

471
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,870
This looks really delicious.

472
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,620
I've prepared a sumptuous meal.

473
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,640
You even know how to use those words?

474
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,850
You speak Korean really well.

475
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,900
Ji Hoo is Korean.

476
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,180
Did you learn Korean because of Ji Hoo sunbae?

477
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,570
No!

478
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:31,650
This... is only for Ji Hoo's use.

479
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,370
This looks so delicious.

480
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,480
Let's enjoy our meal.

481
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,040
Ji Hoo, eat a lot.

482
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,150
Eat up.

483
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,330
That girl is not pretty.

484
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,340
She's short and flat-chested.

485
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:46,050
And she eats way too much.

486
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,980
What do you want to hear?

487
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:52,990
That girl... Ji Hoo's girlfriend?

488
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,720
What do you think?

489
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,890
Ji Hoo, that girl... you like her.

490
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:00,490
What?

491
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,690
Whenever you see her, you smile.

492
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,090
Like before.

493
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:08,900
Before?

494
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,530
Whenever Ji Hoo see Seo Hyun. Like that.

495
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,990
Find out Geum Jan Di's room number for me.

496
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:37,990
What?

497
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,300
She checked out?

498
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,800
Alright.

499
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:16,730
Young Master, it's time for us to leave
for the meeting with the president.

500
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,610
When did Ji Hoo leave?

501
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,720
He's still in Macao.

502
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,630
Really?

503
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,320
Didn't he check out?

504
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,120
I heard that he and Geum Jan Di
went to his friend's house.

505
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,430
Friend? Which friend?

506
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:46,490
Shall I find out for you?

507
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,000
No, it's fine.

516

Next time, I'm not bringing doughnuts
since it's affecting our filming schedule.

517
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,710
You need to take this off too.

518
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,170
It's hurting now!

519
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,460
Why is he pinching my face?

520
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,010
Call Jun Pyo. Jan Di's in danger.

521
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,630
Hold on.

522
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,420
Are you going to pick me up?

523
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,030
Food, food, food!

524
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,190
Cut.

525
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:17,860
Don't hesitate, just touch her lightly with your lips.

526
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,850
Why are you opening your mouth?

527
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:22,940
After that, you look at her.

528
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,100
Cut, okay.
