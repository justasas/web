1
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,241
Order. Quiet!

2
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,213
Order. Order.
There's too much noise in here.

3
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,807
- [Whispering]
- What? Never mind who's making the noise.

4
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,876
I want it quiet in here.

5
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:37,116
<i>And you down there</i>—
<i>stop that whispering!</i>

6
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,852
This is a court of law,
not a public library.

7
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,224
Oh, sorry, Your Honor.

8
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,786
Uh, are the parties present
in the matter...

9
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,855
of Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden?

10
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,032
<i>Mr. Nicholas Arden?</i>

11
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,098
- Present.
- I don't want to bother with this.

12
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,644
It looks too complicated.
Let it wait.

13
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,975
Wasn't I supposed to marry
some people?

14
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,709
- Where are they? Wasn't that for today?
- If Your Honor please—

15
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,047
Just be still.

16
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,179
Aren't you the party that was doing
all that whispering down there?

17
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,519
- Well—
- Just be quiet.

18
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,617
What do you mean, "the same fellow"?
This is a petition.

19
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,185
- Well, his wife is the one that—
- Oh, really?

20
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,254
Where does it say that?

21
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,662
Well, what do you know about that?

22
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,103
- Are you, uh, Nicholas Arden?
- Yes, Your Honor.

23
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,370
- I am, Your Honor.
- Aren't you represented by counsel?

24
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,776
I'm a member of the bar, Your Honor.
I'm presenting my own case.

25
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,337
Oh, trying to save yourself
a buck or two, huh?

26
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,249
Here. "Airplane crash
in Pacific Ocean."

27
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,119
Uh, yes, sir. My wife was aboard the plane
that was forced down in the storm.

28
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,123
It's been five years, Your Honor.

29
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,455
This is a petition
to have her declared legally dead.

30
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,155
Is that what it says in here?

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,358
- Sorry, sir.
- Not at all. It was very nice of you to tell me.

32
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,095
Now let's see what <i>I</i> can find.

33
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,070
"Ellen Wagstaff Arden.

34
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,538
Two infant children."

35
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,236
Oh, how tragic.

36
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,507
That's sad. Very sad.

37
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,947
Two little babies, and you let her
fly off to a watery grave?

38
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,008
Well, we both flew off, Your Honor.

39
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,077
Uh, I had business in Australia.

40
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:19,454
She'd had so much trouble with the children—
the teething and all— that I took her with me.

41
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,459
Yes, it says so here.

42
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,361
Let's see.
"En route from refueling stop...

43
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,797
forced down in rough seas."

44
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,030
<i>- [Jangling]</i>
- Let's see here. "Life raft."

45
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,503
Young woman...

46
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,067
<i>would you stop jangling those cowbells?</i>

47
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,170
You mean these, Your Honor?

48
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:45,149
If I hear one more jingle jangle,
I'll really get after you.

49
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,085
<i>There's such a thing</i>
<i>as contempt of court, you know.</i>

50
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,214
- Weren't you in the same life raft?
- Well, no, sir.

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,816
The women took the first rafts.
The men took what were left.

52
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,884
We were all separated
during a storm.

53
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,692
- It's all right here in the brief.
- Keep your hands out.

54
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,368
- [Groans]
- Is something wrong, Your Honor?

55
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,600
Yes, there's plenty wrong.
My arthritis is killing me.

56
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,905
And your jabbering isn't helping me
get out of here any faster.

57
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,741
- Now, just stick to the facts.
- They're in my brief.

58
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,077
Then stop interrupting
and let me read them!

59
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,709
Is there any proof of loss?

60
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,946
Uh, page seven, I believe.

61
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,682
I see.

62
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,725
Oh, that's page four, Your Honor.

63
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,285
I know it's page four.
It says "page four" right here.

64
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,766
Oh, yes. Here it is. It's page seven!

65
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,138
Any depositions?

66
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,265
Uh, they begin here on page—

67
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,602
Where'd you study law anyway?

68
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,443
- Harvard, sir.
- Yeah? Might have known.

69
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,449
A Yale man myself.

70
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,111
Well, let's see. "Husband"—

71
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,918
Your Honor will see that there is, uh,
no opposition to this petition.

72
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,981
And all survivors agreed that, uh—

73
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,028
- "Said Ellen Wagstaff Arden
had been swept overboard—
- Swept overboard...

74
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,030
[Both]
"Before aid could reach her.

75
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,032
- Deposition appended."
- Quiet!

76
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,591
- Well, I'd like to explain, sir.
- There's nothing to explain.

77
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,899
Testimony is here. Sworn affidavits.

78
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,962
No evidence to the contrary.

79
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,974
The law is clear.

80
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,910
I hereby pronounce
Ellen Wagstaff Arden legally dead.

81
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,106
Wasn't I supposed to marry somebody?

82
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,149
Yes, Your Honor.

83
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:31,150
- Us.
- What? Already?

84
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,715
Well, it's been five years, Your Honor.

85
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,091
Five seconds in the eyes of the law.

86
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,029
Your wife wasn't dead
until I said she was dead.

87
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,862
Sure you don't want more time
to think about it?

88
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,370
- Oh, I'm sure he doesn't.
- I didn't ask you, young lady.

89
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,770
Your interruptions have been
prolonging this case...

90
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,003
and causing me extreme mental
and physical discomfort.

91
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,173
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I know how painful arthritis can be.

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,240
Oh, you do?
Do you know the kind I've got?

93
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,445
Where your bones begin to crumble
like old peanut brittle?

94
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,513
Has Your Honor
ever considered psychotherapy?

95
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,184
Are you one of those couch nuts?

96
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,161
Well, if you mean psychoanalysis...

97
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,460
surely Your Honor doesn't discount
the contributions Freud has made...

98
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,728
to the relief of human suffering.

99
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,930
Freud's dead,
probably from arthritis.

100
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,463
Now, just be quiet, if that's possible.

101
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,533
Well, are you gonna
answer the question...

102
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,841
or is she going to talk for you
the rest of your life?

103
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,478
- I've forgotten the question, Your Honor.
- Darling, he asked you—

104
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,713
Uh-uh-uh!

105
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,982
I asked if you wanted
to marry this woman.

106
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,388
Why, certainly, Your Honor.

107
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,485
Harvard man.

108
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,722
<i>[Horn Blows]</i>

109
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,864
Can we have some pictures, Captain?
This is front-page news.

110
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,667
- Five years on a desert island.
- Mrs. Arden! Mrs. Arden!

111

- I've got to call my family.
Where's the nearest phone?

- Oh, the booth's over there, Mrs. Arden.
- Thank you.

113
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,905
- Oh! Does anybody have a nickel?
- Phone calls are a dime now.

114
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,314
- A dime? Why?
- Stamps are a nickel.

115
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,716
- Oh.
- Would you like for me to make the call?

116
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,278
- Break the news to them for you?
- Oh. Uh—

117
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,847
Five years.
It may be a bit of a shock to them.

118
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,656
Thank you very much, Captain,
but if you don't mind, I'd like to.

- Operator.
- Operator, I'm dialing Crestview 5-4699...

131
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,304
and a recording said that
I have dialed an incorrect number.

00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,045
I know it's the correct number because for the
past eight years we have had the same number.

wait a minute, please?

Does anyone have a pencil?

00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,202
We can drive you home a lot faster
than you can get that call through, ma'am.

- Would you? Thank you.
- The navy's pleasure.

- Oh, but first we'd like to get some pictures.
- Pictures?

For the newspapers. Mrs. Arden,
you're a real public interest story.

Oh, no. Please don't.
No, I'd like to see my children first.

- Well, of course.

<i>- We have a car waiting for you,</i>
<i>Mrs. Arden, right this way.</i>
- Oh, good. Excuse me.

Oh, Dr. Schlick was so right.

mature relationship now.

00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,787
The State Highway Commission frowns
on commencing a honeymoon in a vehicle.

166
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,852
- Hmm?
- It's a moving violation.

167
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,863
[Chuckling]

168
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,001
Thank you very much.

169
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,115
Thank the whole United States Navy!

170
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,831
<i>- [Girl] It's your turn.</i>
<i>- [Girl #2] I can beat you!</i>

171
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,874
<i>- No, you can't!</i>
- Yes, I can!

172
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,910
- You missed! You missed!
- I did not.

173
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,969
<i>You did too.</i>
<i>You stepped right on the crack.</i>

174
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,413
I did not. Anyway, you made me.

175
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,713
<i>You have to start over again.</i>

176
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:04,119
<i>You splashed water in my eyes.</i>
<i>No fair!</i>

177
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,802
Stop splashing.

178
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,861
<i>That's no fair.</i>

179
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,887
- Hello.
- Hello.

180
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,691
- Hi.
- Shh.

181
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,818
I'm walking a tightrope.

182
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,692
Oh, well, I see you are,
and you're doing very nicely.

183
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,857
Who are you?

184
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,631
I don't think you remember me,
but I remember you.

185
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,570
Are you a lady or a man?

186
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,478
- I used to be a lady.
<i>- [Older Girl] Are you a sailor?</i>

187
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,480
Well, not really, no.

188
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,608
Some sailors helped Daddy
look for our mother once.

189
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,675
She drowned, in the ocean.

190
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,483
- Did she?
<i>- Long time ago.</i>

191
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,719
We're the only one in our whole school
who has a "drownded" mother.

192
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,732
[Chuckles, Sniffs]
Would you like to have her back?

193
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,994
Can't have her back. She's "drownded."

194
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,096
Like this— glug, glug, glug.

195
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,404
<i>[Water Bubbling]</i>

196
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,373
[Sighs]

197
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,348
Um, tell me something.
Do you miss her?

198
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,717
Every Easter, Daddy takes us
to put flowers on her grave.

199
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,722
Her grave?

200
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,782
Don't be sad. She's not in the grave.

201
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,352
She's at the bottom of the ocean—
the deepest part.

202
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,660
Oh, I know.

203
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,724
Tell me about your school,
what you do and everything.

204
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,260
We're not supposed
to talk to strangers.

205
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,365
L— I'm not really a stranger.
I know your daddy.

206
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,774
- Our grandma too?
- Yes.

207
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,372
- She's inside.
- Well, first I wanted to see you.

208
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:14,078
- What for?
- Because I heard that you were both so pretty.

209
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,880
And you are so pretty.

210
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,958
Are you gonna cry?

211
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,660
She was crying, that lady.

212
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,400
- She was not.
- She was so.

213
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,374
<i>Aw, she's just goofy.</i>

214
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,773

we are going to have for dinner.

216
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,922
- Freezer?
- In the freezer.

217
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,083
<i>- ¿Frío?</i>
- A chicken for dinner.

219
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,961
- Listen carefully, Mari—
- Oh.

220
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:01,619
We're going to have chicken,
you know?

221
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:03,631
- Chicken.
- "Cheeken."

- Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

224
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,701
And there will be a man.

00:15:13,775 --> 00:15:15,709
<i>- Un hombre.</i>
<i>- ¿Hombre?</i>

- Come here<i>. Aquí.</i>
<i>- ¿Aquí?</i>

227
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:20,213

00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,988
Wash the "weendows."

231
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,458
Oh. Here he is now.
I'll tell him myself.

232
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:36,656
I want him to start in the den.
And, Maria, you go get the <i>pollo.</i>

Grace, darling, are you all right?

240
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:03,182
I'm sorry. For a minute
I imagined my daughter-in—

Yes, darling, I am. I am.

Oh, come on. Let me help you up.

253
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:54,532
Oh, I tried to call you
to break it to you gently...

255

Oh, I'm sorry.

Make it a fifth.

260
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,589
Where have you been?

261
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,652
On an island in the Pacific
and then on a submarine.

262
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,460
- Submarine?
- I'll tell you about it later.

263
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:21,161
But first, tell me, how's Nicky?

264
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:25,596
Nicky.

He's all right, isn't he?

- Oh.

Well, then what are you crying about?

269
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:41,449
Well, it's gonna be such a shock to him
to find out you're back.

270
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:45,186
Oh, I know it is, and we've got to
figure out a way to tell him.

271
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,252
- Yes.
- What am I gonna do?
Maybe I should call the office.

272
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,321
- Oh.
- I want to call him right now.

273
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:53,391
Uh, no! No, don't.

274
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:56,403

- Well, he's not there.

Oh, yes, when I came in.

Oh, they're so beautiful.

280
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:12,177
Did they recognize you?

281
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:16,520
Of course not, and I didn't know
how to tell them without Nicky.

282
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:21,392
- Where is he?
- Uh, perhaps first you'd better take a bath.

283
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:23,693
- I don't want a bath!
- Well, take one anyway.

284
00:18:23,765 --> 00:18:27,257
- Grace, what's the matter with you?
- Matter?

285
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:30,793
- Are you hiding something from me?
- Hiding? Oh!

286
00:18:30,872 --> 00:18:34,205
Me? Don't be silly.

287
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:37,643
Uh, maybe I'd better
get <i>you</i> that drink.

288
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:40,806
You know perfectly well
I don't drink.

289
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:44,613
- You will.

290

What are you trying to tell me?

291
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:50,991
Let me do that.

292
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,050
Now, what happened?

00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:55,062
Um, Ellen...

294
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:58,122
Nick's married.

295
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:04,966
I'm sorry, dear.

296
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,974
I'm so sorry.

297
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:24,081
<i>Ellen, you know...</i>

298
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,560
Nick loves you more
than anything in the world.

299
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:30,928
And nobody dreamed that you—

300
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:38,038
[Sniffles]

301
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:43,076
Five years is a long time, darling.

302
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,581
Can't expect a healthy man
to wait forever.

303
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,381
Just how long did he wait?

304
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:56,049
Until this morning.

305
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:58,354
[Gasps]
<i>This</i> this morning?

306
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,417
Yes, about—

307
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:03,826
Ellen, you're not too late.

308
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,595
- Come on.
- Grace, what are you doing?

309
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:09,466
Calling the airline,
get you out on the next flight.

310
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:13,338
- What flight? Where?
- You'll be at the hotel before they arrive.

311
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:17,401
- I can't do that, Grace!
- Why can't you? You're his wife.

312
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,777
- So is she.
- She's his bride.

313
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,873
- What's the difference?
- A honeymoon.

314
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,249
And you're not
gonna let them have one.

315
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,914
But first we gotta find you
something to wear...

316
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:30,856
then I'll call
for the next flight to Monterey.

317
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,860
- Monterey?
- Yeah.

318
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:36,091
- You mean he's taking her to our hotel?
- Yes.

319
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:38,894
Doesn't that make you fighting mad?

320
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:48,108
Oh, no.

321
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,077
I think that's terribly sweet.

322
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:57,118
Oh, brother. You have been away.

323
00:20:57,185 --> 00:21:00,177
Oh, we had such
a lovely honeymoon there.

324
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:01,882
Come on!

325
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,323
Oh, I'm sorry.

326
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,061
Keep the change.

327
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:44,963
- Uh, yes, ma'am?
- Pardon me. Has Mr. Nicholas Arden arrived yet?

328
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,627
- Oh, we're expecting him shortly.
- Oh.

329
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:50,330
- Would you like to leave a message?
- Oh, no, thank you.

330
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,896
I'd rather surp— I'll just wait.

331
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:28,339
No, please. Leave the makeup kit
straight up, quickly.

332

00:34:57,635 --> 00:35:01,696
if-if you'd seen the memorial service
we had for you.

501
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:03,706
Memorial service?

502
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:07,433
There were over 200 people there.

503
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:14,311
It was the most beautiful service
that I've ever attended.

504
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:16,319
Really?

505
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:21,324
I—I-I sent a blanket of carnations...

506
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:23,519
that covered the whole altar.

507
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:27,463
Oh, Nicky.

508
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:31,963
What—What color?

509
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:34,266
Your color— pink.

510
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,800
Pink.

511
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,571
After the choir sang...

512
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:43,442
a hush fell over
the— the whole church...

513
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:46,813
as Dr. Slocum came forward
to deliver the eulogy.

514
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:51,044
What did he say?

515
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:53,214
Oh, what every one of us knew.

516
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,124
That you were an angel on Earth...

517
00:35:57,194 --> 00:36:01,028
a wonderful mother, a devoted wife...

518
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:05,694
credit to the community...

519
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,760
and a darn good sport.

520
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,864
Oh, Nicky. Really?

521
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:12,875
Me?

522
00:36:12,943 --> 00:36:15,935
There wasn't a dry eye
in the congregation.

523
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:18,413
Oh. Gosh, I wish I'd been there.

524
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:23,450
If you had been there,
there wouldn't have been a service.

525
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:28,356
- Oh! That's right.

526
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:30,825
Oh.
[Kissing]

527
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:34,697
Uh, Nick.

528
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:39,792
Um, what about the, um...

529
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,963
insurance?

530
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:45,531
- What about it?
- It was $100,000, wasn't it?

531
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:47,668
No, 50. I'm a hundred.

532
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:50,976
Oh. Did you collect it?

533
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:52,982
Not yet.

534
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,451
You weren't legally dead
until this morning.

535
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,852
And you didn't claim it right away.

536
00:36:58,922 --> 00:37:01,550
Well, I never even thought about it.

537
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,856
Oh, Nicky. You do love me!

00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:09,930

<i>[Buzzing Continues]</i>

540
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:18,063
- May I see you for a moment?
- Well, what is it?

541
00:37:18,142 --> 00:37:20,633
Mr. Arden, as a resident manager
of this hotel...

542
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:24,203
I find it my duty to inform you
that when a man takes a room here...

543
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:26,806
we expect him to go to that room
with his own wife.

544
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:29,682
<i>We do not expect that wife</i>
<i>to be paging him constantly...</i>

545
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:32,244
when he is next door
dallying with another woman.

546
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:35,849
<i>Dallying? Oh, he's not dallying.</i>

547
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:38,258
- Please, madam, do not interfere—
- Mr. Codd.

548
00:37:38,328 --> 00:37:41,195
- We will not be made a party to intrigue.
- Oh, now wait a minute!

549
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:45,201
This establishment's maintained
a reputation for respectability for 25 years.

550
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,601
We do not intend
to lose it in one night.

551
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:51,368
<i>Well, you could lose more than your reputation</i>
<i>with that kind ofloose talk.</i>

552
00:37:51,442 --> 00:37:53,376
Loose? My dear sir...

553
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:55,935
as a hotel manager
of many years experience...

554
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:58,777
I can sniff hanky-panky
in an air-conditioned building.

555
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:01,181
Hanky-panky? You get out of here.

556
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:04,243
I am leaving. I am leaving.
There's only one thing we ask.

557
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:07,381
That you restrict yourself
to one suite, one wife.

558
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,790
- That's the American way.
- Right.

559
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,387
- Ellen!
- I absolutely agree.

560
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:16,058
Oh? Fine.

561
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:18,124
Then you'll leave?

562
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:21,228
Leave? Why should I leave?
I'm Mrs. Arden.

563
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:23,239
- You are?
- Yes.

564
00:38:24,508 --> 00:38:26,601
Tell him, darling.

565
00:38:30,147 --> 00:38:34,516
And you allowed your husband to register
in this hotel with another woman?

566
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:37,019
- Why do you think I'm here?
- Oh, Ellen. Stop it!

567
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:40,579
Unless I'm very much mistaken,
you registered the first one as Mrs. Arden...

568
00:38:40,657 --> 00:38:42,887
this one as Miss Wagstaff.

569
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,622
- He didn't think you'd notice.
- He—

570
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:50,656
I don't know what you two—
or you three— think you're doing...

571
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:54,397
but I insist that one of your women
leave this hotel at once!

572
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:57,031
Right. I absolutely agree.

573
00:38:57,107 --> 00:38:59,234
Ellen! Look, I'll explain.

574
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,573
It's really a very simple situation.

575
00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:04,136
You see, my wife— my bride—
She's my wife.

576
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:07,206
What my husband is trying to tell you
is that he has two wives.

577
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:09,775
- Yes!
- I don't care if he has 10 wives.

578
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:12,845
As long as he's in this hotel,
he will have only one wife—

579
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:15,915
the one that he registered here
as his wife— his first wife.

580
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:17,927
- His second wife?
- You're confused.

581
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,929
- Yes!
- I can explain it.

582
00:39:19,997 --> 00:39:22,761
You do that, darling.
First him, and then to her.

583
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,994
- See you later, sweetheart.
- I'll be right back.

584
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:27,559
- [Kissing]
- Not while I'm manager here.

585
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:39,005
I'll have to go down for the key.

586
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:46,820
- Mrs. Arden.
- Yes?

587
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,824
I found your husband.

588
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:52,259
It's certainly high time.
I'm awfully sorry I had to bother you.

589
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,264
Thank you very much. It was very—

590
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:58,631
Where have you been? I've never
been so humiliated in my whole life!

591
00:39:58,702 --> 00:40:02,968
Oh, now, Bianca. I was down in the lobby,
and I ran into someone.

592
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,974
An old buddy.

593
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:08,705
I don't care who you ran into! Leaving me
here all alone for some old army buddy!

594
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:10,770
Navy. It was a navy buddy.

595
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:12,838
Oh, Nicholas!
You've been gone for hours.

596
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,907
It wasn't hours. Only a few minutes.

597
00:40:14,985 --> 00:40:17,476
You just don't love me anymore.
I've been so miserable!

598
00:40:17,554 --> 00:40:20,546
- Now, please, Bianca, don't be so upset.
- How do you expect me to feel?

599
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:24,651
You're just like all the others. Every husband
I ever had— only thinking of themselves.

600
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:28,323
I was thinking of you.
The problem never left my mind.

601
00:40:28,398 --> 00:40:32,300
"Problem"? Problem!
Now all I am to you is a problem!

602
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:35,600
Well, if that's all I am to you,
you can just go jump in the lake!

603
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:37,833
- Put that down, Bianca!
- Don't you bully me!

604
00:40:37,908 --> 00:40:40,308
Making me call
all over the hotel for you!

605
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:42,868
You're selfish! That's what you are!
You're selfish, selfish, selfish!

606
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:46,677
- Lower your voice, Bianca.
- I don't care if the whole hotel hears me!
I hate you!

Well, it won't be easy.

do you remember that song?

835
00:55:35,914 --> 00:55:39,475
<i>- I heard it someplace.</i>
- Where?

836
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:42,850
On the radio, I think.
I don't like it.

837
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:45,481
Oh.

838
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:49,060
Are you gonna stay here?

839
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:51,358
Would you like me to?

840
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,660
Where would you sleep?

841
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:57,294
Well, in the guest room.

842
00:55:57,369 --> 00:55:59,496
Bianca's gonna sleep there.

843
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:04,702
No, she's gonna sleep in Daddy's room
because she's our new mother.

844
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:07,610
I don't want her to.

845
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,613
Don't you want a mother?

846
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:12,013
- No. Just Daddy.
- Yeah.

847
00:56:19,558 --> 00:56:21,549
Good night.

848
00:56:32,037 --> 00:56:33,971
Good night.

849
00:56:38,577 --> 00:56:41,978
Moo! Moo!

850
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:45,916
[Swishing]

851
00:56:45,984 --> 00:56:48,214
- Ah! <i>Leche.</i>
<i>- Leche.</i>

852
00:56:48,287 --> 00:56:51,654
<i>- Sí, señora.</i> [Spanish]
- Grace. Grace.

853
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:54,521
You'd better start studying Spanish,
or learn to play charades.

854
00:56:54,593 --> 00:56:58,188
- Who was that on the phone?
- Oh. Yeah, sit down, Ellen.

855
00:56:58,263 --> 00:57:00,561
It was Nick.
He's not coming home.

856
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:03,692
- He is coming home.
- Well— Oh, then he told her.

857
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:06,863
- Grace, he told her.
- Actually, it was Bianca who called.

858
00:57:06,939 --> 00:57:09,806
- Bianca?
- Now, don't get excited, honey.

859
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:12,708
Nick's had a little accident.
N-Nothing serious.

860
00:57:12,778 --> 00:57:15,440
- He hurt his back.
- His back?

861
00:57:16,782 --> 00:57:19,444
He could've slipped or something.

862
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:21,713
Well, he could have.

863
00:57:21,787 --> 00:57:23,846
And they'll be here
first thing tomorrow morning.

864
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:27,181
- You mean he's gonna bring that woman here?
- Shh!

865
00:57:27,259 --> 00:57:29,727
- In my house?
- Simmer down, Ellen.

866
00:57:29,795 --> 00:57:32,662
- You'll upset the children
and make a worse mess of things.
- Oh!

867
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:34,858
There must be some way
to handle this.

868
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:37,333
What do you want me to do,
hide in the attic?

869
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:40,496
Don't be silly.
There's a very simple solution.

870
00:57:40,572 --> 00:57:43,837
- What?
- You can go to a hotel for a couple of days.

871
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:46,241
- I will not be thrown out of my own house!
- Shh!

872
00:57:46,311 --> 00:57:48,506
This is as much my house
as it is his.

873
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,605
- How can we explain your being here?
<i>- [Maria]</i> Leche!

874
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:53,276
[Spanish]

875
00:57:53,352 --> 00:57:57,652
<i>- Gracias.</i>
<i>- Por nada. Por nada. Por nada. Ypor nada.</i>

876
00:57:57,723 --> 00:58:00,214
Why don't you let her go
and make me the cook?

877
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:03,819
Oh, I can think of some lovely dishes
to make for them.

878
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:06,922
No, dear. We'd better think
of something else.

879
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:25,611
Jenny! Jenny!

880
00:58:25,684 --> 00:58:28,118
You forgot your sweater!

881
00:58:28,187 --> 00:58:30,155
Oh, dear.

882
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,794
Ellen!

883
00:58:41,066 --> 00:58:43,000
Ellen?

884
00:58:44,236 --> 00:58:46,534
Ellen! They're here.

885
00:59:06,558 --> 00:59:10,153
For heaven's sakes, Nicky!
You look terrible.

886
00:59:10,229 --> 00:59:13,096
I feel terrible.

887
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:15,895
Well, don't you worry, Son.
We'll take care of you.

888
00:59:15,968 --> 00:59:17,902
Oh, I'll take care of him.

889
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:22,430
<i>[With Swedish Accent]</i>
<i>No. I will be the one to take care.</i>

890
00:59:22,507 --> 00:59:25,442
- Who's that?
- Uh, that's Miss Svensson.

891
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,637
- Uh, she's Swedish.
- Svensson?

892
00:59:27,713 --> 00:59:30,648
Uh, the nurse I engaged for you.

893
00:59:30,716 --> 00:59:33,617
<i>Ja.</i> My name is Greta Svensson.

894
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:37,587
Is Swedish name. You call me Greta.

895
00:59:37,656 --> 00:59:40,022
Well, Nicholas doesn't need
a nurse, Mother Arden.

896
00:59:40,092 --> 00:59:43,186
- I'm gonna call Dr. Schlick for him.
- The psychiatrist?

897
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:46,129
Oh, yes. I'm sure his trouble
is psychogenic.

898
00:59:46,198 --> 00:59:48,223
He has a deep-seated anxiety neurosis.

899
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,234
[Normal Voice]
Deep-seated?

900
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:52,532
[With Accent]
In his back?

901
00:59:52,604 --> 00:59:54,936
Well, you see, l—
I just had an accident.

902
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,101
I was running down some—well,
up some stairs— and I tripped and fell.

903
00:59:58,176 --> 01:00:00,644
- I had all my clothes on at the time!
- Uh, Nicholas, dear—

904
01:00:00,712 --> 01:00:03,374
It was early last night—very early—
just before dinner even.

905
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,939
Darling, you don't have to explain
anything to Miss Svensson.

906
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:08,748
- Oh, but I do. She's here to help me, isn't she?
- Oh, yes.

907
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,948
Ooh, <i>ja.</i>
And give good Swedish massage.

908
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:15,858
Don't worry, lady.
I fix his aching back. Uh, come.

909
01:00:15,927 --> 01:00:19,488
Uh, well, thank you. But first, would you
go out and bring our luggage in?

910
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:22,055
- Me?
- Well, of course you.

911
01:00:22,134 --> 01:00:24,102
Come, Nicholas.

912
01:00:25,437 --> 01:00:28,099
Darling, I've never seen
the bedrooms in this house.

913
01:00:28,173 --> 01:00:31,438
- How many have we?
- Not nearly enough.

914
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,640
Oh! I'll be right up, dear,
as soon as I call Dr. Schlick.

915
01:00:41,286 --> 01:00:43,686
Just wait'll I get my hands on him.

916
01:00:43,755 --> 01:00:45,882
Now, now, Ellen. Temper, temper.

917
01:00:45,957 --> 01:00:48,687
Everything's working out just fine.

918
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,252
Fine? How dare she come in here
and order me around!

919
01:00:52,331 --> 01:00:56,097
I'll have a little talk
with her about your duties.

920
01:00:56,168 --> 01:00:58,830
And I'll have a talk with him about his.

921
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:03,102
Well, uh, when Dr. Schlick is free,
would you have him call me...

922
01:01:03,175 --> 01:01:07,839
at... 235-4505, please?

923
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,471
Thank you.

924
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:15,350
Mother Arden!
I thought the nurse was doing that.

925
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:20,119
She helped. But, uh, she's going
to give Nick his massage.

926
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:23,727
Oh, here, Ellen. Here.

927
01:01:23,795 --> 01:01:25,922
- Let's talk—
- You just keep away from me.

928
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:28,625
You had all night to tell her.
All night!

929
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,100
I've tried to tell her, believe me. L—

930
01:01:31,169 --> 01:01:34,104
- Here, would you get me out of this straitjacket?
- Let her get you out.

931
01:01:34,172 --> 01:01:37,232
- She got you into it.
- Nobody got me into anything.

932
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:41,040
Nothin' happened. Why do you think
I went to all this trouble?

933
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:43,206
- Faking a bad back!
- Faking?

934
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:46,182
I don't believe you.

935
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:48,776
Here. Does it look like
I've got a sprained back?

936
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:54,625
Nicholas!

937
01:01:56,862 --> 01:01:58,796
It works.
[Chuckles]

938
01:01:58,864 --> 01:02:01,298
- What works?
- Greta's massage.

939
01:02:01,366 --> 01:02:03,698
- So soon?
- Yeah, how about that?

940
01:02:03,769 --> 01:02:06,966
Oh, <i>ja.</i> Special Swedish massage.

941
01:02:07,038 --> 01:02:09,233
- Isn't she marvelous?
- Marvelous?

942
01:02:09,307 --> 01:02:11,241
It— It's almost a miracle.

943
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:13,869
Was no miracle.
Was just the touch in fingers.

944
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:17,815
Oh, I give you massage too.

945
01:02:17,883 --> 01:02:19,874
Very good after long drive.

946
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:22,442
- Well, I don't know. I really don't usually—
- Oh, <i>ja, ja.</i>

947
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:26,457
- I fix you just like husband.
- What?

948
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:28,891
Uh, Miss Svensson, uh—

949
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,895
- I don't think that you—
- Oh, <i>ja, ja,</i> it be fine.

950
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:34,761
Give you chance
to talk with your son.

951
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,267
- Oh, yes, see that he rests, Mother Arden.
- Come. Come.

952
01:02:37,335 --> 01:02:40,930
You must take off your clothes. Mmm.

953
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:44,169
What's going on around here?
Where'd she ever get such an idea?

954
01:02:44,242 --> 01:02:46,176
A nurse. And Swedish.

955
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:48,576
Necessity is the mother of invention...

956
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:50,615
and I was the mother who invented it.

957
01:02:50,682 --> 01:02:52,650
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just a little.

958
01:02:52,717 --> 01:02:57,484
I can't quite seem to adjust to two
daughters-in-law for only one son.

959
01:02:57,556 --> 01:03:00,821
Well, as long as you had only one,
why did it have to be me?

960
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:04,089
<i>Ja.</i> Lie down here on the bed, miss.

961
01:03:04,162 --> 01:03:06,096
It's missus.

962
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:11,432
Your husband's mother tell me
you been Mr. Arden's second wife.

963
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:13,869
Mm-hmm. He was a widower.

964
01:03:13,939 --> 01:03:15,463
<i>- Ja.</i>
- That's nice.

965
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:19,203
His poor wife lost
in the airplane accident.

966
01:03:19,277 --> 01:03:22,906
- My mother-in-law likes to chat.
<i>- Ja.</i>

967
01:03:22,981 --> 01:03:25,415
I was thinking before—

968
01:03:25,484 --> 01:03:29,853
What if Mr. Arden's
first wife didn't was dead?

969
01:03:29,921 --> 01:03:32,389
[Chuckles]
What an idea!

970
01:03:32,457 --> 01:03:36,018
When I was a little girl in Sweden,
I went once to the movies.

971
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:39,120
Poor Cary Grant thought
his first wife was dead...

972
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:42,132
so he married another lady.

973
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,863
But Irene Dunne,
who was the first wife...

974
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:48,667
she come back.

975
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,402
Movies. When do movies
ever reflect real life?

976
01:03:51,476 --> 01:03:54,934
<i>Ja.</i> But suppose
Mr. Arden's first wife...

977
01:03:55,013 --> 01:03:58,540
was to come back
like Irene Dunne done— did.

978
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:00,551
- What would happen?
- Nothing would happen.

979
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:03,884
She'd still be legally dead
in the eyes of the law, and as long as she—

980
01:04:03,955 --> 01:04:06,287
Ow! Not— Not so hard!

981
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:10,055
But if she was dead by law
and alive by everything else, then what?

982
01:04:10,128 --> 01:04:12,289
I couldn't care less.
Mr. Arden's mine now.

983
01:04:12,364 --> 01:04:14,696
She'd just have to go back
to where she came from.

984
01:04:14,766 --> 01:04:16,063
- Ooh!
- Ow!

985
01:04:16,134 --> 01:04:18,864
- She would? She would?
- Ow! Ow!

986
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:20,928
It's just what you need!

987
01:04:21,006 --> 01:04:22,940
- It's good for you!
- Stop it!

988
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:26,603
All right, Mom. I'll tell her.

989
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:28,839
About time.

990
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:34,181
- First, I'd better have a cup of coffee.
- Oh, Nick.

991
01:04:34,252 --> 01:04:36,846
<i>[Bianca]</i>
<i>Ow! Don't do that. Ouch!</i>

992
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:40,119
<i>Stop that! Nicholas. Help me!</i>

993
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:42,853
<i>Is good special Swedish massage!</i>

994
01:04:42,928 --> 01:04:46,329
I walk up and down your back!

995
01:04:46,398 --> 01:04:48,696
<i>On my back?</i>

996
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,928
With your shoes on?

997
01:04:51,002 --> 01:04:53,994
- Is— Is wonderful for the spine!
- Ow!

998
01:04:54,072 --> 01:04:56,905

- Get back over there!

I don't want that woman here!

1009

For your information, Bianca,
this woman is not "that woman."

1010
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:23,694
It's time we had an understanding.
Damn it, I can't fire her.

1011
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:25,702

- Morning. Your name Arden?
- Oh, yes, it is, but—

1017
01:05:43,054 --> 01:05:45,852
Prokey's my name. Clyde Prokey.
I'm with American Accident and Life.

1018
01:05:45,924 --> 01:05:49,257
Hey, hey. This is quite a nice little place
you got here, Arden.

1019
01:05:49,327 --> 01:05:51,386
I don't have time to talk
about insurance this morning.

1020
01:05:51,463 --> 01:05:54,591
I'm not selling insurance, Mr. Arden.
I'm with the Claims Division.

1021
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:57,226
My card. Clyde Prokey, adjuster.

1022
01:05:57,302 --> 01:05:59,236
Got a little matter here
requires a signature.

1023
01:05:59,304 --> 01:06:02,102
- All my policies are with the Eastern Life—
- Not your signature, Mr. Arden.

1024
01:06:02,173 --> 01:06:04,232
This is for Mrs. Arden. She here?

1025
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:06,607
Well, which Mrs. Arden?

1026
01:06:06,678 --> 01:06:11,081
- How many you got?
- Well, uh, my mother. And there's my—

1027
01:06:11,149 --> 01:06:14,516
No. I mean your wife. The one
who was on that island for five years.

1028
01:06:14,586 --> 01:06:17,248
- How do you know about that?
- Well, that's my job to know, Arden.

1029
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:20,553
Everything. Every little thing.

1030
01:06:21,993 --> 01:06:24,962
But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with Clyde Prokey.

1031
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,522
I'm a married man myself.
Now where is the little lady?

1032
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:32,229
Uh, well, Mr. Prokey, I don't think
we should disturb her just now.

1033
01:06:32,303 --> 01:06:35,363
- Things have been
a little complicated around here.
- Yeah. How about that!

1034
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,102
Uh, now,
what are these papers about?

1035
01:06:38,176 --> 01:06:40,508
I gotta say, Arden,
I take my hat off to you.

1036
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:42,842
I don't think I'd be
taking it as calm as you.

1037
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:45,405
Believe me, I haven't had a calm moment.
Let's see the papers.

1038
01:06:45,483 --> 01:06:47,951
What's to see? Just an affidavit
for the missus to sign.

1039
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:51,113
What kind of affidavit? She won't sign
anything unless I've seen it first.

1040
01:06:51,189 --> 01:06:53,589
[Laughs]
You lawyers. Okay, here.

1041
01:06:53,658 --> 01:06:56,388
Affidavit that Stephen Burkett
is indeed alive...

1042
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:58,588
so his family will return
the insurance money.

1043
01:06:58,663 --> 01:07:00,597
Routine, Mr. Arden. Just routine.

1044
01:07:00,665 --> 01:07:03,634
Uh, who is this Stephen Burkett?

1045
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:06,227
The guy they rescued
off the island with your wife.

1046
01:07:10,475 --> 01:07:13,740
Aw, gee, fella. Sorry.
L— l— I thought you knew.

1047
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:17,338
Oh, of course I know.
Knew. Burkett.

<i>Yeah, he seems like a nice guy.</i>

1050
01:07:21,486 --> 01:07:24,080
Straight shooter. Called us about
his insurance the day he got back.

1051
01:07:24,155 --> 01:07:27,647
- He did, huh?
- Yeah.

1052
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:31,059
I, uh, buzzed over to see him yesterday
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

1053
01:07:31,129 --> 01:07:33,495
Looks none the worse for wear.

1054
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:38,332
Must've been a rugged experience,
the two of them alone there on that island.

1055
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:41,031
- I guess he told you all about it?
- Well, not all.

1056
01:07:41,106 --> 01:07:43,097
After all, he is a gentleman.

I mean, uh, h-he thinks
the world of your missus.

1058
01:07:47,145 --> 01:07:49,409
Says she's a warm, wonderful woman.

1059
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:52,041
- And a darn good sport.
- That figures.

1060
01:07:52,117 --> 01:07:54,210
I mean,
it takes two intelligent people...

1061
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:58,278
to turn a Pacific island into,
uh, the Garden of Eden, right?

1062
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:00,290
Right.

1063
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:04,021
Uh, Mr. Prokey, I'll keep your affidavits.
I'll send them to you in the mail.

1064
01:08:04,095 --> 01:08:06,586
No, no, they've got to be signed
in my presence.

1065

- Adam? Who's Adam?

1066
01:08:09,868 --> 01:08:12,610
- Burkett.
- It says Stephen Burkett.

1067

Didn't she tell you about
that little gag they had going?

Mr. Prokey, do you mind leaving?

1071
01:08:30,128 --> 01:08:33,154

- Oh?

I wanna hear about you and Adam!

1078

L— I meant to tell you about that.

Oh, you meant to tell me about it?

1080
01:09:07,532 --> 01:09:10,695
It was such a casual thing
that it just slipped your mind?

1081
01:09:10,768 --> 01:09:15,034
Well, I never had a chance.
Besides, it was... perfectly harmless.

Harmless?
You call "Adam and Eve" harmless?

the other four and a half years?

1085

Don't you trust your own wife?

1086
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:33,413
Oh, no. Don't try to change the subject.
I want to know the truth about Adam.

1087
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:37,719
That's a joke!

Oh, sweet, gentle little Adam.

1089
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,560
All he was interested in
is trees and flowers and fish.

Well, it's important enough
to make Nick insanely jealous.

I know.
And he hasn't even seen him.

Pleased to meet ya, Nick.

1161
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:04,361
Yeah, and I to meet you, Adam.

1162
01:18:04,435 --> 01:18:07,029
- Well, that— that's a little joke, you know.
- Yes, isn't it?

1164

Well, why don't we all sit down, huh?

01:18:14,678 --> 01:18:16,612
Well, I, uh—
[Clears Throat]

1166
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,807
L— I really haven't much time.

1167
01:18:18,882 --> 01:18:22,181
I, uh— I'm making a report
to the Geographic Society...

1168
01:18:22,252 --> 01:18:25,449
on the flora and fauna
we found on the island.

1169
01:18:25,522 --> 01:18:29,424
I was really very excited
about the island vegetation.

1170
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:32,956
I'm afraid I spent
so much time on research...

1171
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:35,521
I was not very good company
for your wife.

1172
01:18:35,599 --> 01:18:39,968
- Well, I'm sure she understood.
- Of course.

1173
01:18:40,037 --> 01:18:43,871
Uh, Eve said you had some
questions to ask me, Nick.

1174
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:47,240
Well, uh, let me see, uh—

1175
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:51,013
What kind of an island was it?

1176
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,049
Kind?

1177
01:18:54,218 --> 01:18:57,881
Uh, uh, well, I'd say it was a—

1178
01:18:57,955 --> 01:18:59,889
an ordinary island.

1179
01:18:59,957 --> 01:19:02,425
- Wouldn't you say?
- Oh, y— Oh, yes.

1180
01:19:02,493 --> 01:19:05,087
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Small?

1181
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:08,154
<i>Well, not small. Not large.</i>

1182
01:19:08,232 --> 01:19:11,395
- Medium.
- Medium. Medium.

1183
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:15,171
Uh, jungle?

1184
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:18,970
<i>- Jungle?</i>
- Well, y-you know, trees, vines.

1185

Oh, trees!
[Chuckles]

1186
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:23,370
Oh, golly, yeah, trees.

1187
01:19:24,915 --> 01:19:27,645

- Oh, uh—

1188
01:19:27,718 --> 01:19:31,950

V-Vines, yeah. Around the trees.

1191

Oh, yeah, water.
Uh, around the island.

1192

Where'd you live?

1193
01:19:42,466 --> 01:19:44,934
The trees.
We lived— lived in trees.

1194
01:19:45,002 --> 01:19:47,232
- Oh.
- Separate trees.

1195
01:19:47,304 --> 01:19:50,603
Oh. Even during the rainy season?

1196
01:19:52,643 --> 01:19:56,909
- Oh, when it rained, we moved into caves.
- Oh.

1197
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,175
Separate caves.

1198
01:19:59,249 --> 01:20:03,185
Well, uh, I guess Adam
had better be running along.

1199
01:20:03,253 --> 01:20:05,881
- Oh, must you?
- Well, I don't know. L—

1200
01:20:05,956 --> 01:20:09,824
Well, you know the Geographic Society
insists on punctuality, Adam.

1201
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:12,384
And if Adam is anything, he's punctual.

1202
01:20:12,463 --> 01:20:15,762
A sterling quality.
Well, it's been nice meeting you, Adam.

1203
01:20:15,833 --> 01:20:19,234
- Hey, uh, we should get together sometime, huh?
- Yeah. That's a good idea.

1204
01:20:19,303 --> 01:20:21,294
Maybe we should make a night of it.

1205
01:20:21,371 --> 01:20:24,306
- Have some chow mein, go bowling or something.
- Yeah, sure.

- Well, uh, Thursday—

<i>- Good-bye, Adam.</i>
- Good-bye.

1209
01:20:31,515 --> 01:20:33,483
- Real nice chap.
- Thank you.

1210
01:20:35,385 --> 01:20:37,319
There now.

1211
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:41,190
- Satisfied?
- Completely.

1212
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:43,818
Are you ashamed
of all those nasty suspicions?

1213
01:20:43,894 --> 01:20:46,829
- I blush at the thought.
- Oh, Nicky.

1214
01:20:46,897 --> 01:20:51,300
Imagine thinking
that sweet little man and I were—

1215
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:55,134
Really!

Oh, sweetheart. Look—

1218
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:07,544
Now that you're here,
why don't we go for a drive...

1219
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:09,609
and maybe stop for
something to drink, huh?

1220
01:21:09,686 --> 01:21:12,246
Oh, I'd love it.
Um, will you let me drive?

1221
01:21:12,322 --> 01:21:14,256
- Oh, sure.
- I need the practice.

Whew. I didn't do too badly, did I?

1225
01:21:28,762 --> 01:21:30,957
Oh, no. Except when
you made that left-hand turn...

1226
01:21:31,031 --> 01:21:33,226
you signaled
with your windshield wipers.

1227
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,996
It's all those buttons, Nicky.
They confuse me.

1228
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:38,003

- Right this way, please.

Oh, uh, why don't you sit there?
I'll sit here.

1233

- Oh. Why?
- Uh, keep the sun out of your eyes.

about for five years—

1239
01:22:19,646 --> 01:22:22,513
- And you, sir?
- Scotch, please.

1240
01:22:22,582 --> 01:22:24,880
- A big, fat double?
- On the rocks.

1241
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:31,781
- You sure you wouldn't rather sit over here?
- I'm fine.

1242
01:22:31,858 --> 01:22:34,292

don't you think?

1246

Oh, Nicky. You're funny.

1247

1248
01:22:49,276 --> 01:22:51,870
You're trying so hard
to make conversation with me.

Oh, Nicky.
I know it hasn't been easy for you.

Oh, they are. They're marvelous.

1253
01:23:07,093 --> 01:23:10,460
And you've just done the most
wonderful job of raising them.

Oh, kids aren't hard to bring up.

1255
01:23:14,434 --> 01:23:17,164
You just pretend they're someone else's.

1256
01:23:17,237 --> 01:23:20,229
But they're not someone else's.
They're ours.

1257
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:25,867
Oh, and I can't seem to find
a way to tell them who I am.

Well, we'll work it out.

Nick, there's—

1260

there's something that I'd—
I'd like to tell you.

1261

Well?

1262
01:23:44,731 --> 01:23:49,532
Oh, I'm such a dope. And I meant well,
Nick, but I'm such a dope.

1263
01:23:49,603 --> 01:23:52,697
About what?

1264
01:23:52,772 --> 01:23:56,003
That man that I brought to your office
was not Stephen Burkett.

1265
01:23:56,076 --> 01:23:59,978
- Really?
- No. He was a shoe clerk.

1266
01:24:00,046 --> 01:24:02,378
And I paid him to say those things.

1267
01:24:05,252 --> 01:24:08,688
Oh, Nick, I thought if you met
the real Stephen Burkett...

1268
01:24:08,755 --> 01:24:10,916
that you just— that you just might—

1269
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:13,755
I might what?

Well, I thought that you might think
what I thought you were thinking...

1271
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:19,121
you know,
when you thought that— that—

1272
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,534
Well, he is kind of attractive.

1273
01:24:22,602 --> 01:24:25,469
Burkett?

1274
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:28,473
Oh, not to me. Not to me at all.

1275
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:30,771
But— But some people
might think so.

1276
01:24:30,844 --> 01:24:33,404
And l— I was just so afraid—
so afraid that you might—

1277
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,448
that you might be upset.

01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:53,105
Get me out of here!

1320
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:56,472
Oh!

1321
01:29:15,161 --> 01:29:17,823
Oh, my hair!

1322
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,334
[Screams]
Oh, help!

1323
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:38,179
[Screams]
Oh, help!

1324
01:29:53,433 --> 01:29:55,025
Ellen!

1325
01:30:12,952 --> 01:30:15,819
I can't help myself, Dr. Schlick.

1326
01:30:15,888 --> 01:30:18,584
That's how I feel about my marriage.

1327
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:22,594
Very well. I will have
a little chat with your Nicholas.

1328
01:30:22,662 --> 01:30:27,929
- If he arrives ever.
- Oh, you are such a comfort, Doctor.

1329
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:30,333
You know, I truly believe...

1330
01:30:30,403 --> 01:30:33,201
the most vital relationship
a woman can establish...

1331
01:30:33,273 --> 01:30:36,902
is not between man and wife.

1332
01:30:36,976 --> 01:30:41,174
It's the relationship between
a woman and her analyst.

1333
01:30:41,247 --> 01:30:44,341
Don't you agree, Dr. Schlick?

1334
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:46,851
Call me Herman.

1335
01:31:02,502 --> 01:31:04,470
Will you wait a minute, please?

1336
01:31:07,173 --> 01:31:09,300
[Doorbell Rings]

1337
01:31:14,213 --> 01:31:16,204
- Ellen. Wait!
- [Banging]

1338
01:31:19,185 --> 01:31:21,119
Ellen, wait.

1339
01:31:21,187 --> 01:31:24,520
- We can settle this thing right here and now.
- Ooh!

1340
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:28,219
Ow! Oh, Ellen, stop—
Ellen, come here. Listen to me.

1341
01:31:28,294 --> 01:31:31,092
- I said let go of me!
- Nicholas!

1342
01:31:31,164 --> 01:31:34,361
- See what I mean, Herman?
- You didn't say he was violent.

1343
01:31:34,434 --> 01:31:36,994
- Nicholas.
- What on earth is all this yelling about?

1344
01:31:37,070 --> 01:31:39,004
Nicholas, let that woman go!

1345
01:31:39,072 --> 01:31:41,506
- Not until she answers my question!
- I won't answer anything.

1346
01:31:41,574 --> 01:31:45,010
- You big bully!
- I want to know what happened on that island.

1347
01:31:45,078 --> 01:31:48,570
You don't have to know anything. You should learn
to trust your wife, with no questions asked!

1348
01:31:48,648 --> 01:31:52,243
- He doesn't trust you?
- Not her. Her. She's my wife!

1349
01:31:52,318 --> 01:31:54,286
- Oh.
- There! I said it. Are you satisfied?

1350
01:31:54,354 --> 01:31:57,016
- You're my wife!
- I was your wife!

1351
01:31:57,090 --> 01:32:01,117
- Oh, you poor dear boy.
- Oh, Mom, will you tell her Ellen's my wife?

1352
01:32:01,194 --> 01:32:04,493
- Who is this Ellen?
- She's my wife, stupid!

1353
01:32:04,564 --> 01:32:06,498
His first wife. She's dead!

1354
01:32:06,566 --> 01:32:09,592
- And that woman—
- That's the nurse I told you about.

1355
01:32:09,669 --> 01:32:12,137
A nurse from the Busy Bee Car Wash?

1356
01:32:12,205 --> 01:32:14,673
She is not a nurse!
These are her clothes.

1357
01:32:14,741 --> 01:32:19,075
- She is Ellen Wagstaff Arden, my wife, stupid!
<i>- [Doorbell Rings]</i>

1358
01:32:20,346 --> 01:32:22,314
- Yes?
- You Nicholas Arden?

1359
01:32:22,382 --> 01:32:25,078
- Yes. What do you want?
- We have a warrant for your arrest.

1360
01:32:25,151 --> 01:32:27,517
Arrest? What for?

1361
01:32:27,587 --> 01:32:29,851
- Bigamy.
- Bigamy?

1362
01:32:29,922 --> 01:32:31,856
There, now do you believe me?

1363
01:32:31,924 --> 01:32:34,654
But he's not a bigamist.
Who made such a ridiculous charge?

1364
01:32:34,727 --> 01:32:37,423
- Yeah.
- A Mrs. Grace Arden.

1365
01:32:37,497 --> 01:32:40,193
- My... mother?
- That's right.

1366
01:32:40,266 --> 01:32:44,896
If you can't settle this mess,
maybe the courts can.

1367
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:49,367
Quiet. Quiet!
Can't we have a little order in here?

1368
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:51,637
Order. Order in the court.

1369
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:54,908
I don't know why this has to be
the loudest court in the state.

1370
01:32:54,981 --> 01:32:57,449
Well, where's the district attorney?
Isn't this his case?

1371
01:32:57,517 --> 01:32:59,508
Yes, Your Honor.

1372
01:32:59,585 --> 01:33:02,782
I know he's the district attorney.
I know that.

1373
01:33:02,855 --> 01:33:05,585
Now, uh, what is all this?

1374
01:33:05,658 --> 01:33:09,458
Your Honor, in an effort to expedite matters
in this somewhat unusual hearing...

1375
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:13,090
we pray decisions on a number
of legal actions filed concurrently...

1376
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:15,999
all of which are components
of one basic familial disturbance.

1377
01:33:16,068 --> 01:33:19,868
Sounds like something the court of appeals
is going to reverse me on already.

1378
01:33:19,939 --> 01:33:23,204
If the bailiff will call the principals...

1379
01:33:23,276 --> 01:33:25,870
I will try to provide the court
with the various issues involved.

1380
01:33:25,945 --> 01:33:27,810
Nicholas Arden.

1381
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,281
<i>[District Attorney] Mr. Nicholas Arden,</i>
<i>a respected member of the local bar...</i>

1382
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:33,409
<i>is charged primarily with bigamy...</i>

1383
01:33:33,486 --> 01:33:36,944
but is also a party
to one or two other actions.

1384
01:33:37,023 --> 01:33:39,719
- Haven't I seen you here before?
- Well, yes, sir.

1385
01:33:39,792 --> 01:33:41,726
- [Bailiff] Mrs. Grace Arden.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1386
01:33:41,794 --> 01:33:45,059
It is Mrs. Grace Arden who brought
the charge of bigamy against Mr. Arden.

1387
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:47,326
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself, ma'am—

1388
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,493
a woman your age marrying this man.

1389
01:33:49,569 --> 01:33:53,061
Marrying him?
I happen to be his mother.

1390
01:33:53,139 --> 01:33:56,336
You mean, your own mother
charged you with bigamy?

1391
01:33:56,409 --> 01:33:59,572
I certainly did!

1392
01:33:59,645 --> 01:34:02,045
I hope you remember this
on Mother's Day.

1393
01:34:02,114 --> 01:34:04,412
<i>[Bailiff]</i>
<i>Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden.</i>

1394
01:34:04,484 --> 01:34:08,352
Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden
is one of the wives of the defendant...

1395
01:34:08,421 --> 01:34:10,753
and is asking for an annulment
of that marriage.

1396
01:34:10,823 --> 01:34:13,621
- You look familiar, young lady.
- I hope so, Your Honor.

1397
01:34:13,693 --> 01:34:16,890
- You married me.
- No, I married a little, short, fat—

1398
01:34:16,963 --> 01:34:19,158
- Oh, you—you mean to him.
- [BraceletJangles]

1399
01:34:19,232 --> 01:34:21,200
Oh, yes. I remember you now.

1400
01:34:21,267 --> 01:34:23,701
You're that do-it-yourself
head-shrinker.

1401
01:34:23,769 --> 01:34:27,261
<i>Please, Your Honor! Please!</i>
<i>May I object to that remark?</i>

1402
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:31,208
- Who are you?
- I happen to be Dr. Herman Schlick.

1403
01:34:31,277 --> 01:34:34,906
He's my analyst and my dearest friend.

1404
01:34:34,981 --> 01:34:37,916
And he's here to testify to my
emotional need for an annulment.

1405
01:34:37,984 --> 01:34:41,385
Yes, this man is completely unstable,
with definite schizoid tendencies—

1406
01:34:41,454 --> 01:34:44,946
Quiet. Nobody asked you
to testify, Doctor.

1407
01:34:45,024 --> 01:34:47,322
Just take your seat.

1408
01:34:47,393 --> 01:34:51,159
- Can he do that?
- It's all right, dear. Really!

1409
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:54,825
- Did you say she wanted an annulment?
- I most certainly do.

1410
01:34:54,901 --> 01:34:59,935
Now even my marriages
are being reversed on me.

1411
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,037
- What was wrong with it?
- [Whispering] Well, as usual in such cases—

1412
01:35:02,104 --> 01:35:04,504
- Un-kissed, you mean?
- Un-anything.

1413
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:07,406
[Chuckles]
Harvard man.

1414
01:35:08,777 --> 01:35:11,610
<i>[Bailiff]</i>
<i>Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden.</i>

1415
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,945
<i>[District Attorney] Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden,</i>
<i>who on the motion of Mr. Arden...</i>

1416
01:35:15,017 --> 01:35:18,612
<i>was declared legally dead, now petitions</i>
<i>the court to reverse that order.</i>

1417
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:23,090
Now, what bumbling idiot ever declared this
perfectly healthy-looking young woman dead?

1418
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:25,126
- Well, you did, Your Honor.
- Oh.

1419
01:35:25,194 --> 01:35:27,162
Uh, strike my last remark
from the record.

1420
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:29,959
When Mrs. Arden is declared
legally alive again...

1421
01:35:30,032 --> 01:35:32,899
she asks a divorce from Mr. Arden.

1422
01:35:32,968 --> 01:35:35,630
Well, if that's on my account,
you can save yourself the trouble.

1423
01:35:35,704 --> 01:35:38,730
It's no trouble. He's all yours.

1424
01:35:38,807 --> 01:35:42,573
I couldn't possibly
be less interested in the man.

1425
01:35:42,645 --> 01:35:45,113
Well, you seem to be back
in public domain, counselor.

1426
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,775
In the event Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden's
petition for annulment is denied...

1427
01:35:48,851 --> 01:35:51,046
she also asks a divorce from Mr. Arden.

1428
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,111
- On what grounds?
- Mental cruelty.

1429
01:35:53,188 --> 01:35:56,351
- Extreme mental cruelty.
- Oh, nonsense—

1430
01:35:56,425 --> 01:35:58,416
- Quiet.
- At the same time, Your Honor...

1431
01:35:58,494 --> 01:36:00,928
Mr. Arden is bringing countersuits
for divorce against...

1432
01:36:00,996 --> 01:36:03,794
Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden
and Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden.

1433
01:36:03,866 --> 01:36:06,494
Against me?

1434
01:36:06,569 --> 01:36:09,060
[Huffs]
How could you?

1435
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:11,629
- You're doing it to me.
- That's entirely different.

1436
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:15,199
<i>- [Gavel Bangs]</i>
- Your Honor, against Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden...

1437
01:36:15,277 --> 01:36:19,771
Mr. Arden names as corespondent,
Mr. Stephen Burkett.

1438
01:36:19,848 --> 01:36:23,978
Oh, Nicholas Arden, don't you ever
speak to me again as long as you live!

1439
01:36:24,053 --> 01:36:26,817
<i>Come back here, young woman.</i>
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1440
01:36:26,889 --> 01:36:30,222
I will not stay here
and be humiliated by this— this—

1441
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:33,284
You are going to stay here.
And don't argue with me.

1442
01:36:33,362 --> 01:36:35,091
I'll fine you $25 for contempt.

1443
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,632
How can you fine a corpse?
I'm still legally dead.

1444
01:36:40,703 --> 01:36:42,671
Then I'll declare you legally alive.

1445
01:36:42,738 --> 01:36:45,832
If you do that before the annulment,
Your Honor, I'll be guilty of bigamy.

1446
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:51,104
I should've played golf today,
arthritis and all.

1447
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,444
I'm also asking
for a restraining order...

1448
01:36:53,515 --> 01:36:57,212
against the publication of Mr. Burkett's
story in a national magazine...

1449
01:36:57,286 --> 01:37:00,278
on the grounds that it may
hold me up to public ridicule.

1450
01:37:00,356 --> 01:37:02,881
Oh, really? What is the story?

1451
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:05,483
- Well, I don't know it, Your Honor.
- You don't know it?

1452
01:37:05,561 --> 01:37:08,530
Well, no, sir. That's why I asked
for a subpoena for Mr. Burkett...

1453
01:37:08,597 --> 01:37:10,531
so he can tell his story in court.

1454
01:37:10,599 --> 01:37:12,692
- [Bailiff] Stephen Burkett!
- That isn't necessary!

1455
01:37:14,269 --> 01:37:16,829
Would you like to change places
with me, madam?

1456
01:37:16,905 --> 01:37:19,339
Your Honor, do we have to discuss it here?
It isn't "revelant."

1457
01:37:19,408 --> 01:37:21,376
- Relevant.
- R-Relevant.

1458
01:37:21,443 --> 01:37:23,843
It so happens I consider it
entirely "revelant"...

1459
01:37:23,912 --> 01:37:26,540
<i>and I consider you</i>
<i>entirely out of order.</i>

1460
01:37:26,615 --> 01:37:30,142
- Now don't tax my patience.
- Good morning, Your Honor.

1461
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,653
What's your story, Tarzan?

1462
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:35,713
Well, sir, Ellen and I were both
survivors of that plane crash.

1463
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:38,351
- Now, I'm a very strong swimmer—
- Never mind about your strength.

1464
01:37:38,427 --> 01:37:41,191
- Just get to the point.
- I'll do the questioning here, counselor.

1465
01:37:41,263 --> 01:37:43,561
Go on. After the crash,
what happened?

1466
01:37:43,632 --> 01:37:46,226
- Well, sir, when—
- Nothing happened.

1467
01:37:46,301 --> 01:37:49,634
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Can he do that?

1468
01:37:49,705 --> 01:37:51,696
He can do whatever he wants.
He's the judge.

1469
01:37:51,774 --> 01:37:53,833
That's right. Well?

1470
01:37:53,909 --> 01:37:56,935
Well, sir, I fished Ellen out of the water,
got her to that island...

1471
01:37:57,012 --> 01:37:59,344
where we stayed
until we were, uh, rescued.

1472
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,384
- Oh? How long was that?
- Five years.

1473
01:38:03,852 --> 01:38:06,582
You two were on that island
together for five years?

1474
01:38:06,655 --> 01:38:08,987
And three days.

1475
01:38:09,058 --> 01:38:12,824
- Were they alone?
- Oh, just the two of us,
Your Honor—Adam and Eve.

1476
01:38:12,895 --> 01:38:15,887
- Is that in the brief?
- It is not.

1477
01:38:16,965 --> 01:38:18,899
Oh, that should be in the brief.

1478
01:38:18,967 --> 01:38:21,401
- That's the most interesting part of the case.
<i>- [Bianca] Your Honor.</i>

1479
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:25,099
May I please have your permission
to get out of here before I explode?

1480
01:38:25,174 --> 01:38:27,506
I'd like to go home myself.

1481
01:38:27,576 --> 01:38:29,567
I'd like to tell my wife about this.

1482
01:38:29,645 --> 01:38:31,772
She thinks all my cases are dull.

1483
01:38:31,847 --> 01:38:33,781
This one's a doozy.

1484
01:38:35,951 --> 01:38:40,547
Now then, counselor,
we'll take first things first.

1485
01:38:40,622 --> 01:38:43,090
Uh, what is the first thing?

1486
01:38:43,158 --> 01:38:45,456
The charge of bigamy, Your Honor.

1487
01:38:45,527 --> 01:38:47,552
I have a precedent to cite.
The case of—

1488
01:38:47,629 --> 01:38:51,190
Never mind. I'm not interested in precedents.
My decisions are obvious.

1489
01:38:51,266 --> 01:38:53,666
When you married
the second Mrs. Arden...

1490
01:38:53,736 --> 01:38:56,569
the first Mrs. Arden
had been declared legally dead.

1491
01:38:56,638 --> 01:39:00,130
So I hereby dismiss the charge of bigamy.

1492
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:04,475
Now, as for the second matter,
the "kissless" bride—

1493
01:39:04,546 --> 01:39:06,912
I hereby annul that marriage.

1494
01:39:06,982 --> 01:39:08,973
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now may I leave?

1495
01:39:09,051 --> 01:39:12,509
As far as I'm concerned, you may all leave.
And the sooner the better.

1496
01:39:12,588 --> 01:39:14,556
But, Judge, I'm still legally dead!

1497
01:39:14,623 --> 01:39:19,287
Oh, yes. I hereby declare
Ellen Wagstaff Arden legally alive.

1498
01:39:19,361 --> 01:39:21,295
Does that mean
she's married to him again?

1499
01:39:21,363 --> 01:39:23,297
You're darn right she's
married to me again— Still!

1500
01:39:23,365 --> 01:39:26,266
- I didn't ask you. I asked the judge.
- Leave me out of this.

1501
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:29,463
- Case dismissed.
- Now wait, Your Honor. You can't do that.

1502
01:39:29,538 --> 01:39:32,564
- He can do whatever he wants. He's the judge.
- That's right.

1503
01:39:32,641 --> 01:39:35,269
- But you haven't heard the whole story.
- I don't have to hear it.

1504
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:37,972
I'll take your petition for divorce
under advisement and let you know later.

1505
01:39:38,046 --> 01:39:41,015
How much later? I'd like to know
when Ellen's free to marry me.

1506
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:44,075
- [Huffs]
- You hear that? Something
did happen on that island!

1507
01:39:44,153 --> 01:39:46,348
- Nothing happened!
- Ellen, tell them what—

1508
01:39:46,421 --> 01:39:48,821
- You keep quiet!
<i>- [Judge Bangs Gavel] Here! Here!</i>

1509
01:39:48,891 --> 01:39:51,655
<i>[Ellen] And you stop banging</i>
<i>that silly little hammer!</i>

1510
01:39:51,727 --> 01:39:53,786
What are you beefing about,
anyway, old buddy?

1511
01:39:53,862 --> 01:39:57,389
You and Ellen were married for only three years,
while she and I were together for five.

1512
01:39:57,466 --> 01:40:00,162
- So I'm claiming her on the basis of seniority.
- Ooh!

1513
01:40:00,235 --> 01:40:02,260
Well, you can have her.

1514
01:40:02,337 --> 01:40:04,271
- [Screams] Nicky!
- Baby.

1515
01:40:04,339 --> 01:40:06,273
See what you've done!

1516
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:09,538
Look, let's you and me cut out
to my hotel and talk it over, huh?

1517
01:40:09,611 --> 01:40:13,604
For five years you've been a big fat pain
in the neck, chasing me around that island...

1518
01:40:13,682 --> 01:40:17,015
and I told you I never wanna look
at that wolfish face of yours again!

1519
01:40:17,085 --> 01:40:19,986
You're a smug, egotistical,
strutting peacock!

1520
01:40:20,055 --> 01:40:22,182
Well, then, uh, how about lunch?

1521
01:40:33,869 --> 01:40:38,203
For five years you went through
this kind of treatment?

1522
01:40:38,273 --> 01:40:40,400
[Clicks Tongue]
My goodness.

1523
01:41:03,398 --> 01:41:05,491
- Where have you been?
- Where's Nicky?

1524
01:41:05,567 --> 01:41:07,558
I expected you back hours ago.

1525
01:41:07,636 --> 01:41:11,003
- Didn't he come home with you?
- After the way he stormed out of that courtroom?

1526
01:41:11,073 --> 01:41:13,064
I took a cab.

1527
01:41:14,676 --> 01:41:17,270
I've just made such a mess of everything.

1528
01:41:18,547 --> 01:41:20,481
And what about the children?

1529
01:41:20,549 --> 01:41:23,040
Well, they had to live without a mother
for a long time.

1530
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:25,450
I suppose they can do without
a father around the house.

1531
01:41:27,556 --> 01:41:30,719
Oh, Grace. How will I ever
explain to them?

1532
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:35,627
You just march yourself out there
and tell your children who you are.

1533
01:41:35,697 --> 01:41:38,063
Go on.

1534
01:42:11,366 --> 01:42:13,664
<i>[Jenny]</i>
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

1535
01:42:20,409 --> 01:42:22,775
Hi, Mommy.
[Laughs]

1536
01:42:32,821 --> 01:42:37,315
<i>Well, isn't it about time somebody</i>
<i>started kissing somebody around here?</i>

1537
01:42:39,127 --> 01:42:41,118
Oh, Nicky!

1538
01:42:50,072 --> 01:42:52,563
- Hey!
- It's my turn.
