3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,180
Everything looks so yummy!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,060
How about I buy something for you?

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,620
Where'd it go?

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:21,780
It's fine! I can still afford this.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,890
How much?

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,770
Six for thirty.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,840
Where are you from?

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,890
Korea.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, what a lovely pair of newlyweds!

12
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,600
What?

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,900
This is free.

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,750
Oh, thank you!

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,590
<i>You're welcome.</i>

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,260
Thank you.

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,010
It's so good!

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,270
Thank you!

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,190
Bye bye.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,320
Episode 15

21
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,660
What is this?

22
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,940
Excuse me. What is this?

23
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,000
This is a dragon amulet that
will bring good fortune.

24
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,670
It's a lucky dragon amulet.

25
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,660
Oh... an amulet.

26
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,160
Let's buy one.

27
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,660
My wallet!

28
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,490
What should I do?

29
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,270
Wait for me here.

30
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,840
Oh, Sunbae!

31
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,250
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,560
Can I borrow your guitar?

33
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,310
Why? You want to play?

34
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,660
I'm sorry. I will pay you with my egg tarts.

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,450
Can I borrow your guitar... just once?

36
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,650
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,120
- Thank you.
- Sure.

38
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,030
<i>When I look toward you,
a thought suddenly appears.</i>

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,730
<i>Some day, I'll wait until the sky is clear,</i>

40
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,480
<i>Just as it was on the day you left.</i>

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,260
<i>You will quietly return to my side.</i>

42
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,970
<i>The you in my heart.</i>

43
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,840
<i>Can you really never see me again?</i>

44
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:50,670
<i>I'm really such an idiot,
you're the only one in my heart.</i>

45
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,680
<i>You, who have eyes for someone else,</i>

46
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,370
<i>You probably don't know how I feel.</i>

47
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,610
<i>Your day probably will not include me.</i>

48
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,750
<i>Not even your memories.</i>

49
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,820
<i>It's only me, the one watching you,</i>

50
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,300
<i>Who is silently crying.</i>

51
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:32,350
<i>Watching the shape of your
back is a kind of happiness to me.</i>

52
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:43,880
<i>Even though, to the very end,
you do not understand my heart.</i>

53
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,700
<i>When I want to see you,</i>

54
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,880
<i>At times when I really can't bear it,</i>

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,190
<i>The words "I love you"
are always lingering on my lips,</i>

56
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,550
<i>I am alone, crying for you.</i>

57
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,460
<i>I am alone, missing for you.</i>

58
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,600
This is more than enough, right?

59
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,520
This rascal's probably acting up
now that we're in Macau.

60
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,910
Nope. I'll have to walk barefoot.

61
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,870
Let's go.

62
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,680
I'll give you a piggy-back ride.

63
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,790
What?

64
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
Or should I carry you?

65
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,720
No... that...

66
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,930
Okay.

67
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

68
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
What is Sunbae thanking me for?

69
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,330
I should be the one saying thank you.

70
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,630
This is the first time in my life,

71
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,520
that I've earned my own money.

72
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,400
Right.

73
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,580
Because of you, I've experienced
many things for the first time.

74
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,550
So..

75
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,580
Thank you.

76
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,870
<i>{\a6}Bye bye, never say goodbye,</i>

77
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:08,490
<i>{\a6}Although I cannot grab hold of you.</i>

78
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,900
Let's just go back.

79
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:14,360
<i>{\a6}I need you. I cannot say anything.</i>

80
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,130
Just a bit longer.

81
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:21,460
<i>{\a6}I want you.
Even if it's just wishing and wishing.</i>

82
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,190
<i>{\a}When I want to see you,</i>

83
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,460
<i>{\a6}At times when I really can't bear it,</i>

84
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:37,840
<i>{\a6}The words "I love you"
are always lingering on my lips,</i>

85
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,010
<i>{\a6}I am alone, missing for you.</i>

86
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,210
<i>{\a6}In the days when I really miss you,</i>

87
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,470
<i>{\a6}The days when my heart aches,</i>

88
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,140
Young master.

89
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,740
<i>{\a6}The words "I miss you"
always linger at my lips.</i>

90
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,030
Let's go.

91
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,850
<i>{\a6}I am alone, crying for you.</i>

92
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,080
<i>{\a6}I am alone, missing for you.</i>

93
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,150
<i>{\a6}Baby I love you.</i>

94
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,140
<i>{\a6}I'm waiting for you.</i>

95
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,080
You didn't lock the door.

96
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,990
Geum Jan Di.

97
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,270
Hurry up and come out.

98
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,360
Are you planning on spending
the entire day in there?

99
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,870
Okay.

100
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,090
Then I'm going out for a bit first.

101
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,740
I'm going out.

102
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,610
Come out and eat.

103
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,620
[Memory erased.]

104
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,870
[Memory cleared.]

105
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,380
[18:00 flight to Seoul]

106
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,560
[Gu Jun Pyo.]

107
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,820
First?

108
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,660
This is first class?

109
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,770
Yes.

110
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,600
So expensive.

111
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,630
I can just take the normal one.

112
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,230
Hurry and return this.

113
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,090
Normal?

114
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,670
You mean... economy class?

115
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,070
I think it's too cramped for my legs,
so I can't ride in economy class.

116
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,280
What?

117
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,670
Long... they are long.

118
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,140
I can ride in economy class.

119
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,000
It's so hard to see Jae Kyung.

120
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,490
It's because that child is ever illusive.

121
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,790
We just verified it. It seems like she's
on her way back from Hong Kong.

122
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,930
We're truly sorry.

123
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,290
Making you wait so long when you're so busy.

124
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,900
Ahh, it's nothing.

125
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,430
What's more important than
letting the children meet?

126
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,920
Isn't that right, Jun Pyo?

127
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,560
Gu Jun Pyo.

128
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,290
Yes?

129
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,110
Ahh, yes, of course.

130
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,590
What's wrong?

131
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,900
The Singapore branch needs
the Young Master immediately.

132
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,160
What kind of occasion is this?

133
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,770
The prime minister...

134
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,330
<i>It's fine.</i>

135
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,280
<i>They'll be able to meet very soon.</i>

136
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,550
For an entrepreneur,
what is more important than business?

137
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,280
Go ahead.

138
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,600
Please excuse me.

139
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,610
This is...

140
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,660
Do you like them?

141
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,990
What is this?

142
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,730
I always wanted to use the first
money that I earned on my own

143
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,340
to buy you something.

144
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,450
Sunbae.

145
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,920
Why have you come?

146
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,490
I am not under any obligation to answer you.

147
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,660
You, on the other hand, why have you come?

148
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,800
Do you think you have the right to ask...

149
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,820
A question like that?

150
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,060
Yoon Ji Hoo!

151
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,410
Because I consider you my friend,
I backed off.

152
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,340
Because she's my friend's girl,
I stopped thinking about it.

153
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,230
<i>And even to the very end,</i>

154
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,350
I still gave you a chance.

155
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,000
From now on, I won't yield anymore.

156
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,680
You rascal.

157
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,340
Enough!

158
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,800
Why have you come?

159
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,100
Do you have something to say?

160
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,540
Okay.

161
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,940
I understand.

162
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm leaving.

163
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,840
<i>{\a6}I'll be waiting for you.</i>

164
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,700
<i>{\a6}I'll be waiting for you.</i>

165
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:42,230
<i>{\a6}I no longer want you
to see my painful tears.</i>

166
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,580
<i>{\a6}You let me know.</i>

167
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,350
<i>{\a6}A love like lies.</i>

168
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:58,640
<i>{\a6}I won't give it up.
Because it's you.</i>

169
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:20,830
<i>{\a6}Please look at me, like those stars.</i>

170
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,630
Young Master.

171
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:28,900
<i>{\a6}Can you become the man in my heart?</i>

172
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
Stand up.

173
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,740
<i>{\a6}I'll be waiting for you.</i>

174
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,580
<i>{\a6}I'll be waiting for you.</i>

175
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:45,020
<i>{\a6}I no longer want you
to see my painful tears.</i>

176
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,540
<i>{\a6}You let me know.</i>

177
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,350
<i>{\a6}A love like lies.</i>

178
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:02,110
<i>{\a6}I won't give it up.
Because it's you.</i>

179
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,850
Come. Order up on the congee!

180
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,330
Please enjoy!

181
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,670
Miss.

182
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,190
This isn't abalone congee.

183
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,040
Oh, I'm sorry, madam.

184
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,270
I'll bring you some abalone
congee immediately.

185
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,350
<i>I'm really very sorry.</i>

186
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,270
I'm very sorry.

187
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,090
Sorry.

188
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,560
Ga Eul.

189
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,340
I must be really dumb.

190
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:14,470
I should get all my energy together
and figure out how I'll continue my life.

191
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,100
But I'm always creating trouble like this.

192
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,410
Jan Di.

193
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,290
Go deliver, take-out.

194
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,390
I'll go. I'll deliver it for her.

195
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,400
Where is it?

196
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,870
Jan Di. You go.

197
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,180
Once you deliver it, until he finishes it,
don't budge a single step from that place.

198
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,580
Then bring the bowl and
the chopsticks, understand?

199
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,580
Before he finishes, don't even think
about coming back to the shop.

200
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,080
We're done.

201
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,420
<i>Please wait just a moment.</i>

202
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,240
Okay, there's no problem
with your blood pressure.

203
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,450
<i>Come... say ahhh.</i>

204
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,990
The girl standing outside.

205
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,860
Me?

206
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,830
Don't just stand there. Come in and help.

207
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,110
Aren't you going to come in?

208
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,910
Can you not see that
the patients are waiting?

209
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,540
Okay.

210
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,000
You must be very cold.
Drink some hot water.

211
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,310
<i>Thank you, miss, thank you.</i>

212
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,110
- Yes, please drink some.
- Okay, okay.

213
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,520
Thank you so much!

214
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,700
- Thank you.
- Yes.

215
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,850
Say something!

216
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:09,790
{\a6}<i>Whenever I'm tired, lucky in my life</i>

217
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,030
{\a6}<i>You come by my side like a dream.</i>

218
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,560
{\a6}<i>Whenever I'm sad, lucky in my dream.</i>

219
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,830
Look at this! This! What is this?

220
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,590
What is this?

221
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:29,660
{\a6}<i>You always warmly surround me.</i>

222
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,860
Look, no more!

223
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:36,160
{\a6}<i>No matter when,
I will always smile like this.</i>

224
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:42,180
{\a6}<i>No matter how many trials
there are in this world, I'll definitely</i>

225
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,330
{\a6}<i>Never let you see my tears.</i>

226
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:53,190
{\a6}<i>Even if you don't understand my heart.</i>

227
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,300
{\a6}<i>Even if you're far away,</i>

228
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,670
{\a6}<i>I'll still be happy
because of your smile.</i>

229
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,570
{\a6}<i>Can you take a step closer to me?</i>

230
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:14,060
{\a6}<i>Can you take a step closer to me?</i>

231
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,640
This girl! If you want to sleep,
you should go home to sleep!

232
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,150
Oh, this.

233
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,380
Until you finish this, I can't go home.

234
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,880
Please enjoy.

235
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,150
Uh... Grandpa.

236
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,900
What exactly do you do?

237
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,720
How do you know our master?

238
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,790
Grandpa, you ARE a doctor, right?

239
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,080
You're not perhaps... practicing unlicensed?

240
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,720
Do I look like a quack?

241
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,830
Is that what you mean?

242
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,480
No, no... kind of.

243
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,510
<i>Doctor Grandpa... my stomach!</i>

244
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,840
<i>Doctor! My stomach hurts!</i>

245
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,870
- Come, come, Come, stand up.
- My stomach hurts! I'm going to die!

246
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,940
- Just bear it for a bit. You're here now.
- My stomach hurts.

247
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,160
Bear it a little while longer,
a little while.

248
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,020
There are guests here too?

249
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,940
Sunbae.

250
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,880
Here.

251
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,160
Are you extremely happy about something?

252
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,260
How could you tell?

253
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,170
It's written all over here.

254
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,300
<i>Hold her hand! Hold on to her hand!</i>

255
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,540
<i>Okay.</i>

256
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,150
<i>Push once more.</i>

257
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,830
We're almost there. One more time.

258
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,570
Okay, okay, okay.

259
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,910
<i>Okay, that did it.</i>

260
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,410
<i>Okay, okay. Good, good.</i>

261
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
Come, you've worked hard.

262
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,470
<i>I gave birth to a child.</i>

263
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,790
<i>You did very well. Very well!</i>

264
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,790
<i>My baby is here.</i>

265
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,770
Pretty, huh?

266
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,390
<i>My entire body was trembling.</i>

267
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,930
<i>As if I gained insight to a world that
I hadn't been known to me until yesterday.</i>

268
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,780
<i>For the first time, whether
it was Jun Pyo, swimming..</i>

269
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,130
<i>I couldn't think of anything.</i>

270
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,550
Other people might say I'm crazy.

271
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,930
A dummy like me, even if I say
I want to be a doctor,

272
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,890
people would still laugh at me, no?

273
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,560
Geum Jan Di...

274
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,780
You really have gone crazy.

275
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,080
You really are crazy.

276
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,110
You've found something that you'd
be willing to be called "crazy" for.

277
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,490
Do you know how difficult that is?

278
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,970
What does it matter what other people say?

279
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,660
When did Geum Jan Di started
to care about that too?

280
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,900
Sunbae.

281
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,680
If you want to do it, then go do it.

282
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,260
No matter how many years it takes?

283
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,270
No matter how many years it takes.

284
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,680
To Jan Di's newly-discovered dream..

285
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,960
Cheers!

286
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,100
Cheers!

287
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,550
This is only the beginning of
Shinhwa Group's leap forward.

288
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,080
Please look forward to it.

289
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,870
Jan Di?

290
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,250
I was right!

291
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,800
I heard you went to Macau

292
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,230
Truthfully...

293
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,030
I needed to clear things up with Gu Jun Pyo

294
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,540
so that I can continue living my life.

295
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,190
I think it was a good thing I went.

296
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,330
I've organized myself now.

297
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:50,530
I wanted you to be near our Jun Pyo...

298
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,450
That's unfortunate

299
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,670
Can you still think of me as an
older sister, despite Jun Pyo?

300
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,700
Yes, of course.

301
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,730
What happened?

302
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,180
Why are you a star and me a moon?

303
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:34,190
Geum Jan Di is a moon that can never
fall apart from the star Jun Pyo.

304
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,560
Even if something happens,

305
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,640
I'm not going to let this moon go.

306
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,530
<i>It's okay.</i>

307
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,430
Don't hold it in and just cry.

308
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,650
Just pour it out.

309
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,160
Unnie, I lied.

310
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,150
I'm not fine.

311
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,070
I went because I wanted to see Gu Jun Pyo.

312
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,740
But he's changed into a
completely different person...

313
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,370
that I can't believe it.

314
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,400
Jan Di.

315
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,870
<i>Jan Di.</i>

316
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,660
<i>Thank you.</i>

317
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,160
I'm really happy that you've told me this.

318
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,800
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

319
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,580
Jun Pyo will definitely come back.

320
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,090
So don't give him up like this.

321
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,170
Believe me and give him another chance.

322
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,510
Can you do that for me?

323
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,330
Ga Eul!

324
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,540
[As the Shinhwa Group Executive Director
Gu Jun Pyo meets his 20th birthday]

325
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,840
[we will be holding an
elegant birthday party.]

326
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,810
{\a6}[We ask that you to attend
and have your presence shine.]

327
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,510
{\a6}[Place: H Hotel Grand Ballroom Hall.]

328
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,620
Jun Pyo sunbae's birthday party?

329
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,610
Yeah.

330
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,270
You want me to take Jan Di here?

331
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,530
Why? Why should I do that?

332
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:07,400
Jun Pyo sunbae, no that person,
dumped Jan Di.

333
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,140
There's just something that bothers me.

334
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,680
I just want to check up on it.

335
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,550
If something wrong happens,
it'll be Jan Di who'll be getting hurt.

336
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,060
Ga Eul.

337
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,930
Listen carefully.

338
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,780
If Jun Pyo leaving Jan Di is all an act,
then that's fortunate.

339
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,540
Even if he was being sincere,
it was something that Jan Di needed.

340
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,750
It's not just killing someone twice?

341
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,130
If it's a person you have to erase,

342
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,010
then it's better not to painfully
keep him in your heart.

343
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,570
Didn't I tell you that last time?

344
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,300
What's all this?

345
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:09,290
If you're going out to the battlefield,
you need weapons.

346
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,330
I don't want to. Why should I?

347
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,480
Are you seriously not going
to see him again?

348
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,690
<i>Are you just going to end it like this?</i>

349
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,330
<i>He came back to Seoul.</i>

350
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,580
It's his birthday. We can just
congratulate him and leave.

351
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,880
Do you really have nothing to say to him?

352
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:49,550
The part that hurts the most
isn't him ignoring me...

353
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,390
or not holding onto me until the end.

354
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,730
I didn't even get to say thank you.

355
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,710
I didn't even tell him I liked him.

356
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,370
The fact that I can't tell him that now.

357
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,430
Welc...

358
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,070
Hello, Geum Jan Di.

359
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,010
Hello. Maybe I help you?

360
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,150
Today is Young Master Jun Pyo's
birthday party.

361
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,640
Did Gu Jun Pyo send you here?

362
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,730
No.

363
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,900
Madame President eagerly
awaits your presence.

364
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,690
Madame President?

365
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,380
It's F4! They're really handsome.

366
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,590
You came.

367
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,140
I didn't want to run away so
I managed to come with my pride

368
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,330
But I feel like I shouldn't have come.

369
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,320
Geum Jan Di, you should at
least get something to eat.

370
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:02,080
If you cowardly leave by yourself,
Ga Eul will be fidgety all night.

371
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,950
Geum Jan Di, aren't you all about loyalty?

372
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,490
Aren't I right, Ga Eul?

373
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,100
For everyone who came tonight
to congratulate me,

374
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:11,070
my son Jun Pyo, and Shinhwa Group,
I welcome you wholeheartedly.

375
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,790
As you know, the reason why we've
managed to get by the toughest of times

376
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,010
is due to everyone who is here today.

377
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,460
Until the day Shinhwa becomes
the number one group,

378
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:39,080
I hope that we will still have your
undivided attention and interest.

379
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,700
Now I will introduce
today's man of the hour.

380
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:47,830
Shinhwa Group's future, my son Gu Jun Pyo.

381
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:28,720
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

382
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,840
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

383
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:37,290
<i>Happy birthday dear Jun Pyo.</i>

384
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,460
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

385
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,690
Are you okay?

386
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,160
I think I should go soon.

387
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,000
I shouldn't have come in the first place.

388
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,650
It's been awhile, Geum Jan Di.

389
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,780
Thanks for responding to my invite.

390
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,630
Invite?

391
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,840
Since you are here,

392
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,980
is it okay if I ask you to sing
a birthday song for Jun Pyo?

393
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,390
What?

394
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,230
I know you as a smart young lady

395
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,940
who has been raised by excellent
parents with the right education.

396
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,670
It won't be impolite for me to ask you
to play a piano piece, would it?

397
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,990
That's impossible.

398
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,400
Can Geum Jan Di play piano?

399
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,710
She probably can't right?

400
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,030
I was wondering why she invited her.

401
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,470
She sure is something.

402
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,830
We were just about to...

403
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,760
I'll do it.

404
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,400
<i>You invited me.</i>

405
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,850
It's the least I can do for this meal.

406
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,740
Everyone, Geum Jan Di from Shinhwa High
will be performing for us.

407
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:16,620
Can we give her a round of applause?

408
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:12,300
<i>The moment you stood by my side,</i>

409
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,880
<i>I love that look in your eye.</i>

410
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:25,830
<i>Yesterday I cried but today because of you,</i>

411
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:33,230
<i>Tomorrow I'll be happy.</i>

412
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,450
<i>It's not...</i>

413
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,740
<i>It's not your face...</i>

414
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,290
<i>It's not your style...</i>

415
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:04,920
<i>All I needed was your soft loving.</i>

416
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:22,550
<i>To forget all of my past...</i>

417
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:30,210
<i>Now I can't do anything without you...</i>

418
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,790
<i>I only know...</i>

419
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,470
<i>I only know about love.</i>

420
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:42,530
I think I might have ruined the atmosphere
by asking for too much.

421
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:47,500
It shows that people should take
notice of their situation and know

422
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,140
when and when not to present themselves.

423
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,500
I apologize instead.

424
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,640
Everyone, you've waited for a long time.

425
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,440
Now I will make the most
important announcement,

426
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,480
one that holds the future of Shinhwa Group.

427
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,730
Important announcement?

428
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,790
At this moment,

429
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,410
the young lady who is my
son Gu Jun Pyo's fiance?

430
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,820
and will be the future head lady of
Shinhwa group is here in this room.

431
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,130
What? Fiance!?

432
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,010
What is that Witch saying?

433
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:30,730
Everyone, I'll introduce her to you.

434
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,500
The heiress to the worldwide
investment company,

435
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:37,070
JK Group, Han Jae Kyung.

436
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,620
<i>Let me go! Let me...</i>

437
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,210
Don't you know I hate this kind of thing?

438
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,440
<i>What are you talking about engagement?</i>

439
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,940
<i>Let me go!</i>

440
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,300
I'll go myself. Hey!

441
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,310
Shoes?

442
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,190
You!

443
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:04,260
Engaged?

444
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,590
Can't believe it's JK Group.

445
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,610
It's so like Jun Pyo's mother.

446
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,820
Is it that great?

447
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,850
It's Korean-based, but it's an investment
company that contributes to ones in America.

448
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,960
It's not only investment,
but also oil fields and resorts.

449
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,230
It's a global company that has everything.

450
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,280
I should have known when they were in Macau.

451
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,150
I thought you guys were just
a bunch of trouble makers,

452
00:52:27,151 --> 00:52:28,651
but you analyzed it correctly.

453
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,590
Now do you understand?

454
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,560
The spot to become Shinhwa Group's
head lady has to be filled

455
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,870
with that kind of reputation, or nothing.

456
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,310
What kind of scheme do you have now?

457
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:48,730
What's this sudden engagement?

458
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,230
And why are you here?

459
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:55,510
Do you think I wanted to come here?

460
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,230
I invited her.

461
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,940
What?

462
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,300
It's an introduction to
the wife of the future.

463
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:06,360
As a friend, she should come to
congratulate you, don't you think?

464
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,510
Are you stupid?

465
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,150
<i>Where do you think this is that you
just show because you were called?</i>

466
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,360
Jun Pyo.

467
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,960
Don't do this here,
but go somewhere and talk.

468
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,580
I have nothing to say to Gu Jun Pyo.

469
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:23,950
You're finally beginning to
understand the situation.

470
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:28,830
What would you have to say to a
man who has a fiance?

471
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:32,000
Um... about that engagement...

472
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,880
It's not like this is some surprise show...

473
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,220
Are you being serious?

474
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,270
I'm sorry for surprising you,

475
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,090
but it has already been discussed
with your parents.

476
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,720
But this is the first time
I'm hearing about it.

477
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,240
Hey shoes!

478
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,050
Be quiet.

479
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,210
<i>And you.</i>

480
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,510
You have nothing to say to me?

481
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:56,740
<i>Well, I do.</i>

482
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,180
So just shut your mouth and follow me.

483
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,900
You still don't know after
suffering that much?

484
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,430
It's about time for you know that
it's a trap when the Witch calls you out.

485
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,660
<i>Hey wait...</i>

486
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,890
How come there's no growth in your learning
abilities even when you're one year older?

487
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,970
How could you come so easily when the Witch,
not even me, called you out?

488
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,810
Hey wait!

489
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,210
Isn't it obvious that she was
trying to torture us both?

490
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:28,200
I don't understand what kind of girl
falls into every trap laid out for her.

491
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,620
Hey! CURLY HAIR!

492
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,190
What? Curly hair? Now you're...

493
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,250
Do you understand that now
you have to get rid

494
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,440
of your false expectations and hopes?

495
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:12,420
I'm glad that there was a good
result in inviting you today.

496
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,760
Then...

497
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,100
Jan Di.

498
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,470
Is that person...

499
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,150
What's wrong with him?

500
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,860
Is he really marrying her?

501
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,980
I'll take Ga Eul home.

502
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,640
Ji Hoo.

503
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,570
Let's meet later at the lounge.

504
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,230
I'll try to figure out what's
just happened until then.

505
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,690
Why are you here?

506
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,490
You dragged me here.

507
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:04,300
So why did you get dragged here?

508
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,240
I knew that you were a weird
person since Macau,

509
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,890
but you really are strange punk!

510
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,150
What? Punk?

511
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,300
If you have eyes, take a look.

512
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,800
I'm wearing a backless dress
in the middle of winter

513
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,990
And I'm getting dragged everywhere barefoot.

514
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,890
Shouldn't you be saying sorry first?

515
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,930
So who told you to follow me?

516
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:25,410
Who are you saying followed you?

517
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,940
Okay then.

518
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,940
Keep going your way then.

519
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,170
If you follow me again, I'll kill you.

520
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,160
That little... HEY!

521
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:43,110
What's this? Hey!

522
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,280
Say you're sorry, you jerk!

523
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,540
Aren't you going to come down?

524
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,540
Apologize! Hurry!

525
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,700
Apologize!

526
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,360
This crazy monkey!
You better come down.

527
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,960
What did you just do?

528
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:04,610
But... why is your face so red.

529
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,850
What's this...? Do you...

530
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,320
Shut up and go away.

531
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,000
Why does this girl keep bothering me
after I told her to leave me alone?

532
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,350
What?

533
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,060
Give me some money.

534
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:19,270
What money?

535
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,680
I need to at least catch a cab.

536
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,430
Don't you see that because of
you I came out with nothing?

537
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,440
I don't have any.

538
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:30,630
I don't have any money.

539
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,340
Your cell phone.

540
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,270
Cell phone?

541
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,780
Hey!

542
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,650
What are you doing?
Where do you think you're touching?

543
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:43,370
What's wrong with you?

544
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:46,750
What's this?

545
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,570
Let me go.

546
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,970
Do you know who I am?

547
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,920
Are you okay, Miss?

548
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,770
Let me go!

549
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,310
Are you in that much shock?

550
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,850
Huh?

551
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,620
Jun Pyo's engagement.

552
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,360
No.

553
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:50,180
It doesn't matter if he's engaged or not.

554
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,490
You know that better than I do.

555
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,680
Jun Pyo probably didn't know either.

556
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,750
If it was true about the engagement,

557
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,880
He would have at least told us about it.

558
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,180
No...

559
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,860
That girl...

560
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,030
is someone Gu Jun Pyo knows.

561
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,840
How do you know?

562
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:23,890
I've seen her before, in Macau.

563
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,270
I'll be going now.

564
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,240
Geum Jan Di.

565
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,440
The thing I told Jun Pyo in Macau.

566
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,230
I know.

567
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:54,570
It was just something you said
because you were mad at him.

568
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,160
You're right.

569
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:11,580
Nothing's wrong with me.

570
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,750
Don't worry.

571
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,100
Geum Jan Di.

572
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:22,140
Sometimes the things you
see might not be real.

573
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,760
Some things...

574
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,760
Are visible only through faith.

575
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,510
I'll just be going.

576
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,150
I can go alone.

577
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,130
Sleep well.

578
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:49,230
Good bye.

579
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:30,020
Yoon Ji Hoo,

580

- I found him!
- Why is that girl here?

587
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,560
It was a piece that Queen Elizabeth liked.

588
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:09,830
Thank You! If I use this as our Leon's dish,
he'll definitely be really happy!

589
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:13,430
<i>I've seen plenty of women before, but it's
the first time I've seen someone like her.</i>

590
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,420
Now let's get our emergency plan going.

591
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:16,920
Emergency plan?

592
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:18,050
It's interesting.

593
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,000
What is?

594
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,640
The way you do everything wholeheartedly.

595
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,600
Ji Hoo!

596
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:26,290
Ji Hoo!

597
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:28,310
What?

598
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,960
You're doing what with Yi Jung?

599
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:32,970
Date.

600
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,340
I bet you don't know that Yi Jung's
nickname is 5-second kill.

601
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:37,250
5-second kill?

602
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,400
NO!

603
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,280
So what do you want me to do?

604
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,650
Jun Pyo is in the hotel right now?

605
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:49,430
<i>I keep getting greedy... What do I do?</i>
