{0}{100}Battlefield Earth - 1CD Subtitle - 23,976fps - English
{3160}{3204}The entire tribe must not|be endangered. . .
{3209}{3267}. . .because of the defiance of|one person.
{3272}{3307}You must forget about him.
{3312}{3394}He was a wild spirit and this was|always to be his fate.
{3399}{3465}You talk as if he's already dead
{3623}{3703}Even if he does survive this time,|he's a greener. . .
{3708}{3768}. . .so set your sights elsewhere|for a husband.
{3773}{3833}I'll never set my sights elsewhere.
{4657}{4727}-This is all the medicine I could find.|-I'm sorry.
{4737}{4801}The gods took your father|in the night.
{5397}{5491}As long as we stay here, there'll|never be enough to eat. Never.
{5508}{5596}There may be other places|we could live where food is plentiful.
{5601}{5683}All it takes is one demon to follow|you back from the forbidden land.
{5688}{5727}Then we'd all be struck down.
{5733}{5768}Have you ever seen one?
{5773}{5804}Have you?
{5809}{5856}Has anyone here ever seen one?
{5867}{5891}A demon?
{5901}{5929}A monster!?
{5934}{5963}A beast!?
{6051}{6085}The stories are true.
{6115}{6152}The gods used to live here.
{6174}{6260}They watched over and protected man,|but man grew selfish. . .
{6265}{6316}. . .and cruel. So the gods left. . .
{6321}{6381}. . .allowing the demons|to descend from the sky.
{6511}{6599}As survivors, we must dedicate|our lives to pleasing the gods. . .
{6605}{6695}. . .so that one day they will come back|and drive away the demons.
{6713}{6788}That is our fate.
{6839}{6887}Only if you believe in fate.
{7449}{7487}I'm sorry. I can't take you.
{7492}{7540}I can't handle myself|as well as a man?
{7545}{7591}-No.|-You arrogant greener.
{7596}{7665}You can handle yourself|better than most men. . .
{7670}{7732}. . .which is why you need|to help the village.
{7861}{7943}Your mother gave this to me|before she died.
{7949}{8003}She hoped it'd be passed|to your children.
{8103}{8132}It's for good luck.
{8349}{8406}Don't let anything happen|to you out there.
{9450}{9470}Easy!
{9618}{9639}Easy!
{10283}{10334}So you're the beast|we're all afraid of.
{10967}{11006}Not a lot of meat on a dragon.
{11191}{11238}You have been fortunate in the hunt.
{11243}{11294}I hope you thanked the gods.
{11326}{11394}-A nonbeliever.|-I believe what I can see.
{11447}{11521}A nonbeliever, huh?|You from the caves?
{11526}{11587}Probably never seen a god.|Would you like to?
{11592}{11674}-What do you know about gods?|-We've seen gods. Rock and I.
{11680}{11717}You lying thieves.
{11818}{11844}Wait a minute.
{11870}{11910}Wait a minute, we're hunting.
{11915}{11965}No time to show you gods with no food.
{11970}{12055}We need food. We must hunt.|Nonbeliever.
{12142}{12167}Wait.
{12383}{12428}First you show me the god.
{12449}{12484}Then we eat.
{12673}{12698}Look.
{12714}{12755}Frozen ones.
{12760}{12846}The way to the great god village|is marked by these frozen ones.
{12864}{12949}When the gods left this world,|they ordered man not to look at them.
{12957}{13049}Those that disobeyed were|frozen in place for all of eternity.
{13055}{13128}When the gods lived here|they could fly through the air.
{13148}{13241}They'd drive chariots in front|of special caves with golden arches.
{13254}{13278}Golden.
{13283}{13345}And the food would magically appear.
{13350}{13376}Magic.
{13382}{13410}Here!
{13435}{13537}The gods weren't allowed to fall|in love with mortal women.
{13547}{13585}This one did. . .
{13590}{13662}. . .and was left behind,|frozen as punishment.
{13765}{13798}Are you sure this was a god?
{13804}{13863}I thought you said you believe|what you can see.
{14138}{14165}If you need proof. . .
{14170}{14262}. . .when the sun goes down, you can see|the rest of the gods in the sky.
{14271}{14312}They're the bright lights.
{14366}{14438}The evil beasts hunt in the dark.|We need to find shelter.
{14443}{14490}There's a cave over here.
{14622}{14716}Look at those poor bastards.|They really angered the gods.
{14723}{14749}Carlo.
{14766}{14797}Let's eat.
{15156}{15194}Go. Go.
{15571}{15598}What's a "greener"?
{15604}{15655}The grass is greener|on the other side.
{15673}{15759}Always looking for something better,|something out there.
{15764}{15794}Maybe she was right.
{15918}{15950}God stone.
{15986}{16013}Sharp.
{16047}{16095}No, you keep it. You keep it.
{16111}{16194}Where we're from, a good woman|is a hard thing to find.
{16199}{16280}So if you were stupid enough|to leave a good woman behind. . .
{16285}{16374}. . .why don't you tell me where she is|so I can go get her for myself?
{16379}{16403}No!
{17416}{17474}Forget about me.|Get out of here. I can't move!
{17803}{17826}No!
{17931}{17967}Oh, heavenly gods!
{21835}{21880}Don't breathe the air!
{21893}{21917}It's poison!
{22043}{22085}My chest is on fire!
{22311}{22363}It helps you breathe. Take it!
{22368}{22399}I can't!
{22501}{22543}Get off my brother.
{24191}{24234}-What's he saying?|-Don't know.
{26292}{26331}Who's responsible for allowing|him to run around?
{26337}{26357}He shot the wrangler.
{26463}{26556}I'm a little pressed for time.|Save the going-away jokes for later.
{26561}{26608}No joke, sir. I swear.
{26613}{26673}The man-animal|got a hold of this gun.
{26690}{26715}Really?
{26746}{26775}Show me.
{26799}{26819}Sir?
{26927}{26954}Reach for the gun.
{26959}{27000}But, sir, I might get shot.
{27006}{27086}Sure, you might. And I might|suddenly grow a third arm!
{27091}{27123}But it shot the wrangler.
{27129}{27201}Any report filed today|still has my name on it. . .
{27207}{27296}. . .and you are out of your skull-bone|if you think I'm going to write. . .
{27301}{27384}. . . "shot by a man-animal" as the|cause of death unless I see it!
{27389}{27447}If I obey your command,|I may get killed.
{27452}{27517}If you don't, it's a certainty|you will be killed.
{27542}{27569}Reach for the gun.
{27848}{27908}Well, I'll be damned.
{29887}{29956}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30011}{30058}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30617}{30672}It is a pleasure to see you,|Your Excellency.
{30677}{30757}I would be honored to expedite|your clearance through security.
{30762}{30844}Please, call me Zete.|Does all of Earth look like this?
{30849}{30899}I'm afraid so, sir.
{30914}{31019}Pathetic. All the green|and the blue sky.
{31026}{31115}They told me this planet was ugly,|but this is one of the ugliest. . .
{31120}{31189}-. . .in the entire universe.|-I couldn't agree more.
{31194}{31300}I hate these puny, undersized planets.|The gravity is so different.
{31308}{31348}One does get used to it.
{31354}{31426}And the human-animals,|grossly undersized.
{31432}{31490}They don't make good eating,|Your Excellency.
{31496}{31552}-My executive assistant, Ker.|-Thank you.
{31558}{31650}He has been fully trained|to replace me as chief of security.
{31656}{31745}-As soon as my transfer goes through.|-Well, Ker. . .
{31750}{31831}. . .once we finish mining out|this miserable little planet. . .
{31836}{31882}. . .Let's do the universe a favor.
{31887}{31945}Let's exterminate the lot of them.
{32014}{32074}-Oh, you're too much.|-So they tell me.
{32080}{32125}Please, come this way.
{32230}{32274}Spy satellites recorded those.
{32280}{32358}-What is this species?|-According to the Clinko historians. . .
{32363}{32402}. . .the species is called "dog. "
{32408}{32449}-Dog.|-Yes.
{32459}{32538}Obviously the superior race,|having the man-animal chauffeur.
{32560}{32659}Well, dogs did prove to be|more cooperative than the man-animals.
{32664}{32741}They weren't as useful|when it came to manual labor.
{32798}{32884}I am honored by your visit,|Your Excellency.
{32889}{32917}Thank you, Planetship.
{32922}{32998}You'll be pleased. I approved|additional labor resources.
{33003}{33060}They'll be here|by the end of quarter cycle.
{33065}{33106}Thank you, Your Excellency.
{33116}{33160}Now, let's see.
{33234}{33291}Your long overdue transfer.
{33304}{33401}You must be looking forward to getting|off this disgusting excuse of a planet.
{33407}{33505}I just want to do whatever serves|the corporation best, sir.
{33510}{33576}Very admirable.|And I must say, you've done. . .
{33582}{33652}. . .a first-rate job here|as interim security chief.
{33657}{33712}Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
{33717}{33754}I do what I can.
{33759}{33832}So we've decided to keep you|for another tour of service.
{33943}{33993}There must be some mistake.
{33998}{34065}Home Office does not make mistakes.
{34070}{34126}Of course not.|But have you looked at my file?
{34141}{34223}It explicitly says that this|is a temporary assignment.
{34370}{34450}Are you not aware that I graduated|top of my class?
{34455}{34487}Quite an accomplishment.
{34498}{34568}I don't mean to second-guess|the Home Office. . .
{34573}{34634}. . .but surely I could be|of better service--
{34639}{34754}Home Office is well aware of your|academic achievements and talents.
{34759}{34866}That's why we've decided not to keep|you here for another five cycles.
{34995}{35031}It's a joke.
{35091}{35115}Thank you, sir.
{35120}{35206}I don't know if I|could've kept my sanity. . .
{35211}{35258}. . .to be here another five cycles.
{35263}{35355}We've decided to keep you here|for another 50 cycles!
{35390}{35449}With endless options for renewal!
{36046}{36106}Those options, of course. . .
{36111}{36169}. . .being at Home Office's discretion.
{36174}{36204}Not yours.
{36251}{36284}The senator. . .
{36322}{36375}. . .has a lot of friends.
{36525}{36576}Would you please tell the senator. . .
{36582}{36651}. . .if I'd had even an inkling that|that was his daughter--
{36657}{36692}Watch your tongue.
{36746}{36833}The senator's exact words to me were,|and I'm quoting:
{36838}{36906}"If that blasted Terl tries|to talk his way out of it. . .
{36911}{36967}. . .have him vaporized on the spot. "
{37015}{37107}But cheer up.|There's one bright side to this.
{37112}{37204}One day you're going to die,|and when you end up in hell. . .
{37217}{37287}. . .at least it'll be a step up|from this place.
{38646}{38694}You haven't left for Psychlo.
{38708}{38798}Your powers of observation|are simply startling.
{38810}{38848}Give me three pans to go.
{38912}{38970}I don't know what|you're so down about.
{38982}{39034}You still get to be head of security.
{39039}{39158}Which, from what I can tell,|is a pretty cushy job.
{39166}{39230}Well, I can assure you. . .
{39235}{39354}. . .that I was not groomed since birth|to have some cushy job. . .
{39359}{39429}. . .that even a moron like you|could perform.
{39449}{39533}While you were still learning|how to spell your name. . .
{39538}{39629}. . .I was being trained|to conquer galaxies!
{39679}{39711}To do anything less. . .
{39716}{39791}. . .is a disgrace|to my entire family line.
{39825}{39864}That'll be six credits.
{39872}{39904}Put it on my tab.
{39909}{39935}You don't have a tab.
{39945}{39979}I do now.
{40953}{41015}You're new here,|so I'll explain how it works.
{41042}{41072}I eat first.
{41078}{41112}Then my men eat.
{41118}{41191}If there's anything left,|you can share it with them.
{41200}{41247}That's how it used to work.
{41263}{41323}Greener, let's just stay alive.
{41329}{41353}You're right.
{41360}{41392}-So I'll fight you.|-No.
{41420}{41484}Without food,|we don't have strength to escape.
{41489}{41550}-So now we're escaping?|-I am.
{41555}{41579}Come if you want.
{41671}{41730}We fight, it's to the death.
{42272}{42314}Say your prayers to the gods!
{43006}{43099}We have enough problems without|killing each other over food.
{43159}{43251}From now on, we eat at the same time.
{44109}{44136}Sir.
{44251}{44300}I was wondering when|you'd look at that.
{44314}{44423}It came in last week,|and I put it right in your box.
{44494}{44565}I've wasted my time, haven't I?
{44612}{44707}If you're going to lie to me, have|the decency to do a credible job. . .
{44712}{44776}. . .so I don't look like an idiot|for training you.
{44782}{44881}But I'm not lying. I put the photo|in your box as soon as it came in.
{44886}{44966}You are pathetic. You wouldn't last|one day at the academy.
{44971}{45048}-And I saw you.|-What?
{45137}{45170}You said:
{45180}{45260}"We use picto-cameras|to spy on other offices.
{45265}{45363}But under no circumstance|do we spy on our own office. "
{45368}{45422}That's right. We don't. I do.
{45442}{45480}Start talking.
{45522}{45571}The photo's from|last week's recon drone.
{45576}{45655}It shows a rockslide in the mountains.|It exposed a gold vein.
{45660}{45709}You were waiting for me to transfer. . .
{45714}{45766}. . .so you could turn it in|and get credit.
{45771}{45803}I didn't think you'd mind.
{45808}{45880}I don't mind. Turn it in. But before|you do, pretend you're not. . .
{45932}{45950}. . .a complete imbecile. . .
{45955}{45994}. . .and check the compo gradients.
{46092}{46144}It's full of uranium. No Psychlo. . .
{46196}{46267}. . .can get there without his breath gas|exploding. No way to mine the gold.
{46356}{46456}But what I do mind is that you|betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!
{46488}{46530}It's worthless! You said so!
{46535}{46594}But you didn't know it was worthless!
{46734}{46794}I would never hurt you, sir.
{46858}{46975}I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me.|It's against regulations, sir.
{46996}{47080}I can make this up to you, sir.|I promise. I swear.
{47085}{47112}Please, sir.
{47190}{47242}You do not have to shoot me, sir.
{47468}{47562}Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?
{47567}{47626}Of course not.|We have work to do. Come.
{47672}{47766}Tomorrow morning, we must warn|the Planetship of the mutiny.
{47771}{47795}What mutiny?
{47800}{47868}The one you're going to pretend|is in the works. . .
{47873}{47975}. . .Like your life depended on it.|Because it does.
{48007}{48090}If the worker revolt takes place,|my informants tell me. . .
{48095}{48175}. . .that the first order of business is|to separate you from your head.
{48215}{48292}Which is why there will be no revolt.
{48297}{48391}I am authorizing you to use whatever|means necessary to prevent it.
{48403}{48508}The best way is to increase profits|and stop cutting the workers' pay.
{48513}{48565}Production equals profits.
{48576}{48660}And I've already ordered|as many new workers as possible. . .
{48665}{48702}. . .to boost production.
{48707}{48771}But we have to pay the new workers.
{48776}{48894}Maybe you were absent the day they|taught economics at the academy, Ker.
{48904}{48960}But nobody works for free.
{48973}{49012}Man-animals do.
{49063}{49122}What if we were to train them|how to mine?
{49243}{49317}Man-animals operating machinery?
{49339}{49396}Have you blown a head gasket?
{49407}{49521}I will be the laughingstock|of the universe.
{49526}{49580}So you should have me|take man-animals. . .
{49585}{49639}. . .with equipment,|out to a remote area. . .
{49644}{49719}. . .better that you don't know where,|and try and train them.
{49731}{49794}Have them do some test mining.
{49799}{49862}If it doesn't work out,|no one will know.
{49867}{49917}-Right.|-And if it does work. . .
{49922}{49974}. . .I will be vaporized.
{49980}{50021}It is against the law.
{50026}{50055}Regulations say. . .
{50060}{50161}. . .a Planetship faced with|a profit-threatening situation. . .
{50166}{50245}. . .is relieved|of all other ordinances. . .
{50250}{50355}. . .to pursue, to protect|and to acquire said profits.
{50360}{50387}There you have it.
{50563}{50632}We stick to the original plan.
{50650}{50688}Bring in new workers. . .
{50707}{50785}. . .and they go on half-pay|as soon as they arrive.
{50790}{50859}And that is final!
{52374}{52442}Run! Run!
{53753}{53814}Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.
{53923}{53995}Last time we didn't even stop timing|until its lungs burst.
{54001}{54025}That's the wager.
{54183}{54274}No way this man-animal|lasts more than four minutes.
{54829}{54859}Help me!
{54876}{54905}I need your air!
{55288}{55341}The wager's off.|The damn thing cheated.
{55542}{55595}The Planetship is hiding something.
{55600}{55657}All we have to do|is find out what it is. . .
{55663}{55708}. . .then we'll have leverage.
{55714}{55768}And then we can get the gold.
{55774}{55825}What do you mean, we? It's my plan.
{55835}{55934}I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then|I'm getting off this stinking planet.
{55940}{55969}Come on, sir.
{55984}{56025}You gotta let me in on it.
{56031}{56092}I barely make any lousy credits|in this job.
{56098}{56174}And I've got five wives|to support, sir.
{56232}{56312}I don't know if I want|to partner up with an idiot.
{56331}{56388}How do I even know|you understand the plan?
{56508}{56611}We train man-animals|who don't need breath gas. . .
{56617}{56668}. . .to mine the gold for us.
{56674}{56754}But Home Planet owns this planet.|The gold belongs to them.
{56760}{56793}That's the beauty of it.
{56799}{56853}Home Planet doesn't know|the gold exists.
{56859}{56927}Those corporate crapheads|won't know we stole it.
{56936}{56981}It's the perfect crime, sir.
{56987}{57086}Putting aside the serious violations|of teaching mining to inferiors. . .
{57092}{57185}. . .and insulting corporate superiors,|each one punishable by death.
{57191}{57236}So it is my duty to report you. . .
{57241}{57333}. . .though you'll be vaporized, and|I'll have to train a new assistant.
{57360}{57411}But it's your stinking plan, sir.
{57416}{57469}So I'm glad I have|a recording of you. . .
{57474}{57525}. . .Laying out the plan|and my reprimanding you.
{57530}{57579}Think of it as part of your education.
{57621}{57650}Education, huh?
{57720}{57819}Never engage in a criminal activity|unless you have a patsy to pin it on. . .
{57825}{57874}. . .in case you ever get found out.
{57889}{57944}Thank you. That's great.
{57950}{57997}But why do I have to be the patsy?
{58003}{58063}So you don't get any bright ideas|to get rid of Terl. . .
{58069}{58118}. . .and keep the gold for yourself.
{58123}{58164}But I'd never double-cross you.
{58170}{58259}I've arranged that if any unfortunate|accident were to befall me. . .
{58276}{58344}. . .this would go|straight to the Home Office.
{60223}{60297}Double or nothing|I can blow off one of its limbs.
{60463}{60545}That one does seem to be unusually|intelligent and resourceful.
{60555}{60604}But it's also defiant.
{60613}{60654}We'll need leverage over it.
{60659}{60712}Leverage? Over a man-animal?
{60717}{60764}Man is a primitive species. . .
{60769}{60882}. . .so we'll need something primitive|for leverage. Like food.
{60892}{60958}What do you think a man-animal|would like to eat?
{60963}{61010}What would he consider a treat?
{61016}{61061}How the crap should I know?
{61081}{61118}There's no way of knowing that.
{61157}{61208}But before we educate it|on the machine. . .
{61213}{61293}. . .we'll take it to the mountains|with a couple of the others.
{61299}{61346}Let them think they've escaped. . .
{61359}{61439}. . .and then we'll sit back|and watch it choose its favorite food.
{61460}{61488}Yes.
{61964}{61990}Look!
{62194}{62280}Three days, and they still haven't|eaten anything yet.
{62286}{62346}Precisely. Now that|the man-animals feel. . .
{62353}{62402}. . .that they have|enough distance from us. . .
{62408}{62482}. . .soon they'll find|their favorite food and celebrate.
{62785}{62807}What is it?
{62814}{62847}Food. Food!
{63024}{63106}No spark, no flints, nothing.|You, Floyd?
{63112}{63169}Plenty to burn.|Nothing to start a fire with.
{63312}{63366}-That's their favorite.|-Of course it is.
{63372}{63446}-They could've selected anything.|-It's not cooked.
{63474}{63571}If man-animal prefers rat uncooked,|then our job is that much easier.
{63578}{63658}If they like their rat so much,|how come those two aren't eating?
{63663}{63770}Don't you know anything? The leader|of the pack always eats first. See?
{63944}{64010}We're really going to have|leverage over them now.
{64361}{64394}What are you doing?
{64648}{64685}They know about the camera.
{64690}{64733}Don't be a knot-head.|It's a man-animal.
{64744}{64793}It couldn't possibly know about it.
{64960}{65011}You sure called that one, sir.
{65016}{65059}No way they know about the cameras.
{65064}{65130}Move your fat ass|and let's go round them up!
{65159}{65188}Crap, lousy ceiling!
{65819}{65869}Great. This is great.
{66133}{66158}What do we do now?
{66164}{66234}What are you thinking, Jonnie?|Don't even think about it.
{66239}{66328}You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie.|You wouldn't live the jump!
{66335}{66393}You can surrender and rot|in those cages.
{66399}{66448}That's your choice.|I'm not going back!
{66455}{66521}The monsters catch us,|they'll take us to the mines.
{66782}{66809}Run!
{67648}{67683}How do we know what he wants?
{67688}{67765}They made me do this before.|Follow me and you'll be fine.
{68026}{68070}Don't touch anything.
{68076}{68132}Get them mad,|think what they'll do to us.
{68782}{68862}Excuse me, but I am your instructor. . .
{68868}{68899}. . .if you'll forgive such arrogance. . .
{68952}{68985}. . .for I do not have the honor|to be a Psychlo.
{68992}{69025}I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.
{69091}{69203}As you are listening to me,|I most likely do not exist. . .
{69209}{69306}. . .as we may have been exterminated|like many other races. . .
{69312}{69382}. . .by the gas drones|of our conquerors.
{69390}{69441}Please forgive my pretension. . .
{69447}{69524}. . .as I try to educate you|in Psychlo. . .
{69530}{69609}. . .the noble language|of our superiors.
{70615}{70643}You understand?
{70678}{70738}You understand me?
{70773}{70839}Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?
{70930}{70985}Obviously, this is going|to take a while.
{71494}{71539}Jonnie! Jonnie!
{71606}{71660}Carlo! Carlo!
{71674}{71759}I know who they are and where they're|from. I can speak their language.
{71765}{71810}-Monsters?|-They're called Psychlos.
{71816}{71847}What did they do to him?
{71854}{71916}They made him look into a light,|a god machine.
{71922}{71975}It teaches.|It's a knowledge machine.
{71982}{72074}It sends pictures through your head|so fast, it's spinning.
{72081}{72121}Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.
{72128}{72231}No, I can't. I have to stay.|I have to learn more about them.
{72258}{72327}This may be our only way out of here.
{72706}{72792}So this is the monster's language?
{72797}{72843}No, no. This is mathematics.
{72895}{72961}This is the unifying language|of the entire universe.
{73100}{73127}Look.
{73137}{73198}This symbol is called a triangle.
{73207}{73267}If all these sides are equal. . .
{73272}{73333}. . .then these three angles|must also be equal.
{73362}{73387}Equal to what?
{73402}{73430}To each other.
{73436}{73511}It's the basic foundation|of Euclidean geometry.
{73535}{73579}Seems pretty hard to understand.
{73592}{73671}No, only at first. And then it|becomes clear in your mind.
{73677}{73725}I learned molecular biology.
{73731}{73832}This is the symbol for water|and engineering.
{73846}{73956}See, a wing, see? And line|and form and artistic composition.
{73973}{74029}You see, this is a square,|like a cage.
{74034}{74138}I thought we were supposed to be|working on stuff to help us escape.
{74194}{74227}This will.
{74248}{74283}All this will.
{74645}{74711}Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.
{74790}{74870}"The security chief should secure|the field vault. . .
{74875}{74948}. . .with an eight-digit|combination code. . .
{74969}{75054}. . .and do not use a personal|or employee. . .
{75059}{75092}. . .identification number. "
{75097}{75146}What's an identification number?
{75156}{75180}There.
{75185}{75231}-How many numbers is that?|-Eight.
{75239}{75263}Eight?
{75281}{75313}Eight.
{75510}{75554}It's more clever than that.
{75559}{75599}The question is, how clever?
{75610}{75655}Try the numbers backwards.
{76009}{76039}Look at this.
{76044}{76087}It's a recording machine.
{76263}{76310}This is how he watches us.
{77013}{77058}Stop! Chrissy, stop!
{77079}{77106}What if he's not dead?
{77111}{77178}Hope is an admirable quality,|but foolish isn't.
{77183}{77252}I can't give you permission|to go and get killed.
{77265}{77298}I don't need your permission.
{77365}{77409}I'm no longer a child.
{77790}{77831}Do you want lunch?
{78066}{78131}It's obviously too much|to ask a man-animal. . .
{78136}{78192}. . .to learn a language|as sophisticated as Psychlo.
{78197}{78275}What if it can understand|and it's pretending it can't?
{78280}{78331}-What the hell for?|-I don't know.
{78336}{78420}Maybe it's secretly listening,|trying to get leverage over on us.
{78432}{78517}Man-animal getting leverage over|a Psychlo. That'll be the day.
{78559}{78627}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{78632}{78674}Maybe we should train another one.
{78686}{78734}No time. When they detect the gold. . .
{78739}{78800}. . .the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{78894}{78962}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{79215}{79241}It speaks Psychlo.
{79246}{79286}Go on, say something else.
{79295}{79342}You'll stay here as my prisoner. . .
{79347}{79414}. . .while you, you go|and get a transporter.
{79434}{79502}Because you've learned Psychlo|doesn't mean you are one.
{79507}{79559}Follow my orders|or I'll have you killed.
{79642}{79688}How exactly do you plan to do that?
{79941}{79990}-Mickey, no!|-Mickey, no!
{80021}{80129}If any of you rat-brains|knew anything about firearms. . .
{80144}{80231}. . .you would know that you never|store loaded weapons.
{80236}{80269}You drop him now!
{80278}{80338}Drop him or I won't mine|an ounce of your gold.
{80358}{80441}I'll have you vaporized|and find someone else to mine it.
{80446}{80472}You don't have time.
{80482}{80538}You can't hide this|from Home Office forever.
{80586}{80682}A man getting leverage over a Psychlo.|That'll be the day.
{80831}{80944}I think it's time that we show|our little friend a thing or two.
{81587}{81642}As long as you cling to|the feeble hope. . .
{81647}{81693}. . .that you'll ever get|the better of me. . .
{81698}{81768}. . .you'll be distracted|from more important things.
{81773}{81819}Which is exactly why. . .
{81824}{81879}. . .I share the following with you:
{81915}{81959}When we attacked your planet. . .
{81980}{82075}. . .all your soldiers and all|their advanced technology. . .
{82084}{82136}. . .could only put up|a nine-minute fight. . .
{82141}{82189}. . .before they were exterminated.
{82212}{82302}Which is why man|is an endangered species.
{82343}{82407}Everything you humans knew is here.
{82412}{82462}You can look at anything you want. . .
{82482}{82551}. . .because there is nothing|that will help you.
{83354}{83385}Satisfied?
{83398}{83425}Yes.
{83444}{83518}I have one more demonstration|for you and your friends.
{83795}{83858}You will be relocated|to a new mining site.
{83863}{83934}If any of you get any bright ideas|about escaping. . .
{83939}{84040}. . .keep in mind that although you|know nothing about firearms, I do.
{84051}{84167}I graduated top marksman in my class.|I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.
{84172}{84207}Tell them what I said.
{84212}{84255}We try to run, he'll kill us.
{84267}{84325}-That's it?|-Yes.
{84347}{84384}Allow me to demonstrate.
{84804}{84837}No! Wait!
{85251}{85308}Let's give this demon|what it deserves.
{85313}{85368}Kill it, I say! Destroy it!
{85373}{85422}Shoot! Shoot!
{85427}{85452}Why wait? Kill it!
{85458}{85493}Kill it. Then we'll run.
{85498}{85529}Then what?
{85537}{85624}What kind of life is it to run?|Living in fear of being hunted?
{85640}{85694}What about those we're leaving behind?
{85699}{85742}There's nothing we can do.
{85747}{85785}Only the gods can free them.
{85790}{85874}You think the lights in the sky|are gods waiting to save us?
{85880}{85988}Do you? Those are planets,|planets like this one.
{85993}{86041}The great villages were built by us.
{86057}{86105}By men and women just like us.
{86112}{86176}Willing to fight to the death|for one thing:
{86192}{86218}Their freedom!
{86223}{86283}Do you think no one has tried?
{86304}{86354}You can't defeat them.
{86475}{86533}That is our fate.
{86575}{86633}Yes, we can. Yes, we can!
{86647}{86684}But we have to go back.
{86689}{86744}We go back and learn|about their weapons.
{86765}{86833}Our race is slowly dying|and will be gone forever.
{86840}{86929}Let it be said that we took|this one chance and fought!
{86936}{86997}Are you with me? Are you with me?!
{87020}{87050}We fight!
{87086}{87161}If you're fighting the beast,|me and my men are with you.
{87166}{87239}Thank you.|It's good to have friends out here.
{87244}{87291}May the gods be with you.
{87432}{87504}One as wise as you has ways|to stop me from shooting.
{87513}{87582}I know if I'd tried,|you would've killed me first.
{87744}{87841}Damn right, rat-brain! That's the|first intelligent thing you've said.
{87873}{87921}Rest break is over.
{87935}{88023}There's something I need you to see|so you're properly motivated.
{88525}{88568}You don't know her?
{88605}{88663}No, I don't know her.
{88683}{88763}She's one of the foulest|looking females I've ever seen.
{88780}{88813}While I tend to agree. . .
{88832}{88937}. . .it's obvious that you show a lack|of aptitude for strategic deception.
{88942}{89051}On the other hand, what you show|marginal proficiency at is. . .
{89079}{89107}. . .drawing.
{89159}{89210}This was found when she was collected.
{89247}{89338}The collar has enough explosives|to remove her head from her body.
{89343}{89384}And this remote. . .
{89395}{89460}. . .will activate it|from anywhere on the planet.
{89465}{89542}So if you disobey me, let me|show you what will happen.
{89547}{89587}Please don't harm her.
{89611}{89640}I believe you.
{89645}{89702}Don't worry, rat-brain.
{89710}{89775}Every collar has its own frequency.
{89782}{89848}I'm not going to blow up|your little female friend.
{89900}{89932}Just. . .
{89982}{90009}. . .this one.
{90051}{90084}You made your point.
{90089}{90138}I said I would mine your gold.
{90154}{90197}Please don't kill him. Please.
{90295}{90323}Fine.
{90339}{90443}Due to our new working relationship,|I will grant you this one request.
{90481}{90516}I won't kill him.
{90532}{90595}But you may never ask of me|anything again.
{90608}{90636}I promise.
{90727}{90797}As I've said, I won't kill him.
{90802}{90827}Yes, sir.
{91258}{91298}Stupid humans.
{91961}{92004}No, no, no.
{92009}{92055}What you did was right.
{92067}{92105}It was right for all of us.
{92119}{92177}Greener, you're a thinker. . .
{92192}{92237}. . .and the gods respect thinkers.
{92250}{92294}You didn't kill Sammy.
{92315}{92380}Jonnie, this is not living.
{92398}{92450}This is. . .
{92469}{92489}. . .cages!
{92498}{92522}Cages!
{92527}{92611}Even if we escaped and went back|to where we all came from. . .
{92616}{92646}. . .it'd be like you said.
{92651}{92717}We'd be waiting for the Psychlos|to hunt us down.
{92729}{92804}I think that is not living either.
{92912}{92958}We all chose to fight.
{93577}{93641}-Count us in too!|-What's going on?
{93646}{93721}Someone knows how to speak|the Psychlo's language.
{93726}{93765}He's gonna help us fight.
{95106}{95148}Yes.
{95173}{95242}Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.
{95266}{95322}She's. . . .
{95327}{95379}His soon-to-be|newly acquired secretary.
{95384}{95439}-Yes.|-Really?
{95448}{95540}She's stupid enough not to be a menace,|pretty enough to be decorative.
{95545}{95647}She gets drunk with economical speed|and has other advantages.
{95719}{95755}I can see that.
{95761}{95824}-Don't you have some work to do?|-No.
{95829}{95849}Ker?
{95855}{95888}All right, sir.
{95951}{95990}Now, listen, missy. . .
{95995}{96070}. . .I'm still waiting for|the Planetship's accounts.
{96139}{96217}I had to go way beyond|the call of duty to get these.
{96222}{96298}I see. Well, that's why|I especially chose you.
{96310}{96364}So you'll keep your side|of the bargain?
{96384}{96427}Which was?
{96435}{96524}You said we'd have a huge house|when we go back to Psychlo next year.
{96530}{96587}-We're going to be rich, right?|-Right.
{96597}{96685}I am going to make you|as happy as a baby Psychlo. . .
{96690}{96757}. . .on a straight diet of Kerbango.
{97081}{97126}Well, isn't it interesting. . .
{97131}{97196}. . .that you have been keeping|two sets of books. . .
{97201}{97251}. . .and telling all the workers. . .
{97257}{97315}. . .that the planet has been|operating at a loss?
{97356}{97448}I only claimed that it was|running at a loss. . .
{97454}{97556}. . .to try and motivate them all|to work harder.
{97561}{97599}Oh, yes, of course.
{97609}{97662}And it had nothing to do|with the fact. . .
{97667}{97725}. . .that it allowed you|to cut the workers' pay. . .
{97731}{97806}. . .and keep all the extra credit|for yourself. Did it?
{97835}{97905}That. Well, I can explain that.
{97910}{98015}Well, unfortunately, the company|requires me to vaporize you.
{98056}{98081}On the other hand. . .
{98096}{98170}. . .I could understand someone|in your situation. . .
{98175}{98227}. . .being old and having no future. . .
{98233}{98304}. . .coming up with ways|to solve your financial problems.
{98333}{98396}-You can?|-Oh, yes.
{98404}{98464}It's really of no interest|to anybody. . .
{98469}{98526}. . .to have you not be Planetship.
{98532}{98629}But it would be prudent of you|to start to share your authority.
{98875}{98973}But these forms are|all blank, undated.
{98988}{99048}You could put anything|you wanted on them.
{99054}{99140}You would run the entire planet!
{99182}{99288}I would be nothing but a puppet.
{99304}{99367}Well, if you don't want|to do it that way. . .
{99372}{99423}. . .we could always do it by. . .
{99452}{99487}. . .the book.
{99640}{99739}What the hell does the Planetship|need with all this mining equipment?
{99744}{99787}That's not even the crazy part.
{99792}{99877}He's ordered me to take a group|of man-animals to a remote area. . .
{99882}{99961}. . .with the equipment to see|if they can be trained to mine.
{99966}{100043}Man-animals being able to mine?
{100048}{100077}Yes.
{100249}{100300}Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.
{100314}{100343}Indeed.
{100348}{100388}But what can I do?
{100393}{100439}An order is an order.
{100557}{100607}You have a busy day, rat-brain.
{100612}{100650}First, learning how to fly. . .
{100656}{100729}. . .then on to the learning machine|for mining techniques.
{101443}{101470}Crash one more time. . .
{101475}{101554}. . .and your little friend|will no longer be among the living.
{101564}{101586}Again.
{101591}{101627}Again!
{102630}{102713}Never underestimate what a little|leverage can do, rat-brain.
{103361}{103393}That's good, man-animal.
{103408}{103485}This is the lever where|we mine the gold!
{103490}{103541}Lever! Up, down!
{103573}{103657}Warning: External sensors indicate|dangerous radiation levels ahead.
{103662}{103705}This is as far as I can go!
{103710}{103744}Land it!
{104097}{104135}Meet me back here in 1 4 days.
{104140}{104192}I want the ship's cage|half-filled with gold.
{104314}{104380}And even though I won't be|at the mining site. . .
{104435}{104465}. . .I'll be watching you.
{104716}{104788}-How's your side?|-It's good. Good.
{105091}{105133}Next time, you fly.
{105410}{105480}No, no, no.|Even if we do mine enough gold. . .
{105485}{105557}. . .we'll be lucky to fill|half of that cage in time.
{105562}{105592}That's why we're not mining.
{105597}{105682}What about the big uglies watching|us with that eye in the sky?
{105687}{105742}Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?
{105747}{105806}We split them in half.|One group goes. . .
{105811}{105843}. . .and one group stays. . .
{105848}{105908}. . .and it looks as if|we're still working.
{105954}{106049}But if we don't deliver it in 1 4 days|to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.
{106055}{106108}There's a place called Fort Knox|where the gold's already been mined.
{106113}{106186}Listen, there will be no mining,|but we'll deliver it.
{106191}{106281}Okay, so we have to pretend|that we're mining the gold.
{106317}{106394}We have to figure out where|we're gonna get the gold. . .
{106399}{106460}. . .then we have to get the supplies|to help our revolt.
{106479}{106500}Yeah.
{106505}{106565}We barely have men to|do one of those things. . .
{106570}{106616}. . .Let's alone all three.
{106664}{106733}It's good to have friends|on the outside!
{107167}{107187}Come on!
{107192}{107260}If you two kept your eyes open,|that'd be a great help.
{107265}{107338}Look for an ocean. If you see any,|we've gone too far.
{107393}{107433}I think this is it.
{107438}{107481}I think we're in Washington.
{107486}{107550}-We're still in Colorado.|-That's impossible.
{107556}{107596}I've been watching,|we haven't crossed this line.
{107601}{107647}You're not paying attention.
{107653}{107742}Let him navigate and watch me.|You're gonna fly on the way back.
{107761}{107821}We couldn't have crossed|all these lines.
{107826}{107912}Well, we did. The lines must|have faded over time.
{108278}{108355}This great village was the capital|for all our tribes.
{108360}{108420}This is where our people's|history was buried.
{108670}{108741}Here. When the Psychlos|attacked Earth. . .
{108748}{108797}. . .they sent out flying gas drones.
{108803}{108890}Our ancestors must've made it out|into these remote radiated areas. . .
{108895}{108985}. . .and the only reason they survived|was because radiation is. . .
{108990}{109029}. . .Lethal to the Psychlos.
{109034}{109105}-And that was not good for them.|-That's good for us.
{109110}{109180}Even if we fail, the people|will be safe if they stay--
{109185}{109228}Safe from being hunted. . .
{109235}{109300}. . .but radiation is|also poisonous for humans.
{109323}{109365}So, you see, either way. . .
{109390}{109442}. . .if we don't take back our planet. . .
{109483}{109539}. . .the last of humanity|becomes extinct.
{110213}{110278}Based on what I've read about|Psychlo security. . .
{110283}{110312}. . .if we revolted. . .
{110317}{110396}. . .only using weapons they don't|perceive as any real threat. . .
{110401}{110461}. . .if we just use rocks and sticks. . .
{110466}{110541}. . .they'll just throw us|back in the cages.
{110546}{110575}But. . .
{110590}{110676}. . .we're gonna stage this revolt|inside the dome.
{110681}{110794}So the Psychlos are gonna have to|come inside the city to round us up.
{110809}{110882}And that is when we blow the dome.
{110910}{110950}Carlo's gonna blow the dome.
{110956}{111007}-They won't have masks.|-They can't breathe.
{111012}{111040}-They die.|-Carlo?
{111045}{111116}-I'm gonna blow the dome?|-You're gonna blow the dome.
{111154}{111229}Piece of cake.|Piece of cake, piece of cake.
{111318}{111381}But remember, as soon as|we blow the dome. . .
{111386}{111433}. . .boom, stage 2 alarm.
{111438}{111458}What is that?
{111463}{111540}Thousands of gas drones and troops|will be teleported here.
{111545}{111629}-We can't fight against that.|-Then what's the point?
{111634}{111714}If they send more monsters to Earth,|we get wiped out.
{111728}{111795}Well, the point is,|we don't let it get to stage 2.
{111800}{111862}We'll destroy their Home Planet|before it happens.
{111867}{111934}-Their Home Planet?|-Their Home Planet.
{111974}{112042}We need some extra supplies|before we can do that.
{112047}{112105}Our first stop is a radiation bomb|storage bunker.
{112110}{112167}Is everyone clear?
{112215}{112240}Count us in.
{112992}{113036}-Look.|-Flying machines.
{113041}{113119}These are flying machines.|They're weapons of some kind.
{113183}{113217}Flying spears.
{113225}{113279}I think there's a little more|to it than that.
{113700}{113742}It's a learning machine.
{113758}{113793}Teach us to fly.
{114246}{114272}You're right.
{114278}{114312}It's like breaking a horse.
{114330}{114382}Can you teach your men to fly this?
{114387}{114457}-Piece of cake, piece of cake.|-Piece of cake.
{114462}{114504}-Try and keep it level.|-Jonnie!
{114509}{114539}-What is it?|-I think I found one.
{114544}{114614}Come on! Nuclear firebomb!
{114619}{114651}Piece of cake.
{114676}{114738}According to the book, there's|a firing mechanism. . .
{114743}{114826}. . .that has to be in place before|it's operational.
{115319}{115362}Don't touch the auto-sensor.
{115367}{115404}What happens if we do?
{115409}{115475}The bomb will explode. Big fire.
{115513}{115561}Look. Greeners from this cave.
{115566}{115606}Off. Off.
{115987}{116008}War--
{116013}{116035}--ning.
{116040}{116082}Warning. Warning.
{116087}{116116}Warning.
{116138}{116184}Warning.
{116189}{116216}Get it?
{116343}{116405}What does the auto-sensor look like?
{116412}{116465}There's an illustration in Appendix A.
{116600}{116636}What? What?
{116725}{116760}We don't have Appendix A.
{116966}{116992}More books, Jonnie.
{117201}{117234}It's okay.
{117251}{117316}I thought you said nuclear fires|were powerful?
{117321}{117358}It's not nuclear. Mickey!
{117363}{117393}Sorry.
{117398}{117435}You're sorry. Mickey!
{117440}{117514}Stop touching things|and turn off the damn light.
{117519}{117543}Leave it on.
{117587}{117617}Look.
{117765}{117801}Good work, Mickey.
{117807}{117854}You just found Appendix A.
{118238}{118294}Will this be enough to blow up|their whole planet?
{118299}{118356}Radiation reacts with their|planet's atmosphere.
{118361}{118433}-There's enough to destroy it forever.|-Let me do it.
{118486}{118541}Let me go there|and detonate the weapon.
{118548}{118627}It's brave of you, Mickey,|but it's my plan, so I go.
{118632}{118706}You're the only one who speaks|the monsters' language.
{118711}{118759}You know things about them!
{118778}{118817}Listen. . .
{118822}{118887}. . .without you leading this revolt. . .
{118922}{118956}. . .we might not succeed.
{120198}{120284}I hope their eye in the sky didn't|see the gold through the lead walls.
{120736}{120789}Start filling the cage.
{120794}{120886}We'll hide half and deliver|the other half to Terl tonight.
{121363}{121400}Why is it in bars?
{121448}{121485}I assumed, sir. . .
{121490}{121586}. . .that a Psychlo of your refinement|wouldn't want raw ore.
{121684}{121716}Really?
{121993}{122044}Since you have had extra time. . .
{122049}{122099}. . .to smelt it into bricks. . .
{122104}{122168}. . .I'll expect the rest of the gold|in seven days.
{122880}{122940}He has no intention of sharing|that gold with you.
{122992}{123055}What the hell are you talking about?
{123085}{123153}Why are you here?|You should be mining the gold!
{123158}{123229}You really think the only reason|he made that recording. . .
{123234}{123308}. . .was to have you as his patsy?|Do you, Ker?
{123323}{123396}No. He has leverage over you. . .
{123401}{123464}. . .and it'll guarantee you|never see an ounce.
{123494}{123555}How do you know|about those recordings?
{123566}{123605}It really is amazing. . .
{123610}{123679}. . .the collection of discs|you find in Terl's personal vault.
{124055}{124078}First, we trade.
{124083}{124122}-The disc--|-I don't think so!
{124128}{124185}Because if you don't give me|the disc now. . .
{124190}{124231}. . .I will blow your head off.
{124728}{124766}You want to trade?
{124798}{124826}Let's trade.
{124857}{124887}Hooray!
{124942}{124999}Won't the Psychlo see|I'm not wearing the collar?
{125005}{125079}After tonight, won't matter|much either way.
{125111}{125176}Jonnie, I know you|don't believe in fate. . .
{125183}{125237}. . .but I've always known|this was your destiny.
{125246}{125318}This is our destiny.|It's freedom for all of us.
{125331}{125367}For our children.
{125401}{125432}Children?
{126012}{126042}Beautiful.
{126360}{126383}Quickly!
{126800}{126865}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{126870}{126930}There's no time.|When they detect the gold...
{126935}{126997}... the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{127106}{127185}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127229}{127324}When they detect the gold, the|Planetship will know what we're doing.
{127384}{127441}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127446}{127467}I've been thinking.
{127480}{127572}80/20 is a pretty fair|distribution of the gold.
{127589}{127631}But I should get the 80% .
{127650}{127732}And with my share, I'm gonna|fire all my wives. . .
{127738}{127773}. . .and buy new ones.
{127798}{127851}Maybe pretty ones this time.
{127880}{127907}Ker-bango!
{127962}{127990}Congratulations.
{127997}{128071}You've learned how to get|leverage over someone, haven't you?
{128090}{128163}Which means I haven't wasted my time|training you, have I?
{128182}{128228}-You're not upset?|-Don't be crazy.
{128237}{128285}You know how long I've waited|for this day?
{128291}{128342}I know the perfect way to celebrate.
{128391}{128446}What are you doing?
{128479}{128507}You can't shoot me.
{128512}{128586}I made a copy and gave it|to someone for safekeeping.
{128591}{128666}You are just too good of a teacher.
{128685}{128786}How about giving your old teacher|a clue as to who this might be?
{128791}{128841}You insult yourself, sir.
{128846}{128879}You taught me better.
{128884}{128937}How am I supposed to know who it is?
{128942}{128979}I don't know.
{128984}{129047}It could be anybody|on this damn planet.
{129053}{129101}-It could be a mechanic.|-No.
{129107}{129158}-It could be a concubine.|-No, no.
{129163}{129221}It could be anybody|in communications.
{129226}{129247}Wrong!
{129253}{129346}I hate these things. It's like|it's a test I'm not prepared for.
{129381}{129494}Well, hell, it could even be|our friendly bartender!
{129630}{129683}Please. I made a mistake.
{129800}{129855}Now, give me the original disc. . .
{129860}{129941}. . .then meet me at the teleportation|platform in two hours.
{129970}{130004}Sir.
{130255}{130293}The control bunker's to the right.
{130303}{130326}Three guards left.
{130334}{130403}Two from the guardhouse,|one coming from the north.
{130422}{130460}I'll take the guardhouse.
{131999}{132066}Jonnie, the shooting's|triggered the alarm.
{132084}{132167}Five guards from the south,|heavily armed and moving fast.
{132174}{132208}Between you and the bunker.
{132220}{132249}Jonnie!
{133829}{133911}The man-animals have escaped.|They're running into the city.
{133918}{133991}Send some guards out|and round them up. I'm busy.
{133996}{134054}Don't bother me|with every little detail.
{134059}{134094}Gotta round them up.
{134373}{134399}Psychlos!
{134433}{134464}Psychlos!
{134510}{134557}7-7-3.
{134597}{134680}Greener? Carlo. Explosives are set.|Can I blow the dome?
{134730}{134755}Greener?
{134768}{134816}What's going on? Talk to me!
{134821}{134883}It's Carlo. What's going on?|Talk to me.
{134888}{134918}Hold on!
{134950}{135007}If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo,|they'll send drones.
{135012}{135092}Well, hurry up. Just hurry up,|because I've got company.
{139074}{139094}Here they are.
{139776}{139826}Panther!
{140346}{140405}Hang on. I'm right on his tail.
{141616}{141659}You know what you gotta do.
{142340}{142369}Greener, come on.
{142374}{142412}I've gotta blow this dome now!
{142417}{142473}I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb.|Hang on.
{142480}{142511}I'm seconds away.
{142823}{142848}Jonnie, come on.
{142854}{142897}They're destroying the bombs.
{142904}{142939}-It's now or never.|-Now!
{142944}{143008}Now, go ahead! Blow the dome!|Go! Go! Go!
{143168}{143235}Teleportation sequence terminated.
{143262}{143298}Interrupting something?
{143312}{143347}Jonnie? Jonnie?
{144142}{144195}Why isn't it coming down?
{144224}{144275}The dome is holding!
{144305}{144357}-It's not working.|-It's only cracked!
{144473}{144540}The dome isn't broken.|We can't hold out long.
{144611}{144689}Attention! This is Terl,|your chief of security.
{144707}{144784}Exterminate all man-animals at will.
{144789}{144825}And happy hunting!
{145160}{145207}Run! Run!
{145914}{145945}What's with the dome?
{145974}{146034}Hold on, I'm taking it out now.
{147036}{147070}Help us!
{147079}{147106}They're killing us!
{147297}{147378}We're not gonna make it!|I think we should pull out!
{147870}{147959}I'm blowing the dome. In five.
{147974}{148001}Four.
{148155}{148183}Three.
{148204}{148230}Two.
{148244}{148265}One.
{148317}{148354}Piece of cake.
{149038}{149093}Everyone on the ground now! Go!
{151139}{151203}Teleportation sequence activated.
{151250}{151316}Teleportation sequence activated.
{151331}{151401}Psychlo War Center,|this is a stage 3 alert!
{151407}{151457}I repeat, a stage 3 alert.
{151462}{151532}Initiate the gas drone|extermination sequence.
{151882}{151940}You have been|quite a challenge, rat-brain.
{151945}{151998}You'll make a hell|of a conversation piece. . .
{152004}{152082}. . .when you're stuffed|and hanging on the academy wall.
{153220}{153261}Where's the rest of my gold?
{153271}{153326}I'll exchange it for my woman's life.
{153342}{153420}My life is over, but hers is|of no consequence to you.
{153446}{153526}Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain.|Now, where is it?
{153531}{153586}Trust me, you don't want to do that.
{153592}{153649}Trust me, there's nothing I want more.
{156094}{156137}Carlo came through.
{157576}{157638}Why don't you vaporize me?
{157828}{157851}Leverage.
{157945}{158012}If there are other Psychlo|colonies out there. . .
{158017}{158086}. . .they'll send out gas drones|and exterminate us.
