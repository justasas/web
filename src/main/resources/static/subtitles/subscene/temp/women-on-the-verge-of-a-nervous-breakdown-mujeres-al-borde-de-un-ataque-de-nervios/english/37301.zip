1
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:45,720
Ivan and I moved here
a few months ago.

2
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:47,958
The world was falling apart...

3
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:51,672
and I wanted to save it
and save myself.

4
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,779
I felt like Noah.

5
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,640
In the coop on my terrace...

6
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,872
I wanted to save
a couple of each species.

7
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,688
Anyway...

8
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:04,855
I couldn't save
the couple I cared about most--

9
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,353
Ivan and me.

10
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,403
Pepa, darling...

11
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:11,772
I never want to hear you say,
''I'm unhappy. ''

12
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:13,014
Yours, Ivan.

13
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,267
Life means nothing without you.

14
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:48,506
Will you marry me?

15
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:54,713
1 ,001 nights
wouldn't be enough.

16
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,684
I can't live without you.

17
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,621
I love you,
desire you, need you.

18
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,991
That night in the jungle
was heaven.

19
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,925
Let's get married again.

20
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,968
You're the geisha of my life.
Sayonara.

21
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,357
With you by my side,
I don't need success.

22
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:18,108
I'm willing
to accept you as you are.

23
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:23,613
Baby, some things
are unmistakably American.

24
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,710
I'm all yours.

25
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:32,251
- I accept you as you are.
- Great.

26
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:43,612
How many men
have you had to forget?

27
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:46,903
Say something nice.

28
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:51,649
Lie.

29
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,333
Tell me you've been
waiting for me...

30
00:04:56,932 --> 00:04:59,233
and you'd die
if I didn't return.

31
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:03,970
Say you still love me
as I love you.

32
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:13,152
Thanks.

33
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,871
Thanks a lot.

34
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,031
Call these two numbers.

35
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:42,878
First, I'll call one...

36
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,925
then the other.

37
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:53,312
Pepa.

38
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:56,678
Pepa, sweetheart,
did you oversleep?

39
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,848
We started without you.

40
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:02,589
Listen. Pack all my stuff
in a suitcase.

41
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,802
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

42
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:07,239
I'll come and pick it up
and say good-bye...

43
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:09,159
but I'll call you before.

44
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:12,290
If you don't want to see me,
just leave it downstairs.

45
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:15,911
Thanks for being so understanding.

46
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,569
I don't deserve it.

47
00:06:19,816 --> 00:06:21,343
I'll call later, darling.

48
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:25,566
Ivan?

49
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,865
''EXA.'' Hello.

50
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,232
Is Ivan there?

51
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:41,705
He just called me.

52
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,909
Sorry. He just left.

53
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:48,353
But your director is here
having a fit 'cause you're not here.

54
00:06:48,426 --> 00:06:50,336
Yes. Here he is.

55
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:56,006
I'm sorry, German.

56
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:59,720
I couldn't sleep,
so I took a pill.

57
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:03,267
Don't worry.just come now.

58
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,801
I'll be right there.

59
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:08,869
I have to stop by
for some test results on my way.

60
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,176
Okay, but make it quick.

61
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:15,655
Some people are lucky.
I'll call your cab now.

62
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:19,970
Who wanted a taxi?

63
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:25,218
Whoever asked for a taxi,
come to the front desk.

64
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,147
Don't smoke...

65
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,831
eat properly,
and you'll be fine.

66
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,029
Mr. Salcedo,
please pick up the telephone.

67
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:48,749
It's about time. Studio seven.

68
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:50,189
Did Ivan call again?

69
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,556
No. Forget him, honey.

70
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:54,663
I'm working on it.

71
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,142
Just give me time.

72
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:57,898
And cut the microphone.

73
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:01,382
Give me that paper!
Give me that!

74
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,979
- I'm really sorry, guys.
- Okay, let's go.

75
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:25,712
Arturo, do you take...

76
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:27,303
Eugenia as your wife...

77
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:30,192
and promise to be faithful,
for richer or for poorer...

78
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:32,591
in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

79
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:34,828
Yeah, I think so.

80
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:40,073
And you, Eugenia. Eugenia?

81
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,836
Yes, Father?

82
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:43,661
Do you take Arturo
as your husband?

83
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,868
Sure. Of course I do.

84
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:50,637
What God has united,
let no man tear asunder.

85
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:53,008
Can we kiss now, Father?

86
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,041
My child, you mustn't trust any man.

87
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,675
Not even my husband?

88
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:00,398
You can't be too careful.

89
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:03,496
Fine. We'll check it later.

90
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,262
Roll it.

91
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,852
- You start rehearsing.
- Thank you.

92
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,763
Here. Drink.

93
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:36,299
I'm not thirsty.

94
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:38,129
It'll help you to sleep.

95
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:41,972
I already tried it,
and it didn't help.

96
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:44,372
How many men
have you had to forget?

97
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:47,405
As many as the women
you remember.

98
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:48,852
Don't go.

99
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:50,292
I haven't moved.

100
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:52,213
Say something nice.

101
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,239
What shall I say?

102
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,791
Lie. Tell me you've
waited for me forever.

103
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:03,091
I've waited for you
all these years.

104
00:10:03,158 --> 00:10:05,493
Say you'd die
if I didn't return.

105
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,788
I'd have died
if you hadn't returned.

106
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:12,303
Say you still love me
as I love you.

107
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,190
I still love you as you love me.

108
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,557
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

109
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,550
Pepa, are you okay?

110
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:30,520
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

111
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:49,650
You've got some nerve.

112
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:51,827
Call this number, please.

113
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:54,070
You have no right, Pepa.

114
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:55,512
Just dial the number.

115
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:56,953
You're making a fool of yourself.

116
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:59,571
Well, a little more won't hurt.

117
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:01,431
- Were you crying?
- Yes.

118
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:04,848
There! You see? I knew it, Pepa.

119
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:08,469
Dial! They won't like
you holding up our work.

120
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:12,947
Yes, right away.
Excuse me! At your service!

121
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,394
My coffee can wait.

122
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,176
I've had enough breakfasts
in my time.

123
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,098
The other woman's number.

124
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:22,295
She'll never learn. Not her.

125
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:26,074
She should have by now.
Not her.

126
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,950
No way.

127
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,548
- Who's this?
- Pepa Marcos. Is Ivan there?

128
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:39,734
- Forgive my bothering you.
- I won't forgive you.

129
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:41,529
I must speak to him. It's urgent.

130
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:42,971
How dare you call here?

131
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:46,201
Don't yell at me.
I just had a fainting spell.

132
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,277
I don't care if you drop dead!

133
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:50,869
Look, Ivan and I are finished.

134
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,211
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off yourself!

135
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,531
Just tell him to call me.

136
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:01,398
Pepa, I didn't know
you had fainted.

137
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,845
Poor thing.

138
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,601
This is too much!

139
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,328
Don't you dare defend her!

140
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:07,925
- Mom.
- Yes?

141
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,373
We should talk.

142
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:13,367
Not now. I'm doing my eye lines,
and you make me nervous.

143
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,327
Okay. Then later?

144
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:17,846
Later. Later.

145
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,141
What's wrong?

146
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:26,233
That bitch Ivan sleeps with
had the nerve to call me.

147
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:29,370
He should be more discreet.

148
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,861
Why haven't I thrown those out?

149
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:33,725
Dad wouldn't let you.

150
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,410
I could sell them at the store,
you know?

151
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,335
I like wearing them.

152
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,256
It's as if time stood still.

153
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:43,387
Well, it hasn't stood still.

154
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:47,866
Don't be rude.
Let her wear what she wants.

155
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:50,752
Go on. Humor her.
She'll never get well.

156
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,672
Let me help you.

157
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,454
- Hold that.
- Let's see. There.

158
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:02,337
Like it?

159
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:04,257
You look terrific.

160
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:07,770
You're a great liar, Dad.
That's why I love you.

161
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,554
You think it's too dark?

162
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,653
- No.
- Neither do I.

163
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,281
- Am I interrupting something?
- No. How are you?

164
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:26,592
- Fine.
- How's the penthouse?

165
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,075
- Are you enjoying it?
- It's great, but I'm here to sublet it.

166
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:32,188
We'll get a good price for it.

167
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,489
Good. I'll want to rent an apartment.

168
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:38,371
Can I make a call?
I've been out all day.

169
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:40,291
What type of apartment?

170
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:43,357
With a terrace, but not so big.

171
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:47,803
- Yours is number seven Montalban?
- Yes, seventh floor.

172
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:51,489
220 square yards
including the terrace.

173
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:58,845
Everybody just loved your scale model.

174
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,292
It turned out well.

175
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,016
The jerk hasn't called.

176
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,956
- How much is that?
- 200 pesetas.

177
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:12,221
- Is Isabel here?
- She's busy. Can I help you?

178
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:14,750
- I have to see her.
- One moment.

179
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,647
Hi.

180
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,854
You want to try a facial?

181
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,537
- I can't now.
- It's free.

182
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:27,811
They're giving a demonstration.

183
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,629
I need sleeping pills.

184
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:32,289
I've run out.

185
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,386
- You have the prescription?
- No. I'll bring it later or tomorrow.

186
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:38,661
I can't sleep without them.

187
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:41,314
- Okay.
- Thanks.

188
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:49,950
- She's not much in person.
- She's skinnier than on TV.

189
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:12,070
Pepa, honey, are you there?

190
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:14,888
If I can't reach you,
I'm going to get worried.

191
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,329
So am I.

192
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:20,224
I've had no luck
reaching you today, so--

193
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,990
Well?

194
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:24,481
I feel you're avoiding me.

195
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:26,890
Such bullshit.

196
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:29,606
I'll keep trying until I get you.

197
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:31,944
- I may get lucky.
- Sure.

198
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:34,565
I really want to talk to you.

199
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:37,451
- I miss you.
- I noticed.

200
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,687
Well, take care.

201
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:41,611
See you later.

202
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:43,586
Asshole.

203
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:16,644
This is Juan
at the real estate agency.

204
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:19,915
Tomorrow I'm sending a couple
to see your apartment.

205
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,405
Try to be there in the morning.
Thank you.

206
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,782
I'm sick of being good.

207
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:21,384
I shouldn't smoke.

208
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,426
I'm finally getting rid of this shit!

209
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:37,324
And this dumb flower!

210
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:41,907
Who'd think of giving a duck
as a present?

211
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,350
Only you.

212
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:47,442
But now I'll get rid of it all.
And of you!

213
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:09,746
''Something's come up
that concerns both of us.

214
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:14,131
I must talk to you before you leave.''

215
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:47,127
Follow that cab!

216
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:50,974
I thought this only happened
in the movies.

217
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,640
WELCOME TO MAMBO TAXI

218
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,559
MAGAZINES FOR RENT

219
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,884
Help yourself.
It's on the house.

220
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:04,571
Thanks.just follow that cab.

221
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:07,358
Don't worry. It's under control.

222
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:10,109
Do you mind the Mambo?

223
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:13,276
I've got everything.
Heavy metal, rock, soul...

224
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:16,280
cumbias, even sevillanas.

225
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:18,720
Salsa, techno-pop...

226
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,280
whatever you like.

227
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:22,775
- You really like Mambo?
- I love Mambo.

228
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,989
Yes, the Mambo...

229
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:27,644
goes best with this decor.

230
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:32,098
You're that TV actress.

231
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:36,571
You play the killer's mother.

232
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:39,196
How about an autograph?

233
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:43,193
It's for my girlfriend.
Could you make it personal?

234
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,918
- What's her name?
- Azucena.

235
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:50,460
THANK YOU FOR SMOKING

236
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,831
- It stopped.
- What's the address?

237
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:04,381
Thirty-eight Almagro,
but I don't know what floor.

238
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:06,788
She waved.

239
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:09,572
She knows we're here.

240
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:11,492
I don't care.

241
00:22:11,557 --> 00:22:13,565
Where to now?

242
00:22:13,637 --> 00:22:15,743
Montalban, and thank you.

243
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,768
Ladies, there's something
for you to lean on.

244
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:05,281
Hope it does you more good
than it did me.

245
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:08,386
Here's your food,
and that's to sleep on.

246
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:11,043
You can shit on it all you like.

247
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:13,666
Hey.jump here.jump!

248
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:16,388
She won't jump. She hates it.

249
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,175
Well, back to my waiting.

250
00:23:38,858 --> 00:23:40,931
Number 38 Almagro.

251
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,430
Number 38... Almagro.
Let's see.

252
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:54,467
Almagro... Almagro...
Almagro.

253
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,889
31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 38.

254
00:23:58,924 --> 00:24:00,833
41 0-0430.

255
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:04,225
Of course!

256
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:09,251
Of course. It's the same one
who insulted me this morning.

257
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,726
Hello.

258
00:24:14,797 --> 00:24:18,888
I'm the mother
of the notorious ''Crossroads Killer.''

259
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,733
When my son comes home
after one of his famous crimes...

260
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,100
his clothes arejust filthy.

261
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:29,127
Where are the clothes
your son wore...

262
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:31,270
at the time of the murder?

263
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,071
Right here. Sparkling clean.

264
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:40,652
- No trace of blood.
- Or guts.

265
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:43,053
Unbelievable.

266
00:24:43,118 --> 00:24:45,606
Ecce Homo. It's unbelievable.

267
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:15,367
A group of armed Shiites
was captured here in Madrid today....

268
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:18,605
according to police sources.

269
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:23,463
A local Shiite spokesman
living in Madrid...

270
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:28,110
stated that the commando group
was acting on its own...

271
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:32,335
without any connection
to the Shiite community.

272
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:36,270
The same police sources...

273
00:25:36,338 --> 00:25:38,509
promise to release
additional information...

274
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,433
within a few hours...

275
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,532
after the interrogations
are completed.

276
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:47,848
Oh, my book!

277
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:17,969
Ivan, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.

278
00:26:18,037 --> 00:26:21,485
Leave a message
telling me where and when.

279
00:26:22,517 --> 00:26:25,583
I'm going out to look for you now. Bye.

280
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,054
It's me-- Candela.
I've got to see you.

281
00:26:31,126 --> 00:26:33,875
I'm going out. Call me later.

282
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:37,684
- I'm in trouble.
- So am I. Good-bye.

283
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:41,589
Pepa! Damn it, I need you!

284
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:37,274
- Pepa, it's me.
- That woman!

285
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:39,000
Pepa, answer.

286
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,059
I'm in big trouble.

287
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:49,847
''From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan.''

288
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:55,287
- What are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

289
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,269
Well, make it!

290
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:01,535
- Your mother's too much.
- I'm sorry, Marisa.

291
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,567
- And that slut in the window!
- What slut? Where?

292
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:07,771
Weren't you going to use the phone?
Why don't you use it?

293
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,302
Let's go.

294
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:11,994
Gather everything and let's go.

295
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:48,826
''Something's come up
that concerns us both.

296
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:52,728
I must talk to you
before you leave.''

297
00:29:52,803 --> 00:29:54,658
Throw that away!

298
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,936
God, I hope he called.

299
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:33,636
Pepa, it's 5.:oo A.M.

300
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,254
I'm across from your place,
and you're still not home.

301
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,948
I don't know which end is up
anymore!

302
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:46,723
I can't explain over the phone.

303
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,164
What a pest!

304
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,369
I'll tell you one thing--

305
00:30:51,078 --> 00:30:55,421
I don't understand,
because if you had a problem--

306
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:58,309
You'll feel guilty about this!

307
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,490
- It's you.
- I called a million times.

308
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,414
You're a drag!

309
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,422
Don't say that, or I'll leave.

310
00:31:15,496 --> 00:31:17,350
Come on in.

311
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,805
I've been out all night.

312
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,254
So have I.

313
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,695
Let's have some coffee.

314
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,055
- Going somewhere?
- No. Ivan's leaving me.

315
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,935
- We're doing great.
- My life's a mess.

316
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:30,375
Mine too.

317
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,670
- Problems at work?
- No. I couldn't tell you on the phone.

318
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:36,552
The phone! I just ripped it out!

319
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:38,886
Damn! I'll have to call
the phone company.

320
00:31:38,953 --> 00:31:41,506
Can I stay here?

321
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:43,432
I'm in big trouble, Pepa!

322
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:47,327
Fix the coffee, then we'll talk.
You're a pain today!

323
00:31:48,425 --> 00:31:50,051
What?

324
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:53,417
Don't call me a pain!
I'm feeling very vulnerable.

325
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:59,648
My God.

326
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:05,634
Looks like the work of terrorists.

327
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:08,294
Oh, the phone--

328
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:12,551
This just isn't normal.

329
00:32:13,995 --> 00:32:16,450
God, the cops. I'm dead.

330
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,169
Hello.

331
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:30,152
Open up.
We know you're in there.

332
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,035
- What do you want?
- To see the apartment.

333
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,475
- Which one?
- This one.

334
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,192
- Why?
- To rent it.

335
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:39,530
The real estate agency sent us.

336
00:32:39,597 --> 00:32:41,124
In that case--

337
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:46,631
Come in. The owner
will be back in a minute.

338
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,492
- Carlos.
- Yes, honey?

339
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:54,729
It's too high.

340
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:56,653
Darling, it's a penthouse.

341
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:59,369
- And expensive.
- Super-expensive.

342
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:02,024
But it's a great location.

343
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:05,772
I want a real house,
and this is not a real house.

344
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:07,365
The girl is right.

345
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,610
Don't call me a girl.

346
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,374
Carlos.

347
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,966
Yes, my love?

348
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,895
You call this great too?

349
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,334
Christ.

350
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:26,087
Pepa is really something.

351
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,877
Let's go. Come on.

352
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,851
Drop that! You're a cop, right?

353
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:37,863
My Carlos a cop?
Very funny!

354
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,311
I'm no cop.

355
00:33:39,377 --> 00:33:40,904
Isn't that your father?

356
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,628
Nice people don't touch
what is not theirs.

357
00:33:43,697 --> 00:33:45,071
Why is this here?

358
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:46,512
I don't know.

359
00:33:46,577 --> 00:33:49,873
- Do you know her?
- That's Pepa.

360
00:33:49,938 --> 00:33:51,629
You know Pepa?

361
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,673
Not personally, no.

362
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:55,175
Well, here I am.

363
00:33:57,682 --> 00:33:59,176
You know who I am?

364
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:02,189
Did you see the bed?

365
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:04,746
I think so, ma'am.
You know who I am?

366
00:34:04,818 --> 00:34:08,331
Since last night.
But don't call me ma'am.

367
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,994
Ivan sent you for his bag?

368
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:14,027
- No, the realtor sent us.
- What a coincidence.

369
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,231
I'm glad to meet you anyway.

370
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,634
- This is Marisa.
- Who?

371
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,074
Oh, hello.

372
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,568
I'm his fiancée.

373
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,393
Very nice.
I'm his father's ex-lover.

374
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,834
Pepa, listen--

375
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,274
This is Candela.

376
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,031
Pleased to meet you.

377
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,148
Carlos, please.

378
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,068
Pardon the mess.
My life's been hectic lately.

379
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,972
Can you fix telephones?

380
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:40,044
I... can try.

381
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:42,157
Come with me.

382
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:45,196
This one's out of order...

383
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:48,084
and I'm expecting a call
from your dad.

384
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,004
Candela, make some coffee.

385
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,280
We have to go.

386
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:53,204
Yeah. Good idea.

387
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:55,244
Don't be rude.
This is my house.

388
00:34:55,318 --> 00:34:57,325
We've got to talk.

389
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:58,925
It can't be that urgent!

390
00:34:58,998 --> 00:35:00,853
- Have you any tools?
- Yes, in the kitchen.

391
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:02,674
I'll go get them.

392
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,097
Is this any time for repairs?

393
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:10,133
Don't you recognize her?

394
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:13,232
She was in the phone booth
last night.

395
00:35:14,455 --> 00:35:15,884
I hadn't noticed.

396
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:20,213
If you don't want me here, say so.

397
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:22,189
Who says I don't?

398
00:35:22,264 --> 00:35:25,363
I just learned
that my ex-lover has a son.

399
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,123
And he's here.

400
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,850
Shouldn't he come first?

401
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,830
But I've got a big problem.

402
00:35:30,904 --> 00:35:33,010
Okay, we'll talk.

403
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:37,584
Let me know when we're leaving.

404
00:35:37,656 --> 00:35:39,183
It won't take long.

405
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:40,685
Here.

406
00:35:41,657 --> 00:35:43,664
Where's Ivan?

407
00:35:43,737 --> 00:35:45,112
I don't know.

408
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:48,144
Why doesn't he call?
I need to talk to him.

409
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:50,072
I don't see him very much.

410
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:53,912
Don't lie.
He's taking a trip with your mom.

411
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:58,451
My mother thinks
he's going with you.

412
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:00,856
Then it's someone else.

413
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:04,696
So that's why
he didn't sleep at his studio!

414
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:09,464
- How do you know?
- I spent all night keeping watch.

415
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,905
You must think I'm crazy.

416
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:15,314
No. You're just nervous
from a lack of sleep.

417
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:17,110
You didn't know about me?

418
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:19,351
Never. I had no idea.

419
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:21,426
Ivan never tells me anything.

420
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:23,354
I just find things out.

421
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:27,511
Last night,
when I saw your picture--

422
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,882
''From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan.''

423
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:31,857
That's how I knew.

424
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,766
He never says anything,
never admits anything...

425
00:36:35,837 --> 00:36:38,008
never criticizes.

426
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:41,372
Do you think I didn't know
he was cheating?

427
00:36:41,437 --> 00:36:44,252
Sure, but I put up with it.

428
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:48,092
I tried talking to him civilly,
but it didn't work.

429
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:52,892
So I begged him not to lie
about important things...

430
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:56,405
and to tell me
if he stopped loving me.

431
00:36:57,437 --> 00:37:00,951
Last week, I finally got him
to admit he didn't love me.

432
00:37:01,854 --> 00:37:03,829
It was like pulling teeth.

433
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:08,179
Thanks for listening,
since your father wouldn't.

434
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:11,865
Waiting for his call
had me ready to choke myself...

435
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,974
with the telephone cord.

436
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:17,395
- So I ripped out the phone.
- You did right.

437
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:20,603
She's gonna jump!

438
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,329
Your friend's jumping!

439
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,527
She jumped!

440
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:28,535
Help!

441
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,615
Carlos, be careful!

442
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:37,470
Don't let go of me, Pepa!

443
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:41,311
Oh, my God! I can't do it.

444
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:43,285
Come on! Pull!

445
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,425
You could have killed yourself!

446
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:00,734
That was the idea!

447
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:03,863
I'm desperate.

448
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:07,484
So am I, and I don't go
jumping off terraces.

449
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:11,231
Young people don't know
how to fight for things.

450
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:14,113
You think life is all pleasure.

451
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:15,705
Well, it isn't.

452
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:18,529
You have to suffer a lot.

453
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:22,424
Pepa, please.
This isn't the right time.

454
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:24,769
Yes. I'm sorry.

455
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,395
It's because you scared me.

456
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:29,020
- Ivan--
- Yes?

457
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:32,572
I mean Carlos. Bring me
my tranquilizers from the kitchen.

458
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,267
I'm in big trouble.

459
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,348
I can see that.

460
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,755
Carlos, do you love me?

461
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,828
Please, not now.

462
00:38:52,293 --> 00:38:54,432
Okay, what's wrong?

463
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:58,429
Three months ago,
I spent a weekend with a guy.

464
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:03,236
I didn't know his name or anything,
but after he left...

465
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:05,789
I couldn't get him out of my mind.

466
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:07,388
What happened that weekend?

467
00:39:07,462 --> 00:39:11,237
Nothing special.
We fucked the whole weekend.

468
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:15,558
Just thinking about it
gives me goose bumps.

469
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:18,589
It was like a revelation.

470
00:39:18,662 --> 00:39:21,826
Like making love
for the first time.

471
00:39:24,454 --> 00:39:25,829
I loved it.

472
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:28,765
Sex means a lot at your age.

473
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:32,767
Because his life
is always in danger...

474
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,687
he's more intense
than other guys.

475
00:39:36,424 --> 00:39:39,294
I knew he'd be back,
and I'd agree to anything.

476
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,255
He came back?

477
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,103
Two weeks ago...
with two more guys.

478
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:47,780
- You let them all stay?
- They were with him.

479
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:51,494
- They took advantage.
- Wait, wait.

480
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:54,376
I noticed something weird about them...

481
00:39:54,441 --> 00:39:57,256
and he confessed
that they were Shiite terrorists.

482
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:59,655
I flipped. I really did.

483
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:03,017
I knew it could be dangerous,
but I didn't think about it.

484
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:05,732
What's worse, they had weapons...

485
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:07,809
and were planning
to attack somewhere.

486
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:09,572
Then I said to him...

487
00:40:09,642 --> 00:40:12,609
''You should have
told me about this.''

488
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:14,689
That's when I realized it was a ploy.

489
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:17,545
He didn't love me. He used me.

490
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:21,094
Gazpacho.

491
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,193
You didn't call the cops?

492
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:26,600
Delicious.

493
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:30,595
How could I?
I was a hostage in my own house.

494
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:32,936
- They were arrested yesterday?
- Yes.

495
00:40:33,003 --> 00:40:37,673
- The ones on TV?
- I threw out all their stuff...

496
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,594
but if they confess
where they were living--

497
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,961
If they're tortured,
they might tell.

498
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:44,646
They probably won't tell.

499
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:48,065
But if they do, the cops will
want me for collaborating...

500
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,442
and you for not alerting them.

501
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:53,542
In my house,
I collaborate with whomever I want.

502
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:55,587
I didn't know where to go.

503
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,311
I couldn't face my folks.

504
00:40:58,381 --> 00:41:00,803
It's bad enough
that I became a model.

505
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:03,594
You need to see a lawyer.

506
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,957
I'll arrange for that.
You can't leave now.

507
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:09,324
- Go to Paulina Morales.
- The feminist?

508
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,365
A feminist?

509
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:14,634
As a woman,
she'll take a personal interest.

510
00:41:14,702 --> 00:41:17,964
I'll go change.
Then give me her address.

511
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:25,668
Why are men like that?

512
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,854
I really don't understand.

513
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:35,215
I couldn't stand to be
with a man right now.

514
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:37,134
That's all I needed!

515
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,414
Help me!

516
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:53,132
- What happened?
- Nothing. She fell asleep.

517
00:41:53,201 --> 00:41:54,575
So suddenly?

518
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,437
The strangest things
can happen suddenly.

519
00:41:58,513 --> 00:42:00,815
You should know, Candela.

520
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:02,736
It's true.

521
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:04,176
But a minute ago--

522
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:07,536
A minute ago
she wanted to go home...

523
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:09,773
but since you ignored her...

524
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,914
she got depressed
and had some gazpacho.

525
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:15,151
That made her fall asleep?

526
00:42:15,218 --> 00:42:18,633
Yes. It was spiked with barbiturates.

527
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:23,407
Sorry.

528
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,231
We could call a doctor.

529
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:30,186
- What kind of barbiturates?
- Morphidal.

530
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,811
- How many?
- Twenty-five or thirty.

531
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:35,533
She'll have a good sleep.

532
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,515
Why did you do that?
Were you trying to kill yourself too?

533
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,152
It was for your dad.
He loves gazpacho.

534
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,554
It's no excuse...

535
00:42:57,621 --> 00:43:02,029
but after waiting for hours,
I just lost control.

536
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:03,955
That's what happened to me.

537
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:05,930
It could happen to anyone.

538
00:43:09,781 --> 00:43:11,952
Don't get me wrong.

539
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:16,528
I didn't want to kill him--
just to make him stay.

540
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:19,729
I meant to throw it, but--

541
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,653
I understand perfectly.

542
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:24,369
Thanks. The lawyer's address?

543
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,293
Thirty-one Castellana.

544
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:28,213
Do you mind staying?

545
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:30,613
The house is so full of women.

546
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:34,127
- I'll stay as long as you like.
- Thanks. And fix the phone?

547
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:37,494
- Are you okay?
- A bit shaken, but--

548
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,730
Don't let her near the ledge.
See you later.

549
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:41,555
Forget it.

550
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,676
Hi, Ana.

551
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:02,132
Look what fell down from the sky.

552
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:04,852
It's mine. Thanks.

553
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:06,579
It seemed strange--just one.

554
00:44:08,185 --> 00:44:09,592
Be more careful!

555
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:12,145
Ana was arguing with her boyfriend...

556
00:44:12,218 --> 00:44:14,803
and it almost hit her head.

557
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:25,589
- You again!
- Hope you don't mind.

558
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:27,219
Thirty-one Castellana.

559
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,552
I'm glad to see you.

560
00:44:30,618 --> 00:44:32,952
My girlfriend loved the autograph.

561
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:37,012
When I tell her I saw you again,
she'll think we--

562
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,501
Do you have eyedrops?

563
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,940
No. Sorry.

564
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:06,331
We could buy some.

565
00:45:06,396 --> 00:45:07,706
That's okay.

566
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:10,675
Why didn't I think of eyedrops?

567
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,658
What a dope!

568
00:45:20,957 --> 00:45:22,867
It's working.

569
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:26,013
Forget about them.

570
00:45:26,078 --> 00:45:30,334
But they're hijacking
the 1 0:00 P.M. Stockholm flight...

571
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:33,365
and taking it to Beirut
to free some Shiite prisoners.

572
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:37,530
That flight will be fully booked.
We must report it.

573
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,454
Then the cops will get me too!

574
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,446
I'll talk fast
so they can't trace the call.

575
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:45,975
Yeah. You have a way with words.

576
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,189
Police precinct. Hello.

577
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,814
Tonight's 1 0:00 P.M. flight...

578
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,888
to Stockholm...

579
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,448
will be hijacked by Shiite terrorists.

580
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,731
Thanks.

581
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:24,993
Here we are.

582
00:46:25,058 --> 00:46:26,913
Don't tell anyone I cried.

583
00:46:26,978 --> 00:46:28,833
It'll be our secret.

584
00:46:28,898 --> 00:46:30,327
Good.

585
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,494
- Here?
- Where it says ''sign.''

586
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:42,264
Is Paulina Morales in?

587
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:44,674
She's not seeing anyone this afternoon.

588
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:47,870
It's urgent. It won't take long.

589
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:50,328
Come on. You can arrange it.

590
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:53,696
- Okay. Come on.
- Thanks.

591
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:55,932
See you later.

592
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,114
Wait here.

593
00:47:05,796 --> 00:47:07,170
I'm coming.

594
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:08,611
Can I use the phone?

595
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:10,105
Okay.

596
00:47:18,597 --> 00:47:21,085
Is Paulina there?

597
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:22,750
Ivan?

598
00:47:24,997 --> 00:47:26,907
I'm going crazy.

599
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:40,385
''Stockholm.''

600
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,269
You can go in.

601
00:47:58,951 --> 00:48:02,148
- Of all the nerve!
- She said I could come in.

602
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:04,387
I'm in a hurry.

603
00:48:04,456 --> 00:48:08,285
Don't worry.
This won't take long.

604
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,335
May I sit down?

605
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,255
Go ahead.

606
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:15,175
What's the problem?

607
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:18,208
A friend of mine is in trouble.

608
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:19,328
A ''friend.''

609
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:23,398
She got involved
with a Shiite terrorist.

610
00:48:24,841 --> 00:48:27,394
I'm dying to smoke. May I?

611
00:48:30,922 --> 00:48:32,809
The shoe is hers.

612
00:48:33,834 --> 00:48:37,663
Anyway, he showed up
with two more Shiites.

613
00:48:37,738 --> 00:48:38,883
Three Shiites.

614
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:41,737
All three just moved in.

615
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:43,657
Now they've been arrested...

616
00:48:43,722 --> 00:48:46,210
and she's scared shitless.

617
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,778
So she needs a lawyer.

618
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,850
Why come to me?

619
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:53,509
- You're a feminist.
- So?

620
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,674
This is clear-cut chauvinism.

621
00:48:56,748 --> 00:49:00,010
I'm going on a trip.
I'll recommend a colleague.

622
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:02,247
There's not much to be done.

623
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:05,283
She must turn herself in,
go to jail...

624
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:08,618
and let the jury decide her case.

625
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,192
- I don't understand.
- She's committed a crime.

626
00:49:13,261 --> 00:49:17,701
Her only crime was falling in love
and being afraid.

627
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:19,660
I'd do the same.

628
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,351
I'm sure.

629
00:49:22,477 --> 00:49:24,484
I don't believe this!

630
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:27,873
And whom were you crying for?
Your friend?

631
00:49:28,941 --> 00:49:30,883
Not over her.

632
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,649
You see?

633
00:49:32,718 --> 00:49:34,409
Aren't you the victim?

634
00:49:34,478 --> 00:49:36,867
Yes. I've also been cheated on.

635
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:38,251
By a terrorist?

636
00:49:39,214 --> 00:49:41,069
You could say that.

637
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:43,436
But not a Shiite. He's from Madrid.

638
00:49:43,502 --> 00:49:46,885
I don't give advice to the lovelorn.

639
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:49,926
You're certainly no lawyer,
you bitch!

640
00:49:49,999 --> 00:49:52,366
Leave, or I'll call the police!

641
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:01,262
Was it helpful?

642
00:50:01,328 --> 00:50:03,183
Yes. I feel much better.

643
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:04,622
Good.

644
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:10,663
What's this doing here?

645
00:50:10,736 --> 00:50:13,867
A kid brought it
and said it's for Mr. Ivan.

646
00:50:13,936 --> 00:50:18,344
If he wants it, let him come upstairs
and show his face!

647
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,067
Fine. Do you need some help?

648
00:50:21,136 --> 00:50:23,525
No, I don't!

649
00:50:25,553 --> 00:50:28,902
Pepa, I'm here in Madrid with you.
That's all I need.

650
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:33,931
I'm also with you, and I'm so happy
to see you write this card. Pepa.

651
00:50:39,858 --> 00:50:41,451
He called?

652
00:50:45,138 --> 00:50:46,993
Yeah. I answered.

653
00:50:47,058 --> 00:50:48,432
Well? Give me that!

654
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:52,689
- I shouldn't read your postcards.
- Never mind. What did he say?

655
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:56,072
He's too embarrassed to see you,
because...

656
00:50:56,147 --> 00:50:58,002
you know who I am.

657
00:50:58,067 --> 00:50:59,562
How sensitive of him!

658
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:01,490
I don't want to see him either...

659
00:51:01,556 --> 00:51:05,004
but if he wants his damn suitcase...

660
00:51:05,076 --> 00:51:07,280
he'll have to come and get it!

661
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:10,130
- How are the girls?
- Fine.

662
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:11,571
Where's Candela?

663
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:13,327
In your room.

664
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:14,770
Did anything happen?

665
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:18,132
No, no. Did you see the lawyer?

666
00:51:18,196 --> 00:51:21,164
Yes. I'll tell you about it later.

667
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:30,445
You mind my wearing your dress?

668
00:51:30,517 --> 00:51:33,484
Keep it. It looks nicer on you.

669
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,853
Don't lose it again.
My shoes don't fit you.

670
00:51:36,918 --> 00:51:39,503
- You saw the lawyer?
- Yes.

671
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,388
We're taking a trip.

672
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:46,959
Running from the law
like two fugitives?

673
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:51,122
It's best if we take a vacation
away from Madrid.

674
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,045
I sure need one.

675
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,499
I knew they'd lock me up...

676
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:57,430
and get you for hiding me.

677
00:51:57,495 --> 00:51:59,350
Nothing will happen.

678
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:01,423
We'll come back in a week.

679
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:04,462
You'll go to court
and tell everything...

680
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:07,023
except for the fucking,
and that'll be that.

681
00:52:07,096 --> 00:52:11,024
Really? Don't lie to me.
You know I'm naive.

682
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:13,583
The lawyer said not to worry....

683
00:52:13,656 --> 00:52:17,268
just to stay in touch with her.

684
00:52:17,336 --> 00:52:19,191
I'm causing so much trouble...

685
00:52:19,256 --> 00:52:22,224
as if you don't have
enough of your own.

686
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:24,785
Let's water the plants now.

687
00:52:24,857 --> 00:52:26,864
Then we'll pack our bags.

688
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:32,568
''Dr.J. Pardo.

689
00:52:32,633 --> 00:52:36,146
Test results on patient Pepa Marcos. ''

690
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:37,778
Christ!

691
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:45,588
- What about the animals?
- I don't know.

692
00:52:45,658 --> 00:52:49,367
Your stepson was
snooping around all day, spying.

693
00:52:49,434 --> 00:52:52,249
It's quite natural,
but he won't find much.

694
00:52:52,315 --> 00:52:54,322
Relax. Let me do that.

695
00:52:54,394 --> 00:52:55,604
Why?

696
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:58,009
- You feel okay?
- Sure.

697
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:01,752
You two clean the cage
while I water.

698
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:08,721
Poor things.
You're going to miss me.

699
00:53:08,795 --> 00:53:10,650
You're depressed.

700
00:53:10,715 --> 00:53:13,366
Just like me.

701
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:15,924
But you'll come along when I move.

702
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:17,851
I won't leave you alone.

703
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:21,265
I'd be a fine one to abandon you.

704
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,751
She's out cold. Let's see.

705
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:31,030
Anyway, who cares?
Too bad for her.

706
00:53:33,437 --> 00:53:34,964
Poor bunnies!

707
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:36,728
Look. Totally dry.

708
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,968
Pepa just has too much on her mind.

709
00:53:39,037 --> 00:53:41,852
Did you ever have rabbits?

710
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,820
Back home I had many.

711
00:53:44,894 --> 00:53:46,749
I know lots about them.

712
00:53:48,254 --> 00:53:51,550
Look how they love turnips.

713
00:53:51,614 --> 00:53:55,870
Carlos, I'm sorry I teased you
about your stuttering.

714
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:58,586
- Sometimes I'm so dumb.
- Forget it.

715
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,662
But you went a little too far.

716
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:03,223
You didn't behave properly.

717
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:06,590
Men keep taking advantage of me.

718
00:54:06,655 --> 00:54:09,950
I always realize it when it's too late.

719
00:54:10,015 --> 00:54:15,067
Look how the Arab world treated me.

720
00:54:15,136 --> 00:54:17,558
I sure didn't deserve that.

721
00:54:25,504 --> 00:54:28,221
This is Lucia.
I need to see you.

722
00:54:28,288 --> 00:54:30,776
I can't. I'm leaving town.

723
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:32,442
We have to talk.

724
00:54:32,513 --> 00:54:35,230
About something
that concerns us both.

725
00:54:35,297 --> 00:54:38,494
If you mean Ivan,
I'm not interested.

726
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:40,950
Then why are you
going away with him?

727
00:54:41,025 --> 00:54:42,651
Lady, you're nuts!

728
00:54:42,722 --> 00:54:46,071
Between Ivan and me,
there's nothing but pain.

729
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:49,462
I'm coming anyway.
I know where you live.

730
00:54:49,538 --> 00:54:52,953
For two days everyone
has been saying ''no'' to me.

731
00:54:53,026 --> 00:54:55,296
Now it's my turn to say ''no.''

732
00:54:55,362 --> 00:54:59,705
I must see Ivan
before he leaves.

733
00:54:59,778 --> 00:55:02,975
Look somewhere else
and leave me alone!

734
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,319
- That was Mom?
- Yes.

735
00:55:04,387 --> 00:55:06,078
Don't be too hard on her.

736
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:07,969
The way she talks--

737
00:55:08,035 --> 00:55:10,337
She's mentally ill.

738
00:55:10,403 --> 00:55:12,509
She threatened to come here.

739
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,035
- She shouldn't see you.
- And me?

740
00:55:15,108 --> 00:55:18,818
Fix Marisa some coffee.
We need to talk.

741
00:55:18,884 --> 00:55:21,851
The lawyer didn't work out.
We got into a fight.

742
00:55:21,924 --> 00:55:23,517
She won't defend her?

743
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:26,370
She'd rather prosecute her.
How'd you meet her?

744
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:27,745
She was Mom's lawyer.

745
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:30,430
I'm not surprised
your mother is sick.

746
00:55:31,492 --> 00:55:34,176
They split up before I was born.

747
00:55:34,244 --> 00:55:36,131
After my birth, she went crazy...

748
00:55:36,196 --> 00:55:37,953
and was placed
in a mental institution.

749
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,743
My grandparents raised me.

750
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:43,840
They wouldn't let Ivan see me.

751
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:45,435
You can look now.

752
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:50,977
Mom was released a year ago.

753
00:55:51,045 --> 00:55:55,104
When she got out,
she wanted to go back to Ivan...

754
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:57,442
but he was with you.

755
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,452
Can you zip me up?

756
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:03,396
So she sued him for millions...

757
00:56:03,462 --> 00:56:06,778
for all the time
she'd been locked up.

758
00:56:06,854 --> 00:56:08,480
Paulina was her lawyer.

759
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:10,405
Your mother doesn't mess around.

760
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,147
Paulina tried to sue Ivan,
but it didn't work.

761
00:56:14,214 --> 00:56:16,037
What an insane story.

762
00:56:16,103 --> 00:56:17,859
Mom hates me.

763
00:56:17,927 --> 00:56:21,440
I represent all her years
without Ivan.

764
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,333
Well, I love you.

765
00:56:23,399 --> 00:56:26,530
You're the only good thing
Ivan ever did.

766
00:56:29,383 --> 00:56:33,028
- Oh, it's you.
- I didn't want to interrupt.

767
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:36,227
- Why so dressed up?
- I'm going out.

768
00:56:36,296 --> 00:56:38,052
Don't mention the lawyer.

769
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,967
- What?
- See if you can wake up Marisa.

770
00:56:41,032 --> 00:56:43,650
- And if not?
- It's up to you.

771
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,470
- Anyway, we're leaving.
- What?

772
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:47,813
- On a trip.
- Where?

773
00:56:47,881 --> 00:56:49,736
- It's a secret.
- We're fugitives.

774
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:52,354
It's better if you don't know.

775
00:56:52,425 --> 00:56:55,108
- But he knows everything.
- Come on.

776
00:57:02,057 --> 00:57:03,551
What if Ivan calls?

777
00:57:04,746 --> 00:57:07,495
Tell him I expect nothing
from him.

778
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:10,245
All I have left from him
is the suitcase...

779
00:57:10,314 --> 00:57:12,136
and I'm getting rid of it now.

780
00:57:13,322 --> 00:57:16,868
No. Don't say anything.

781
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:18,629
Don't get the phone...

782
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:19,713
or the door.

783
00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:20,964
Fine.

784
00:57:22,123 --> 00:57:23,813
I'll be right back.

785
00:57:29,963 --> 00:57:34,055
I overheard about your mom,
and I'm really sorry.

786
00:57:36,044 --> 00:57:37,866
You're a kissing fanatic!

787
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:40,649
Let's give her some coffee.

788
00:57:52,365 --> 00:57:53,991
What's wrong?

789
00:57:54,061 --> 00:57:56,330
Nothing. She's having fun.

790
00:57:58,253 --> 00:58:00,228
I've never seen her like this.

791
00:58:00,302 --> 00:58:03,171
Don't wake her.
She's having a great time.

792
00:58:03,245 --> 00:58:04,969
See her face?

793
00:58:05,038 --> 00:58:07,045
She's having a ball.

794
00:58:08,334 --> 00:58:09,544
Her face!

795
00:58:11,694 --> 00:58:13,221
Look at her lip!

796
00:58:21,934 --> 00:58:25,283
Hi. I've come for my bag.
Pepa said it was here.

797
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,215
That's strange.
A kid brought it down earlier...

798
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:33,134
but when Pepa saw it,
she threw a fit.

799
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,640
- So where's the bag?
- She took it and she said...

800
00:58:37,711 --> 00:58:40,232
''If he wants it,
let him come and get it...

801
00:58:40,304 --> 00:58:41,831
and show his face!''

802
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:43,911
That's what she said.

803
00:58:43,984 --> 00:58:45,413
She's upstairs now.

804
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,626
I'm in a hurry.

805
00:58:49,136 --> 00:58:51,340
She's probably calmed down...

806
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:53,164
but you never know.

807
00:58:53,232 --> 00:58:55,786
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't tell her I was here.

808
00:58:55,857 --> 00:59:00,330
Sir, I'm a jehovah's Witness
and cannot tell lies.

809
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:03,881
Only the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

810
00:59:03,953 --> 00:59:05,262
But if she doesn't ask--

811
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,112
If she asks,
I have to tell the gospel truth.

812
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,738
Good-bye.

813
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,151
I'd like to lie!

814
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:14,284
The bad thing
about my religion is...

815
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:16,361
that we can't.

816
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:27,982
I love the sound of the trumpets
on Judgment Day

817
00:59:29,939 --> 00:59:33,802
Ivan, I have to speak
to you immediately.

818
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:37,225
Leave a message
and tell me when and where.

819
00:59:39,124 --> 00:59:40,880
I can't pick up my bag.

820
00:59:40,948 --> 00:59:43,250
I wanted to talk to you...

821
00:59:43,316 --> 00:59:46,415
but I see you're avoiding me.

822
00:59:46,484 --> 00:59:49,550
I'll try again in a few days...

823
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,889
when you're a bit calmer.

824
00:59:51,956 --> 00:59:55,218
I want you to know
that our years together...

825
00:59:55,284 --> 00:59:58,580
were the best of my life.

826
00:59:59,925 --> 01:00:02,412
I'm not going away
with any woman.

827
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:06,770
Good-bye, sweetheart.

828
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:09,903
I wish you the best
with all my heart.

829
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:14,894
I'm so unhappy

830
01:00:14,966 --> 01:00:18,228
Because you no longer love me

831
01:00:18,294 --> 01:00:21,971
Why should I try
to change your mind

832
01:00:23,926 --> 01:00:28,498
Be happy, my love

833
01:00:28,566 --> 01:00:35,724
For I'll never forget
the love you gave me

834
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:40,750
I'm so unhappy

835
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:46,231
Look at him!

836
01:00:46,296 --> 01:00:47,823
He's nuts!

837
01:01:00,633 --> 01:01:02,259
I'll show her, all right!

838
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:05,678
Pepa, you'll pay dearly
for those three Shiites!

839
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:09,777
I'm not going away
with any women.

840
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:12,151
Good-bye, sweetheart.
I wish you the best--

841
01:01:12,218 --> 01:01:13,974
Liar!

842
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:15,503
Maybe it's true.

843
01:01:15,578 --> 01:01:17,879
He can fool me with everything
but his voice.

844
01:01:17,946 --> 01:01:22,354
I know all his intonations.
I worked long enough with him.

845
01:01:22,426 --> 01:01:24,214
Goddamn phone!

846
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,838
What were you doing?

847
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:30,454
That damn fucking bitch!

848
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:32,694
What did you see in her?

849
01:01:32,763 --> 01:01:34,902
Let's get your luggage.

850
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:36,564
- You did it again.
- Forget it.

851
01:01:36,635 --> 01:01:40,247
Calm down!
Just look at this place.

852
01:01:41,755 --> 01:01:44,789
- The cops!
- Take it easy. Come on.

853
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,162
It's Ivan.
I knew he's no coward.

854
01:01:47,228 --> 01:01:49,235
It's your mother.

855
01:01:49,307 --> 01:01:50,518
- Let's play.
- I can't!

856
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,530
- Should I let her in?
- Yes.

857
01:01:52,604 --> 01:01:55,419
- Read the instructions!
- ''Strategy is--''

858
01:01:55,484 --> 01:01:57,110
Not out loud!

859
01:02:00,221 --> 01:02:03,156
What are you doing here,
traitor?

860
01:02:03,229 --> 01:02:05,978
- Well--
- Carlos, who is it?

861
01:02:06,045 --> 01:02:07,474
I don't know.

862
01:02:07,548 --> 01:02:08,858
It's the police.

863
01:02:10,589 --> 01:02:11,996
What do they want?

864
01:02:13,277 --> 01:02:16,790
We understood.

865
01:02:16,861 --> 01:02:19,000
- Come on.
- Right.

866
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,269
Shut up or I'll smack you.

867
01:02:28,222 --> 01:02:29,629
Good evening.

868
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:32,182
Is she with you?

869
01:02:32,255 --> 01:02:34,197
We met in the elevator.

870
01:02:41,183 --> 01:02:43,550
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

871
01:02:43,615 --> 01:02:47,194
-just discussing the lady's dress.
- It's awful.

872
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,784
- It's just a dress.
- But it's awful.

873
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,262
Maybe she likes it.

874
01:02:51,328 --> 01:02:55,703
Stop acting like a kid
in front of the policemen!

875
01:02:58,848 --> 01:03:01,696
''I love you, need you, want you.''

876
01:03:02,848 --> 01:03:04,823
''Your Ivan.''

877
01:03:04,897 --> 01:03:07,199
May I ask why you're here?

878
01:03:07,265 --> 01:03:09,687
A call was made
from your telephone...

879
01:03:09,761 --> 01:03:11,287
about some terrorists.

880
01:03:11,361 --> 01:03:13,216
Pardon?

881
01:03:13,281 --> 01:03:17,689
Someone called from here
about the Shiite terrorists.

882
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:19,736
See! I told you!

883
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:21,849
Those kids!

884
01:03:21,922 --> 01:03:26,778
There's been some mistake. My phone's
been out of order all day.

885
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,792
She just now pulled it out.

886
01:03:28,866 --> 01:03:31,168
I called her 20 minutes ago.

887
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:33,209
Ignore her. She's a bit crazy.

888
01:03:33,283 --> 01:03:36,250
- What am I charged with?
- Nothing.

889
01:03:36,323 --> 01:03:39,738
We just wanted information
about who called.

890
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:41,120
Who ripped out the phone?

891
01:03:41,187 --> 01:03:43,325
I did. This morning.

892
01:03:43,395 --> 01:03:45,435
So nobody's called
from here today.

893
01:03:45,507 --> 01:03:47,515
Pepa's some talker!

894
01:03:47,588 --> 01:03:48,733
Why?

895
01:03:48,804 --> 01:03:52,382
I was expecting a call.
They didn't call, and I got upset.

896
01:03:52,451 --> 01:03:54,906
Who? Ivan? Where is he?

897
01:03:54,979 --> 01:03:58,143
Shut up. I'll ask the questions.
Well... we will.

898
01:03:58,212 --> 01:04:00,929
Go ahead. Ask her who Ivan is.

899
01:04:00,996 --> 01:04:03,778
- Who's Ivan?
- The cause of this mess...

900
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:06,266
and of the mess
your partner's about to see.

901
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:09,698
He's going to find Marisa.

902
01:04:09,765 --> 01:04:10,910
All right. Explain.

903
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,988
May I sit down?

904
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:17,763
If I'm to bare my soul,
I'd rather be comfortable.

905
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:19,717
I've had a hard day.

906
01:04:19,782 --> 01:04:21,189
Are you comfortable?

907
01:04:21,253 --> 01:04:23,774
I'd be more comfortable
alone with my friends...

908
01:04:23,845 --> 01:04:25,307
playing Strategy.

909
01:04:25,382 --> 01:04:27,902
You can't always
have everything.

910
01:04:27,973 --> 01:04:29,730
We agree on that.

911
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:32,318
Who is this Ivan?

912
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:36,384
He was my lover.
Before that he was with her.

913
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,844
He's my son's father.

914
01:04:38,919 --> 01:04:41,221
Him?
What's he doing here?

915
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:43,359
He came to rent my apartment.

916
01:04:43,431 --> 01:04:44,511
I didn't know.

917
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:47,715
I get the feeling
you're pulling my leg.

918
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:51,078
You think I like
baring my soul to strangers?

919
01:04:51,143 --> 01:04:54,144
Well, you're wrong.
It's humiliating.

920
01:04:54,215 --> 01:04:55,874
Damn it, Mom!

921
01:04:55,944 --> 01:04:58,365
- Candela, get me a drink.
- What kind?

922
01:04:58,439 --> 01:05:00,992
- There's gazpacho.
- Right! Gazpacho!

923
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,493
Let's go.

924
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,917
- Where are you going?
- For gazpacho. Want some?

925
01:05:06,984 --> 01:05:09,766
We're on duty,
but we don't want to be rude--

926
01:05:09,832 --> 01:05:12,069
Gazpacho for everyone.

927
01:05:12,136 --> 01:05:14,241
Is she sleeping?

928
01:05:14,312 --> 01:05:16,996
Like a log.
She's Carlos' fiancée.

929
01:05:17,065 --> 01:05:20,262
She was tired.
You want me to wake her up?

930
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:21,987
Not yet.

931
01:05:22,057 --> 01:05:25,800
Why don't you sit down?
I'm getting a stiff neck.

932
01:05:33,866 --> 01:05:36,004
We have nothing against you--

933
01:05:36,074 --> 01:05:37,504
Thanks a lot.

934
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:40,361
Without being inquisitive...

935
01:05:40,427 --> 01:05:42,882
you must admit
this is a little weird.

936
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:44,897
A charred bedroom...

937
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,597
a broken phone,
a smashed window--

938
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:49,122
It's been weird, all right.

939
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,562
Okay. Start at the beginning.

940
01:05:51,627 --> 01:05:53,864
And make it clear,
concise, and fair.

941
01:05:53,931 --> 01:05:55,076
I don't know if I can.

942
01:05:55,147 --> 01:05:58,115
I'm too hurt to be clear,
concise, and fair.

943
01:05:58,188 --> 01:05:59,081
Words!

944
01:05:59,148 --> 01:06:02,214
-just the facts.
- Okay.

945
01:06:02,284 --> 01:06:04,651
I lived here... with Ivan.

946
01:06:04,716 --> 01:06:08,197
We loved each other.
At least, I loved him.

947
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:12,011
After months of trying
to keep our love together...

948
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:15,076
we split up a week ago.

949
01:06:15,148 --> 01:06:19,524
He told me to pack his bags.
He'd be taking a trip...

950
01:06:19,597 --> 01:06:21,222
with another woman.

951
01:06:21,293 --> 01:06:24,010
- He said that?
- He never travels alone.

952
01:06:24,078 --> 01:06:27,755
Remember, these two
for the cops. An extra dose.

953
01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:29,578
Careful.

954
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:31,500
This is too warm.

955
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,036
Carlos, my God!

956
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:39,820
In front of your mother,
the cops, your fiancée!

957
01:06:39,886 --> 01:06:41,163
Aren't you afraid?

958
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,303
Go on, please.

959
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:46,092
So I packed up his stuff
and went to work.

960
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:48,909
When I came back,
the house was like this.

961
01:06:48,975 --> 01:06:51,593
Except for the phone,
which I did.

962
01:06:51,663 --> 01:06:54,184
The suitcase was gone...

963
01:06:54,255 --> 01:06:56,906
and the bed was all burned.

964
01:06:56,976 --> 01:07:01,483
They're taking very long.
Go. Check.

965
01:07:02,992 --> 01:07:05,676
They're probably kissing.

966
01:07:05,744 --> 01:07:08,111
- What about Marisa?
- She'd better wake up.

967
01:07:08,176 --> 01:07:10,478
Takes after his father.

968
01:07:11,473 --> 01:07:13,840
- Now, who's that?
- Yeah?

969
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:15,912
- Telephone repair. And you?
- Police.

970
01:07:15,984 --> 01:07:18,602
- Your I.D.?
- And yours?

971
01:07:26,577 --> 01:07:28,366
Are you the lady
who called this morning?

972
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:32,230
Yes. Here's the phone,
and here's the plug.

973
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:35,371
I reached her here by phone
20 minutes ago.

974
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,067
There she goes again!

975
01:07:37,138 --> 01:07:39,026
Not on this phone.

976
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:40,813
Let's get to the point.

977
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:44,657
Do you know
any Shiite terrorists?

978
01:07:44,723 --> 01:07:47,178
Shut up! He's asking her!

979
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:49,520
I didn't know Madrid had any.

980
01:07:50,802 --> 01:07:52,297
Do you know them?

981
01:07:52,371 --> 01:07:55,535
Not me. I'm not into politics.

982
01:07:55,603 --> 01:07:57,610
Sure, man.
They were on TV today!

983
01:07:57,683 --> 01:08:00,650
- Shut up!
- You want the TV on?

984
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:03,506
I'm not interested in Shiites.

985
01:08:03,572 --> 01:08:05,034
Ma'am, what about you?

986
01:08:05,107 --> 01:08:08,523
Pepa and I have
important things to discuss.

987
01:08:08,596 --> 01:08:09,708
Men, right?

988
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,057
What's more important?

989
01:08:11,124 --> 01:08:13,328
Fine. We'll talk about men.

990
01:08:16,053 --> 01:08:18,955
Is Ivan involved
with these terrorists?

991
01:08:20,308 --> 01:08:24,051
- Relax.
- Ivan?

992
01:08:24,117 --> 01:08:26,572
I don't know.
He's hidden so many things from me.

993
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:28,401
Can you give me his address...

994
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,026
or phone number?

995
01:08:31,093 --> 01:08:34,868
He has no phone.
And he's not home.

996
01:08:34,934 --> 01:08:37,039
I told you he's leaving town.

997
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:38,637
Try the airport.

998
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:42,379
The airport? Where's he going?

999
01:09:05,816 --> 01:09:07,376
Where is he going?

1000
01:09:07,448 --> 01:09:11,223
To Stockholm... tonight.
With Paulina Morales.

1001
01:09:11,288 --> 01:09:13,263
Stockholm!

1002
01:09:13,336 --> 01:09:15,670
Why didn't you say so before?

1003
01:09:15,736 --> 01:09:18,289
Because I just figured it out.

1004
01:09:19,257 --> 01:09:22,191
Now I understand it all--

1005
01:09:22,264 --> 01:09:23,825
The phone call.

1006
01:09:23,897 --> 01:09:27,541
What an idiot I am!
Why didn't I see it before?

1007
01:09:28,921 --> 01:09:31,191
Your lawyer
played it beautifully.

1008
01:09:31,257 --> 01:09:34,901
You didn't know
they'd be hijacking that flight?

1009
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:38,643
The Shiites?

1010
01:09:41,882 --> 01:09:45,657
The whole country knows.
It was on TV.

1011
01:09:45,722 --> 01:09:48,177
But the tip
came from this phone.

1012
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,934
I want to know
who the hell called...

1013
01:09:51,003 --> 01:09:53,337
or I'll haul you all in!

1014
01:09:54,554 --> 01:09:57,238
Why aren't you at the airport?

1015
01:09:57,307 --> 01:10:00,624
There are more cops there
than passengers.

1016
01:10:01,659 --> 01:10:04,147
I don't know what's going on...

1017
01:10:04,219 --> 01:10:06,259
but if you don't start talking--

1018
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:09,015
Chief, this stuff has been spiked.

1019
01:10:11,516 --> 01:10:13,458
What's in the gazpacho?

1020
01:10:13,532 --> 01:10:16,282
Tomatoes, cucumbers...

1021
01:10:16,348 --> 01:10:19,163
bell pepper, onion...

1022
01:10:19,228 --> 01:10:20,690
one garlic clove...

1023
01:10:22,621 --> 01:10:25,850
oil, salt, vinegar...

1024
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:28,284
some day-old bread, and water.

1025
01:10:28,348 --> 01:10:30,869
The secret's in mixing it right.

1026
01:10:30,941 --> 01:10:33,592
Ivan loves the way I mix it.

1027
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:34,937
I made it for him.

1028
01:10:36,605 --> 01:10:38,296
You collect weapons?

1029
01:10:38,365 --> 01:10:39,293
Get back!

1030
01:10:40,062 --> 01:10:43,706
Move back. I don't want
to hurt the kids.

1031
01:10:43,774 --> 01:10:46,392
Is Ivan really going
to Stockholm?

1032
01:10:46,462 --> 01:10:49,179
It's just a hunch,
but I'm pretty sure.

1033
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:51,418
What did you have to tell him?

1034
01:10:51,487 --> 01:10:53,559
Nothing, now.

1035
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:56,478
I just want to forget him.

1036
01:10:56,542 --> 01:10:59,259
And you should do the same.

1037
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:02,010
In the hospital,
I had forgotten him.

1038
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:04,600
I didn't remember anything.

1039
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:06,232
Until suddenly...

1040
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:10,362
one night,
I heard his voice on TV.

1041
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,319
I didn't recognize his face...

1042
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:14,424
just his voice.

1043
01:11:14,496 --> 01:11:16,634
He was telling a woman
he loved her.

1044
01:11:16,703 --> 01:11:20,478
I felt a spasm inside me.

1045
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:23,959
I remembered all the times
he's said that to me.

1046
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:28,192
I regained my sanity
and my memory.

1047
01:11:28,257 --> 01:11:29,686
From that moment on...

1048
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:32,957
I acted as if I had been cured...

1049
01:11:33,024 --> 01:11:35,064
and they released me.

1050
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:37,821
If you're cured,
stop aiming at me.

1051
01:11:37,889 --> 01:11:41,784
But I'm not cured.

1052
01:11:41,858 --> 01:11:44,957
I faked it, and I fooled them.

1053
01:11:45,026 --> 01:11:48,539
I can only forget him
by killing him.

1054
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:51,545
How will you do that?

1055
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:53,113
At the airport.

1056
01:11:53,186 --> 01:11:57,114
The airport is full of cops.
You heard him.

1057
01:11:57,186 --> 01:11:58,713
I'll manage.

1058
01:11:59,427 --> 01:12:01,118
Now that you know--

1059
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:04,034
Let's drink a toast.

1060
01:12:15,204 --> 01:12:16,960
Drink!

1061
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:18,714
You too.

1062
01:12:30,021 --> 01:12:31,963
Oh, my eyes!

1063
01:12:40,549 --> 01:12:41,727
My eyes!

1064
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:47,679
She left the door open!

1065
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,692
The door!

1066
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:03,814
Take me to the airport,
please.

1067
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:05,373
Sorry. I have a date.

1068
01:13:05,446 --> 01:13:07,007
Take me!

1069
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,730
- What the hell is that?
- A gun. Let's go.

1070
01:13:09,799 --> 01:13:11,457
My girlfriend will be mad.

1071
01:13:11,527 --> 01:13:15,783
Not as mad as I'll be.
Quick, to Stockholm!

1072
01:13:24,904 --> 01:13:27,293
Right under my nose!

1073
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,678
Did you see that?

1074
01:13:28,744 --> 01:13:30,566
Come on. After them!

1075
01:13:32,072 --> 01:13:33,730
You again! Great!

1076
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,256
We're meant for each other!

1077
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:38,085
Whom do we follow today?

1078
01:13:38,153 --> 01:13:40,389
- That motorcycle!
- That Harley!

1079
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:44,646
I'll do my best.

1080
01:13:44,713 --> 01:13:46,175
To the airport!

1081
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:48,322
Blow on my eyes.

1082
01:13:48,393 --> 01:13:51,906
That lady is crazy,
and she carries two guns.

1083
01:13:51,978 --> 01:13:55,327
- Why did she take Ambite?
- Because she's in a hurry.

1084
01:13:55,402 --> 01:13:58,272
Ah! Eyedrops!

1085
01:13:58,347 --> 01:14:00,234
Anything else, ladies?

1086
01:14:00,298 --> 01:14:04,227
No.just step on it.
That lady is dangerous.

1087
01:14:04,299 --> 01:14:07,201
No lady's dangerous
if you know how to handle her.

1088
01:14:07,275 --> 01:14:09,609
- There they are.
- I've got them.

1089
01:14:09,675 --> 01:14:10,568
I can't see.

1090
01:14:10,635 --> 01:14:13,799
He can never say ''no.''

1091
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:16,714
Ana, that lady has two guns,
and she's a nut.

1092
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,169
Look what she did to me!

1093
01:14:19,244 --> 01:14:22,277
You think I go around
like this for fun?

1094
01:14:22,348 --> 01:14:24,967
She's capable of anything!

1095
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,872
My ass is the only one
allowed on that bike.

1096
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:31,144
I'm fed up.

1097
01:14:31,212 --> 01:14:33,634
I'm gonna get myself
some quick cash...

1098
01:14:33,709 --> 01:14:35,170
buy myself his bike and split.

1099
01:14:35,244 --> 01:14:36,521
With a bike...

1100
01:14:36,589 --> 01:14:38,498
who needs a man?

1101
01:14:38,572 --> 01:14:41,387
Learning mechanics
is easier than learning male psychology.

1102
01:14:42,413 --> 01:14:44,834
You can figure out a bike...

1103
01:14:44,909 --> 01:14:47,757
but you can never
figure out a man.

1104
01:14:48,781 --> 01:14:50,920
She's going for his balls!

1105
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:53,543
I think she's just
trying to hang on.

1106
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:55,981
Fresh out of the mental ward...

1107
01:14:56,046 --> 01:14:57,802
and she looks
like a professional biker.

1108
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:14,190
Be careful! She's crazy!

1109
01:15:14,255 --> 01:15:15,564
And she has a gun!

1110
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,126
Bitch!

1111
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:19,784
Get down!

1112
01:15:27,472 --> 01:15:30,440
Shut up, idiot women!

1113
01:15:37,488 --> 01:15:39,343
Leave my man alone!

1114
01:15:58,706 --> 01:16:01,073
Can't you go any faster?

1115
01:16:01,138 --> 01:16:03,658
Lady, this thing is a relic.

1116
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,600
A relic?
Just remember this gun!

1117
01:16:06,674 --> 01:16:08,104
Okay! Don't shoot!

1118
01:16:16,627 --> 01:16:18,515
Don't you sell guns?

1119
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:20,205
I don't need them.

1120
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:22,032
What if you're held up?

1121
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,922
I avoid danger, just like now.

1122
01:16:23,987 --> 01:16:27,599
Sorry, ladies.
The chase is over.

1123
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:31,726
Please, just take us
to the airport somehow.

1124
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:34,447
I'm a taxi driver,
not a bounty hunter.

1125
01:16:34,516 --> 01:16:37,135
I warned you
she was a dangerous woman.

1126
01:16:37,205 --> 01:16:38,928
He said he could deal.

1127
01:16:58,806 --> 01:17:00,147
Right here.

1128
01:17:03,606 --> 01:17:04,882
Thanks.

1129
01:17:10,582 --> 01:17:12,525
Stockholm, please?

1130
01:17:12,598 --> 01:17:14,965
International flights
are over there.

1131
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:02,544
- You're weak, Ivan.
- Yes, sweetheart.

1132
01:18:02,617 --> 01:18:06,098
- Don't agree with me!
- But you're right.

1133
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:09,204
Sometimes I like to be wrong.

1134
01:19:02,462 --> 01:19:06,488
Take me back to the hospital.
That's my home.

1135
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,950
Are you all right?

1136
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,990
Let go.

1137
01:19:32,063 --> 01:19:34,365
You saved my life, darling.

1138
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:38,076
Don't worry.
I don't want anything in return.

1139
01:19:38,144 --> 01:19:40,632
Just one thing.
Tell her to go away!

1140
01:19:41,792 --> 01:19:43,221
Go away!

1141
01:19:46,593 --> 01:19:49,048
Pepa, I'm ashamed.

1142
01:19:49,121 --> 01:19:52,252
I've treated you so badly.

1143
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:54,393
All I wanted was to talk to you.

1144
01:19:54,465 --> 01:19:56,767
I've spent two days waiting...

1145
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,550
looking for you,
leaving messages.

1146
01:19:59,617 --> 01:20:01,505
We can talk tonight.

1147
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:03,544
The trip to Stockholm can wait.

1148
01:20:03,618 --> 01:20:05,952
No. It's too late now.

1149
01:20:06,017 --> 01:20:07,446
Don't hold a grudge.

1150
01:20:07,521 --> 01:20:11,133
Let's have a drink,
now, in the cafeteria.

1151
01:20:12,994 --> 01:20:14,936
Yesterday... this morning,
or even at noon today...

1152
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,766
we could have.

1153
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:18,525
But now it's too late.

1154
01:20:18,594 --> 01:20:20,983
It's been too late
for the past two hours.

1155
01:20:21,058 --> 01:20:25,084
Then why did you come out here?

1156
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,188
Lucia wanted to kill you...

1157
01:20:28,259 --> 01:20:32,220
and I came to stop her.

1158
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:35,357
Since you're out of danger,
I'm leaving.

1159
01:20:36,995 --> 01:20:38,621
Good-bye.

1160
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,448
Home at last!

1161
01:21:05,605 --> 01:21:07,515
The visitors...

1162
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:09,761
are comfortable.

1163
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:12,131
And the kids?

1164
01:21:12,197 --> 01:21:15,514
Candela really manages
to recover quickly.

1165
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:18,208
Hope he's luckier for her
than the Shiites were.

1166
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,993
God, what a mess!

1167
01:21:21,062 --> 01:21:23,168
The maid comes tomorrow.

1168
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:26,021
Better wear shoes
with this mess.

1169
01:21:26,087 --> 01:21:28,291
I wonder which is better...

1170
01:21:28,359 --> 01:21:32,036
slipping on gazpacho,
or cutting myself on the glass.

1171
01:21:32,103 --> 01:21:35,932
The repairman is a doll, but
I'd better save him for Marisa.

1172
01:21:45,032 --> 01:21:47,421
I fell asleep.

1173
01:21:47,496 --> 01:21:48,805
How do you feel?

1174
01:21:48,872 --> 01:21:51,906
Like new. But you don't look so hot.

1175
01:21:51,976 --> 01:21:55,140
Well... I'm going to have a baby.

1176
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:56,769
I didn't know.

1177
01:21:56,841 --> 01:21:58,913
You're the first person
I've told.

1178
01:21:58,984 --> 01:22:01,854
Congratulations!
You should sit here.

1179
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:08,580
I'll explain tomorrow.

1180
01:22:08,649 --> 01:22:10,559
- But--
- Sit down.

1181
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:14,431
You just woke up,
but I haven't slept in two days.

1182
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:18,374
I won't sublet it.

1183
01:22:18,442 --> 01:22:20,133
I love the view.

1184
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:24,425
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

1185
01:22:26,667 --> 01:22:28,227
How long was I asleep?

1186
01:22:28,298 --> 01:22:30,022
Hours!

1187
01:22:30,091 --> 01:22:32,196
You have beautiful skin.

1188
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:36,234
I had a dream.

1189
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:38,852
- A good one?
- I think so.

1190
01:22:40,587 --> 01:22:42,954
I was a virgin this morning...

1191
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:44,645
but I don't think I am now.

1192
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:48,512
- Don't tell me one of these jerks--
- No. It was in my dream!

1193
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,498
Great!

1194
01:22:50,572 --> 01:22:52,580
Actually, you've lost...

1195
01:22:52,652 --> 01:22:54,594
that hard look
that virgins have.

1196
01:22:54,668 --> 01:22:55,650
Virgins are awful.

1197
01:22:55,725 --> 01:23:04,487
If you were onstage
faking a cheap pain

1198
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:07,340
Don't bother to act

1199
01:23:08,301 --> 01:23:12,077
I know that play

1200
01:23:12,142 --> 01:23:14,891
Liar

1201
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:18,187
How well you fit that part

1202
01:23:19,086 --> 01:23:23,210
It would seem after all

1203
01:23:23,278 --> 01:23:27,555
That's the way you are

1204
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:31,754
I was blinded

1205
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:36,198
By your passionate kisses

1206
01:23:36,271 --> 01:23:40,265
You lied coldly

1207
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:44,460
But the curtain
finally came down

1208
01:23:46,096 --> 01:23:48,813
Playacting

1209
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,070
That's what you do best

1210
01:23:53,136 --> 01:23:57,326
A finely rehearsed lie

1211
01:23:57,392 --> 01:24:01,516
A well-turned mockery

1212
01:24:01,584 --> 01:24:05,862
You outdid yourself

1213
01:24:05,937 --> 01:24:09,068
Destroying my heart

1214
01:24:10,097 --> 01:24:14,375
And now that your tears are for real

1215
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:18,760
I only remember your lies

1216
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:23,057
Forgive me
if I don't believe you

1217
01:24:23,122 --> 01:24:27,879
But I think
you're putting on a show

1218
01:24:27,954 --> 01:24:30,988
Don't forget that after all

1219
01:24:31,059 --> 01:24:33,164
I'm supposed to be in the wrong

1220
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:40,592
Playacting

1221
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:44,937
That's what you do best

1222
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:48,078
A finely rehearsed lie

1223
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:53,034
A well-turned mockery

1224
01:24:53,108 --> 01:24:57,386
You outdid yourself

1225
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,388
Destroying my heart

1226
01:25:03,669 --> 01:25:06,604
