00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:26,326
My lonely days are over

171
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,797
Look, Ashley, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:34,566
I was scared that
I was gonna walk out there,

173
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,768
and you were gonna take
one look at me and just... turn around.

174
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,904
I was scaredl was walkin'
into heartache.

175
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:44,841
All those letters, those words,
and you have a picture in your mind.

176
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:51,413
I was scared you'd see me,
and I just wouldn't be that...

177
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,815
picture that you had
in your mind.

178
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:57,951
I figured you walked outta there
and saw my clothes or something,

179
00:14:58,051 --> 00:15:00,820
and you just walked
right the other way.

180
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,790
- You know, maybe you saw
my coat or my hair--
- Hey, I like your coat !

181
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,192
Maybe you, um--

182
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:12,029
Maybe you saw me
and I didn't--

183
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,999
Ashley, no.
That was me.

184
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:24,039
I thought you said
you, uh, had curly hair.

185
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,808
I do. It's ver curly.

186
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:30,477
When it gets long, it's really curly.
But I cut it short.

187
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:34,214
I can grow it out again, ifyou want.
I can get it pretty bushy.

to get to know me some otherway.

whatyou wrote to me,

he helped me with some
