1
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,167
Christina Walters?

2
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:32,448
God, I haven't heard that name in ages.

3
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,123
<i>The kind of woman</i>
<i>who can get any guy she wants, </i>

4
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,165
That's Christina Walters.

5
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:41,761
We dated briefly,
but she's not the commitment type.

6
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,280
She's a player. She just likes to have fun.

7
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:48,487
I met Christina at a bar. Hot piece of ass.

8
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,324
Totally hit it off. All night long we dance.
I buy her drinks.

9
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,601
At the end of the night, she just splits.

10
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,649
I lay down all that groundwork for nothing.

11
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,842
Lesbian.

12
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,203
She gave me her number. It's been three days.

13
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:08,644
I saw <i>Swingeer</i>. I know how these things work.

14
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,243
<i>Hello, and welcome to AOL Moviefone, </i>

15
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:15,602
I stay up nights trying to figure out
why she said she'd call and didn't.

16
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:20,286
Maybe she wanted to call and that's why
she said she was going to call, but...

17
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,241
"Christina"

18
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,482
"Christina"

19
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,800
You know, there ought to be
some kind of a signal...

20
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:36,759
...to let us guys know
when we are talking to a lesbian.

21
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:40,047
So we don't waste our time.

22
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:44,365
Prolonged impotence is very common
after a breakup.

23
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,280
Lots of men suffer from it.

24
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:50,885
They just don't talk about it.
Not like me, gabbing away. Gab, gab.

25
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,166
But, even still,
because she said she was going to call...

26
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:57,402
...she should've called
to say she wasn't going to call...

27
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,798
...and I would've thanked her for calling...

28
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:01,527
All right. <i>Okay </i>.

29
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:05,042
I apologize for saying she was a lesbian.

30
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,602
It's not true.

31
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,398
My male ego got bruised and I lashed out.
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,323
I'm not used to being blown off, that's all.

33
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,367
I'm sure she wasn't trying to hurt me on purpose.

34
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:23,844
I know deep down inside she's scared
and lonely just like everyone else.

35
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:28,161
She'll settle down though,
once she finds the right man.

36
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,798
<i>Or woman </i>.

37
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:32,888
Maybe has a little boxed lunch at the Y.

38
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:38,003
Jeez, I'm sorry. Did I say it again?
You're goddamn right I said it again.

39
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:41,240
Why don't you shave your head, Christina,
and take up women's golf?

40
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:45,368
Why don't you go to the Depot.
Lots of carpet you can munch on there.

41
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:55,237
At least I don't get that dizzy,
head-spinning nausea as much as I used to.

42
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,603
Hooray!

43
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:02,205
Like I said, I'm doing fine.

44
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,839
I am fan-fucking-tastic.

45
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,960
- Christina.
- Valerie!

46
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,847
Shake it if you've got it.

47
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,642
Miss Courtney.

48
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:41,960
Hello, Miss Christina.
How you doing? What you doing?

49
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:44,121
Dancing too much. How you doing?

50
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,848
Same thing. How was your day?

51
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:48,248
Pretty good.

52
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,878
I got a new account designing
a campaign for a sports line.

53
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:54,319
They got the right girl, didn't they?

54
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,288
Thank you.

55
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,003
So, what's up?

56
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:02,128
The usual. Defending the rights
of my broken-hearted clients.

57
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,043
Trying to squeeze every penny
out of their miserable, cheating spouses.

58
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,524
<i>You go get them, woman, </i>

59
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:11,169
I'll order a pizza and stay in tonight.

60
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:14,362
<i>Okay</i>, but if we do that,
you know what will have to happen.

61
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,328
Girl, I've been shaking my ass
all the way up this hill.

62
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:19,678
<i>Which track? </i>

63
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,566
Track three. Oh, yeah!

64
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,322
Koochie!

65
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:41,041
Is your granny here? What's going on?

66
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:43,597
It's Jane. She loves this song.

67
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:48,961
Jane, what's up?

68
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,721
He dumped me.

69
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:56,002
Kevin dumped me.

70
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:59,959
It was just three days
before our one-year anniversary.

71
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:03,286
- Baby.
- Maybe he just freaked out.

72
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,362
He will call up tomorrow when he realizes
what a huge mistake he made.

73
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,917
- He's probably going through that whole...
- No.

74
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,762
He says he's been wanting this for six months.

75
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:16,842
He says he's been dying inside
ever since I brought over my garment bag.

76
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,805
- Honey.
- What?

77
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:25,004
We're all guilty of it.
You made yourself too available.

78
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,484
It's a classic mistake, sweetheart.

79
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,163
- Yeah.
- Not according to this.

80
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,361
"Commandment four."

81
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,324
"<i>True Love: The Ten Commandments</i>."

82
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:39,442
"Commandment number four:
Thou shalt be open to love's possibilities.

83
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:41,844
"Boundaries are the enemies of love."

84
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:46,321
Sweetie, you know what?
This book is relationship propaganda.

85
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:47,888
Listen to me.

86
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,917
Dating is all about boundaries.

87
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:53,920
Honey, you have to protect yourself.

88
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,160
We've all had our heart stomped on
one too many times...

89
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:00,327
...because we served it to them
on a big old platter.

90
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,521
A good defence is the best offence.

91
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:05,600
I am so tired of playing games.

92
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:09,159
This is not about playing games.
This is about self-preservation.

93
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:13,163
You can't throw yourself out there
all exposed and vulnerable every time.

94
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,967
That is how you get smacked down.

95
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:16,562
Do you understand?

96
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:21,048
Don't go looking for Mr. Right.
Look for Mr. Right Now.

97
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:25,282
And, eventually, if he's worthy, then one day...

98
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:29,888
...that "now" part is just going to drop away.

99
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,522
Naturally, you know?

100
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,408
Meanwhile, you're just
going to have fun together.

101
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:38,004
Yeah. Not so serious. Shake it off a little bit.

102
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:41,126
Speaking of fun, we are going to take you out.

103
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,087
We are taking you out.
You are going to have a good time.

104
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:47,443
No.

105
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,122
Oswaldo!

106
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,361
Hey, Christina. Courtney.

107
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,604
- Jane.
- Hello, Jane.

108
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,682
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

109
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:03,924
Shut up!

110
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:14,164
Okay, girls, let's go.

111
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:20,607
This is it, Jane.

112
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:28,242
Go, baby!

113
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,206
- Right here, baby.
- Oh, my God.

114
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,200
They can have her.

115
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:25,204
Look at the shoulder, baby.
Bounce it, baby. Check it out, baby.

116
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,201
What's your name, baby?

117
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:31,967
Herewe go. Circle of love, circle of love!

118
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,526
We're going to go now.

119
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,726
Bye-bye.

120
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,721
My God. It's like Siegfried & Roy or something.

121
00:08:56,889 --> 00:08:58,720
Martinis, ladies.

122
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:02,839
- Compliments of the gentleman at the bar.
- Which one?

123
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:08,203
Thank you, Leather Coat Guy.

124
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:10,527
Cheers.

125
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,078
Leather Coat Guy is looking good.

126
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,608
Shotgun!

127
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:18,564
Cheater.

128
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:23,964
What's up?

129
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:28,203
Nothing. What's up with you?

130
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,603
Nothing.

131
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:33,402
What's up with you?

132
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:36,518
Nothing. What's up with you?

133
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:38,878
Nothing.

134
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:42,405
You know, I am having the best time.

135
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:43,683
Are you, sweetie?

136
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,398
My boyfriend dumped me. I'm at this club
where no one wants to talk to me.

137
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,798
- I want to go home.
- No.

138
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,405
No. Christina, I can't do this.

139
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,719
Yes, you can. It's really very easy.

140
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,728
Observe.

141
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,402
I just pinched his ass.

142
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:03,717
I'm sorry. Hi.

143
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,448
- Hi. What's your name?
- Peter.

144
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,680
Peter, this is my friend, Jane.
Jane would love to dance.

145
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:15,088
I don't mean to be rude,
but I have some friends waiting for me.

146
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,887
Nice to meet you, though.

147
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:21,525
- He hated me. I suck.
- You don't suck. That guy was a dick.

148
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:25,363
I'll make sure that you have fun tonight
if it's the last thing...

149
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,282
What did you call me?

150
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:33,759
You just called me a dick. I heard you.
Why am I a dick?

151
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,841
Because I didn't like the way
you treated my friend.

152
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:39,079
I didn't do anything to your friend.

153
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,639
You barely gave her the time of day.

154
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,206
You tried to pawn me off on her
and I didn't go for it.

155
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:49,562
You should be so lucky to even talk
to someone as hot and sweet as Jane.

156
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,638
Excuse me.

157
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:54,961
I wasn't suggesting you get married.
I just thought you could get it on.

158
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,000
What? Get it on?

159
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,126
You know nothing about me.
What if I'm some psycho serial killer?

160
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,281
What if Jane was the girl of your dreams,
but you'll never know?

161
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:05,007
That is the sweetest thing.

162
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:08,126
I never thought I'd meet her
by having somebody grab me and say:

163
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,441
"Man, I have good woman for you.
She is very hot and sweet.

164
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,884
"Jane! Dance for the man!"

165
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:17,005
- Maybe that's your problem.
- What?

166
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,167
Maybe if you didn't play it so safe,
Mr. Safety-Poo...

167
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,162
...you might meet a girl you could have fun with.

168
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:27,208
This brilliant love advice comes
from one who loves to play games with men.

169
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:30,645
Always in control.
That way, she never has to get too close.

170
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,086
Nice manners, by the way.

171
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:40,007
Where the hell did that guy... Jane?

172
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:42,282
What's up with you?

173
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,529
Nothing. What's up with you?

174
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,842
I can't believe he brought that bitch
to our bar.

175
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:54,638
- This is our bar.
- Forget her, she's a skeev.

176
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,846
- But is she prettier than me?
- Of course not, you're beautiful.

177
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,727
Oh, my God, you fucking bitch!

178
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,767
I can't believe you grabbed his ass.

179
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:06,364
He comes right into my face
and starts telling me all this stupid stuff...

180
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:10,727
...about how I like to play games
and be in control so I never get too close.

181
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,880
Can you believe him?

182
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,921
- What?
- Nothing.

183
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,599
- I've never seen you act like this before.
- Act like what?

184
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,003
They're fake.

185
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,523
All bah-jiggity about some guy.

186
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:24,248
- Bah-jiggity?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,439
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.

188
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:28,958
It's cool. It's why I got them.

189
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,483
- I'm not bah-jiggity.
- You are so bah-jiggity.

190
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,161
They look real.

191
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:35,240
Thank you. You can touch it if you want to.

192
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,318
No.

193
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:40,238
- Touch it. She likes it.
- Go ahead. It feels real, huh?

194
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,322
If I'm bah-jiggity about this guy Peter,
it's because you're telling me I am.

195
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:47,048
- Oh, my God.
- What?

196
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,722
You've named the puppy.

197
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,720
- I did not.
- You just called him Peter.

198
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,448
- I did?
- You've got to feel these things.

199
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,283
I'm psychic and I knew his name was Peter.

200
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:59,883
- Knock your socks off.
- So soft.

201
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,761
Un-fucking-believable.

202
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:03,278
Fuck.

203
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,040
I am so getting a pair.

204
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:09,041
That's why chicks
always go to the bathroom together.

205
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,008
It's so obvious that you like this guy.
Why are you being such a pussy about it?

206
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:15,319
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?

207
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:18,765
If you haven't noticed,
there's plenty of guys out there.

208
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:22,563
See you later.

209
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:27,079
- What's your problem?
- What's your problem?

210
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:32,724
- Hi.
- Hi.

211
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:35,918
Hey, Peter.

212
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,363
- Eric!
- Be right there.

213
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,844
You don't have to do this.

214
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,843
I know, but I want to. I spilled your drink.
Can I buy you another one?

215
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,158
Okay.

216
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,645
I want to apologize.

217
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:57,404
I shouldn't have been impolite to your friend.
If I was, I didn't mean to.

218
00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:02,005
My brother is waiting for me
and I got nervous, I guess. I don't know.

219
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,962
I mean, otherwise, I'd be all over your friend.

220
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:09,282
I'm the one who should apologize. I was rude.

221
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:13,721
No, I understand. You were protecting
your friend. Anyone would've done that.

222
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,481
I thought that was sweet.

223
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:21,368
Jesus.

224
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,242
- We good now?
- Yeah.

225
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,364
Good.

226
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,960
I should get back to my friends.

227
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:28,324
Okay.

228
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:30,962
Thanks for the drink.

229
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,364
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

230
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,886
- Have a good night.
- You, too.

231
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:48,043
Can you take this? I'm a total loser.
I just struck out with this guy.

232
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:49,323
One more thing.

233
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,727
Should I be upset that my ex-girlfriend
has her tongue down that guy's throat?

234
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,483
Oh, my God!

235
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,438
- Jane!
- I guess I blew my chance.

236
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:01,959
- That could have been you.
- If I wasn't such a dick.

237
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,518
- Was I really a dick?
- Yeah. You were a dick.

238
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:10,964
We should start over. Why don't I walk by,
and you grab me like before?

239
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,880
- I didn't grab you.
- You grabbed me.

240
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:14,925
You grabbed me right on the ass.

241
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:17,604
I don't grab, okay?

242
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:18,678
Pete!

243
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,244
Excuse me.

244
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,878
Dude! Where you been? Everybody's waiting.

245
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:28,803
After-hours party back at the hotel.
These two pigs are good to go.

246
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,285
Did I mention that we have
the Freddie Mercury Suite?

247
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,527
She puked on him!

248
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:39,648
Again? God, she's like a hose.
Go help her, please.

249
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:40,964
Or not.

250
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:44,208
She's out. We're one short. Who's this chick?

251
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,883
- She is hot. Bring her.
- What?

252
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:50,484
Fuck me. You have so much...

253
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,077
You've got to come. Let me tell you why.

254
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,044
You'll never find anyone better than my brother.
He is the greatest...

255
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:00,041
That hurts me. Just look at him.

256
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,769
Chicks freak on this guy. Come on, now.

257
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:06,120
He is the shit and that's why
he's in my wedding on Saturday.

258
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:07,483
- No.
- Yes.

259
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:09,998
- No.
- Just trying to help out.

260
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:12,238
'Bye!'

261
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,086
Ladies, big party. Four Seasons, room 402.
You're invited, you're invited.

262
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,807
All right, I'm leaving.

263
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:23,689
- That's my brother.
- He's special.

264
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:26,562
Careful, that's puke. Don't touch me.

265
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,406
When is the wedding?

266
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:32,567
Saturday afternoon up in Somerset.
That's where we live.

267
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:33,798
That's nice.

268
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:36,240
Peter! It's looking like now.

269
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,360
You're pinching my arm skin.

270
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:43,408
I better go. But for real this time.

271
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:46,879
- It was nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you. I had a great time.

272
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:47,958
Me, too.

273
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,119
Come by the party if you want to.

274
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,680
- Really?
- Definitely. If you want to.

275
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:55,124
I'll ask my friends. Maybe we'll stop by.

276
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:59,088
I really hope I see you. But in case
I don't see you, have a nice life.

277
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:01,558
You, too.

278
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:14,439
<i>Chris, it's Court</i>
<i>I'm at the party with Leather Coat Guy, </i>

279
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:17,521
<i>I was checking in to see</i>
<i>if you were listening to your messages, </i>

280
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,080
<i>If you are, tha tmeans you were</i>
<i>too chicken to hook up with Peter,,, </i>

281
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:26,720
<i>... which therefore means you are a loser, </i>
<i>You are a loser, A... </i>

282
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:28,482
Thanks, Court.

283
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,480
<i>"I'm a hig loser,"</i>

284
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:35,000
<i>What's up, you hitches and hos and loseer? </i>

285
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,241
Too late now.

286
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,725
He was kind of cute.

287
00:17:58,689 --> 00:17:59,917
Funny.

288
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:05,161
Really funny.

289
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:10,480
Cute boy.

290
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,485
My God, you're so good at that.

291
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:38,045
I'd like to do that every hour,
on the hour, for the rest of our lives.

292
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:40,245
- Of course, go ahead.
- Thank you.

293
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,679
Don't worry about returning the favour.
Men don't really like oral sex.

294
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:44,804
Right.

295
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:48,768
I'm serious. It's just a bad rumour
that was started sometime in the '50s.

296
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,921
I had no idea. I need to tell all my friends.

297
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:56,042
Please, do.
Someone needs to put an end to this madness.

298
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:04,604
God, I'm so glad I came back to the hotel room.

299
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:06,603
Me, too.

300
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:09,964
I never thought I'd see you again.

301
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:15,920
- Room service.
- Right on time.

302
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,807
- Ice cream?
- Only the best for our VIPs.

303
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,569
I had them remove all the calories for you.

304
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:25,840
You are good.

305
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,562
All right!

306
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,479
I said I wanted to do it to you every hour,
on the hour, but I can't wait.

307
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,127
Can I do it agaln now?

308
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:36,038
Okay.

309
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:23,725
San Francisco, California, please,
for Four Seasons Hotel. Thanks.

310
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,078
Great dream.

311
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:35,640
Yes, hi. Do you have a Freddie Mercury Suite?

312
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:40,079
Good. Can I have it? Thanks.

313
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,284
Really?

314
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:45,038
Already?

315
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,559
Have a great day. Thanks. Bye.

316
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:54,721
What am I even calling for?

317
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:02,878
Hello? Hey, Court.

318
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:04,558
Yeah.

319
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:24,203
- Stop talking shit about me.
- Where you been?

320
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:28,646
Sorry I'm late. I don't want to talk about it.
You ready? I'm starving.

321
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:33,482
I'll meet you there. I have to drop something off
at the dry cleaners.

322
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:36,527
Can it wait, please? I'm so hungry right now.

323
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:39,487
Isn't that Courtney's dress
that you borrowed last night?

324
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:40,638
Yeah.

325
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:44,278
Why are you bringing it in?
Did you get something on it?

326
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:48,127
I'm trying to be a good girlfriend.

327
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:52,563
- I'm really sorry.
- You slut!

328
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:54,321
- Is that what I think it is?
- Guilty!

329
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:57,207
I'll take it to the dry cleaners, and it will be gone.

330
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:00,008
- That's a lot!
- He was holding a lot!

331
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:03,246
My God! What's this on your skirt?

332
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:06,844
I am scared enough as it is to go in there.
What am I going to say?

333
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:10,365
"Mr. Martin, can you help me with my jizz?"

334
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:15,007
You know what?

335
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:19,043
- You guys suck.
- No, obviously you suck.

336
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,927
- You suck.
- You suck well. I'm proud.

337
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,365
No spanky-wanky.

338
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:52,438
Hey, Jane.

339
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:55,159
- Hi, Mr. Martin.
- How's your mother?

340
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:58,600
- Great. She's good. Everyone's good.
- Your grandmother?

341
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:02,522
- Everyone's great.
- That's fine. That's fine.

342
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:04,042
What you got for me today?

343
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,644
Just a dress, but I'll be back for it
in a few days, so no hurry.

344
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,124
- Any stains?
- No.

345
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,761
- What's this?
- What?

346
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:14,881
This. Come here.

347
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:17,164
Stain?

348
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:19,479
This is going to be a tough one.

349
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:26,406
I didn't even notice that. I must have spilled
some soda on me last night.

350
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:30,801
No. This is not soda. Think, Jane. Think.

351
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:34,957
If I know what it is, it's easier for me to remove.

352
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,439
The field trip. Come in, children. Come in.

353
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:45,358
- Fuck.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Franklin.

354
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:47,008
Hi, Mr. Martin.

355
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:52,839
On today's field trip,
we are going to learn about cleanliness.

356
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:56,803
Jane?

357
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:59,047
Jane Burns!

358
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:03,919
Sweetheart, I haven't seen you
since I taught you in third grade!

359
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,363
- Top of the morning there, Mr. Martin.
- Hello, Father Flynn.

360
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:18,121
As I live and breathe, isn't it...
It is little Mary Jane Burns!

361
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:22,319
What a coincidence!
I'm having supper with your parents tonight.

362
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:25,288
What a stain you got there, little Janie!

363
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:27,288
So how was it? Was it fun?

364
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:30,486
Oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't tell you this.

365
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:34,644
Apparently, one of the guys
who was at the party flipped out...

366
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:38,244
...was out on the balcony,
screaming at the top of his lungs:

367
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:43,644
"Christina! Has anyone seen
my little Christina?"

368
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:48,761
Then he jumps off and dies
because you're a pussy. Why didn't you go?

369
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:53,007
I don't know! I was going to. I was.
I was going to, and then I wasn't.

370
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:55,359
And then I called him at the hotel...

371
00:24:55,449 --> 00:24:59,124
Wait. Hold on. Rewind for one second.
You called him at the hotel?

372
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,763
- What did he say?
- Nothing. He said nothing. Okay?

373
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:06,607
- Why?
- He checked out already.

374
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:09,442
Let's just sum this up real quickly.

375
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,206
In the bathroom, we hate him,
yet we call him by name.

376
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,601
Then we throw beer on him.

377
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:19,166
Then we laugh and we flirt
and we dance with him.

378
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:23,921
Then we casually call him at the hotel.
Then we obsess about the casual call.

379
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:27,240
Obsess? I'm not obsessing, okay?

380
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:32,166
Could all this erratic behaviour
be because this guy got under your skin?

381
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:34,080
- No.
- That you might really like him?

382
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:37,957
That you regret not going because
you'll never know what might've happened?

383
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:40,802
No, I don't regret it, and if I had any regrets...

384
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:44,245
...it would be this conversation,
right now, having it with you.

385
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:47,162
- Can we drop it?
- Okay. Sorry I brought it up.

386
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:48,921
I won't mention it again.

387
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:55,283
Even if I did regret not going to the party...

388
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:58,762
...it's not like I can do anything about it now.

389
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:02,280
Sometimes you just have
to let these things go, right?

390
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,599
- Exactly.
- Although...

391
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:07,081
...if there was regret...

392
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:11,039
...I suppose there's always something
you could do about it.

393
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,520
You could show up at his brother's wedding,
because it is his brother.

394
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,442
But that's only if you regretted it,
which I don't regret it.

395
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:23,317
I just don't regret it.
Regret is such a waste of time.

396
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:26,806
Honey will you just admit
that you regret not going to this party.

397
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:30,165
- Okay, fine I regret not going to this party.
- You need to let it go.

398
00:26:30,249 --> 00:26:32,888
I'm letting it go. I'm over it.

399
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:36,041
Hi, honey, how did it go?

400
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,399
- Fine. No problem.
- Good.

401
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,601
Did we have fun last night?

402
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:44,483
Yes, I did. It was great.

403
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,129
You guys were right,
a transition guy is what I needed.

404
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:48,403
Good.

405
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:50,287
So how was he, was he good?

406
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:53,327
He was very sweet and complimentary.

407
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:55,727
And very into pleasing me first.

408
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:58,118
So how was girth?

409
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:00,362
Averag-ish.

410
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,919
"Averag-ish." That's good.
So what did you tell him?

411
00:27:04,609 --> 00:27:06,042
What do you mean?

412
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:08,929
What do we always tell them, no matter what?

413
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:17,607
Oh, my God, your penis is so big.

414
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,202
Good girl.

415
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:22,288
Your penis is so thick.

416
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:26,967
Your penis is just so pretty.

417
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:33,158
You got a handsome dick!

418
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,639
Your penis, it's so...

419
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,404
...hard.

420
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:43,038
Your penis is just so large.

421
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:46,360
My body is a movie...

422
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:50,682
...and your penis is the star!

423
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,761
You're too big to fit in here.

424
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,887
Too big to fit in here.

425
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:02,318
Too big to fit in here.

426
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:13,600
"You're too big to fit in here"

427
00:28:17,849 --> 00:28:18,964
Oh, my God.

428
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:22,121
Oh, my God, it's <i>Fame</i>! We're in <i>Fame</i> right now.

429
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:34,800
"What a lovely ride

430
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:36,766
"Your penis is a thrill

431
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,680
"Your penis is a Cadillac

432
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:40,361
A giant Coup de VIIle

433
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:44,278
"Your penis packs a wallop
Your penis brings a load

434
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:48,682
"And when it makes a delivery
It needs its own zip code

435
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:50,727
- "Nine"
- "Doublezero"

436
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:51,838
"Penis"

437
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:56,241
"You're too big to fit in here"

438
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:04,520
"Your penis is so strong
Your penis is so smooth"

439
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,919
- "Your penis has got a rhythm"
- "Your penis makes me groove"

440
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:12,207
- "Your penis is a dream"
- "The biggest one I've seen"

441
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,007
"It's oozy and it's green"

442
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:17,118
Sorry.

443
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:21,680
"You're too big to fit in here"

444
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:29,566

"Starring your penis"

00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:56,407
"You're too big to fit in here"

451
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:38,083
- Come on.
- How much time we got?

452
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,320
We've got three hours before the rehearsal.
Hit the ball.

453
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:44,565
- Good shot.
- Fore!

454
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:47,846
I'll shove that club up your ass, you dicklicker!

455
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:50,718
- What are you up by, two?
- I guess.

456
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,804
It doesn't get any better than this.

457
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:55,402
- To the marriage.
- To the marriage.

458
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:58,242
- To the bride.
- To the bride.

459
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:01,240
To 50 years with the same woman.

460
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:04,881
That's really depressing.

461
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:06,758
Sorry.

462
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:09,088
Saggy tits.

463
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,158
Be able to use them as a belt by then.

464
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:15,278
- Or just tuck them in her socks.
- Okay.

465
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:21,957
God, this marriage is such a big leap.
It's really intense, Pete.

466
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:25,360
- But if it's the right  woman...
- I guess.

467
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:29,919
Get up a little. Yes. Fore!

468
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:33,884
You motherfuckers! Stop bothering me!

469
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:35,925
You're driving right into them.

470
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:39,041
I hear John is still AWOL
from that bachelor party.

471
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:43,407
He showed up, missing an eyebrow,
with a tattoo on his ass that says "Bitch."

472
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:47,600
- I am not an animal!
- Very good.

473
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,247
Speaking of bitches...

474
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,840
...what was going on with you
at the club with that hottle?

475
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:56,567
- Nothing.
- I mean, Jesus!

476
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,924
I don't know what you're talking about.

477
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:01,239
- I think you liked her.
- No, I didn't.

478
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,684
Yeah, you did. Don't lie to me.

479
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:07,239
Don't lie. Don't lie to Darth, Luke.

480
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:14,837
I could see it in your eyes you liked her.

481
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,525
Nothing I can do about it now.

482
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:23,399
Should have poked her in the whiskers
when you had the chance.

483
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:25,168
What's that, Gramps?

484
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:28,158
I met this hot young dish...

485
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:31,844
...at the World's Fair back in 1940.

486
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:36,242
Every moment with her was like a slice of heaven.

487
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:38,719
I bet you really miss Grandma.

488
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,448
Fuck Grandma.

489
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:44,406
It's Pearl I'm talking about.

490
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:49,967
She was the love of my life.
Don't ever let these moments pass you by.

491
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:56,128
Fucking Grandma.

492
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:58,278
Be nice.

493
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:02,527
Come on. 7-6.

494
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:07,688
Fore!

495
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:27,880
You suck!

496
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:29,518
Damn it!

497
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:32,567
- But you smell so minty fresh now.
- What do you want?

498
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:35,638
I need to borrow your black Gucci bag.

499
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,528
It's in the living room.

500
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:42,238
I don't know where in the living room,
and I don't feel like looking for it.

501
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:45,446
Will you help me find it, please?
Come on, please.

502
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:48,566
Since I'm up now,
and you decided to torture me...

503
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:50,321
...I'll go and get it.

504
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,239
I'm sorry. Oh, my God. Excuse me.

505
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:57,604
Can you tell me where the bathroom is?

506
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,046
- Behind you.
- Over here?

507
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:06,683
Thanks.

508
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:08,283
Oh, my...

509
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:09,963
...cock.

510
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,687
Oh, my cock.

511
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:20,522
Do you have any Advil?

512
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,761
He is so cute. So stupid.

513
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:33,359
Can I get that purse now, please?

514
00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:35,645
Yes, you can have the purse.

515
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:37,927
Here's the purse.

516
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,965
Thank you very much.

517
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:46,881
- Where are you going?
- You and I are going to a wedding.

518
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:51,482
- What wedding? Who's getting married?
- We're going to Peter's brother's wedding.

519
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:52,604
Peter?

520
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:55,999
This Somerset place where they live
is some small freak-ass town...

521
00:34:56,089 --> 00:35:00,128
...three hours north, so we have to
get on the road now to make it on time.

522
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:01,961
- Peter.
- What?

523
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:05,400
I'm not going to Peter's brother's wedding!

524
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:10,199
What are you talking about? Yesterday,
you said you wanted to go, so I went...

525
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:13,729
- I was joking.
- No, you weren't.

526
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:16,038
Yes, I was.

527
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:20,325
Fifty percent of what people say
when they're joking is true.

528
00:35:20,489 --> 00:35:24,243
Which means you do want to go,
but you're too afraid to admit it.

529
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:28,123
So by making some sort of joke about it,
you get to say what you really want...

530
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,006
...without being vulnerable.

531
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:31,807
- Right?
- Maybe.

532
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:35,724
Okay. The wedding starts at 5:00.
I refuse to be late.

533
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:38,398
Put some clothes on. Now! Thank you.

534
00:35:39,769 --> 00:35:41,600
- That was a nice one.
- Thanks.

535
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,847
- Watch the road, sweetie!
- I am watching the road.

536
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,724
Once we get off the 140...

537
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:04,518
...we'll take the 95, get off on the Somerset exit.

538
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:08,040
We'll drive around
and we should find the church, no problem.

539
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:09,118
Ta-da!

540
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:16,079
- What is that?
- What is what?

541
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:19,679
- You don't smell that?
- What? I don't smell anything.

542
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:23,080
- You're used to it. That's what's scary.
- I don't smell anything.

543
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:26,479
It smells like mouldy ass,
is what it smells like in here.

544
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,846
Come to think of it,
I did leave some ass in the back.

545
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:31,885
- You did?
- About a week ago.

546
00:36:31,969 --> 00:36:35,723
It must be the ass. No, no. Sit down.

547
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:44,046
- What are you doing?
- Jesus, Courtney.

548
00:36:44,129 --> 00:36:46,723
What is all this crap?

549
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:49,802
Don't throw out anything I might need.

550
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:54,128
Where is it coming from? Where?
I can still smell it.

551
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,166
Maybe it's you.
Did something crawl up your poon-nonny?

552
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:03,880
I have never, ever had any complaints
in the poon-nonny odour department.

553
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:07,723
- You know what? Neither have I.
- High five on the clean poon-nonny.

554
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:09,278
Bitch.

555
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,364
What?

556
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:14,521
- What is this?
- What is what?

557
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:15,803
What is this?

558
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:18,801
Jesus, I don't know.
I don't know how long it's been in here.

559
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:20,447
What is in here?

560
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:28,486
No! That is not okay.

561
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:32,198
It isn't okay. You are a disgusting,
nasty pig. Do you understand?

562
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:34,519
There was maggots on that flesh.

563
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,998
I got maggot juice all over me.

564
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,288
Ladies' room.

565
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,288
Ladies' room.

566
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,445
- Someone's in here.
- Sorry.

567
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:54,958
- It might be a while.
- How long?

568
00:37:55,249 --> 00:37:56,841
Let me put it to you this way:

569
00:37:56,929 --> 00:38:00,205
I had lamb curry last night
and I'm shittlng out a Buick.

570
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,369
Was it absolutely vital
for her to tell us that?

571
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,199
Was it absolutely vital
for her to tell us that?

572
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,557
Hello?

573
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:12,963
Clear?

574
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:19,164
I feel like I have maggots all over me.

575
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:23,404
Don't move. You have a maggot right here.

576
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:26,283
Stop it.

577
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:29,044
I'm going to pee my pants.

578
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:31,281
I'll just use the urinal.

579
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:35,040
You want to hear some poetry?

580
00:38:35,169 --> 00:38:38,366
"There once was a man from Bandoo
Who fell asleep in a canoe"

581
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,202
"He dreamed of Venus
And played with his penis"

582
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:43,889
"And woke up with a handful of goo"

583
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,647
Don't make me laugh!

584
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:49,325
Darn it. I think I peed on myself.

585
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:53,278
"Follow the yellow brick road"?

586
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:58,721
I'm following the yellow brick road.
Follow the yellow brick road.

587
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:06,324
Buffy! You look like my old doggie Buffy.
Hello, girl.

588
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:12,082
- Oh, my God, it's on my hands!
- Good girl. What you got in here?

589
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:15,679
What you got? What's in your mouth?

590
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,367
What you got in there?

591
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:22,208
What's in there?

592
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:24,043
Surprise!

593
00:39:35,169 --> 00:39:36,284
Goddamn it.

594
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:39,725
How could you not know
what a glory hole is?

595
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:42,039
Unlike my whore friend
Courtney Rockliffe...

596
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,963
...I don't usually spend much time
in men's public bathrooms.

597
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:50,407
Goddamn. That is the funniest thing
I have ever seen in my entire life.

598
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:55,728
I flew across that room.
And you got fucked in the eye.

599
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:59,802
I'm glad you find it so fucking amusing.
I really do.

600
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:03,768
Could you please have some compassion?
Because I could go blind.

601
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:05,840
You're not going to go blind.

602
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:10,358
- Let me look at it.
- I mean, I got a penis in my eye.

603
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,647
Let me see. Let me see.

604
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:16,484
All right.

605
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:18,560
- Is it okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.

606
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:22,047
But I think you're pregnant.

607
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:25,087
Would you please stop it, already?

608
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:30,687
Re-dress the mannequins
and check the sock inventory.

609
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:33,920
Come on, it's Saturday and nobody's here,
and Mr. Mooney...

610
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:38,082
Mr. Mooney is off salling with his boytoy,
which leaves me in charge of the store.

611
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,080
Somebody needs to get some.

612
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:52,721
There's my dirty girl!

613
00:40:55,649 --> 00:40:57,640
It's me, baby. It's me.

614
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:03,601
- Why are you dressed like that?
- It's my job. I work at a children's hospital.

615
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:09,847
You look so cute.

616
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:13,764
- I'm horny.
- Me, too.

617
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:22,400
- You'll laugh at this one.
- What?

618
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:26,323
You know I sald I had to do laundry today,
because I ran out of clean underwear?

619
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:30,243
- I've only got the skanky ones left.
- Tell me about it, dude.

620
00:41:32,649 --> 00:41:34,640
You are so unbelievable.

621
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:40,566
Is that what I think it is?

622
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:44,927
- Spring break, 1994, baby.
- Turn it up.

623
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,560
- Oh, my God! Brain.
- Jane!

624
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,797
You and I are so awesome together.

625
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:24,880
We're like two peas in a pod.

626
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:27,119
- Like oil and vinegar...
- Shut up.

627
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:29,879
I can't believe I'm fucking
a purple elephant.

628
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:33,998
What do you mean, she's not here?
We have customers, missy.

629
00:42:34,449 --> 00:42:36,724
Sorry, Mr. Mooney. I'll check upstairs.

630
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:39,767
I'm gone for one day,
the place turns into Indonesia.

631
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:44,118
Jane?

632
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:50,838
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

633
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:52,681
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

634
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:57,441
I'm frantic. I've a million things to do.
And I'm dizzy. I'm so dizzy.

635
00:42:57,569 --> 00:43:00,925
Mr. Mooney is downstalrs,
and he is P-I-S-E-D.

636
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:03,038
"Pised"?

637
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:16,160
- Where have you been?
- I was upstalrs taking inventory.

638
00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:18,759
Yeah, my aunt Fanny.

639
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:22,484
- Gallini's.
<i>-Hello, is Jane there? </i>

640
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:25,728
- Yes, she is.
<i>-Have a lovely day, </i>

641
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:30,080
- Hello?
<i>-Janie! </i>

642
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,962
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'm really busy.

643
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:36,448
<i>We were wondering: </i>

644
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:43,958
Shit.

645
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:04,042
Oh, shit.

646
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:07,805
I dropped the thingy to my lip gloss.
Could you get it for me?

647
00:44:08,249 --> 00:44:09,364
I'll get it.

648
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,199
It's too far over. I'll get it.

649
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,083
Hold on to it. Keep steering.

650
00:44:17,169 --> 00:44:18,807
I got it. Don't worry.

651
00:44:20,729 --> 00:44:22,048
Beneath the...

652
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:34,757
Yeah, baby!

653
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:43,880
- Oh, yeah, right there.
- No, that's not it.

654
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:45,688
You like that?

655
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:51,043
Yeah. Let me have some of that.

656
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:53,802
- Oh, yeah. Don't stop.
- I'm not going to stop.

657
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:23,605
I found it.
I almost got smothered down there.

658
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:24,958
Shit.

659
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:26,243
Are you okay?

660
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:31,518
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good. Never better.

661
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:36,001
Let's get on the same page
about what we'll say. Game plan.

662
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:40,243
Walk up to him and be like,
"Peter, is that you?"

663
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:44,766
"My friend Courtney, that hot babe?"
She and I went to college with the bride.

664
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:48,762
"That is unbelievable.
I can't believe that. It's unbelievable.

665
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:49,918
"Freaky."

666
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:22,007
Afternoon.

667
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:31,288
- Miss Vera's has plenty to offer us.
- Plenty of crap.

668
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:34,042
- We don't have time for this.
- Okay, let's go.

669
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:39,525
- Welcome to my store. Can I help you?
- No, we were just browsing. Thank you.

670
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,880
You don't like my store, do you?

671
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:47,484
No, that's not it at all.
It's really a lovely store.

672
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:49,958
We were looking for something...

673
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:54,079
The next dress store is 20 miles from here.

674
00:46:54,169 --> 00:46:55,363
20 miles away?

675
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:59,762
- We'll miss the wedding.
- Judy Webb's wedding?

676
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,088
I know all about it.
I dressed half the guests!

677
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,925
When I was 22...

678
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:09,679
...my breastices were,
like, right about there.

679
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:11,928
Nice and perky.

680
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:14,808
Gravity has taken them to there.

681
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:17,917
It's like, 22, 28.

682
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:20,958
22, 28.

683
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:23,280
Buy some new ones.

684
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:28,248
O>kay, wait. No, no. Look. What is this?

685
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:35,078
- What is that, though?
- That, again, is gravity.

686
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:39,565
- Knock, knock. Are you decent?
- Yeah.

687
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,719
You're going to love this stuff.
It's our latest line.

688
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:46,807
If you need other sizes, just holler.

689
00:47:46,889 --> 00:47:48,447
Thank you, Vera.

690
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:51,397
Excellent.

691
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,522
Jesus.

692
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:56,404
- Look.
- That's nice.

693
00:47:56,529 --> 00:48:01,125
Wait a minute.
Do we have time for a movie montage?

694
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:03,202
Well, you know...

695
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,402
- Thank you so much.
- You look sensational.

696
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:08,520
Thanks to your styling, Vera.

697
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:09,598
Thank you.

698
00:49:09,689 --> 00:49:11,884
Would you like to be on our mailing list?

699
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:14,529
Sure. Right here?

700
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:21,884
Just send it there.

701
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:24,205
That's sweet.

702
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:28,200
It sure is. Thank you. Bye.

703
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:31,925
- We've got to go.
- Oh, my God. I can't walk in this thing.

704
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:34,280
- Take little steps.
- Bondage.

705
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,918
We don't have time, sweetie.

706
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,798
My God!

707
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:43,883
Oh, my God.

708
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:47,043
These are the days of our lives.

709
00:49:49,129 --> 00:49:52,280
- This is not discreet.
- No, it isn't.

710
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:56,248
- We can't walk into a wedding...
- Come on. It's very LaToya Jackson.

711
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:00,803
I mean, really. Look at all this...

712
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:04,359
I may as well strap a sign on my ass
that says "stalker."

713
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,842
I'm not going there wearing this outfit.
Can we please just go?

714
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:12,204
- Yes. Let's go home.
- Really?

715
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:17,524
We've driven for three and a half hours
and everything.

716
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:19,839
- But, no, let's go.
- Please.

717
00:50:20,009 --> 00:50:23,558
- Really. Let's go.
- Don't reverse psychology me right now.

718
00:50:23,649 --> 00:50:25,446
I'm not reverse psychologing you.

719
00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:28,885
You're so good at it,
you don't know you're doing it anymore.

720
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:31,327
All right, maybe a little bit.

721
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:35,527
- Court, this is crazy. Really crazy.
- What the hell were we thinking?

722
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:38,478
I wish there were some sign from God...

723
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,242
...that you and Peter Donahue
should be together.

724
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,321
How do you know his last name is Donahue?

725
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:46,565
Because you're sitting on his face.

726
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:52,602
- My God, it's him! He's so cute!
- Yeah, I know.

727
00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:54,487
Cute? He's adorable!

728
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:57,567
And look at this.
"Everything he touches turns to sold."

729
00:50:57,649 --> 00:51:01,119
- He's funny! He's funny, too. See?
- I know.

730
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:05,483
Church bells.

731
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:31,599
What do you think? Bride or groom's side?

732
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:33,839
I have to go to the bathroom, I think.

733
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:38,400
- Did you misplace your bladder today?
- I'm wearing the tightest skirt ever.

734
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:40,719
Go to the bathroom. I'll find seats.

735
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:44,839
- Could you tell me where the restroom is?
- It's right outside.

736
00:51:54,769 --> 00:51:55,997
Hello?

737
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:03,765
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I can't breathe.

738
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:07,637
Really? Okay.
Just breathe, stay calm, you'll be okay.

739
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:09,483
Are you okay?

740
00:52:10,409 --> 00:52:12,969
- You'll be fine. You'll be okay.
- Water!

741
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:16,478
Okay.

742
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:20,440
- Thank you.
- I'll leave you alone for a second, okay?

743
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:24,563
- Judy!
- In a minute, Dad.

744
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:33,923
I don't want to go in the deep end.
I don't want to go in the deep end!

745
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:37,444
Flowers!

746
00:52:40,009 --> 00:52:42,045
I look like a magazine bride!

747
00:52:42,129 --> 00:52:46,168
No, you don't. You look really beautiful.
Like the perfect bride.

748
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:48,205
Why don't I feel good?

749
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,764
I'm sure that you're just really nervous.
It's a big day, right?

750
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:55,239
It's what every girl dreams of, but...

751
00:52:56,489 --> 00:52:58,366
...how do you know it's real?

752
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:02,678
I don't know.
I can't answer that for you, really.

753
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:06,080
But I'm sure the two of you
will be really happy together.

754
00:53:07,329 --> 00:53:10,560
And if you're not,
you can always just get divorced.

755
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,203
- Yeah!
- Yeah, see? It'll be okay.

756
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:16,166
Right. You're so right.

757
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:19,759
So just get yourself together.
You look smashing.

758
00:53:19,889 --> 00:53:21,800
- I look beautiful!
- You look amazing!

759
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:24,847
- I look beautiful.
- You do. Amazing.

760
00:53:25,689 --> 00:53:27,759
- Now, get off my dress.
- I'm sorry.

761
00:53:29,129 --> 00:53:30,608
I'm getting married!

762
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:38,038
Hi.

763
00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:56,322
- I bet you miss Grandma.
- Grandma.

764
00:53:59,129 --> 00:54:00,323
Where is she?

765
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:17,008
Turn around.

766
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,965
It's Jesus. Look, it's Jesus.

767
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:34,718
Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice.

768
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:42,885
Okay, boys. We're on.

769
00:54:43,689 --> 00:54:46,522
- All right. Straight?
- Big moment.

770
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:48,645
- You look nice, too.
- Don't stress.

771
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:50,846
A little slap. Slap me.

772
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:56,600
Don't be gay in God's house.
Give me a hit. Thank you. Let's do it.

773
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:01,443
Shit.

774
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,958
Chris?

775
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:16,964
- I'm okay.
- My God! Honey, are you okay?

776
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:20,519
- What are you doing?
- I got locked in.

777
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:22,406
- You all right?
- Yeah.

778
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,081
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

779
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:29,798
We don't have to lie anymore
because I made friends with the bride.

780
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:37,966
No. You cannot lock the door.
Goddamn it!

781
00:55:38,049 --> 00:55:39,721
Hello!

782
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:46,043
Oh, please, God.

783
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:51,802
<i>Suki, suki! </i>

784
00:55:57,689 --> 00:55:59,361
It's already started.

785
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:08,647
I bet you miss Grandma.

786
00:56:09,729 --> 00:56:14,041
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

787
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:17,448
...to celebrate the holy matrimony...

788
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:19,920
...of Judith Katherine Webb...

789
00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:22,639
...and Peter Donahue.

790
00:56:22,929 --> 00:56:24,078
Peter?

791
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:27,925
Jesus Christ!

792
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:30,127
Peter? Shit!

793
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:33,404
She did it.

794
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:40,928
This isn't the Glickman bar mitzvah, is it?

795
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:45,525
- Moishe, are you here? No?
- Come on, Sharon, let's go.

796
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:46,804
Mazel tov.

797
00:56:46,889 --> 00:56:48,402
- Christina?
- The hottie.

798
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,604
Shalom!

799
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:57,437
That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.

800
00:56:57,569 --> 00:56:59,480
There are no Jews in Somerset.

801
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:03,525
Shit. Shit. Shit.

802
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:06,126
- Shall we proceed?
- Sure.

803
00:57:10,369 --> 00:57:12,564
Dearly beloved...

804
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:15,204
...we are gathered here today...

805
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:19,159
...to celebrate the holy matrimony...

806
00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:24,205
...of Judith Katherine Webb
and Peter Donahue.

807
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:30,445
Which is an honourable estate...

808
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:34,280
...instituted of God, signifying...

809
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,525
...unto us the mystical union...

810
00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:39,165
...that is between Christ...

811
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:41,488
...and...
- Peter.

812
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:42,957
...Saint...

813
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:50,687
- I'm having reservations.
- Where?

814
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:52,282
And is commanded...

815
00:57:52,409 --> 00:57:53,478
About this.

816
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:54,843
- Really?
- Yeah.

817
00:57:58,449 --> 00:57:59,768
...of Saint Paul...

818
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:01,487
- Me, too.
- Really?

819
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:02,924
Yep.

820
00:58:07,129 --> 00:58:10,678
And therefore,
is not by any to be entered...

821
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:14,364
- I mean, I love you.
- But I'm not in love bwith you.

822
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:15,844
...lightly.

823
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:17,078
Anymore!

824
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:19,641
- You're ruining it.
- But...

825
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,208
We're still friends.

826
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:27,000
- I don'twant to get married.
- I don'twant to get married.

827
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:31,318
No. No kiss. I haven't married you yet.

828
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:34,286
We're not getting married!

829
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:38,118
Miguel?

830
00:58:40,009 --> 00:58:41,078
Dad!

831
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:45,766
Butwe are having the party.
Exit in the back. It's to the left.

832
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:13,959
- How you doing?
- Okay. Are you okay?

833
00:59:14,049 --> 00:59:15,687
Yeah, no. I'm okay.

834
00:59:15,769 --> 00:59:18,727
- You ower me $30,000 for this wedding.
- Daddy, please.

835
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,003
- You know what I'm thinking of doing?
- What's that?

836
00:59:22,089 --> 00:59:26,685
I'll cash in the honeymoon tickets,
fly to Bali, and go scuba diving.

837
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:29,886
- I'll rip your face off, peckerhead.
- Daddy, stop.

838
00:59:30,849 --> 00:59:32,123
- Sweetie?
- Yes?

839
00:59:32,209 --> 00:59:35,963
- I have a confession to make.
- I have a confession to make. You're dead.

840
00:59:36,049 --> 00:59:39,246
Dad. I met someone.

841
00:59:39,529 --> 00:59:41,599
- You met someone.
- Online.

842
00:59:41,929 --> 00:59:42,918
Online.

843
00:59:46,569 --> 00:59:49,322
His name is Ricky.
I think he's really special.

844
00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:52,600
Fuck it! It's go time! Son of a bitch!

845
00:59:53,369 --> 00:59:54,688
Daddy, stop it!

846
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:12,519
Refresh my memory.
Was that Peter's wedding we walked in on?

847
01:00:15,129 --> 01:00:17,962
- Yeah.
- That's what I thought.

848
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:22,967
I'm such an idiot.

849
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:25,757
No, you're not.

850
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:28,797
I meet a guy for two minutes...

851
01:00:28,889 --> 01:00:33,201
...and I'm chasing after him
like he's something special.

852
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:38,327
Maybe you want someone special for once.

853
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:43,924
Maybe you were thinking
that you were tired of the game.

854
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:50,527
Are you tired of the game?

855
01:00:52,809 --> 01:00:53,844
Yep.

856
01:00:56,849 --> 01:00:58,043
Let's go home.

857
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:00,078
Okay.

858
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:19,005
My God! What's going on?

859
01:01:19,489 --> 01:01:20,922
Excuse me, Officer?

860
01:01:21,409 --> 01:01:22,922
What's going on here?

861
01:01:23,129 --> 01:01:26,883
Twenty years on the force
and I've never seen something so horrible.

862
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:29,958
- What? Where?
- Where's the emergency?

863
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:31,363
Apartment three.

864
01:01:32,049 --> 01:01:33,880
- That's my apartment!
- Jane.

865
01:01:36,489 --> 01:01:38,207
Poor girl. Never saw it coming.

866
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,081
Excuse me.

867
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:45,042
- Goddamn dress!
- Don't go in. It's not a pretty sight.

868
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:46,562
I live here!

869
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:58,680
- Apparently, they're stuck.
- What do you mean?

870
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:01,128
Are you okay?

871
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:04,800
How are you stuck?

872
01:02:05,049 --> 01:02:06,448
I have a piercing.

873
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:10,761
- I don't get it. How is she stuck?
- Behind her tonsils.

874
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:13,200
How the hell do you know that?

875
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:16,839
- Honey, I'm going to pull you gently.
- No.

876
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:19,768
I'm going to pull it. Gently.

877
01:02:21,889 --> 01:02:23,447
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

878
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:27,927
We've got the ambulance waiting outside.
We have to get going.

879
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:29,522
No, wait!

880
01:02:29,609 --> 01:02:33,238
She could sing. You could sing, Jane.
It relaxes the throat, honey.

881
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:43,923
Stop it! You're getting me hard again!

882
01:02:44,609 --> 01:02:46,088
Wrong song.

883
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:48,243
<i>Armageddon</i>.

884
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:06,523
Come on, try.

885
01:04:08,489 --> 01:04:09,524
What?

886
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:17,728
She says to him,
"<i>Girl You Know It's True</i> changed my life."

887
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:19,208
It did!

888
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,564
And this sad little tear slowly...

889
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:25,642
Come on. What do you want from me?
I was 16 years old.

890
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:29,604
I don't know why I started talking to her
in the sccond grade.

891
01:04:29,689 --> 01:04:32,761
- You thought I was the shit.
- You are the shit.

892
01:04:32,849 --> 01:04:34,248
Shithead.

893
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,718
- My God.
- What?

894
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:40,998
They found a donor for my patient.
I've got to go. I'm sorry, guys.

895
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:44,281
- Christina, it was great meeting you.
- Nice to meet you, Greg.

896
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:47,008
- Jane, it was great meeting you.
- Great meeting you.

897
01:04:47,089 --> 01:04:49,762
So sorry to run off.
I'll make you risotto tomorrow.

898
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:50,964
It's fine.

899
01:04:55,089 --> 01:04:58,286
- Can I just say, that was so sweet?
- He's great.

900
01:04:58,569 --> 01:05:00,560
- He's so sweet.
- Shut up.

901
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:02,998
He doesn't have any piercings, does he?

902
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:06,447
I don't know, actually...

903
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:11,199
...because I haven't
done that with him yet.

904
01:05:11,889 --> 01:05:15,165
- So, you know...
- Honey, you really do like him.

905
01:05:15,289 --> 01:05:18,201
I don'twant to talk about it,
because I'll jinx it.

906
01:06:14,529 --> 01:06:17,760
- I closed on the Mahalock house today.
- Great news for you.

907
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,726
You don't need to do a thing.

908
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:23,449
- What did they say about aluminium siding?
- No.

909
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:26,367
- Really?
- Really.

910
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:29,839
Be careful with those fat-free chips.
They cause anal leakage.

911
01:06:29,969 --> 01:06:33,120
- You cause anal leakage.
- Says so on the bag.

912
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:47,365
What kind of marketing brainiac
puts "anal leakage" on his product?

913
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:50,959
How can they even sell that crap?

914
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,244
- What time is your flight?
- 9:30.

915
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:57,323
I can't believe you're going to Costa Rica.

916
01:06:57,409 --> 01:06:59,843
Your female problems are over with.

917
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:02,201
- Hope so.
- They are.

918
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:04,849
You know what I hear
about Costa Rican women?

919
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:06,601
- For five pesos...
- No, Rog.

920
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,806
They take your chimichanga
and your <i>pequito</i>...

921
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:11,800
- No, <i>seor</i>.
- Listen to me!

922
01:07:11,889 --> 01:07:13,038
Fuck you.

923
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:17,122
All I'm saying is,
make nice with the concierge, okay?

924
01:07:19,249 --> 01:07:21,922
- You all right, Vera?
- Couldn't be better.

925
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,679
- Thank you so much.
- Where do you want it?

926
01:07:27,769 --> 01:07:30,522
Put her down right here.

927
01:07:30,689 --> 01:07:34,125
Since you're going away,
do you want to be on our malling list?

928
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:36,837
Yes, ma'am. I'd love to. Thank you.

929
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:41,805
I've been trying to get us off
that mailing list since 1982.

930
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:43,242
Relax.

931
01:07:43,649 --> 01:07:47,847
This is the hottest chick in this store
and I caught her trying to escape.

932
01:08:09,249 --> 01:08:10,967
Very strange.

933
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:20,239
Sweetie, Christina, what's going on?
What happened?

934
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:25,600
I came to just eat my cookie
and make a phone call, but...

935
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,886
You didn't want to eat the cookies? What?

936
01:08:29,249 --> 01:08:31,888
- Just read this.
- All right.

937
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:36,485
"Commandment number nine:
Thou shalt love what's possible."

938
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:40,558
Honey, we have gone over this.

939
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:43,721
You did not know
the guy was getting married.

940
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:46,165
It's all right. He wasn't possible.

941
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:49,844
Not that one. The next one.
Commandment ten.

942
01:08:50,129 --> 01:08:54,042
- "Thou shalt not fear"?
- Yes. "Thou shalt not fear."

943
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:56,160
What are you talking about, fear?

944
01:08:56,249 --> 01:08:58,888
What you did was an incredibly brave thing.

945
01:08:59,249 --> 01:09:03,288
You dropped all of your boundaries
and you met this guy halfway.

946
01:09:03,489 --> 01:09:05,957
More than halfway, you went to Somerset.

947
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:09,406
Guys, it was just another game. Come on.

948
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:13,882
If he hadn't been getting married,
wasn't the groom, what would I've done?

949
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:16,838
That's right.

950
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:22,761
I would've done the same old thing.
I would have hesitated. I would have...

951
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:28,919
...froze up.
I would have kissed him and then ran off.

952
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:32,843
Give him the wrong phone number.

953
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:37,284
Hook that fish
and just throw him right back.

954
01:09:38,329 --> 01:09:39,398
Jesus.

955
01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:45,081
I'm stuck in a rut.

956
01:09:49,649 --> 01:09:52,641
Big, fat rut.

957
01:09:54,009 --> 01:09:57,126
Guys, I don'twant to be that girl anymore.

958
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:00,321
- I know.
- You know?

959
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:02,559
I know. None of us do.

960
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:07,961
Let's go dancing.

961
01:10:12,329 --> 01:10:13,762
So, any chance?

962
01:10:14,129 --> 01:10:17,599
Of what? No, don't even bother.
She's on a mission.

963
01:10:28,889 --> 01:10:31,483
- How is it shaking, ladies?
- No, thank you.

964
01:10:31,809 --> 01:10:34,403
Your body is banging. Your face is...

965
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:36,366
Neato. Thanks. Neat.

966
01:10:42,129 --> 01:10:44,120
What's going on, hot mama?

967
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:51,084
Bringing it down. Bringing it up now!

968
01:10:54,529 --> 01:10:57,646
Here it comes, baby. Feel the monkey.
Work the monkey.

969
01:10:57,729 --> 01:11:00,527
The monkey, the monkey, the monkey!

970
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:08,806
- You'reworking that monkey.
- You're a really good dancer.

971
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:12,802
- You have some original moves.
- Thanks, I've been working on it.

972
01:11:13,489 --> 01:11:16,083
- Have we met before?
- A couple of times.

973
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:17,484
I'm Donny.

974
01:11:22,649 --> 01:11:23,684
Christina.

975
01:11:23,849 --> 01:11:25,919
This is like <i>Sixteen Candles</i>.

976
01:11:28,009 --> 01:11:30,045
I'd love to take you out sometime.

977
01:11:30,129 --> 01:11:33,439
Really? Well, that's nice. I mean...

978
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:36,877
Give me your card, I'll call you sometime.

979
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:39,726
Thank you.

980
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:42,205
You seem like a really nice person.

981
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:45,800
- Work on the monkey.
- I'll work on the monkey.

982
01:12:13,049 --> 01:12:14,402
Hey, Donny.

983
01:12:15,209 --> 01:12:17,279
- Do you have a pen?
- You bet.

984
01:12:21,929 --> 01:12:25,968
I'm a jerk and I wanted to apologize,
because I didn't plan on calling you.

985
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:29,326
I'll give you my number
so that you can call me...

986
01:12:29,409 --> 01:12:34,642
...because I found out something
that was completey life-changing:

987
01:12:34,889 --> 01:12:37,323
It's okay to take a chance.

988
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:41,283
Love is crazy and that's what love is,
it's taking a chance.

989
01:12:42,169 --> 01:12:46,560
My girlfriend Courtney and I
went on this crazy ride for a guy.

990
01:12:46,649 --> 01:12:51,086
I went across the state, practically,
to find this guy that I don't even know.

991
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:55,168
I don't even know you, but here I am,
having this conversation with you.

992
01:12:55,249 --> 01:12:59,561
And I know that if I just take a chance
with you, maybe, I don't know...

993
01:12:59,729 --> 01:13:01,321
Forget it.

994
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:04,681
What's a guy got to do to get laid?

995
01:13:42,249 --> 01:13:43,967
- Chris?
- Yeah?

996
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:45,198
Honey?

997
01:13:47,809 --> 01:13:48,878
What?

998
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:53,763
My God.

999
01:13:56,889 --> 01:13:58,447
What am I going to do?

1000
01:13:59,009 --> 01:14:01,603
I think you can handle this one
on your own.

1001
01:14:02,129 --> 01:14:03,801
It's all good, girl.

1002
01:14:05,889 --> 01:14:08,801
Figure this one out. Figure it out. Okay.

1003
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:15,724
Christina?

1004
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:19,167
What are you doing here?

1005
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:22,720
- I came here to apologize to you.
- For what?

1006
01:14:22,809 --> 01:14:25,801
For not telling you I was getting married.

1007
01:14:25,889 --> 01:14:28,642
I should have told you that and I didn't.
I'm sorry.

1008
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:31,562
You're the guy that needs the last fling
before your wedding.

1009
01:14:31,649 --> 01:14:33,924
No. I'm not that guy.

1010
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:39,244
You spilled my drink and I let you buy me
a beer. Tha twas all there was to it.

1011
01:14:41,369 --> 01:14:43,644
We had fun, we talked and that was it.

1012
01:14:44,889 --> 01:14:45,924
Right?

1013
01:14:47,809 --> 01:14:49,561
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1014
01:14:50,809 --> 01:14:52,322
I didn't get married.

1015
01:14:57,929 --> 01:15:01,080
- What do you mean?
- Judy and I, we called it off.

1016
01:15:04,889 --> 01:15:08,802
I hope my... That thing that happened
didn't have anything to do with it.

1017
01:15:08,889 --> 01:15:11,323
No, it had nothing to do with that.

1018
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:16,119
We realiezd we were doing the wrong thing.
Two people should be in love.

1019
01:15:17,209 --> 01:15:20,326
But Judy is happy.
She's scuba diving in Bali.

1020
01:15:20,409 --> 01:15:24,118
She really liked you, too.
Why were you at my wedding?

1021
01:15:25,969 --> 01:15:30,963
It was just one of those spontaneous things
my girlfriend and I do.

1022
01:15:31,209 --> 01:15:33,359
It was just, really...

1023
01:15:34,649 --> 01:15:36,446
It just got screwed up.

1024
01:15:41,129 --> 01:15:43,962
I came here tonight
because I wanted to see you.

1025
01:15:44,489 --> 01:15:46,923
I thought that maybe...

1026
01:15:48,449 --> 01:15:50,679
Well, that night that we met...

1027
01:15:51,449 --> 01:15:55,601
...I thought there was something,
some feeling I had about us.

1028
01:15:56,729 --> 01:16:01,245
I thought that maybe you might
feel that way, too.

1029
01:16:01,329 --> 01:16:04,560
Is this a mutual thing?
This is not a mutual thing at all.

1030
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:06,964
This is a very stupid thing. I'm stupid.

1031
01:16:07,049 --> 01:16:10,086
I should go.
I really apologize for wasting your time.

1032
01:16:10,169 --> 01:16:13,206
And I'll go jump off
the Golden Gate Bridge now.

1033
01:16:13,329 --> 01:16:17,038
Thanks. See you.
I'm stupid. That's right.

1034
01:16:17,569 --> 01:16:20,925
That's exactly what I wanted to do.

1035
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,479
Yes. Gosh, it's going so well.

1036
01:16:46,809 --> 01:16:48,561
I'm not going to be afraid.

1037
01:16:55,089 --> 01:16:56,124
Peter?

1038
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:02,168
Shit. Peter, wait!

1039
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:14,928
Shit.

1040
01:17:31,649 --> 01:17:32,638
Come on!

1041
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:36,201
Are you okay?

1042
01:17:36,849 --> 01:17:37,884
Yes.

1043
01:17:40,209 --> 01:17:42,086
I don't think I handled that too...

1044
01:17:42,169 --> 01:17:45,764
I didn't handle it at all. I'm so sorry.

1045
01:17:46,409 --> 01:17:49,207
I wanted to find you
so that I could tell you...

1046
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:53,723
...that I did come to your wedding
because I wanted to see you again...

1047
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:57,404
...because the feeling is mutual,
and you better be a good kisser.

1048
01:18:11,169 --> 01:18:12,443
That was weak.

1049
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:14,677
- Weak?
- Yeah.

1050
01:18:17,009 --> 01:18:18,920
It's okay. You can try again.

1051
01:18:30,129 --> 01:18:32,279
You were so much better in my dream.

1052
01:18:33,049 --> 01:18:34,164
Hold these.

1053
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:41,367
- I thought this was mutual.
- Oh, my God.

1054
01:18:41,489 --> 01:18:44,322
I'm serious. I'll call you, okay?

1055
01:18:45,409 --> 01:18:47,240
What? Wait!

1056
01:18:47,329 --> 01:18:49,638
Thanks for the flowers. Nice touch.

1057
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:52,118
I'm out of practice! I just woke up!

1058
01:18:53,369 --> 01:18:54,563
Unbelievable!

1059
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:04,248
Christina Walters. Yep. I know her.

1060
01:19:04,329 --> 01:19:07,162
Bitch. Made my life a living hell.

1061
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:11,761
She tries to pawn me off on her friend.
She calls me a dick.

1062
01:19:11,849 --> 01:19:14,238
She hunts me down like a dog
at my own wedding.

1063
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:17,048
Then, when I try to apologize, she's like:

1064
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:21,208
"I don't know you. You're one of hundreds.
I have no feelings for you..."

1065
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:29,127
Is that how I sound?

1066
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:38,319
The movie is starting. Let's go!

1067
01:20:05,169 --> 01:20:06,318
Fuck Grandma.

1068
01:20:16,809 --> 01:20:18,686
Save yourself a buck.

1069
01:20:23,249 --> 01:20:24,967
- A girl that you lick.
- Really?

1070
01:20:25,049 --> 01:20:27,005
- That you lick.
- A girl that I lick?

1071
01:20:34,489 --> 01:20:36,207
Are you all right?

1072
01:20:36,769 --> 01:20:38,600
You'rewatching the credits?

1073
01:20:56,169 --> 01:20:58,922
- Chicks freak on this guy.
- You ower me thirty...

1074
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:09,404
Copy that.

1075
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:17,767
Is that what you want?

1076
01:21:22,849 --> 01:21:26,159
I think there's always time
for a movie montage.

1077
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:38,448
I hope you like how sexy I am.

1078
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:49,279
Okay. I'm not going to be afraid.

1079
01:21:52,369 --> 01:21:53,688
I'm not.

1080
01:21:56,929 --> 01:22:00,285
It's a very bad rumour.
It's a rumour. I'm serious.

1081
01:22:00,489 --> 01:22:01,604
Crap.

1082
01:22:08,689 --> 01:22:11,362
You really got my ass. It's good.

1083
01:22:15,009 --> 01:22:16,078
Cut!

1084
01:22:23,889 --> 01:22:26,005
- I look beautiful.
- You look amazing.

1085
01:22:26,089 --> 01:22:28,842
- I look beautiful. Thank you.
- You do. Amazing.

1086
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:37,565
We can sit here like this all night.

1087
01:22:37,769 --> 01:22:40,681
- I bet you miss Grandma.
- Grandma.

1088
01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:51,083
- I'm not bah-jiggity.
- You are so bah-jiggity.

1089
01:23:04,049 --> 01:23:05,960
It's Jesus. Look, it's Jesus.

1090
01:23:10,009 --> 01:23:12,443
I guess a blowjob is out of the question?

1091
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:14,681
That is the sweetest thing.

1092
01:23:14,769 --> 01:23:15,963
Bye!

1093
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:24,167
Well, that was fun.

1094
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:50,441
- It's over. Bye-bye, go home.
- You can leave.
