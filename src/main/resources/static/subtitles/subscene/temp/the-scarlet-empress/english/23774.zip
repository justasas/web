{2703}{2750}How often do i have to tell you...
{2753}{2817}that Sophia Frederica is no longer to play with toys.
{2821}{2903}She's almost seven now.|Don't smoke in here. The child is sick.
{2906}{3018}l work day and night to arrange an advantageous |marriage someday and you undo everything.
{3022}{3114}How am i to make it clear to you that|Sophia might one day become a queen?
{3117}{3189}l don't want to be a queen, mother.|l want to be a toe dancer.
{3193}{3276}Be quiet, Sophia. You're going to marry a king |if i have anything to do with it.
{3280}{3341}Stick out your tongue, your Highness|and say ''ahh.''
{3345}{3450}Ahh.
{3454}{3530}Not as bad as l thought.|We'll build her a nice harness,...
{3534}{3586}and she'll have to wear it for about a year.
{3590}{3670}Put those toys away.|l don't want to see them again!
{3674}{3742}You'll grow up to be a tall and beautiful woman.
{3746}{3810}l must be off on one of my operations.
{3813}{3883}Don't let them frighten you, darling.
{4026}{4100}''A nice harness!''|What is he, a horse doctor?
{4103}{4221}You flatter him. Our learned medico is going to |perform one of his operations with an axe.
{4224}{4282}-He's the public hangman.|-Hangman?
{4285}{4363}What's a hangman?|Can l become a hangman someday?
{4366}{4450}A hangman is an executioner,|the man who takes heads off skillfully.
{4453}{4535}Sometimes that profession|becomes the sport of titles.
{4538}{4583}l was about to read to you...
{4586}{4649}of Peter the Great|and Ivan the Terrible,
{4653}{4750}and other Russian tsars|and tsarinas who were hangmen.
{7472}{7527}Stop walking, August.|You make me nervous.
{7671}{7751}Your Highness, letter from the king.
{7755}{7823}Your father wishes to see you at once.
{8382}{8427}Sit down, my child.
{8430}{8499}We have been honored with|a communication from His Majesty...
{8502}{8553}which concerns you principally.
{8737}{8818}''We, by Divine Grace Frederick King of Prussia,
{8822}{8896}''have, after a series of negotiations,
{8899}{9002}''decided to honor your family|by selecting your daughter,
{9006}{9098}''Sophia Frederica to forthwith set out for Russia...
{9101}{9217}''and there to become the bride of|His Serene Highness, Peter Feodorovich,
{9220}{9302}''grandson of Peter the Great,|nephew of Her Imperial Majesty,
{9305}{9370}''and heir presumptive to the throne.
{9374}{9430}''Within the week, an emissary will arrive...
{9434}{9518}''to escort your daughter and her mother,
{9522}{9612}''Princess Johanna Elizabeth, to the court at Moscow.
{9615}{9681}'' Please inform her that she is to follow dutifully...
{9684}{9745}''the advice of Her Majesty's ambassador...
{9749}{9837}''and extend to her, as well as to your entire family,
{9840}{9939}my fond greetings and affections.|Fredericus Rex.''
{9942}{10014}Grand duchess of Russia!|Not bad for this family.
{10018}{10054}l wonder what he looks like.
{10058}{10139}That unimportant detail can be settled|when the ambassador gets here.
{10142}{10187}Come, August, |we shall reply to the king at once.
{10190}{10245}One must strike while the iron's hot.|Come with me.
{11279}{11402}This is the countess Cecilia,|a cousin on my mother's side.
{11405}{11510}and this is her sister, Maria,|and this...
{11655}{11709}Your Highness may now come down.
{12450}{12537}This is Count Alexei,|field marshal of the Russian Army,...
{12540}{12585}...grand master of the hunt,
{12588}{12659}...lord of the chamber|and ambassador extraordinary...
{12662}{12739}...from Her Divine Majesty,|Elizabeth of Russia.
{12742}{12807}This is my daughter Sophia.
{12936}{13036}Although for a long time we've heard|about your beauty, Your Highness,
{13040}{13134}l must confess, l was not quite prepared|to see such a vision of loveliness.
{13137}{13235}Her Majesty instructed me to present a few gifts|as evidence of her graciousness.
{13239}{13297}Come here.
{13300}{13360}This pipe is for you,|Prince August.
{13391}{13466}These sables are to keep|your shoulders warm.
{13469}{13569}These gloves are to keep your hands warm.
{13572}{13644}This robe is to keep your feet warm.
{13674}{13735}These hot-water bottles,
{13739}{13794}to keep Mother warm.
{13797}{13885}Is it then still so cold in Russia, Your Excellency?
{13888}{13933}lndeed, Your Highness,|the rivers are still frozen,
{13936}{13999}and will be until some time after we've arrived.
{14113}{14180}Her Majesty also asked me to give you|this token of her esteem.
{14183}{14247}Convey to her my profoundest thanks.
{14251}{14327}lsn't Her Majesty beautiful!|How long will the journey take?
{14331}{14390}lf weather permits,|we should reach Moscow in seven weeks,
{14393}{14440}where Her Majesty is impatiently awaiting us.
{14443}{14537}-And when does Your Excellency require the journey be begun?|-The day after tomorrow,
{14540}{14591}unless it is the desire of this charming young lady...
{14594}{14654}to leave at once to meet her anxious bridegroom.
{14657}{14721}-Did you bring me a portrait of the grand duke?|-l'm sorry, l did not.
{14724}{14778}-Would you like him to be handsome?|-lsn't he?
{14781}{14857}Would you like him to be better looking|than all men, tall and gracious?
{14860}{14962}-Yes, l think l would.|-Well, he is all that and more.
{14965}{15077}He's the handsomest man in the Russian court, |tall and formed like a Greek god,...
{15081}{15167}...a model in fashion and deportment|which all of us strive to follow.
{15170}{15218}-Are you eager to see him?|-Yes.
{15221}{15266}His eyes are like the blue sky,
{15269}{15319}His hair the color of ebony.
{15322}{15377}He is stronger than a team of oxen,...
{15381}{15474}...and sleepless because of his desire|to receive you in his arms.
{15478}{15538}And he can also read and write.
{15542}{15624}So can my daughter. She can cook and|sew and make her own bed if she has to.
{15628}{15724}-Can't you, Sophia?|-But l don't like to make my own bed, Mother.
{15728}{15842}-Don't speak unless you're questioned.|-You did question me, Mother.
{15846}{15930}Say good night and go back to your room |and go to sleep.
{17010}{17109}This is unexpected.|Your daughter is extremely charming...
{17113}{17175}and will be by far the most beautiful|woman at Her Majesty's court.
{17178}{17250}l'd be grateful if you were not to turn her head.
{17253}{17309}She's been brought up carefully, is unspoilt,
{17312}{17390}and l've taught her not to flirt.
{18506}{18614}You're going on a far journey,|and l may never see you again.
{18618}{18666}Remember what l've taught you.
{18670}{18750}Always to be honest and truthful;
{18754}{18870}to be a faithful wife and a loyal|subject of your new country.
{18872}{18932}Be kind to those who are in your service...
{18936}{19018}...and obedient to your husband and superiors,...
{19021}{19140}...and strive at all times|to be worthy of your glorious destiny.
{21056}{21104}Another day like this and l'll fall apart.
{21107}{21174}When l return, l'll complain to the king|about the state of his roads.
{21178}{21223}The roads are bad, aren't they?
{21227}{21304}When we reach the border, |there will be snow and we shall change to sleds.
{21307}{21377}Your rooms are ready, Your Royal Highness. |Can l show them to you?
{21380}{21452}Yes, you may.|l'm prepared for the worst.
{21793}{21865}ls the journey proving too much for you too?
{21868}{21920}Oh, no. lt could go on forever...
{21923}{21983}if Mother didn't mind.
{22490}{22574}Be careful with that knife.|You'll cut your beautiful hand.
{22578}{22656}Your hand is beautiful, isn't it?
{22762}{22848}-Why did you do that?|-Because l've fallen in love with you.
{22852}{22917}Now you may punish me for my effrontery.
{22975}{23029}l deserve punishment far more than you do.
{23033}{23132}We must never do this again.|lt's disloyal to my future husband.
{23136}{23211}Disloyal? lt's treason and |l must be careful in the future,...
{23214}{23293}...but you must help me by not exciting me|with your beautiful eyes.
{23296}{23363}l told you not to look at me.
{23473}{23553}What are you two doing?|Don't answer me. l don't want to know.
{23557}{23614}Sophia, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
{23617}{23681}You will instantly follow me to our rooms.
{23800}{23883}lncidentally, our rooms are beneath|all contempt, Your Excellency.
{23887}{23991}The stables are probably better|than the quarters assigned to us.
{23994}{24050}l'm sorry, Your Highness.|lf you prefer the stables,
{24053}{24108}l'm certain I can arrange |to have the horses quartered in your bedroom.
{24112}{24162}Barbarian!
{24165}{24239}You're going to sleep in my room tonight.
{25975}{26080}lt is cold. At least you have something|to warm you when you get to Moscow;
{26083}{26169}That is, if your husband isn't completely made of ice.
{26223}{26275}A basket of fruit with Her Majesty's compliments,...
{26279}{26331}...and these flowers from the grand duke,...
{26335}{26446}...who instructed me to ride day and night|for a week to be here in time.
{30540}{30598}Welcome home, Your Excellency.
{30601}{30664}We've missed you.
{30772}{30850}So, this is Little Sophie, Sophia Frederica.
{30853}{30923}Hardly a name for a future empress.
{30927}{31012}-You don't like your name, do you?|-l do, Your Majesty.
{31015}{31098}You will be called Catherine Alexina,|a good Russian name.
{31102}{31178}We've arranged a special ceremony|to receive you into our church.
{31180}{31255}-Haven't we, Simeon?|-Yes, little mother, we've arranged a ceremony.
{31258}{31316}Come here.
{31372}{31439}So, this is the mother.|You've raised a pretty child.
{31443}{31529}Your Majesty, l've come to lay at your feet |feelings of the deepest gratitude...
{31532}{31604}for the benefactions which your bounty|has heaped upon my house,
{31608}{31700}and of which many instances are given me|at every step I take into your realms.
{31704}{31755}Tush, tush! A pretty speech.
{31759}{31834}What I have done is nothing|in comparison with what I shall do.
{31837}{31915}-My own blood is no more dear to me than yours.|-ls that the grand duke?
{32064}{32137}This is the order of St. Catherine.|May you both wear it in good health.
{32140}{32220}Be careful it doesn't scratch you.|Pin this on Catherine.
{32223}{32269}What do you think of Catherine?
{32272}{32327}l can only admire your judgment, Your Majesty.
{32331}{32459}That's the chancellor. Steals more money in a week than|l collect in taxes in a year.
{32462}{32547}Doctor, come here.
{32551}{32627}What do you think of my taste in women?|Looks healthy, doesn't she?
{32631}{32696}Just what we need to breed sons for Russia.
{32699}{32762}With your permission, Your Highness.
{32853}{32940}-How was the journey? Comfortable?|-Yes, Your Majesty.
{32943}{33017}Are you happy to be here?
{33020}{33068}Yes, Your Majesty.
{33071}{33176}-Are you going to love your new country?|-Yes, Your Majesty.
{33179}{33268}-Do you promise to be a loyal subject?|-Yes, Your Majesty.
{33271}{33366}Don't make too many new friends and no intrigue and gossip.|l have my hands full now.
{33418}{33498}Perfect, Your Majesty.|She will give us no trouble.
{33501}{33566}Your Highness.
{33605}{33664}Someday l'll have every doctor|thrown out of the country.
{33667}{33748}Catherine, before you go to your rooms,|is there any wish l can grant you?
{33751}{33837}l would like to see the grand duke.
{33938}{34008}His lmperial Highness, Grand Duke Peter.
{34801}{34895}That's a fine way to receive your bride! |l suppose you had more important things to do.
{34898}{34988}I told you to be on time.|Go on, kiss each other.
{35042}{35175}Remember, Catherine,|the first child must be a boy.
{35178}{35263}That's why we had you brought here,|to provide Russia with an heir to the throne.
{35266}{35391}A fine, bouncing, healthy heir.|You understand me, Catherine?
{36136}{36193}These are your ladies-in-waiting.
{36197}{36264}They represent illustrious houses|of our most important domains.
{36268}{36312}Step forward, Natacha.
{36316}{36392}She is the daughter of Prince Dolgorukij.
{36395}{36467}Natacha, come here.
{36471}{36577}This is your mistress of the wardrobe.|She has charge of the beds and laces.
{36742}{36823}l must show her my new invention.
{37427}{37499}l'm in a hurry.|l must witness an execution.
{38016}{38099}I suggest that you wait in the next room.
{38472}{38570}Perhaps l shouldn't have lied to you.
{38573}{38619}Forgive me, won't you?
{39020}{39091}His lmperial Highness sent me for his soldiers.
{39094}{39169}l hope l haven't disturbed you.
{39279}{39397}That's Countess Varonsoff. |She's always picking up the grand duke's soldiers...
{39400}{39482}...which l'm beginning to suspect he leaves intentionally.
{41044}{41114}Don't bother. Don't bother.|Go on with your work.
{41161}{41264}Doesn't Sophia, l mean Catherine, look beautiful?|l always forget the new name.
{41267}{41328}Just see what's being done to her hair!
{41332}{41391}That's exactly what l'm looking at.
{41394}{41470}How's she going to wear the headdress?|Where is the headdress?
{41473}{41526}-Where is the headdress?|-Where's the headdress?
{41726}{41803}We must make you very beautiful,|Catherine, very, very beautiful...
{41806}{41866}So that my nephew will fall in love with you.
{41869}{41955}l expect you two to behave like love birds |so Russia will have an heir to the throne.
{41958}{42097}Remember, l want a boy, not a girl.|Nothing less than a boy will do.
{42100}{42159}We don't want any more women on the throne.
{42162}{42264}But Your Majesty, what would we|have done if you had been born a boy?
{42268}{42363}l would have had less trouble in Russia|if l'd been born a man instead of woman.
{42366}{42437}We women are too much creatures|of the heart, aren't we, Catherine?
{42440}{42497}Yes, Your Majesty.
{50709}{50791}''Grant them of the fruit|of their bodies fair children,
{50794}{50843}''concord of soul and body.
{50847}{50907}''exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon.
{50911}{51011}''like a luxuriant vine, give them seed|in number like full ears of grain...
{51015}{51107}''that they may abound in every work that|is good and acceptable unto Thee;
{51111}{51205}''and let them behold their children's children like|a newly planted olive orchard,
{51208}{51287}''round about their table that|obtaining favor in Thy sight,
{51290}{51351}they may shine like the stars of heaven.''
{51354}{51407}Blessed be this bed.
{54524}{54594}Your lmperial Majesty,
{54597}{54701}before the bridal pair retire,|l wish to propose a toast...
{54704}{54791}to Her lmperial Highness,|the grand duchess Catherine.
{54794}{54876}May our new bride from far away|be forever happy...
{54879}{54966}and learn to know the love we have|in our Russian hearts for her...
{54969}{55051}and the hope this vast,|imperishable empire has...
{55054}{55122}for an heir to the throne.
{55495}{55572}You have made me|very happy today, Catherine,
{55575}{55672}and i hope you will continue|to make me happy.
{55725}{55775}Now, l'm going to bed.|l'm very tired.
{55779}{55849}And l know that most of you...
{55852}{55906}are...
{55986}{56050}...are also very tired.
{59933}{60049}May l inquire how Her lmperial Highness|deigns to feel this morning?
{60053}{60145}Her Highness feels as well as can be expected...
{60148}{60213}after her romantic marriage.
{60217}{60260}And how is His Excellency?
{60263}{60357}His Excellency is distressed because |you've been avoiding him for an eternity.
{60465}{60518}-l haven't been avoiding you.|-You have.
{60521}{60586}l've tried again and again to see you alone...
{60589}{60666}-And you've made it impossible.|-If you must know,
{60669}{60748}l haven't had enough time|to recover from the shock...
{60752}{60866}of finding my husband a trifle different|than you described him.
{60869}{60936}l had a duty to my country|and a loyalty to my sovereign.
{60940}{61019}Had l described the grand duke correctly,
{61022}{61066}you might not have come here.
{61069}{61167}l would have obeyed my mother|even if you had told the truth.
{61170}{61258}How could l have known of such|a degree of filial respect?
{61261}{61332}Anyway, l would have taken no chances,|because from the moment l saw you,
{61336}{61392}-l wanted you to come to Russia.|-Please, be careful.
{61395}{61491}-My husband will be told.|-Your husband doesn't mean|a thing to you.
{61495}{61539}He does. l'll always|be faithful to him.
{61543}{61607}Those ideas are old-fashioned.|This is the eighteenth century.
{61611}{61684}But l'm not a Russian.|l'm going now.
{61736}{61803}l told you l wanted to see you alone.|l won't wait any longer.
{61807}{61863}l'll be at the stables tomorrow|when you go for your ride.
{61866}{61912}Maybe l won't care to ride anymore.
{61916}{61987}-l'll be there,|and you'd better be there too.|-l will not!
{61991}{62063}Furthermore, l'm going|to tell my mother all about you.
{62115}{62218}One moment more,|Your Imperial Highness.
{62221}{62341}On the reverse side of this miniature|is a diamond. Don't lose the diamond.
{63188}{63250}What are you doing here|sneaking around like a ghost?
{63254}{63340}-l hate my wife.|-You hate your wife?
{63343}{63406}You've only been married|for a week. Why?
{63484}{63550}You'll make a fine emperor|someday, you idiot!
{63553}{63623}You can't force a woman to be sweet|to you. She's only a child!
{63626}{63703}Be patient with her.|You know our people are waiting|for you to raise a family.
{63706}{63778}-They don't care whether you like her.|-l don't want her.
{63782}{63857}l picked her for your wife, and your|wife she will remain as long as l live.
{63861}{63936}Get that into your skull.|I don't want to hear any more about it.
{63939}{64004}Do you understand me?
{64394}{64449}Her Majesty is waiting for you|in the council chamber.
{64452}{64497}-War with Finland?|-Yes, Your Excellency.
{64500}{64558}-How is Her Majesty?|-The last few days she's turned sour,
{64562}{64621}like milk that's been|standing too long.
{64885}{64960}Your Highness is|so happy this morning.
{64963}{65039}-You can't be going to see your husband.|-Dear me, my husband!
{65042}{65131}l'd forgotten l have a husband.|No, l'm not going to see my husband.
{65181}{65268}lf Your Highness were not so new|to our court, l'd suspect you|were going to see your lover.
{65272}{65376}Lover?|And what may a lover be?
{65379}{65462}A lover's a man, not a husband,|who loves you with all his heart|and whom you love in return.
{65465}{65585}But, Marie, that's wicked.|Don't tell me that you have a lover!
{65589}{65652}I wish I had. Here, everyone|has a lover, everyone but me.
{65655}{65762}Oh, Marie, not everyone. Her Exalted|Majesty can't possibly have a lover.
{65765}{65819}What about the young man|who's always with her?
{65822}{65900}Why do you suppose|she leans on him so heavily?|Because she's weak in the knees?
{65903}{65987}Oh, how shocking! lf anyone|should hear us! Go on, get my dress.
{65990}{66092}Your highness won't tell anyone.|The empress is a devil when she's angry.
{66095}{66179}Of course l won't tell anyone,|nor do l believe such nonsense.
{66183}{66272}Neither have l a lover. l'm happy|because l'm going to see my mother.
{66275}{66340}-Your mother? l thought you knew.|-Knew what?
{66344}{66416}Your mother left for Germany.|Her carriage set out at midnight.
{66420}{66469}-You must be joking.|-l'm not joking.
{66472}{66533}Her Majesty ordered her|to return immediately.
{66536}{66644}But she didn't say good-bye.|That's not possible.
{67044}{67105}Her Majesty's in council.|No one's allowed to enter.
{67108}{67202}No order in this palace|is intended for me.
{67632}{67723}Why did you send my mother away?|What wrong had she done?
{67727}{67782}l don't remember sending for you.
{67785}{67843}I want to know why|you sent my mother away.
{67847}{67909}You presume to question me?|Who do you think you are,
{67912}{68022}bursting into a conference as|though the palace were on fire?
{68026}{68095}You want to know why|l sent your mother away.
{68098}{68143}Well, l'll tell you why.
{68146}{68212}l sent your mother away because|she didn't bring you up properly.
{68215}{68290}l was told you were an obedient,|respectful child.
{68293}{68339}You're nothing of the sort!
{68343}{68422}Why do you think l had you brought from|Germany? To give you these pearls?
{68425}{68496}Or to make you a grand duchess|of the Holy Russian Empire?
{68499}{68555}l had you brought here|to be an obedient wife...
{68559}{68662}and to supply my country with|a much-needed heir to the throne.
{68770}{68832}Take Her lmperial Highness,|the grand duchess,
{68836}{68881}and turn her over|to my mistress of the robes...
{68884}{68970}with instructions|that from this minute on she's|to be attached to my personal staff...
{68974}{69060}where l can keep her under my eye,|where l can educate her and teach her...
{69063}{69129}what it means to be|a Russian wife and how to accept|the embraces of a husband...
{69132}{69177}like a Russian wife!
{69180}{69268}Now, get out, both of you.|I have a war on my hands.
{70123}{70180}Looking for someone?
{70183}{70243}Oh, you frightened me.
{70247}{70306}l've only a minute. l ran away.
{70310}{70426}l came down to tell you|not to wait. l must go now.
{70429}{70518}ls that all you came to tell me?
{70698}{70770}What else is there to tell?
{71590}{71672}lf you come closer,|l'll scream.
{71675}{71772}lt will be easier for you to scream|without a straw in your mouth.
{72974}{73019}Get up! Get up!
{73022}{73071}Why are there six places?|What's the occasion?
{73075}{73177}You asked me to arrange a dinner|for the French and Austrian ambassadors|and their wives.
{73180}{73255}Tell them to come for breakfast.|l never did like these|diplomatic functions.
{73259}{73342}-They lead to nothing.|-l quite agree, Your Majesty.
{73581}{73679}Don't any of you think|l'm going to eat with a lot|of dried-up mummies every night.
{73682}{73740}Boris, sit down there.
{73744}{73799}Alexander, sit over there.
{73803}{73847}You, sit there.
{73851}{73895}Michael!
{73924}{73978}-Your Majesty.|-Catherine.
{73981}{74026}Take his toys.
{74029}{74091}Michael, sit there.|Paul!
{74124}{74198}-Your Majesty.|-Oh, go on. Sit down.
{74201}{74279}Now, the rest of you get out.|Get out! Get out!
{74489}{74571}-The pig, Your Majesty.|-Put it down and don't make|so much fuss about it.
{74574}{74631}The way you handle that pig, you'd think|it was the only one in Russia.
{74634}{74706}-The wine, Your Majesty.|-Fill the glasses and get out.
{74710}{74795}What are you pouting for?|You're not jealous of Paul, are you?
{74799}{74882}He isn't jealous of you. You look|exhausted, Paul. What's the matter?
{74886}{74958}l'm tired. My wife gave birth|to a child yesterday.
{74962}{75070}-Boy or girl?|-A boy, beloved empress.
{75074}{75160}What the wife of a guard can do should|certainly be easy for a grand duchess.
{75163}{75265}Remind me to give you a purse of gold|tomorrow. Those of you who have boys,
{75268}{75349}raise your hands.|Exactly what I thought!
{75352}{75474}A few more like you, and Russia|need never worry about her enemies.
{75478}{75570}What's this, Alexei?|Sending notes to the grand duchess?
{75573}{75622}Do you want me|to send you into exile?
{75626}{75716}Or shall l tell the grand duchess|that you're a notorious heartbreaker...
{75719}{75790}and have broken every woman's heart|in this court, including mine?
{75793}{75889}You're very flattering,|lmperial Majesty, but the note|contains nothing of importance.
{75892}{75937}Then suppose you read it.
{75986}{76054}''We are all very much disturbed|over your conduct...
{76057}{76171}and wish you would change your behavior|so that Her Majesty might forgive you.''
{76174}{76251}Who else can read here?
{76254}{76316}You read it, Catherine.|l know you can read...
{76319}{76436}because my reports say you foolishly|spend your time in bed reading books!
{76591}{76684}''We are all very much upset at,|uh, uh --
{76687}{76821}''at--and hope...|you will behave better...
{76825}{76897}so that you may be|forgiven by the empress.''
{76901}{76959}Send for the chancellor!
{77336}{77396}-Your lmperial Majesty?|-Read this for me.
{77426}{77476}''You must help me|to see you alone again.
{77480}{77543}''You are being watched so closely|that all my efforts to meet you...
{77546}{77621}for a few precious seconds|are in vain.''
{77625}{77693}So, you're up to|your old tricks again!
{77696}{77750}Right under my nose too.|Well, forget about her.
{77753}{77826}she's reserved for my nephew and being|taught how to earn his love first...
{77829}{77874}before wasting her favors on others.
{77877}{77946}Go back to your dinner. lt's the first|time you've been of use to me in a year.
{77949}{78030}As for you, look after my friends|and see that they're fed well.
{78033}{78104}Did you hear what l said?
{78246}{78333}Sit down,you fools,|or I'll send you to Siberia.
{78337}{78399}She may be a grand duchess|to the rest of the world,
{78402}{78487}but in here she's being taught|how to be a Russian wife!
{79200}{79287}Catherine, where are you?|Take off my boots!
{79330}{79392}Go outside and send the others away.|Everybody!
{79396}{79463}l want to be alone tonight.
{79584}{79658}Her Majesty wishes|to be alone tonight.
{79805}{79900}You wouldn't think that once|l had skin like velvet.
{79903}{80002}Empress, bah! l haven't even the power|to iron out a single wrinkle.
{80005}{80083}What are you looking at?
{80455}{80514}That must be Peter.
{80517}{80602}Go see if it is, and tell him|to come here at once.
{80874}{80985}Your lmperial Highness,|Her Majesty wishes to see you at once.
{81274}{81362}What the devil do you mean|poking holes in my bedroom?
{81419}{81475}l wanted to watch my wife.
{81478}{81530}Watching your wife won't give you|an heir to the throne.
{81533}{81612}The next time l catch you providing|my rooms with needless ventilation,
{81615}{81660}l'll have you flogged.
{81663}{81780}l'll catch my death of a draft|someday! Go back to your rooms|and wait for your wife.
{81895}{82003}This is your fault.|l had hoped by bringing you to Russia|to make a man of that half-wit!
{82111}{82180}Sorry to intrude, Your Majesty.
{82183}{82267}l think the grand duke dropped|one of his soldiers in here.
{82271}{82315}Thank you.|Good night.
{82319}{82379}Wait a minute.|Come here.
{82530}{82606}How long have you been at this court|picking up soldiers?
{82610}{82654}Two years and a half,|Your Majesty.
{82658}{82734}l fail to recall your exact duties here,|Countess Elizabeth.
{82737}{82830}l'm in charge of entertainment for|His lmperial Highness, the grand duke.
{82833}{82881}Exactly how far is it|to your home, Lizzie?
{82885}{82947}My ancestral home is in|the province of Astrakhan,
{82950}{83018}about two weeks'journey from Moscow.
{83021}{83114}Not as far as l had hoped.|His lmperial Highness has been|entertained long enough.
{83118}{83181}Do you understand me? l don't want|to see you around again. Get out.
{83370}{83416}She won't snoop|around here anymore.
{83419}{83496}l should have thrown her out|before l had you brought here.
{83907}{83958}Come here, Catherine.|Sit down.
{83961}{84009}Haven't you given me|trouble enough?
{84013}{84063}Are you going to behave|like an obedient wife...
{84066}{84133}or must I continue to treat you|like a stubborn child?
{84137}{84188}l don't care|what you do with me.
{84192}{84249}You might change|your mind about that.
{84253}{84343}You're in love with His Excellency,|Count Alexei, aren't you?
{84346}{84405}No, Your Majesty, l'm not.
{84409}{84456}l'm not.
{84460}{84505}lt's a good thing you're not.
{84509}{84565}l wouldn't advise you|to become my rival.
{84597}{84696}Rival? What does|Your Majesty mean?
{84700}{84787}You will find out soon. ln the|meantime, you can blow out the candles.
{85020}{85075}Before you retire...
{85078}{85144}you can be of one more service.
{85227}{85328}Behind my mirror, a concealed passage|will lead you down...
{85332}{85415}a flight of stairs|to another door.
{85419}{85491}behind that door you will find|someone waiting to come up.
{85495}{85595}I don't want him|to see you, so be careful.
{85863}{85930}-Good night, Your Majesty.|-Good night, Catherine.
{85933}{86043}And you don't need to report|for duty until late tomorrow.
{90462}{90523}Halt!|Who goes there?
{90526}{90595}-Nobody.|-Just a minute, my little hen.
{90598}{90676}That's not the password.|You'd better think up another one.
{90772}{90860}Come to the guardhouse,|and we'll find out who you are.
{90864}{90908}You're entirely too good-looking|to be running around like this.
{90960}{91013}What are you hiding back there?
{91016}{91073}Take your hands off me,|you insolent fool!
{91076}{91124}l'm Catherine,|grand duchess of Russia.
{91128}{91197}Don't take advantage of me.|This is my first night on duty.
{91200}{91272}The grand duchess isn't permitted|out at night. Tell me who you are.
{91276}{91328}l told you who l am.
{91332}{91376}Oh, come now.|Stop joking.
{91380}{91439}lf you're the grand duchess,|then l'm the grand duke.
{91442}{91489}l wish you were!
{91492}{91549}if i were the grand duke and|you were the grand duchess,
{91552}{91621}l wouldn't let you prowl|through the night like this,
{91624}{91681}like a pretty little kitten.
{91840}{91945}Suppose l didn't want to tell you|who l really am. What would happen?
{91948}{92021}On a night like this,|anything might happen...
{92024}{92093}if l'm fortunate.
{92096}{92182}Well, Lieutenant,|you are fortunate,
{92186}{92253}very... fortunate.
{93192}{93241}lt's ringing!
{93245}{93330}Three volleys.|lt's a boy!
{94535}{94579}Have you noticed, Your Majesty,
{94583}{94651}how the imperial duckling|resembles his father?
{94706}{94750}Hush, hush, enough of this.
{94794}{94839}Now,you keep an eye on him.
{94842}{94913}l don't want anyone near him unless|l know about it, not even his mother.
{94916}{94973}l had enough trouble getting him.
{94976}{95081}lf he catches cold|or sniffles just once,
{95084}{95129}l'll have you|hung by the ears!
{95132}{95177}lf he coughs,|l'll have you cut in half!
{95180}{95250}And if anyone touches him,|l'll have you shot!
{95253}{95305}Your Majesty, l beg of you|not to become excited.
{95308}{95373}You've been ill for weeks.|This turmoil will weaken you.
{95376}{95445}Don't any of you think l'll give you|the pleasure of seeing me die!
{95448}{95541}l'll outlive all of you,|you sinister buzzards. All of you!
{95544}{95613}-We've been glad with rejoicing.|-Your lmperial Highness!
{95616}{95669}l suppose you, too,|want to congratulate me...
{95672}{95753}as the father of the heir|to the throne of Russia.
{95756}{95825}That was my intention,|Your lmperial Highness.
{95828}{95909}And l bring you|the felicitations of my nation...
{95912}{96020}and my own personal congratulations|on so glorious an event.
{96024}{96065}Yes, l know.|Tell me about it some other time.
{96068}{96116}l want to be alone, do you hear?|Get out, all of you!
{96120}{96177}l'm crammed up to my neck|with congratulations!
{96180}{96277}Get out! And if you must congratulate|someone, congratulate my wife!
{96676}{96728}May l speak with Her Highness?
{96732}{96777}Shh.
{97340}{97435}The empress joins her people|in congratulating Your Highness...
{97439}{97512}on the birth of a male heir|to the throne of Russia.
{97516}{97560}We all hope you will|recover quickly...
{97564}{97608}so you may wear this jewel,
{97612}{97680}which Her Majesty is pleased|to present to you as a sign...
{97684}{97772}of her most extraordinary joy|and satisfaction.
{99089}{99170}Sit down, ladies.|Sit down.
{99173}{99242}Your Excellency,|what can l do for you?
{99245}{99290}Will you please ask|Her Highness once more...
{99293}{99346}-if she will grant me an audience?|-l'm sorry, Your Excellency,
{99349}{99441}we have orders from Her Highness|not even to mention your name to her.
{99444}{99514}Then perhaps you will|convey to Her Highness...
{99517}{99586}that l've been waiting|for some time now to congratulate her...
{99589}{99706}on the great historic event|of providing our country with|a much-needed heir to the throne.
{99709}{99786}l'm certain that history was far from|her mind at the time, Your Excellency.
{100385}{100466}Her Majesty is very ill,|and her days are numbered.
{100469}{100526}Soon she will be no more,|poor soul,
{100529}{100610}and another maniac|will become our emperor.
{100685}{100802}lt will be a bad day for Russia,|and for me if l live that long.
{100805}{100852}Why are you telling this to me?
{100855}{100965}You know that the grand duke|isn't exactly pleased with|the present state of affairs.
{100968}{101013}State of affairs?
{101016}{101104}What affairs? l haven't|had an affair for some time.
{101107}{101201}l know that the grand duke plans|to remove you from court...
{101204}{101262}or worse,|as soon as he is in power.
{101265}{101332}You need have no fear for me.
{101335}{101410}Now that l've learned how|Russia expects me to behave,
{101414}{101460}l like it here.
{101463}{101516}And l intend to stay...
{101519}{101565}grand duke or no grand duke!
{101568}{101613}We all hope you will stay,
{101616}{101679}and l for one, at the risk|of my neck, would like to help you.
{101682}{101745}How could you be of help?
{101749}{101820}l control enough|of the political machine|to carry some weight in a crisis.
{101823}{101904}l have no wish to share|in any petty conspiracy.
{101907}{101988}Should it become unavoidable,|l think l have weapons...
{101991}{102078}that are far more powerful|than any political machine.
{102082}{102188}l'm afraid you don't|know Russians, my child.
{102228}{102332}That's possible, father,|But i'm taking lessons as fast as l can.
{104303}{104379}Right here, gentlemen.
{104420}{104477}What a lovely target.
{104516}{104623}You're looking quite well,|Catherine,
{104627}{104761}since you provided me with|an unexpected addition to the family.
{104764}{104849}Thank you, Peter.|lt's nice to see you again.
{104996}{105086}Come to think of it,|l'd like you to meet someone...
{105089}{105161}who's come for an extended visit.
{105212}{105269}What are you doing here?|Back to the barracks!
{105272}{105329}Get out!
{105332}{105377}Come along, Catherine.
{106069}{106138}What do you think|of this decapitation?
{106140}{106186}lt would be more amusing|if it were real.
{106188}{106234}Where's your visitor?
{106357}{106403}Oh, it's Lizzie.
{106406}{106520}ls she in charge of your entertainment|again? What will Her Majesty say?
{106619}{106684}Her Majesty doesn't|know anything about it,
{106687}{106732}and l wouldn't advise|you to tell her.
{106735}{106792}l wouldn't dream|of telling the empress.
{106795}{106852}She has her own|system of spies.
{106855}{106924}Not for the world would l interfere|with your pleasures,
{106927}{107008}as long as you don't|interfere with mine.
{107045}{107116}How is Astrakhan, Lizzie?|Or was it Afghanistan?
{107119}{107182}lf you're wise, you'll find out|for yourself before it's too late!
{107186}{107270}There are comfortable convents|along the way. All you have|to do to gain admission...
{107274}{107343}is shave your head.|It's good for the scalp, anyway!
{107346}{107402}Entirely too many men|love my hair,
{107406}{107502}and l have no intention|of changing my residence.
{107562}{107658}-Anyway, this country will|soon need a new empress.|-You may as well know...
{107662}{107729}Peter's going to marry me|when the old bat dies...
{107732}{107798}and as soon as he gets rid|of his present wife!
{112273}{112406}There you are, you old crow.|Dead as a doornail at last.
{112409}{112454}What have you|got to say about it?
{112457}{112502}Open your mouth if you can.
{112505}{112562}ln another week,|it'll be full of ice.
{112565}{112629}ln another month,|not a soul will mourn for you.
{112632}{112734}ln another year, you'll be forgotten.|Where is all your power?
{112737}{112806}lt's mine now!|Do you hear me?
{112809}{112918}Take it away from me if you can!|lt's my turn now!
{116628}{116680}-Who is this officer?|-Orloff, Your Majesty,
{116684}{116728}Captain in charge|of the barracks.
{116732}{116804}Your Majesty, your visit here|is the greatest honor in my life.
{116808}{116912}l've heard a good deal|about you, Captain,
{116916}{116976}from the ladies.
{117987}{118076}l didn't expect to see you here,|Your Excellency.
{118079}{118138}Why not, Your Majesty?|This is my pet regiment.
{118141}{118194}You look ravishing.
{118301}{118354}Now, there's another|good-looking soldier.
{118357}{118405}Come here, Lieutenant.|What's your name?
{118408}{118465}Dmitri, Your Majesty.
{118468}{118566}And your duties, Dmitri?
{118569}{118631}In charge of the night watch,|Your Majesty.
{118634}{118728}lt must be cold at night...|sometimes.
{118731}{118776}Sometimes, Your Majesty.
{118780}{118854}Anyway, l'm certain you're|very efficient, Lieutenant.
{118857}{118927}ls he, Captain?|Tell me something about him.
{118930}{118975}He's very effiicient,|Your Majesty.
{118978}{119026}He joined our regiment|from the Swedish front,
{119030}{119075}where he fought bravely|for about two years.
{119078}{119141}He's also distinguished himself by|exemplary bravery on the Turkish border.
{119144}{119198}This should have been|brought to our attention.
{119202}{119283}l can't understand why such a brave man|hasn't been decorated.
{119286}{119338}His Excellency doesn't mind.
{119342}{119438}Not if Her Majesty will tell me|why she continues to avoid me.
{119442}{119562}Her Majesty will tell you tonight...|if you will call on her.
{119566}{119626}With pleasure, Your Majesty.
{119686}{119754}For bravery in action.
{119758}{119850}See that you do justice|to it in future emergencies.
{119854}{119922}And now, Captain,|tell me something about yourself.
{119926}{120022}Your Majesty, l'm distressed|at my neglect at not having|rewarded Lt. Dmitri before.
{120026}{120094}With your permission,|Your Majesty.
{120390}{120450}Rich too, huh?
{121278}{121358}Her Majesty will see you now,|Your Excellency.
{121605}{121650}At last, Your Majesty,|l've achieved...
{121653}{121726}the enviable privilege|of entering these rooms.
{121729}{121818}l seem to have a faint recollection|that you had that privilege before.
{121821}{121866}Not since the days|of Her Late Majesty,
{121869}{121954}whom l often visited|in the capacity of a trusted advisor.
{121957}{122010}Tell the others l've retired.
{122013}{122127}Send them away,|and come back in here.
{122426}{122495}Her Majesty wishes|to be alone tonight.
{122498}{122543}You may retire.
{123114}{123231}Tell me, Alexei,|are you still fond of me?
{123234}{123295}Yes, Your Majesty,|l love you.
{123298}{123363}But l'm completely bewildered|by your attitude towards me.
{123366}{123423}However, l've become accustomed|to regard you...
{123426}{123467}as one of those|extraordinary women...
{123470}{123519}who create their|own laws and logic.
{123522}{123591}and now I'm concerned|only with your safety.
{123722}{123779}ls it my safety|that concerns you...
{123782}{123859}or the safety of an empress?
{124027}{124143}l would give my life if|the woman l adore were not so|far removed from me in station.
{124147}{124248}The woman you adore is quite|close to you, isn't she?
{124251}{124327}Catherine,|l love you, worship you.
{124799}{124859}l asked you here tonight because|l want you to do something for me.
{124863}{124955}l can trust you, can't l?|We'll always be friends, won't we?
{124959}{125027}Yes, Your Majesty.|What is it you require?
{125031}{125075}Blow out the candles.
{125646}{125722}Behind the mirror, as you know,|there's a flight of stairs.
{125726}{125811}Down below, someone|is waiting to come up.
{125814}{125915}Will His Excellency be kind enough|to open the door for him carefully...
{125918}{125970}so that he can sneak in?
{126866}{126947}Her Majesty is waiting|for you, Captain.
{126950}{127003}Yes, sir.|Thank you, sir.
{127006}{127083}Will you deliver|a message for me, Captain?
{127086}{127135}l would be very glad to, sir.
{127138}{127231}Tell Her Majesty that|l quite understand now.
{127234}{127307}No, never mind.|Don't tell her anything.
{127310}{127379}-She'll know.|-Yes, sir.
{128274}{128355}Something for the poor,|Your Majesty?
{128966}{129011}For the poor, Captain?
{129502}{129547}Excellency?
{129550}{129607}Quite a haul tonight, father.
{129766}{129811}Chancellor?
{130026}{130071}Elizabeth?
{130389}{130477}Your lmperial Majesty,|something for the poor?
{130576}{130657}That was for me.|Now what have you got for the poor?
{130660}{130737}There are no poor in Russia!|Get out!
{131367}{131426}l've had enough of this|sanctimonious talk.
{131429}{131474}Let us drink.
{131477}{131534}Why doesn't he take up|his collections in church?
{131537}{131606}To the most charming|woman in my empire,
{131609}{131687}my friend,|the countess Elizabeth.
{132015}{132133}Go ask Her Majesty, my wife,|why she doesn't join our toast.
{132213}{132272}His Majesty, the emperor of Russia,|wishes me to ask...
{132275}{132325}why Her Majesty refuses|to join the toast.
{132329}{132433}Tell His Majesty that my thirst|is not as great as his tonight.
{132506}{132589}Her Majesty wishes me to convey that her|thirst is not as great as his tonight.
{132593}{132686}Go tell my wife she's a fool.
{132830}{132900}His Majesty wishes me|to inform Her Majesty...
{132903}{132959}that she is a fool.
{133621}{133686}What is your rank, Orloff?
{133690}{133738}Captain, Your Majesty.
{133741}{133794}Well, you're nothing now.
{133945}{134038}Now get out, both of you,|and stay out!
{134481}{134526}Sit down!
{134557}{134602}My wife is not|to leave the palace.
{134605}{134687}She's under arrest|until further orders.
{134737}{134822}Am l the emperor of Russia,|or am l not?
{134825}{134914}We'll issue a proclamation|that she died...
{134973}{135074}and ask the people|to pray for her.
{136141}{136210}Hurry, Your Majesty.|Everything is ready.
{136509}{136554}What are you doing here?
{137337}{137382}Halt!
{137971}{138042}Exit Peter lll.
{138045}{138122}Enter Catherine ll.
{138834}{138927}We, soldiers in the service|of the Holy Russian Empire,
{138930}{139035}do hereby solemnly swear|to acknowledge...
{139038}{139163}and to defend with our lives,|the authority of Catherine our empress,
{139166}{139225}and to destroy her enemies!
{140082}{140131}Your Majesty, we're|sorry to trouble you,
{140134}{140216}But Her Majesty isn't in here, is she?|She's no longer in her rooms.
{140219}{140319}You infernal blockhead!|This is the last place in the world|she would come to.
{140322}{140367}Double the guard!|Surround the palace!
{140370}{140427}Find her|and bring her here to me!
{143766}{143826}God grant you victory,|Catherine.
{143830}{143907}All Russia is waiting|for the sound of our bell.
{144894}{144975}Why are those bells ringing?
{145430}{145475}Why are those bells ringing?
{145478}{145523}l don't know, Peter.
{145526}{145603}How dare you address me like that!|Who are you?
{145662}{145723}My name is Orloff,|and l'm on duty as guard.
{145726}{145771}l'll have your head|for this insolence!
{145774}{145823}You're addressing the emperor!
{145826}{145895}There is no emperor.
{145898}{145963}there is only an empress.
