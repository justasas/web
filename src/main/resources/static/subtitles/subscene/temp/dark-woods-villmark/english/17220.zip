1
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:17,116
Are you there?

2
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,317
Good.

3
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:29,799
All we wanted was a decent job.

4
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:38,797
And we ended up here.
In the woods.

5
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:48,685
We should have stayed away
from that pond.

6
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:15,643
Hi.
Can I smoke here?

7
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:21,922
Why did you apply for this job,
Lasse?

8
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:25,275
I know you're good.

9
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,125
And that you pay well.

10
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:35,405
I hear you're one of the best
photographers around.

11
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:37,757
Who told you that?

12
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:41,639
-Are you Lasse's friend?
-Yes.

13
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:46,599
-What do you do on local radio?
-Haven't you heard my reports?

14
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:50,557
Jesus Christ! I've been
in princess Märtha Louise's bed.

15
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:53,997
I've been in Wenche Foss' shower.

16
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:57,005
Do you have any TV experience?

17
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,721
I've watched a lot of TV.

18
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:05,762
Three years as a reporter
for a ... news desk.

19
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,965
''I'll do what you want me to,
cause I ...''

20
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:21,926
Stop it!
Why do we have to go through this?

21
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:24,515
Sit down.
Give me that!

22
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:32,679
You can't do this without me.

23
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:37,361
Am I right?
Answer me.

24
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,637
Lasse.

25
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,517
Sara.

26
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,842
Elin.

27
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,442
And Per.

28
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:51,397
My philosophy is:
We have to be able to take -

29
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:55,156
- everything our participants
have to take.

30
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,755
And preferably even more.

31
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,645
We have four days
to become a top-notch TV crew.

32
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:07,358
We have to dare
leave our pacifiers behind.

33
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:10,206
The program is as follows:

34
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:18,039
Tomorrow and the day after
will be physically demanding.

35
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,762
Saturday will be
mentally demanding.

36
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,439
Not my cell phone!

37
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:29,082
And Sunday
I have a surprise for you.

38
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:34,281
When we return to civilization
as one hell of a crew!

39
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,605
Are you ready?

40
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:40,400
-Yes.
-I can't hear you.

41
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,882
-Yes!
-Good!

42
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:50,846
Gunnar,
can I make one last phone call?

43
00:04:51,127 --> 00:04:53,641
We'll be back on Sunday.

44
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:57,437
I usually ...

45
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:03,206
I call my mom every day,
and I wanted to let her know ...

46
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:35,644
Consider it part of
the survival experience.

47
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:47,446
Hang on, Lasse!

48
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,925
That wasn't so bad, was it?

49
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:01,323
Are we almost there?

50
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:06,475
-About halfway.
-Did you hear that, Lasse? Halfway.

51
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,962
Is this your cabin?

52
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:57,765
It started as an ammo shed
dad found after the war.

53
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:02,722
But it's seen some improve-
ments since then.

54
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:02,396
Everything OK?

55
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:09,804
Must have forgotten to lock
after last time.

56
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:31,037
Fine, I'll take the bottom bunk.

57
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,880
That hasn't worked for 30 years.

58
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,805
This is a classic Stellaphone.

59
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:55,999
You carried the wine, Lasse.

60
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,842
What wine?

61
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:14,961
We live in an obscure age.

62
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:22,085
People choose entertainment
when they really long for clarity.

63
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:25,836
Something to tell them
how to cope with life.

64
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:28,162
We supply that clarity.

65
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:33,805
Rougher, more audacious,
deeper TV than ever before.

66
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:38,846
We could have sat
at some bar right now.

67
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:42,562
I was just thinking the same thing!

68
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:47,000
But instead we are here.

69
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:54,042
We are going to freeze, starve,
and become clear to each other.

70
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,806
Cheers.
And welcome.

71
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,757
Aren't you drinking?

72
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:10,635
People who don't drink
have some serious flaw.

73
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:11,116
Push those two at the same time.

74
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:18,003
''I can crack big nuts
with my butt muscles.''

75
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:25,156
''Where did that avocado
come from?''

76
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:37,796
Where did that avocado come from?

77
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,277
What is it, Gunnar?

78
00:11:42,047 --> 00:11:44,481
I saw ... forest.

79
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,717
I told you:
Never go up to that pond.

80
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,762
What is it, Gunnar?

81
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:56,796
I saw ... forest.

82
00:11:57,727 --> 00:12:01,481
I told you:
Never go up to that pond.

83
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:10,997
Never go up to that pond.

84
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,962
Bedtime.

85
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,160
Come back here, dammit!

86
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:09,321
Cowardly fuck!

87
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,796
Where's breakfast?

88
00:14:20,687 --> 00:14:26,444
-Don't we get any food up here?
-You'll find it in the forest.

89
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,239
Let's go.

90
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,165
What kind of a deal is this?

91
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:35,286
You go up to the river
behind the cabin.

92
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:41,159
I'll bring the girls, and we'll see
who comes home with dinner first.

93
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,961
Rivers make noise.

94
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:02,721
I don't hear a river.

95
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,402
Are you all right?

96
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,836
I think so.

97
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:28,086
Look at this!

98
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:42,195
Look at that.

99
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:35,046
Fish are fish, meat is food.

100
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,317
Leave it!

101
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,839
Shit!

102
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:47,162
You can't exactly
call that Swedish chick ugly.

103
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:51,926
-Isn't she a little old?
-She isn't old!

104
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:55,602
There's something about Swedes ...

105
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:18,757
Hello?

106
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:54,363
The expiration date
was over a month ago.

107
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,047
On your birthday!

108
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,721
-I hope it's alive.
-Why did you shoot?

109
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:28,204
I don't know.
A reflex.

110
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:33,963
Did you find it?

111
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:37,958
If you're going to shoot,
shoot to kill.

112
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,800
There's blood on your hand.

113
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,556
You wanna play with me?

114
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,836
Come on, Lasse!

115
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,996
-Check this out.
-You look lovely.

116
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,881
This doesn't work.

117
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:46,962
I'll fix it later.

118
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,958
Where did you get that?

119
00:20:56,087 --> 00:21:00,444
We got it
from some helpful German tourists.

120
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:04,517
We found it in a tent by the pond.

121
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:08,043
Put it back.

122
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:14,039
-What's the matter?
-You stole someone else's food.

123
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:18,678
That tent has been deserted
for over a month.

124
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:25,877
We are supposed to behave
like adults. You've already failed.

125
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:09,639
A German plane crashed here
during the war.

126
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:15,963
Grandpa said
this pond never froze in the winter.

127
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:22,562
And we were never
allowed to swim here.

128
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:05,356
Lasse?

129
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:19,878
Now what?

130
00:23:23,607 --> 00:23:26,167
Let me see.

131
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:43,236
Holy shit ...

132
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:22,680
We have to get back to the car
before dark.

133
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:29,965
Another day or two
makes no difference to her.

134
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:32,436
What?

135
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,002
We have to report this.

136
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:40,045
We'll wait
until we head down on Sunday.

137
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,601
-Sunday?
-Stop kidding.

138
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:45,446
Four days
makes no difference to her.

139
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:49,958
-What about her family?
-She'll be just as dead on Sunday.

140
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:55,207
-Have you completely lost focus?
-Let me handle this. Please.

141
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:58,484
Sunday is a good day.
Church is open ...

142
00:24:58,607 --> 00:25:03,476
If you find a body,
you contact the police. Period.

143
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:09,045
What's going on in your head?
We can't leave her another four days.

144
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,727
-Calm down, Lasse.
-Shut up!

145
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:14,998
We'll report it when we get home.

146
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,721
On Sunday.

147
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:20,795
I'm leaving.

148
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:24,358
Home is the other direction, Lasse.

149
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:26,717
Get a grip, Lasse.

150
00:25:29,887 --> 00:25:32,355
This stays between us.

151
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:38,001
There's no point
in frightening the girls.

152
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:42,443
I've never seen a dead body before.

153
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,685
Have you?

154
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:47,275
Wait!

155
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:05,881
Where's Lasse?

156
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:10,043
Hello?
Didn't Lasse go with you?

157
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:14,037
Yes.
But he needed some more fresh air.

158
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:22,245
Will you come with me
to the outhouse, Elin?

159
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:26,237
-Please?
-Are you scared?

160
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:33,922
-Come inside with me.
-Want me to wipe you too?

161
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:43,716
-I'll wait till we get home.
-Sit down and close your eyes.

162
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:49,997
-What does this have to do with TV?
-Don't ask me.

163
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:09,482
Lasse?

164
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:13,516
Hello?

165
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,956
Elin?

166
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:59,925
That wasn't funny, Lasse.

167
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:05,200
-What did you throw at me?
-What's this?

168
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:10,357
What the hell is this?
Blood?

169
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:19,042
Holy shit!

170
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,881
Where did you find that?

171
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:27,287
I didn't put it there.

172
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,686
Elin?

173
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:40,559
-Why did you leave?
-Do you have any cigarettes, Sara?

174
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:43,281
Where have you been?

175
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,761
What is it, Lasse?

176
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:51,164
Do you like it here, Elin?

177
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:54,320
Has something happened?

178
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:14,999
Gunnar was right.
We can't do anything. She's dead.

179
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:20,844
And your mom will be fine
alone for four days.

180
00:30:20,967 --> 00:30:23,435
What's your problem?

181
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:27,355
Gunnar doesn't know
what he's doing.

182
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,720
There's something else out there.

183
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,162
What is this?

184
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,241
Dammit!

185
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:57,520
I put the dead bird
in her sleeping bag.

186
00:30:58,247 --> 00:31:00,715
What is wrong with you?

187
00:31:01,247 --> 00:31:07,004
Probably the most exciting thing
she's had in there for years.

188
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,076
It was a joke, Lasse.

189
00:31:11,607 --> 00:31:15,202
You take everything so seriously!

190
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:04,522
Lasse?

191
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:10,007
Are you asleep?

192
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,240
Hello?
What's going on?

193
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:57,280
This tree has irritated me for years.
It steals all the light.

194
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:02,605
-Shouldn't you be asleep?
-I can never sleep here.

195
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:07,039
Neither can we, with you
chopping away. Please stop.

196
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:18,522
To solve all your problems, you'd
have to chop down the entire forest.

197
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,237
Go to bed.

198
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:54,396
Per ...

199
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:10,121
I had just gotten the panties off
that girl in the video store.

200
00:34:10,327 --> 00:34:14,400
Why can't we even
have cigarettes up here?

201
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:18,759
You don't smoke.
You don't have the same problem.

202
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:22,841
What's that sound?

203
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:28,363
Look out the window
and see who you're working for.

204
00:34:36,887 --> 00:34:39,355
He's insane!

205
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:48,761
-How did you start working together?
-The long or the short version?

206
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:52,243
Long enough so I can fall asleep.

207
00:34:53,687 --> 00:34:58,477
When I was 15 I had
had enough of my dad's new wife.

208
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:03,878
I ran away to Stockholm.
Got a job in a bar.

209
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:08,445
-He came by one night.
-You left home at 15?

210
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:14,039
He had just started a TV company
with his Swedish wife.

211
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:19,839
Jokingly,
I asked if he had a job for me.

212
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:25,446
And he did.
If I had ''what it took''.

213
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:27,883
Tell me more.

214
00:35:28,007 --> 00:35:32,319
Did you ... do anything special
to get the job?

215
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:35,643
No.

216
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:38,197
Go to sleep.

217
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,483
Poker?

218
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:03,284
There.

219
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,323
What?

220
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:13,157
Strip poker.

221
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:22,642
Fine.

222
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:29,640
-You cheat!
-Come on.

223
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:40,044
Are you ready for this?
It's a powerful sight.

224
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:43,282
Come on.

225
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,641
Fine.
I'm chicken.

226
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:57,562
Go get some firewood.

227
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:36,362
Holy shit!

228
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:53,875
Hey. Good morning.
Time to get up.

229
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:21,562
Per?

230
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:27,437
I have something for you in here.

231
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:12,444
It's seven o'clock.
Time to get up.

232
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:20,402
What's the rush?

233
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:26,119
We have a busy schedule today.

234
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:45,125
You scared the shit out of me!

235
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:48,276
-You hurt me.
-How?

236
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,956
Look at this.

237
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:55,122
I didn't touch you.

238
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:58,036
In the tent.

239
00:42:58,847 --> 00:43:03,762
The tent?
I went to find cell phone coverage.

240
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:11,840
What were you doing
over by the tent?

241
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:15,004
I'm never going back to that pond.

242
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:20,605
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from the pond?

243
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,281
I could have sworn I did.

244
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:29,320
Gunnar, Per has something
he'd like to share with us.

245
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:32,605
Thanks for nothing, Judas.

246
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:45,799
I found coverage.
We could have called someone.

247
00:43:46,527 --> 00:43:51,282
If we don't respect my rules,
we can't work together.

248
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:59,685
Everyone but Per
joins me on today's mission.

249
00:44:00,327 --> 00:44:03,558
I haven't even used the outhouse.

250
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:08,678
Finally you can help
someone other than yourself.

251
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:13,602
We'll be back in a couple of hours.
You should be done by then.

252
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:16,759
I'll do anything but this.

253
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,362
Anything.

254
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:31,078
-How about the Star?
-The Star?

255
00:44:31,327 --> 00:44:34,717
An old Indian game
we played when we were kids.

256
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:40,046
Per liked to tie people down and
wait for the ants to come get them.

257
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:42,358
Good idea.

258
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:47,641
Why, Gunnar? You can't punish me
for checking my cell phone.

259
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:50,156
Sure I can.

260
00:44:52,247 --> 00:44:56,001
Gunnar,
forget about your ghosts for once.

261
00:44:56,127 --> 00:45:01,406
I agree with Gunnar. The same rules
should apply to everybody.

262
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:05,520
I want to marry you.
I want you to have my baby.

263
00:45:05,647 --> 00:45:08,445
Gunnar could be your father!

264
00:45:08,647 --> 00:45:11,525
-Not likely.
-Let's go.

265
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:15,005
Lasse, my best friend ...

266
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:17,681
You get to relax.

267
00:45:17,807 --> 00:45:21,277
We have to go out
with the guide from hell -

268
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:25,764
- and do God knows what.
-And I get to stay here.

269
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:38,236
Is this the thanks I get
for fixing that tape recorder?

270
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:44,160
Don't go down to the pond.
There's something in the water.

271
00:45:52,447 --> 00:45:55,644
I want all those logs up here.

272
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:02,442
He's kidding, right?

273
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:05,797
No.

274
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:10,516
Turn it over.

275
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,243
Shit!

276
00:46:38,367 --> 00:46:41,359
-Can't you even carry a log?
-Shut up!

277
00:46:44,967 --> 00:46:47,435
Give up?

278
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:51,565
This'll get the nicotine
out of your body.

279
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:54,759
What are we doing here?
I want to go back to Per.

280
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:57,401
Everything has a purpose.

281
00:46:57,527 --> 00:47:01,725
That you can be macho
in front of the girls?

282
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:06,205
Don't forget
that I'm paying you for this.

283
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:41,559
Now we're curious, Gunnar.

284
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:47,158
-What are you making?
-Ever hear of Sisyphus?

285
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:51,683
Sisyphus tried to cheat death.

286
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:58,322
He was doomed forever in Hades
to roll a boulder up a steep hill.

287
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:03,601
Every time he reached the top,
the boulder would roll back down.

288
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:32,041
Sisyphus was a happy man.

289
00:48:36,927 --> 00:48:42,160
You've worked with him for 15 years,
and let him carry on like this?

290
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:44,482
Yes.
Leave me alone.

291
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:51,960
You need to rest this foot
for a couple of days.

292
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:06,797
You don't need
to always act so tough.

293
00:49:21,847 --> 00:49:24,156
I'm serious.

294
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:29,280
Where's the Gunnar
I enjoy working with?

295
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,801
The one who cares about people.

296
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:38,160
I've never tolerated disloyalty.
You know all about that.

297
00:49:38,327 --> 00:49:43,560
But punishments? And this grind?
What are you up to?

298
00:49:46,687 --> 00:49:49,326
How old is your daughter?

299
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:55,400
Do you get to meet her
often enough?

300
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:05,083
Isn't that more important than
turning these idiots into a team?

301
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:14,278
There's plenty here.

302
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:24,076
Go away!

303
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:49,842
Take it out.

304
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:55,363
It's cool.
Look at all those ants at work.

305
00:50:56,087 --> 00:51:00,797
-They keep the forest clean.
-You're sick, all of you.

306
00:51:01,007 --> 00:51:04,283
Whoever put this here, is sick.

307
00:51:09,247 --> 00:51:11,602
Per?

308
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:23,402
Gunnar?

309
00:51:28,407 --> 00:51:30,682
Per?

310
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,681
He got loose.

311
00:52:11,727 --> 00:52:14,321
Look at this.

312
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,596
Leave it.

313
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:41,964
Let him clean this up himself.

314
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:56,116
Come on.
Let's get this crap out of here.

315
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:20,680
Where could he be, Gunnar?

316
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:25,475
Where is he?

317
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:27,962
He probably went home.

318
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:33,357
And waved this dream job goodbye?

319
00:53:33,487 --> 00:53:38,607
-He wasn't the right type.
-Shouldn't we go look for him?

320
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:57,844
Who goes home
and leaves their keys behind?

321
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,441
I don't like this.

322
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:09,916
Maybe there's something out there.

323
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:22,799
There is something out there.

324
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,157
What?

325
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:34,362
We found something in the pond
by that tent.

326
00:54:36,727 --> 00:54:40,925
Do you want to tell them
what we found, Gunnar?

327
00:54:45,807 --> 00:54:48,241
We found ...

328
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:52,238
... a dead woman in a fishing net.

329
00:54:53,247 --> 00:54:56,319
And we just left her there.

330
00:54:56,887 --> 00:54:59,606
Didn't we, Gunnar?

331
00:55:00,407 --> 00:55:03,683
It happened over a month ago.

332
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:08,318
-Why didn't you tell us?
-Gunnar's orders.

333
00:55:11,847 --> 00:55:14,759
We can't do anything until Sunday.

334
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:19,757
This trip is over. There may be
two people in that pond!

335
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:24,836
You give up at the first sign
of adversity? This is why we ...

336
00:55:24,967 --> 00:55:27,606
Bullshit!
Why didn't you tell us?

337
00:55:27,727 --> 00:55:32,437
The decision to continue
was not an easy one to make.

338
00:55:33,207 --> 00:55:38,884
This is my responsibility.
You are free to leave if you want.

339
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:44,161
But don't expect
to work for me again.

340
00:56:52,647 --> 00:56:54,478
Hi, Gunnar.

341
00:56:55,287 --> 00:57:00,645
I'm sitting here at the Green Bar,
sending smoke signals to Per.

342
00:57:01,967 --> 00:57:06,597
These cigarettes are dry.
They're a month old, after all.

343
00:57:08,847 --> 00:57:11,919
But thank you for a nice trip.

344
00:57:13,927 --> 00:57:18,045
Want a drink
while we wait for Per's return?

345
00:57:19,767 --> 00:57:22,122
Take it easy!

346
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:26,201
Stop these ridiculous punishments.

347
00:57:29,047 --> 00:57:33,040
You're starting to lose control,
Gunnar.

348
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:36,318
I gave you both a fair chance.

349
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:42,645
If anything has happened to Per,
I'm going to sue the shit out of you!

350
00:57:43,247 --> 00:57:45,317
Get in line.

351
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:52,241
Gunnar!

352
00:58:32,327 --> 00:58:34,716
Wasn't Lasse with you?

353
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:39,917
He'll be up there for another hour.

354
00:58:44,807 --> 00:58:47,446
He went back to the tent.

355
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,206
Give me a break, Gunnar!

356
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:55,605
-How's your foot?
-You're starting to lose it.

357
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:58,235
Don't go out there!

358
00:59:00,447 --> 00:59:02,677
Sara!

359
00:59:07,447 --> 00:59:10,166
I've had enough of your shit!

360
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:46,802
Per?

361
00:59:59,447 --> 01:00:02,996
Let's end that pine cone war, OK?

362
01:00:13,207 --> 01:00:15,198
Lasse?

363
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:22,044
I just slapped Gunnar.

364
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:29,561
Good job, Sara.
I'm starting to believe in you.

365
01:00:33,487 --> 01:00:35,796
Did you see Per?

366
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:42,206
He's probably running around
out there in his dress.

367
01:00:43,847 --> 01:00:47,078
How long has he been into that?

368
01:00:52,087 --> 01:00:54,726
Per and I grew up together.

369
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:58,678
He does so many crazy things.

370
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:08,365
But he took this job ...

371
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,477
Because he's in love with you.

372
01:01:15,327 --> 01:01:17,887
How about you?

373
01:01:19,207 --> 01:01:21,767
I'm an old man.

374
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:24,997
Ready to settle down.

375
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:28,802
Shouldn't you leave home first?

376
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:34,364
I plan to have many little Lasses.

377
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:38,196
One there, one over there ...

378
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:41,683
And one that climbs up there.

379
01:01:41,807 --> 01:01:44,480
He's cute!

380
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,637
Hello?

381
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:30,238
Per, are you planning
on burning down the whole forest?

382
01:02:37,647 --> 01:02:40,002
Per?

383
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:57,285
We should get our sleeping bags
and lie down here.

384
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,402
Per?

385
01:03:38,367 --> 01:03:40,676
Are you asleep?

386
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:51,915
Where did you find him?

387
01:05:52,847 --> 01:05:55,236
By the pond.

388
01:05:56,047 --> 01:05:58,561
What's happened?

389
01:06:11,487 --> 01:06:14,320
Do you see what you have done?!

390
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:16,604
Get out of here!

391
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:20,083
Don't go!
We don't know what's out there!

392
01:06:20,207 --> 01:06:22,038
Let him go.

393
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:26,365
We'll just fish him
out of the pond tomorrow.

394
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:51,883
-I'll go down to the car and call.
-I'll go with you.

395
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:54,396
No, stay with Elin.

396
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:07,204
-You both go.
-Are you sure?

397
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:14,677
Lasse?

398
01:07:19,527 --> 01:07:21,836
Be careful.

399
01:07:25,887 --> 01:07:28,276
You too.

400
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,636
Lasse?

401
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:36,596
Lasse?

402
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:11,837
Where have you been?

403
01:10:12,247 --> 01:10:15,637
Up by the tent.
No one was there.

404
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:17,759
Where are the others?

405
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:21,721
Where do you think?
They went to call.

406
01:10:24,927 --> 01:10:26,997
Lasse?

407
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:45,079
The log has been washed out.

408
01:11:03,607 --> 01:11:06,485
They can't be out there now.

409
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:11,163
We shouldn't be here at all!
What is it with you?

410
01:11:11,287 --> 01:11:14,563
You never stop and you never listen!

411
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,396
Sooner or later it will all go to hell!

412
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:23,442
Yes ...

413
01:11:27,327 --> 01:11:32,765
If we survive this night,
we are never working together again.

414
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:36,957
No ...

415
01:11:42,647 --> 01:11:44,922
Help!

416
01:12:00,607 --> 01:12:02,325
Help!

417
01:12:20,487 --> 01:12:23,001
Sara?

418
01:13:32,687 --> 01:13:34,882
Sara!

419
01:14:51,647 --> 01:14:53,603
Hey!

420
01:15:41,207 --> 01:15:43,641
Come on, dammit!

421
01:16:03,487 --> 01:16:05,762
Sara?

422
01:16:51,007 --> 01:16:53,680
Are you there?
Per?

423
01:16:56,127 --> 01:16:58,322
Good.

424
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:02,477
We should have stayed away
from that pond.

425
01:17:02,607 --> 01:17:06,680
-It was their honeymoon.
-He was insane.

426
01:17:15,487 --> 01:17:18,445
They wanted to find the pond -

427
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:23,436
- where his grandfather crashed
during the war.

428
01:17:24,327 --> 01:17:28,400
The police think his wife
drowned in the cold water.

429
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:30,882
Right in front of him.

430
01:17:33,407 --> 01:17:35,716
And he went insane.

431
01:17:38,047 --> 01:17:43,280
When we entered the tent
and found her body, he snapped.

432
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:03,805
You saw it, didn't you, Per?

433
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:09,605
Something isn't right.
