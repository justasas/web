1
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,000
No, man, I'm just saying'-
I'm sayin' if-if you own
the beach property, right...

2
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,760
- Mm-hmm?
- do you own, like,
the sand and the water?

3
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,599
Nobody owns the water.
God owns-It's God's water.

4
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,760
What if someone walks
onto your beach, right?
Let's say if you do own it.

5
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,799
No, man, you don't
own the beach.

6
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,799
- What you own is sand
on the beach, man.
- Here. Here, man.

7
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,040
- What if there's
a naked girl on the beach?

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,040
That girl's not yours.
You don't own the girl.

9
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,000
- What if she breaks
her foot on your property?
- She could sue me.

10
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,280
Sue me! Sue me!

11
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,319
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- Holy shit!

12
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,439
Ditch it, man! Ditch it!

13
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,120
- Dude, can you eat it?
- The whole bag?

14
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,959
Fuck it!

15
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:50,640
Hey, Mike, um,
while you're at it?

16
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,040
- Those are 'shrooms, dude!
- Come on, man, just eat it!

17
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,680
- Mike, uh...

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,159
- I hate to ask, but, uh...for the team?
- I can't eat that!

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,640
- No! Throw it out the window!
- Okay! Okay! Okay!

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,560
All right, I'm doin' a drop.

21
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,680
- I'm goin' for a drop.
-Just opening the window.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,240
- It's gone. It's gone.
- We're cool. It's cool.

23
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,400
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

24
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,879
- We're dead!
- All right, all right.
Windows down! Windows down!

25
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,039
- Windows down!
Put the windows down!

26
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,719
All right, we're cool.
We're cool.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
God, did you see that?

28
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,199
It must have been,
like, a double homicide
or something fuckin' cool.

29
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,439
- We was freakin' out, man.
- Man, I almost had a heart attack.

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,719
Mike, you didn't eat
both those bags, did you?

31
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,520
- Come and get it.

32
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,280
You must have eaten, like,
a hundred bucks worth of pot...

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,520
-and, like, 30 bucks
worth of shrooms, man.
- Who's the man?

34
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,400
So, I'm gonna-I'm gonna need
130 buck, you know...

35
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,719
whenever you get a chance.

36
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,199
- Fuck, man.
- That-That's not really cool, man.

37
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,599
Is that the same car, man?

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,599
- D-Do I look high?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,439
Here they-
Here they come.

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,719
- Lick on it.
Just lick it or somethin'.
- Be cool, be cool.

41
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,159
License and registration.

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,639
Uh, Officer, I know that-

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,639
License and registration, please.

44
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,080
The regis-

45
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,520
- You know how fast you were goin'?
- What?

46
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,759
- How fast you were goin'?
- Uh, 65?

47
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,800
- Sixty-three.
- Officer, isn't-isn't
the speed limit 65?

48
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,919
Yeah, it is.

49
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,120
- Where you boys headed?
- Canada.

50
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,759
C-Canada. We're goin'
over the border to Canada...

51
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,959
- for some french fries and gravy, sir.
- Poutine.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,439
Canada, huh?
Almost made it.

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,160
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.

54
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,199
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, sir.

55
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:34,040
- Now, did you say, "Yes, sir"?
- I think he said, "Yeah, sure."

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,560
- What'd you say, man?
- Well, I said, "Yeah, sure,"

57
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,319
but what, literally, I said
was, "Yeah, sure, sir."

58
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,480
- So you are okay then?
- Yes, sir.

59
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,959
- You smell somethin', Rabbit?
- Fear.

60
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,399
Now hand over
that registration.

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,399
Yes, sir.
My mother's gonna kill me.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,519
Holy, shit. This is-This is-This is-
Don't look. Don't look.

63
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,879
- Oh, my God.
- I don't get it, man.

64
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,879
- Am I fucked up
or is this fucked up, man?

65
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,000
This shit is fuckin' crazy.

66
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,800
Shit, man. I was just
about to pull out my Nine...

67
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,800
and put a cap
in that pig's ass.

68
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,720
- Oh, fuck!

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,519
- Oh, my God!

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,480
- Shit!

71
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Fuck!

72
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,199
Pull the vehicle over!

73
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,199
- I'm-I'm already pulled over, man!
- Pull over farther, man!

74
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,240
- I can't pull over-
Sir, I'm already pulled over!
- He's already pulled over!

75
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,360
He can't pull over any farther!

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,800
License and registration, please.

77
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,439
- But I-I just gave you it, Officer.
- License and registration.

78
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,600
You know how fast
you were goin'?

79
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,560
- Uh, sixty-five?
-Sixty-three.

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm freakin' out, man.

81
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,959
You are freakin' out, man.

82
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,000
You want to know
why I pulled you over?

83
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,480
- Littering.
- Officer, that-that's not ours.

84
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,480
- Candy bars!
- Littering and-Littering and-

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,600
- And, uh-
- Littering and-

86
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,959
Littering and, uh-Littering and, uh-

87
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,480
Littering and, uh-

88
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,319
- Littering
and smoking the reefer.

89
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,600
Now to teach you boys
a lesson, Officer Rabbit
and I are gonna stand here...

90
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,279
- while you three
smoke the whole bag.
- Please, no.

91
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,639
- Please, yes-
- Fuckin'pig!

92
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,279
Mother of God.

93
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,000
Whoo!

94
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:11,279
We're in high-speed
pursuit of a white Miata
headin' southbound on 2-9-4.

95
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,879
Unit 91, come in, 91.
Unit 91, come in, 91.

96
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,800
What are you doing out there, 91?
Quit counting your pubes.

97
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,319
We got a hell-raiser
in a white Miata.

98
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,839
Ninety-one, are you there?
Ninety-one?

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,560
Ninety-one, are you there?

100
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
Hey, good-lookin'.
You catch any speeders today?

101
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,920
- Whoo!
- What the fuck!

102
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,360
- Let's go, 91.

103
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,279
Rabbit, get that gun out!

104
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,399
Aw, Mac, you fucker!

105
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,559
Greetings. 

106
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,799
- You guys are too slow.
- You killed my dummy.

107
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,759
Mac, now I'm gonna pay you.
But I shouldn't, 'cause I knew
it was you the whole time.

108
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,559
Thorny, don't lie
in front of the rookie.
It sets a bad example.

109
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,559
- Foster, where are your shoes?
- What, are you
the shoe police now?

110
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,120
I am, and you owe me
20 laps around the bar. Let's go.

111
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,919
- Your black magic only works
on the rookie.
- That's brown magic.

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,279
- Pay up.
- When do I get to do that?

113
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,480
You'll get your chance,
Rook. Shots?

114
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,600
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of booze.

115
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,759
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- I'm impressed.

116
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,679
-Jesus!

117
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,960
Sorry, boys, you're on duty.

118
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,120
- On your tab, Officer Womack?
- Rookie, pay the lady.

119
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
Unit 23. Come in, 23.

120
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
Unit 23. Come in, 23.

121
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,279
Do you need me out there?
Do you need my assistance?

122
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
- Shut up, Farva.
- I can be there-

123
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,519
Listen, we got the Miata.
We're okay.

124
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,360
What about those
dopers you picked up?
Do you need my assistance?

125
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,960
- The snozberries
taste like snozberries.

126
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,000
- Oh, shit!
- He killed the cops!

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,960
- Oh, shit!
- He killed the cops!

128
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,519
- Get out of the car, man!
- This is a cop car!

129
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,679
- Hello.
- You boys like Mexico?

130
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,639
Yeeeee-hoooooo!

131
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,799
One, two, three, do it!

132
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,960
Oh, go, girlfriend.
I'm your mother.

133
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:40,120
Come on, Thorny.
You're losing to the rookie.
It's embarrassing.

134
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,279
Come on, Rabbit.
You can do it.

135
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, Rabbit, he's killing you.
I got Thorny in front by a lot.

136
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,360
What's the matter, your mama
didn't teach you how to chug?

137
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,039
Come on, Thorn.
Come on, Thorn.

138
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,639
- Ohh!
- Goddamn it.

139
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,240
I am all that is man.

140
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,879
- Every time.
- Finish it up.

141
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,480
See, there you have it.
You're doing it all wrong.
Open your throat, relax the jaw.

142
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,879
Don't forget to cup the balls.
You're never gonna win...

143
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,000
with those thin little
bird lips you got there.

144
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,159
This guy's got these
big old powerful lips.
Am I correct, Thorn?

145
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,240
So much of my authority is
derived from the power right here.

146
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,679
Hey, guys.

147
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,360
Wow.

148
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,159
- Uh, do you have any more syrup?
-Sorry, Urs.

149
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,000
- Why couldn't they chug ketchup?

150
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,399
It's a good thing
you didn't order hash browns.

151
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,639
I mean, if they had been
chugging the ketchup.

152
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,519
You get the score of that
Red Sox game last night?

153
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,480
- I turned it off just after-
- Ah, waiter. There you are.

154
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,399
I will have the enchilada platter
with two tacos and no guacamole.

155
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
- Smy?
- Yeah, Chief, I'll take a chinchilla.

156
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,720
I don't get it. Tacos?

157
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,879
They think I'm Mexican.

158
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,120
You're not Mexican?

159
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,879
Another highway cop?
What, are you guys multiplying?

160
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,080
Yeah, if they can figure
which hole to stick it in.

161
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,000
- Ah, what the fuck?

162
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,320
- Hey, I saw that!
- Sit down, Rando.

163
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,759
- That's it!

164
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right, all right!

165
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,080
- Cut it out, you turkeys!
- He fuckin' started it!

166
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm sorry, Bruce. These boys
get that syrup in them...

167
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,440
they get a little antsy
in their pantsy.

168
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,440
You just can't
keep them under control.

169
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,799
You should keep these dogs
on a leash, John.

170
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,919
Let's go.

171
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,279
- Hail to thee!
- Hail to thee!

172
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,480
- Hail to thee!
- Hey, all right!

173
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,320
Hey, what's up, bone diddlies?
Did I miss the song?

174
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,720
- Sing it again, rookie bitch.

175
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,639
Farva.

176
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,480
- Forgot the coffee.
- My bad, Cap.

177
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,919
All right, all right.
Let's get started.

178
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,279
I got the latest
shit list, gentlemen.

179
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,000
It's down to Flagstone,
Deer Lick and us.

180
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,399
And if we keep up these low numbers,
you can bet your sweet butts...

181
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,039
we're gonna get
the big, ugly ax.

182
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,039
- Who'll bust heads on the highway?
- The goddamn local cops!

183
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,720
-And you better believe
that Grady and his goons...

184
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,000
have got a copy of this list,
so we need to step it up.

185
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,679
Who wants cream?

186
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
Nobody? Okay, no cream.

187
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,879
Foster, how many tickets
did you issue last week?

188
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,519
- Uh, I don't have my figures
here in front of me.
- Three.

189
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,919
- I can't make 'em speed.
- Try hidin'.

190
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,679
- And grow a goddamn
moustache, why don't ya?
- I haven't shaved in two weeks.

191
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,399
- I'm growin' mine.
- Oh, you're growin' yours, are ya?

192
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,799
- I'll tell you when
it's time to grow a moustache.
- Coffee's served!

193
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,320
Oh, no! That's Rabbit's.
That's Rabbit's.

194
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,360
- I get it. It's Rabbit's.
- Oh, look, a bar of soap.

195
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,559
Oh, shit!
I got you good, you fucker!

196
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,559
- Awesome prank, Farva.
- Better than the crap you pull, Frank.

197
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
- Look, fellas...
- Bite it, Rook.
Make him look like a dick.

198
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,840
every Thursday night I walk
into the Lodge to play Hearts...

199
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,159
and they always have my
Old-Fashioned just waiting there.

200
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,679
- I like that.
- Bite it. Bite-

201
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,519
Oh, hell!
Give me the goddamn soap!

202
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,480
We got 50 miles of highway.
That stretch of highway is ours.

203
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,279
I'll be damned if I'll let
Grady and those buttheads
get their hands on it!

204
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,840
Thorny, you're
the ranking officer here.

205
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,879
Let's do your jobs
and keep this place open, huh?
Let's do it. Farva!

206
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,480
Your suspension continues.
Hit the radio.

207
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,519
Oh, yes.

208
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,200
Oh. Oh, local Smokeys
on our turf.

209
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,919
- All right, hit it.

210
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,679
See, that's what O'Hagan
was talking about.

211
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,600
Hi. You guys forget
what color your car is?

212
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,799
- Bye-bye.
- Later, dude.

213
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,279
- Bye-bye.
- Later, dude.

214
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,320
All right,
how about "Cat Game"?

215
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,759
- Cat Game?
What's, uh, what's the record?
- Thorny did six...

216
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,360
-but I think you can do ten.
- Ten?

217
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,759
-Starting right meow?

218
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,879
- Uh, sorry about that.
- All right, meow...

219
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,080
hand over your license
and registration.

220
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,320
- Your registration?
Hurry up meow.
- Oh.

221
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,399
- Sorry.

222
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,080
- There somethin' funny here, boy?

223
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
No, no, no.

224
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,039
Well, then, why you laughing,
Mr. Larry Johnson?

225
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,039
- All right meow, where were we?
- Are you saying "meow"?

226
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,159
Am I saying "meow"?

227
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,840
- I-I-I thought-
- Don't think, boy.

228
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,919
- Meow, do you know
how fast you were going?

229
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,159
Meow, what is so damn funny?

230
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,039
I could have sworn
you said "meow."

231
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,000
- Do I look like a cat to you, boy?

232
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,960
Am I jumping around all
nimbly-bimbly from tree to tree?

233
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:26,759
- No. No.
- Am I drinkin' milk from a saucer?

234
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,039
- No.
- Do you see me eatin' mice?

235
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,039
- Now you stop laughin' right meow.

236
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
Yes, sir.

237
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,360
Meow, I'm gonna have to
give you a ticket on this one.

238
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,399
- But-
- No "buts" meow. That's the law.

239
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,799
It's not so funny meow, is it?

240
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,960
Meow!

241
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,840
Ooo-wee-ooh!

242
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,279
Thanks for washing my car, Rook.

243
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,640
- You know what this is?
- A chamois cloth?

244
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,119
Ha! Lucky guess.
I just lost a buck...

245
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,799
to myself.

246
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,599
- Think that's funny, do you?
- Yeah, I do.

247
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,599
Also heard something funny
about how you got suspended.

248
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,599
Something about
a school bus full of kids?

249
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,400
Oh, you heard that, did ya?
Let me tell you another
funny story, New Jack.

250
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,400
Back in '7 4...

251
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
the great Charlie Rich was
named Country Musician of the Year.

252
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,759
Then in '75, he had to hand
the award off to the new one.

253
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,920
And you know who that was?

254
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,759
Mr. "Sunshine on
My Goddamn Shoulders,"
John Denver.

255
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,880
- Really?
- Yeah. Can you believe it?

256
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,279
- Wow!
- Replaced by John Fuckin' Denver.

257
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,599
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

258
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,759
Well, I'll be damaged
if Mr. Rich didn't pull out
his cigarette lighter...

259
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:02,519
and light that award on fire
in front of everyone.

260
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,039
Do you get it?

261
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:10,400
So you're saying you'll set
my Country Music Award on fire?

262
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm saying when my suspension's up,
you better watch your ass.

263
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,079
Or you'll light my ass on fire?

264
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,880
You wanna go?
You wanna take one?
Make your first move.

265
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,599
Hey! I hate to break up
the honky convention,
but we got a 10-92.

266
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,759
- You wanna
take this one, Rod?
- Hell, yeah!

267
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,880
I bet you do-Ohh!

268
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,319
Nice wax job, Rook.

269
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,319
- Thank you, sir. - You-

270
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,119
What the hell is this?
We got local pigs runnin' around?

271
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,519
How'd the locals beat us here?
We're, like, ten miles out.

272
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,240
Look at this chump.
Oh, Mr. Tough Guy here.

273
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,279
Take a walk, buddy,
take a walk.

274
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,880
Holy shit!
It's a cool Winnebago.

275
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,680
- My Uncle Denny used
to have one just like this.
- Rabbit, put your game face on.

276
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,839
You got it, boss.

277
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,200
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Oh-oh!

278
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,640
- Oh, yes.

279
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,240
- Oh, man!
What happened here?
- Take a walk, sonny.

280
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,319
- This investigation
is already under control.
- Well, now it is.

281
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
- Hey!
- Don't touch
the crime scene, rodent!

282
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,039
Rabbit. Hey, look at that.
Johnny Chimpo.

283
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,000
- Quit slappin' me.
- Would you stop touching
my rookie, Grady?

284
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,359
- Hey, I'll touch you.

285
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,279
This is the Spurbury Police.
Put your hands up
and come outta there!

286
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,480
- Get the fuck out of here!

287
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,400
- Glamor pet.
No dice. Get your tape.
- Okay. Let's cruise.

288
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:13,079
- Sounds like y'all
have a hog problem.
- Oh, watch it, Mac.

289
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,119
Mac, I'm serious.
Be careful, Mac. He's angry.

290
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,039
- He's angry? Well, hello.
- Hey, mark it off.

291
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,759
- Smy, you mark it off.
- Back it up, Grady. I'm serious.

292
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,400
What's the point? Didn't you guys
get shut down already?

293
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,079
- Oh, yeah, that's next week.

294
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,559
Your bust. You know there's
a dead chick in there?

295
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,599
Move it, Ramashit!

296
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,440
- Take it up with O'Hagan!
- Fight, fight, fight!

297
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,759
Get off of me!
Get off!.

298
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,079
I'll give you the fat guy
for Foster and, uh...

299
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,680
how about that
stupid guy for Rabbit?

300
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, you’re gonna
have to be more specific.

301
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,440
- They're both
kinda fat and stupid.

302
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,920
Get these damn handcuffs
off now, Ramathorn!

303
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,359
- Cut him loose.
- Go ahead, Smy.

304
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,839
You want to tell me what bug
crawled up your big ass, Grady?

305
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,960
Yeah, I will tell you.
This is our crime scene.
We are takin' it.

306
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,279
- It's highway.
It's our jurisdiction.
- No. No.

307
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,279
- This highway is closed.
This is our jurisdiction.

308
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,839
Aw, fuck it.
You deal with the hog.

309
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
Hey, Chief.

310
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,680
What in hell's
gotten into you guys?

311
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,839
I told you to be good.
I told you this was a bad time.

312
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,920
But you go ahead and get into
a battle royale with the locals
at a crime scene.

313
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,559
- But they started that fight.
- Of course they started the fight.

314
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,839
Now they've taken
a jurisdictional grievance against us.

315
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,160
They want us to blow it.

316
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,880
I mean,
a murder on the highway...

317
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,480
and you give them
the investigation.

318
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,240
Christ! We look like
a bunch of pussies.

319
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,720
All right,
come on out, Rabbit.

320
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,200
I guess I just go
take a shower then, huh?

321
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,400
Ow!

322
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,920
Strike three!
You're out of there!

323
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,559
All right, good cut, Ruthie.
Good cut. Come on.

324
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,759
Next batter! Batter up!
Next batter! Let's go.

325
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,799
But, Thorn,
if they do shut you down...

326
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,839
maybe you could
stick around here?

327
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,960
I don't know,
get a different job?

328
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,279
You can always
come work in my shop.

329
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:06,279
Yeah, retired cop goes to work
for his hippie girlfriend
in her head shop. Too sitcom.

330
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,400
Okay. You better pay
attention, Coach. Our son's up.

331
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,440
All right, Arlo.
Watch the ball. Get a hit.

332
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,640
You got it.

333
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,799
- Let's do it.
- All right, Arlo.

334
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,279
- Whoa!

335
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:34,119
- Hey, you gotta keep on your toes.
- Do somethin' about that, ref.

336
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,599
Sorry-ass local cops.

337
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,759
You think you have a nice
relationship with someone...

338
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,599
based on professional courtesy
and mutual boredom.

339
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,119
The next thing you know,
they're trying to take you out.

340
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,240
What? What?

341
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,839
I don't wanna get transferred.

342
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,400
- Have to go be a rookie again
with a bunch of random dudes.
- Don't worry about it.

343
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,279
If it happens, we'll, uh,
we'll all just stay here,
open up a roller disco.

344
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,799
Throw him the heat.
Bring it on.

345
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,079
Uh, anybody want a corn dog?

346
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,119
See if they got any
chocolate bananas. Foster?

347
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,839
Ohh!

348
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,319
Hey, Charlie's Angel.

349
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Hey, congratulations.
You're the one millionth
person to say that to me.

350
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,400
- Oh. What do I win?
- Ooh. Um...

351
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,519
Ahh. There you go.

352
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,519
Hope I don't get brain freeze.

353
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:35,519
I'm not sure you've
got the required equipment.

354
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,319
So, listen, I, um, had a really good
time at that Winnebago fight.

355
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,359
Maybe, uh, I don't know,
we could do it again sometime.

356
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,240
All right, all right.
Fair is fair.

357
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,319
You can slug me back
if you want to.

358
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,160
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah.

359
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,839
Hold my snow cone.

360
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,799
- Okay.
- Heads up!

361
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400
- Hey, what happened over there?

362
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,200
What? Wh-Why?

363
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,720
How about a little pep, hmm?

364
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,880
From those guys over there.

365
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,599
Assholes.

366
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,160
You want to move that,
buddy. Now!

367
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,240
- So, about my field time.
- Yeah, yeah. I've been
thinkin' a lot about that.

368
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,759
I think I might be able
to talk to Grady for you.

369
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,200
- Pink stick, eat it or lose it.
- Hey, shut your pie hole, buddy.

370
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,799
I mean, because I'm ready
to go out on patrol.

371
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm goin' nuts being
on the radio all the time.
I'd like to get some field work.

372
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,880
Yeah? Why don't you take your radio
and go stand in a field.

373
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Move that gigantic
cotton candy!

374
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,920
Goddamn it! How's the view
from sugar heaven, bitch?

375
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,720
Hi. I'm looking for Chief Grady.
I have some files for him.

376
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,079
Grady's not here.
I'll take the file.

377
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,960
- It's kind of important.
How about Officer Rando?
- Nope.

378
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,920
What do you need?
I'm the only one here?

379
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,480
There are no
male officers around?

380
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,799
Just give me the file.

381
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
What's this?

382
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,000
So you originally
from Vermont or, uh, or what?

383
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,960
You know,
you've got a lot of courage,
walkin' into the lion's den.

384
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,279
- Oh, I got brass buns.
- Mm. You should join the band.

385
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,440
What are your cells,
eight by eight?

386
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,279
Ours are nine by nine.
No big deal.

387
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:51,240
Listen, you seem
like a really nice guy,
but I just don't date cops.

388
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,599
I'm not much of a cop, really.
More like a civilian
trapped in a cop's body.

389
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,480
Oh. Well, I hear you can
get an operation for that.

390
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,759
But then, I guess you'd miss out
on all those wacky things
you highway guys do.

391
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,279
Yeah, those stories about us
are mostly lies, really.

392
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,640
Except for the one about how
we pulled over AC/DC's bus...

393
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,880
and then they flew us down
to Jamaica to party with them;
that one's true.

394
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,799
- But, yeah, other than that,
it's pretty boring out there.

395
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,839
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't know.

396
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,119
All right, it's probably time
for you to get out of here.

397
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,359
- I don't want to get fired too.
- Oh, I'm not getting fired.

398
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,319
I'm gettin' shut down.
That's a big difference.

399
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,880
- In our cells,
the door is over here.
- Right.

400
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,799
A couple of hyenas.

401
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,680
Well, you know,
they are speeding.

402
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,319
- Come in, Radio.
- Don't call me Radio, Unit 91 .

403
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,039
Then don't call me Unit 91, Radio.

404
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:54,359
- Are you done?
- Yeah, okay, Radio.

405
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,680
We got a suspicious vehicle.
White Caprice, Vermont plates.

406
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,880
Tijuana-Gringo-Water-Fiver-Zero.

407
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,200
- Roger. Checking.
- Thank you, Radio.

408
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,880
Unit 91, that license plate belongs
to a local Spurbury police vehicle.

409
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,559
It does? Oh, my God!

410
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,839
- Very funny, 91 .
- Thank you, Radio.

411
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,440
Whoa! Looks like
that truck's planning on
skipping the weigh-in.

412
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,599
Yeah, well, you don't weigh in,
you don't wrestle.

413
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,880
Whoa!
What's this jack-off doin;
trying to pull him over?

414
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,359
There's no fuckin' way
that is happenin'.

415
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,960
-What the hell's he doin'?
- I got somethin'.

416
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,039
Yeah. That's right, doofus.
Move it along.

417
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,039
You, uh, wanna do "Repeat"?

418
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,200
Do you wanna do "Repeat"?

419
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,720
No. I've been thinking a lot
about what the captain said.

420
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,759
- I'd like to play it
straight this time, okay?
- Okay.

421
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,119
- For O'Hagan.
- For O'Hagan.

422
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,400
Good morning.

423
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,799
Would you mind
stepping down from there with
your license and registration?

424
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,200
- Sure. I was just-
- Good morning.

425
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,759
Would you mind
stepping down from there with
your license and registration?

426
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:20,000
- Yeah. No problem.
- Excuse me one second. No.

427
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,799
Excuse me one second. No.

428
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,400
Did, uh, I do something
wrong, officers...

429
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
because I know
I wasn't speeding.

430
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,119
- Why didn't you weigh in?
- Yeah, why didn't you weigh in?

431
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,400
Did I miss that weigh station?

432
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
They got me runnin'
so many miles...

433
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:41,519
I just must have
dazed out and well-

434
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,599
I'll pull into the next one
and get weighed, okay?

435
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,839
What are you
pulling back there?

436
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Well, uh,
mostly just soap, I think.

437
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,960
Why don't we take a look?

438
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,799
Listen, Officers, I'm on a really
tight schedule. I really need to-

439
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,519
Let's go, Mr. Galikanokus.

440
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,839
Well, you heard him.
Let's go, Mr...

441
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,359
Mr. Galonukum.

442
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,079
Hop on up.

443
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,119
Okay-silly-dilly-dokey-o.
I'm an idiot.

444
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Yeah, that's true.

445
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,799
Sorry about the light there.

446
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,720
I have a flashlight in the cab.

447
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,880
- Hey! Mr. Galikanokus!
- Whoa!

448
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,000
- Mr. Galikanokus!

449
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,160
- We should have seen that comin'.
- We should have seen that comin'.

450
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,880
- It is time to stop now, Mac.
- It is...

451
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,079
time to stop now, Mac?

452
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,519
And that was
the second time I got crabs.

453
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,519
- Awesome.
- Afternoon.

454
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,519
- Hey.
- Hey.

455
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,880
- It stinks like sex in here.

456
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,359
What happened?

457
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,480
We got a little distracted by
somebody doin' the "Repeater."

458
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,759
- Huh. That'll happen.
- That will happen.

459
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,799
Well, you did it this time.

460
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,200
- Fishin' your car out
of Lake Leblanc right now.
- Oh, man.

461
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,400
Nah, we just parked it
across the street.

462
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,119
All right, listen. Next time
this kind of thing happens...

463
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,759
I want you to stop,
take a deep breath...

464
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,720
- and pull your heads out of
each other's asses, would ya?
- Language.

465
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,240
It's easy for you to say.
He's got a tiny little head.

466
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,920
Yeah. What's this guy movin'?

467
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,480
Yeah. What's this guy movin'?

468
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,559
Soap, I think.

469
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,519
Reefer.

470
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,759
Whoo-hoo!
That's one stinky pyramid.

471
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,440
We should've built
a stinky igloo and climb in.

472
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,920
- That's a lot of pot.
- Thinkin' back to your tour days
with the Dead, Rabbit?

473
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,480
- Better lock this shit up, huh, buddy?
- What are you talkin' about?

474
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,839
Enhance.

475
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,079
Enhance. Enhance.

476
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,240
Just print the damn thing!

477
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:09,359
All right, what do we know
about this Galikanokus guy?

478
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,799
It's a fake name,
fake license.

479
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,000
- Bunty Soap?
- Fake soap company.

480
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,920
- What, plastic fake?
Decorative fake? What?
- No, like they don't exist.

481
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,880
So, we got 150 kilos
of marijuana and no arrests.
We got nothin'.

482
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,880
I got a theory, Cap.

483
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,200
These, uh, bales of pot,
they have that red Johnny Chimpo
sticker on them.

484
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,559
And that dead woman
in the Winnebago had the same
logo tattooed on her back.

485
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,720
See, a lot of drug dealers
use stickers to mark their
products. Like a brand name.

486
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,400
See! Where'd you learn that,
Cheech? Drug school?

487
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,039
Shut up, Farva.

488
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:45,240
Did that bag you pulled off those
college kids have that sticker?

489
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:48,079
Um...

490
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,519
I don't believe it did.

491
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,799
- Was there any marijuana
on that Winnebago?
- Nope.

492
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,759
A monkey tattoo.
Sounds kinda flimsy.

493
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,079
What's the significance
of this John Chimpo fella?

494
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,200
- Uh, well, you know those really
cheap Japanese cartoons?

495
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,359
No? This is basically
a cheaper Afghani knockoff.

496
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,160
It's this monkey that basically
travels around the world...

497
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,160
uh, doing nasty things.

498
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,799
His butler tries to
keep him in line, but, uh- No.

499
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,440
It's really funny, Cap.
It's Afghanistanimation.

500
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,519
The monkey has a butler?
Great.

501
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,640
- Is that what
they do in Arabia, Thorny?
- How the hell should I know?

502
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,640
-All right. Somebody get me
a VTR copy of this thing.

503
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,160
I'll talk to Grady, see if he'll let
us take a look at the Winnebago.

504
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,319
All right.
You ready for the photo shoot?
Okay, fellas, let's take it.

505
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,039
- Pull down your pants.
- Shut up, Farva, you idiot.
Come on, do it.

506
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:53,119
-John. I'm not
interrupting, am I?
- Mad Timber!

507
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,960
- No. Come in, come in.
- Good work, gentlemen,
all the way around.

508
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:02,119
- Could I get in on that?
- Sure. Why not?

509
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,799
- Excuse me. Good work.
Good work, Officer.
- Hey.

510
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,319
You're gonna have a hard time
shutting us down now,
right, Mr. Mayor?

511
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,079
We got a murder one day,
a drug bust the next.

512
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,800
I'm thinkin' we need
as much police as we can get.

513
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,840
- That'd be a good slogan, wouldn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,639
Tell that
to the budget committee.

515
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,000
I just got off the phone
with Governor Jessman...

516
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,960
and she's gonna be
swinging through here
on her way to Burlington.

517
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,840
- Give me a gun, huh,
to hold for the pictures.

518
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,360
- Rabbit, run. Gun.
-And, John...

519
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,880
as far as this brawling with
the local police is concerned-

520
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,360
It won't happen again, Bill.
I'm onto it.

521
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Good.

522
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,519
'Cause when the governor
shows up, I'm gonna throw her
a little party.

523
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,320
We're gonna let her know
just how this community feels
about its law enforcement.

524
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,320
Spread it on!

525
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:56,400
Come on, Dad!
Faster! Faster!

526
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,239
-So what's the deal
with you and Bobbi?
- Come on, Dad!

527
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,079
You guys are goin' out, but you,
um, sleep with other people?

528
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,559
Well, I mean, yeah.
Not really. Kind of.

529
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,199
It's sort of a long story,
all right?

530
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,440
Well-Hey, Arlo, does Mom
ever have any friends over?

531
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,239
- Any older boys?
- Can't we turn the siren on?

532
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,360
In a minute, all right?
Are you listening?

533
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,400
- Does she have anyone over
that maybe you call uncle?
- Like Uncle Fred?

534
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,400
Uncle Fred?
Who's Uncle Fred?

535
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,000
He's this crazy bird on TV.

536
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,199
- He's crazy.
He flies around like a pigeon.
- Oh, right.

537
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,800
Uncle Freddy, he's great.
He's a crazy bird.

538
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
Okay.

539
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,239
We got one.

540
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,800
You wanna
take this one, kid?

541
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,719
- What about you?
- I gotta stay with little "A."

542
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,800
- You're okay, right?
- Sure.

543
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,760
- Go on. Make mama proud.
- All right.

544
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,880
Yeah, Farva, I got a Porsche,
brown, Washington plates-

545
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,880
- Eight-Donna-Peanut-Eunuch.
- Roger. Checking.

546
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,119
- Kill it.

547
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,920
Can I please see your license
and registra-

548
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,559
I'm sorry, Officer,
for the speeding violation.

549
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:20,440
I am so used to driving
on the Autobahn.

550
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,599
Uh-What?

551
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,760
...Sean Cassidy.

552
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,920
Yummy, yummy.

553
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,639
- Nicht?

554
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,119
- Do you know why
I pulled you over?
- We were driving way too fast.

555
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,119
-Ja.
-Ja.

556
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,280
Officer,
this is a major problem...

557
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,679
because I cannot afford another
ticket with mein Porsche.

558
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,599
Is there maybe something
I can do for you, hmm?
Or maybe my wife...

559
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:54,800
could do for you
to avoid this dilemma?

560
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,280
Is there maybe something
you would like me to do to you?

561
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,280
Or maybe something you would
like to do to me? Hmm?

562
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,159
Uh, 'cause you were
doing 90 in a 65.

563
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,960
Perhaps some spanking
or cuffing is in order.

564
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,519
Could you hold on a minute?
Just a minute. I'll be right back.

565
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,679
- Twenty-three, that Porsche is hot.
- Are you sure?

566
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:52,079
Rabbit?

567
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:55,559
- Please, Thorn, not now. No.
- He can join too, if you like?

568
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,920
- Get over here.
- Tickle, tickle.

569
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,880
-Ja.
- Hold on a second.
Just one second, huh?

570
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:07,880
- What?
- Farva said that car is stolen.

571
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,880
What? Stolen?

572
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,239
-Shit!
- Is there a problem, officers?

573
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,079
Hold on! Come on, Thorn,
I need this.

574
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,199
Look, kid, any other day,
I'd step in here
and show you how to swing.

575
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,559
But the car's stolen.

576
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,920
Goddamn it!

577
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,320
You got to get over there
and you got to cuff her.

578
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,519
- Do it!
You're a highway patrolman.

579
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,639
Cut it out! Do it.

580
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,639
- Now turn that off
and step out of the car, sir.

581
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:40,400
- This is no problem, hmm?
- Put your hands on the car
and spread 'em.

582
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,719
-Ah, now some fun for both of us.
- Get back in the car!

583
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,719
Rabbit, get over
there and cuff her.

584
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,199
- Up against the car.
- Ma'am, I hate to do this
to you, but would you-

585
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,000
- would you please put
your hands behind your back?
- Now things are getting kinky.

586
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,400
- Arlo!

587
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,360
- I love your-
- I'm on the radio.
Come in, Farva.

588
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,239
- Arlo! Rabbit! Let's go!

589
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:07,599
Climb up on Uncle Rabbit's
lap, Arlo, okay?

590
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,320
- I don't think that's
such a good idea, Thorn.
- Uh, right.

591
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,920
Okay, why don't you just
sit in the middle, buddy?

592
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
Ursula, what the fuck?
There's no T.P. in the bathroom.

593
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,320
- What about the piece
stuck to your shoe?
- What about that piece?

594
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,480
Shit!

595
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:31,159
You know, you might
get ahead around here
if you made the extra effort.

596
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,880
- Do you want me
to wipe your ass?
- That's not what I-

597
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,599
Well, around my house,
my wife knows to refill the T.P.

598
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:44,599
- I'm not your wife, Smy.
- No. And if you were, I'd take
you down a peg or two.

599
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,239
Ooh.

600
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,360
Hi, douche bag.

601
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,480
- You know, if you were my wife...

602
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,000
I'd massage your feet every
night until you fell asleep.

603
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:59,840
Nice try.

604
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,519
He strangles her
and puts her face in pig food?

605
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,639
What an asshole.
Got any I.D. on the corpse?

606
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,679
Yeah. "Jane Doe."
Do you know her?

607
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:12,840
Oh, we're working on it.

608
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,119
It's called
routine police work.

609
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,519
Apparently,
she had a cartoon monkey
tattooed on her back.

610
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:21,039
John Chimpo, I'm told.

611
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,480
And those cannabis bags
in our truck...

612
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:30,880
those stickers had
the same monkey logo.

613
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,159
So we think there might be
some kind of connection.

614
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:38,639
Are you suggesting
that a cartoon monkey is
bringing drugs into our town?

615
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,239
- Look, I know
we don't like each other.
- I like you.

616
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,719
Come on! I'm looking
for a little cooperation here.

617
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,639
John Chimpo.

618
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,760
- Hanson, could you round up,
uh, Johnny Chimpo...

619
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,440
and, uh, Jerry Giraffe
and Arty the Alligator
and bring them in for a lineup.

620
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,920
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Sounds like they're having fun.

621
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,400
That's what happens when
you start hanging out
with a state trooper.

622
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,000
We show you the funny.

623
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,599
Well, where were we?

624
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,159
Uh, you were laying
your best rap on me
and I was resisting.

625
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,440
- But you were starting
to think about it.

626
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,800
- I told you.
I don't touch highway hog.
- Baby, I'm Sizzle Lean.

627
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,800
I scratched your back, Bruce.
I scratched it good and hard.

628
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,000
Now, either you scratch my back
or you're gonna get my size ten
boot up your ass!

629
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:31,079
Desperation is
a stinky cologne, John.

630
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:36,920
Let's see. You are an expendable
line item on a state spending bill.

631
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,440
You have a station full
of crappy cops.

632
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,239
I am about this far away
from having a bigger budget.

633
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,239
And now, you come in here
talking about...

634
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,159
monkey tattoos on some
drunk lady's tit like it's
a goddamn drug conspiracy.

635
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,599
Keep your bags packed, John.
Let us handle the real
police work, huh?

636
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:04,440
Uh, John, when you do
get shut down, you come back,
talk to me.

637
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,599
I can always use
a good meter maid.

638
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,719
Let it roll.

639
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,480
- Come and get me, Mac.

640
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,079
- See you later, sucker!
- Ohh! Ohh! Fuck!

641
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,639
Can't catch the Rabbit.

642
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:10,239
- Damn it!
- Out of the car!
Out of the car, scumbag!

643
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,840
Well, hello, Shirley.

644
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,960
- Come on, Farva, man.
Same team. Same team.

645
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:18,000
What's Thorny
going to say, Rook?

646
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,800
- Honestly, Bobbi.
I think it's gonna happen.

647
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,280
We don't want to leave.
We really like this town.

648
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,559
I'll probably just get
sent down to Brattleboro.
It's a nice town.

649
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,199
I don't think it's
a healthy time for him to move.

650
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,559
- He's got a lot
of real good friends here.

651
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:35,639
Who? That creepy kid
with the lisp?

652
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:38,320
Hey. Stop jumping on the bed.

653
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,519
Look, I don't want to go
without you.

654
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,320
- Then you should stay here.
- But I can't if they transfer me.

655
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,280
Hey, stop jumping
on the bed.

656
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,280
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

657
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,440
Hey, honey, it's almost
Mitternacht, huh?

658
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,440
Uhh. We really should
be getting back to the jail.

659
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:04,440
- You don't want us
turning into pumpkins.

660
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,119
Thorn, can't they just
stay a little longer?

661
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,960
All right.
Who wants a mustache ride?

662
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,639
- I want one. I want one!
- I do! I do! I do!

663
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:22,679
- Spurbury Police.
- Oh, thank the Lord.
Thank the Lord. It's terrible.

664
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,920
Oh, there's a disgusting
pervert flashing people.

665
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,920
Ma'am, I need you
to calm down.

666
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,639
I can't calm down!
You calm down! Oh, my God!

667
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,440
- Ma'am, tell me your location.
- He's right in front of the building...

668
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,960
on 323, uh, Karuna Street.

669
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,119
- That's this address, ma'am.
- Oh, well, then,
maybe you can see him.

670
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,239
He's right in front of the building.
Go look. I'll hold.

671
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:47,199
Whoo-aaah!

672
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,639
Did you see him?
Oh, he's disgusting.

673
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,679
- He certainly is, ma'am.
- Oh, I think he's going
to the window again.

674
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,280
Whoo-ooo-ooo!

675
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,159
Oh, the humanity!
He's so bulgy. He's like a moose.

676
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,800
Oh, no! I think
he's going back again.

677
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,800
-Freeze, motherfucker!

678
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,159
Oh, God! Please don't
shoot me. I-I'm naked.

679
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,320
Drop your coat
and grab your toes.

680
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,000
- What?
- I'm gonna show you
where the wild goose goes.

681
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,760
Oh, this isn't happening.
I-I-I'm a police officer. Ursula, help!

682
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,039
Baby, I'm gonna
butter your bread.

683
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,280
You don't have these
at your station?

684
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:41,000
I don't suppose
you got a pair of fresh
underwear I could borrow?

685
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:43,719
I'm not sure you could
fit into my panties.

686
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,039
You know, you can't
tell anybody about this.

687
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:55,800
- I already told
my mom about you.

688
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,599
- Ohh! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

689
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:14,320
- Shit!
- Baby, you rocked me.

690
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,639
Wow! What is this?

691
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:29,440
- Rabbit, you're off the road!
Shut up, Farva!
- It's a good move, Cap.

692
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,360
Rabbit, you're on radio.
Farva, you're ridin' with Thorny.

693
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,159
- Wait a minute-
- What do you want me
to do about it?

694
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:37,519
My hands are tied!
It's all over the police band!

695
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,840
Rabbit, you couldn't
have picked a worst time!

696
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,840
I got a Q-17 request form today.

697
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,280
We have to inventory
our equipment.

698
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,000
Which means our balls are
this close to the band saw.

699
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,440
What are you sellin',
Mac, hot dogs?

700
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:56,239
- There's a new billboard.
- Casino le Fantastique?

701
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,840
- Let me guess.

702
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,519
You just humped the mayor's wife
and burnt down City Hall.

703
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,119
I'll do you one better,
Captain.

704
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:08,599
So I'm walkin' down
by the local police station,
minding my own business.

705
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,159
But there's something
funny in the air.

706
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,199
I feel like I just gotta
get into that Winnebago.

707
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,840
- So after I jimmy the door,
I do a quick recon.
- Bullshit.

708
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,119
I can see there's something
not right about that bed.

709
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,440
- So I busted it in.
- Bullshit.

710
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,679
And just sittin' there
were ten huge duffel bags
of these mothers.

711
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,320
Let me get this straight.
You went into the impound,
scaled the fence...

712
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,800
broke into the Winnebago
and smashed the bed,
all on a hunch?

713
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,719
I'll believe that when me shit
turns purple and smells like
rainbow sherbet.

714
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,840
What? Do you think
I just grew this weed?

715
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,679
How could you know
to look underneath the bed?

716
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,960
It must have been my sixth-
or even my seventh sense.

717
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,039
You know, Rabbit,
a good cop doesn't really
know why he does anything.

718
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,559
- Disregard that, Rabbit.
- And you didn't even think
to call in your partner?

719
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,800
So these local mothers
have got a hundred keys
of chiba and don't know it?

720
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,320
Not a clue.
It's totally hidden.

721
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,039
And Grady's walkin' around
like he's hot soup.
All right, we got a chance here.

722
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:12,280
But we got to beat
these guys to the punch.

723
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,159
Mac, you and Foster
check out the truck stops...

724
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:18,719
and find out what you can
about Galikanokus and Bunty Soap.

725
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,480
I'll talk to Grady
and play a little hardball.
Thorny, I'm takin' a hard line.

726
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:25,760
You got to promise me
no more bullshit.

727
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,639
Cap, you know I'm cool,
but I can take no responsibility
for these white devils.

728
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,559
Well, you're gonna have to.

729
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:35,960
Now, Rodney, we're under
a lot of pressure here.

730
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,800
Remember what we talked about.
If anything happens...

731
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,719
count to ten,
take some deep breaths.

732
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
Ten deep breaths.
I got it, Cap.

733
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,039
Foster, you’re on duty.

734
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:49,280
Trust me, skipper,
we'll make you proud.

735
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,159
- You are awesome.

736
00:49:55,239 --> 00:50:00,480
- You are incredible.
You are a fantastic cop.
- Keep goin'.

737
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,400
Uh, and then somebody said,
I think it was O'Hagan, said, um...

738
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,800
- "Foster,
you deserve a promotion."
- Hmm. I think you get a star.

739
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,280
Mm. Foster? Wait.
I don't know if this is gonna work.

740
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,800
- This steering wheel
is jabbing my ass.
- Oh, right.

741
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,719
Ow! Okay.

742
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,920
In New York City, a guy
could pay ten bucks to watch
two cops have sex in a cage.

743
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,119
Yeah? 

744
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,599
Oh.

745
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:48,280
- Foster?
- Yeah?

746
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,960
In our cruisers,
somebody has to let you out
of the back seat.

747
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,519
Oh, fuck it!

748
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,599
Do we look like
the two dumbest guys
in the world to you?

749
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,239
Is that why
you choose to treat us
with such disrespect?

750
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,519
Look, all I'm sayin', man,
is switch partners. It'll be fun.

751
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,000
- I don't think so.
- Come on, mix it up a bit.

752
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:17,039
- Mm, no fuckin' way.

753
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:21,440
Come on, Mac,
you know you're always sayin'
how funny Foster smells.

754
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,159
- Oh, look out for Thorny,
master of psychology.
- Do I really smell?

755
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,960
All right, assholes,
quit talkin' about me.

756
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:32,559
Lock and load, Ramathorn.
Let's kick some tail.

757
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,320
- We weren't talkin' about you,
you big idiot.
- Bullshit.

758
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,920
- Truck stop, huh?
- We gotta do it.

759
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,400
But the captain
didn't say anything
about going undercover.

760
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,400
Do you think they're
gonna tell us anything
if they know we're cops?

761
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,679
Get a job, man!
Look, you're fuckin' super cop.
You should know this.

762
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,679
- I am super.
- Plus, we can't take our car...

763
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,880
until they replace the door you,
for no reason whatsoever,
removed last night.

764
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,599
I told you it was those kids
with the wrenches.

765
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,599
Ah, yes, those ballsy little punks
who took your car door off...

766
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:03,639
while you were sittin'
in the damn thing.

767
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,719
I told you
I was in a very deep sleep.

768
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,920
Yeah. You wanna
tell that to O'Hagan? Maybe
we can borrow his car today.

769
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,239
Do you even know
how to drive this thing?

770
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:36,719
Shit! This rig sucks!

771
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,719
Aha!

772
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,800
Uh, who knew it was a stick?

773
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,400
How about we, uh,
pop a couple of Viagra...

774
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,599
and issue tickets
with raging, mega-huge boners?

775
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,599
Only you, Farva,
can make a dark man blush.

776
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,519
- And, no, we're not doin' it.
- Ah, hell.

777
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,960
- Hey, I came up with
a great name for our car.
- Oh, yeah?

778
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,320
Get this.
You're Arcot Ramathorn-Ram-

779
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,920
and I'm Rod Farva-Rod;
car Ramrod.

780
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,400
Car Ramrod. You get it?

781
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,039
- Yeah, I got it.

782
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:36,599
- Rabbit, I got
a Plymouth Voyager...
- Say "Car Ramrod."

783
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:39,199
- Say "Car Ramrod."
- Vermont plates-Hold on.

784
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,280
Vermont plates-Alpha...

785
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,599
God-Mustard-
One-Niner-Decade-China.

786
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,719
- Check it. Roger, 23.

787
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,960
- You didn't say it.
I wrote it on the paper.
- Oh, I forgot.

788
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,639
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, Ramathorn,
what game are we playin'?

789
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:57,079
- What? No games.
- Don't bullshit me.

790
00:53:57,159 --> 00:54:01,159
Let's play one of those games
I keep hearin' about.
You know, Mac and Foster...

791
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,199
did that thing, you know,
with the "who can say
pussy the most."

792
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,840
You know, actually,
Mac bet Foster he couldn't
say "meow" ten times.

793
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,159
To the driver.

794
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,599
- I realize that doesn't
sound funny as I described-
- Who can say "meow" the most?

795
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:20,599
You guys are real crazy.

796
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:22,639
Hey, look out for these guys!

797
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,280
Hell, I can say "meow."
I can say "moo."

798
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,679
For 20 bucks, I'll call the guy
a chicken-fucker.

799
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,000
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.

800
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,519
License and registration...
chicken-fucker! Brawwk!

801
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:46,880
- Bruce? John O'Hagan.
-John!

802
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,760
I'm glad you called. Listen. I have
Bobby the Baboon in lockup...

803
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,639
and he says that for
twenty bananas he'll
provide evidence...

804
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:58,480
Johnny Chimpo is the pimp
in charge of the Cartoon
Network whorehouse.

805
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:01,639
Look, I'm done dickin' around.
We got new evidence
on your murder.

806
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:04,480
Who? Galikanokus?
You know where he is?

807
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:07,119
- No, we don't know
where he is, but-

808
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:09,320
Then I don't see how you can
possibly help us, then.

809
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,840
Okay. This is my last offer.

810
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,880
Either you let us in
on this investigation...

811
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,079
or I'm gonna
embarrass you personally.

812
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:19,119
Oh, how embarrassed?

813
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,519
Like, naked in a dream
embarrassed?

814
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:26,360
No, no. Embarrassed like back
in '77, when you got caught
fuckin' your cousin embarrassed.

815
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,360
She's not my cousin.

816
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,400
Welcome to Dimpus.
Can I take your order?

817
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,519
Give me a, uh,
double bacon cheeseburger.

818
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,400
Double baco cheeseburger.
It's for a cop.

819
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,440
- Roger.
- What the hell's that all about?

820
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,960
- He gonna spit in it now?
- No, I was just tellin' him
that so he makes it good.

821
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:55,039
Don't spit in
that cop's burger.

822
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,519
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Roger. Hold the spit.

823
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,360
Give me a, uh, pie.
Apple.

824
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,480
Do you want me
to hold the spit?

825
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:05,559
Just kidding,
Officer...Farva.

826
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,280
So, do you want to
"Dimpisize" your meal
for a quarter more?

827
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,519
Want me to "punchisize"
your face for free?

828
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,760
Some male figure?
I'm his dad. And stop with
the whole transfer thing.

829
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,800
- Oh, Christ.

830
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,280
You know what?
I gotta go. Let's talk
about this later, okay?

831
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,960
- Okay. Bye.

832
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,719
- Now don't give me any lip.
- It's just a quarter, and
look how much more you get.

833
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,679
- I said no!
- It's just 25 cents.

834
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,039
- Hey, listen, guy.
He doesn't want it.
- I can handle this, Ramathorn.

835
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:37,159
- I don't want it!
- Right. Uh, beverage?

836
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:41,000
Gimme a, uh, liter of cola.

837
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:43,440
- A what?
- A liter of cola!

838
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:48,000
"Leederacola."
Do we make leederacola?

839
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,239
Will you just order
a large, Farva?

840
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,639
I don't want a large Farva.
I want a goddamn liter of cola!

841
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:56,719
- I don't know what that is!
- Liter is French...

842
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,599
for"give me some
fuckin' cola before I break
both fuckin' lips."

843
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:03,199
All right, all right.
Relax!

844
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,360
- That look like spit to you?
- Yeah.

845
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,480
- That look like spit to you?
- Yeah.

846
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,480
Ah, fuck it.

847
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,840
Mm. I feel like
a real cop again.

848
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,519
Well, I wouldn't get
used to it, 'cause you know
it's not gonna last.

849
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:23,000
- Bullshit.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
- All right, buddy.

850
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:25,079
We're about to get
shut down anyway.

851
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:28,599
Oh, yeah?
That's a lot of"Dimp."

852
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:31,840
- What do you do
if you get transferred?
- I don't know.

853
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,679
Bobbi doesn't want
to leave, and...

854
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,719
I don't want to leave
her and Arlo, so-

855
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,719
Yeah, I don't know
what the hell I'm gonna do.

856
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,840
Who gives a shit?
I'm about to win ten million
bucks anyway, right?

857
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,920
Are ya? What are you going to do
with that ten million bucks?

858
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,679
And you can't say,
"Buy the Cleveland Cavaliers."

859
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:48,239
- I'd buy a
ten-million-dollar car.
- Ah, good investment.

860
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,039
- But I'd pull you over.
- Bullshit. You could never catch me.

861
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:56,360
- Oh, I could never catch you?
- If you did, I'd activate my
car's wings, and fly away.

862
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,199
I got a good feelin' about this.

863
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,079
Damn it, you burger punk!

864
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,360
You son of a bitch!

865
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,079
- Aah!

866
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:23,559
Yeah, Burger Boy!

867
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,320
All right, all right, all right.

868
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,239
Cut it out, you guys.
Knock it off.

869
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:35,480
Clear out of here.
All of you.

870
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,719
I'm sorry about
the delousing, Rod.

871
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,599
Standard procedure.

872
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:54,599
- It's powdered sugar.
- The lice hate the sugar.

873
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,440
- Listen, Rod-
- It's delicious.

874
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:00,519
Uh, good. Good.

875
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:04,039
Say, Rod, what are your plans
after the shutdown?

876
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:07,480
We're not gettin' shut down,
Grady. We're drug busters.

877
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:11,199
Maybe they're drug busters,
but you're dispatch.

878
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,960
- Nuh-uh.
I'm back on the road, now.
- Until this little incident.

879
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Listen, Rod.

880
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,000
This whole murder thing,
we've been tryin' real hard
to break it open...

881
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,239
but O'Hagan just will not
cooperate with the evidence.

882
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,239
Now I've spoken to
the governor myself.

883
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,639
She is gonna shut
your station down, son.
It's gonna happen.

884
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:35,920
Now, I'm gonna have
a bigger budget then,
and I could really use...

885
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,079
a good local officer
like yourself.

886
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,159
- Could I go now?
- You could have your own car.

887
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,800
Work on exciting cases.
Hey, we could even chase
drug dealers together.

888
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,320
Now, the thing is, Rod...

889
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,199
I really need to know about
your side of the investigation.

890
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,920
O'Hagan's making all kinds
of threats, and-

891
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Can we make a deal?

892
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:04,159
I'm all highway.

893
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,800
Let him loose.

894
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,280
Sorry about that, bro.

895
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,599
Hey, Charlie's Angel.

896
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:47,840
- What's up?
- Guys.

897
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,039
Hey.

898
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:52,119
Well, we got about, uh,
twenty desk lamps.

899
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:56,639
- Farva went schizoid.
- That's good.

900
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,840
- How did
the undercover thing go?
- Well, not so good.

901
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,960
- Turns out, this guy
can't drive a semi.
- Yeah. 

902
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:05,360
You guys watch
that Johnny Chimpo thing?

903
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,639
- Funny, but nothin' there.
- Mm. Maybe you missed something.

904
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:13,480
Mm, trust me, bro.
There's nothing there.

905
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:16,400
Maybe we should
take another look.

906
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:51,440
- That's it, you're off
the road. Never again.
- Sir, no.

907
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,000
- It was not my fault.
- Neither was the goddamn
school bus.

908
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:57,119
You know, there was a time
we'd take a guy like you
out back and beat you.

909
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,440
- Now you got
your goddamn unions.
- I'm not a pro-union guy.

910
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,239
- And you're banned
from Dimpus Burger.
- Damn it!

911
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,599
Get some rubber gloves.
From now on,
you're my cleaning lady.

912
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,960
Beat it!

913
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,960
Well, the butler is basically
saying to Johannes Chimpo...

914
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,760
"Don't let the Great Satan tempt
you with the Western culture.

915
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,719
You must remain true
to the Taliban warlord."

916
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,360
- Cool beans.

917
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:35,599
So, um, Galikanokus
is not the butler?

918
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:40,000
Well, possibly. But this is,
uh, quite brilliant, really.

919
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:44,480
And so, Captain, you think
there might be some connection
with the smugglers?

920
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,880
Rabbit, get this meatball
out of here.

921
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,880
You got it, Captain.
Come on, meatball.

922
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,960
We should probably do that.

923
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:56,920
Back in the cage with
your beautiful wife, huh?

924
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,800
- What did you find out
at the weigh station?
- My cruiser weighs 16,000 kg.

925
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,239
I just got off the phone
with Tom McCardle from
the budget committee.

926
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,360
- This thing with Farva
screwed our pooch.
- What?

927
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,920
They can't lump us in
with that fuckin' Martian.

928
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:15,920
- We're all in the same boat.
- But our shenanigans are
cheeky and fun.

929
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,760
Yeah. His shenanigans
are cruel and tragic.

930
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,519
- Which makes them not
shenanigans at all, really.
- Evil shenanigans.

931
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,320
I swear to God
I'll pistol-whip the next guy
that says, "shenanigans."

932
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,639
Hey, Farva!

933
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:35,159
What's the name of that
restaurant you like, with
all the goofy shit on the walls...

934
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:38,559
- and the mozzarella sticks?
- You mean Shenanigans?

935
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:41,079
- No! Oh!
- You're talking about
Shenanigans, right?

936
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,599
Put those away!

937
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,119
- Hey, Rabbit.
- Yeah, I know. "You got
beautiful, big brown lips."

938
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:55,639
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

939
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:58,400
Have your fun, boys.
Have your fun.

940
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,559
'Cause I'm gonna start
looking for for a new job.

941
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:16,960
Hey! Urs! Ha!

942
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,960
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

943
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,079
- The mayor came down today.

944
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,920
Ah, biker! I'm an idiot.

945
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,039
Boy, you guys just keep
shooting yourselves in the foot.

946
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,480
- Heard you got to see Farva naked.
- Yeah, it was hard to miss.

947
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:42,280
So, Grady thinks he's
got you guys by the balls.

948
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,360
Yeah. How do you feel about
long-distance relationships?

949
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,360
Think I'm getting
sent to Deer Lick.

950
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,360
Well, I've been
thinking about this.

951
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,119
I think
I might have an idea.

952
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,360
The governor comes to town on
Saturday for that big thing, right?

953
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,000
She's gonna make a big speech
about drugs and law enforcement...

954
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:03,000
- and all of that
because of your bust.
- She's gonna shut us down.

955
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,679
No! Not if you give her more.

956
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,079
Get the reefer out of
the Winnebago and give it
to her during the party.

957
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:14,400
- Make a big show of it.
- With all that media there,
she would love us for it.

958
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,079
- No way she'll shut you down.
- That reefer's locked
in the Winnebago...

959
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:21,800
which is locked in your impound,
which is guarded by assholes.

960
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:27,400
All right.
Here's what I'll need.

961
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,159
Five ski masks, a case
of smoke bombs-the good ones-

962
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:33,480
- and banana peels, lots of banana-
- Foster?

963
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:37,679
- How about if I
just help you get in?
- You would do that for me?

964
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:41,159
Yeah. What the hell.
We'll work together.

965
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:43,760
- Like Cagney and Lacey.

966
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,760
Yeah. Well, Cagney
and Lacey were women.

967
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,440
- But-
- I could be Lacey.

968
01:05:57,679 --> 01:05:59,840
Mac-o!

969
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,679
- So that's it, huh?
- C.C.S. Rockman Bulletproofing
is the tops!

970
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,519
Same guys who make
our flak jackets.

971
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,239
Now, Rabbit,
a good cop does what...

972
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,679
before using his equipment
in the field?

973
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,039
- Uh, they test it?
- They test it. Exactly.

974
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,119
How are you shootin'
today, Thorn?

975
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:24,880
- Dead on all morning.
- How about
that little fella?

976
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,840
Oh, that little guy? I wouldn't
worry about that little guy.

977
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,239
- Good enough for me.
You're my man, now.

978
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,000
I don't get it.
How are we going to get
into the local impound?

979
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,039
There are gonna be cops there.

980
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,719
- Wa-hoo!

981
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,760
Most of the local cops
will probably already
be at the banquet.

982
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,119
They'll leave, like,
one or two of the dumbest
guys at the station.

983
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:53,400
- How are you feelin' there, Mac?
- Good
enough to fuck your mother!

984
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,320
So, what we have to do
is distract whoever
they leave there.

985
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,480
Hey, Mac! You still have
that Halloween costume?

986
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,760
Oh, hell, yeah.
You don't throw out-

987
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,719
Wa-hoo-hoo!

988
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,599
Damn, that's good!

989
01:07:07,639 --> 01:07:10,760
So, if we can get
ten minutes, you and I
can get into the impound...

990
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,360
get the reefer,
and get it to the governor
before she leaves?

991
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,360
- Nice and easy.
- I like it.

992
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:18,639
- You're up.
- Me?

993
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:20,639
- Now, don't get puke on it.
- Does it hurt?

994
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:22,760
You're gonna feel
a little pinch.

995
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,320
Lookin' good, Rabbit!
Now don't move!

996
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,880
- Hang on, buddy.
- Hey, Cap!

997
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,559
- Hey, Captain.
- Bulletproof cup, huh?

998
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:35,239
I invented this gag, Rabbit.

999
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,519
- Only in my day,
the rookie got naked.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1000
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,079
And we also used blanks.

1001
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:49,280
You're a sick motherfucker, Mac.

1002
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,760
- Thanks, Chief.
- All right, Thorny.
Why'd you call me up here?

1003
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:04,719
Good to know
you're still battin' for us with
the budget committee, Mayor.

1004
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,599
Well, I don't want
to mince words, John, but
it doesn't look too good.

1005
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:10,039
Maybe not to the untrained eye.

1006
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:14,400
But if I was a bettin' man,
I'd put money on us changin'
the governor's mind tonight.

1007
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,239
Well, you might want to
strap on your ass-kissing boots
and start right now.

1008
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,960
- I think she's your only hope.
- Hello.

1009
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:24,119
What is this thing again?
Humane Society?

1010
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:27,640
- Uh, it's a drug bust.
- Cocaine?

1011
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,079
- Hello.
- Uh, marijuana.

1012
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:35,319
- Then why are we here?
- Oh, I think we're pretty
well covered, Mr. Mayor.

1013
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:37,479
I think she's got
a lot of decisions to make.

1014
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,680
- I don't envy her.
- Oh, I do.

1015
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,960
I'll be lucky to have a figure
like that when I'm her age.

1016
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:45,600
- Yeah. That's a good one.

1017
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:51,319
- We're sending someone down,
don't worry. Okay.
- Thanks. You bet.

1018
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:54,159
- No, no, no, no.
We'll bring the guns.
- We're on it. We're on it.

1019
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:57,600
We got it. All right,
that's like twenty calls.

1020
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,079
I'll tell you what. I'll go down there
and check it out.

1021
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:03,560
- What about me?
- Burton, somebody's
got to stay here.

1022
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,640
All right, fuck it.

1023
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:28,119
Shit!

1024
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:30,119
Maybe this is the key.

1025
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,000
- I mean, no offense, bro, but...

1026
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,000
when did you become a cop?

1027
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:38,760
None taken, Ramathorn.
None taken.

1028
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,039
- Really. How'd you know
the key was there?
- A gentleman never asks.

1029
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:46,159
A lady never tells.
Wonder how Rabbit's doin'?

1030
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,680
- Oh, yeah!

1031
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,760
- Yeah! Yeah!
- What does that look like to you?

1032
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:57,680
- Is the bear-

1033
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:00,600
- Is the guy-
- Oh, yeah. Yeah!

1034
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,840
- Is the guy-
- Oh, yeah. Yeah!

1035
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,159
Seems more of
a game warden thing to me.

1036
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,279
- Well, it's illegal, Burton.
I know that!
- Whoo! Oh!

1037
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,199
Oh, shit. Look who's here.

1038
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:21,680
- I thought you said
he wasn't gonna make it.
- I tried.

1039
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,760
- Glad to see you, Rodney.
- Hey, how are you doin', Rowdy?

1040
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,640
- How you think I'm doin'?
Open bar, ain't it?
- Mm-hmm.

1041
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,199
- Thought you said Bowl-a-rama.
- Yeah, I tried to call you,
but, um-

1042
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:33,720
Yeah, right!

1043
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,800
- Give me six Schlitzes.
- No Schlitz.

1044
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,199
- Whatever's free.
- Take it easy, Rod.

1045
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:41,680
Open bar, dude!

1046
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:49,439
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1047
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,720
Hello down there.
Are you okay?

1048
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:02,359
Excuse me.

1049
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,760
- Bear-Bear-fucker!
- Yeah! Yeah!

1050
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,239
- Do you need assistance?
- Oh! Oh! Oh, yeah.

1051
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:14,720
Okay.

1052
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,720
Let's do this.

1053
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:22,039
Hey, hey, whoa! Whoa!

1054
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,239
Mayor Timber, yeah. So I just
wanted to let you know...

1055
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:30,720
that the governor's
gonna have to leave early.

1056
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,439
For an emergency fund-raiser.
So-

1057
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,800
Aw, she's gonna speak
in about five minutes.

1058
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,279
And then we're gonna
have to zip on out of here.

1059
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:41,079
- Well, thanks
for the heads-up.
- I'll go check on those guys.

1060
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,000
Mac-Attack!
Wanna go punch for punch?

1061
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:51,439
Good one!
I did not specify.

1062
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,119
Never shit a shitter. Lady in blue, comin' through.

1063
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,079
- Ramathorn.

1064
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:02,439
What? I don't know.
Two minutes?

1065
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,439
You weren't kiddin'.
That's a lot of hooch!

1066
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:03,319
Holy shit.
What's Grady doin' up there?

1067
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:07,439
...and of course, your own local
police chief, Bruce Grady...

1068
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,199
has made yet another
astonishing breakthrough...

1069
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:15,199
in our state's War on Drugs.

1070
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:19,279
- That's fine police work.

1071
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,000
Thank you very much.
The real credit...

1072
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,000
goes to my skilled officers,
who uncovered the marijuana
in that Winnebago.

1073
01:13:26,039 --> 01:13:30,159
And, uh, we have
identified the dead woman
from that Winnebago...

1074
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:35,359
as a drug "queenpin"
from Louisville, Kentucky-
Lucy Garfield.

1075
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:40,399
Or, as we like to call her
down at the station,
"The Louisville Smuggler."

1076
01:13:43,079 --> 01:13:45,359
There will be no more
running of marijuana...

1077
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:47,359
through Spurbury
on my watch.

1078
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:49,880
- You can count on that.

1079
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,479
Farva's number one!
Farva's number one!

1080
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,560
Hey! You showed Grady
our secret stash?
That was our stash!

1081
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,520
- I did not show Grady the stash!
- Those bags of grass...

1082
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,359
- represented a-a bond
of trust between us.
- Foster-

1083
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:14,119
- Foster, I had no idea-
- Did you pick me because
you could manipulate me?

1084
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:17,399
No! How could you
even say that?

1085
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:20,560
- Because you crapped
on my heart!
- I what on your heart?

1086
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,920
What are you gettin'
out of this? Is Grady
puttin' you on the road?

1087
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,359
No, a-are you-
You're screwing him too.

1088
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:30,520
- Asshole.
- Aah!

1089
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,279
- Ursula-

1090
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:45,920
- Oh, Mac.
- What the fuck?

1091
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,880
Fuckin' traitor!

1092
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,920
Hey, Mac! Did it work?
Did it work?

1093
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,119
Was there ever a moment
when you suspected her?

1094
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,439
- No, why would I?
- Exactly.

1095
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:09,399
Why use your head when
you can be getting some
cop-on-cop fucky-sucky?

1096
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,800
Well, did you
tell her anything?

1097
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,800
Two cops sleeping together.
What the hell do you think
they talked about?

1098
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,680
I don't know. Doin' it?
Positions and stuff?

1099
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,960
Oh, shut up.
You guys don't even know her.

1100
01:15:18,039 --> 01:15:20,239
- Get it through your head,
fish dick. She was in on it.
- Fuck you, Mac!

1101
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:23,279
All right, all right.
Fighting's not gonna
change anything.

1102
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:26,840
Foster, she played you good.
It's called the honey pot.
You should have known better.

1103
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,960
Well, I guess they're gonna
shut us down anyway.

1104
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:34,680
But you two are friends,
you know? You shouldn't
let this come between you.

1105
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,960
Come on now.
Shake hands.

1106
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,960
- Sorry.
- You should be.

1107
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,159
- Hey!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1108
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:46,359
- Good, now.
Who wants a shot?
- I do.

1109
01:15:46,439 --> 01:15:48,720
- I'll have one.
- I said, who wants a shot?

1110
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,800
- I do!
- Do you have any openings
in Sherburne, Cap?

1111
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,479
- Not for you guys.
- Oh, come on.

1112
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,520
- We're like the sons you never had.
- If you were my son, Mac...

1113
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,520
I would have
smothered you by now.

1114
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:03,119
Smothered me in gravy,
you big, dirty man.

1115
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,239
- You put in for a transfer yet?
- Ugh!

1116
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:08,520
I applied for a guard job.
At the post office.

1117
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,239
- Oh, man.
- You'll finally get
to shoot someone.

1118
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,359
- To the death of fun.
- Here's to you guys.

1119
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:28,479
What's up, dirty dogs?

1120
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,159
Guess that's it for
the old locker.

1121
01:16:32,199 --> 01:16:34,680
She stinks like ass,
but I'll sure miss her.

1122
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,760
I guess you can say that
about all my girls.

1123
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:40,520
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck to you too.

1124
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,680
- What are you?
- I'm a cop. What are you?

1125
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,720
- A local cop?
- Grady had an opening. Big deal.

1126
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,600
Why are you wearing that
uniform in my station?

1127
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,880
Look who's talkin', Denim Dan!

1128
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,720
You look like the president,
chairman and C.E.O.
of Levi Strauss.

1129
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,880
Where'd you get
the Canadian tuxedo?

1130
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,239
You ratted us out to Grady.

1131
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:05,359
I'm not even gonna dignify
myself with a response to that.

1132
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:08,520
Hey, I got no hard feelings.
Nothin' a few beers
can't fix, right?

1133
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,079
Hey, how about
one on me, Ramrod?

1134
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,359
Excuse me.
Uh, excuse me, guys.

1135
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,760
Yeah. I'll be right back.

1136
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:23,079
- What the fuck?
- We should have taken him
out the back and shot him.

1137
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:25,720
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- I gotta call Ursula.

1138
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,239
Fellas, we got to get him back.
He's gotta pay for this.

1139
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:30,760
- Nobody wears that uniform
in my station.

1140
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,600
- Farva's goin' down!
- Yes! Right!

1141
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,079
- Grady's goin' down!
- Yeah!

1142
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,600
- All of these fuckers
are goin' down!
- Yeah!

1143
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:42,800
- What?

1144
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,399
Welcome to Dimpus Burger.
May I take your order?

1145
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:03,840
Hello in there.
This is Officer Rod Farva.

1146
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,520
- Give me a liter of cola!
- Uh, sorry, Officer Farva, I can't-

1147
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,119
You want me to come in there, boy?
I'll come in there!

1148
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,960
- Hello?
- Chase him! Chase him!

1149
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:16,479
- Let's pull someone over.

1150
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,479
Whoa!

1151
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,600
License and registration.

1152
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,159
When you gotta go,
you gotta go.

1153
01:18:47,479 --> 01:18:51,159
We are the Spurbury police!

1154
01:18:53,239 --> 01:18:55,680
Whoo! Hoo!
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

1155
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,279
- Whoo!

1156
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:08,680
I'm cool. I'm cool.

1157
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,680
Grady! Get your ass out here!

1158
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:22,079
- Grady!
- I don't want to sound
like a wienie...

1159
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,239
- but I think I should call Ursula.
- No way!

1160
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:27,439
- You sound like a fuckin' wienie.
- Gimme the radio.

1161
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,680
Grady? Bruce?

1162
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,840
Fuck it, all right.
Gimme the goddamn radio.

1163
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,199
- He's not home!
- Hey, Chief-o!

1164
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:38,159
This is Officer Rod Farva.
Come in, Ursula.

1165
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:41,159
- What're you doin'?
- Ursula! I love you, Ursula.

1166
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:44,079
- Come in, Ursula!
- Who is this? Hello?

1167
01:19:44,199 --> 01:19:46,439
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, she's there?

1168
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,439
Ursula! Oh, I'm sorry.

1169
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,600
Sir, this is a police channel.
Please get off of it.

1170
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:56,119
- I'm tryin' to apologize here.
- Sir, this is not a civilian channel.

1171
01:19:56,199 --> 01:19:59,560
If you'd like to have
a conversation with someone,
please go to Channel Five.

1172
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,680
All right, Thorny.
Pop it over to Channel Five.

1173
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,960
Look what I found!
A two-by-four!

1174
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:07,880
- You go, girl!
- Foster!

1175
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,840
- Help me out here, Rabbit.
- Foster, is that you?

1176
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,760
-I need someone sober.
- You got it, Cap.

1177
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,600
- And, hit!
- My ass in your face, Thorny.

1178
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,520
- So-So, hey, what's goin' on?

1179
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,000
Don't use that
boyfriend voice with me.
What are you doing?

1180
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:25,319
Don't use that boyfriend
voice with me, Foster!

1181
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:27,560
- Hit!
- Yea!

1182
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,560
Now, did you know that Farva
was the one who told Grady
about our plans?

1183
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:37,680
- Yeah. I know.
He's working for us now.
- So, I'm sorry.

1184
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,199
- I don't know.
Can I come see you?
- I love you.

1185
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:46,119
- Listen, Foster-
- Ursula! I'm naked! 

1186
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:50,239
- Listen, Foster? You want
to get these guys back?

1187
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:54,279
- Yeah!
- I know a way we can
get 'em really good.

1188
01:20:54,359 --> 01:20:57,760
- Yeah, let's get 'em good!
Did you hear that, guys?
- Yes, sir.

1189
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,119
- Okay, I get off work at 10:30.

1190
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,560
Meet me at Route 9
and Okeechobee Road,
and don't be late.

1191
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,760
- She said, "Okeechobee."
- She's okey-dokey.

1192
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,760
She's late.

1193
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:17,399
So, Foster...

1194
01:21:17,479 --> 01:21:21,680
- is this your
usual meeting spot?
- No.

1195
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:26,479
- Fuckin' shit!
- That was Galikanokus!

1196
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,439
- Let's get him!

1197
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:38,479
Outta the car!
Goddamn it!

1198
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,119
Same shit, different day,
huh, Rabbit?

1199
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:44,159
Everybody outta the car!
I said now!

1200
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:47,479
You're all under arrest
for stealing a Spurbury
police vehicle.

1201
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,560
No, Farva, you are under
arrest for being a total
and complete fuckhead!

1202
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,880
Y-You don't want to do
this, Rod. We gotta go
catch that truck.

1203
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,560
Using what?
Super Citizen power?

1204
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,439
Galikanokus is on that truck!

1205
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:03,239
I'll believe that when
me shit turns purple...

1206
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:06,760
- and smells like rainbow sherbet.
- Does it sound like that when I say it?

1207
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,720
Farva! You are not stopping me
from getting my job back!

1208
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,079
- Get him, Mac!

1209
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:16,840
- I got a job now.
- You're a local cop.

1210
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,319
- You're goddamn right I am!
- You ratted us out!

1211
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:23,560
No, Thorny.
I barely had a job before.

1212
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,359
Farva, get the coffee.
Farva, hit the radio.

1213
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,319
Farva, clean the cells!
I'm a cop, goddamn it!

1214
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:34,359
I got my own car, now.
I get to bust criminals!

1215
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:36,880
It's what I gotta do!

1216
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,039
- You screwed us over.
- No, Thorny.

1217
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:45,079
Okay. Okay, I did!
I did, I did.

1218
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:46,840
- I'm sorry, Rodney.
- Come on, Rod.

1219
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,880
- Oh, Thorny!
- No, no, no. Please. Come on.

1220
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,560
- Listen, listen.
This is your big chance.

1221
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:57,159
When we go up there,
and we're wrong, no big deal.

1222
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:01,640
But if we're right,
you can be a hero.

1223
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,920
Come on. Team Ramrod!

1224
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:11,319
Will you look at that?

1225
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:14,560
- We got 'em, Cap.
- We got 'em, we got 'em!

1226
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:19,079
- Oh.
- Fuckin' Galikanokus!

1227
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:21,199
There's Canadian
markings on that plane.

1228
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:25,000
Okay, Foster.
You and Rabbit come around
in a classic pincer move.

1229
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:28,119
- Mac, I need you to take-
- No, no, no, Thorny. Me and you!

1230
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:31,439
We outflank 'em, and we do,
like, a submarine move.

1231
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:34,000
- Team Ramrod?
- Shut up, Farva.

1232
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:36,479
- Farva, you're leaning-
- Wait a minute!

1233
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,319
Oh! The locals!
I hate those fuckin' guys!

1234
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:44,760
Goddamn it, you dipshits!
If I had my car, I'd have
been in on this bust!

1235
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,640
Shh! Rodney! Rodney,
get your ass back here!

1236
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:52,359
Here we go again-
What the fuck?

1237
01:23:52,439 --> 01:23:56,319
- Oh, did you see that?
He kissed that guy!
- Shh!

1238
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:00,560
Holy shit!

1239
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,399
God! We should have known.

1240
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:08,119
So, wait. The local cops are selling
Afghani grass to the Canadians?

1241
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,640
-Assholes!
- No, Rabbit,
it's comin' in from Canada.

1242
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,479
Canadian grass. Ah!

1243
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,680
-Assholes.
- No!

1244
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,920
The local mothers are
running protection for' em.

1245
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,159
- Oh, I guess I'm the asshole.

1246
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:25,840
- I'm sorry we didn't
wait for you, but-

1247
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,920
Listen to me, Foster.
I need to tell you something.

1248
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,439
- What, are you guys drunk?
- No!

1249
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,439
- Your local buddies are runnin' grass!
- Listen, I know.

1250
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,920
- I know what they're doing.
I've known for awhile.
- You know this?

1251
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,119
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you in on it?

1252
01:24:42,199 --> 01:24:46,560
No! They keep me on dispatch.
I didn't know what to do
when I found out about it.

1253
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,399
- I was afraid I'd lose my job.
- Oh.

1254
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:51,479
You should have just told us.
We would have arrested them.

1255
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,520
- Yeah, we used to be cops,
remember? Shh!
- I remember-

1256
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,880
No offense,
but the less you guys knew,
the less you could screw up.

1257
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:01,359
- Oh.
- I was trying to stop it
without getting brought down.

1258
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:04,640
Th-That's why I helped you find
the reefer, that's why I helped
you guys steal the Winnebago...

1259
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,319
and that's why
I brought you...here tonight.

1260
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:10,439
- Ah!
- You didn't do this because
you like Foster? Shh!

1261
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,760
No, I mean-
I do like Foster, but I-

1262
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,600
- But you used him.
- Yeah, I guess so.
But I really like him now.

1263
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,720
Ah!

1264
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,279
- This is so good-
- This is kind of awkward.

1265
01:25:22,359 --> 01:25:28,039
I hate to break up the "like-fest,"
but it's prime time for crime-time!

1266
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:31,319
But wait! Hey, hey, hey!
Are you guys kidding?
Look at yourselves.

1267
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:34,079
You saw what they did to
Galikanokus's girlfriend.

1268
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:35,800
And you guys are drunk,
and unarmed.

1269
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,159
- Oh, hey,
I am sober as a bird.

1270
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:42,079
I am drunk.

1271
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,920
- What do you got?
- No guns. They got flares.

1272
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:54,000
And some string.

1273
01:26:00,199 --> 01:26:03,600
Oh, Farva,
you sad, lonely man.

1274
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,039
- Ugh.
- Oh, wait. He's got
your name written on it.

1275
01:26:08,119 --> 01:26:10,039
- Oh!
- Ooh.

1276
01:26:10,119 --> 01:26:14,680
- Chief!. Chief Grady!
I secured the perimeter, sir.
- Farva!

1277
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,520
Sorry I missed the call.
Looks like we got 'em. Rock'n' roll!

1278
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,439
What the hell are
you doin' here, Farva?
Put that pistol down!

1279
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,239
- Qu'est-ce-que c'est ca?
- English!

1280
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,880
- Chief!.
- Put a bullet in him, Grady.

1281
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,680
- What the fuck is this?

1282
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,479
- Grady?
- Shit, what the fuck is this?

1283
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,840
- Shoot it!

1284
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,239
- That's my car.
- Grady!

1285
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:49,720
- That's my girl!
- Grady!

1286
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,840
Smy, Burton, check that out.

1287
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:02,560
- What are ya, drunk?
- Drunk enough to kick your ass.

1288
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,399
Let's see what
you've got, O'Hagan.

1289
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,159
Two-time Navy champion.
Tag 'im and bag 'im!

1290
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,920
- Way to go, Cap.
- Give my regards to Bobby Baboon.

1291
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,119
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You haven't opened it yet, have ya?

1292
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:08,279
- How are ya doin'?
- Hey, man. Hey, buddy.

1293
01:28:08,359 --> 01:28:10,640
- Hi.
- Hey!

1294
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,760
- Hi, John.
- Hi, darlin'.

1295
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,520
Here we go.

1296
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,920
"Dear John...

1297
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,479
"Congratulations
are due to you...

1298
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:25,479
"and your men
for your brave, impressive...

1299
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,600
"but most of all
unorthodox tactics...

1300
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,720
"in thwarting
the drug-smuggling ring...

1301
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,920
and extreme
police corruption."

1302
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,920
- Ooh. She loves us.
- All right.

1303
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,760
"I cannot stress enough how proud
we at the statehouse are of you.

1304
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,640
"The great state of Vermont could
use more officers like your men.

1305
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:47,680
"As you requested, we have
reevaluated the financial situation...

1306
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,600
regarding your unit."

1307
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,720
- And we're gonna
buy you a tank.

1308
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:56,119
"Due to our tight fiscal situation...

1309
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:59,119
"we regret to inform you
that we are still...

1310
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,119
"going to have to close
your station.

1311
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,159
"Good luck in Sherburne, John.

1312
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:09,840
"And give your men my best.

1313
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,840
"Sincerely...

1314
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,239
Governor Fuckhead."

1315
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,800
I did not see that coming.

1316
01:29:44,119 --> 01:29:47,479
- I told you
to bring the handcart.

1317
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:51,279
- Sorry.
- Tilt it.

1318
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:54,640
Oh, goddamn, I remember
these things being lighter!

1319
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,119
I think I'm gonna drop a nut!

1320
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:59,800
- Shit.
- Hope they like foam.

1321
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,000
- It's not so bad. Good exercise.

1322
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:06,319
- Cool uniforms.
- Yeah. All the beer you can drink.

1323
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,159
- I'm into that!

1324
01:30:12,279 --> 01:30:15,079
Beer!

1325
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:18,800
- Oh, God.
- You order the keg of St. Anky?

1326
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,239
Uh, yeah!

1327
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:24,039
But aren't you guys
the Highway Patrol?

1328
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:26,479
Yeah, but our station
got shut down, so-

1329
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,319
Oh, no shit, man!

1330
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:31,520
Yeah, shit.
This your keg?

1331
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,640
Oh, my-my Dad ordered it.
But he's asleep right now.

1332
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,880
Keg's here! 

1333
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:43,159
Oh, St. Anky's.

1334
01:30:43,239 --> 01:30:45,439
- Oh, God. No!
- No, no, no!

1335
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:48,359
Hey, man. Hey, bro.
It's cool, man. They got fired!

1336
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,840
No shit?

1337
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,960
No shit, man!

1338
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:58,720
- All right, all right.
Where's the keg go?
- Put it in the rec room, man.

1339
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:04,199
Make room, make room.
What took you guys
so long to get here?

1340
01:31:04,279 --> 01:31:06,279
What'd you do?
Brew it yourself?

1341
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:08,960
- I am cool.
- You're cool, man.

1342
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:13,079
Check this out.
Um, why don't you guys
put that, um...

1343
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:15,079
over there?

1344
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:20,319
- Move it, move it, move it.
- We want a drink! Come on.

1345
01:31:20,359 --> 01:31:23,000
Tap this thing!

1346
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:26,239
Actually, you know what?
I think it's better...

1347
01:31:26,359 --> 01:31:29,079
Feng Shui if it's, uh,
over there.

1348
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:31,600
Definitely. Definitely
better over there.

1349
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,239
Oh, wait, wait. Guys. Guys.
You know what?

1350
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:43,720
Man, it's probably
better for the flow...

1351
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,079
if you put it back over here.

1352
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,239
And don't forget
to tap that keg, guys.

1353
01:31:55,119 --> 01:31:57,399
Okay, okay. Somebody's
gonna need to sign for this...

1354
01:31:57,479 --> 01:31:59,399
and I need to see some I.D.

1355
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:04,800
Look, you know what?
I don't have any I.D.

1356
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,239
But, uh, Abraham Lincoln
here, he says that I'm 21...

1357
01:32:09,319 --> 01:32:11,279
and he never told a lie.

1358
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:16,439
Yeah, actually it was
George Washington that
never told a lie.

1359
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,239
You guys drive
a hard bargain, but-

1360
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:22,119
Actually, you know what?

1361
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:25,239
Why don't you guys split it?

1362
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:28,479
That was good, man.

1363
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,520
- Are you ready
for the fun part?
- Oh, yeah.

1364
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,720
'Cause here comes
the fun part: Spurbury Police!

1365
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,760
- You're all under arrest!

1366
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,279
- Come on back, now.
- Oh, yeah.

1367
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,920
All this for a noise complaint?

1368
01:32:57,079 --> 01:33:02,680
- I love acid-

1369
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,359
Cops.

1370
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,479
What the crap?
How come nobody called me?

1371
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:15,079
- We're in trouble, aren't we?
- Oh, yeah.
You're in big trouble.

1372
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:15,840
- We're in trouble, aren't we?
- Oh, yeah.
You're in big trouble.

1373
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:24,520
And if you really want to
choke somebody, you gotta
hit the Adam's apple.

1374
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,640
- Like this?

1375
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:02,520
- Loser!

1376
01:34:18,279 --> 01:34:21,680
- Ping! Ping!

1377
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,720
Ping! Ping!

1378
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:27,840
Ping!

1379
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,960
Farva!

1380
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Get out of the car.

1381
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,319
That's right.

1382
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:11,680
I'm talkin' to you.

1383
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,520
Aah!

1384
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:06,560
- Ah-ha-ha-ha!- I think we got it.
