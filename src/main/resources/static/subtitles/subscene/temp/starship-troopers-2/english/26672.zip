1
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:55,964
Our war is going better than ever.

2
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,600
But we need heroes! We need you.

3
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,406
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

4
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:09,404
Service guarantees citizenship.
Would you like to know more?

5
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,559
The sky marshal launches
Operation March to Victory.

6
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:16,482
A bold, new strategy
calling for total war...

7
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:20,278
...against the Bug, on every front.

8
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:34,049
Would you like to know more?

9
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:45,399
Look out! Look out!

10
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:49,522
Fall back!

11
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:53,045
Retreat! Retreat!

12
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,927
- We need pickup now!
- Yes, sir!

13
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:59,367
Sir, this is Mobile Infantry Bravo 6
to Fleet Rescue.

14
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:02,760
It's Bravo 6 to Fleet Rescue.

15
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,443
Fall back!

16
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,007
Retreat!

17
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,326
Horton, Sandee, pull back!

18
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,599
Help me with this, goddamn it!

19
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,797
You're okay, Sandee. I got you.

20
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,528
- You're okay!
- Hold what you've got!

21
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:41,564
- Come on, Bug!
- Tor!

22
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,606
Cover our 6!

23
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:46,078
Oh, that 6.

24
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,967
Hey, Bug!

25
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,243
Do you copy? Do you copy?

26
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:54,326
Brick! Cover Tor!

27
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:57,401
- Tor.
- Come and get some from Tor, baby!

28
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,360
Otter!

29
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:10,838
Fight or die, soldier!

30
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:13,526
- Private Sahara!
- Yes, sergeant?

31
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,761
Private Otter is a dead man.
If he won't fight, shoot him!

32
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:18,760
Sir!

33
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:22,808
Just pull the trigger, Billie!
It's not enough, but it'll have to do.

34
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,728
- Fleet Rescue to Bravo 6.
- Go ahead, Fleet Rescue.

35
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,325
Fleet Rescue to Bravo 6,
rescue priority is no-go, MI.

36
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,243
Colt-Victor-one-niner is negative
for pickup!

37
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,719
Hold the perimeter!
Hold that line!

38
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,800
- Hold the line!
- I don't want excuses!

39
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,561
I want a crossfire!

40
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,289
Get in and plug that hole.
Plug that hole!

41
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,566
- General, Fleet's no-go for pickup.
- We gotta make a move.

42
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:49,038
- Hold the line!
- Bugs have got Coy!

43
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,918
This is General Shepherd.
You jackass! We need pickup!

44
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,725
Bravo 6 to Fleet Rescue,
do you copy?

45
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:02,285
General, getting a vision.
It isn't clear.

46
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,162
They're building up.
They're all around us.

47
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:08,964
Lieutenant, you're the psychic!
Tell me something I don't know!

48
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,808
It's something massive.
It'll take us all out.

49
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:15,439
- I can't get it all, but...
- General! There's an outpost.

50
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:18,362
Hotel Delta 185,
abandoned eight days ago!

51
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,008
Half a klick that way.

52
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,724
- Middle of Satan's Anvil?
- Bugs own that real estate, general.

53
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,521
There's no cover on the Anvil.

54
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,879
We're gonna have a rough ride,
lieutenant!

55
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:29,323
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:31,605
You, you, you, and you, stay here.

57
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:33,521
Everybody else move out!

58
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:36,318
Request permission to remain
with the general.

59
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,002
- That's negative, Rake.
- Sir?

60
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,763
- Lieutenant Dill will assume command.
- Yes, sir!

61
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,648
He's the psychic.
You're the war fighter!

62
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:46,489
Move them out, sergeant!
Give them hell!

63
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:49,761
Yes, sir!
Prepare to withdraw.

64
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,760
Withdraw!

65
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:55,359
- Let's go, move it, move it, move it!
- Come on, Billie.

66
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,565
Keep going!

67
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,198
Let's go!

68
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,525
Follow me!

69
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,683
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

70
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:24,728
- Get out!
- Go, go, go! Come on!

71
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,206
Let's go!

72
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:31,325
Let's go!

73
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:32,763
Move it!

74
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,965
Move it, move it, move it!

75
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,002
Where's my frigging outpost, corporal?

76
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,718
It's here. We're here...

77
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:21,198
About time, corporal.
That soup's gonna boil!

78
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,247
- Move out!
- Let's go! Come on, come on!

79
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:26,604
- Let's go! Come on, suck it up!
- Hurry up!

80
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,647
Move, move, move!

81
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:34,123
- Take cover!
- Let's get out of here!

82
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,243
Move it, Otter!
Come on, move it.

83
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,043
Come on! Hurry up.

84
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:45,881
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go.

85
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:48,199
Come on.

86
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,088
- Get down!
- Over there!

87
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,046
- Hurry up.
- Grab that door.

88
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,562
Bill, help me, help me...

89
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,558
Come on, Billie, come on!

90
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:21,043
Take my hand!

91
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:22,927
Come on! Stay down.

92
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:24,403
No!

93
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,724
- Come on!
- It's okay. I got you.

94
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,999
Otter, Kobe, get down!

95
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,843
Keep going.
Come on.

96
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,643
- Keep moving. Keep moving.
- Come on.

97
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,727
- Go.
- Kobe, look out!

98
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:01,847
Tor! Brick!

99
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,284
With me! Move!

100
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,448
Tor, Horton! Get Kobe inside!

101
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,646
- Brick, with me. Go!
- Come on!

102
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,198
Stay with me, buddy!

103
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,327
Sandee! Move on!

104
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:27,639
Here we go.
You're all right, you're all right.

105
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:52,527
Brick! You and Sandee...

106
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:56,238
...take a squad, set a perimeter.
Sahara? Get that door closed.

107
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,603
Sir!

108
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,919
Make a hole!

109
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:04,118
- Make it wide!
- Sahara! Out of the way!

110
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:08,204
- Coming through.
- Get out of the way!

111
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,041
Right, easy. Take it easy.

112
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,040
Watch his back.

113
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,926
Get his pack off!
Horton, cut that radio off!

114
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:19,886
Get that off him.

115
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,688
Take it easy.

116
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:26,000
You're all right.
Where are those meds?

117
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:56,601
Where are those meds?
Damn it!

118
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,765
- Sergeant?
- It's fine.

119
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,841
- Sergeant!
- Just take it easy. Take it easy.

120
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:14,842
I want someone on that com,
and I want pickup.

121
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,159
Yes, sir, wouldn't we all?

122
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,404
- That's a direct order, sergeant.
- No-go on the door, sarge.

123
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:25,998
Stay down. Relax, buddy.
You gotta relax.

124
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:28,763
Why can't you do anything
for this man, Tor?

125
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:31,963
Private!

126
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,927
Get on that com.
I want pickup now!

127
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,523
- What are you looking at, private?
- Sir, com don't run without power.

128
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:43,648
Well, at OCS, you learn that a sergeant
is the solution to any problem.

129
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,527
So you get the power up.

130
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:48,681
They say what kind of boat
Fleet lands in a shit-storm?

131
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,522
I am giving the orders!
You will take them!

132
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:55,159
I want the goddamn power!
And I want it now!

133
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,680
I am waiting, sergeant.

134
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:33,238
Horton, Otter, Sahara, with me.

135
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,285
Shit. Sir?

136
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,766
Might want to see this.

137
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,849
Radio's nonoperational.

138
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:02,965
Coming, lieutenant?

139
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,006
Looks like Colonel Hohlback
left in a hurry.

140
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:25,085
What the hell is that?

141
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:27,400
I'd say we've got company.

142
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:34,198
Horton! You and Otter locate
the reactors and fire them up.

143
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,803
What is that?

144
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,599
Outpost incinerator.

145
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,920
Move away from the door!

146
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,001
Why are you still here, soldier?

147
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,602
Probably because no
one lit the furnace.

148
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,521
Captain V.J. Dax.

149
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,680
Says here he's a big hero.

150
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:30,400
Combat medals, Bronze Stars, Purple
Heart, Purple Heart, Purple Heart.

151
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,685
Federal Medal of Valour
at Widowmakers.

152
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:34,077
That's a lot of crap.

153
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,525
Wounded four times, refused numerous
battlefield commissions...

154
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,566
Give me that.

155
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:32,246
- Some hero.
- You murdered Colonel Hohlback?

156
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:35,479
He had his Morita and a sidearm.

157
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,798
I just used my hands.

158
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:41,925
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

159
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,842
He's a mad dog.
He stays in the cage.

160
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,684
Just remember, lieutenant,
every dog has its day!

161
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,317
Sarge! Hostiles!

162
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,445
I am in command here, private.

163
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:57,405
Now, how many and
what's our situation?

164
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:00,561
- Looks like a whole damn circus.
- Let's go.

165
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:08,128
Trooper!

166
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,562
Shelter!
Right perimeter, spread wide!

167
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:37,482
You three, follow me.

168
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:42,561
- He's spreading us too thin!
- You know something I don't, trooper?

169
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:58,487
They're shifting their lines!

170
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,519
You, take the left!
Take the middle! Take the right!

171
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,009
Sandee! Report!

172
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:14,205
Nothing! No movement!

173
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,563
Come on, you bastards!
What are you waiting for?

174
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:18,957
Shut up, fathead!

175
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:22,280
- You starting with me?
- Just like covering your 6, huh?

176
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,885
Prepare to fire!

177
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,407
Otter, get up!

178
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,323
Fire! Fire! Fire!

179
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:03,398
Come on! Bug!

180
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:37,520
Son of a bitch!

181
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:39,680
Pull back!

182
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:41,999
Come on, go, go!
I got you covered!

183
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:45,320
Billie. It's okay. It's okay!

184
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,799
Go, go, go, go!

185
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:01,919
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

186
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:08,488
Give me your hand.

187
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,288
- What?
- Give me your hand.

188
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:20,642
Look out!

189
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:28,288
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Don't let go!

190
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,925
No!

191
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:37,004
Pull back your line, lieutenant!

192
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,400
Weapon!

193
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:10,887
Let's go.

194
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,161
Bug!

195
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,682
Get down!
Move!

196
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:42,087
- All right, people, listen up!
- Who the hell let you out?

197
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:46,037
- In about 15 seconds...
- All right, you son of a bitch...

198
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:51,805
Shield your eyes at count zero!

199
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:53,322
Pass the word!

200
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:56,128
Get off your ass,
there's a war going on.

201
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,519
You two! With me on flank!

202
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,602
Perimeter burn in 10 seconds.

203
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:08,766
Perimeter burn in 10 seconds.

204
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:10,728
Look out!

205
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,043
Come on!

206
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:26,560
Three.

207
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:28,799
Two.

208
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:31,039
One.

209
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:32,767
Zero.

210
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:38,049
Perimeter burn.

211
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:25,002
I need two volunteers.

212
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:31,684
- Who do you think you are?
- The big stick that's running this show.

213
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:34,401
- I'll go.
- Me too.

214
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:38,642
If we're not back inside of five minutes,
it means more Bugs are on the way.

215
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,118
You mean we didn't kill them all?

216
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:43,405
You never kill them all, son.

217
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:15,044
All right, who's got...?

218
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,408
A light.

219
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:22,281
Otter, take a knee.

220
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:26,366
- You see those busted wires there?
- Yes, sir.

221
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,248
You got the wiggle room, kid.
Splice them together.

222
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,286
Trooper, hand me that...

223
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,045
Where's your knife?

224
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,245
I must have lost it, sir.

225
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:44,926
Anyone who loses his knife in my unit
would be strung up for lashes, kid.

226
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:59,079
You want to be careful
with the red wire.

227
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,527
We got movement!

228
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,884
Horton, illumination round.

229
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:15,401
Hold your fire, we're coming through!

230
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:17,208
It's the general.

231
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:19,325
I see him!
He's bringing home two.

232
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:22,648
He's bringing home three.

233
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,562
Wonder who didn't make it.
Hope it wasn't Goldy.

234
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:29,438
He was nice to me on my first day.
It's those little things that count.

235
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,725
Yeah, like doing your goddamn job.

236
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,483
Hostiles! Right on your general's ass!

237
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:36,526
Come on, kid!

238
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:23,887
Outstanding.

239
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:27,280
- That stinks!
- You get so you like it after a while.

240
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:30,759
- Son, I'll never forget it.
- Me neither, sir.

241
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:35,048
What kind of a-hole do you think I am?
Put her there!

242
00:25:35,209 --> 00:25:36,801
Welcome back, sir.

243
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,961
I don't know who you are,
but you're aces with me.

244
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:44,604
It's nothing personal, general.
I'm just doing my job.

245
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:47,841
Hey, fellas, let me give you a hand.

246
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:54,087
Hell, I got a dog back home
weighs more than she does.

247
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,644
Well, look what the cat drug in!

248
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:11,804
You should see that damn cat!
We're in the shitter, huh?

249
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:14,039
- We got a chance.
- Good to see you.

250
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,200
Want the bad news or the bad news?

251
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,279
- I almost forgot your knife.
- Keep it, kid.

252
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,839
- No, I couldn't.
- Trooper needs a knife.

253
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:24,079
Officers just tell troopers
where to die.

254
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:29,641
- That's not really true, is it, sir?
- Watch out for officers, son.

255
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:31,606
It's their job to get you killed.

256
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:41,679
First wave came in,
and Deke and Slater were killed.

257
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:47,561
Came in again and that...
That kid Goldy was gone.

258
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:51,487
And then it was just...

259
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:54,683
...me and O'Hara.

260
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:58,046
That magnificent son of a bitch.

261
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:01,124
We held them.

262
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,487
I tell you, this...

263
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:10,964
...star don't mean a hill of beans when
you're caught between shit and sweat.

264
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,405
And then these two beautiful
bastards show up.

265
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:18,881
These two here, and they're carrying
a couple of grenades...

266
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,643
...and they got a boatload of gumption.

267
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,720
And they saved my sorry ass!

268
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:26,279
And I'd like to introduce you to them.

269
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:29,327
This is Corporal Joe Griff,
Medical Corps.

270
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:32,049
And this is Technical
Sergeant Ari Peck.

271
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:35,645
And I can't tell you a thing about
Sleeping Beauty over here...

272
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:39,848
...because she snored through
the whole damn thing.

273
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,806
That's Private Soda, sir.

274
00:27:41,969 --> 00:27:44,529
She didn't sleep after our
unit got chopped down.

275
00:27:44,689 --> 00:27:48,477
Found Peck the next day,
what, about five days ago?

276
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:52,688
Everybody's gotta sleep sometime.

277
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:55,087
What's your story, Peck?

278
00:27:55,249 --> 00:28:00,482
32nd Tech Brigade,
sole survivor, sir!

279
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:01,968
That's me.

280
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:06,081
Been out there about a month,
near as I can tell.

281
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:08,808
That's a long time.

282
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:12,006
Pretty long, yeah. I guess.

283
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:15,206
Well, then, we got to get you home.

284
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:17,921
Lieutenant Dill.

285
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,842
- Yes, sir!
- Has pickup been arranged?

286
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:35,519
- Sergeant Peck, can I talk to you?
- Yes, sir?

287
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:39,602
You think you can make this com talk
and squawk like it ought to?

288
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:46,163
Well, you can bet I'll die trying, sir.

289
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:52,367
- Get some sleep and try later.
- Oh, no, no. I'll get on this right now.

290
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,167
That's outstanding, sergeant!

291
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:57,207
You're a credit to your
Mobile Infantry unit. Thank you.

292
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,564
When is the last time
you took a shower?

293
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:03,483
Let's worry about the sniff factor
after we get our asses unslung.

294
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:05,207
Yes, sir.

295
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,959
We could sit pretty tight if we could
shut this door, sergeant.

296
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:22,767
I'll get someone on it.

297
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,727
At least there's one man looking
in the right direction.

298
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:28,163
Yes, sir.

299
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,006
What's wrong with her, corporal?

300
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:42,798
It's the wind, sir.
Dries out the membranes.

301
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:46,878
- She'll be fine when she wakes up.
- She's got the right idea.

302
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:49,601
Good night, troopers.

303
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:51,646
Get some sleep, all of you!

304
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:53,527
That's an order.

305
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:55,839
- And, Dill...
- Yes, sir.

306
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,247
I want a full report of today's
action when I wake up...

307
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:02,162
...explaining how you got five
of my troopers killed.

308
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:03,887
Yes, sir.

309
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:10,840
You heard the man.
Hit the sack!

310
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:18,163
Not you, trooper.

311
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:19,603
Yes, sir?

312
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:23,318
Letting that criminal loose is a
court-martial offence, private.

313
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,922
I thought he could help us.

314
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:29,207
You thought the judgment of a murderer
was preferable to an officer's?

315
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,203
Well, that'll make for a hell
of a compelling defence.

316
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:37,360
I wasn't thinking, sir.
It was intuition.

317
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,487
Intuition?

318
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:48,002
I had no idea you were psychic.

319
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:50,603
I scored high when I was a kid, sir.

320
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:51,997
Really?

321
00:30:54,209 --> 00:30:56,404
Why aren't you wearing the black?

322
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:58,799
I became inconsistent, sir.

323
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,565
Onset of puberty?

324
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,800
It happens to you women.

325
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:08,927
- When is it gonna happen to you?
- Excuse me?

326
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:13,765
Puberty. I hear it's a necessary step
on the way to becoming a man.

327
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:16,602
You're addressing an
officer of the Federation.

328
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:19,488
Shove that officer crap
up your Buster Brown.

329
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:21,799
An officer who behaves
as you did today...

330
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:24,847
...and takes it out
on a trooper ain't a man!

331
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,524
I'm not a man? What kind of a man
turns his back on the Federation?

332
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:30,088
I'm glad you asked.

333
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:33,924
I trained a generation of people to
throw themselves into the grinder.

334
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:36,649
The Federation chewed them up
and spit them out.

335
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:40,597
So now when they say, " Push on
to glory," I say, "What glory?"

336
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:44,728
What would you know about glory?
You call yourself a hero?

337
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:50,168
No, son. That's something other people
call you, and it's really just a trick.

338
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:54,607
When you throw your life away, instead
of fool, they call you hero.

339
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:59,684
And as for glory, ask her. She'll
tell you everything you need to know!

340
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:02,237
How dare you?

341
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,887
Just one man's opinion.

342
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,643
No, it's not. It's treason!

343
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,439
Then maybe you ought to shoot me.

344
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:14,486
Now, there's something
we agree on.

345
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:17,959
Well, go ahead. Take out that
popgun and have at it, soldier.

346
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:24,159
I believe in the rules and regulations
that the Federation stands for.

347
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:26,206
Very good, lieutenant!

348
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:28,246
But you left out the kids.

349
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:30,286
- What?
- Cowards.

350
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:35,482
They always hide behind
rules and children.

351
00:32:45,449 --> 00:32:47,485
I'll see you hang!

352
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:50,766
Just so long as it's regulation rope.

353
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:59,048
Oh, let's see.

354
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:07,724
Got your mystery meat sticks,
egg caps, hardtack, beans.

355
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:11,677
Insta-veggie meal,
Choco-pudding Delite.

356
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:36,285
Sweet tooth, huh?

357
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:40,487
Taps in 15 minutes.

358
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:49,880
I'll get you!

359
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,568
Nice to have you with us, trooper.

360
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,486
You've been out for a long time.
How you feeling?

361
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:33,646
I feel good, sir.

362
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:35,202
You fit for duty?

363
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,726
Raring to go.

364
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:43,324
Well, that's outstanding.

365
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:21,648
What's the ETA on a door
we can shut, gentlemen?

366
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:25,643
Well, sir, I think that should do it.

367
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:28,277
If you'll hold on...

368
00:35:38,129 --> 00:35:41,519
- Watch out for the cables!
- The cables. Stop it! Stop it!

369
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:43,520
Do it, do it, do it.

370
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:47,604
Shit.

371
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:56,205
Great, you welded
the damn thing open.

372
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:57,597
You idiots.

373
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:00,963
All personnel to the perimeter.

374
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:05,528
Troopers, you heard the man.
Let's go!

375
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:08,283
Get moving!
Take that weapon. Come on.

376
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:11,680
Sandee, Horton, Soda, Brick,
come on, you lazy bastards.

377
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:15,159
Let's move it.
Move, move, move, move!

378
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,248
Sahara.

379
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:23,800
You two over there, you two
front and running. Where's my OP?

380
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:28,520
Man your post! Go, go, go!

381
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:38,038
- What's wrong?
- General, there's something...

382
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,437
Move!

383
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:44,367
Scouting parties, sir, 100 metres out.

384
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:46,485
When they figure
that fence is down...

385
00:36:46,649 --> 00:36:50,358
...they're gonna show up like relatives
to a rich man's funeral.

386
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:57,558
- Let there be light.
- Yeah.

387
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:02,160
- Yeah!
- Here we go. We got power.

388
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:05,202
That's what I'm talking about.
I can see you now.

389
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:07,929
Hey, general?

390
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:12,241
- Peck, is this your doing?
- It's a little wonky...

391
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:15,162
...but it'll hold. I hope.

392
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:17,399
You have our tremendous
gratitude, Peck.

393
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,084
Oh, it was nothing, sir.

394
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:24,800
I'll get back to work on the com now.

395
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:27,039
- Attaboy, Peck.
- Way to go, Peck.

396
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:31,839
Peck. Peck. Peck.

397
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:34,000
All right.

398
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:39,164
Dax, the charges
against you are serious...

399
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,207
...but I can't afford to lose a man
of your experience.

400
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:45,526
Give me your word
as an officer you'll do your duty.

401
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:49,808
I'm no longer an officer, general,
but I'll give you my word as a man.

402
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:53,200
Your rank is restored
until your guilt or innocence...

403
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,166
...is determined by a hearing.

404
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:58,367
Well, I can assure you
I killed Colonel Hohlback.

405
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:02,926
Then I guarantee you'll hang, but until
then, I expect you to do your duty.

406
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:05,683
- Yes, sir.
- I want forward OP.

407
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:07,965
Three watches a day.

408
00:38:08,129 --> 00:38:11,326
Fences fail, troopers get lazy.

409
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,447
- You carry on, captain.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:53,802
Something I can do for you?

411
00:38:54,009 --> 00:38:58,002
I just came to say thanks
for saving my ass.

412
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:00,245
That's the job.

413
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:04,566
How come you don't sleep inside
like everyone else?

414
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,602
I figure this is where
the enemy will show up.

415
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,399
No telling what kind of fun
you could get in out here, huh?

416
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:20,047
- Are you flirting with me, soldier?
- No, sir, I don't flirt.

417
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:24,322
- Never?
- Never ever, sir.

418
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:29,241
- Well, you're the real deal.
- The genuine article.

419
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:32,609
And you want some action.

420
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:36,965
You'll get all the action you want
after the Bugs show up.

421
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,040
You know...

422
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,959
...it's all the waiting that gets me.

423
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:55,204
Oh, I see.

424
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:59,766
You need something
to occupy your mind.

425
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,121
Come here.

426
00:40:16,209 --> 00:40:18,803
That's good right there.
Drop and give me 100.

427
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:22,288
- Sir?
- You got a lot of energy, trooper.

428
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:25,885
Now get down and start counting.

429
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,199
Yes, sir.

430
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:35,125
One, two, three, four...

431
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:39,764
...five, six, seven...

432
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:41,448
Make it 200.

433
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:12,118
You lose something?

434
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:18,322
Yo, you're the new guy, so l...

435
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,768
Can we play too?

436
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:24,445
I got mess duty.

437
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,601
- Thanks for the wake up, Soda.
- Pleasure.

438
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:30,326
You sure you know
what you're doing?

439
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:34,038
Oh, I got a pretty good idea, but...

440
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:36,638
...you know,
practice does make perfect.

441
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:39,403
Nice.

442
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:41,560
Come on, Billie.

443
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:18,599
No, no, forget it, Sandee. He's a jerk.

444
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:24,159
Hey, Sandee...

445
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:29,399
- What's with her?
- Horton's with the new girl.

446
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:34,002
- Sipping some Soda.
- Ain't war hell?

447
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,209
Who goes there?

448
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:51,405
Horton?

449
00:42:54,129 --> 00:42:56,279
Oh, it's you.

450
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:59,045
Sorry.

451
00:43:03,129 --> 00:43:04,847
You okay?

452
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:07,204
No.

453
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:10,646
- Anything I can do?
- No.

454
00:43:11,649 --> 00:43:14,368
At least let me take a look
at that cut on your chin.

455
00:43:14,569 --> 00:43:17,129
This? It's just a scratch.

456
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:19,685
General wants everybody tiptop.

457
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,239
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah?

458
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:30,242
How long have you been out here?

459
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:34,641
- All my life, it seems like.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

460
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:38,484
I've been here for eight months,
and I've only seen the sun twice.

461
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,166
Might be a little easier
if you took your helmet off, Jill.

462
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:51,161
God, what happened to your fingers?

463
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:55,004
- You know, muzzle burn.
- That looks really bad.

464
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:58,764
Hey, who's the medic here
anyway, huh?

465
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:03,319
Hey, Joe.

466
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:04,842
Yeah?

467
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,728
Has anybody ever told you
what a nice smile you have?

468
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:11,480
Yeah.

469
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:13,847
Probably.

470
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,325
Feeling better?

471
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:20,960
No.

472
00:44:23,249 --> 00:44:25,001
Do you want to?

473
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:57,407
- What happened to her, corporal?
- Just a nosebleed, sir.

474
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,480
She's gonna be fine.

475
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:02,959
- How do you feel?
- You know how I feel.

476
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,285
What gives?

477
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:11,043
It looks like we got
a couple new couples.

478
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:14,997
No wonder we're losing this war.
Everyone's fucking instead of fighting.

479
00:45:16,649 --> 00:45:19,004
What are you looking at?

480
00:45:19,169 --> 00:45:22,366
- Get back to work.
- I'll get to work.

481
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,482
- Good morning, captain.
- What makes you think so?

482
00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:33,719
Why, are we in for it?

483
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:38,280
- Sooner or later.
- You got time for breakfast?

484
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:43,762
You're welcome to join me, as long as
you don't expect cheerful conversation.

485
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:46,124
Not a morning person, huh?

486
00:45:46,289 --> 00:45:49,281
No, I'm a miserable, murdering bastard.

487
00:45:49,449 --> 00:45:52,009
- And that's on a good day.
- What's a bad day like?

488
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:55,127
Any one day in particular
you're interested in?

489
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:56,927
No.

490
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:03,364
That second lieu-y
send you to question me?

491
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:06,760
- Lieutenant Dill? He thinks I'm an idiot.
- Are you?

492
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:11,320
- Me? Yeah. Definitely.
- Trust me, I got you beat.

493
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:16,478
Well, I fell in love, and I got busted
down from corporal for fraternisation.

494
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:20,642
- So who wants to be a corporal?
- Here's the idiot part.

495
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,481
He got killed.

496
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:28,797
You really some kind of psychic?

497
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:33,282
Yeah. Maybe. I guess.
Not like Dill, not Psi Corps.

498
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,638
Well, your fella...

499
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:40,439
...did you know he was gonna
buy the farm?

500
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:42,998
It doesn't work that way.

501
00:46:43,169 --> 00:46:44,761
Well, that's good, I guess.

502
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:48,160
Maybe that's why I don't
believe in all that bunk.

503
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:53,282
Those tags belong
to the troopers that you lost...

504
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:57,084
...and you wear them because you feel
responsible for what happened.

505
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:59,564
That's a lucky guess.

506
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:03,039
- Why'd you kill your CO?
- You tell me.

507
00:47:03,209 --> 00:47:05,484
I'm not that good.

508
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:09,677
He gave some stupid orders
that got kids killed.

509
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:11,880
One day too many,
or too many one day.

510
00:47:12,049 --> 00:47:15,405
- Maybe I'm the wheel that broke.
- You ought to forgive yourself.

511
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:17,560
It's war.

512
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:21,323
Don't spend too much time
around me, trooper.

513
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:24,561
I'd hate to end up wearing your tags.

514
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:01,043
Stupid Bug.

515
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,688
You're relieved.

516
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,840
Thanks.

517
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:28,643
Hey... Hey, trooper?

518
00:48:31,049 --> 00:48:32,926
Who's that?

519
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:35,205
Peck.

520
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:40,278
Hey, sarge, what do you need?

521
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:43,805
Well, I could use a hand.

522
00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:48,161
Buddy, anything I can do
for you is aces by me.

523
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:54,399
You think you could
lie down on the fl...?

524
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:59,245
- The floor?
- Floor. And reach behind the cons...

525
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:03,721
I got it, I got it. You want me to lay on
the floor and reach behind the console.

526
00:49:06,089 --> 00:49:07,841
Okay.

527
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,960
Here we go.

528
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,565
Son of a...

529
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:20,160
How's this?

530
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:24,724
Oh, God!

531
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,601
Help!

532
00:49:27,689 --> 00:49:30,601
Gotta keep quiet.

533
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:43,603
Help! Help!

534
00:50:23,409 --> 00:50:24,728
We got com.

535
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:28,045
We got com.

536
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:33,966
This is Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Rescue.

537
00:50:34,129 --> 00:50:36,359
Come in, Fleet Rescue.

538
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:42,125
This is Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Rescue.

539
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:45,759
- This is...
- How's that report coming?

540
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:51,043
Well, I'm not so much writing a report
as building your gallows, Dax.

541
00:50:51,209 --> 00:50:54,884
- I didn't take you for a carpenter.
- Shift to Command frequency.

542
00:50:55,049 --> 00:50:58,086
There was this other carpenter
a few thousand years ago...

543
00:50:58,249 --> 00:51:00,604
...a better man than you or me.

544
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,920
Well, that carpentry business
was the death of him.

545
00:51:04,249 --> 00:51:07,127
Be careful of what you build
and what crosses you bear.

546
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:11,043
- Hotel Delta 185 to Fleet Command.
- Lieutenant.

547
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:16,328
Roger, Hotel Delta,
this is Fleet Command. Over.

548
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:21,119
This is the 701 st Mobile Infantry,
Bravo Company, requesting pickup.

549
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,560
Take a number, MI.
We got stragglers all over the planet.

550
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:29,125
- What's your name, sailor?
- Fleet Lieutenant Mary Klinghof.

551
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:32,878
- Getting smart won't help you, jarhead.
- You listen up, fruit fly.

552
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:35,244
This is General Jack Gordon Shepherd.

553
00:51:35,409 --> 00:51:38,446
And if somebody doesn't make
this pickup their priority...

554
00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:41,123
...I’m gonna make it
my priority to come down...

555
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:43,849
...and chew out some Fleet-ass,
starting with you.

556
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:47,081
Sorry, sir, I didn't know
who I was talking to.

557
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:49,519
- That's because you're a moron.
- Yeah.

558
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,362
Yes, sir, but we got
a lot of wounded out there.

559
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:56,238
The wounded come first. Any excuses
after that come out of your butt.

560
00:51:56,409 --> 00:51:58,525
Shepherd, out.

561
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:02,119
Where's Peck?
I'm gonna give him a medal.

562
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:05,201
- Asleep, sir. Dead on his feet.
- Well, he's earned it.

563
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:09,965
- Any day on that door, Brick.
- We're all waiting for something, sarge.

564
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:13,318
- But it ain't the door.
- Outstanding.

565
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:51,405
Not you, trooper.

566
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:53,884
- Lucky guess.
- We're all gonna die.

567
00:52:54,089 --> 00:52:58,241
- What would you know about glory?
- It doesn't work that way.

568
00:53:00,129 --> 00:53:03,087
- Lf he won't fight, shoot him!
- No!

569
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:06,961
- Sahara.
- I haven't seen him.

570
00:53:07,129 --> 00:53:09,199
- Wake up.
- The wheel that broke.

571
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,720
Wake up.

572
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:14,244
Wake up.

573
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:43,442
Give me a little more.
Don't be shy. Come on.

574
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:52,646
Yeah. Oh, trouble at the trough.

575
00:53:52,809 --> 00:53:54,925
It's gonna get ugly.

576
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:00,525
- What's eating Tor, huh?
- Not you.

577
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:05,644
Yeah, I guess you're right.
War does some weird things to people.

578
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:30,487
Everything okay?

579
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:39,886
No, I'm... Yeah, I'm fine.

580
00:54:57,409 --> 00:55:02,244
- You look a little shaky, trooper.
- Yeah, something's not right.

581
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:05,367
That's what they call it
when you're behind enemy lines.

582
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:07,360
It feels worse than that.

583
00:55:07,529 --> 00:55:10,362
Oh, is this another one
of your psychic hot flashes?

584
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:12,406
It seems like Tor has changed.

585
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:15,242
Because he wouldn't take
Brick's bait? About time.

586
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:18,879
- It seems sudden, sarge.
- Like you puking your guts out?

587
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,563
I guess I'm coming down
with something.

588
00:55:21,729 --> 00:55:24,448
- I wonder what that could be?
- There's a big knot...

589
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:26,201
...where my stomach used to be.

590
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:30,078
Sarge, I barely touched the medic's
hand just now, and I saw something.

591
00:55:30,249 --> 00:55:33,082
- You saw something?
- Something terrible.

592
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:37,488
- Maybe you're just going crazy.
- I love you too, sarge.

593
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:40,845
Girls get wacky
when they're pregnant.

594
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:44,280
Suddenly, they know everything
about everything.

595
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,168
Oh, Jesus.

596
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:52,205
Yeah, you're about as psychic
as a doorknob, trooper.

597
00:56:24,769 --> 00:56:26,566
You ready?

598
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:31,598
I'm kind of tired.

599
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:37,604
- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, thanks.

600
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,124
Oh, my shoe.

601
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:42,439
Don't worry about it.

602
00:56:46,929 --> 00:56:50,717
- Are you scared to shower, Otter?
- What does it matter?

603
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:53,602
We're going home
in a few hours anyway.

604
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:11,602
Hi, guys.

605
00:57:17,849 --> 00:57:19,487
Holy God, what the...?

606
00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:46,203
Oh, God. Oh, God.

607
00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:00,638
Open the door! Open the door!
We're gonna die in here!

608
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:02,959
Open the door!

609
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:35,966
Captain, I need to talk to you,
but it's gonna sound crazy.

610
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:38,364
- Well, spit it out, trooper.
- Look, sir...

611
00:58:38,529 --> 00:58:41,202
...I know I'm not really
supposed to be psychic...

612
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:43,325
...but I have this terrible feeling.

613
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:51,762
- Yes, sir.
- As you were.

614
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:57,003
We have a situation here that requires
the attention of Military Intelligence.

615
00:58:57,529 --> 00:58:59,997
- Tell him.
- This morning, in the mess...

616
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:03,684
...I accidentally touched Griff's hand.
I might've had a vision.

617
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,285
Playing psychic again, private?

618
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:08,883
Could you keep
an open mind here, lieutenant?

619
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,358
This trooper's
got information that's vital.

620
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:15,005
Some of the troopers have been
acting a little strange lately.

621
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:21,921
Describe what you saw.

622
00:59:22,089 --> 00:59:24,444
He wasn't a man.
He was some other thing.

623
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:27,169
Maybe 1000 things.
Somehow he was connected...

624
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:32,119
...to Tor and Sandee and Horton
and that new girl, Soda.

625
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:37,044
I've always been pretty fuzzy, sir,
and this came through sharp as a knife.

626
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,282
Lieutenant, I know I'm not
a real psychic like you.

627
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:45,328
In fact, I just found out
I'm pregnant, and I didn't have a clue.

628
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:50,760
- You're pregnant?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid so.

629
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:53,767
You might be interested to know
that in our studies...

630
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:57,478
...pregnancy has been shown
to heighten psychic ability.

631
00:59:57,649 --> 01:00:00,686
That's too bad because
I'd really like to be wrong.

632
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:06,361
Yes, me too, but I keep having
the same feeling.

633
01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:08,804
What is it?

634
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:10,925
They're coming to wipe us out.

635
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:13,762
What's so new about that?

636
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:19,124
I mean the whole species, everything
human. And they have a plan.

637
01:00:20,129 --> 01:00:23,599
Look, after what I did in the battle...

638
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:26,329
...I wasn't very sure
of myself anymore.

639
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:30,402
And I just figured everybody
thought I'd just cracked.

640
01:00:34,449 --> 01:00:38,442
Yesterday, I might have been
inclined to agree...

641
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:41,925
...but that would've been me
screwing up, lieutenant.

642
01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:48,445
Thank you, sir.

643
01:00:49,809 --> 01:00:54,883
I'll get on this matter
with General Shepherd immediately.

644
01:00:55,049 --> 01:00:58,041
Oh, and, trooper...

645
01:00:58,209 --> 01:01:00,245
...that was some good work.

646
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:02,286
Sir.

647
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:33,844
General Shepherd?

648
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,884
What are you doing in here?

649
01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:45,567
General Jack and I
were just having a chat.

650
01:01:45,729 --> 01:01:47,879
What are you doing here, Dill?

651
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:49,846
You and Shepherd?

652
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:55,525
Is that so hard to believe?

653
01:01:58,649 --> 01:02:00,526
General?

654
01:02:00,689 --> 01:02:03,362
General Shepherd?

655
01:02:07,649 --> 01:02:09,446
General...

656
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:27,446
They're inside of you. Oh, God.

657
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:33,407
Back up, or I'll drill your damn skull.

658
01:02:33,609 --> 01:02:35,998
Get back! Get away from the door.

659
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:37,688
Get away.

660
01:02:40,169 --> 01:02:43,718
You bastards. You're all under arrest...

661
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:48,326
...for murder, sedition,
for treason against the Federation...

662
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:52,166
Oh, and you're gonna pay
because we're not gonna kill you.

663
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:56,362
Oh, no. No, you see, we got
special places for things like you...

664
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:58,087
...where they cut you up.

665
01:02:58,249 --> 01:03:00,717
But they keep you alive
while they cut you up...

666
01:03:00,889 --> 01:03:05,679
...so they can see what makes you tick,
and they'll see what makes you sick.

667
01:03:05,889 --> 01:03:11,646
And I'll be there. Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna be there to see...

668
01:03:23,889 --> 01:03:26,483
You're under arrest, Dax.

669
01:03:26,649 --> 01:03:28,719
On what charge?

670
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,607
Murder.

671
01:03:53,689 --> 01:03:58,160
- Captain Dax, what's happening?
- No talking to the prisoner.

672
01:04:07,409 --> 01:04:11,004
Keep him covered.
You gave me your word, Dax.

673
01:04:11,209 --> 01:04:15,043
What makes you think I had
anything to do with this, general?

674
01:04:22,129 --> 01:04:25,917
- Lock him up, sergeant.
- Yes, sir. With pleasure, sir.

675
01:04:34,089 --> 01:04:37,365
- Get out of here now, Sahara.
- Move it.

676
01:04:45,889 --> 01:04:47,959
You know what to do, Billie.

677
01:04:48,129 --> 01:04:50,165
Yes, sir.

678
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:03,767
Why are you doing this, Billie?

679
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:07,598
It's not you and me.
It's gonna happen to all of us.

680
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:21,645
You trying to make a baby
with my barracks door, private?

681
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:29,127
Sahara, she don't want it,
but I gotta give her the Bug.

682
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:34,409
- There's a wire loose in your head.
- No, it's a little piece of God.

683
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:38,448
Not like the one people used
to believe in, or the Federation...

684
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:44,527
...and it's filling me up. I can sort
of feel myself floating away.

685
01:05:44,729 --> 01:05:47,527
Kid, you're not making any sense.

686
01:05:49,009 --> 01:05:51,807
You'll understand when you wake up.

687
01:05:51,969 --> 01:05:54,529
When I wake up?

688
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:03,560
- Don't fight.
- That'll be the day.

689
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:18,000
No!

690
01:06:56,209 --> 01:06:58,564
You lonely, captain?

691
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:49,882
Billie, please don't. Please.

692
01:11:32,769 --> 01:11:35,124
What the hell's going on, sergeant?

693
01:11:35,609 --> 01:11:38,726
- The Bugs are inside, sir.
- Inside the perimeter?

694
01:11:38,929 --> 01:11:40,521
No, sir.

695
01:11:42,009 --> 01:11:43,761
Inside me.

696
01:11:43,969 --> 01:11:46,324
Sergeant, no! No!

697
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:03,202
Keys.

698
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:08,364
- What the hell kind of Bug is that?
- Jesus.

699
01:12:08,929 --> 01:12:12,604
One that gets inside and takes over.
Maybe it can tell us something.

700
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:15,040
What are you talking about?

701
01:12:32,969 --> 01:12:36,006
Everything that happened here
was supposed to happen.

702
01:12:36,209 --> 01:12:38,598
The Bugs brought us here
to create a weapon.

703
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:41,642
- What kind of weapon?
- Shepherd!

704
01:12:42,289 --> 01:12:44,439
He could bring this
to the top of the Federation!

705
01:12:45,009 --> 01:12:46,442
We gotta kill the general.

706
01:13:06,209 --> 01:13:08,040
Fire in the hole!

707
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:15,723
You're gonna die!

708
01:13:17,969 --> 01:13:20,005
They don't kill so easy, do they?

709
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:22,598
- You're gonna die!
- They're not like us, sir.

710
01:13:22,809 --> 01:13:25,926
Not anymore. They're Bugs.

711
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:33,721
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die!

712
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:37,799
They shut down the reactors.

713
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:54,763
Sandee?

714
01:13:56,369 --> 01:13:57,961
Grenade!

715
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,680
Sahara, you okay?

716
01:14:10,129 --> 01:14:11,801
Poor creatures.

717
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:16,763
Why must we destroy you?

718
01:14:16,929 --> 01:14:18,521
I'll tell you why.

719
01:14:19,969 --> 01:14:23,644
Order is the tide of creation...

720
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:26,763
...but yours is a species...

721
01:14:27,089 --> 01:14:30,604
...that worships the one over the many.

722
01:14:31,169 --> 01:14:34,081
You glorify your intelligence...

723
01:14:34,249 --> 01:14:38,162
...because it allows you
to believe anything.

724
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:41,079
That you have a destiny.

725
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:44,359
That you have a right.

726
01:14:44,969 --> 01:14:47,199
That you have a cause.

727
01:14:47,689 --> 01:14:49,919
That you are special.

728
01:14:50,889 --> 01:14:52,880
That you are great.

729
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:54,920
But in truth...

730
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:59,887
...you are born insane.

731
01:15:01,769 --> 01:15:04,203
And such misery...

732
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:07,403
...cannot be allowed...

733
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:10,479
...to spread.

734
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:12,442
Kill them all!

735
01:15:18,129 --> 01:15:20,597
Sahara! You get the general!

736
01:17:30,449 --> 01:17:33,088
- General Shepherd!
- That's me!

737
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:36,726
You can't take him! Whatever you do,
don't let him onboard!

738
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:42,245
Hey, general!

739
01:18:01,889 --> 01:18:04,278
Listen up. She needs medical attention.

740
01:18:04,449 --> 01:18:06,758
You just killed
a general officer, mister!

741
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:09,363
Lots of generals out there, flyboy!

742
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:13,324
This trooper's got information vital
to the survival of the Federation!

743
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:16,447
She must reach safety at all costs!
You get me?

744
01:18:16,649 --> 01:18:18,162
Yes, sir!

745
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,718
- Let's go!
- There are too many of them, Dax!

746
01:18:23,889 --> 01:18:27,643
You gotta tell them what you saw.
You gotta tell them about the new Bug!

747
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:29,441
You stay here, you'll die!

748
01:18:29,649 --> 01:18:31,207
Murderers don't go home.

749
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:37,643
Dax!

750
01:18:41,969 --> 01:18:44,039
Dax!

751
01:19:29,049 --> 01:19:32,678
Dax. More than a soldier,
not just a man.

752
01:19:32,889 --> 01:19:34,686
A hero of the Federation.

753
01:19:38,369 --> 01:19:41,202
He gave his life so we could fight...

754
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,639
...and these words for us to live by. ¨

755
01:19:43,809 --> 01:19:48,883
"Shed no tears for me.
My glory lives forever."

756
01:20:01,689 --> 01:20:03,998
And now you too can live the glory...

757
01:20:04,169 --> 01:20:07,923
...because it's easy to be a hero
in the Mobile Infantry.

758
01:20:08,089 --> 01:20:10,649
Men and women like you
are signing up every day...

759
01:20:10,809 --> 01:20:13,687
...to serve the Federation
and save the galaxy!

760
01:20:13,849 --> 01:20:15,760
Isn't it time you did your part?

761
01:20:15,929 --> 01:20:17,328
Beautiful baby, ma'am.

762
01:20:18,409 --> 01:20:19,683
Thank you, sergeant.

763
01:20:19,889 --> 01:20:22,449
Think how impressed friends
and teachers will be!

764
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:23,883
Everyone loves a citizen!

765
01:20:24,049 --> 01:20:25,368
Little trooper likes me.

766
01:20:25,569 --> 01:20:28,129
Sign up, and one day
they'll call you a hero too!

767
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:31,804
Hurry up, spud.
We need fresh meat for the grinder.

768
01:20:44,649 --> 01:20:49,439
Shed no tears for me.
My glory lives forever.

769
