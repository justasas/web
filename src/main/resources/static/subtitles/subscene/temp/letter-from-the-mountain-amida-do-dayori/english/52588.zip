LETTER FROM THE MOUNTAIN

2
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,044
You're panting...

3
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:10,498
I'd forgotten what
the place looked like.

4
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:18,069
And now we're going to live here...

5
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:28,015
We've been living too fast.
It's time to slow down a bit.

6
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:38,157
There's only so much you can do
by sheer force of will.

7
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,020
And who might you be?

8
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,862
How are you? I'm Takao,
Ueda Sei's grandson.

9
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:21,559
I've moved back
to the village.

10
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:23,730
Well, isn't that nice!

11
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,535
Please...

12
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:29,009
...step inside for a bit.

13
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,372
This is my wife, Michiko.

14
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:40,245
Please, please, step in.

15
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:27,134
The water's from yesterday...

16
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:31,229
...so the tea might not be
very hot.

17
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:49,257
Oh, thank you.

18
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,421
Thank you.

19
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:57,393
At least cold tea
won't burn you.

20
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:17,415
It's not very hot.

21
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,191
How long has it been...

22
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:31,493
...since Sei died?

23
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:36,468
Grandma died five years ago.
She was 81.

24
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,132
It stopped raining
for her funeral...

25
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:47,139
Sei was ten years
younger than me.

26
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:52,780
So you're 96, Miss Ume?

27
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:55,781
Me?

28
00:06:56,192 --> 00:07:02,529
Well, once I passed 90
I decided...

29
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:08,398
...that whatever age
everybody said I was...

30
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:13,373
...was the age I'd be.

31
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:23,375
Sei had a very hard life...

32
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:30,492
...but she was a lovely person,
very accomplished.

33
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:39,033
Miss Ume... we brought this
to say hello.

34
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:42,761
Well, well, well!

35
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,872
Aren't you a dear!

36
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:49,411
That's very nice of you.

37
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,112
Thank you.

38
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:54,607
Sei...

39
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:03,692
Look what Takao brought!

40
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,422
I'll give you some later.

41
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:16,968
Mrs Ueda, I understand
you're going to be working...

42
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,534
...at the clinic in the village.

43
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:21,837
Yes.

44
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:24,836
I've been ill myself...

45
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:30,977
...so I'll just be there
three mornings a week, though.

46
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:34,955
Well, even that much...

47
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:39,721
...is something to be
grateful for.

48
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:02,078
Welcome Dr Ueda Michiko

49
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:05,712
Sei didn't want you
moving to Tokyo.

50
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:06,685
She didn't?

51
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:11,123
She said you were like
your dead mother, always reading.

52
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:15,095
She was afraid you'd turn out
a 'cherry-blossom farmer'.

53
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:19,523
If he'd stayed here,
he'd never have found a wife.

54
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:24,600
But why would a famous doctor
marry Takao?

55
00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:34,377
I liked the idea of a farmer who'd
stop to look at cherry blossoms

56
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:38,843
You know what that means, then?

57
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:42,680
A dreamer so absorbed
in cherry blossoms..

58
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:46,057
...that he doesn't
get his work done.

59
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:51,196
The kind of man we always tell
our girls not to marry.

60
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:58,364
I'm not very brave,
and I'm not very talented...

61
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,807
...so I chose something practical,
like medicine.

62
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:05,404
That's why I chose farming!

63
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:08,506
That's not even practical!

64
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:12,420
As our guests are looking
a little tired...

65
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:16,582
...perhaps they'd like to wash off
that city dust in our hot spring.

66
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:19,718
Yes, Mr Mayor.
Let's close this meeting.

67
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:29,938
This village finally
has itself a doctor again.

68
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:35,005
This doctor's also being
a noted researcher...

69
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:40,344
...makes her someone far beyond
anything we could have wished for.

70
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,119
May she never leave her
cherry-blossom farmer behind...

71
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:51,592
...and depart from this village.

72
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:55,858
I also ask that everyone
in the village gives her...

73
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:58,456
...their complete cooperation.

74
00:10:58,567 --> 00:10:59,693
That's all.

75
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:09,041
Thank you!

76
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:11,628
Well?

77
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:19,970
It's wonderful. The water
feels so soft...

78
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:24,974
I'd forgotten how far
you can see here.

79
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,127
Good night.

80
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:39,352
Doesn't this bedding still have
your grandmother's smell to it?

81
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:45,322
Yeah, I feel like
I'm a little boy again.

82
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:24,093
Good morning.

83
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:04,733
Let's eat.

84
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:21,888
How is it?

85
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:23,253
Good.

86
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:39,273
'Unbowed by the rain,
Unbowed by the wind... '

87
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:42,007
That's Miyazawa Kenji.

88
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:51,844
My mother copied that out
years ago.

89
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:59,590
'Unbowed by the rain,
Unbowed by the wind...

90
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:04,288
'Unbowed by snow or summer heat,
Sound of body...

91
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,428
'Coveting nothing,
never angry...

92
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:11,131
'Always quietly smiling...

93
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:23,382
'Leaving himself
out of the account...

94
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:28,013
'Watching, listening, understanding
and not forgetting...

95
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:34,228
'Living in the shade of a pine grove,
in a field, in a small thatched hut...

96
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:38,993

he tends...

97
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:44,105

98

'To one dying in the south
he says, "Do not fear"...

99
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:56,479
'To quarrels or lawsuits in the north
he says, "Be not petty"...

100
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,047
'In drought he weeps...

00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:02,953
'In a cold summer he paces...

'Not praised, not criticised.:

104
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:13,164
'I want to be
that kind of man. '

105
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:32,910
Good morning.

106
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:36,553
Lovely day, isn't it.

107
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,747
Here's the doctor.

108
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,916
Good morning.

109
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,957
It's nice to see you here.

110
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:51,760
Hello, Doctor!

111
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,962
Good morning, Sensei.

112
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:42,283
Well! If it isn't Takao!

113
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:43,510
Yes.

114
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:46,483
Should you be doing that?

115
00:20:47,723 --> 00:20:52,626
'If the sun shines,
though tomorrow the world end...

116
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:57,461
'... do not omit
to dry your bedding. '

117
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:01,900
So how are you feeling?

118
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:03,296
Is that why you're here?

119
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:04,167
No!

120
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:06,264
I won't go into hospital.

121
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:11,645
The doctors call it
'stomach cancer'...

122
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:17,509
...but in 'cancer' is the word 'can'.
Certain things become possible.

123
00:21:19,021 --> 00:21:20,420
Come in.

124
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:29,857
It's inconvenient now, but once
I'm dead I can do what I want.

125
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,432
Sensei...

126
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,902
...where are all your books?

127
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,473
I gave them to the school.

128
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,472
Welcome back!

129
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:52,916
It makes the place
look a bit empty...

130
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:57,481
I want everything all cleared away
for once in my life.

131
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:00,786
We have no children.

132
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:04,992
I'm leaving nothing behind,
and I don't want to.

133
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,965
It's a load off my mind.

134
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:13,666
I still have your letter from when
I won my 'Best New Writer' prize.

135
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:20,878
'Becoming famous is
by no means a good thing.

136
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,484
'It does not elevate you.

137
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:29,385
'The purpose of creativity
is not reputation or success.

138
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:33,888
'Think of being the subject
of people's idle gossip...

139
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:36,328
'... as embarrassing. '

140
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:38,592
That was rude.

141
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:45,202
In the ten years since
I haven't accomplished anything.

142
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,703
You've only just started!

143
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:52,409
I'm over 40 and
I haven't made any money.

144
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:57,949
I've started to wonder
whether I'm worth anything.

145
00:22:59,054 --> 00:23:01,648
It's an important time for you.

146
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,522
Patience, patience...

147
00:23:06,695 --> 00:23:08,492
Like him.

148
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:14,735
Even at my age you're not sure
if you're really worth anything.

149
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:16,394
But who cares?

150
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:22,034
Just walk your own path
and regret nothing.

151
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:24,371
I will.

152
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:49,262
For all my children care,
I might as well not be here.

153
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,235
No?

154
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,168
And after all the trouble
you went to!

155
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:57,041
Yes! You put them through school,
they move away...

156
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:00,239
...and never even come home
to visit!

157
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:04,910
You're lucky. At least yours
come at New Year's and in August.

158
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,013
Yes! Twice a year
is more than most.

159
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:11,922
Mine only come once!

160
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,861
If there's any problem,
call me.

161
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:17,488
I will, thank you.

162
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,826
Isn't it nice to have
a good doctor here!

163
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:25,934
We'll keep you on
the same medicine.

164
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,841
As old as I am, Doctor...

165
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:34,041
...it hardly matters
if I take medicine or not.

166
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,119
There you go.

167
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,520
Takao!

168
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:45,354
Yes?

169
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:52,761
The village newsletter.

170
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:56,199
I could pass that around
if you wanted.

171
00:24:56,304 --> 00:25:01,105
Could you? We'll be busy
in the fields pretty soon.

172
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,905
It's all yours.

173
00:25:04,579 --> 00:25:05,637
'Bye.

174
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:07,547
Thank you.

00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,838
'...in my garden
and water them.

180
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:40,744
'Thinking this way of only
what is before me...

181
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:44,152
'...I suddenly find myself
96 years of age.

182
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,620
'Is it a good thing...

183
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:53,294
'...that I looked at nothing else
and did not add to my worries?

184
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,057
'That may be the secret
to a long life. '

185
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:03,265
Isn't that great!

186
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:09,975
Miss Ume was in hospital with
high blood pressure last winter.

187
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:13,138
They asked me to go see her.

188
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:17,141
Let's go after we eat.

189
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:16,837
I always fall asleep
at this time of day.

190
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,943
I'm sorry to worry you.

191
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:24,481
Not at all.

192
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:28,311
I thought I might come
and check your blood pressure.

193
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:31,620
My blood pressure, eh?

194
00:27:32,427 --> 00:27:34,622
All right.

195
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:41,326
Right here?

196
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:43,301
Here we go.

197
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:47,341
I should lie here?

198
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:51,334
All right?

199
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:52,708
Yes.

200
00:27:56,618 --> 00:27:59,052
I'II lift your arm...

201
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:09,259
Blood pressure!

202
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,993
Here goes...

203
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:35,948
135 over 82. That's very good.

204
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:40,088
That's good to hear.

205
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:42,721
I'll take this off.

206
00:28:47,702 --> 00:28:49,727
Can I get up?

207
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:51,897
All right?

208
00:28:59,414 --> 00:29:03,714
It's so nice for you to do this
for such an old lady...

209
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,121
Are you finished?

210
00:29:09,224 --> 00:29:12,682
I'm finished. That's it.

211
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,960
Why did your blood pressure
go up last year, Miss Ume?

212
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:26,029
Last year?

213
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:33,614
I was digging a latrine.
There's no toilet here.

214
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:35,649
So I was digging.

215
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:39,376
That's when I started
feeling strange.

216
00:29:39,754 --> 00:29:43,451
Digging latrines all the time
must be hard on you.

217
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:47,884
I'll build you an outhouse.

218
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,463
An outhouse?

219
00:29:49,564 --> 00:29:51,156
You?

220
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,201
Well, I'd like that,
but you know...

221
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:59,501
...I don't have any money.

222
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:03,037
Don't worry about money.

223
00:30:03,144 --> 00:30:07,808
I've got some stuff at home.
I'll build you one.

224
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:10,908
I'm strong and healthy.

225
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:18,551
It's a shame to waste health
and strength on a job like that.

226
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:22,696
But if you would...

227
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:27,325
...I'd be very grateful.

228
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:29,835
Leave it to me.

229
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,974
It's so nice here...

230
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:50,989
A fallen tree...

231
00:30:55,363 --> 00:30:57,354
Listen to the birds!

232
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:07,674
Watch your step...

233
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:01,322
Careful...

234
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:12,233
Gotcha!

235
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:17,208
Got her!

236
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,745
You got me!

237
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:21,877
Here we go!

238
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,442
Who's it?

239
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:26,611
There he is!

240
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,816
This way!

241
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:35,055
Wait!

242
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,892
Got you!

243
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:42,793
Aw, you got me!

244
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:45,634
After him, everyone!

245
00:32:46,307 --> 00:32:47,001
Here we go...

246
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:50,703
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

247
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:03,450
Wow!

248
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:06,453
Come on...

249
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:11,429
Aw, too bad!

250
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:19,833
Wow, look at them go!

251
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:21,704
There's some steps...

252
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:23,106
Yes!

253
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:38,922
They're way over there!

254
00:33:40,428 --> 00:33:41,759
They're so fast!

255
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:51,162
Bye-bye!

256
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:54,802
OK, goodbye.

257
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,638
Oh, thank you.

258
00:33:57,478 --> 00:33:58,638
See you.

259
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,907
Bye-bye!

260
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:13,051
'In the sunset glow
the day ends...

261
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:19,930
'From the mountain comes
the sound of the temple bell...

00:34:20,201 --> 00:34:27,164

Let's go.

270
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:39,274
Why am I crying
when I'm not sad?

271
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:18,675
Oh, my! That's a long way
to carry all that.

272
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:20,447
Good morning.

273
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,323
Hello.

274
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,703
This is Sayuri.

275
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:47,948
She can't talk.

276
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:00,058
Thank you.

277
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:08,928
'Three years ago an illness affected
my throat, and I still can't speak. '

278
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:20,141
Sayuri...

279
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:26,378
...writes down the things
that I say.

280
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:29,012
That thing you
were talking about.

281
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:31,418
Oh, the 'Letter from
the Mountain'?

282
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:33,015
That's right.

283
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,022
That column is
very well-written.

284
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,996
Simple yet meaningful.

285
00:37:44,872 --> 00:37:52,608
You know the doctor at the clinic?
This gentleman's her husband.

286
00:37:55,182 --> 00:37:58,515
A long, long time ago...

287
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,381
...he used to live in the village,
just over there.

288
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:09,325
Right now he's not
doing anything.

289
00:38:10,131 --> 00:38:16,001
So he's here digging away
on an outhouse for me.

290
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,003
Aren't you.

291
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:27,907
'I heard you're a novelist. '

292
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:33,417
Well, it's embarrassing
when people call me that.

293
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:40,959
I haven't written anything since
I won a prize over ten years ago.

294
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:43,189
I'm more like a failed novelist.

295
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:48,663
Right!

296
00:38:50,638 --> 00:38:54,130
These 'novels' of yours...

297
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,843
...are they lies...

298
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:00,413
...or are they true stories?

299
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:04,848
Well, they're not 'true'.

300
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:10,082
Maybe they're lies told
in order to tell the truth.

301
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:13,856
All right, then...

302
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:18,227
...you can't eat burdock
straight from the field...

303
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:21,859
...but you can cook it
to make kinpira.

304
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,864
If you ask which is 'real',
it's burdock from the field...

305
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:32,606
...but if it wasn't kinpira
you'd never know how good it was.

306
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:35,511
Something like that.

307
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:38,481
You write about kinpira?

308
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:41,987
No, you don't understand.
I mean...

309
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:50,525
'I think a novel is Amitabha
taking the form of words. '

310
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:58,405
Now, that's something
I can understand!

311
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:08,246
I've lived to the age I have...

312
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:12,479
...and I've heard my fill
of sad stories.

313
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:16,647
Now I want to hear
happy stories.

314
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:20,557
No one wants to spend money...

315
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:26,800
...to buy a sad story.

316
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:32,032
When I hear a happy story...

317
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:35,870
...I want to feel happy, too.

318
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:45,541
Look, the clouds have gone
from the mountains.

319
00:41:10,744 --> 00:41:13,042
Mrs Takeda?

320
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:14,307
Yes?

321
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:17,214
Hello.

322
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,955
Hello. How are you?

323
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:27,458
Here's the newsletter.

324
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,028
I'II leave it here.

325
00:41:31,298 --> 00:41:33,926
What are you growing now?

326
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,532
Vegetables.

327
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:39,633
We can eat them here at home.

328
00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:42,235
What do you enjoy doing?

329
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:44,174
Having tea with the neighbours.

330
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:46,576
So you talk over tea?

331
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,947
Yes, a little talk in the morning
and I'm happy all day.

332
00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:53,320
That's good for you.

333
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,648
Yes, it is.

334
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:56,349
Good for you.

335
00:41:56,457 --> 00:41:58,254
I'll bring this again.

336
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:00,759
If you need anything,
tell me then.

337
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:03,591
I'll see you again.

338
00:42:07,768 --> 00:42:10,464
Hello? Mrs Ohira?

339
00:42:11,338 --> 00:42:13,602
Here's the newsletter.

340
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:16,668
How are you?

341
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:20,213
Well, my back's
been hurting me.

342
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:21,008
Your back?

343
00:42:21,115 --> 00:42:25,108
Yes. It hurts and I can't
hang out my laundry.

344
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:28,687
When it gets better
I have to get out in the garden.

345
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,859
So what are you doing
about drying your laundry?

346
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,290
Oh, I manage the best I can.
I can't dry my bedding, though.

347
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,799
I see...

348
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:44,234
Do you have anything
that you're worried about?

349
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:46,096
Worried?

350
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:50,268
Everybody helps me out, so...

351
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:51,036
You're OK...

352
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:52,942
Yes, thank you.

353
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:56,780
Here's the village newsletter.

354
00:42:58,452 --> 00:42:59,384
I'II leave it here.

355
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:01,579
Thank you.

356
00:43:01,689 --> 00:43:04,624
Take care. I'll see you again.

357
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:06,784
That's it? I'm sorry
I wasn't more help.

358
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:07,758
I'll see you.

359
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:10,261
All right. Thank you.

360
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:13,197
Thank you.

361
00:43:14,768 --> 00:43:18,966
When did you first
start living in the village?

362
00:43:19,073 --> 00:43:23,271
Here? In, uh, 1947.

363
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:24,708
1947?

364
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:29,112
We were evacuated
in 1946.

365
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,677
From Manchuria?

366
00:43:31,785 --> 00:43:32,308
Yes.

367
00:43:32,419 --> 00:43:36,185
That's when you came here...
Were you alone then?

368
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,694
No. Then it was one child,
my husband and me.

369
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:43,854
It must have been difficult.

370
00:43:43,964 --> 00:43:47,456
Well, I was lucky.

371
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:51,095
I'd just given birth.

372
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:56,233
I had milk, so I was able to
nurse other babies, too.

373
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,207
I see.

374
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,741
'Letter from the Mountain.:

375
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,386
'There's everything
in the fields...

376
00:44:09,423 --> 00:44:14,360
'... eggplant, cucumber, tomatoes,
squash, watermelon.

377
00:44:15,229 --> 00:44:20,758
'I've always eaten whatever
my body told me it wanted.

378
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:27,565
'If eating plain food has
anything to do with long life...

379
00:44:28,342 --> 00:44:32,506
'... then I've lived long
because I've had no money.

380
00:44:33,814 --> 00:44:37,477
'I'm lucky to have been poor. '

381
00:44:42,956 --> 00:44:46,221
Takao and his wife are here.

382
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:54,128
As long as it's not a house call.

383
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:28,558
Hello!

384
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:40,175
'Rise to heaven on a great wind'...
I get closer every day.

385
00:45:42,983 --> 00:45:44,917
That's by Ryokan...

386
00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:52,988
Clean lines, as if a nice breeze
was blowing through...

387
00:45:53,093 --> 00:45:55,618
I'm not there yet.

388
00:45:56,263 --> 00:46:01,997
Writing that and tearing it up...
he practises all day long.

389
00:46:02,703 --> 00:46:03,965
Here.

390
00:46:04,138 --> 00:46:10,441
It's the form I'm after.
Form's the main thing.

391
00:46:10,644 --> 00:46:14,842
Form traces
the outline of the soul.

392
00:46:17,718 --> 00:46:21,552
Anyway, this is what
absorbs me now.

393
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,987
Bring that thing, will you?

394
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,057
Oh... all right.

395
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:33,290
Were you ill?

396
00:46:35,068 --> 00:46:35,932
Uh, yes.

397
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:41,633
It's good for a doctor to know
what it's like to be sick.

398
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:44,743
Yes, that's true.

399
00:46:51,285 --> 00:46:53,378
I want you to have this.

400
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,987
You're the one who should.

401
00:46:57,424 --> 00:47:01,417
You remember. The sword
I use for the temple Noh dance.

402
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:05,661
I couldn't...

403
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,292
Take it.

404
00:47:33,193 --> 00:47:39,996
I know they want me to take your place
at the Winter Festival, but...

405
00:47:43,136 --> 00:47:47,197
I taught you the dance.
Take that sword and do it for me.

406
00:47:49,042 --> 00:47:52,842
That's a load off my mind.

407
00:47:55,015 --> 00:48:00,510
Isn't that nice. One more thing
we've got cleared up.

408
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:06,685
I think I'll write a bit more.

409
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:21,204
We should be going.

410
00:48:29,149 --> 00:48:32,880
Don't you worry yourselves
about me.

411
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:58,674
Is he eating well?

412
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:02,740
Same as ever.
He eats what he wants.

413
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,449
Is he in pain?

414
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:09,419
He won't say.
He's very stubborn.

415
00:49:10,324 --> 00:49:15,057
I'll call in from time to time.
If there's anything, call me.

416
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:17,753
We won't tell him.

417
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,533
Thank you.

418
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:24,660
I guess miracles don't happen,
do they.

419
00:50:24,765 --> 00:50:27,029
No.

420
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:44,011
Well...

421
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:44,811
No luck.

422
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:46,249
Let's move.

423
00:51:28,495 --> 00:51:31,293
There! I got one!

424
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:34,661
Got it!

425
00:51:44,478 --> 00:51:46,469
I did it!

426
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:49,945
I'm so happy!

427
00:51:51,284 --> 00:51:53,149
Really happy!

428
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,383
There's ginger...

429
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:02,786
And a mugwort!

430
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:06,930
Hi, Doctor!

431
00:52:09,736 --> 00:52:10,600
Hello.

432
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:11,762
Where were you?

433
00:52:11,872 --> 00:52:13,396
Look!

434
00:52:14,474 --> 00:52:16,135
I caught it!

435
00:52:16,576 --> 00:52:19,044
Good, eh?

436
00:52:19,146 --> 00:52:19,942
Just one?

437
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:21,570
Yeah, just one.

438
00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:24,848
Where were you?

439
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:27,476
Picking herbs. Here.

440
00:52:27,587 --> 00:52:29,782
Oh, wow!

441
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,652
Thank you!

442
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:33,953
Isn't that sweet!

443
00:52:36,263 --> 00:52:37,321
See you.

444
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,295
Bye-bye.

445
00:52:44,938 --> 00:52:46,337
Bye-bye.

446
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:27,174
It's done.

447
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,476
There.

448
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,552
You caught it.

449
00:53:34,654 --> 00:53:36,087
No, you have it.

450
00:53:36,189 --> 00:53:36,712
No!

451
00:53:36,823 --> 00:53:38,154
Yes.

452
00:53:45,298 --> 00:53:46,765
It's crisp.

453
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:48,300
It sounds good.

454
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:08,513
I know...

455
00:54:14,694 --> 00:54:17,356
We can have 'kotsuzake'.

456
00:54:19,332 --> 00:54:20,765
Give me that.

457
00:54:33,246 --> 00:54:34,440
Um...

458
00:54:35,015 --> 00:54:39,748
...don't you need
a raw char for kotsuzake?

459
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,514
This'll do for today.

460
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:08,872
Good for what ails you, huh?

461
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:13,878
If you're going to fish...

462
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:17,718
...it has to be a mountain stream.

463
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:19,751
Give me some.

464
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:44,116
Good night.

465
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:42,608
Are you sleeping well?

466
00:56:42,709 --> 00:56:46,805
Oh yes, I sleep very well.

467
00:56:46,913 --> 00:56:52,146
So well I don't even dream.

468
00:56:52,252 --> 00:56:54,220
That's good.

469
00:56:54,421 --> 00:56:57,390
Sleep is the basis of health.

470
00:56:57,891 --> 00:57:01,019
I sleep very well here, too.

471
00:57:05,165 --> 00:57:09,693
Has there ever been a time
when you couldn't sleep?

472
00:57:10,003 --> 00:57:15,202
When it rains and I can't
get around much...

473
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:18,042
...I don't sleep very well.

474
00:57:19,279 --> 00:57:21,440
What do you do then?

475
00:57:21,548 --> 00:57:22,139
Eh?

476
00:57:22,248 --> 00:57:23,647
What do you do then?

477
00:57:23,883 --> 00:57:28,980
Then I just listen to
the water flowing over there...

478
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:34,220
...and imagine that
I was water, too.

479
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:39,993
I think of myself
just flowing along...

480
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,228
...and suddenly there I am
asleep.

481
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:47,702
When you turn to water,
where do you flow to?

482
00:57:48,108 --> 00:57:51,236
Well, I flow with the water...

483
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:55,337
...way, way, far away...

484
00:57:55,448 --> 00:58:00,283
...and about the time I'm thinking
I've reached the sea...

485
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,653
...there I am asleep.

486
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:12,225
We hear the sound of the river
every night...

487
00:58:12,465 --> 00:58:14,990
...but I don't feel like that.

488
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:19,995
You're both still young.

489
00:58:20,106 --> 00:58:23,940
You've still got to listen to
a lot of things.

490
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:28,605
The river's there,
and you have to hear it...

491
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:33,175
...but the sound of water's
no use to you.

492
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:38,815
It's something for
old folks to listen to.

493
00:58:44,864 --> 00:58:49,028
When did you stop taking
your sleeping pills?

494
00:58:53,973 --> 00:58:55,634
Yes...

495
00:58:57,177 --> 00:59:00,112
The night I caught that char.

496
00:59:05,785 --> 00:59:07,252
You know...

497
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:15,023
...I'm glad I came to this village.

498
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:18,525
Thank you.

499
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,438
They say if you shout about
something good, it flees.

500
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,688
Is that a bird?

501
01:00:20,093 --> 01:00:21,822
It's a frog.

502
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,561
It is not!

503
01:00:25,898 --> 01:00:27,889
The 'singing frog'.

504
01:00:30,036 --> 01:00:33,028
It only lives in clear streams

505
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:44,082
I love this... it's like the mountain's
rocking us to sleep.

506
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:10,930
'Be not a burden...

507
01:02:11,637 --> 01:02:18,008
'... rather be a help,
asking no reward. '

508
01:02:19,746 --> 01:02:22,214
Mr Koda's calligraphy?

509
01:02:22,315 --> 01:02:23,441
Yes.

510
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:29,344
It was the motto at his school
in Manchuria.

511
01:02:32,058 --> 01:02:34,856
You were married in China?

512
01:02:35,194 --> 01:02:36,388
Yes.

513
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:43,761
But the Russians took him and
put him in a work camp in Siberia.

514
01:02:44,871 --> 01:02:48,534
I fled with our baby
and what I could carry...

515
01:02:50,143 --> 01:02:55,445
...but the child died.
I couldn't even have his ashes.

516
01:02:58,217 --> 01:03:02,085
For 11 years after the war
I was alone...

517
01:03:02,922 --> 01:03:06,619
...waiting for my husband
to come back from Siberia.

518
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:10,095
Then he said...

519
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:17,934
...'If I'd really been a good man,
I wouldn't have lived to come back. '

520
01:03:20,606 --> 01:03:24,098
But he came back, safe and sound.

521
01:03:28,748 --> 01:03:31,410
Did he say anything
about your child?

522
01:03:33,553 --> 01:03:38,388
'I guess it was his destiny. '
And never another word about it.

523
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,223
'I guess it was his destiny'...

524
01:03:51,404 --> 01:03:54,271
Soon I'll be alone again.

525
01:03:56,108 --> 01:03:58,906
The days will be long.

526
01:04:32,178 --> 01:04:36,774
Takao, why don't we buy
a new household shrine?

527
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,642
This one's so drab...

528
01:04:42,822 --> 01:04:44,414
They're expensive.

529
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:47,482
So?

530
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:55,525
Because of those ancestors
you're here, and now so am I.

531
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,530
Wouldn't it be nice...

532
01:05:01,507 --> 01:05:07,377
...to live the rest of our lives here
and become ancestors too?

533
01:05:14,053 --> 01:05:15,384
Yes, it would.

534
01:06:20,486 --> 01:06:22,113
Look at it burn!

535
01:06:23,723 --> 01:06:26,556
There it goes again.

536
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:31,360
It's done.

537
01:06:32,064 --> 01:06:32,928
No more.

538
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:34,329
That's all.

539
01:06:55,655 --> 01:07:01,616
'May Amitabha's name be praised'...

540
01:07:10,169 --> 01:07:11,932
'Letter from the Mountain.:

541
01:07:13,105 --> 01:07:18,839
'At the O-bon Festival in August,
the dead come to visit Amitabha Hall.

542
01:07:19,779 --> 01:07:25,308
'With fire I light their way,
and talk with them until dark.

543
01:07:25,685 --> 01:07:31,089
'As we talk, I no longer know
if I am of this world...

544
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,021
'... or of theirs.

545
01:07:34,326 --> 01:07:39,059
'This did not happen
when I was younger.

546
01:07:40,633 --> 01:07:41,657
'I do not fear them.

547
01:07:43,536 --> 01:07:48,803
'I would happily pass
this way into eternal sleep. '

548
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:40,485
See you at New Year's!

549
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:07,807
After six months, Michiko's
reputation here is high.

550
01:09:08,716 --> 01:09:13,983
She listens to the elderly,
responding not only with kindness...

551
01:09:14,088 --> 01:09:16,283
...but with good diagnoses.

552
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:23,625
The Mayor came to ask
if she might work every day...

553
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:29,866
...but Michiko said she wanted
to go on the way she is.

554
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:31,901
Now let's see your eyes.

555
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:38,274
Open your mouth...

556
01:09:38,379 --> 01:09:40,313
Stick out your tongue...

557
01:09:42,016 --> 01:09:43,483
Look up.

558
01:09:47,889 --> 01:09:49,356
Now the throat...

559
01:09:52,093 --> 01:09:53,526
Does that hurt?

560
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:55,722
No?

561
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:58,756
How about here?

562
01:10:00,635 --> 01:10:01,795
OK?

563
01:10:04,138 --> 01:10:06,003
Look down.

564
01:10:13,214 --> 01:10:15,273
'Letter from the Mountain.:

565
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:19,944
'As a girl I was always
running fevers...

566
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:23,420
'... and couldn't help much
at home.

567
01:10:24,826 --> 01:10:31,322
'Neither my family nor the villagers
expected I would live long.

568
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:38,528
'But I have lived so long
it's as if death had forgotten me.

569
01:10:38,639 --> 01:10:41,233
'It goes to show you never can tell.

570
01:10:43,144 --> 01:10:47,945
'The longer I live,
the more I do not understand...

571
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:55,318
'... and what I understand least
is why I have lived to this age. '

572
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:04,228
I wonder if Sayuri writes like this
because she fears the worst...

573
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,631
What's happened?

574
01:11:09,904 --> 01:11:15,171
What she had in high school
may be turning into a sarcoma.

575
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:20,038
I'll have to check with
the general hospital in town.

576
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:25,342
And if it is?

577
01:11:27,388 --> 01:11:31,950
It's fast-growing,
so she'd need chemotherapy.

578
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,024
It's a rare case.

579
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:41,699
Isn't this precisely
your specialty?

580
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:47,470
Well, yes...

581
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:56,140
'If you're lost, go forward. '

582
01:12:01,255 --> 01:12:06,591
In Tokyo I saw three cases
like Sayuri's.

583
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:14,024
I doubt that a doctor out here
has ever seen even one.

584
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:20,068
I phoned the hospital,
and they asked if I'd consult.

585
01:12:49,637 --> 01:12:55,439
Then you should go and work
with the attending physician.

586
01:12:58,179 --> 01:12:59,942
But can I?

587
01:13:00,281 --> 01:13:03,876
Sure you can.

588
01:13:05,486 --> 01:13:09,479
You're the only one
who can cure Sayuri.

589
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,357
You can do it.

590
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:15,661
You're a doctor.

591
01:13:17,598 --> 01:13:23,195
It'll mean some nights,
and there's the clinic here.

592
01:13:25,006 --> 01:13:26,769
Will I be OK?

593
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:28,505
Sure.

594
01:13:29,176 --> 01:13:33,943
I'll drive you in and back,
and do whatever needs doing.

595
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:38,245
You'll be fine.

596
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,437
Hello.

597
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:48,451
Your 'Letter' was very good.
I'm looking forward to next month's.

598
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:20,118
'If you were deceived by life...

599
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:25,185
'Do not grieve, or with anger burn...

01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:31,229
'Persevere in times of strife...

01:15:32,233 --> 01:15:36,192
'Have faith, for happy days return.

602
01:15:40,107 --> 01:15:43,565
'In the future lives the heart...

603
01:15:44,512 --> 01:15:49,506
'Suffer now although you may...

604
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:55,052
'Sorrow swiftly will depart...

605
01:15:56,857 --> 01:16:02,921
'You will hold this dear one day. '

606
01:16:09,036 --> 01:16:11,163
Pushkin's a great poet.

607
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:23,814
'They told me Dr Ueda
will be helping.

608
01:16:23,918 --> 01:16:28,787
'I know this will
inconvenience you, too. '

609
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:32,425
Don't worry about me.

610
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:36,085
You've got to get better fast,
go back to Amitabha Hall...

611
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:38,427
...and listen to Miss Ume.

612
01:16:41,802 --> 01:16:44,066
Are there columns written?

613
01:16:47,074 --> 01:16:48,598
Three?

614
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:54,776
Get lots of rest.

615
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:58,710
Start again
when you're all better.

616
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,557
I'll come back.

617
01:17:34,622 --> 01:17:36,487
That's my husband.

618
01:17:38,592 --> 01:17:40,059
Be right there.

619
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:42,259
I'll see you.

620
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:48,192
He's a bit young, isn't he?

621
01:17:49,236 --> 01:17:54,435
You'd think so. But he does
his homework.

622
01:17:54,608 --> 01:17:58,442
He read my articles.
That speeds things up.

623
01:17:58,946 --> 01:18:03,144
Before anything else,
a good doctor is humble.

624
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:05,411
And that he is.

625
01:18:31,412 --> 01:18:33,903
'Under the bright moon...

626
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:38,184
'Fog covers the mountainside...

627
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:41,616
'Clouds on the paddies. '

628
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:09,545
If pneumonia sets in...

629
01:19:11,051 --> 01:19:14,714
We'll just have to
watch very closely...

630
01:19:14,822 --> 01:19:19,088
...and hit it with antibiotics
the moment we see it.

631
01:19:28,268 --> 01:19:30,828
Forgive me for asking, but...

632
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:34,935
...what are you doing
in Yanaka village?

633
01:19:36,176 --> 01:19:42,706
Shouldn't you be somewhere
closer to the front lines?

634
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:50,389
Call me a drop-out if you want,
Dr Nakamura.

635
01:19:50,591 --> 01:19:52,115
I don't mind.

636
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:56,187
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

637
01:19:56,296 --> 01:20:01,427
It's all right. I don't think
there's anything wrong with it.

638
01:20:06,774 --> 01:20:13,179
In Tokyo I was always trying to be
everyone's idea of perfect...

639
01:20:13,547 --> 01:20:17,313
...and at the same time
live up to my own ideals.

640
01:20:17,918 --> 01:20:19,647
I couldn't take it.

641
01:20:21,855 --> 01:20:24,187
I shouldn't have pried.

642
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:29,228
I tend to be solitary
by nature.

643
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:34,231
I have a bad habit of testing people
to see if they're sympathetic.

644
01:20:35,235 --> 01:20:36,759
I'm sorry.

645
01:20:39,139 --> 01:20:45,669
Anyway, our job now is to
knock out Sayuri's tumour.

646
01:20:47,281 --> 01:20:48,771
Let's do that.

647
01:21:19,947 --> 01:21:23,883
It's been a while since
I've seen you writing.

648
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:31,724
I thought I'd tape Miss Ume
and play it for Sayuri.

649
01:21:31,959 --> 01:21:37,124
So I started trying to write down
what I should ask.

650
01:21:40,601 --> 01:21:43,399
Sayuri will like that.

651
01:21:45,706 --> 01:21:48,231
But it's not easy.

652
01:21:51,612 --> 01:21:54,274
Maybe I shouldn't try
to plan it...

653
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:59,685
...and just listen to what
Miss Ume has to say.

654
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:20,668
Miss Ume, I thought today
I might record your voice.

655
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:22,441
Record?

656
01:22:22,543 --> 01:22:28,709
Yeah. You talk into here, and we
can hear your voice afterwards.

657
01:22:28,816 --> 01:22:32,843
Oh, the same thing
as Sayuri uses...

658
01:22:32,953 --> 01:22:34,648
That's right.

659
01:22:35,756 --> 01:22:37,087
Listen...

660
01:22:37,724 --> 01:22:42,491
Oh, the same thing
as Sayuri uses...

661
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:47,066
I'll take what you say on this
to Sayuri.

662
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:48,930
Could you say something?

663
01:22:49,536 --> 01:22:54,769
All right, if you're going to
take it to Sayuri.

664
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:57,772
Hello. Are you well?

665
01:22:57,878 --> 01:23:00,005
Oh, no... she's sick.

666
01:23:00,547 --> 01:23:01,571
Anything.

667
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:07,643
For example, what you think is
the most important thing.

668
01:23:07,754 --> 01:23:09,949
The most important?

669
01:23:11,124 --> 01:23:13,752
Amitabha, I guess.

670
01:23:14,094 --> 01:23:19,396
Amitabha! May your name
be praised!

671
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:26,234
Heal Sayuri, please!
May your name be praised!

672
01:23:26,874 --> 01:23:29,468
Sayuri will be cured!

673
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:36,209
I'm worried sick about her,
you know.

674
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:41,878
But when I sit here
and look out over the valley...

675
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:46,159
...after a while
it brings me peace.

676
01:23:54,601 --> 01:23:58,128
You'll be fine. Hang in there.

677
01:23:59,606 --> 01:24:00,868
Hurry.

678
01:24:16,623 --> 01:24:18,284
She's hyperventilating.

679
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:20,752
Oxygen saturation falling.

680
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:25,322
Put her on the ventilator
and stabilise her breathing.

681
01:24:26,533 --> 01:24:30,663
That's our only window
to hit the pneumonia.

682
01:24:32,172 --> 01:24:35,903
We'll go to steroids
if we have to.

683
01:24:36,009 --> 01:24:37,840
Might be side effects...

684
01:24:37,945 --> 01:24:40,175
We have to keep her alive.

685
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:43,414
You'll be fine.

686
01:24:49,356 --> 01:24:50,482
Ampule...

687
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:54,488
Stop her breathing.

688
01:24:55,329 --> 01:24:56,762
Muscle relaxant.

689
01:25:39,172 --> 01:25:43,302
The pneumonia's progressing
faster than we expected.

690
01:25:44,845 --> 01:25:48,178
It's fifty-fifty right now.

691
01:25:49,016 --> 01:25:54,545
She's not giving up at all.
She's fighting back.

692
01:25:55,155 --> 01:26:00,092
We're going to work with that
and do all we can for her.

693
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:07,766
She's stable right now.
You should all get some rest.

694
01:26:22,449 --> 01:26:24,440
Tired?

695
01:26:27,421 --> 01:26:32,484
I haven't been in a touch-and-go
situation like that for a while.

696
01:26:32,759 --> 01:26:36,627
I was surprised how calm I was
once we got started.

697
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:45,331
Dr Nakamura...

698
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:54,337
Could I ask how many terminal
patients you've attended?

699
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:58,007
About 30...

700
01:26:58,752 --> 01:27:03,314
...in the four years and a bit
I've been a doctor.

701
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:13,031
I watched more than 300 go
when I was in Tokyo.

702
01:27:18,004 --> 01:27:19,938
Let's relax a bit.

703
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,144
With your permission.

704
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:40,820
The last death certificate
I signed...

705
01:27:41,528 --> 01:27:46,295
...was for a 76 year-old
taxi owner-operator.

706
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:52,329
His family hadn't arrived yet.

707
01:27:54,274 --> 01:28:03,239
I sat by his bed and watched as
his breathing got slower and weaker.

708
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:10,721
And just as he'd taken
his last breath...

709
01:28:12,592 --> 01:28:18,258
...the evening sun shone in
from between the buildings...

710
01:28:19,633 --> 01:28:25,538
...and it was like something vital
from inside me...

711
01:28:26,273 --> 01:28:29,606
...went out and rose on
those rays of light.

712
01:28:35,749 --> 01:28:38,513
This doesn't sound
very professional...

713
01:28:39,352 --> 01:28:44,585
...but I think what went
out of me...

714
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:50,062
...was my qi, my vital force.

715
01:28:56,636 --> 01:29:02,472
I was pregnant, but the baby
died in my womb.

716
01:29:08,715 --> 01:29:10,376
I'm sorry.

717
01:29:19,492 --> 01:29:25,988
They say the child
chooses its parents, don't they.

718
01:29:29,069 --> 01:29:30,536
And I...

719
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:37,939
...just wasn't chosen.

720
01:29:44,184 --> 01:29:45,708
Why?

721
01:29:48,855 --> 01:29:50,379
Why?

722
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:25,316
After that I fell apart.
I guess I'd reached my limit.

723
01:30:27,327 --> 01:30:28,760
Your limit?

724
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:38,366
Death had absorbed all
my vital energy.

725
01:30:39,105 --> 01:30:43,940
AII I could think of was death.

726
01:30:44,944 --> 01:30:47,412
I had no optimism left.

727
01:31:41,434 --> 01:31:46,371
The Department of
Psychosomatic Internal Medicine...

728
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:52,669
...diagnosed me as 'panic disorder',
a psychiatric problem.

729
01:31:57,951 --> 01:32:04,015
The main reason I came to Yanaka,
my husband's home town...

730
01:32:04,524 --> 01:32:08,790
...was to recover from that.

731
01:32:09,829 --> 01:32:14,960
You don't look sick at all.
You look fine to me.

732
01:32:18,938 --> 01:32:23,136
The problem is whether
the soul's sick or not.

733
01:32:24,477 --> 01:32:26,809
The disease might be serious...

734
01:32:27,614 --> 01:32:31,744
...but if the soul isn't sick,
neither is the person.

735
01:32:34,954 --> 01:32:36,717
Mr Koda...

736
01:32:38,758 --> 01:32:44,492
...an old teacher of my husband's
who's got terminal cancer...

737
01:32:45,565 --> 01:32:50,025
...has helped me to start
thinking this way.

738
01:32:52,138 --> 01:32:53,833
Some patients are like that.

739
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:56,841
Yes. There are people like that.

740
01:33:01,147 --> 01:33:06,483
The way you think about life
and about death...

741
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:11,588
...changes as you get older.

742
01:33:14,994 --> 01:33:16,586
Dr Nakamura...

743
01:33:18,064 --> 01:33:21,693
...what do you think a life is?

744
01:33:23,503 --> 01:33:25,494
A life?

745
01:33:27,607 --> 01:33:31,338
Well, it's something that
inevitably ends in death.

746
01:33:32,846 --> 01:33:35,076
I'm still pretty young...

747
01:33:40,153 --> 01:33:44,988
'Ruddy of face at morning,
bones at day's end. '

748
01:33:47,694 --> 01:33:52,529
Since I came out here I've started
feeling the truth of that.

749
01:33:54,133 --> 01:33:59,537
A good death is part
of a good life.

750
01:34:02,942 --> 01:34:04,409
Oh, dear...

751
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:07,370
I sound just like my husband!

752
01:34:13,386 --> 01:34:14,978
I'll go this time.

753
01:34:16,089 --> 01:34:18,353
We'll take turns.

754
01:34:19,959 --> 01:34:21,221
Thanks.

755
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:49,742
Did you sleep?

756
01:35:51,384 --> 01:35:53,181
I napped.

757
01:35:55,321 --> 01:36:01,317
I can still sit up all night
with a patient.

758
01:36:02,996 --> 01:36:04,896
I guess I'm OK.

759
01:36:09,168 --> 01:36:14,970
It looks like it might work out.
The pneumonia's peaked.

760
01:36:18,645 --> 01:36:21,045
You'll make one tough old lady.

761
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:27,586
Miss Ume's my role model.

762
01:36:39,065 --> 01:36:41,033
'Praise to Amitabha!'

763
01:36:44,237 --> 01:36:45,568
Miss Ume...

764
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:51,374
Hello! Pull up a pillow!

765
01:36:53,579 --> 01:36:56,980
Sayuri's operation
was a success.

766
01:36:57,083 --> 01:36:58,778
She'll be fine.

767
01:36:59,352 --> 01:37:02,810
She'll be fine? Sayuri's better?

768
01:37:02,922 --> 01:37:03,980
Yes.

769
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:06,255
Really?

770
01:37:06,859 --> 01:37:09,760
She's better, Amitabha!

771
01:37:09,862 --> 01:37:13,195
Thank you! Praise Amitabha!

772
01:37:14,133 --> 01:37:17,694
That's wonderful! She's better!

773
01:37:18,705 --> 01:37:21,299
Say thank you to your wife.

774
01:37:21,407 --> 01:37:26,572
Say thank you for curing her.

775
01:37:26,679 --> 01:37:28,340
Say that for me.

776
01:37:28,448 --> 01:37:30,473
All right, I will.

777
01:37:30,717 --> 01:37:32,116
Wait, wait...

778
01:37:32,885 --> 01:37:38,084
You don't get many women
who are smart and sweet.

779
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:40,819
You take good care of her!

780
01:37:58,144 --> 01:38:00,305
Look at that!

781
01:38:01,147 --> 01:38:03,012
Isn't it beautiful!

782
01:38:04,517 --> 01:38:05,745
All the way to the mountains...

783
01:38:05,852 --> 01:38:07,376
Let's go this way.

784
01:38:11,557 --> 01:38:13,548
It's a good rice crop.

785
01:38:13,993 --> 01:38:15,460
Look at it all!

786
01:38:18,197 --> 01:38:19,755
Wow!

787
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,562
Next year I'll plant
my own field.

788
01:38:23,936 --> 01:38:25,733
Yes...

789
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:30,474
This looks so good!

790
01:38:30,576 --> 01:38:33,170
And here, too.

791
01:39:12,585 --> 01:39:17,022
Takao, let's stop for lunch.

792
01:39:20,526 --> 01:39:24,121
Next year I'm going to
plant my own field.

793
01:39:24,230 --> 01:39:29,167
Yes! Don't be a cherry-blossom
farmer all your life.

794
01:39:52,692 --> 01:39:55,126
I'll go see Dr Nakamura.

795
01:39:55,461 --> 01:39:56,723
Good morning.

796
01:40:03,536 --> 01:40:05,060
Hello.

797
01:40:07,306 --> 01:40:08,295
Good, huh?

798
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:30,055
'I've listened to...

799
01:40:31,864 --> 01:40:33,661
'...Miss Ume's...

800
01:40:36,035 --> 01:40:37,696
'... tape...

801
01:40:39,906 --> 01:40:41,703
'... again and again.

802
01:40:44,143 --> 01:40:48,739
'It's made me feel...

803
01:40:49,682 --> 01:40:52,549
'... very calm. '

804
01:40:59,358 --> 01:41:00,950
When Miss Ume...

805
01:41:02,461 --> 01:41:06,625
...heard that you were
going to be all right...

806
01:41:08,267 --> 01:41:11,259
...she started crying.

807
01:41:34,927 --> 01:41:38,693
Thank you.

808
01:44:25,364 --> 01:44:27,093
Does it hurt?

809
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,427
No.

810
01:44:55,261 --> 01:45:00,198
'Mother'... I don't want
a funeral.

811
01:45:01,767 --> 01:45:05,168
A stick of incense
will be enough.

812
01:45:06,839 --> 01:45:10,536
Otherwise just go on
as usual.

813
01:45:11,544 --> 01:45:14,945
Yes, I know.

814
01:45:18,017 --> 01:45:24,013
You've been wonderful to me
all these years.

815
01:45:29,828 --> 01:45:31,557
I can't stand this!

816
01:45:58,924 --> 01:46:01,222
I love that sound.

817
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:35,049
Beautiful!

818
01:47:09,094 --> 01:47:10,527
The smoke?

819
01:47:10,629 --> 01:47:16,363
My eye! There's some ash
in my eye, Doctor!

820
01:47:16,468 --> 01:47:18,197
There is? Where?

821
01:47:20,072 --> 01:47:21,539
There you go!

822
01:47:32,484 --> 01:47:33,849
Good evening!

823
01:47:37,723 --> 01:47:40,191
Oh, good evening.

824
01:47:41,427 --> 01:47:43,327
Please, come in.

825
01:47:43,429 --> 01:47:44,293
It's late. I'm sorry.

826
01:47:44,396 --> 01:47:46,227
No trouble.

827
01:47:49,368 --> 01:47:52,337
Thank you for all you've done.

828
01:47:52,438 --> 01:47:53,769
Not at all.

829
01:47:54,573 --> 01:47:56,541
This is just a token...

830
01:47:56,642 --> 01:47:59,509
Oh, thank you.

831
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:04,142
Sayuri fought very hard.

832
01:48:04,249 --> 01:48:09,312
It was because of you.
I don't know what to say.

833
01:48:09,555 --> 01:48:11,750
Thank you very much.

834
01:48:14,259 --> 01:48:15,521
Have some tea.

835
01:48:16,762 --> 01:48:18,457
Please.

836
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:27,334
Tonight the council adopted
plans for a new clinic.

837
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:32,299
The village wants to take it
out of the nursery school...

838
01:48:32,411 --> 01:48:35,744
...and put it in its own building.

839
01:48:36,081 --> 01:48:40,484
Time being of the essence,
the Mayor's asked me to come...

840
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:47,086
...and ask if you'd take charge of
the clinic on a full-time basis.

841
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:54,965
I'll give it serious thought.

842
01:48:56,668 --> 01:49:00,468
But rather than
a fancy building...

843
01:49:00,806 --> 01:49:04,640
...I think you should
start by thinking...

844
01:49:04,743 --> 01:49:09,544
...what kind of care people want,
and what makes them comfortable.

845
01:49:10,449 --> 01:49:15,045
We'll certainly be happy
for any advice you can give us.

846
01:49:15,687 --> 01:49:21,057
May I assume you'll take part
in the planning process, then?

847
01:49:22,461 --> 01:49:27,421
Of course I will. When do you
expect to have it built?

848
01:49:27,533 --> 01:49:30,764
We hope to have it finished
by next autumn.

849
01:49:30,869 --> 01:49:34,532
You could go full-time
from then, if you like.

850
01:49:35,174 --> 01:49:39,634
The Mayor will be delighted.
I'd better go tell him.

851
01:49:40,846 --> 01:49:45,545
He's at the Village Hall. He was
going to come if you'd said no to me.

852
01:49:46,552 --> 01:49:47,814
Excuse me.

853
01:49:53,926 --> 01:49:55,723
Thank you very much.

854
01:49:55,828 --> 01:49:57,227
Thank you.

855
01:50:02,768 --> 01:50:04,099
Good night.

856
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:13,109
Will you do it?

857
01:50:16,548 --> 01:50:17,674
Sure.

858
01:50:20,252 --> 01:50:24,188
A woman does
what she's asked.

859
01:51:13,038 --> 01:51:17,099
Takao and Michiko are here.

860
01:51:20,712 --> 01:51:22,009
Sensei...

861
01:51:28,053 --> 01:51:31,511
This is the best way.

862
01:51:35,761 --> 01:51:38,093
Will you be all right?

863
01:51:40,799 --> 01:51:42,790
I'll be fine.

864
01:51:43,869 --> 01:51:47,805
I'll go on ahead, then.

865
01:51:48,974 --> 01:51:50,236
All right.

866
01:51:52,611 --> 01:51:55,102
I won't keep you waiting long.

867
01:53:38,283 --> 01:53:43,687
It's almost as if Mr Koda
willed himself to stop breathing.

868
02:45:43,662 --> 02:45:45,459
You're back!

869
02:45:48,133 --> 02:45:52,194
That's wonderful!

870
02:45:52,938 --> 02:45:55,873
Thank you! Thank you!

871
02:45:56,575 --> 02:45:58,338
Wonderful!

872
02:46:48,727 --> 02:46:51,855
It's positive.

873
02:46:52,865 --> 02:46:54,628
Three months.

874
02:46:59,371 --> 02:47:03,000
A baby! I'm pregnant!

875
02:47:03,842 --> 02:47:08,279
I'm 43 and I'm pregnant!

876
02:47:11,350 --> 02:47:13,011
Yeah?

877
02:47:18,156 --> 02:47:19,680
You are?

878
02:50:37,286 --> 02:50:39,311
'Letter from the Mountain.:

879
02:50:40,789 --> 02:50:44,953
'Snow erases the boundary

OK, smile!

894
02:51:45,621 --> 02:51:47,316
Here goes!

895
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:52,952
Change places.

896
02:52:01,270 --> 02:52:02,464
Careful...

897
02:52:03,906 --> 02:52:04,998
Thanks.

898
02:52:05,107 --> 02:52:07,166
OK, Miss Ume...

899
02:52:11,480 --> 02:52:13,914
You say 'cheese'!

900
02:52:14,516 --> 02:52:16,108
Cheese!

901
02:52:20,088 --> 02:52:21,282
One more for good luck.

902
02:52:21,390 --> 02:52:22,914
One more?

903
02:52:24,359 --> 02:52:25,587
Miss Ume...
