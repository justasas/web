1
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,979
Suzy Bannion decided to
perfect her ballet studies...

2
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,815
In the most famous school of dance in Europe.

3
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,619
She chose the celebrated academy of Freiburg.

4
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:56,489
One day at 9:00 in the morning,
She left Kennedy airport, New york,

5
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,293
And arrived in Germany at
10:40 p.m. Local time.

6
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,880
Taxi!

7
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,384
Taxi, taxi!

8
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,755
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

9
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:51,654
Taxi! Taxi!

10
00:02:54,657 --> 00:02:56,659
Can you give me a hand?

11
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,680
Uh, Escherstrausse.

12
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,934
-Was?
-Escherstrausse.

13
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,936
Was?

14
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,943
Ah, Escherstrausse.

15
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,312
Ja, ja.

16
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,000
Has it been raining this hard for long?

17
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,258
Half an hour.

18
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,945
Can you wait a minute, please?

19
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,717
-Hello?
-Who is it?

20
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:11,220
Suzy Bannion. I just got in from New York.

21
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,724
-I don't know you. Go away!
-But I have the letter you sent.

22
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:18,227
Look, it's really raining hard. You
could just let me in and I'll explain.

23
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:20,730
-Go away. Go away!
-But you don't understand!

24
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:26,736
Wait! Wait a minute. Wait.

25
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,241
Hello. Is anybody there?

26
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,243
Hello?

27
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:56,576
If you're happy enough with the couch,
you can stay for as long as you please.

28
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,079
Thanks, but I'll be leaving in the morning.

29
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,082
-I'm going away forever.
-Oh, big deal, kid.

30
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,585
So what if you've been thrown out of school?

31
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,589
I always got kicked out of school,
beginning in kindergarten.

32
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,092
No, that's not it. I don't give a
damn about getting kicked out.

33
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:15,344
Well, then?

34
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:17,847
It's useless to try and explain it to you.

35
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,849
You wouldn't understand.

36
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,351
It all seems so...Absurd,

37
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,353
So fantastic.

38
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:30,243
All I can do is get away from
here as soon as possible.

39
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,362
Would you mind if I used the
bathroom? I'd like to dry off.

40
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,748
No, of course not. Go ahead.

41
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,773
Hey, why don't you close it?

42
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,779
That's better. It was just the wind.

43
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,783
You sure are in bad shape.

44
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,153
You have to tell me all about it.

45
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:18,157
The wind! The windows burst open.

46
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,661
-I got scared.
-No. That's not it.

47
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,164
I mean, what it is that's got you so upset.

48
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,171
Okay, you can tell me about it later.

49
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:53,612
Let me in! Pat!

50
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:58,367
Pat! Pat!

51
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:06,492
Help me! Help me!
There's a murderer!

52
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:13,132
Help me! Help!
There's a murderer!

53
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,508
Help me! Help!

54
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,894
No! No! No!

55
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,776
Help me!

56
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:51,754
Help!

57
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,011
There's a murderer!

58
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:22,902
No!

59
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:18,934
Good morning. Good morning, Daniel.

60
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,936
Good morning, miss Tanner.

61
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,825
-Good morning. May I help you?
-Yes, I'm Suzy Bannion.

62
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,828
We expected you yesterday evening.
You wrote us that--

63
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,331
Right. I did arrive
last night about 10:00.

64
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,334
But the door was locked,
and somebody on the call box...

65
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,836
Said they didn't know who
I was and couldn't let me in.

66
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,340
-Who said that to you?
-I don't know. She didn't say her name.

67
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,343
I'm so sorry. At any rate,
Now you're here among us,

68
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:48,847
So welcome to our academy. I'm miss
Tanner, one of the instructors.

69
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,849
Nice to meet you.

70
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,852
Come along. I'd like to
introduce you to madame Blanc,

71
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,854
Our vice directress.

72
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,856
She was a very famous ballerina.

73
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,858
-Madame Blanc?
-Yes?

74
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,228
Suzy Bannion, our new student.

75
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,980
Oh, yes.

76
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,868
-Excuse me, gentlemen.
-Of course, madame.

77
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:15,874
You're pretty. Very pretty
indeed. They're policemen.

78
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:20,379
I knew a woman called Bannion years
ago in New York. Carol Bannion.

79
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,382
-She's my aunt.
-Good! She's a marvelous woman,

80
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,884
A friend and benefactress
of artists everywhere.

81
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:29,388
I'm delighted to have her niece here.

82
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:32,508
Well, I offer our academy's official
welcome in the name of our directress,

83
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,010
Who unfortunately is not
here at the moment.

84
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,513
-She's traveling abroad.
-Thank you.

85
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:41,517
Albert, please wait for me upstairs.

86
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:44,520
He's my nephew. I'm very attached to him.

87
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,522
I must tell you what I
have to say very quickly...

88
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:49,024
Because those gentlemen
are waiting for me.

89
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:52,027
Something terrible, truly
horrible, has happened.

90
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:57,032
One of our students, Pat Hingle, who was
expelled just yesterday for improper conduct,

91
00:16:57,032 --> 00:17:01,286
Was murdered last night by some
madman. It's a frightening story.

92
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,789
But I always warn our students,
Don't I, miss Tanner?

93
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,291
I tell them to be careful, not to get
involved with questionable friendships.

94
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:10,295
What I wanted to tell you was that
your room here isn't free yet.

95
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,297
-Just a slight hitch.
-Yes, but don't worry.

96
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,802
We've found you a place to stay with one of
our third-year students who lives in town.

97
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,305
You'll have to pay 50 of your
American dollars a week,

98
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,308
But it's a good price, and you can
deduct it from your fee here.

99
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,812
Now I entrust you to the care of miss Tanner,
one of our veteran teachers here.

100
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:32,818
Don't be upset if she seems a little
stern or surly. It's only her manner.
She's even that way with me.

101
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,821
She really is an invaluable teacher.

102
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:40,209
-Come with me.
-And now, gentlemen--

103
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,462
As you know, our courses last three years,

104
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,964
And you must pass an exam
at the end of each year.

105
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,967
So, the girl left the school
About 11:00 in the evening?

106
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,971
-That's my information.
-Excuse me.

107
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:56,475
When I got here last night about 11:00,
I saw a girl leaving the school.

108
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,978
She's a new student. She just
arrived. What did she look like?

109
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,982
Well, she had blonde hair and
was wearing a brown raincoat.

110
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,487
-What did she do?
-I don't know. I only saw her
for a minute in a storm.

111
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,490
So you see? It really was 11:00.

112
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,493
Coming?

113
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:19,498
We don't teach you how to dance here,
because we presume our students already know how.

114
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:23,502
This is an established academy
dedicated to specializing.

115
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,505
This is Pavlos, our general handyman.

116
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,258
He's really ugly, isn't he?
don't be afraid to say so.

117
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:32,127
He can't understand you, anyway.
He speaks only Romanian.

118
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:36,632
You see that gorgeous smile? He's been very
handsome ever since he got those false teeth.

119
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,639
Last year, he discovered He
had gingivitis of the gums,

120
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:46,141
So he had all his teeth pulled.

121
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:49,144
The top row one morning.
The bottom row a day later.

122
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,146
Bang.

123
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,649
-Where are we going?
-To the locker room.

124
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:57,152
We also have a swimming pool,
which you can use when you want.

125
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:05,077
Miss Tanner. I have something to tell you.

126
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,080
-Squawk, squawk. Polly parrot.
-Who said that? Shut up.

127
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,582
That's enough of these little
games for the moment.

128
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,586
I want to introduce Suzy Bannion, our new student.

129
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:18,590
You'll find several fellow Americans
among these girls--Miriam, for one.

130
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,593
-Hello.
-Hi.
-Your locker's over there.

131
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,096
You'll find everything in there except shoes.

132
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:28,100
For today, you can borrow shoes
from someone who has two pairs.

133
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,104
Hurry up, everybody. I'll be waiting
for all of you in the red room.

134
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,107
Come with me.

135
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,119
Mata Hari is going to file her report.

136
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,625
My name is Olga, and you're my tenant.

137
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,627
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

138
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,630
They tell me you have to give me $50 a week.

139
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,133
-Yeah.
-In advance.

140
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,635
Well, don't worry. If you think I'm not--Oh--

141
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:07,639
Don't get hot under the collar.
That's how people are here.

142
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,644
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?

143
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,647
-Yes. Me.
-Oh, thank you.

144
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,650
If you want to buy them, I can make
you a nice price. Fifteen marks.

145
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,653
Oh, no, thanks. I already have some in my suitcase.

146
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,655
I just need a pair for today.

147
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,657
But if you'd rather not--

148
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,660
No. Okay. Go ahead. Take them.

149
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,663
-But, uh, Give them back, hmm?
-Of course.

150
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,670
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

151
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,672
Oh, it's okay. It doesn't matter.

152
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,680
Did they shake you up with all
that talk about money?

153
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,682
Well, I'm not exactly used to it.

154
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,185
Same with me at first.

155
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,687
Then I found out it's a
charming habit around here.

156
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,196
I once read that names...

157
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,699
Which begin With the letter "S"...

158
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,202
Are the names of snakes.

159
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,343
Next year, after I finish the course,

160
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,346
I've got an offer from the
state school of ballet in Geneva.

161
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,349
What about you?

162
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,353
Well, I'll go back to yhe states,
but I'm not exactly sure what I'll do.

163
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,857
Hey, thanks.
My room is really pretty.

164
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,859
-Like it?
-Uh-huh.

165
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,363
That makes me happy. I bet we'll do
nicely together. I think you're sweet.

166
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,365
Even if I have the name of a snake?

167
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,367
I was just kidding.

168
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,870
Don't tell me you're as touchy as Sara.

169
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,372
No.

170
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,378
Hello?

171
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,381
Oh, hi! No, no, no.

172
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,383
You did the right thing.

173
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,887
-Hi.
-Hi.

174
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:04,139
Oh, you didn't have to bring these over here.

175
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:06,641
I could've picked them up myself tomorrow.

176
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:09,144
I thought you might be needing them.

177
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,146
Yes, but it really wasn't necessary.

178
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:15,650
-Anyway, thanks a lot.
-Oh, no. It's nothing.

179
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:18,153
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

180
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:21,156
-Don't you want to stay for a while?
-No, thanks. I can't.

181
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:25,160
I live at the school, so I've got to
be back for supper in half an hour.

182
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,162
-I have to.
-Just for a minute?

183
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:29,664
No, no, really. I have to be going.

184
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:32,667
They get very upset if you
show up late for supper.

185
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:37,172
-Okay, sunday. No, not before lunchtime.
-Well, ciao.

186
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:39,674
See you tomorrow.

187
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:41,676
Bye.

188
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,678
No, go on.

189
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,682
Uh-huh, I know.

190
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:51,686
You caught one. Yes, yes, I can
hear you very well.

191
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:53,688
Didn't you see how he was blushing?

192
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:56,691
He's cute, except he doesn't have any, um--

193
00:22:56,691 --> 00:23:00,195
And he never has enough money
for room and board at school.

194
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,697
That's why that bitch Tanner
has got him under her thumb.

195
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:05,200
She gives him 1,001 errands to do.

196
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,203
Sure.

197
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,205
I got it. Okay.

198
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:13,208
Call me back tomorrow evening.
Give me a chance to think it over.

199
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,577
Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

200
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:18,080
Anyway, he is cute.

201
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,083
Poor Pat. She liked him a lot.

202
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:25,087
That poor kid, ending up like that.

203
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:27,589
I can't even think about it.

204
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,092
I heard you saw her yesterday evening.

205
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:33,095
Uh-huh. Outside the school.

206
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,597
She was acting very strange.

207
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:37,599
Mumbling to herself.

208
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,238
She really felt terrible when they kicked
her out, but she really deserved it.

209
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:48,243
-There was so much noise.
-God, was she difficult.

210
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:50,745
She was saying things that made no sense.

211
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:54,249
She was always arguing, causing trouble.

212
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,502
"Secret."

213
00:23:57,752 --> 00:24:00,255
"Iris."

214
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:01,756
What?

215
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,261
Uh, I remember...

216
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:08,263
She mentioned the word "secret."

217
00:24:08,763 --> 00:24:12,267
And then she...Mentioned a flower--

218
00:24:12,267 --> 00:24:14,269
Iris, I think, or a lilac.

219
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:16,771
Secret flowers? What's
that supposed to mean?

220
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:19,774
I don't know. She was a busybody.

221
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:23,778
It would've been easy for her to
find out one of us was in a jam.

222
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,728
-How do you like it at Olga's?
-It's nice.

223
00:24:56,728 --> 00:25:00,732
Those eight on the list this morning,
come with me to the yellow room.

224
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,738
Good morning, miss Tanner. Suzy.

225
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,741
-Good morning, madame Blanc.
-I've got good news for you.

226
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,744
We have it all arranged.
Your room is ready for you.

227
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,747
Isn't that marvelous? You can
move in today, if you like.

228
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,250
But I'd rather stay at Olga's, if it's okay.

229
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,752
Doesn't matter to me, my dear,

230
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,755
But in your letter of enrollment, you
said you'd be boarding at the school.

231
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,758
-I know, but--
-The room is free now.

232
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:30,262
-Well, I didn't think it was so important.
-As you wish.

233
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,764
If that's what you want, so be it.

234
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,279
Sara?

235
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:53,285
I had no idea you were so strong-willed.

236
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,288
I see that when you make up
your mind about something,

237
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,790
Nothing will change it for you.

238
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,792
My compliments.

239
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,336
Witch!

240
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,763
And then, toward the end of the 19th century,

241
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,766
The technique of classical ballet...

242
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:51,269
Assumed a different, more stylized impostation.

243
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:55,273
All right. Let's warm up.

244
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,276
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

245
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:01,780
No, it's nothing. I just feel a little weak.

246
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,282
If it gets any worse, I'll just stop.

247
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,284
And now some exercises.

248
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,287
Daniel, you may begin.

249
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:18,430
One, two, three and four.

250
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,932
And one and two...

251
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,435
And three and four.

252
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,053
And one and two...

253
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:27,055
And three and four.

254
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:29,057
-And one--
-I'm sorry, miss Tanner.

255
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:32,560
I feel a little weak. Can I
just rest for a second?

256
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,814
Weak? Come on. It's an easy step.

257
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,316
This is the first time we've worked together.

258
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,319
I want to see what you can do,
how far along you are.

259
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,323
Now, come along and join the others.
Come on; let's go.

260
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:48,076
Daniel?

261
00:28:48,076 --> 00:28:51,079
All together now.

262
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:56,084
And one and two...

263
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:59,087
And three and four.

264
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:03,591
-I can't. Please.
-And one and two...

265
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,593
And three and four.

266
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:11,099
And one and two and three and four.

267
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:15,353
And one and two and three and four.

268
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,607
Pay attention, Suzy. Get those legs
up higher. You're not paralyzed.

269
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:25,997
Get those legs up higher.
And one and two and three and--

270
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,117
Pay attention, Suzy. And one and two...

271
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:31,619
And three and four.

272
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:35,623
And one and two and three and four.

273
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,790
Come on. Come on. Run along.

274
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,292
Come on. Drink up.

275
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:14,295
-Oh, you--You must drink.
-No, that's enough.

276
00:30:14,295 --> 00:30:16,798
You heard what the doctor said.

277
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:19,300
-Drink up.
-No.

278
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,302
You must drink.

279
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,422
The blood that was hemorrhaging is
going back with the intake of liquids.

280
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:28,426
-Right, professor Verdegast?
-Obviously.

281
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,929
My dear madame.

282
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,933
Do not be concerned. It's nothing,
as I've already told the young lady.

283
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,936
That's a relief, professor.
How do you feel, dear?

284
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,939
-Uh, better.
-The fault lies with your exercises.

285
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:46,444
When somebody's been out of practice,
violent movement could cause tiny
tears in internal ligaments.

286
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,446
Thus the hemorrhaging.

287
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:52,450
You look better already. You've
even got color back in your cheeks.

288
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,452
-Isn't that right?
-Oh, yes. She looks much better.

289
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,454
-Ow!
-Hold still.

290
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,958
This will get you back into shape in no time.

291
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:05,964
Here we are. Fine, fine. A day or two,
you'll be on your feet, as good as new.

292
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,971
-Who brought my bags here?
-Olga. What a dear.

293
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,974
The minute she heard you were ill, she
went right home and brought your things.

294
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,978
Oh, and she also left me your $50,
and she didn't take a penny of it.

295
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,981
Why--Why did she do that?

296
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,984
-If I wanted to, I would--
-Well, my dear,

297
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,987
What you need now is
some peace and quiet.

298
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,490
If the hemorrhaging should start
again, which is very improbable,

299
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,993
You can telephone me.

300
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,496
And Tanner, she is to eat
bland food for about a week.

301
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,999
And you mustn't let
her have any fruit.

302
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,501
-A drop of vin rose?
-Yes.

303
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:47,005
Good. A glass of red wine with
each meal. It works miracles.

304
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,508
Clears up anemia and strengthens
red corpuscles. It builds the blood.

305
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,512
Rest well. You're in good hands.

306
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:21,789
Suzy, we're next-door neighbors.

307
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:24,792
So, you moved in here.

308
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,795
Well, they moved me in here.

309
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:29,797
I really didn't want to.

310
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:33,301
You know, as soon as I got sick,
your pal Olga ran and got my bags...

311
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:35,303
And threw me out of her place.

312
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:38,806
She must've thought I had
something awfully contagious.

313
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:43,811
But I can't stand to live in a
boarding school like a ten-year-old.

314
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:46,814
Oh, wow. You come back strong.

315
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:49,317
Yeah, you know, I feel really well.

316
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:52,820
I mean, it's almost as if nothing
had happened. It's incredible.

317
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,324
-And all thanks to professor Verdegast.
-Verdegast?

318
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:58,326
-He came to look at you?
-Yeah.

319
00:32:58,326 --> 00:33:00,828
Come in.

320
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:05,333
Hi, Pavlos.

321
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,229
Thank you.

322
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,234
You'd better keep an eye on that
lighter. He really likes it.

323
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,236
Yes, but I don't think he's a thief.

324
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,238
At least you know.

325
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:31,242
-Are you eating up here?
-Yeah, they put me on a restricted diet.

326
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:34,245
And on a restricted diet, they give you wine?

327
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:38,249
That's professor Verdegast's idea.
Says it'll build up my blood.

328
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,625
The bell. Oh, god. That means
it's only 15 minutes till supper.

329
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,128
I'd better change.

330
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,131
-Ciao. See you later.
-Okay.

331
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,723
Where? Where?

332
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,725
Everywhere. The whole floor.

333
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,728
It's disgusting! It's disgusting!

334
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,231
-Where are they coming from?
-I don't know! Let's go and see!

335
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,734
-They're coming from the ceiling.
-In the meantime, everybody downstairs.

336
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,883
Don't let anyone come up.

337
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:51,475
I'm sorry. Truly mortified.
Please excuse me.

338
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,477
But it was nothing to do
with you, madame.

339
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,480
No, of course not, girls.
It was not madame Blanc's fault.

340
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,233
We ordered those cases
of food by mail...

341
00:36:59,734 --> 00:37:01,736
From a reliable firm that
we thought to be honest.

342
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,621
Obviously, It arrived spoiled.

343
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,123
In a few days' time,
you see what happened.

344
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,876
-Oh, it was awful.
-Yes, one got in my mouth.

345
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:12,880
I suppose we're fortunate those things
only reached the floor below the attic.

346
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,883
-Are the other floors all right?
-Yes. We checked them out.

347
00:37:15,883 --> 00:37:17,885
Just the floor where the
students' rooms are.

348
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:20,888
Well, I'll take care of the problem
of fumigating in the morning.

349
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:24,392
In the meantime, for tonight, I've
thought of a makeshift arrangement.

350
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:26,894
Go and see how they're getting
along, will you, dear?

351
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,898
The boys have kindly offered to help,

352
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:33,401
And they and the servants are turning
the practice hall into a dormitory.

353
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,405
If some of you choose to find hotel
rooms, I'll have no objections.

354
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:39,407
But it's already late,
and in any case,

355
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,409
The inconvenience will only
be for one night.

356
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,778
We'll all sleep together.

357
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:47,281
-Bravo.
-You all right?

358
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,784
-Yes, thank you.
-Fine.

359
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:52,286
-Is everything all right?
-Yes, thank you.

360
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:54,288
-Good.
-Are you all right?

361
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,290
Yes, madame Blanc. Thank you.

362
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,293
-Oh, it's very comfortable. Just like being in camp.
-Good.

363
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,796
Are you sleeping here with
us, too, Madame Blanc?

364
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:04,298
Certainly, as are all the other
teachers and miss Tanner.

365
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:07,301
Do the teachers live here at school?

366
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:09,303
No, they live in town.

367
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:12,807
They leave after supper at
9:30, just like clockwork.

368
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,942
It's very late. You won't be afraid
if I turn out the lights?

369
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:17,945
-Good night, everyone.
-Good night. Good night.

370
00:38:57,184 --> 00:38:59,687
Is that guy hot for you?

371
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:01,639
-Maybe.
-That's funny.

372
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,542
I heard he was, uh--

373
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:10,114
-Of course, I'm not much of a gossip.
-That's a good one.

374
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:12,666
Come on. You tried to get
him and didn't make it.

375
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,652
-You liar! That's not--
-Why don't you two shut up?

376
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,204
Some of us want to go to sleep.

377
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:25,713
Hey, Sara. Forget it. It's okay.

378
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,130
Suzy, are you asleep?

379
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,849
-Were you sleeping?
-No. What's the matter?

380
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,003
You hear that snoring?

381
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:58,856
It's weird.

382
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,759
Hear it?

383
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,111
Where do you think it's coming from?

384
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:13,787
Behind the sheet.

385
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:16,323
Lies!

386
00:41:16,323 --> 00:41:18,375
What?

387
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,881
They lied to us.

388
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,383
The directress is here.

389
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:29,887
That's her, the one who's snoring.

390
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,389
She's the directress.

391
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,875
-How do you know?
-I'm sure it's her.

392
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:40,214
Last year, for a while,

393
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:42,333
I lived in one of the guest rooms...

394
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,485
Under the top of the stairs.

395
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:50,007
One night,

396
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,777
I heard someone coming very late in,

397
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,914
Getting into bed in the room next to mine.

398
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,084
And then--

399
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,704
Then I heard this weird kind of snoring.

400
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:07,258
I tell you, it was so weird
I never forgot it.

401
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:12,296
Listen.

402
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,848
You hear that whistle?

403
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:19,036
It's exactly the same.

404
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,023
The next morning, madame Blanc told me...

405
00:42:23,023 --> 00:42:25,526
That the directress had spent
a few hours at the school...

406
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:28,562
And had slept in the room next to mine.

407
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,700
You see?

408
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:36,787
So I know she's the directress.

409
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,822
She's here.

410
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,994
She's there.

411
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,064
Right behind that sheet.

412
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,356
Thank you. I'm grateful you can take
care of the fumigating so promptly.

413
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,359
-Good morning, madame Blanc.
-Good morning, Daniel.

414
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,862
-Is everything in order now?
-All cleaned up, madame.

415
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:21,365
Just to be sure, we checked
the other floors too.

416
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,371
Miss Tanner. Excuse me.

417
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,373
Did the directress sleep
here last night?

418
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,376
-No, she didn't. Good morning, Daniel.
-Good morning.

419
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:36,880
You know she's away on a trip. Maybe
she'll pay us a visit two weeks from now.

420
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,384
Excuse me, miss Tanner, But which
class do I attend this morning?

421
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,386
The second-year class in the red room.

422
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,388
Thank you.

423
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:45,699
Stop!

424
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:48,702
Stop! Stop!

425
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:51,705
Enough. Enough!

426
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:54,708
-Do you know what happened? Do you know?
-What day is it?

427
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:58,212
Your lousy, disgusting
dog has bitten Albert!

428
00:44:58,212 --> 00:45:00,214
He took a piece out
of Albert's arm.

429
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:03,217
-What?
-Did you all hear that?

430
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:06,220
That miserable dog tried
to mutilate a child.

431
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,224
Madame Blanc had to rush Albert to
a first-aid center to have stitches put in!

432
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:13,727
-That's impossible.
-Let's go to the first-aid center.

433
00:45:14,228 --> 00:45:17,231
Even if you can't see the blood, at least
you can hear the poor child's crying.

434
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:19,233
That's enough now!

435
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:23,237
My dog's a peaceful, faithful
animal. He's never hurt anyone.

436
00:45:23,237 --> 00:45:25,739
The boy must have done
something to him first!

437
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:29,243
Oh, the poor little animal!
The poor little puppy!

438
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:33,747
If I ever see him within a mile of this
school again, I'll have him put to death!

439
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,749
Stop it!

440
00:45:35,749 --> 00:45:37,751
I won't allow such talk, you understand?

441
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:40,754
You won't allow it?

442
00:45:40,754 --> 00:45:43,257
Then get out! You and your dog!

443
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:46,760
-Get moving!
-You bitch!

444
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,762
Out!

445
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:51,765
I'm going. I'm going.

446
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:54,268
But try to understand that--

447
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:58,272
That I'm blind, not deaf.

448
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:00,774
Get it? Huh?

449
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:02,776
Not deaf.

450
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,529
Not deaf. You understand that?

451
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,531
You understand?

452
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:13,036
Ahh, fresh air!

453
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,539
Let me out of this gilded parade.

454
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,043
Get out! Get out of here! Good riddance!

455
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,551
Oh, Pavlos, how much longer
do I have to eat like this?

456
00:46:51,658 --> 00:46:54,161
Hey, listen.

457
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:58,165
There they go, right on schedule.

458
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:00,667
The teachers. Remember?

459
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:05,672
Can you hear them?
They're going away.

460
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:11,678
You hear them?

461
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,682
Yes.

462
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,322
I--

463
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:35,836
I--I don't think they'll
even miss school.

464
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:38,839
What? What did you say?

465
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:41,341
Wake up.

466
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:45,846
I said, it doesn't seem to
me that they're going out.

467
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:49,850
A front door is on the left.

468
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:54,855
Their footsteps are going to the
right, somewhere inside the school.

469
00:47:56,356 --> 00:47:59,359
Jesus, Suzy.

470
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,396
-You're a genius.
-Mmm.

471
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:03,864
Fantastic.

472
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:07,317
How come I never noticed that before?

473
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:12,322
Suzy. If they don't leave,
Where do they go?

474
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,825
Wake up. Suzy.

475
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:19,630
Come on. Wake up. Suzy!

476
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,634
I'm so sleepy.

477
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,636
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

478
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,639
Maybe--

479
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,141
Maybe we can find out where they really go.

480
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:37,147
Of course!
Yes.

481
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,654
Begin to count the steps as they go.

482
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,923
It's like the search of alietne.

483
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,331
Easy.

484
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,835
What is it? Huh?

485
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:36,837
Come on.

486
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:40,340
Come on; let's go home.

487
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,615
Who is that? Who's there?

488
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,252
Easy, boy.

489
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,760
What is it?

490
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,381
What's happening?

491
00:53:26,019 --> 00:53:28,521
Who's there?

492
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,478
Who's there?

493
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,628
Wait!

494
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:51,031
Poor Daniel. Torn to pieces. Incredible.

495
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:54,034
Oh, yeah, but you can never put
too much trust in wolfhounds.

496
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:57,537
They're crazy. We had two of them
once at the villa in Gestaad.

497
00:55:57,537 --> 00:56:00,540
My god. First Pat gets
murdered by a madman,

498
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,043
And now Daniel is killed by his dog.

499
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:05,545
Yeah. Maybe there's a hex on the place.

500
00:56:06,046 --> 00:56:10,050
Yeah. Let's call in the exorcist
and have it purged.

501
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:14,554
-What is it? Is something wrong?
-No, everything's all right.

502
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,307
Is it something personal, dear?

503
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,809
No, no, it's nothing like that.

504
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,813
Miss Tanner, would you mind?

505
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,949
I'd like a few minutes
alone with Suzy.

506
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,456
Well? What is it?

507
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:37,460
I just wanted to talk to you about some of
the things that have been happening lately.

508
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,964
Oh, I know you're upset by Daniel's
death, as we all have been.

509
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:42,966
No, but it's more than that.

510
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,969
Does anybody know anything
about who killed Pat?

511
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,971
I spoke with the chief of
police just this morning.

512
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,473
He told me they had
some definite clues.

513
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,977
-You know that I saw her the night I arrived here.
-Yes, you told me that.

514
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,480
And that she was mumbling some
strange, unrelated words.

515
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:00,483
No, you didn't tell me that.

516
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:03,987
Because it was something that didn't
make any sense. It was in a thunderstorm.

517
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,990
I just didn't pay much attention to it.

518
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,993
I only caught two words distinctly:

519
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,495
"Secret" and "Irises."

520
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,999
I don't know what they mean, but
I thought they might be important.

521
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,001
You've done very well. Congratulations.

522
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:21,004
I don't know what the words
"Secret" or "Irises" mean either.

523
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,506
But I think it's only right we should
let the police know about it.

524
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:27,977
I'm only amazed you waited
two days before-- hello?

525
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,798
-You really messed things up.
-What are you talking about?

526
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:34,801
Because... Maybe Pat was talking to...

527
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:37,804
Someone just inside the building that night.

528
00:57:41,808 --> 00:57:44,310
And we know that someone
wasn't one of the teachers.

529
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,069
Come on.

530
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,074
Now you've put them
on the hunt for somebody.

531
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:01,077
What difference does that make to you?

532
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,079
Big difference.

533
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,083
Because I was Pat's friend.

534
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,086
She was telling me something
When you suddenly showed up.

535
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,590
She got scared and she ran away.

536
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,092
She was in hysterics almost.

537
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,595
And then she was killed.

538
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:22,098
Remember that voice when you rang the bell?

539
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,601
Well, that was me.

540
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:24,661
I heard strange, incredible, absurd things.

541
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,163
Pat was taking notes on them for months.

542
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:30,667
And before going away,
she gave me all the notes.

543
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:34,170
I've only told one person,
a very good friend of mine.

544
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:37,173
Frank Mandel. He's here
for a convention.

545
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,677
I'll let you read them tonight.

546
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:55,325
Suzy, wake up. Please. Wake up.

547
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:58,828
The notes are gone! Someone
stole them from me!

548
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,582
You understand? They disappeared.

549
01:00:02,582 --> 01:00:07,453
Don't fall asleep! Please help me!

550
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,707
-Wake up! Help me!
-I can't.

551
01:00:10,957 --> 01:00:12,458
Can't?

552
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:19,966
This is the only thing I got left,
and that's because I kept it on me. Look.

553
01:00:19,966 --> 01:00:22,468
-Look.
-What is it?

554
01:00:22,468 --> 01:00:26,973
What's the matter with you? Don't
you remember? What's going on?

555
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:31,227
This is the key that'll get us
wherever the teachers go every night.

556
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:35,231
I thought it out yesterday evening
while I was sitting here next to you.

557
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:40,953
Suzy, do you know
anything about witches?

558
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:49,462
Oh, no! Please!

559
01:00:50,963 --> 01:00:54,467
Don't leave me alone!

560
01:01:06,479 --> 01:01:09,482
I must get away!

561
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:09,268
Wait!

562
01:03:29,489 --> 01:03:32,492
Wait!

563
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,410
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

564
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,205
Looking for Sara? She's disappeared.

565
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:06,208
But that's impossible. I just
talked to her last night.

566
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:10,212
She left this morning, as a matter
of fact, without telling anyone.

567
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:13,716
Just packed her bags and left. She
was heard leaving about 6:00.

568
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:17,219
-You heard her leave, didn't you?
-Sara? Oh, yes.

569
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:20,723
I heard the door close and her
footsteps going down the hall.

570
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,727
And then I heard a car driving off down the
street. I guess someone was waiting for her.

571
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:29,732
-But it's impossible.
-If she wasn't happy here, she could've told someone.

572
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:32,735
Why sneak off like a thief?

573
01:09:42,995 --> 01:09:46,999
Hello. May I speak to Frank
Mandel, please? Yes, thank you.

574
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,503
Hello. This is Suzy Bannion.

575
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:54,506
No, we've never met. I'm a
friend of Sara's.

576
01:09:54,506 --> 01:09:59,011
Yes. Hello. Do you happen to
know where Sara is?

577
01:10:00,512 --> 01:10:03,515
Well, she disappeared from
school this morning.

578
01:10:04,016 --> 01:10:07,019
Yes, it seems she left and
took all her luggage.

579
01:10:07,019 --> 01:10:11,523
Yes. Uh, listen, could I see
you sometime today?

580
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:15,527
Well, I'm really worried about her.

581
01:10:15,527 --> 01:10:20,032
Oh, great. Where?

582
01:10:20,032 --> 01:10:23,535
At the convention center.
Okay. I'll see you there.

583
01:10:23,535 --> 01:10:27,039
She didn't inform any of her classmates.
I've already asked all of them.

584
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,542
It's very upsetting. I can't
understand why she did it.

585
01:10:31,043 --> 01:10:33,545
I'm the one who's held responsible
by their families.

586
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:37,166
I'll call her father in Geneva.
Perhaps she might have gone there.

587
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:54,183
I've already phoned Sara's father.
He's the Italian consul in Geneva.

588
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:58,687
But he wasn't there today.
He was away for the weekend.

589
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:02,691
They said he'd be back by monday, and
they don't know anything about her there.

590
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,694
Well, do you understand
Why I'm so worried?

591
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:10,199
Yes, but before we both get upset,
let's wait for the father's return.

592
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:13,702
Maybe they got together this morning
and went off on their own.

593
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:19,708
I know her quite well. She was a
patient of mine three years ago.

594
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:23,712
-Were you aware of that?
-No. I didn't even know you were a psychiatrist.

595
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:28,217
Well, she had a nervous breakdown
after her mother's death,

596
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,719
And she came to me for treatment.

597
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,723
After she got better again,
we remained friends,

598
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:39,728
But lately she was upset about some notions
put into her head by a friend of hers.

599
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:42,731
-Not you, I hope?
-No.

600
01:11:42,982 --> 01:11:45,484
They were kind of wild ideas.

601
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:49,989
She had discovered that the
Tam academy was founded...

602
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:54,626
In 1895 by a certain Helena Markos,
A Greek immigrant,

603
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:58,130
And that the local people
believed her to be a witch.

604
01:11:59,631 --> 01:12:03,635
-I guess you knew that?
-No. But I have a strange feeling...

605
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:09,141
That somebody already told me
about it--Or something similar.

606
01:12:09,141 --> 01:12:11,143
I can't--can't remember.

607
01:12:11,143 --> 01:12:15,147
Well, that really got Sara's imagination
going. Earlier in the 19th century,

608
01:12:15,514 --> 01:12:20,019
The Markos woman had been expelled
from several european countries.

609
01:12:20,019 --> 01:12:25,524
She seemed to have something about her
which urged religious people to persecute her.

610
01:12:26,025 --> 01:12:30,529
She also wrote a number of books, and
I read that among the initiated,

611
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:34,166
She went by the name "The Black Queen."

612
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:38,170
After she settled down here, she became
the subject of a lot of gossip.

613
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:42,174
Nevertheless, she managed to put
her hands on a great deal of money,

614
01:12:42,174 --> 01:12:44,676
And she founded the Tam academy--

615
01:12:44,676 --> 01:12:49,798
At first a sort of school of
dance and occult sciences.

616
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:52,801
But that didn't last long,
because in 1905,

617
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:55,804
After being hounded and
cursed at for ten years,

618
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:59,308
Madame Markos died in a fire.

619
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:02,811
That's all there is, as far
as witchcraft is concerned.

620
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:07,950
The school was taken over by her favorite
pupil. The study of the occult was abandoned.

621
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:12,454
And soon the place became
the famous dance academy.

622
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:17,459
But what does it mean to be a witch?

623
01:13:17,709 --> 01:13:21,080
Well, as a believer in the material
world and a psychiatrist to boot,

624
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:25,584
I'm convinced that the current spread
of belief in magic and the occult...

625
01:13:25,584 --> 01:13:29,088
Is part of mental illness.

626
01:13:29,088 --> 01:13:34,593
Bad luck isn't brought by broken
mirrors, but by broken minds.

627
01:13:36,095 --> 01:13:38,547
Excuse me. Milius?

628
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:41,150
Professor Milius can answer your
question better than I can.

629
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,653
He wrote a book called paranoia
or magic, and believe me,

630
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:46,655
It's the final word on the subject.

631
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:51,160
Excuse me, Milius. If you don't mind,
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

632
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,164
-Fraulein.
-She's interested in your favorite subject:

633
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,666
Witches.

634
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:01,170
Can you tell her something
about the mysterious?

635
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,674
Well, I have to go. I have an
appointment to keep.

636
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,177
Keep me posted, Hmm?

637
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,679
Hello. I'm sorry to bother you.

638
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:15,184
Ah, so, what would you like to know?

639
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,687
-Do you believe in the existence of witches?
-Ah.

640
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:22,691
I have known some women who
are said to be witches.

641
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:26,195
-Really?
-I have studied the phenomenon for a long time.

642
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,697
I am of the opinion that
it is an important appendage...

643
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,201
Of contemporary psychiatry.

644
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,203
You're skeptical, my dear.

645
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:37,706
Well, frankly, it is a little
hard to believe.

646
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:44,830
-What do witches do?
-They are malefic, negative and destructive.

647
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:49,334
Their knowledge of the art of the occult
gives them tremendous powers.

648
01:14:49,835 --> 01:14:54,840
They can change the course of events and
people's lives, but only to do harm.

649
01:14:55,841 --> 01:14:59,344
-You don't believe me?
-No, I--

650
01:14:59,344 --> 01:15:02,848
Their goal is to accumulate
great personal wealth,

651
01:15:02,848 --> 01:15:06,852
But that can only be achieved
by injury to others.

652
01:15:06,852 --> 01:15:10,355
They can cause suffering,
sickness and even the death...

653
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:14,359
Of those who, for whatever
reason, have offended them.

654
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:19,865
Why do you have all this
interest in the occult?

655
01:15:19,865 --> 01:15:22,868
Because some friends spoke
to me about witches.

656
01:15:22,868 --> 01:15:25,871
I read some stuff.

657
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:28,874
Have you ever heard of Helena Markos?

658
01:15:29,374 --> 01:15:32,377
Oh, yes. She was a very
famous black queen.

659
01:15:32,377 --> 01:15:35,380
A powerful witch with a tremendous
talent for doing evil,

660
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:37,382
A real mistress of magic.

661
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:40,769
She lived and died in the city.
Did you know that?

662
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:45,774
Yes. And might there exist
a guild of witches?

663
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:48,777
The correct term would
be a coven of witches.

664
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:51,780
A woman becomes queen of her magic
is a hundred times more powerful...

665
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,783
Than the rest of the coven,
which is like a serpent.

666
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:58,787
Its strength rests with its leader--
That is, with its head.

667
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:02,791
A coven deprived of its leader
is like a headless cobra:

668
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,294
Harmless.

669
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:09,298
Skepticism is the natural
reaction of people nowadays,

670
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:12,301
But magic is ever present.

671
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:16,171
In other words:

672
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,679
Which means that magic is everywhere,

673
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:27,182
And all over the world,
it's a recognized fact.

674
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:30,352
Always.

675
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:47,336
Mark? Mark?

676
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:59,348
Excuse me. Where is everybody?

677
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:03,852
They have all gone to the theater
for the opening of the Bolshoi.

678
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:06,855
-Then why didn't anyone tell me about it?
-I don't know.

679
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,859
Miss Tanner obtained
tickets for everyone.

680
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:19,868
-Frank, this is Suzy. Sara's friend?
-Suzy? Hello?

681
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:22,371
-I can't--
-Talk louder. I can't hear you very well.

682
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:25,874
-Did something happen?
-Well, I haven't heard from Sara,

683
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,877
But a lot of strange
things are happening.

684
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:32,247
I mean, for example,
when I eat at night, I--

685
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:35,484
Hello? Hello, Frank?

686
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,970
Hello? Can you hear me?

687
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:41,873
Frank? Hello?

688
01:17:41,873 --> 01:17:45,227
Hello? Hello?

689
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:47,229
Hello?

690
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:52,234
Hello, Frank, can you hear me?

691
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,827
No!

692
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:32,834
No!

693
01:21:14,352 --> 01:21:17,856
They don't leave the school at all.

694
01:21:17,856 --> 01:21:22,811
The front door is on the left. Their
footsteps are going to the right.

695
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:55,844
Two, three, four, five, six,

696
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:58,813
Seven--

697
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:06,321
I can find out where they're
going by counting their footsteps.

698
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,895
Twenty.

699
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,636
Who's there?

700
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:20,849
Carpet. That's why the
footsteps stop here.

701
01:25:39,284 --> 01:25:42,787
It's impossible. There's gotta
be another way out of here.

702
01:26:51,389 --> 01:26:54,142
The secret--
I saw it behind the door!

703
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:57,528
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

704
01:26:58,897 --> 01:27:01,900
The secret--
I saw it behind the door!

705
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,652
Three Irises!
Turn the blue one!

706
01:29:56,407 --> 01:30:00,411
I told you: we must get rid of that
bitch of an american girl!

707
01:30:00,411 --> 01:30:05,800
Vanish--She must vanish! Make
her disappear, understand?

708
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:12,306
She won't eat or drink
anything this evening.

709
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:22,817
Vanish--She must vanish!

710
01:30:22,934 --> 01:30:25,937
She must die, die, die!

711
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:36,197
Helena, give me power.

712
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:53,214
Sickness! Sickness!

713
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:56,217
Away with her! Away with trouble!

714
01:30:56,217 --> 01:31:01,222
Death, death, death!

715
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:03,177
Who is it? Who's there?

716
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:08,316
I've been expecting you.
The American girl!

717
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:11,819
I knew you'd come.

718
01:33:11,936 --> 01:33:16,824
You wanna kill me? You wanna
kill Helena Markos?

719
01:33:30,921 --> 01:33:34,925
You wanted to kill me.
You wanted to kill me!

720
01:33:34,925 --> 01:33:38,929
What are you going to do now, huh?

721
01:33:42,433 --> 01:33:45,686
Now death is coming for you!

722
01:33:47,805 --> 01:33:52,310
You wanted to kill Helena Markos!

723
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:57,565
Hell is behind that door!

724
01:33:58,032 --> 01:34:01,035
You're going to meet death now!

725
01:34:01,986 --> 01:34:04,488
The living dead!

726
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:30,411
Witch, witch.
