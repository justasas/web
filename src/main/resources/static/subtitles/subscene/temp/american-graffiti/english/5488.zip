1
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:58,669
Hey, Curt, you guys gonna have
a little bash your last night in town?

2
00:01:58,754 --> 00:02:00,153
Moose has been
lookin' for you all day.

3
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:02,987
He got worried. Thought you were
tryin' to avoid him.

4
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:05,713
What do you got?

5
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:10,185
- Oh, great.
- That's $2,000, man. $2,000!

6
00:02:10,274 --> 00:02:13,550
Mr. Jennings gave it to me
to give to you. He's sorry it's late.

7
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,023
It's the first scholarship
the Moose Lodge has given out.

8
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:19,390
He says they're all very proud of you
back at the lodge.

9
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:22,625
- Why don't you hold it for me?
- I don't want it. Take it. It's yours.

10
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:23,942
I'll take it.

11
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:28,953
Listen, your sister calls.
I'll talk to you later.

12
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:31,594
- Wait a second. She can wait.
- Make it short and sweet, huh?

13
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:35,826
Listen, I don't think
I'm gonna be going tomorrow.

14
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,704
Come on.
What are you talking about?

15
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:44,424
I was thinkin' I could wait a year,
go to City for a while.

16
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,391
You chicken fink.

17
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:48,385
After all we went through
to get accepted?

18
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:50,945
We're gettin' out of
this turkey town...

19
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:53,832
and now you wanna crawl
back into your cell?

20
00:02:57,354 --> 00:03:00,266
You wanna end up like John?
You just can't stay 17 forever.

21
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:04,108
- Get that through your head!
- I just need some time.

22
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:07,266
I gotta go talk to Laurie.
Now take it. Take it!

23
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,470
We're leaving in the morning,
all right?

24
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:12,942
We're leaving
in the morning!

25
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:24,109
We gonna rock and roll ourselves
to death, baby!

26
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:26,549
You got the Wolfman Jack Show!

27
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:03,909
Don't with the thing!

28
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,428
Will you stop it
with the Big Bopper stuff?

29
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,584
- Hi, John!
- Not too good, huh?

30
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:12,349
Why is it every girl around here
is ugly or has a boyfriend?

31
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:16,393
Where is the dazzling beauty
I've been searching for all my life?

32
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:20,626
I know what you mean.
The pickings are really gettin' slim.

33
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:22,625
The whole strip is shrinkin'.

34
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:26,869
You know, I remember
about five years ago...

35
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:29,673
it would take a couple of hours
and a tank full of gas...

36
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:31,984
just to make one circuit.

37
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,345
It was really somethin'.

38
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,226
Hey, John.
Someone new in town.

39
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:45,948
Are you gonna go after him?

40
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:48,389
Hey, listen, professor.

41
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:51,705
If he can't find me, then he ain't
even worth racin', right?

42
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:53,944
Big shot.

43
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,070
Well?

44
00:04:58,074 --> 00:04:59,553
Where was I?

45
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,470
How you thought
high school romances were goofy...

46
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:05,307
and we started dating only because
you thought I was cute and funny...

47
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:07,385
but then you suddenly realized...

48
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,271
you were in love with me,
it was serious--

49
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,033
You were leadin' up
to somethin' kinda big.

50
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:18,264
You make it sound like
I'm giving dictation.

51
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:23,389
Well, seriously...

52
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:25,510
what I meant was that...

53
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:28,274
since we do care for each other
so much...

54
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:33,508
and since we should really consider
ourselves as adults now--

55
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,949
Could I have a couple
of those fries?

56
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,185
Where was I?

57
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,105
- Consider ourselves adults.
- Right, right.

58
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:49,187
I thought,
maybe before I leave...

59
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:51,265
we could agree that...

60
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:58,273
seeing other people while I'm away
can't possibly hurt, you know?

61
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:08,623
- You mean dating other people?
- It would strengthen our relationship.

62
00:06:08,714 --> 00:06:11,751
Then we'd know for sure
that we're really in love.

63
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,790
Not that there's any doubt.

64
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,551
I think you're right.

65
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:27,632
I mean, we're not kids anymore...

66
00:06:27,714 --> 00:06:30,182
and it's silly to think
that when we're 3,000 miles apart...

67
00:06:30,274 --> 00:06:32,708
we shouldn't be able
to see other people and go out.

68
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,944
Laurie, listen.
I didn't ask for that back.

69
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:37,946
I know. I just sort of think
it's juvenile now.

70
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,990
I'll keep it at home.
It's less conspicuous there.

71
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,110
- You don't wanna wear it?
- I didn't say that.

72
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,708
I understand,
and I'm not upset.

73
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:49,072
I can't expect you to be a monk
while you're away.

74
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:52,026
I got a really neat
record collection.

75
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:54,674
I even got "Pledging My Love"
by Johnny Ace.

76
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:57,222
How can you love Nelson when
he's going out with Marilyn Gator?

77
00:06:57,314 --> 00:07:00,226
- Since he dumped on you--
- He didn't dump on me, you little dip!

78
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:02,464
Oh, hi, Steve.

79
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:04,553
Hey, sis.

80
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:12,348
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

81
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,425
- What is it?
- Nothing!

82
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:20,352
I've decided to let you take care
of my car while I'm away.

83
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:21,947
At least until Christmas.

84
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,865
I'm comin' back for a couple
of weeks at Christmas.

85
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:28,152
I've got some very simple instructions
for you. Here's the keys.

86
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:31,704
First ofall,
only 30-weight Castrol-R.

87
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:35,104
I've written the tire pressure
and stuff on a pad in the glove--

88
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:37,469
- Are you listening?
- Hey, what's wrong?

89
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:41,903
- Are you crying?
- I can't believe it!

90
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,825
I don't know what to say!

91
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:48,509
I'll love and protect this car
until death do us part.

92
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,630
This is a super fine machine.

93
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:53,592
This might even be better than
Darryl Starbird's superfleck moon--

94
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:57,462
It is! It's better than
Darryl Starbird's superfleck moonbird.

95
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:58,987
Budda?

96
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:03,267
How'd you like to go
to the drive-in movies with me?

97
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:07,029
- You gotta be kidding.
- Would I kid about a thing like that?

98
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:08,945
I have a new car.

99
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,025
Did she do that to you?

100
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:18,912
Curt, you wanna bomb around?
I wanna try out my new wheels.

101
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:20,825
Well, I'd like to, Toad...

102
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,984
but I'm gonna go
with Steve and Laurie to the hop.

103
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:26,908
- Besides, I'd spoil your luck.
- Yeah, right.

104
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:29,030
Tonight, things are gonna be
different.

105
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:32,993
Wait a minute.
You're goin' to the freshman hop?

106
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,269
Come on, man!
That place is for kids.

107
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:38,107
You two just got your ass outta there.
Don't go back there.

108
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:39,673
You ain't got no emotions?

109
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:43,542
We are going to remember
all of the good times.

110
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:46,432
- Yeah, well, go.
- Why don't you come with us?

111
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:49,586
- Bullshit, man!
- Come on. For old times' sake.

112
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:51,983
Listen, you go.
Go ahead, Curtsie baby.

113
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,952
You go on over there and remember
the good times you won't be havin'.

114
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,309
I ain't goin' off to some
goddamn fancy college.

115
00:08:57,394 --> 00:09:00,909
I'm stayin' right here--
havin' fun as usual!

116
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:06,069
Jesus, Milner, you're really
in a great mood tonight!

117
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:08,429
What's the matter, John?

118
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:14,103
Did I do somethin' wrong?
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,264
Man, it's nothin'.

120
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:21,427
- We'll see you later, okay?
- All right.

121
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:24,586
We'll all do somethin' together
before Steve leaves.

122
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:29,230
Wait a minute.
Now you're not goin'?

123
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,111
I don't know.

124
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:16,345
- Hey, Milner!
- What happened to your flathead?

125
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:19,709
- What happened to your flathead?
- Your mother!

126
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:24,671
Your mother!
Hey, we been talkin' 'bout you.

127
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:28,791
There's a very wicked
'55 Chevy lookin' for you.

128
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:32,913
- Yeah, I know.
- Watch out for the cop at Jerry's.

129
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:34,393
Yeah, all right. Thanks.

130
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:52,027
Hey, Toad!

131
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:54,787
Is that you
in that beautiful car?

132
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:57,866
Jeez, what a waste
of machinery!

133
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,626
Hey, kid!

134
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:27,349
Allright, baby,
Here we go with another call,

135
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:32,507
- Answer the phone, dummy,
- Pinkie's Pizza,

136
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,472
You got anymore of those
secret agent spyscoops?

137
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,907
Hit parade
on a stethoscope?

138
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:39,792
No, secret agent spyscope, man,,,

139
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:41,751
that pulls in the moon,
stars, the planets,,,

140
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,792
and the satellites
and little bitty space men,

141
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,705
You have the wrong number,
partner,

142
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:03,025
Wait!
What did you say?

143
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:06,385
Quick. Quick.
Hang a right.

144
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,988
- What? Why?
- Steven, cut over to "G" Street.

145
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:12,305
I just saw a vision.
I saw a goddess.

146
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:13,747
Come on.
You gotta catch up to her.

147
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,711
- I didn't see anything.
- Come on, Curt.

148
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:18,627
We can't be spendin' half the night
chasing girls down for you.

149
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:23,913
Laurie, this was the most perfect,
dazzling creature I've ever seen!

150
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,303
- She's gone. Forget it.
- She spoke to me.

151
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:30,182
She spoke to me through the window!
I think she said, "I love you."

152
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,590
That means nothing
to you people?

153
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:37,189
You have no romance,
no soul?

154
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:41,313
Someone wants me. Someone
roaming the streets wants me.

155
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,305
Will you turn the corner?

156
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:50,585
- Later.
- Alligator.

157
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,666
You're new around here.
Where you from?

158
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:08,144
- Turlock.
- You know a guy named Frank Bartlett?

159
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,384
No. Does he go to Turlock High?

160
00:13:10,474 --> 00:13:12,942
Well, he used to.
He goes to J.C. now.

161
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:16,151
- Do you go toJ.C.?
- Yeah, sure.

162
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:18,668
Wow! Do you know Guy Phillips?

163
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:20,904
Yeah, sure.
I got him in a class.

164
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:22,712
He's so boss!

165
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:25,467
How'd you like to ride around
with me for a while?

166
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,749
I'm sorry. I can't.
I'm going steady.

167
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:33,023
- Come on!
- I just can't.

168
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:34,911
You're just ridin' around
with a bunch of girls.

169
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:37,872
Anybody else in there
wanna go for a ride?

170
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:42,667
You got nothin' to fear.
I'm as harmless as a baby kitten.

171
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:46,872
- I'll go! I'll go!
- Judy's sister'll go with you, okay?

172
00:13:46,954 --> 00:13:50,424
Yeah, sure.
Judy, her sister, her mother.

173
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:52,345
Anybody.
I'll take 'em all.

174
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:54,868
Listen. We'll go up
and stop at that light.

175
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:58,230
It'll turn red by the time we get there.
All right?

176
00:13:58,314 --> 00:14:01,624
If you ever get tired of going steady
with somebody that ain't around...

177
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:03,909
I'm up for grabs.

178
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:28,869
So, you're Judy's little--
Shit! How old are you?

179
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:31,066
I'm old enough.
How old are you?

180
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:33,622
- I'm too old for you.
- You can't be that old.

181
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:36,592
I think you better go back
and sit with your sister.

182
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:40,223
Where are they anyway? Are they
comin' back? This is a joke, right?

183
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,874
This better be a joke,
'cause I'm not drivin' you around!

184
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:46,230
You asked me. What's the matter?
Am I too ugly?

185
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:51,062
Judy doesn't want me with her,
and now you don't want me with you.

186
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:55,033
Nobody wants me.
Even my mother and father hate me.

187
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:57,947
- Everybody hates me.
- They don't hate ya.

188
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:01,629
- You throw me out, I'll scream.
- No, no. Stay cool.

189
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:04,592
Everything's all right.
We'll find your sister.

190
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:08,383
- Can't be too hard to find.
- John, you gonna be there tonight?

191
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,066
Shit! Hey, get down.

192
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:20,308
- Is this called "copping a feel"?
- What? No! Get up. Jesus.

193
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:22,862
- What's your name?
- My name?

194
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:25,104
Mud... if anybody sees you.

195
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:38,503
- What do you got in there, kid?
- More than you can handle.

196
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:07,265
Excuse me.
I think we've had an accident.

197
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:11,029
Damn it, I won't report you this time,
but next time, just watch it!

198
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:35,585
- Good evening. How are ya?
- Yeah, hi.

199
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:39,349
This is really a beautiful car,
you know? Of course you know it.

200
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:41,470
You know what I'd like to give you
for this car?

201
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:43,829
I'd like to give you $1,000!

202
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:46,951
I can't give you that, but I'm not gonna
give you a whole line.

203
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:49,992
I'm gonna tell you
what I can give you. Come over here.

204
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:53,828
How would you like, for $525,
to own this practically new 'Vette?

205
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:55,745
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

206
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:59,304
I'm gonna knock ten percent
right off the top. How about that?

207
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,545
- That's $98 down.
- No, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:05,432
$98 a month.
You ask me how can I do this?

209
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:07,869
I'll tell you
how I can do it.

210
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:10,627
My boss wants to get rid
of the sporty cars.

211
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:13,626
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

212
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:15,227
I don't think it's a good idea.

213
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,623
- I'm busy.
- I want you to listen.

214
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:20,228
I've gotta go!

215
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:22,589
Leave me alone,
for God's sake!

216
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,069
One, two, three, four

217
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:43,072
At the hop

218
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:49,385
You can rock it, you can roll it
Do the stomp, even stroll it at the hop

219
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,710
When the records start spinnin', you
can mix it with the chicken at the hop

220
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,632
Do the dance sensation
that's sweepin'the nation at the hop

221
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:03,144
Let's go to the hop

222
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:15,788
You can swing, you can groove it, you
can really start to move it at the hop

223
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:21,233
Where the jockey is the smoothest
And the music is the coolest at the hop

224
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:24,586
All the guys and chicks
can get their kick sat the hop

225
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:39,670
Let's go!

226
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,709
Why are you so depressed?

227
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:07,989
You'll forget him in a week.

228
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:11,783
After you're elected Senior Queen,
you'll have so many boys after your bod.

229
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:15,913
Peggy, the point is, I do not want
to go out with any other guys.

230
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:20,306
Laurie, I know
it's a drag, but you can't just--

231
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:23,352
Remember what happened
to Evelyn Chelnick?

232
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:26,551
When Mike went into the Marines,
she had a nervous breakdown...

233
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:29,546
and was acting so wacky
she got run over by a bus.

234
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:33,145
I just wish I could
go with him.

235
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,702
Laurie, jeez! Come on.

236
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,465
Hey, zit makeup!
Hey, everybody--

237
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,829
Just cool it, Steve?

238
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,904
Let me see
some of that stuff.

239
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:49,393
You leavin' tomorrow?

240
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:53,625
- You and Laurie engaged yet?
- No, but we got it all worked out.

241
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:56,103
We're still gonna be goin' together,
but we can date other people.

242
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,469
And screw around.
I know.

243
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:00,784
Hey, I hear college girls
really put out.

244
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:10,111
When I saw her
standing there

245
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:13,027
I had to pick her up
I couldn't fail

246
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:18,746
'Cause I knew
I had to make her mine

247
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:21,906
She's so cool
She's so fine

248
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,312
I was tryin' to think
of words to say

249
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,591
So I went up to her
and changed my fate

250
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:38,103
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?

251
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,469
- Let's dance.
- No, thanks.

252
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:47,626
- Laurie, I said I wanna dance.
- Who's stopping you?

253
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:51,866
I thought you might wanna dance with me
our last night together.

254
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:54,468
How sentimental of you.
You'll be back at Christmas.

255
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:57,705
- I want to dance now, not at Christmas.
- Get your cooties off me!

256
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:09,473
- Don't make a scene.
- Go ahead. Slug me. Scar my face!

257
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:12,387
I wouldn't dance with you
if you were the last guy in this gym.

258
00:21:12,474 --> 00:21:15,352
- This is getting good.
- Come on, Eddie, I'll dance with you.

259
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:17,425
You don't mind, do you, Peggy?

260
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,785
Joe College strikes out.

261
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:15,782
Feel so good

262
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,702
Take me by my hand

263
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:35,430
And let's go strollin '

264
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:38,347
In Wonderland

265
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:47,662
Curtis, come here.
Help me, will ya? I'm surrounded.

266
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:50,632
- Come here.
- You won't dance? Come on.

267
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:52,545
No, really, I'd like to,
but I can't.

268
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:55,671
I fold Mr. Simpson saw me dancing
with one of you sexy little--

269
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:59,190
excuse me --one of you young ladies,
he'd have my rear end.

270
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,392
Come on, gentlemen, back inside.
Put it out. Let's go.

271
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:09,625
Kids! Want a cigarette?

272
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:12,591
All right.

273
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:16,826
- I thought you'd left.
- No, not yet. I have no matches.

274
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:19,508
That's all right.

275
00:23:20,794 --> 00:23:25,549
Brother! How do I get stuck
with dance supervision?

276
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:27,750
You goin' back east?

277
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:32,305
I remember the day I went off.
Got drunk as hell the night before.

278
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:35,067
- Blotto.
- Blotto. Exactly.

279
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:39,193
- Barfed on the train all the next day.
- Cute. Very cute.

280
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:41,223
Where'd you go again?

281
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,265
Middlebury. Vermont.

282
00:23:43,354 --> 00:23:45,993
- Got a scholarship.
- Only stayed a semester.

283
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,463
One semester, after all that.
Came back here.

284
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:50,431
Why'd you come back?

285
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:53,631
Decided I wasn't
the competitive type.

286
00:23:53,714 --> 00:23:55,545
I don't know.
Maybe I was scared.

287
00:23:57,754 --> 00:24:00,871
Well, I think I may find
that I'm not...

288
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:03,149
the competitive type myself.

289
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:08,433
- What do you mean?
- I'm not really sure that I'm going.

290
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,586
Now, don't be stupid. Experience life.
Have some fun, Curtis--

291
00:24:11,674 --> 00:24:13,471
Bill?

292
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:18,264
Mr. Wolfe?
Can I speak with you a minute?

293
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:22,308
- Hi, Curt.
- Jane.

294
00:24:24,194 --> 00:24:25,946
Good luck, Curtis.

295
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:29,345
Yeah. I'll see ya.

296
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,072
Thanks a lot.

297
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:59,343
A Wolfman Jack exclusive!

298
00:24:59,434 --> 00:25:01,868
The Beach Boys, baby,
A brand-newgroup,

299
00:25:01,954 --> 00:25:04,229
I predict they gonna go
a long way,

300
00:25:04,314 --> 00:25:06,430
This is called
"Surfin' Safari,"

301
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:09,547
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learnin' how

302
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,546
Come on and safari with me

303
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,628
Early in the mornin '
we'll be startin'out

304
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:19,592
Some honeys
will be comin' along

305
00:25:19,674 --> 00:25:23,189
The next night
we went out with ammunition--

306
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:25,629
Don't you have some homework
or somethin' to do?

307
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:27,625
No sweat.
My mother does it.

308
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:30,228
Anyway,
he thought he was had.

309
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:32,350
He started the car and couldn't see
through the windshield...

310
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:34,709
and zoomed straight
into the canal.

311
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:37,866
- I still got some-- don't try anything.
- Watch it, will ya?

312
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:40,946
Jesus Christ!
Thanks a lot.

313
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:46,630
Hey, drivin' is
a serious business.

314
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:49,945
I ain't havin' no accidents
just because of you.

315
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,752
Come on. Don't give me any grief.
I'm warning ya.

316
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,745
Spare me, killer.

317
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:05,353
Oh, shit!

318
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:10,583
- Why did you do that?
- I don't like that surfin' shit.

319
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:15,346
Rock and roll's been goin' downhill
ever since Buddy Holly died.

320
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:17,629
Don't you think
the Beach Boys are boss?

321
00:26:17,714 --> 00:26:20,274
- You would, you grungy little twerp.
- Grungy!

322
00:26:20,354 --> 00:26:24,029
You big weenie.
If I had a boyfriend, he'd pound you.

323
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:26,947
Yeah, sure. Shit!

324
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:30,629
- Holstein!
- Good. A cop.

325
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,148
I'm gonna tell him
you tried to rape me.

326
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,907
I'm gonna tell him how old I am,
my parents don't know I'm out...

327
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,791
and you tried to rape me.

328
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:40,388
- Yeah, with shaving cream.
- Boy, are you up a creek.

329
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,227
Come on. Really, Carol,
don't say anything.

330
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:45,909
If you say:
"I was a dirty bird.

331
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:48,030
Carol's not grungy.
She's bitchin'."

332
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,066
Say it. I'll tell him.

333
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:59,550
I was a dirty bird.
Carol's not grungy. She's bitchin'.

334
00:26:59,634 --> 00:27:01,272
I'll think about it.

335
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:12,751
- Where you goin', Milner?
- I'm goin' home, sir.

336
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:17,350
- Where 've you been?
- We were-- At the movies, sir.

337
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:20,983
You didn't happen to be around 12th
and "G" about 8:30 tonight, did you?

338
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:25,306
No. No, sir.
We were at the movies, like I said.

339
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:31,230
I stopped you because the light
on your license plate's out.

340
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:33,703
I'm gonna have
to cite you for that.

341
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:37,070
And the front end
of this thing you're drivin'...

342
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,985
looks a little low.

343
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,032
No, sir.
It's 12 1/2 inches, regulation size.

344
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:45,186
It's been checked several times.
You can check it if you like, sir.

345
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:52,590
Look, Milner. Listen.
You can't fool with the law.

346
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:54,665
We know that was you tonight.

347
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:56,551
We have an excellent
description of this car.

348
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:59,910
I could run you in right now,
and I could make it stick.

349
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:01,746
But I'm not gonna do that.
You know why?

350
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:04,751
I want to catch you in the act,...

351
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,950
and when I do,
I'm gonna nail you but good.

352
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:13,350
Happy birthday, Milner.

353
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:17,072
Thank you... asshole.

354
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,031
You're a regular J.D.

355
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,629
File that under C.S.
over there.

356
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:24,784
C.S.?
What's that stand for?

357
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:27,832
Chicken shit.
That's what it is.

358
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:03,632
Ain't he neat?

359
00:29:03,714 --> 00:29:07,912
You know a guy around here
with a piss-yellow deuce coupe?

360
00:29:07,994 --> 00:29:11,111
- Supposed to be hot stuff?
- You mean John Milner?

361
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:13,833
Ain't nobody can beat him, man.
He's got the fastest--

362
00:29:13,914 --> 00:29:17,509
- I ain't nobody, dork. Right?
- Right.

363
00:29:17,594 --> 00:29:21,064
You see this Milner,
you tell him I'm lookin' for him, huh?

364
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:24,464
Tell him I aim to blow his ass
right off the road.

365
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,385
Ain't he neat?

366
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:45,344
What a babe!
What a bitchin' babe!

367
00:30:01,954 --> 00:30:03,626
Hello.

368
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,346
You sure you don't
need a lift somewhere?

369
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:12,393
You know John Milner?
John Milner's a good friend of mine.

370
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:17,146
Did anybody ever tell you that you look
just like Connie Stevens?

371
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:20,146
- You do. I really mean it.
- For real?

372
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:22,589
Yeah. I met her once
at a Dick Clark road show.

373
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:26,144
-Yeah? You really think I look like her?
-Yeah, no shit.

374
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:29,863
I'm sorry. I mean-- I mean that
I'm not just feeding you a line.

375
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:33,230
I really think you do.
You look like Connie Stevens.

376
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:35,828
- What's your name?
- Debbie.

377
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:38,109
I always thought
I look like Sandra Dee.

378
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:43,389
- Well, you look a lot like her too.
- Is this your car?

379
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,271
Yeah. I'm Terry, the--

380
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:51,306
- They usually call me Terry the Tiger.
- It's really tough-lookin'.

381
00:30:51,394 --> 00:30:55,307
- What school you go to?
- Dewey. Can it lay rubber?

382
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,943
Yeah, I got a 327 Chevy in it.
It's got six Strombergs.

383
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:03,232
That's bitchin' tuck-and-roll.
I really love the feel of tuck-and-roll.

384
00:31:03,314 --> 00:31:05,225
You do?

385
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:09,990
Well, come in. I'll let you feel it.
I mean you can touch it if you want.

386
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:11,985
I'll let you feel the upholstery.

387
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,746
Okay.

388
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,829
- Peel out.
- What?

389
00:31:29,914 --> 00:31:32,474
Peel out.
I just love it when guys peel out.

390
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:44,032
And they came all the way
from Stockton. Let's hear it.

391
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:47,586
I don't care
if you leave this second.

392
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:52,384
And we wanna thank Darby Langdon,
who did all these neat decorations.

393
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:57,274
Now the next dance
is gonna be a snowball...

394
00:31:57,354 --> 00:32:01,063
and leading it off is last year's
class president, Steve Bolander...

395
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:04,430
and this year's head cheerleader,
Laurie Henderson.

396
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:19,551
- Come on.
- "Come on" what?

397
00:32:19,634 --> 00:32:22,068
Steven, please.
Smile or something.

398
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,831
Quit pinching!

399
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,111
You think I care if you go off?
You think I'm gonna crack up?

400
00:32:41,194 --> 00:32:44,584
- Boy, are you conceited!
- I don't know why I ever asked you out.

401
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:48,303
- You didn't. I asked you out.
- What do you mean, you asked me out?

402
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:50,225
Backwards Day.
Remember?

403
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:53,465
If I had waited for you to ask me--
Oh, brother!

404
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,148
Even after that, you didn't call me
for two weeks.

405
00:32:56,234 --> 00:33:00,466
- I was busy.
- You were scared. Dave Ogler told me.

406
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:03,751
When you did ask me out,
you didn't kiss me for three dates.

407
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:07,224
- Well, I was--
- Scared. Jim Kiler told me.

408
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:10,390
I even asked my father
why you hadn't kissed me.

409
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:13,432
- Your father. Great.
- You know what he said?

410
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:15,505
He said he thought
you were bright enough...

411
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:18,904
and that you'd probably
get around to it after a while.

412
00:33:18,994 --> 00:33:21,349
You didn't, of course.
I had to.

413
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:25,427
Remember the picnic?

414
00:33:25,514 --> 00:33:27,266
Out at the canyon?

415
00:33:27,354 --> 00:33:30,312
Boy! You don't remember
anything, do you?

416
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:33,113
The first one,
up at the lake.

417
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:35,310
That was the first time
you kissed me.

418
00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:40,829
I had to practically
throw myself at you.

419
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:42,063
I remember.

420
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,713
What's wrong?

421
00:34:10,794 --> 00:34:12,386
Go to hell.

422
00:34:18,794 --> 00:34:21,433
What are you doin',
stealin' hubcaps?

423
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:24,984
- Well, hey, Wendy.
- How've you been?

424
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:27,030
Fine.

425
00:34:27,114 --> 00:34:31,153
- Great. How you been?
- Wait a sec.

426
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:33,111
Wait a minute!

427
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,790
Bobbie Tucker.
She's got her car.

428
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:40,745
- Heard you're going away to school.
- Maybe, maybe.

429
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:44,386
- What?
- Same old Curt.

430
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:48,433
All the time we were going together,
you never knew what you were doing.

431
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:55,313
- I gotta go.
- Where ya goin'?

432
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:58,192
- Nowhere.
- You mind if I come along?

433
00:34:58,274 --> 00:35:00,913
- Okay.
- Okay.

434
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,904
Louie, Louie

435
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:08,225
Me gotta go

436
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:13,503
A fine little girl
She's waitin' for me

437
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:17,269
Catch a ship
across the sea

438
00:35:17,354 --> 00:35:21,188
Sail the ship all alone

439
00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:24,664
Never think
l'll make it home

440
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:44,944
All right, Bolander, break that up.
You know the rules.

441
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:48,310
You and your girlfriend wanna do that,
go some place else, huh?

442
00:35:48,394 --> 00:35:51,386
Hey, Kroot.
Why don't you go kiss a duck?

443
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:54,864
- What did you say?
- I said go kiss a duck, marble-head.

444
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:58,185
All right, Bolander,
you are suspended.

445
00:35:58,274 --> 00:36:01,346
Don't you even come in Monday.
You're out!

446
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:05,504
I graduated last semester.
Remember?

447
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:26,393
Why don't we go out
to the canal?

448
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:28,749
What for?

449
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:31,109
Listen, I can get tough
with you too, you know.

450
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:33,310
Hard guy.

451
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:54,387
A double Chubby Chuck, a chili-barb,
two orders of French fries and--

452
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:57,034
- Cherry Coke.
- And two Cherry Cokes.

453
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:00,351
What?

454
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:02,708
Right. Cool.

455
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:06,828
Hey, Deb.
How's my soft baby?

456
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:08,745
Come on. Beat it, Vic.
I'm not your baby.

457
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:13,104
Come on, honey.
So I never called you back.

458
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:15,071
I been, you know, busy.

459
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:16,951
Yeah, three weeks?

460
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,025
Besides, it only took me one night
to realize...

461
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,503
if brains were dynamite,
you couldn't blow your nose.

462
00:37:21,594 --> 00:37:25,587
Look who's talking. Who's the wimp
you're hangin' out with now? Einstein?

463
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:28,666
Tiger happens to be
very intelligent, unlike you.

464
00:37:28,754 --> 00:37:33,191
I know everything your dirty little mind
is thinking. It shows.

465
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:36,072
Hey, now, buddy, look.
The lady obviously doesn't want--

466
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,270
Look, creep. You want
a knuckle sandwich?

467
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:41,152
No, thanks. I'm waitin'
for a double Chubby Chuck.

468
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:42,792
Then keep your smart-ass
mouth shut.

469
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:44,671
I'll call you sometime, Deb.

470
00:37:44,754 --> 00:37:48,269
- Some night when I'm hard up.
- I won't be home.

471
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:52,424
Get out of here.

472
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:55,785
You seem to know
a lot of weird guys.

473
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:59,423
That creep's not a friend of mine.
He's just... horny.

474
00:37:59,514 --> 00:38:02,347
That's why I like you.
You're different.

475
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:05,585
I-- I am? I mean,
you really think I'm intelligent?

476
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:09,223
Yeah. And I bet you're smart enough
to get us some brew.

477
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:15,431
Brew? Oh, liquor.

478
00:38:19,394 --> 00:38:21,544
Yeah, this place is
too crowded anyway.

479
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:36,744
What about your hamburgers
and Cokes, sir?

480
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:42,591
Will you speed up?
You're gonna lose her.

481
00:38:42,674 --> 00:38:46,349
Cut around him.
Just hang a right at the corner.

482
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:48,868
Lost her again.

483
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,673
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

484
00:38:51,754 --> 00:38:53,551
But I'm gonna find out.

485
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:56,551
I know who she is.

486
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:02,391
Well, come on, Bob.

487
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:05,625
Come on! Who is she?

488
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,665
Come on!

489
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:12,429
You know Mr. Beeman?
He owns Hepcat Jewelers?

490
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,185
That's his wife.

491
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:18,265
Get outta here.

492
00:39:18,354 --> 00:39:21,027
That's ridiculous.
That girl is young and beautiful.

493
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:24,026
- And married.
- And she was cruising Tenth Street.

494
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,582
You gotta be thinkin'
of someone else.

495
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:30,872
Did you know that my ex is going
to become a presidential aide?

496
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:37,550
It's a secret, so don't tell anybody,
but his greatest ambition...

497
00:39:37,634 --> 00:39:39,989
is to shake hands
with President Kennedy.

498
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:45,263
How do you suppose you're gonna
do that, wishy-washy, at J.C.?

499
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:47,993
Maybe I've grown up.
Maybe I changed my mind.

500
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:50,907
- Doubt it.
- Maybe you don't think you can do it.

501
00:39:50,994 --> 00:39:53,588
- Maybe you oughta shut up.
- Maybe I ought to, but I won't.

502
00:39:53,674 --> 00:39:56,552
Maybe you oughta
come into the aft chamber...

503
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:58,989
where we can
discuss this in private.

504
00:40:03,554 --> 00:40:05,590
Thanks a lot.

505
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:07,712
Come on, Wendy.

506
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:16,626
Move over.
I'm not sitting on your lap.

507
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,752
- To the opera, James.
- Drop dead.

508
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:24,984
Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam
and have a little orgy.

509
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:26,143
You wish!

510
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:29,863
I could pick up some margarine.
We could roll around in it for a while.

511
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:58,308
- I've been silly.
- Yeah?

512
00:40:58,394 --> 00:41:00,305
I'm really glad
you're gonna stay.

513
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,904
We might even have
a class together.

514
00:41:09,314 --> 00:41:10,463
- Maybe.
- Look.

515
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:13,307
There's Kip Pullman.
He's so neat.

516
00:41:13,394 --> 00:41:16,147
Say somethin' to him
when we go by.

517
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:19,306
- What do you want me to say?
- Anything. I just wanna meet him.

518
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,225
Hey, Kip, buddy.
What's up?

519
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:25,192
Hey, Henderson, long time no see.
What you been doin'?

520
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,583
Nothin'.

521
00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:31,633
I just wanted to tell you
Bobbie here is madly in love with you...

522
00:41:31,714 --> 00:41:34,547
and trembles at the sight
of your rippling biceps.

523
00:41:39,194 --> 00:41:43,187
- Out of my car, you--
- Wait a second!

524
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:47,506
I hate you!
Get out of my car!

525
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:50,191
Temper, temper!

526
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:43,511
Here it is:
one ten-cent Coke with ice.

527
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,906
And don't take all day
drinkin' it. Please.

528
00:42:47,994 --> 00:42:50,792
Rats! I thought
some of my friends might be here.

529
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:53,786
Probably a couple of weeks
past their bedtime.

530
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:55,910
There's Dee Dee.
I hope she sees me.

531
00:42:55,994 --> 00:42:57,632
Oh, shit. Dee Dee.

532
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:01,751
Hiya, John.

533
00:43:01,834 --> 00:43:03,870
- What do you say, Al?
- Not much.

534
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:06,832
You think if I brought my Mopar
by the shop on Monday...

535
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:08,188
you could spot-weld
the bumper bracket?

536
00:43:08,274 --> 00:43:11,630
Sure, anything.Just come by
before noon, all right?

537
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:15,150
- You met Linda?
- No, no. Hi, Linda.

538
00:43:15,234 --> 00:43:18,032
This is my cousin, Carol.

539
00:43:20,874 --> 00:43:22,990
I'm baby-sittin'.

540
00:43:23,074 --> 00:43:25,508
- Baby-sitting!
- Jesus! Watch it, will ya?

541
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:30,030
Been hittin' me all night.
Kids will be kids, you know.

542
00:43:30,114 --> 00:43:33,629
Goddamn it! Why don't you
grow up, for Christ's sake?

543
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:35,784
We don't get along too well,
you know?

544
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:39,309
- Been like this all--
- You spastic creep.

545
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:33,506
Hi, cousin.
How's your bod?

546
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:41,786
Wolfman Top 40 is
Box 1300, Chula Vista,

547
00:44:41,874 --> 00:44:45,833
Wolfman sweatshirts
is Wolf Enterprises, Bakersfield,

548
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:01,623
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, son?

549
00:45:02,114 --> 00:45:04,025
I was wondering--

550
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:07,230
- Could you give me the time?
- Sure.

551
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:09,430
It's quarter to 12:00.

552
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:11,948
Quarter to 12:00.
Good. Thanks a lot.

553
00:45:17,154 --> 00:45:20,112
Excuse me, sir.
I got a problem.

554
00:45:20,194 --> 00:45:22,947
See, I lost my I.D. in a flood...

555
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:25,832
and I was wondering,
since you're going in there anyway...

556
00:45:25,914 --> 00:45:28,428
could you pick me up
some Old Harper's-- hard stuff?

557
00:45:28,514 --> 00:45:31,233
- Would you buy me a bottle?
- Why, certainly.

558
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,152
I lost my wife too.

559
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:36,031
Her name wasn't Idy though...

560
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:38,548
and it wasn't in a flood,
but I know what you--

561
00:45:38,634 --> 00:45:42,513
Yeah, good. Here's some money.
Old Harper.

562
00:45:52,074 --> 00:45:54,349
- Quarter to 12:00.
- Right-o.

563
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:56,390
- Night.
- Night.

564
00:46:04,314 --> 00:46:06,748
No, not wine!

565
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:34,747
- Was there an old man in here just now?
- Yeah. Just went out the back.

566
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,631
Want something?

567
00:46:39,314 --> 00:46:40,827
Yeah.

568
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:43,553
Let me have
a Three Musketeers...

569
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,229
and a ballpoint pen,
one of those combs there...

570
00:46:47,314 --> 00:46:49,066
a pint of Old Harper...

571
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:52,191
a couple off lash light batteries
and some beef jerky.

572
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,950
You got an ID for the liquor?

573
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,666
Yeah.

574
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:15,029
Oh, nuts.
I left it in the car.

575
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:18,231
Sorry. You'll have to get it before.

576
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:21,226
I also--
I forgot the car.

577
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:32,506
Did you get it?

578
00:47:32,594 --> 00:47:33,788
You got it!

579
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,909
You didn't get it.
Why didn't you get it?

580
00:47:38,994 --> 00:47:42,270
I needed some things and
I thought as long as I was in there--

581
00:47:42,354 --> 00:47:46,029
Look, Debbie,
can you loan me a dollar?

582
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,025
Are you for real? Come on.

583
00:47:48,114 --> 00:47:49,945
Girls don't pay. Guys pay.

584
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:53,868
See, I've only got a 50,
and he doesn't have change.

585
00:47:57,114 --> 00:48:00,663
I can't believe this.
I really cannot believe this.

586
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:03,186
Here.

587
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:12,070
- Excuse me. Could you--
- Buy you a bottle of booze?

588
00:48:12,154 --> 00:48:15,146
Yeah, I know. You lost your I.D.
What kind do you want?

589
00:48:15,234 --> 00:48:18,624
Gee, that's terrific.
Just some Old Harper?

590
00:49:00,594 --> 00:49:02,585
That one over there--
that's Freddy Benson's 'Vette.

591
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:06,508
He had a head-on collision
with a drunk. Boom!

592
00:49:06,594 --> 00:49:08,585
Didn't have a chance.

593
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:11,268
He was a good driver too.

594
00:49:11,354 --> 00:49:15,063
It's pretty grim when a guy gets it
and it's not even his own fault.

595
00:49:15,154 --> 00:49:16,985
Needs a paint job,
that's for sure.

596
00:49:17,074 --> 00:49:18,905
See that over there? That '41?

597
00:49:18,994 --> 00:49:22,145
That used to be-- believe it or not--
the fastest car in the valley.

598
00:49:22,234 --> 00:49:24,589
I never got a chance
to race Earl, though.

599
00:49:24,674 --> 00:49:29,350
He got his 1955 in about
the hairiest crash we ever had here.

600
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:31,265
Jesus, you should 've seen it.

601
00:49:31,354 --> 00:49:34,073
Eight kids killed
and both drivers.

602
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:37,624
Board of Education was real impressed,
so they filmed the whole thing.

603
00:49:37,714 --> 00:49:40,387
Now they show it
in driver's education classes.

604
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:43,113
Probably see it
if you get lucky.

605
00:49:43,194 --> 00:49:47,745
Course, pretty tough
when they take somebody with them.

606
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:53,592
You've never had an accident though.
You told me.

607
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:55,949
Well, I come mighty close.

608
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,502
Almost rolled it
a couple of times.

609
00:49:58,834 --> 00:50:02,429
But I've been just quick enough
to stay out of this graveyard.

610
00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:06,866
Bet you're the fastest.

611
00:50:08,354 --> 00:50:11,152
I've never been beat.
A lot of guys tried.

612
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,671
Seems to me there's more guys lately
than there's ever been.

613
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:23,671
Sneakin' around
with the Wolfman, baby,

614
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:30,547
This is gonna strike a raw nerve, Mama,
Here's The Platters,

615
00:50:31,434 --> 00:50:33,345
Oh, yes

616
00:50:33,434 --> 00:50:36,585
I'm the great pretender

617
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:42,912
Pretending
that I'm doing well

618
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:46,832
My need is such

619
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:50,065
I pretend too much

620
00:50:50,154 --> 00:50:54,227
l'm lonely
but no one can tell

621
00:50:57,594 --> 00:50:59,346
What are you doin', creep?

622
00:51:01,354 --> 00:51:02,753
Who, me?

623
00:51:05,234 --> 00:51:07,702
No, I'm talkin'
to the other 50 creeps here.

624
00:51:11,714 --> 00:51:13,545
You know Gil Gonzales?

625
00:51:16,514 --> 00:51:18,345
No, I don't.

626
00:51:18,434 --> 00:51:20,994
Don't know Gil.
Well, you oughta.

627
00:51:21,074 --> 00:51:24,589
He's a friend of ours. That's his car
you got your butt parked on.

628
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:34,110
- Where you goin'?
- Nowhere.

629
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:36,947
You must be goin' someplace.
You left here, didn't ya?

630
00:51:37,954 --> 00:51:40,104
Bring him over here.
I want to show him somethin'.

631
00:51:44,754 --> 00:51:46,267
Bend down here.
Look across here. See?

632
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:50,025
Right across there.
You see?

633
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,950
- I guess so.
- You scratched it, man.

634
00:51:54,034 --> 00:51:56,423
Where do you get off
sittin' on Gil's car, man?

635
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:58,425
Sorry.

636
00:51:58,514 --> 00:52:00,584
It's really not much of a scratch.
I don't think you'd see it.

637
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:05,543
It ain't the size that's in question
here. It's the principle!

638
00:52:05,634 --> 00:52:08,432
Jeez, this is gonna be tough.

639
00:52:12,274 --> 00:52:14,265
What should we do with you?

640
00:52:14,354 --> 00:52:16,822
Tie him to the car
and drag him.

641
00:52:24,314 --> 00:52:26,111
You know Toby Juarez?

642
00:52:27,634 --> 00:52:29,864
He's a Pharaoh, isn't he?

643
00:52:32,874 --> 00:52:34,466
Sure, we know Toby.

644
00:52:35,594 --> 00:52:37,903
We killed him last night.

645
00:52:37,994 --> 00:52:40,827
Tied him to the car
and dragged him.

646
00:52:46,714 --> 00:52:48,750
This is gonna take
some thinkin'.

647
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,706
You better come with us and maybe
take a ride with the Pharaohs, huh?

648
00:52:58,794 --> 00:53:01,592
No, listen, I'd really like to,
but I've gotta--

649
00:53:03,554 --> 00:53:05,385
I'd rather--

650
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,704
I know just how you feel.

651
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:10,228
- Shotgun.
- No, I called it.

652
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:12,748
- When?
- Before we picked you up.

653
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:14,984
You can't call it for the whole night.
I got it now.

654
00:53:15,074 --> 00:53:17,269
Get in the back, punk.

655
00:53:17,354 --> 00:53:20,903
Will you get in there?
Jesus!

656
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,347
Rock 'n' roll will stand, man!

657
00:54:07,434 --> 00:54:09,823
Who is this
on the Wolfman telephone?

658
00:54:09,954 --> 00:54:12,263
- Hello, it's collect,
- Your name is Collette?

659
00:54:12,354 --> 00:54:15,426
- Yeah, collect call for Wolfman--
- Your name is Collette Call?

660
00:54:15,514 --> 00:54:17,869
- Sir, this is the operator,
- Are you French, operator?

661
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:21,105
This is a collect call
for Wolfman Jack,

662
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:24,152
- I love you, operator,
- Is this Wolfman Jack?

663
00:54:24,234 --> 00:54:27,624
- Is Floyd there?
- It's for Wolfman Jack,

664
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:31,753
I just love listenin' to Wolfman.
My mom won't let me at home.

665
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:34,712
Because he's a Negro.
I think he's terrific.

666
00:54:34,794 --> 00:54:36,671
Do you know that he broadcasts
from a plane...

667
00:54:36,754 --> 00:54:39,063
that flies around in circles
all the time?

668
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:40,553
Do you believe that?

669
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:43,194
Floyd, I love you, Floyd,

670
00:54:43,274 --> 00:54:45,583
Floyd, is this you, Floyd?

671
00:54:45,674 --> 00:54:47,790
Floyd, I cannot look on thee,

672
00:54:47,874 --> 00:54:50,513
Love took my hand
and smiling did reply,,,

673
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:52,710
"Who made the eyes but I?"

674
00:54:52,794 --> 00:54:55,991
Floyd, reach out,
Touch my soul, Floyd!

675
00:54:56,074 --> 00:54:58,144
- Your party's ready, sir,
- Hello, Floyd!

676
00:55:00,074 --> 00:55:02,304
You tell her, Wolfman!
He's my man.

677
00:55:02,394 --> 00:55:04,464
When I graduate,
I'm gonna be a Wolfman.

678
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:07,705
- He broadcasts out of Mexico someplace.
- No, he don't.

679
00:55:07,794 --> 00:55:09,785
I've seen the station
outside of town.

680
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:14,463
That's just a clearing station.
So he can fool the cops.

681
00:55:14,554 --> 00:55:18,706
He blasts that thing around the world.
It's against the law, man.

682
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:21,228
- They'll never catch the Wolfman.
- No way.

683
00:55:24,714 --> 00:55:26,625
Man, who cut the cheese?

684
00:55:28,314 --> 00:55:30,225
"He who smelt it, dealt it."

685
00:55:31,554 --> 00:55:34,591
There's that bad-ass Chevy again.

686
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:36,904
Look at that snatch
he's got with him.

687
00:55:36,994 --> 00:55:40,066
- He looks like a wimp.
- Probably is.

688
00:55:40,154 --> 00:55:42,622
Wimps get all the snatch.

689
00:55:46,154 --> 00:55:50,033
Milner ain't gonna beat that.
His time has come.

690
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:53,629
He's gettin' old.
He ain't as fast as he used to be.

691
00:55:55,674 --> 00:55:58,427
You got two seconds
to get your ass over in your corner.

692
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:01,710
Don't worry,
I won't rape you.

693
00:56:03,074 --> 00:56:06,953
- You got a bitchin' car.
- Yeah, I know.

694
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:11,949
In fact, your car's so neat,
we're gonna give you our special prize.

695
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:13,865
You want me to give it to ya?

696
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,787
Sweet heart, if the prize is you,
I'm a ready Teddy.

697
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,024
Well, get bent, turkey!

698
00:56:22,794 --> 00:56:25,183
Very funny!

699
00:56:25,274 --> 00:56:28,903
What a chop! Ha-ha!
Quit laughing!

700
00:56:28,994 --> 00:56:31,588
- Jump out and flatten their tires.
- Wait a minute.

701
00:56:31,674 --> 00:56:35,349
- Just do what I say!
- All right, boss.

702
00:58:13,434 --> 00:58:15,504
It's a really beautiful
night tonight.

703
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:20,072
It's a perfect night
for horseback riding.

704
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:22,270
I was going with a guy
who had horses once.

705
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:27,104
- Yeah? I had a couple of horses myself.
- Really?

706
00:58:27,194 --> 00:58:30,027
I used them for hunting.
I do a lot of hunting.

707
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:34,509
Deer mostly.
Got a couple of bear last year.

708
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:38,064
Those were good ponies. Had to
train 'em myself. Took a lot of time.

709
00:58:38,154 --> 00:58:41,066
Do you still have 'em?
We can go for a ride.

710
00:58:41,154 --> 00:58:45,193
No, no. I had to sell 'em
to get these wheels. And a Jeep.

711
00:58:46,434 --> 00:58:48,106
I got a Jeep pickup
with four-wheel drive.

712
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:50,344
It's got a gun rack.
I use that for hunting mostly.

713
00:58:50,434 --> 00:58:53,551
Why do you kill little animals?
I think that's terrible.

714
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:55,465
Well, yeah.

715
00:58:55,554 --> 00:58:59,342
I figure with bears, though,
it's me or them.

716
00:59:01,474 --> 00:59:04,272
- I think you're really neat.
- Wait a second.

717
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:07,391
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

718
00:59:07,474 --> 00:59:11,149
I guess maybe it's the booze
or somethin'.

719
00:59:23,874 --> 00:59:25,944
- Oh! You pinched me.
- I'm sorry.

720
00:59:26,034 --> 00:59:28,264
Let me get my head
over here.

721
00:59:28,354 --> 00:59:30,470
You get up. Okay.

722
00:59:30,554 --> 00:59:33,466
My leg, my leg! Watch it.

723
00:59:39,314 --> 00:59:41,544
I just love
tuck-and-roll upholstery.

724
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:47,226
Jesus, it's like
Grand Central Station around here.

725
00:59:47,314 --> 00:59:50,192
- Why don't we go someplace else?
- Come on. They won't come back.

726
00:59:50,274 --> 00:59:52,469
Wait a minute.

727
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:55,466
I got a blanket in the back.
Why don't we go over into the field?

728
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:57,465
All right. Okay.

729
00:59:59,674 --> 01:00:04,794
- How old are you?
- I'm 13, How old are you?

730
01:00:04,874 --> 01:00:08,469
- I'm only 14,
- I love you, Wolfman,

731
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:14,988
We're gonna do the weather
for the valleys and mountain tops,

732
01:00:15,074 --> 01:00:18,430
It's gonna be hot,
About 200 degrees in Merced,

733
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,470
Four hundred degrees
out in Fresno,

734
01:00:20,554 --> 01:00:23,910
And about 500 degrees
up around the valley somewhere,

735
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:26,872
You got
the Wolfman Jack Show!

736
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:44,586
This is terrific.
I love miniature golf.

737
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,665
Is that right?

738
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:48,551
I hate it.

739
01:00:48,674 --> 01:00:51,711
I don't play it too often.
What are we doing here?

740
01:00:51,794 --> 01:00:53,671
We're outta gas, man.

741
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:57,064
They don't sell gas here.

742
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,987
I know.
But we're outta money too.

743
01:01:20,194 --> 01:01:22,662
What are you punks doin'?

744
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:23,709
What's goin' on here?

745
01:01:26,074 --> 01:01:29,783
Hi, Mr. Gordon.
What's up?

746
01:01:31,314 --> 01:01:33,703
Henderson?
Curt Henderson?

747
01:01:33,794 --> 01:01:35,671
Are you with these punks?

748
01:01:35,754 --> 01:01:38,473
These are just
some friends of mine.

749
01:01:38,554 --> 01:01:42,024
We're just-- You know.

750
01:01:42,114 --> 01:01:45,265
You had me nervous there
for a second, huh?

751
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:50,343
You didn't leave yet, huh?

752
01:01:52,474 --> 01:01:55,034
No, I'm not--

753
01:01:55,194 --> 01:01:58,152
I'm not scheduled to leave
until tomorrow morning.

754
01:01:58,234 --> 01:01:59,713
Tomorrow?

755
01:01:59,794 --> 01:02:02,262
Hank Anderson's inside.
Come in and say good-bye.

756
01:02:02,354 --> 01:02:06,552
He brought your name up
at the Moose Hall. You got the check?

757
01:02:13,594 --> 01:02:15,824
Hank, look who's here.

758
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:22,148
How are you, Curt?
What a pleasant surprise.

759
01:02:22,234 --> 01:02:26,386
Congratulations, my boy.
We're all proud of you. All of us.

760
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:30,990
The Moose scholarship went
to the right boy-- you.

761
01:02:31,074 --> 01:02:33,224
And we're all proud of you.

762
01:02:34,274 --> 01:02:36,151
We're all done out here.

763
01:02:36,234 --> 01:02:38,828
All done?
What's he mean?

764
01:02:38,914 --> 01:02:43,066
He means we're all done
having loads of fun out here.

765
01:02:43,154 --> 01:02:46,464
You can have all the fun you want.
This place is for fun.

766
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:49,227
Yes, it is.
Thank you. Thank you both.

767
01:02:49,314 --> 01:02:50,508
Good luck, son.

768
01:02:51,754 --> 01:02:55,588
Before I say good-bye, I hope
you'll be taking along with you...

769
01:02:55,674 --> 01:02:57,710
a little piece of this place.

770
01:02:57,794 --> 01:02:59,625
I think I have.

771
01:02:59,714 --> 01:03:01,625
Good. Don't forget us.

772
01:03:01,714 --> 01:03:04,228
No, I won't forget you,
and you won't forget me.

773
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:06,623
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye and good luck.

774
01:03:07,754 --> 01:03:12,145
- It was nice to meet ya.
- What he said goes for me too.

775
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:20,384
You just might make it
as a Pharaoh yet, boy.

776
01:03:20,474 --> 01:03:23,466
Someday he'll make
a fine Moose.

777
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:26,833
What's the matter?

778
01:03:28,794 --> 01:03:30,273
The radio's gone.

779
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:34,754
That means the car is gone!
Come on.

780
01:03:48,994 --> 01:03:51,713
Oh, God! Not the car!

781
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:56,424
Oh, no! Anything!
Not the car!

782
01:04:18,114 --> 01:04:20,469
You know,
it doesn't make sense...

783
01:04:20,554 --> 01:04:23,512
to leave home
to look for home.

784
01:04:23,594 --> 01:04:27,269
To give up a life
to find a new life.

785
01:04:27,354 --> 01:04:30,471
To say good-bye to friends you love
just to find new friends.

786
01:04:30,554 --> 01:04:34,672
- Wait, could you say that again?
- Something Curt said.

787
01:04:34,754 --> 01:04:37,712
Figures.

788
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:40,069
You must 've talked his ear off
tryin' to get him to stay.

789
01:04:40,154 --> 01:04:43,624
No, Steven. That's not true at all.
I didn't say anything.

790
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:46,103
Curt just said at dinner tonight...

791
01:04:46,194 --> 01:04:49,106
that he didn't see
what the big hurry was.

792
01:04:49,194 --> 01:04:52,106
He thought that he ought to stay
and go to J.C. for a while...

793
01:04:52,194 --> 01:04:56,551
and try and figure out
what he wanted to do with his life.

794
01:04:56,634 --> 01:04:59,194
- That sounds logical.
- Do you think so?

795
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:02,266
Sure. I think Curt's
probably right, for Curt.

796
01:05:03,794 --> 01:05:05,671
Not for me, though.

797
01:05:07,514 --> 01:05:09,664
Laurie, look at me.

798
01:05:14,714 --> 01:05:17,547
You know what I want out of life.

799
01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:20,023
And it's just not in this town.

800
01:05:24,274 --> 01:05:27,266
I'm not going with you
to the airport tomorrow.

801
01:05:35,874 --> 01:05:38,468
- No, Steven, don't.
- Come on.

802
01:05:38,794 --> 01:05:41,149
It's our last night together
for three months.

803
01:05:41,234 --> 01:05:43,031
I know. But we've been
through this before.

804
01:05:43,114 --> 01:05:46,026
I'm gonna miss you so much.
I need something to remember you by.

805
01:05:46,114 --> 01:05:48,423
You don't want me
to forget you, do you?

806
01:05:49,034 --> 01:05:50,865
No.

807
01:06:02,914 --> 01:06:05,064
What's wrong?
You're just sitting there.

808
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:07,543
- You want to. Go ahead.
- Not like that.

809
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:10,910
If you're not gonna remember me
for anything else, just go ahead.

810
01:06:10,994 --> 01:06:13,224
Come on.
You want it and you know it.

811
01:06:13,314 --> 01:06:15,191
Don't be so damn
self-righteous with me...

812
01:06:15,274 --> 01:06:18,152
after all that stuff you told me
about watching your brother.

813
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:21,067
You're disgusting!
Get out of my car!

814
01:06:21,154 --> 01:06:24,305
I told you never
to mention that!

815
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:30,872
So, anyhows, the goat killer--

816
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,785
- Can't we talk about something else?
- No.

817
01:06:32,874 --> 01:06:36,150
Whenever he strikes, he leaves
a bloody goat's head next to the victim.

818
01:06:36,234 --> 01:06:38,190
Isn't that creepy?

819
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,154
They thought he went up to Stockton,
but two nights ago...

820
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:44,988
they found the bodies
of Carlie Johnson and Don White...

821
01:06:45,074 --> 01:06:48,271
right here at this canal
all hacked to pieces.

822
01:06:48,434 --> 01:06:50,994
Who do you think 'll take
the regionals this year?

823
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:53,588
Not only were there bloody
goats' heads all around...

824
01:06:53,674 --> 01:06:56,063
but he had switched parts
of their bodies.

825
01:06:56,154 --> 01:07:01,592
She had on his arms
and he had on her legs and--

826
01:07:01,674 --> 01:07:03,346
Wait a second!

827
01:07:04,914 --> 01:07:07,064
Did you hear that?

828
01:07:07,154 --> 01:07:09,110
- Do you think it's the goat killer?
- No!

829
01:07:09,794 --> 01:07:13,469
Listen, I'll go for help
and you stay here.

830
01:07:13,554 --> 01:07:16,148
No, let's get in this field.

831
01:07:16,234 --> 01:07:18,589
Come on, come on!

832
01:07:23,474 --> 01:07:26,511
Maybe if it's the goat killer, he'll get
somebody and we'll see the whole thing.

833
01:07:26,594 --> 01:07:28,425
I don't want to see
the whole thing!

834
01:07:29,274 --> 01:07:31,151
I can't see what he's doing.

835
01:07:31,354 --> 01:07:33,743
Darn it,
I wish I could see.

836
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:37,873
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna see anything.

837
01:07:37,954 --> 01:07:40,263
Just keep him away from me.
That's all I want.

838
01:07:40,354 --> 01:07:42,185
How do I get into these things?

839
01:07:42,274 --> 01:07:43,753
We're all right up--

840
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,232
Debbie?

841
01:08:03,154 --> 01:08:05,110
- Oh, no! Please! Please!
- Terry.

842
01:08:05,554 --> 01:08:07,431
- Steve!
- What are you doin' up here?

843
01:08:07,514 --> 01:08:09,232
Oh, God, Steve.

844
01:08:09,314 --> 01:08:11,270
Is it safe to come out?

845
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:13,424
- Where did you go, anyway?
- Over there.

846
01:08:13,514 --> 01:08:16,074
- Let's get outta here.
- Where's my 'rod?

847
01:08:16,154 --> 01:08:17,985
- Your 'rod?
- Yeah.

848
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:20,872
Did I introduce you?
This is Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve.

849
01:08:22,074 --> 01:08:23,712
Well?

850
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,111
It's in the garage.

851
01:08:27,194 --> 01:08:29,230
I put it in the garage
for safe keeping.

852
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:31,782
I don't want to take any chances
with it.

853
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:35,071
It's a good thing too,
because somebody stole our car.

854
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:39,193
- That's terrible. What kind was it?
- Where's Laurie anyway?

855
01:08:39,274 --> 01:08:42,391
- I guess we broke up.
- You broke up? Bull.

856
01:08:46,754 --> 01:08:48,984
Doesn't look like a gearshift knob.
What is it?

857
01:08:49,074 --> 01:08:52,384
- Come on, give it back to me.
- What's wrong? You're a tough guy.

858
01:08:52,474 --> 01:08:56,626
Go ahead and cream me.
Break my arm. See if I care.

859
01:09:02,754 --> 01:09:04,745
I was just gonna keep it
for a little while.

860
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:06,631
You're an ogre, like my father.

861
01:09:06,714 --> 01:09:10,992
He won't let me stay out late,
or play records, or anything.

862
01:09:11,074 --> 01:09:12,905
Your father won't let you
stay out late?

863
01:09:12,994 --> 01:09:14,825
No, he's terrible.

864
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:18,384
Once I was out late at a party.
He called the cops.

865
01:09:18,474 --> 01:09:22,308
Can you imagine?
He had the whole police force there.

866
01:09:22,394 --> 01:09:25,989
By the way,
where is it that you live, Carol?

867
01:09:26,074 --> 01:09:28,542
Over on Ramona. Why?

868
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:33,265
Oh, no! You thought I'd tell you
where I live?

869
01:09:33,354 --> 01:09:36,346
Not me. Not old Carol.
The night is young.

870
01:09:36,434 --> 01:09:38,902
And I'm not hittin' the rack
till I get a little action.

871
01:09:41,074 --> 01:09:42,348
What do you keep lookin' at?

872
01:09:42,434 --> 01:09:44,470
Who's that? You know him?

873
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:47,990
- He's followin' awful close.
- Grab on to something.

874
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:00,949
Hey, man, I'm sorry
if I scared ya.

875
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:04,549
You'd have to do a hell of a lot
more than that to scare me.

876
01:10:04,674 --> 01:10:07,746
I been lookin' all over for ya.
Didn't nobody tell you?

877
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:11,429
I can't keep track of all you punks
runnin' around here backwards.

878
01:10:11,514 --> 01:10:13,664
You're supposed to be
the fastest thing in the valley.

879
01:10:13,754 --> 01:10:16,552
But that can't be your car.
It must be your mama's car.

880
01:10:16,634 --> 01:10:19,353
I'm sort of embarrassed
to be this close to you.

881
01:10:19,434 --> 01:10:22,153
I'm not surprised,
drivin' a field car.

882
01:10:22,234 --> 01:10:24,111
Field car?
What's a field car?

883
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:28,187
A field car runs through the fields,
drops cow shit all over the place.

884
01:10:28,274 --> 01:10:29,992
That's pretty good.

885
01:10:30,074 --> 01:10:32,986
I like the color of your car, man.
What's that supposed to be?

886
01:10:33,074 --> 01:10:36,510
A cross between piss yellow
and puke green, ain't it?

887
01:10:36,594 --> 01:10:38,903
You call that a paint job,
but it's pretty ugly.

888
01:10:38,994 --> 01:10:42,953
I'll bet you gotta sneak up on the pumps
just to get a little air in your tires.

889
01:10:43,034 --> 01:10:46,470
At least I don't have to pull over
to the side just to let a funeral go by.

890
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:48,829
Funny. You know what?

891
01:10:48,914 --> 01:10:51,303
Your car's uglier than I am!

892
01:10:51,394 --> 01:10:53,305
That didn't come out right.

893
01:10:57,194 --> 01:10:59,424
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Prove it.

894
01:10:59,514 --> 01:11:01,709
Why don't you go out and try
to win yourself a few races?

895
01:11:01,794 --> 01:11:04,388
Then you come on back
and I'll show you a few things.

896
01:11:04,474 --> 01:11:06,749
Race him. You can beat him.

897
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:09,268
That's a tough-lookin' girl
you got with you, man.

898
01:11:09,354 --> 01:11:12,551
Tryin' to pick up
a few extra bucks baby-sittin'?

899
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:16,513
Doll, come and ride with me--
in about ten years!

900
01:11:16,594 --> 01:11:18,710
Leave her out of this.
This is between you and me.

901
01:11:36,554 --> 01:11:38,863
He's really fast, isn't he?

902
01:11:38,954 --> 01:11:40,831
Yeah, but he's stupid.

903
01:11:43,394 --> 01:11:45,988
Any of you guys know a blonde
in a white T-Bird?

904
01:11:46,074 --> 01:11:47,905
I know her.
What about it?

905
01:11:47,994 --> 01:11:50,713
I'm tryin' to find out who she is.

906
01:11:50,794 --> 01:11:53,388
She's out of your price range, man.

907
01:11:53,474 --> 01:11:56,944
- My brother's been out with her.
- Price range?

908
01:11:58,354 --> 01:12:00,072
Are you trying to tell me
she's a prost--

909
01:12:00,154 --> 01:12:03,863
That's right, she's a $30 Sheri.
Can you imagine that?

910
01:12:03,954 --> 01:12:06,991
- Thirty bucks for that broad.
- We're thinkin' about different broads.

911
01:12:07,074 --> 01:12:08,587
Watch it. Fuzz ahead.

912
01:12:08,674 --> 01:12:11,108
- Where?
- At Jerry's Cherry.

913
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,389
You can barely see the fender.

914
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:15,624
Yeah. We oughta do somethin'.

915
01:12:15,714 --> 01:12:19,229
I got an idea.

916
01:12:19,314 --> 01:12:21,191
I got a good idea.

917
01:12:22,354 --> 01:12:24,265
I think I'm gonna
go over to Burger City.

918
01:12:24,354 --> 01:12:26,709
Yeah, Laurie's probably over there.

919
01:12:26,794 --> 01:12:29,513
You think she's got me
worried about where she is, don't you?

920
01:12:29,594 --> 01:12:31,869
I couldn't care less.

921
01:12:31,954 --> 01:12:33,785
- Want to come along?
- Yeah, I do.

922
01:12:33,874 --> 01:12:35,910
- No.
- Make up your minds.

923
01:12:35,994 --> 01:12:39,191
No, thanks.
We got to report the car missing.

924
01:12:39,274 --> 01:12:41,663
All right. I'll see ya.

925
01:12:44,634 --> 01:12:46,909
Shut up! They'll hear us.

926
01:12:50,234 --> 01:12:52,987
- Listen, Carl--
- Curt.

927
01:12:54,794 --> 01:12:58,264
Despite you scratchin' Gil's car,
I like you.

928
01:12:58,354 --> 01:13:00,914
And I know what you'd like
more than anything right now.

929
01:13:01,514 --> 01:13:04,472
Like every guy in this town, you got
the same secret dream, right?

930
01:13:05,474 --> 01:13:08,989
You wanna be a Pharaoh.
Go ahead. You can admit it.

931
01:13:09,074 --> 01:13:11,542
But you didn't think
it was possible, did you?

932
01:13:13,074 --> 01:13:17,226
Well, tonight...

933
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:20,147
I'm gonna give you your chance.

934
01:13:41,314 --> 01:13:42,906
Get down.

935
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:45,824
Okay. Now, you got it?

936
01:13:45,914 --> 01:13:49,827
- I'm stayin' here. You're on your own.
- Wait a minute, Joe.

937
01:13:49,914 --> 01:13:53,111
- What if he hears me?
- Listen, listen!

938
01:13:53,234 --> 01:13:56,670
Look at it this way.
You got three choices.

939
01:13:56,754 --> 01:13:58,631
One, you chicken out.

940
01:13:58,714 --> 01:14:01,433
In that case, I let Ants tie you
to the car and drag you around a bit.

941
01:14:01,514 --> 01:14:03,345
- You don't want that, right?
- No.

942
01:14:03,434 --> 01:14:07,347
Two, you foul up
and Holstein hears you, and, well--

943
01:14:07,434 --> 01:14:10,028
- You don't want that, right?
- No, I don't.

944
01:14:10,114 --> 01:14:14,710
Three, you are successful
and you join the Pharaohs...

945
01:14:14,794 --> 01:14:18,423
with a car coat and
a blood initiation and all that.

946
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:21,347
Wait a minute.
What blood initiation?

947
01:16:03,634 --> 01:16:05,784
Why don't we go get your Jeep?

948
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:08,627
- What are you talking about?
- Your Jeep.

949
01:16:08,714 --> 01:16:13,151
The one you sold the hunting ponies for.
The one with the four-wheel drive.

950
01:16:16,634 --> 01:16:18,306
You sure you got
enough slack?

951
01:16:18,394 --> 01:16:20,385
Yeah, no sweat.
Let's get outta here.

952
01:16:26,434 --> 01:16:28,994
Come on, Terry.

953
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:33,228
Stand by for justice!

954
01:16:47,954 --> 01:16:50,707
I can't believe it,

955
01:16:50,794 --> 01:16:53,672
Feeling so good
'cause you're 16,

956
01:16:58,594 --> 01:17:01,062
Ooh, you come on
like a dream

957
01:17:01,154 --> 01:17:04,863
Peaches and cream
Lips like strawberry wine

958
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,672
You're 16

959
01:17:06,754 --> 01:17:10,224
You're beautiful
and you're mine

960
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:13,949
Why are we stopping here?

961
01:17:14,874 --> 01:17:17,547
- Carol.
- What?

962
01:17:21,074 --> 01:17:24,544
I don't think that I can
control myself any longer.

963
01:17:24,634 --> 01:17:28,229
- You can't?
- I've got to have you.

964
01:17:28,314 --> 01:17:30,270
Me?

965
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:32,584
All night you've been sitting there
and you've been so sexy...

966
01:17:32,674 --> 01:17:35,393
and it's been so hot out here...

967
01:17:35,474 --> 01:17:38,432
and I can't wait any longer.

968
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,185
A lot of that
was an act, you know.

969
01:17:41,274 --> 01:17:44,072
Like my crying.
That was just an act.

970
01:17:44,154 --> 01:17:46,952
It's been building up inside of me
like a volcano all night.

971
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:51,425
If you told me where you lived,
then I could take you home...

972
01:17:51,514 --> 01:17:54,551
but you won't tell me where you live,
so here we are.

973
01:17:54,634 --> 01:17:58,070
I mean, I've got to have you.
It's too late.

974
01:17:58,154 --> 01:17:59,633
It's not too late.
It's never too late!

975
01:17:59,754 --> 01:18:03,064
231 Ramona. Two-three-one.

976
01:18:03,154 --> 01:18:05,588
I'll show you.
It's easy to find.

977
01:18:13,674 --> 01:18:15,630
Hi, Steve.
Mind if I sit down?

978
01:18:15,714 --> 01:18:18,353
No. Have a seat.

979
01:18:18,434 --> 01:18:21,506
Just got five minutes off
and I saw you all alone...

980
01:18:21,594 --> 01:18:23,664
for once.

981
01:18:23,754 --> 01:18:26,666
- Where's Laurie?
- I don't know.

982
01:18:26,754 --> 01:18:29,473
I thought you guys'd be together,
this being your last night.

983
01:18:29,554 --> 01:18:31,863
- We broke up.
- What?

984
01:18:31,954 --> 01:18:34,548
- It's no big deal.
- What happened?

985
01:18:34,634 --> 01:18:36,670
Budda, you got an hour left.
Let's get on it.

986
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,473
All right, all right,
you old fart! Relax!

987
01:18:40,594 --> 01:18:42,471
Listen.

988
01:18:42,554 --> 01:18:46,388
I'm off in an hour, and I thought
you'd maybe like to come over.

989
01:18:50,074 --> 01:18:52,508
- I don't know.
- Well, why not?

990
01:19:09,434 --> 01:19:11,868
This time it'd just be for fun.

991
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,711
Okay?

992
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:19,904
Okay.
I'll see you later, then.

993
01:19:22,074 --> 01:19:23,905
Budda, wait.

994
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:27,383
Listen, I--

995
01:19:27,474 --> 01:19:31,513
I gotta get up early in the morning
and I don't think it'd work out.

996
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:53,911
I tell you somethin'.

997
01:19:53,994 --> 01:19:56,030
That thing jumped about
five feet in the air--

998
01:19:56,114 --> 01:19:57,911
Listen, I still gotta find
that blonde.

999
01:19:58,634 --> 01:20:01,990
Anyway, we'll catch you tomorrow.

1000
01:20:02,074 --> 01:20:03,712
I guess so. I don't know.

1001
01:20:03,794 --> 01:20:05,625
What do you mean,
you guess so?

1002
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:08,467
We don't admit a lot of guys
to the Pharaohs.

1003
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:11,387
We got to steal your car coat,
things like that.

1004
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,305
You gotta
make up your mind.

1005
01:20:13,474 --> 01:20:17,069
Rome wasn't burned
in a night.

1006
01:20:21,314 --> 01:20:23,225
- Let's go!
- I'll see you, boys.

1007
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:53,270
You only got about five minutes
if you want to talk to the Wolfman,

1008
01:20:53,354 --> 01:20:56,869
Gonna make all your dreams
come true, baby, Hello!

1009
01:20:56,954 --> 01:21:00,708
Would you dedicate a record
to keep me and my girlfriend together?

1010
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:03,786
- Are you separated?
- We're havin' a little problem,

1011
01:21:03,874 --> 01:21:06,513
I'll bring you right together,
Hold on a minute, man,

1012
01:21:10,114 --> 01:21:12,503
Everything's gonna be
allright now, man, understand?

1013
01:21:12,594 --> 01:21:16,746
I chased the evil spirits away,
Now let me play the record for ya,

1014
01:22:17,434 --> 01:22:19,470
Hey, baby.
What do you say?

1015
01:22:22,554 --> 01:22:25,227
Don't say anything
and we'll get along just fine.

1016
01:22:34,234 --> 01:22:36,794
This is the first time
you've been quiet all night.

1017
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:39,388
I had fun. Good-bye.

1018
01:22:40,314 --> 01:22:41,827
Bye.

1019
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:47,429
- Do you like me?
- Yeah, I like you. You're all right.

1020
01:22:47,554 --> 01:22:49,226
But I mean do you like me?

1021
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:55,231
I like you.

1022
01:22:59,634 --> 01:23:01,590
Okay?

1023
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:04,344
Couldn't I have something
to remember you by?

1024
01:23:20,154 --> 01:23:22,304
- Bye, kid.
- Gee, thanks!

1025
01:23:22,394 --> 01:23:25,864
It's just like a ring or something.
It's like we were going steady.

1026
01:23:25,954 --> 01:23:28,149
Wait 'll I tell Marcia
and everybody!

1027
01:23:28,234 --> 01:23:31,431
- Don't go overboard with this thing.
- I'll see you around.

1028
01:23:45,034 --> 01:23:48,265
I haven't cried so much,
Tears and everything, man,

1029
01:23:48,354 --> 01:23:51,710
I leaned towards the microphone,
I almost shorted myself out!

1030
01:23:53,074 --> 01:23:56,987
- Hold that up.
- You're right about that.

1031
01:23:57,074 --> 01:24:00,703
But why should I leave home
to find a home?

1032
01:24:00,794 --> 01:24:03,831
Why should I leave friends that I love
to find new friends?

1033
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:06,030
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I've heard this already.

1034
01:24:06,114 --> 01:24:09,550
Aren't you the one that told me
for eight weeks...

1035
01:24:09,634 --> 01:24:11,750
that you have to leave
the nest sometime?

1036
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,665
I realize that.

1037
01:24:13,754 --> 01:24:16,222
No "realizing."
You've been telling me all summer...

1038
01:24:16,314 --> 01:24:19,590
that it's time to stick your head
out of the sand...

1039
01:24:19,674 --> 01:24:23,223
and take a look at the big,
beautiful world out there somewhere.

1040
01:24:23,314 --> 01:24:26,272
Gimme this thing.
I feel like a midwife.

1041
01:24:26,354 --> 01:24:28,265
I may have been wrong,
Curt.

1042
01:24:28,354 --> 01:24:30,663
Wrong, nothing!
You've been telling me for eight weeks.

1043
01:24:30,754 --> 01:24:32,870
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, I know.

1044
01:24:32,954 --> 01:24:34,945
You're just mentally
playing with yourself.

1045
01:24:35,034 --> 01:24:37,787
Just relax and we'll talk about it
at the airport.

1046
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,190
Where're you going?

1047
01:24:41,274 --> 01:24:43,708
It's awfully early in the morning.

1048
01:24:43,794 --> 01:24:46,228
- I have a dental appointment.
- Come on, Curt.

1049
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:49,750
Just relax, will ya?
I'll see you at the airport.

1050
01:24:59,554 --> 01:25:03,183
Some enchanted evening

1051
01:25:03,274 --> 01:25:07,153
You will see a stranger

1052
01:25:07,234 --> 01:25:10,431
You will see a stranger

1053
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:14,792
Across a crowded room

1054
01:25:14,874 --> 01:25:18,025
And suddenly you'll know

1055
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:21,424
That she is the one

1056
01:25:29,954 --> 01:25:34,425
- He mustn't have been used to drinking.
- No. He likes to drink. He told me so.

1057
01:25:38,034 --> 01:25:40,673
I knew a man once
who got that sick.

1058
01:25:40,754 --> 01:25:43,791
Billy Weber.
That was ten years ago.

1059
01:25:43,874 --> 01:25:48,789
On his hands and knees like that
he looks like a dog, like old Ginger.

1060
01:25:48,874 --> 01:25:52,025
Sicker'n a dog,
that's for sure.

1061
01:25:56,914 --> 01:25:59,986
- Are you all right?
- Oh, rats.

1062
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:03,224
I feel terrible.

1063
01:26:08,154 --> 01:26:10,793
The car!
Debbie, look!

1064
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,388
Debbie, that's the car!

1065
01:26:13,474 --> 01:26:15,544
Look. It's sitting right here.

1066
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:21,630
- Are you sure this is it?
- Yeah, sure. This is it.

1067
01:26:25,314 --> 01:26:27,305
They must've taken
the keys with 'em.

1068
01:26:27,394 --> 01:26:30,033
- Maybe we better go call the police.
- No. Wait a minute.

1069
01:26:30,114 --> 01:26:33,390
I got a better idea.
We'll just steal it back, all right?

1070
01:26:33,474 --> 01:26:36,193
You get some wire-- about a foot.
We can hot-wire it.

1071
01:26:54,314 --> 01:26:57,192
Took the header plugs off?
Expectin' some action?

1072
01:26:57,274 --> 01:27:00,152
Yeah, I think so.
There's some punk lookin' for me.

1073
01:27:00,234 --> 01:27:03,704
Why the hell do they bother?
You've always been number one.

1074
01:27:07,554 --> 01:27:10,193
Been a long time, ain't it?
I'll see you. Thanks.

1075
01:27:28,194 --> 01:27:30,071
Hi, this is my car.

1076
01:27:31,754 --> 01:27:34,507
What I mean is,
somebody stole--

1077
01:27:34,594 --> 01:27:36,710
No, I mean, I lost my car, see?

1078
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:39,831
And I want to thank
you two guys for retur--

1079
01:27:39,914 --> 01:27:43,031
I mean, now listen.
Now, listen, guys.

1080
01:27:43,114 --> 01:27:47,505
I've been sick, and this kind of
activity can really be hard on a guy.

1081
01:27:47,594 --> 01:27:49,710
Easy. Easy.

1082
01:27:53,354 --> 01:27:54,946
Stop it! Stop it!

1083
01:27:56,994 --> 01:27:59,383
Help! Police! Help!

1084
01:28:00,234 --> 01:28:02,190
Stop it, you creeps!

1085
01:28:20,114 --> 01:28:22,753
- Go, John!
- Get him!

1086
01:28:25,794 --> 01:28:27,750
Come on, get up!
Come on!

1087
01:28:30,794 --> 01:28:33,433
What the hell's
going on here, Toad?

1088
01:28:33,514 --> 01:28:35,345
Man, are you all right?

1089
01:28:35,434 --> 01:28:38,028
Yeah, I'll die soon
and it'll all be over, John.

1090
01:28:38,114 --> 01:28:40,503
Wow, you're just
like the Lone Ranger!

1091
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:43,748
Listen--
Are you with him?

1092
01:28:43,834 --> 01:28:46,189
You're talking
to the woman I love.

1093
01:28:46,274 --> 01:28:48,105
What happened, man?

1094
01:28:58,514 --> 01:29:00,664
- Hi, Steve.
- Hi, Judy. Hi, Karen.

1095
01:29:00,834 --> 01:29:02,586
Where's Laurie?

1096
01:29:04,874 --> 01:29:06,830
We know where she is.

1097
01:29:06,914 --> 01:29:08,745
So what?

1098
01:29:08,834 --> 01:29:10,108
So nothing.

1099
01:29:10,194 --> 01:29:12,708
It's just that she was
with a really cute guy...

1100
01:29:12,794 --> 01:29:14,830
in a really boss car.

1101
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:17,667
And we thought you just
might know who it was.

1102
01:29:18,954 --> 01:29:21,752
- I'm sorry, but I wouldn't know.
- We know.

1103
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:23,745
His name's Bob Falfa.

1104
01:29:33,794 --> 01:29:36,024
Bring two cherry Cokes
with lots of ice.

1105
01:29:36,114 --> 01:29:38,708
No, never mind.
Just bring the ice. Pronto.

1106
01:29:38,794 --> 01:29:40,432
Out! Out!
Get out of the car.

1107
01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:42,550
Steve, what are you doin'?

1108
01:29:42,634 --> 01:29:44,989
Just get out and shut up.
You too. Get out. Get out!

1109
01:29:45,074 --> 01:29:48,032
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

1110
01:29:55,834 --> 01:29:57,665
I can't believe it.

1111
01:29:57,754 --> 01:29:59,949
You practically get killed
trying to get your car back...

1112
01:30:00,034 --> 01:30:01,831
then you let him have it.

1113
01:30:01,914 --> 01:30:04,269
It's not my car.

1114
01:30:04,354 --> 01:30:06,470
What?

1115
01:30:06,554 --> 01:30:08,351
It is not my car.

1116
01:30:09,674 --> 01:30:11,630
Well, then,
where is your car?

1117
01:30:13,354 --> 01:30:15,265
I don't have a car.

1118
01:30:15,354 --> 01:30:18,346
What about your Jeep?

1119
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:21,346
How am I gonna get home?

1120
01:30:26,114 --> 01:30:29,151
Where's your car?
I have to hang 'em on a car.

1121
01:30:30,154 --> 01:30:31,872
I need a ride.

1122
01:30:35,114 --> 01:30:38,584
Toad, what happened to you?
Did you lose your car again?

1123
01:30:38,674 --> 01:30:40,824
No, Steve took it.

1124
01:30:42,954 --> 01:30:45,104
I want to go to sleep.

1125
01:30:45,194 --> 01:30:47,788
You got to take it easy
When you drive that car of yours,

1126
01:30:47,874 --> 01:30:50,229
You've got to cruise easy,
baby,

1127
01:30:50,314 --> 01:30:53,863
Don't be doin' any accidents
or anything on me now,

1128
01:30:53,954 --> 01:30:56,024
You know, Terry?

1129
01:30:56,114 --> 01:30:58,070
I had a pretty good time tonight.

1130
01:30:58,154 --> 01:31:01,066
- Come on. You're just--
- No, no. Really, really.

1131
01:31:01,154 --> 01:31:03,224
I really had a good time.

1132
01:31:03,314 --> 01:31:06,511
I mean, you picked me up
and we got some hard stuff...

1133
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,711
saw a holdup
and then we went to the canal.

1134
01:31:09,794 --> 01:31:11,989
You got your car stolen.

1135
01:31:12,074 --> 01:31:14,713
And then I got to watch you
get sick.

1136
01:31:14,794 --> 01:31:17,945
Then you got
in this really bitchin' fight.

1137
01:31:18,034 --> 01:31:21,390
I really had a good time.

1138
01:31:21,474 --> 01:31:24,910
Well, I guess I have a pretty good time
just about every night.

1139
01:31:24,994 --> 01:31:27,349
If I'm not doing
anything tomorrow...

1140
01:31:27,434 --> 01:31:30,346
why don't you give me
a call, okay?

1141
01:31:30,434 --> 01:31:32,265
Yeah, all right.

1142
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:35,152
I got a little Vespa I play around with.
Maybe, you know--

1143
01:31:35,234 --> 01:31:37,748
Really?
Well, that's almost a motorcycle...

1144
01:31:37,834 --> 01:31:40,587
and I just love motorcycles.

1145
01:31:40,674 --> 01:31:42,983
You do?
Why didn't you say something earlier?

1146
01:31:43,074 --> 01:31:44,905
We wouldn't have had
to go through all the fun.

1147
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:47,708
I gotta go.

1148
01:31:52,194 --> 01:31:54,344
- Good night.
- See ya.

1149
01:32:55,714 --> 01:32:57,830
Hey, what do you want?

1150
01:32:57,914 --> 01:33:00,667
Push the red switch down.

1151
01:33:04,594 --> 01:33:06,425
I'm looking for this girl.

1152
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:08,789
Yeah. Aren't we all?

1153
01:33:08,874 --> 01:33:10,705
She's not here.

1154
01:33:10,794 --> 01:33:13,911
Come on in the back.

1155
01:33:13,994 --> 01:33:17,191
You just go around the back.
This way.

1156
01:33:28,834 --> 01:33:31,667
Have a popsicle. The ice box just
broke down and they're melting.

1157
01:33:31,754 --> 01:33:33,665
- You want one?
- No, no, thanks.

1158
01:33:33,754 --> 01:33:36,552
- Listen--
- Have a popsicle.

1159
01:33:36,634 --> 01:33:38,431
Are you the Wolfman?

1160
01:33:39,794 --> 01:33:41,591
No, man.
I'm not the Wolfman.

1161
01:33:44,634 --> 01:33:46,431
Wait a minute.

1162
01:33:54,554 --> 01:33:57,227
Who is this
on the Wolfman's telephone?

1163
01:33:58,554 --> 01:34:00,863
That's the Wolfman.

1164
01:34:00,954 --> 01:34:02,353
He's on tape.

1165
01:34:03,354 --> 01:34:04,753
The man is on tape.

1166
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:09,703
Where is he now?
I mean, where does he work?

1167
01:34:10,714 --> 01:34:12,784
The Wolfman is everywhere.

1168
01:34:15,674 --> 01:34:17,505
I gotta give him this note.
Shit!

1169
01:34:20,874 --> 01:34:22,910
Here, let me see the note.

1170
01:34:27,834 --> 01:34:30,826
Hell, that's just a dedication, man.
What I can do is relay it.

1171
01:34:30,914 --> 01:34:35,066
- It'll be on tomorrow or Tuesday.
- No, no, this is very important.

1172
01:34:35,154 --> 01:34:38,112
I may be leaving town
tomorrow and it's very important...

1173
01:34:38,194 --> 01:34:42,107
that I reach this girl right now.

1174
01:34:42,194 --> 01:34:45,231
You don't know whether
you're going to leave town or not?

1175
01:34:46,034 --> 01:34:48,832
I'm supposed to go to college
back east tomorrow.

1176
01:34:48,914 --> 01:34:52,304
And I don't know
if I'm going to go. I don't know.

1177
01:34:52,914 --> 01:34:56,190
Wait a minute.
Have a popsicle.

1178
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:58,310
- No, thanks.
- Sit down a minute.

1179
01:34:58,394 --> 01:35:01,511
- It's early in the morning.
- Damn.

1180
01:35:02,714 --> 01:35:04,545
I can't talk
for the Wolfman...

1181
01:35:04,634 --> 01:35:06,864
but I can tell you one thing.

1182
01:35:08,634 --> 01:35:11,546
If the Wolfman was here,
he'd say, "Get your ass in gear."

1183
01:35:13,234 --> 01:35:15,225
The Wolfman comes in here
occasionally...

1184
01:35:15,314 --> 01:35:18,511
bringing tapes, you know,
to check up on me and what not.

1185
01:35:18,594 --> 01:35:21,154
And the places he talks about
that he's been...

1186
01:35:21,234 --> 01:35:23,065
the things he's seen.

1187
01:35:23,154 --> 01:35:26,191
It's a great big beautiful world
out there.

1188
01:35:26,274 --> 01:35:28,993
And here I sit...

1189
01:35:29,074 --> 01:35:32,111
sucking on popsicles.

1190
01:35:32,234 --> 01:35:33,826
Why don't you leave?

1191
01:35:33,914 --> 01:35:35,711
I'm not a young man anymore.

1192
01:35:37,594 --> 01:35:41,348
The Wolfman gave me my start
in the business, and I like it.

1193
01:35:41,434 --> 01:35:43,789
I tell you what.

1194
01:35:43,874 --> 01:35:46,308
If I can possibly do it tonight...

1195
01:35:46,394 --> 01:35:48,908
I'll try to relay
this dedication in...

1196
01:35:48,994 --> 01:35:51,269
and get it on the air
for you later on.

1197
01:35:51,354 --> 01:35:55,347
That would be terrific.
Really. Thanks.

1198
01:35:55,434 --> 01:35:57,186
Just a minute.

1199
01:35:59,394 --> 01:36:02,113
- It's been a pleasure, really.
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

1200
01:36:02,194 --> 01:36:04,708
Sticky little mothers, ain't they?

1201
01:36:04,794 --> 01:36:06,625
Six or seven of them, right?

1202
01:36:06,714 --> 01:36:09,433
I know. I got a whole
refrigerator full.

1203
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:11,789
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- See you later.

1204
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:22,072
Rock on, baby,
We gonna do it right here,

1205
01:36:22,154 --> 01:36:24,190
Rock 'n' roll
Yourself to death,

1206
01:36:24,274 --> 01:36:26,310
Oh, mercy!

1207
01:36:26,394 --> 01:36:28,908
Give me some more!
My, my,

1208
01:36:42,394 --> 01:36:44,464
John, let me go with you.
Come on.

1209
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:49,473
Nah, man, I can't take you
when I'm racin' somebody.

1210
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:52,864
Just let me go. I just want to watch.
Or I'll flag you, okay?

1211
01:36:52,954 --> 01:36:54,546
All right. Go ahead.

1212
01:36:58,714 --> 01:37:00,944
Paradise Road.

1213
01:37:05,474 --> 01:37:07,863
Where's this Paradise Road?

1214
01:37:07,954 --> 01:37:11,185
Just follow this street
straight out of town.

1215
01:37:11,274 --> 01:37:15,552
If you're going to race John Milner,
let me out when we get there.

1216
01:37:15,634 --> 01:37:19,707
Why don't you shut up, baby?
You ain't said one word all night long.

1217
01:37:19,794 --> 01:37:21,466
You're a weird broad.

1218
01:37:21,554 --> 01:37:24,307
But you're gonna
appreciate me soon.

1219
01:37:24,394 --> 01:37:27,909
You'll be hanging on for mercy
when I get this sucker rollin'.

1220
01:37:38,114 --> 01:37:39,945
Headin' out to Paradise Road?

1221
01:37:40,034 --> 01:37:41,911
Paradise Road?

1222
01:37:41,994 --> 01:37:44,588
Some guy named Falfa's
goin' up against Milner.

1223
01:37:44,674 --> 01:37:46,869
- He's racing Falfa?
- Yeah.

1224
01:37:46,954 --> 01:37:51,266
Figured something's up. Saw 'em head
out of town real cautious-like and--

1225
01:37:58,554 --> 01:38:01,546
I got a dedication here
for a friend of the old Wolfman,

1226
01:38:01,634 --> 01:38:03,750
He wants me to play
the next song,,,

1227
01:38:03,834 --> 01:38:06,712
for a blonde young lady
in a Thunderbird,

1228
01:38:06,794 --> 01:38:09,183
A white T-Bird,
you understand,

1229
01:38:09,274 --> 01:38:12,550
My friend's name is Curt
And he wants to talk to you, baby,

1230
01:38:12,634 --> 01:38:14,943
So you meet him at BurgerCity,,,

1231
01:38:15,034 --> 01:38:17,992
or you can phone
Diamond-3132,

1232
01:38:18,074 --> 01:38:19,905
He's a friend of mine, you hear?

1233
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:23,987
Little girl, you better call him
or the Wolfman gonna get ya,

1234
01:38:50,994 --> 01:38:53,713
Laurie, what in the hell
are you doing in there?

1235
01:38:53,794 --> 01:38:56,911
- Is she gonna ride with you?
- Mind your own business, John.

1236
01:38:56,994 --> 01:39:00,748
Yeah, she's going with me.
You take care of yourself, man.

1237
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:02,950
You guys ready?

1238
01:39:50,154 --> 01:39:52,384
You son of a bitch!

1239
01:40:04,674 --> 01:40:06,505
Come on, she's gonna blow.

1240
01:40:06,594 --> 01:40:09,472
I don't know.
Please, don't come near me.

1241
01:40:09,554 --> 01:40:11,351
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, Steven.

1242
01:40:18,034 --> 01:40:21,106
Oh, Steven!
Please don't leave me.

1243
01:40:21,194 --> 01:40:23,105
- Don't leave me, please.
- I won't.

1244
01:40:23,194 --> 01:40:25,264
I couldn't bear it.
Please.

1245
01:40:25,354 --> 01:40:27,185
I'm not gonna leave you.

1246
01:40:27,274 --> 01:40:29,265
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Promise me.

1247
01:40:29,354 --> 01:40:31,026
- I promise.
- Do you?

1248
01:40:33,234 --> 01:40:34,906
I'm not gonna leave you.

1249
01:40:47,274 --> 01:40:50,072
That was beautiful, John.
Just beautiful.

1250
01:40:51,434 --> 01:40:55,063
- I was losin', man.
- What?

1251
01:40:57,034 --> 01:41:00,151
He was pulling away from me
just before he crashed.

1252
01:41:00,234 --> 01:41:04,307
You're crazy! You creamed him
from right off the line.

1253
01:41:04,394 --> 01:41:07,192
Shit, Toad! The man had me.
He was beatin' me.

1254
01:41:07,274 --> 01:41:09,583
John, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1255
01:41:09,674 --> 01:41:11,983
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1256
01:41:12,074 --> 01:41:14,986
He might as well get a wheelchair
and roll himself home.

1257
01:41:15,074 --> 01:41:17,383
Man, you got the bitchinest car
in the valley.

1258
01:41:17,474 --> 01:41:20,272
You'll always be number one.
You're the greatest.

1259
01:41:25,674 --> 01:41:27,904
Look at your glasses, man.

1260
01:41:29,594 --> 01:41:32,108
Okay, Toad.

1261
01:41:32,194 --> 01:41:34,469
We'll take 'em all.

1262
01:41:34,554 --> 01:41:37,227
- All right.
- We'll take 'em.

1263
01:41:37,314 --> 01:41:39,384
Let's get out of here.

1264
01:41:39,474 --> 01:41:41,305
Jesus, what a night!

1265
01:42:18,794 --> 01:42:21,752
- Curt?
- Yes! Yes. This is Curt.

1266
01:42:21,834 --> 01:42:25,588
- Who are you?
- Who were you expecting?

1267
01:42:25,674 --> 01:42:28,586
- Do you drive a white T-Bird?
- A white '56,

1268
01:42:28,674 --> 01:42:30,551
I saw you on Third Street,

1269
01:42:32,834 --> 01:42:34,028
Who are you?
Do you know me?

1270
01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:35,866
Of course!

1271
01:42:36,034 --> 01:42:39,231
- How do you know me?
- It's not important,

1272
01:42:39,314 --> 01:42:41,953
It's important!
It's important to me.

1273
01:42:42,034 --> 01:42:45,071
You're the most beautiful, exciting
thing I've ever seen in my life...

1274
01:42:45,154 --> 01:42:47,304
and I don't know anything
about you.

1275
01:42:47,394 --> 01:42:50,306
Listen, listen--

1276
01:42:50,394 --> 01:42:53,545
- Could we meet someplace?
- I cruise Third Street,

1277
01:42:53,634 --> 01:42:55,943
Maybe l'll see you tonight,

1278
01:42:56,034 --> 01:42:58,025
No, I don't think so.

1279
01:42:58,994 --> 01:43:01,144
Tell me your name!
At least tell me your name!

1280
01:43:01,234 --> 01:43:03,543
- Good-bye, Curt,
- Wait a minute!

1281
01:43:06,114 --> 01:43:08,912
Little kiss on you rear,
Good night, sweet heart,

1282
01:43:08,994 --> 01:43:11,064
I'll see you later,

1283
01:43:11,154 --> 01:43:13,588
Oh, The Spaniels,

1284
01:43:21,154 --> 01:43:24,066
Good-bye, son.
Call us when you get there.

1285
01:43:28,354 --> 01:43:30,345
I'll miss you.

1286
01:43:34,434 --> 01:43:36,265
Good luck.

1287
01:43:36,354 --> 01:43:38,504
Same to you.

1288
01:43:38,594 --> 01:43:41,188
- Am I gonna see you there next year?
- I'll be there.

1289
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:49,745
Bye-bye, Curt.

1290
01:43:56,274 --> 01:43:57,992
Stay cool, man.

1291
01:43:59,754 --> 01:44:01,949
And don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

1292
01:44:02,794 --> 01:44:04,386
I'll see you, buddy.

1293
01:44:06,754 --> 01:44:10,827
You probably think you're a big shot
going off like this.

1294
01:44:11,994 --> 01:44:14,030
But you're still a punk.

1295
01:44:14,114 --> 01:44:16,264
Okay, John.

1296
01:44:17,234 --> 01:44:19,828
- So long.
- So long!

1297
01:44:25,594 --> 01:44:27,232
Have a good trip.
