{388}{425}Hi.| subtitle from www.napiszone.prv.pl
{426}{481}My name's Jimmy Livingston.
{482}{543}My mom says when I was born...
{544}{611}I came gift-wrapped|from Heaven.
{612}{656}Aaah!
{798}{836}Whoa! Whoa!
{837}{911}Well,|I guess this is growing up
{912}{975}My first memories|are kind of hazy.
{976}{1055}All I remember is|a place with white walls...
{1056}{1130}bright lights,|and a gigantic bird.
{1164}{1243}I was there because I was born|with no immunities.
{1244}{1300}A single germ could kill me.
{1301}{1405}But when I was four,|my mom took me home...
{1406}{1478}to beautiful|Palmdale, California.
{1509}{1578}Mom helped me|make friends right away.
{1640}{1685}Let's go.
{1685}{1739}Get him in!
{1840}{1901}Our house was enormous|like a castle...
{1902}{1987}and for the first time,|I felt completely free.
{1988}{2021}There.
{2022}{2168}Now you're safe from|that evil, filthy world.
{2169}{2242}You're home, Jimmy!
{2243}{2379}And you'll never, ever, ever|have to go out there again.
{2750}{2812}Look at that.
{2813}{2865}Look what Mommy made for Jimmy.
{2973}{3031}I had a big room|with my own bed...
{3032}{3063}Lots of toys...
{3064}{3132}and two pairs|of retractable arms.
{3133}{3215}"And the prince climbed to|the top of the tower and said...
{3216}{3248}'Come with me...
{3249}{3288}and we'll live|happily ever after.'
{3289}{3408}"And Rapunzel left|her plastic bubble and died."
{3409}{3459}The End.
{3460}{3517}Those evil doctors.
{3563}{3657}Nobody's gonna get any germs|on my little boy now.
{3658}{3708}You'll always stay pure.
{3709}{3746}Won't you, Jimmy?
{3842}{3893}Jimmy! Breakfie!
{3894}{3926}I had my reading.
{3926}{3992}I wish they had more than|one magazine in the world, Mom.
{3993}{4029}So do l, dear.
{4030}{4085}My favorite TV show,|"Land of the Lost. "
{4086}{4130}I wish TVs had more|than one channel, Mom.
{4131}{4173}So do l, dear.
{4174}{4209}And I had|the best teacher...
{4210}{4244}in the whole, wide world.
{4245}{4269}And then the Indians...
{4270}{4314}decided to move|to the reservations...
{4315}{4346}where they|could open casinos...
{4347}{4385}and sell|tax-free cigarettes...
{4386}{4437}and stay out of|the white man's way.
{4438}{4501}Another A-plus.
{4502}{4570}The neighborhood kids always|wanted to hang at my house.
{4570}{4603}Lives in a bubble,|smells like poop
{4634}{4661}Bubble boy, bubble boy
{4702}{4774}Get out of here,|you little buggers! Go on!
{4775}{4805}But I liked|to hang with my dad.
{4806}{4848}Holy mother of shit, Morton!
{4849}{4893}Are you trying to kill|him with that thing?
{4999}{5055}Jimmy, lunchie.
{5150}{5192}|Suppertime was the best.
{5193}{5238}Nothing could beat Mom's|homemade, vitamin-rich...
{5239}{5302}soy-based, germ-free,|fat-free fiber cookies.
{5303}{5369}Mmm. Mm-hmm.
{5399}{5456}I grew up|like any other kid.
{5457}{5502}At 16,|I didn't get a car...
{5503}{5569}but I did get an electrical|rock-music guitar!
{5570}{5654}I can't|believe the things I found
{5655}{5740}I need to find my way
{5741}{5789}I'm lost, I'm lost
{5790}{5856}I do believe I'm living
{5857}{5896}In the Land
{5897}{5950}Of the Lost
{5983}{6041}I'm living in the Land
{6075}{6131}Living in the Land
{6158}{6221}Living in the Land
{6222}{6274}Of the Lost
{6275}{6318}I was so happy.
{6319}{6374}I had everything|a boy could ever want.
{6409}{6459}Until...
{6490}{6526}Chloe.
{6626}{6689}"And then Pinocchio came out|of his plastic bubble...
{6690}{6746}"touched the filthy little|whore next door and died."
{6747}{6794}The End.
{6795}{6834}Ooh, baby
{6913}{6978}Ahh
{6979}{7010}Oh, yeah
{7011}{7066}|Over the next few years...
{7067}{7135}I washed my window a lot.
{7187}{7222}Oh, my
{7223}{7289}Something|was happening to me.
{7290}{7323}But I didn't know what.
{7472}{7502}Mom!
{7503}{7563}-Jimmy! What's the matter?|-Mom!
{7563}{7594}Are you all right?
{7595}{7639}-What is it?|-Oh! Oh, my God!
{7640}{7663}Ow!
{7664}{7718}Don't touch it! Hands off!
{7719}{7766}Now, just relax,|don't get upset.
{7767}{7790}It hurts!
{7791}{7815}Just do what|I tell your father--
{7816}{7854}just say the pledge|of allegiance...
{7855}{7918}until it goes away.|Come on!
{7919}{7970}I pledge allegiance|to the flag...
{7971}{8010}of the United States|of America...
{8011}{8041}and to the republic|for which it stands...
{8042}{8085}one nation under God,|indivisible...
{8086}{8141}with liberty and justice|for all.
{8186}{8219}I pledge allegiance|to the flag...
{8220}{8249}of the United States|of America...
{8250}{8305}and to the republic|for which it stands...
{8306}{8369}one nation under God...
{8370}{8422}Thanks, Mom.
{8477}{8513}Can't touch this
{8556}{8596}Can't touch this...
{8748}{8779}Dude!
{8780}{8820}You live next door|to the bubble boy.
{8821}{8860}Know what I heard?
{8861}{8915}The only thing he can drink|is his own urine.
{8916}{8959}True story. Swear to God.
{8960}{9002}I heard the same thing, man.|It's gross.
{9003}{9058}Then what did he drink|to make the urine?
{9059}{9120}Well, it would...
{9121}{9166}Tell her.
{9167}{9199}Shotgun!
{9272}{9304}He's not a monster, you guys.
{9305}{9340}He's just a boy in a bubble.
{9340}{9426}I am not a monster.|I'm a human being.
{9427}{9482}-Bye, Lisa.|-Bye, Chloe.
{9483}{9521}I wish I was the boy|in her bubble.
{9522}{9564}Oh, yeah!
{9613}{9663}Let's hit the arcade.
{10013}{10065}Hi, Mr. Livingston?
{10066}{10125}I'm Chloe.|I live...next door.
{10661}{10696}Hyah!
{11336}{11371}Oh, my gosh!
{11372}{11409}-What?|-Are you OK?
{11410}{11477}What?|Wait, no, no, no.
{11478}{11519}I was just playing.
{11520}{11557}I was just playing.
{11558}{11660}Mayday! You know, that.
{11661}{11719}Oh.
{11720}{11787}Ahem.
{11788}{11839}Was that Pakuni|you were speaking?
{11840}{11890}From "Land of the Lost"?
{11891}{11952}I love "Land of the Lost."
{11953}{11980}I love you, too.
{11981}{12060}It! It, too.|I love it, too.
{12101}{12149}-I'm Jimmy.|-I'm--
{12150}{12188}Chloe, the whore next door.
{12189}{12221}What?
{12222}{12270}Where did you hear that?
{12271}{12342}My mom.|She teaches me everything.
{12343}{12395}Well, really she got it wrong.
{12396}{12469}I'm actually more of a bitch|than a whore.
{12470}{12553}A bitch. Oh, yeah.
{12553}{12625}A bitch.|Absolutely, a bitch.
{12662}{12749}Yeah.
{12750}{12785}You play guitar?
{12786}{12856}Oh, yeah!
{12857}{12896}Do you wanna try it?
{12897}{12936}Oh, no, I don't know how.
{12937}{12969}I could teach you.
{12970}{13003}Right now.
{13004}{13066}I can't right now.
{13113}{13148}I should go.
{13298}{13352}How about tomorrow?
{13353}{13409}Oh, jeez, I don't know.
{13410}{13493}I don't know, bitch.|I got a lot to do.
{13494}{13569}See you tomorrow. Bye.
{13638}{13717}She's certainly proud of|those boobies, isn't she?
{13785}{13816}Something tells me she's not...
{13817}{13881}the kind of friend|Jesus would pick, Jimmy.
{13882}{13945}When I look
{13946}{14029}All a--round
{14030}{14062}Oh, I suck.
{14062}{14120}No, no. Come here.
{14204}{14247}You have to press harder.
{14248}{14284}-OK.|-Harder. Here.
{14285}{14376}-Like...|-Now go. Harder.
{14377}{14437}When I look
{14438}{14530}All around
{14531}{14573}I pledge allegiance to the flag|of the United States of America
{14574}{14607}and to the republic|for which it stands...
{14608}{14635}one nation under God...
{14636}{14694}Everything OK?
{14694}{14731}Yeah. Let's go.
{14732}{14769}|Wouldn't it be nice
{14770}{14817}If we were older
{14818}{14905}And we wouldn't have|to wait so long
{14906}{14997}And wouldn't it be nice|to live together
{14998}{15116}In the kind of world|where we belong
{15118}{15212}I know it's gonna make it|that much better
{15214}{15251}When we can say good night...
{15252}{15305}Trick or treat!
{15306}{15349}Smell my feet!
{15350}{15411}Oh, hey!
{15412}{15472}Aah!
{15473}{15556}In the morning|when the day is new...
{15681}{15728}It's Bubble Guinea.
{15762}{15804}Oh, my God!
{15805}{15848}Hi, Bubble Guinea.
{15887}{15926}Jimmy!
{15956}{16017}Ow! Ah!
{16018}{16084}Stupid gutter.
{16085}{16210}Jimmy! Ah! Ouch.

{16299}{16371}Yeah. Bubble Boy!
{16372}{16419}What about your party?
{16420}{16510}Jimmy, you have to wish me|happy birthday.
{16511}{16558}What about your party?
{16559}{16617}Uhh, the party.
{16618}{16653}I'll show you a party.
{16655}{16691}Come here.
{16692}{16738}-Don't be shy.|-Huh?
{16739}{16777}Come here.
{16778}{16821}My mom's asleep.
{16822}{16866}Don't you wanna give me|a birthday kiss?
{16867}{16941}Chloe. Heh heh. Shh.
{16942}{16990}Shh.
{16991}{17077}Whoa! Oh, Chloe!
{17078}{17127}|I hate this stupid bubble.
{17128}{17166}I got everything|I wanted for my birthday...
{17167}{17205}except you, Jimmy.
{17206}{17241}That's why I'm coming in.

{17302}{17397}Don't worry.|You can decontaminate me.
{17398}{17466}-Hee hee hee.|-What?
{17467}{17522}Relax. Have a beer.
{17547}{17634}Wait, um, wait. Chloe?
{17671}{17726}I'm not so sure|that's such a good idea.
{17727}{17782}Jimmy.

{17878}{17917}Oh, baby
{17918}{17955}Please?
{17996}{18042}Ahh
{18524}{18608}Chloe?
{18609}{18649}I...
{18650}{18694}Maybe|I should have let her in...
{18695}{18761}but I was scared.
{18762}{18824}So who could really blame her|for what happened next?
{18825}{18884}Hold on.
{18920}{18967}You look beautif--
{18992}{19047}Oh, hi.
{19048}{19096}Ooh, corsage.
{19097}{19135}Oh, I'm sorry.
{19136}{19207}Mark, Jimmy. Jimmy, Mark.
{19208}{19258}'Sup, Jimbo?
{19311}{19354}'Sup, Marko?
{19355}{19383}You ready?
{19384}{19416}Yeah. Just let me|use the bathroom.
{19417}{19466}All right.|Pinch it quick.
{19512}{19559}-She loves that one.|-Hmm.
{19592}{19656}-Cigarette?|-What?
{19827}{19884}So Chloe tells me|you're a musician.
{19908}{19968}Well, I rock,|if that's what you mean.
{19969}{19992}Ahh
{19993}{20019}You know?
{20020}{20067}So, what are you guys|gonna do tonight?
{20095}{20147}You know,|a little bit of this.
{20148}{20186}Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
{20187}{20265}Oh, yeah.|Oh, that's it, ahh.
{20266}{20310}Oh, oh!|That's it. Ohh!
{20311}{20346}Sounds like fun.
{20348}{20397}|All right. All ready.
{20398}{20463}That's how I do it on stage.
{20515}{20560}Did I tell you|how beautiful you look?
{20561}{20603}Come here.
{20604}{20674}I'm gonna be|the luckiest guy at the prom.
{20675}{20759}One thing was for sure.|Mark was cool.
{20760}{20792}Bye, Jimmy.
{20793}{20868}Who could compete|with a guy like that?
{20869}{20917}-Hands.|-I'm sorry.
{21010}{21044}Come on, Chloe.
{21045}{21081}We've been going out|for two years...
{21082}{21125}I want a little action.
{21126}{21153}Mark, I told you--
{21154}{21209}I want to wait|till I get married.
{21397}{21439}Hands.
{21737}{21800}I tried to warn you,|but you wouldn't listen.
{21801}{21863}All women|will leave you someday.
{21864}{21914}That girl didn't love you.
{21915}{21955}She just felt sorry for you.
{21956}{22012}You think she'd marry a boy|who couldn't even touch her?
{22114}{22176}Hey.
{22177}{22252}Hi.
{22253}{22291}Are you going somewhere?
{22292}{22391}Yeah. You know Mark?
{22392}{22509}We've sorta been going out|off and on for a while now...
{22510}{22561}and, um...
{22562}{22680}Well, he kind of asked me to...
{22681}{22724}-To go fishing?|-No!
{22725}{22781}-To go to the movies?|-No!
{22782}{22879}-To get married?|-Yes!
{22937}{22992}The wedding's this Saturday|in Niagara Falls.
{23025}{23097}I didn't know how to tell you,|Jimmy, because...
{23150}{23227}The thing is, um...
{23228}{23273}I really wanted to know...
{23274}{23321}if you think|he's the right one...
{23321}{23407}because it's such a big step,|you know? And...
{23437}{23469}Jimmy?
{23533}{23617}I made you something.
{23843}{23912}Take Bubble Guinea Pig.|I don't want him anymore.
{24131}{24171}So that's it?
{24172}{24228}That's all|you're going to say?
{24260}{24292}Bye, Jimmy.
{24384}{24432}Good-bye.
{24498}{24570}Can you still remember
{24570}{24633}How it seemed
{24634}{24692}That we could live forever
{24693}{24770}In a lovers' dream?
{24771}{24835}The falling|was the best part
{24836}{24901}But now you know
{24902}{24941}The things you cling to
{24942}{25022}Your heart can start to grow
{25023}{25116}You, you're walking away
{25117}{25154}I've been there
{25155}{25253}Now I know what to say
{25254}{25394}I'm the king of yesterday
{25395}{25499}Why don't,|why don't you stay
{25500}{25537}Chloe!
{25538}{25630}God...bless America!
{25631}{25694}That nasty little slut...
{25695}{25754}Left just in|the nick of time, Morton.
{25995}{26069}I had no idea|what I was up against.
{26070}{26118}Chloe hadn't told me much.
{26118}{26176}All I knew was that|she was in New York...
{26177}{26246}which may as well been on|the other side of the galaxy...
{26247}{26325}and I only had|three days to get there.
{26326}{26369}Three days.
{26370}{26434}I just needed the bubble suit|to last that long.
{26528}{26642}Flying high now
{26643}{26745}I'm so high now
{26915}{26949}Ooh!
{27046}{27143}Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!
{27363}{27483}Getting strong now
{27484}{27610}Moving on now
{27695}{27738}Uhh!
{27739}{27767}Aah!

{28078}{28118}Street lamp.
{28119}{28153}Oh.

{30510}{30568}Plus I gotta charge you|for an additional seat...
{30569}{30656}for that...stupid thing|you're wearing.
{30657}{30759}Oh, money. Oh. Money.
{30847}{30890}How far will this get me?
{30891}{30948}Take a step back.
{31024}{31090}That far.
{31221}{31251}Um...
{31252}{31295}the girl I love|is getting married...
{31296}{31353}and I have|to stop the wedding.

{31621}{31684}Next in line, please.
{31965}{32012}OK. Have a nice day.
{32517}{32595}The white zone's|for loading and unloading only.

{34654}{34713}Jimmy! Breakfie!
{34842}{34956}Jimmy!
{35121}{35153}The Kloobda.
{35206}{35265}The Kloobda is|the holy guide to living pure...
{35266}{35348}dictated to Gil|by a talking salamander.
{35350}{35382}But more on that later.
{35383}{35429}This will help explain.
{35430}{35489}Put it|in the decontamination bay.
{35490}{35537}Right there.
{35569}{35616}First,|we prepare our souls...
{35618}{35689}by stripping ourselves|of all material possessions...
{35690}{35753}and sexual desires.
{35823}{35853}Ha ha ha ha!
{35891}{35950}-Kool-aid, Lorraine?|-Thanks, Lorraine.
{35951}{35992}-Lorraine?|-Ooh!
{35993}{36032}Her name's Lorraine, too?
{36033}{36068}We're all Lorraine.
{36070}{36106}And you will be Todd...
{36107}{36200}a name chosen|especially for you by Gil.
{36201}{36269}What does Bill|do with all your stuff?
{36270}{36325}He's holding it for us|at the compound.
{36326}{36363}Where's the compound?
{36364}{36429}I'm not really sure.
{36430}{36469}In Texas?
{36470}{36523}Oh. You're not|a singing group...
{36524}{36595}you're a cult!|Ha ha ha!
{36635}{36666}Why'd we stop?
{36667}{36761}This isn't Niagara Falls!|This is a desert!
{36763}{36845}Yes--yes, I realize|that in typical cases...
{36847}{36872}you have to wait 48 hours.
{36873}{36932}But this is not a typical case.
{36933}{37010}My son is a bubble boy.|He'll die out there!
{37046}{37112}Well, you'll certainly be|in my prayers tonight.
{37113}{37170}And I'll be praying|you get nut cancer!
{37203}{37285}All right, Plan B.|Did you finish the note?
{37286}{37345}Come on.
{37347}{37417}"Mr. and Mrs. Livingston,|we have kidnapped your son.
{37418}{37528}"Pay $1 00,000 or he dies.|Signed, the Jews."
{37529}{37606}Are you kidding?|Are you kidding me?
{37607}{37692}Who in their right mind|is gonna believe this note?
{37693}{37748}It's the Jews, Morton!
{37749}{37827}They're gonna want|more than $1 00,000!
{37828}{37894}Think, man, think!

{39108}{39226}I think he's deaf.|Have you seen my boy?
{39228}{39322}Your weird-ass son|got on a bus...
{39323}{39441}full of happy people skipping|around all over the place...
{39442}{39478}and they headed towards Vegas.
{39479}{39518}You know, Satan's anus.
{39519}{39547}Thank you.
{39548}{39623}You filthy, fat,|filthy deaf man!
{39624}{39688}I heard that.
{39689}{39723}Mort, let's move it!
{39776}{39848}I'll have you know|that I've lost two pounds.
{39849}{39897}I have my ankle weights|on right now...
{39898}{39957}and it's very hot in here|and I'm losing weight.
{39958}{40017}I've lost four pounds|in the last two months.

{40564}{40598}some kind of astronaut?
{40599}{40686}No, I'm some kind|of bubble boy.
{40687}{40763}How do you take a dump|in that thing?
{40764}{40879}I think I could help you|with your situation here.
{40880}{40930}How's some bubble vato|gonna help me?
{40931}{40999}I got patches.
{41000}{41049}Patches?
{41050}{41106}I could use|some stinkin' patches.
{41160}{41247}-Gil!|-Gil, we love you!
{41248}{41331}Welcome, my children.|Welcome.
{41333}{41452}Today will truly be a time|of spiritual illumination.
{41500}{41547}Now, can anyone guess|why we're all here?
{41549}{41572}-Ooh!|-Ooh, me!
{41573}{41637}Yes, Todd.|No, the other Todd.
{41638}{41706}To find out the final|incarnation of the Chosen One?
{41707}{41753}Exactly.
{41754}{41815}I can see you've been|reading your Kloobda.
{41816}{41875}The Chosen One is among us!
{41906}{41960}He walks the earth.
{41961}{42064}His final incarnation|will be...
{42125}{42167}A round one!
{42277}{42339}Yes, the round one.
{42340}{42419}The holy messenger|trapped in a living globe.
{42420}{42484}We must find him|and release him...
{42485}{42540}so that he may carry us...
{42541}{42623}only true believers,|to the kingdom of Heaven.
{42624}{42712}And those who reject him|will mutate...
{42713}{42800}and burn eternally|on Planet PX-41 .
{42825}{42905}Or PX-42,|if they run out of room.
{42906}{42963}If there are|no further questions...
{42964}{42999}Let's move on to the buffet.
{43085}{43124}So they kicked you|out of the bus...
{43125}{43187}in the middle of the desert|to die like some perro?
{43188}{43225}Yep.
{43226}{43252}Where you headed?
{43253}{43332}Niagara Falls. I gotta|get there by Saturday...
{43333}{43403}to stop Chloe from marrying|the wrong man.
{43404}{43473}Ha ha ha!|Let's cut the vato, ese!
{43474}{43545}I wasn't planning on|cutting the vato, no.
{43546}{43587}Somebody run off|with your old lady...
{43588}{43646}Legally|you're allowed to cut him.
{43647}{43695}She wasn't|technically my old lady.
{43696}{43769}I just never...
{43770}{43837}I just never told her|how I felt.
{43838}{43974}When I was your age,|I was in love with a woman.
{43975}{44025}-Debbie?|-No.
{44026}{44114}-Danielle.|-No. Wildfire!
{44115}{44225}Oh, Wildfire!|She looks really nice.
{44226}{44258}Yeah, but she left me|for some other vato.
{44259}{44309}You know,|real buttoned-down...
{44310}{44373}"I gotta get a job"|kind of vato, you know?
{44374}{44432}To this day, ese,|I regret not finding him...
{44433}{44508}and cutting his heart out|in a really violent way.
{44558}{44650}Don't be like me, ese.|Don't live in regret.
{44651}{44786}We'll be riding wildfire
{44787}{44824}We'll be riding
{44825}{44854}Ohh!
{44855}{44955}Wildfire

{45662}{45693}That's "slots"!
{45694}{45750}I'll show you how to play|the slot machines.
{45751}{45825}We can win some gas money|to get to Niagara Falls!

{46735}{46771}My baby Jimmy?
{46772}{46814}Here we go. Oh, yeah.
{46815}{46875}Coming through.|Excuse us.
{46876}{46926}Come on,|talk to me, babies.
{46927}{46975}Lookin' good!|Yes, all right.
{47047}{47094}-Slim?|-Yeah.
{47095}{47141}What's it like?
{47267}{47326}Ha ha ha ha ha!
{47327}{47395}I could tell you what it was|like with me and Wildfire.
{47396}{47505}1,200 CCs of American steel|vibrating between your legs.
{47506}{47573}Oh, man.|I'm talking fourth gear.
{47574}{47677}4,000 RPMs! Ay!|Ha ha ha ha!
{47678}{47733}That sounds amazing!|Ha ha!
{47734}{47805}-Hors d'oeuvres?|-Oh, no, thanks.
{47807}{47850}I got my own.
{47876}{47950}OK. Last one.
{47951}{47998}You go for it!
{47999}{48024}Oh, no. I couldn't.
{48025}{48058}Go on.
{48059}{48113}You want to win the money|for our trip, don't you?
{48114}{48166}But what if I lose again?
{48167}{48235}You didn't get out of that|bubble room to play it safe.
{48236}{48286}You're right.
{48287}{48322}Go for it.
{48440}{48490}Oh! I'm tapped out.
{48491}{48570}I'm gonna steal some quarters|from that blind lady.
{48571}{48611}Slim, I don't think--
{48612}{48650}I gotta go.|I only have two days--
{48699}{48769}No, Slim! I gotta go!|I only have two days left!
{48770}{48827}-It'll be awesome!|-I only have two days left!
{48828}{48870}Bow-wow|ba-ba-ba bow-wow

{49032}{49097}Rrrow-wow|ba-ba-ba bow-wow
{49098}{49158}I didn't like leaving Slim|without saying good-bye...
{49160}{49205}but I knew the vato|would understand.
{49206}{49247}The wedding|was two days away...
{49248}{49362}and I only had 12 CCs of|American steel to get me there.
{49363}{49451}Don't think I can't see you|gawking at those neon boobies.
{49452}{49535}Just keep your eye|on the road, mister.
{49620}{49668}Hey, have you seen|my little buddy?
{49668}{49773}He's got frizzy hair,|and he's in a bubble.
{49774}{49815}Hey, what's up?
{49816}{49852}Uhh!
{49853}{49920}Have you seen|this little bubble guy, ma'am?
{49969}{50023}I didn't mean it.
{50024}{50122}Excuse. Hola.
{50123}{50154}We're a bit lost.
{50155}{50203}Could you tell us the way to--
{50204}{50240}Niagara Falls?
{50240}{50288}I beg your pardon?
{50289}{50326}'Cause that's where|my little buddy was headed...
{50328}{50380}when you left him|in the desert to die!
{50444}{50488}Come back!
{50489}{50519}You Bright and Shinies--
{50520}{50566}come back and get shiny|on my knife!
{50615}{50643}Hey! Hey! Hey!
{50760}{50825}Aah!
{50856}{50919}This looks like Area 51 .
{50920}{50966}|Holy mother of shit, Morton!
{50967}{51024}What is that?|A space creature? An alien?
{51089}{51126}Oh, my God! Jimmy!
{51127}{51167}Bow-wow|ba-ba-ba bow-wow
{51168}{51192}Ba-ba-ba-ba
{51192}{51216}Jimmy!
{51216}{51248}Stop the car!
{51249}{51279}Jimmy!
{51386}{51435}Aah!
{51436}{51476}Aah!
{51477}{51547}Uhh! Aah!
{51789}{51866}I wasn't quite sure|just how I'd gotten on board...
{51867}{51932}but I'd always dreamed|of riding a train.
{51933}{52000}Thank goodness|the worst was behind me...
{52001}{52056}or so I thought.
{52089}{52137}RUBBER WO|Look, he's awake.
{52289}{52324}What are we going to do?
{52386}{52415}Aah!
{52416}{52487}-Aah!|-Aah!
{52489}{52539}Shh!
{52540}{52582}Dr. Phreak is gonna hear you!
{52583}{52659}-What?|-He'll hear you. Hide!
{52660}{52718}What did you say?
{52719}{52815}He said be quiet or|the doctor will hear you. Shh!
{52817}{52856}Who are you?
{52857}{52913}They call me|the Human Sasquatch.
{52914}{52955}What's your real name?
{52956}{53048}Um...Clark?
{53049}{53087}So what's your deal?
{53088}{53147}Why are you in a bubble?
{53148}{53183}To protect me from germs.
{53184}{53240}I was born|without any immunities...
{53241}{53280}so even a single one|could kill me.
{53281}{53332}But your doctor|would know all about that.
{53333}{53371}Be quiet!|He's gonna come!
{53372}{53419}He's not your average doctor.
{53421}{53449}He's Dr. Phreak.
{53450}{53528}We're all part of|his traveling Phreak Show.
{53529}{53560}He owns us.
{53561}{53605}-Owns you?!|-Shh!
{53606}{53631}Be quiet!|Here comes Dr. Phreak!
{53632}{53661}He's an ex-con.
{53662}{53739}If he finds you in this train,|he'll own you, too.
{53788}{53842}Now you did it, bubble butt.
{53843}{53889}Here he comes!|Run for your life!
{53890}{53940}He's a vicious brute.
{54191}{54273}You're Dr. Phreak?
{54298}{54341}Ha ha ha ha!
{54342}{54380}You're so mini! Ha ha ha!
{54381}{54417}-Mini? Oh, no!|-No!
{54418}{54504}Me, mini?! I'm not mini!
{54505}{54609}I'm not mini!|Not! Not! Not!
{54610}{54657}I'm not mini!
{54658}{54701}Who the hell are you?
{54702}{54726}He's the bubble boy.
{54726}{54768}Shut your beak!
{54769}{54797}What are you doing|out of your coop?
{54798}{54829}I shut up.
{54830}{54909}I could use|some fresh meat in my show.
{54910}{54969}Why don't you hop|your little bubble butt...
{54970}{55005}back on that train?
{55006}{55061}Thanks, but, um...
{55062}{55128}I gotta get to|Niagara Falls by Saturday...
{55129}{55162}to stop Chloe|from getting married.
{55214}{55282}That's so, so beautiful.
{55283}{55326}I, too, once loved another.
{55327}{55380}-You did?|-For 1 0 minutes.
{55381}{55421}Then I kicked her ass|out of the car.
{55422}{55487}Well, I gotta get going.
{55488}{55511}Going?!
{55512}{55539}-Oh!|-Oh!
{55540}{55564}|What are you gonna do?
{55566}{55620}You're a freak,|and I should know.
{55621}{55652}That's my business.
{55653}{55721}No decent girl wants|to marry a bubble freak.
{55722}{55793}Once you get that through|your thick, freaky skull...
{55794}{55845}then give me a call.
{55846}{55897}What's wrong with being a freak?
{55898}{55927}Aah!
{55955}{56038}-Oh!|-Oh! That hurt!
{56039}{56072}Doctor?
{56073}{56128}Is he OK?|I didn't mean to...
{56129}{56180}He looks so sweet|when he's not yelling.
{56181}{56242}You've killed him.
{56278}{56333}-What are we going to do?|-Whoa!
{56334}{56398}Good luck! Bye!
{56399}{56470}Uhh! Heads up, Bubble!
{56471}{56499}OK. Bye!

{56790}{56845}We're going with you,|Dr. Bubble.
{56846}{56873}We're going with you.
{56874}{56910}Dr. Bubble? No, no!
{56911}{56970}You guys are free.
{56971}{57012}You can do whatever|you want now.
{57013}{57061}|Oh, we're free!
{57062}{57089}Free as a bird!

{57159}{57198}On to Niagara Falls!
{57199}{57239}All the way!|Oh, I love it!
{57240}{57273}Look, you guys...
{57274}{57344}I gotta do this alone.
{57407}{57438}Oh, yeah.
{57439}{57478}Bye!
{57659}{57703}It sure was nice...

{62921}{62948}You're welcome.
{62949}{63000}Those were some crazy vatos.
{63001}{63047}For some unknown reason,|Shiva has brought you...
{63048}{63088}into my life|like a hot flash.
{63089}{63136}You came to my defense...
{63137}{63201}and the law of karma|requires me to return the favor.
{63202}{63260}This ice cream truck|is merely a catalyst...
{63261}{63312}a way to teach|the wisdom of the Sacred Cow.
{63313}{63350}For who can resist|ice cream, eh?
{63351}{63375}I know I can't.
{63376}{63435}So, how may I be|of service to you...

{63469}{63519}I need to get to|Niagara Falls by Saturday...
{63520}{63568}to stop Chloe|from getting married.
{63569}{63656}Oh. I was thinking...
{63657}{63705}more along the lines|of a free snow cone...
{63705}{63789}but, OK,|Niagara Falls it is.
{63837}{63974}Livin' in|the Land of the Lost
{63975}{64022}Livin' in the Land...
{64051}{64133}No way is this better|than "Jurassic Park."
{64134}{64198}I can't believe you and|bubble geek like this show.
{64199}{64226}The effects look totally fake.
{64227}{64268}That's the whole point.
{64269}{64312}What?|It's supposed to look fake?
{64349}{64408}I'm not here.
{64448}{64476}Hello?

{64618}{64659}|How could he be here?
{64660}{64688}Well, apparently|he's on his way...
{64689}{64730}to your wedding|in a bubble suit...
{64731}{64821}exposing himself to|all the wickedness and filth...

{65234}{65328}Don't you take that tone|of voice with me, young man!
{65329}{65421}Morton, are you gonna let him|talk to me like that?
{65422}{65474}Yeah, Mort. Are ya?
{65614}{65672}-My car!|-My freaks!
{65841}{65941}Help! Jimmy!|Aah! Jimmy!

{66758}{66834}Oh! Oh!
{66835}{66929}Look at that.|It's an elk.
{66957}{67029}Or is it a caribou?
{67031}{67100}Or an American bison?
{67157}{67194}l, uh...
{67195}{67244}I think that it's a cow.
{67245}{67316}Oh, really?! A cow?!
{67317}{67387}I didn't know.
{67388}{67434}What have I done?
{67435}{67491}It's just a cow, Pushpop.
{67555}{67590}Just a cow?
{67591}{67637}Just a cow?!
{67638}{67689}In my religion,|the cow is the womb...
{67690}{67736}from which all life springs!
{67737}{67764}Heh heh heh!
{67765}{67826}I have transgressed|against Shiva!
{67909}{67942}Shiva?
{67969}{68017}|The six-armed goddess.
{68018}{68062}Have you ever been|karmically bitch-slapped...
{68063}{68101}by a six-armed goddess?
{68127}{68195}I'll take that as a no!
{68196}{68235}Oh! Um...
{68236}{68293}It's OK, Pushpop.
{68294}{68347}Your religion's all lies.
{68348}{68401}Pardon?
{68402}{68453}That's what my mom says.
{68454}{68496}I mean...
{68497}{68545}Bollocks.
{68547}{68597}I must atone.
{68598}{68642}|His mother taught him.
{68643}{68679}What nonsense.
{68680}{68728}May Shiva|shine upon your journey!
{68729}{68792}Well, can't we...
{68793}{68866}can't we drive and atone?
{68867}{68904}No! One for the road.
{68905}{68963}What? No, no, no.
{68964}{69019}There are germs in here!

{69163}{69199}When did this happen?
{69302}{69359}Thanks for the lift!|So long!

{84506}{84554}Chasing a dame, ain't you?
{84555}{84617}Who am I to judge you
{84618}{84703}Last time I was|in a commotion like that...
{84704}{84772}it was all on account|of Poon .
{84773}{84815}Oh, what the astronauts drink.
{84816}{84864}No, no. My wife.
{84866}{84949}My little China doll.
{84950}{84996}Yeah, till that damn|brother of mine...
{84997}{85066}took her off to Waxahachie.
{85067}{85145}Snatched my Poon|right out from under me.
{85146}{85221}86 years ago.
{85222}{85286}I ain't spoke|to that bastard since.
{85287}{85368}Don't live in regret, ese.
{85369}{85425}He's your family.
{85426}{85473}Family. Heh.
{85474}{85540}I really gotta go!
{85541}{85617}I told you, once we're on|the road we're not stopping!
{85618}{85739}Than mislead you with a lie
{85740}{85794}And after all that...
{85795}{85869}they still didn't get you|a new puppy?
{85870}{85893}No.
{85894}{85977}Ohh.|Poor little thing.
{85978}{86089}No wonder you turned out|the way you did.
{86090}{86128}Ohh.
{86130}{86251}And sometimes when we touch
{86252}{86345}The honesty's too much
{86635}{86689}Morning, Pappy.
{86735}{86790}You must be tired.
{86791}{86931}You get any sleep?|Ha ha ha!
{86932}{87007}I said, you get any sleep?
{87008}{87096}Pappy!

{87527}{87619}Pappy? Pappy! Stop!
{87620}{87734}Aah!
{87735}{87839}Oh! Ow!
{87840}{87883}Yow! Yeah, I'm fine.
{87979}{88007}You have a phone?
{88329}{88372}Yello.
{88583}{88626}Hello?
{88627}{88685}Hi. Is Chloe there?
{88686}{88736}|Who can I say is calling?
{88737}{88767}It's Jimmy.
{88768}{88853}Oh. Hello, Jimmy.
{88856}{88897}Where the hell are you?
{88898}{88984}I'm really close.|In New York, I think.
{88985}{89059}I don't mean to burst|your bubble, Jimbo...
{89060}{89134}but if you got a thing for|Chloe, it's not gonna happen.
{89136}{89183}We're getting married|in one hour.
{89184}{89226}What are you|expecting to happen?
{89227}{89260}You can't even touch her.
{89261}{89288}How are you|gonna have children?
{89289}{89339}Do you even have sperm?
{89372}{89431}Fact it, dude,|you're a charity case.
{89432}{89514}Chloe felt sorry for you|because you lived in a bubble.
{89516}{89555}Do us all a favor.
{89556}{89597}Go on back to Palmdale|where you belong.
{89838}{89934}I wasn't quite sure what|Mark meant about the sperm...
{89936}{90004}but he was right|about one thing.
{90005}{90052}Even if l did get there...
{90053}{90115}I couldn't ever really|hold Chloe in my arms...
{90116}{90175}or kiss her for real.
{90221}{90279}I really was a freak.
{90415}{90447}Hello.
{90448}{90511}Hi, Dr. Phreak.|It's Jimmy.
{90512}{90554}Jimmy who?
{90555}{90585}The bubble boy.
{90586}{90632}Jimmy?! Give me that!
{90633}{90660}That's my phone!
{90661}{90709}Hello? Jimmy?
{90710}{90753}-Mom?|-Jimmy!
{90754}{90795}What are you doing|with Dr. Phreak?
{90795}{90847}-Where are you?|-Where are my freaks?
{90848}{90915}OK, sweetheart,|we'll be right there.
{90915}{90944}Don't move!
{90945}{91013}Morton, we've got our boy back!
{91014}{91058}Gimme that.
{91221}{91302}Aah! Ow! Ooh!
{91303}{91423}Ow! Eek! Ohh!|Son of a bitch.
{91425}{91456}Mama.
{91969}{92044}Ohh! Aah!
{92312}{92367}I never stole anything before...
{92368}{92406}and I just fell off|a dead man's car...
{92407}{92436}and my parents are about|to come pick me up...
{92437}{92478}and this is the girl|I love's favorite beer...
{92479}{92539}and I was just wondering,|could I borrow it?
{92541}{92594}Yeah, sure.
{92595}{92628}Thanks.
{92744}{92786}Now open the safe!
{92787}{92831}Do it! Chop chop!
{93169}{93210}Ohh...
{93253}{93281}Aah!
{93281}{93307}My baby!
{93308}{93409}The sweet Lord|has delivered you from evil.
{93410}{93448}Ohh!
{93449}{93510}I must say, you put us|through heck, young man!
{93511}{93578}But I think you learned|a valuable lesson.
{93579}{93641}There's no place like home.
{93695}{93736}Morton, load him in the car.
{93737}{93800}The Spirit's burning|so strong in my bosom...
{93800}{93871}I think I have to wee-wee.
{94408}{94479}How--ahem--|how was it out here?
{94480}{94528}Was it fun?
{94833}{94888}You can see the moon today.
{94918}{94969}You know, it kind of|makes you wonder...
{94970}{95020}what would have happened|if Neil Armstrong...
{95021}{95091}had gone all the way|to the moon...
{95092}{95179}and then never|stepped on the surface.
{95582}{95620}Jimmy!
{95621}{95665}Morton, where's Jimmy?!
{95666}{95697}What happened?
{95794}{95849}Jimmy! Jimmy!
