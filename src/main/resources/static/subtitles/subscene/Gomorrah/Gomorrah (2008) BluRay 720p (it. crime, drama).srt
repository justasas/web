4
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,110
How long you gonna be?

5
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,037
Be right out,

6
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:56,249
you're a pain!

7
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:24,316
Hey, American.

8
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:27,069
I'm still here, gettin' a manicure.

9
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:31,115
Things okay?

10
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:34,493
Gettin' tanned? Don't get burned!

11
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:36,245
Bruno's here too.

12
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,204
You got a crap body!

13
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,958
Is Bruno here?

14
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,710
He's over there.

15
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,635
You doin' a lamp?

16
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:04,243
It's 2,000.

17
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,621
How much are you
supposed to get this week?

18
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:08,581
9,200.

19
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,875
Sure? It was less last week.

20
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:15,755
Yes, Don Ciro, 9,200.

21
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,674
Another 2,000 euro and we're even.

22
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:22,636
Don Ciro, don't take all day.

23
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:24,304
He's slow.

24
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:28,058
Hurry, so we can go home.

25
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,478
Things okay out there?

26
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:34,063
Keep your eyes open.

27
00:05:44,616 --> 00:05:45,741
That's it.

28
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:52,914
Put paper cups in.

29
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,088
Toilet paper.

30
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,346
- Then, Mom?
- Some shampoo.

31
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:13,058
A mozzarella...

32
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:20,858
Shampoo, not bath oil!

33
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,567
You're rushin' me!

34
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:25,445
And you're drivin' me crazy!

35
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:33,202
Hurry up, there are
more groceries to deliver.

36
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:35,705
- Nothing else?
- No.

37
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,378
- Be back later.
- Don't get yourself lost.

38
00:06:55,307 --> 00:06:57,516
- Simone.
- Totò, what's up?

39
00:06:57,642 --> 00:07:00,060
- What's happening?
- I'm workin'.

40
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,441
Know what happened?
They arrested Vitale and Bon Bon.

41
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:06,984
Really?

42
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,487
- Got somethin' to eat?
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

43
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:13,490
Bye, see you.

44
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:31,173
Carmela, ma'am!

45
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,139
Hi, Boxer.

46
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,458
Two doses, two doses!

47
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,961
Please, give me a dose!

48
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:18,926
Gaetano, check it!

49
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:57,504
One, two, three...

50
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:02,134
Goodbye.

51
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:05,928
Don Ciro, be more punctual.

52
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:07,263
I'll pass it on.

53
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,898
Eleven and twelve.

54
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,067
See if he wants coffee.

55
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,569
No, but thank you anyway...

56
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:24,404
I'll show you out.

57
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,449
Have a good day.

58
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,374
Four hundred...

59
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:42,838
Five hundred.

60
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:46,383
The same amount again?

61
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:50,471
I've said a hundred times
I can't manage like this.

62
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,056
Don Carlo...

63
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:59,395
Did you tell them I can't manage
on this chickenfeed?

64
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:02,315
I have to pay rent, lights, water.

65
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:06,152
I can't survive,
I'm strapped with debts.

66
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:09,656
- I'll pass it on.
- You always say that!

67
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:13,200
Are you mockin' me?

68
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:15,160
I don't get it!

69
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:17,537
Listen,

70
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,498
I've got a son to support,

71
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:23,919
for forty years
I've kept him off the streets,

72
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:26,462
he's unemployed.

73
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,174
What can I do,
go over to the other side?

74
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:34,845
They know, I served you honestly
for forty years.

75
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:38,265
My wife's in jail,
is this the thanks we get?

76
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,851
Are we crazy?
Do I have to raise hell?

77
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:46,648
Silvana!

78
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,324
May I?

79
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:00,369
Come on in!

80
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:01,620
Maria!

81
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,499
The bill?

82
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,625
Talk to Mom.

83
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,967
Put this in your pocket.

84
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,428
Thank you.

85
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,276
Carabinieri on the street!

86
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,456
He's comin' out!

87
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,057
I'm the best, number one!

88
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,435
So?

89
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:11,561
Go, Marco!

90
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:15,190
- I'll blast these roaches!
- Who do you think you're fighting?

91
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:19,944
I'm number one! Tony Montana!

92
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,571
The world is ours!

93
00:12:22,697 --> 00:12:24,948
You don't know
who you're up against!

94
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,034
I'm Tony Montana!

95
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:30,329
- I'm the powerhouse!
- Yeah!

96
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,830
Come here.

97
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:35,000
Shit Colombians,

98
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:36,877
they're everywhere.

99
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:41,088
See, Colombians everywhere.

100
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,594
You really looked like Scarface.

101
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,022
You were good.

102
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:02,943
Now it all has to be ours,
the whole world.

103
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:04,778
Miami, all of it.

104
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:22,586
My friend, got stuff?

105
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:33,012
You got stuff?

106
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:40,854
- Got good stuff?
- You got money?

107
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:45,274
- Sure, you got coke?
- What do you want to pay?

108
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,317
Me? 50.

109
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:54,241
- 55, can you do it?
- No, 55 is too much, 50.

110
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:56,618
You sure?

111
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,537
Wait here for me.

112
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:09,255
Where's Smarty?

113
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,941
Hey, kid!

114
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:44,288
Give him the money.

115
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,712
- Is it all here?
- Yeah.

116
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,480
- Okay?
- Yes.

117
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:17,569
- Want to see it?
- I want to try it.

118
00:15:20,114 --> 00:15:21,739
I gave you the money!

119
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:23,282
Wait!

120
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:30,665
Open your hand.

121
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:35,836
It's good.

122
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:40,715
Give me all of it!

123
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:50,725
Grab the money!

124
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,251
Giovanni, I brought the kids.

125
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:04,961
Come in.

126
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:11,468
You know very well why you're here.

127
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:15,471
Too much ruckus going on in my area,
because I'm the boss here.

128
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:18,515
That's just you sayin'.

129
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,769
If I had you come here, I know.
No back-talk

130
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,980
or I'll smash your face!

131
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:28,859
- What happened?
- For the moment, nothing.

132
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:31,195
Get me?

133
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:35,364
I can't be made to look bad
because of two kids like you.

134
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:39,869
The next time
I hear anything about you,

135
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:41,829
I'll blow your heads off.

136
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:44,999
- If it's like you say...
- Shut up when I'm talkin'.

137
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,460
Then if I come to realize

138
00:17:48,586 --> 00:17:51,046
you're worth something,

139
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:54,049
which I'll determine and I'll decide,

140
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,634
you can work for me.

141
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,135
Is that clear?

142
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:01,473
Show them out.

143
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,106
"I'll smash your face!"

144
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:12,024
And I'll tear your beard!

145
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,735
Without a T-shirt.

146
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:18,322
"Sweet Pea", looked like a bum.

147
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,282
A real bum.

148
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:23,118
He is a bum! Did you see
who he sent to get us?

149
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:26,663
If that guy's the boss here,

150
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,749
then here we can be the bosses.

151
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:35,421
If a guy like him is boss here,
this area is ours!

152
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,549
I'll live for 30 years
if he's boss here.

153
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,884
Sure, because he's a retard!

154
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,806
Get it? I'll live for 30 years.

155
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:48,600
But he could at least shave!

156
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:51,103
Shave!

157
00:18:51,312 --> 00:18:52,813
"I'll smash your face!"

158
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,816
Let's go have a snort to spite him.

159
00:18:57,276 --> 00:19:00,111
We've got everything,
we can do like we want.

160
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,242
Anyway, he's a fat shit-ass.

161
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,494
He bugged you?

162
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:10,662
He showers once a week!

163
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:17,586
"I'll blow your heads off!"

164
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:43,568
Roberto!

165
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,955
Let's go, it's too small.

166
00:19:56,081 --> 00:20:00,417
- But the methane one's big.
- No, it's small.

167
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:04,546
- Can I finish measuring?
- No, we're wasting time.

168
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:11,345
- I have to take some shots.
- What a bore with these pictures!

169
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:12,679
Let's go!

170
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,519
Just look at this.

171
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:23,814
It's disgusting down there.

172
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,199
Here is perfect.

173
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:36,785
It's perfect.

174
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:40,830
We're near the highway,
the trucks can get really close,

175
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:44,167
they dump the earth
and cover all the water.

176
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:46,336
Perfect.

177
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,256
Franco, it's 85 meters.

178
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:51,966
Get the length too.

179
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,513
Come here.

180
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,183
Dante...

181
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:04,269
Hello, everything okay?

182
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:07,397
This is Roberto.

183
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:14,028
- It's time we made room for youth.
- We need new energy.

184
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:15,863
Take a few more shots.

185
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:19,867
Did you hear?

186
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:21,868
They bombed me,

187
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:23,912
at the cement plant.

188
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:28,000
A whole wall came down,

189
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:29,584
slowly.

190
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:31,545
Be careful.

191
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:33,588
Zio resolved it.

192
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,426
I'd forgotten to pay
for some land I'd bought.

193
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:40,761
- An injunction against payment?
- Yeah!

194
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:43,597
- What do you think?
- It's fine.

195
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:46,559
- Can we fill this quarry?
- Sure can.

196
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:49,603
Tell Zio it's fine.

197
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:55,734
Remember, everything clean:
Terracing, solid stuff...

198
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:58,862
Or the redevelopment agency
will break our balls.

199
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:04,659
Don't worry,
you emptied it and I'll fill it.

200
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:17,171
All the pieces have to be cut
and the sizes worked out.

201
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:20,716
They want 120 of these.

202
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,229
Six and seven are identical.

203
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,486
Here the satin is cut on the bias.

204
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,403
It's all hand-hemmed.

205
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:44,654
Is it tough?

206
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,867
The models aren't hard,
I can do it.

207
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,789
Eight hundred items in two months,
is our request.

208
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:58,293
Keep in mind
we start at 50 euros per item.

209
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,088
You've seen the models,
the price is good,

210
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,549
estimate and make your offèrs.

211
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,928
Thirty euro, 30 days?

212
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,138
Don't go any lower.

213
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,141
This is high fashion,
it's not prèt-à-porter.

214
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,684
Forty-five, in two months.

215
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,397
- Ms. Zamarion!
- Yes?

216
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:22,399
Thirty-eight, forty.

217
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:25,151
That's a very interesting proposal.

218
00:23:25,528 --> 00:23:27,529
Thirty-five, thirty-five,

219
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:31,156
excellent workmanship
and delivery times respected.

220
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:33,367
Thirty, thirty!

221
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,335
Please,

222
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:46,046
we're not imposing anything!

223
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:50,007
Did we say thirty, thirty?

224
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:52,009
At this point

225
00:23:52,594 --> 00:23:54,429
twenty-eight, thirty!

226
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:01,144
Thirty, twenty-five!

227
00:24:04,188 --> 00:24:05,730
I can't lose this bid.

228
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:08,608
Come here, there's some bubbly!

229
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:12,571
Are they coming?

230
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:15,323
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

231
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:21,120
Five days less for delivery,

232
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:24,039
we'll have to work overtime,
and I'll do nights...

233
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,791
What's odd about that?

234
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,294
They're talking overtime pay.

235
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,546
They'll get it!

236
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:34,258
Am I scared of a little overtime?

237
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:37,510
Like the last time?

238
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:40,013
Don't worry,
this time it's a sure thing.

239
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:46,644
- They've lost their trust.
- I know.

240
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:51,065
- I asked you to talk to them.
- You do it, please.

241
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:54,651
You're on closer terms,
they respect you.

242
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:56,278
Do me this favor.

243
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:00,616
Don't say no, go talk to them.

244
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,285
You know I'm fond of you,

245
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:05,078
I'll have to make
a gold statue to you!

246
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:07,789
I'll go down and see the accountant
for the money.

247
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:16,589
Sorry, how much is this?

248
00:25:17,424 --> 00:25:18,633
Ten thousand.

249
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:23,387
It's not enough, I need more.

250
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:25,431
Twice that at least.

251
00:25:25,723 --> 00:25:28,517
Mr. Enzo,
you're already "complicated".

252
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:31,770
Yes, but for personal affairs.
I need this for work.

253
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:35,982
I'll give it back in three months.

254
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:37,859
But this isn't enough.

255
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:41,862
If you don't need it
and it's not enough,

256
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:43,322
I'll take it back.

257
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:45,282
It's best for you.

258
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,577
Don't be like that, listen,

259
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:51,205
I need at least double!

260
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:52,790
It's no risk,

261
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,625
you'll earn from it, right?

262
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:56,168
What can I say?

263
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,087
I'll pass it on,
can you make-do for now?

264
00:25:59,213 --> 00:26:01,756
Yes, I'll take it.

265
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:14,977
Congratulations, Mr. Pasquale.

266
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:16,311
Thank you.

267
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:18,814
We met yesterday.

268
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:23,569
I need your help.

269
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:32,994
I'm having trouble with work.

270
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:38,624
I have to get into
haute couture right away,

271
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:43,337
but for me it is very difficult.

272
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:46,966
I need help.

273
00:26:50,136 --> 00:26:51,386
You are

274
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:54,139
a great master,

275
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:57,183
you are very important for me.

276
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,604
You teach ten lessons

277
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:03,481
to workers in my factory.

278
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:07,693
I pay you in cash,

279
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:10,738
2,000 euros a lesson

280
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:13,365
for ten lessons.

281
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,620
We work together,
but no one knows it,

282
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:19,913
just the two of us.

283
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:23,458
I need your help.

284
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:26,794
Think it over.

285
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:34,093
- What's the cloth like?
- Come and see.

286
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,628
I've got nothin'!

287
00:28:13,464 --> 00:28:16,174
Don't move!

288
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:22,153
They must have gone over to his side,

289
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,364
or they'd have arrested me first
and then those other guys.

290
00:29:26,241 --> 00:29:28,743
Believe me? All of them were there
when I called you.

291
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,661
I said: "Check out this car,
it's suspect."

292
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:33,371
This stuff here is ours.

293
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,790
My gun!

294
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:41,296
Check this stuff out,
there should be fifty-six.

295
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:48,594
Good, Totò, this is for you.

296
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,389
How can I get working with you?

297
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,850
We'll let you know.

298
00:29:56,936 --> 00:29:59,271
- Did you turn off the water?
- Of course!

299
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:03,233
- Can I help out?
- No, you'll get wet.

300
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,442
Doesn't matter!

301
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:06,778
Come and see.

302
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,447
Careful not to slip.

303
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:15,495
- Is it coming from the well?
- No, I think it's from the pipe.

304
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:19,040
Careful, water's coming in.

305
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,583
See if you can close it.

306
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:25,128
It's closed,
but it's the pipe that...

307
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:33,303
I'd give you a hand, but...

308
00:30:34,806 --> 00:30:36,388
What a great day!

309
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:38,307
Push it all in one direction.

310
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:47,817
I thought I'd be having coffee!

311
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:51,570
- Nice coffee, huh?
- I'll have some next time.

312
00:30:59,745 --> 00:31:01,454
Totore, things okay?

313
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,501
- Can I say hi?
- No, you gotta leave.

314
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,961
Go down with these bags!

315
00:31:10,255 --> 00:31:12,714
You have to move!

316
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,467
Ma'am, go around the other way.

317
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:18,178
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine, leave.

318
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,908
Lucia?

319
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,564
Come closer.

320
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:17,775
- What's your name?
- Luigi.

321
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:22,196
- Are you scared?
- No.

322
00:32:22,364 --> 00:32:23,865
- Sure?
- No.

323
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:26,117
We'll see.

324
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:31,538
- Are you strong?
- Yeah!

325
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:33,624
Let's see how strong you are.

326
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,922
Why are you shaking?

327
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:42,799
No?

328
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:53,213
- See how strong this kid is.
- Come closer!

329
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:01,971
- Are you scared?
- Yes.

330
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:22,240
Now you're a man.

331
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,677
Nothin'! Everything's okay!

332
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:47,931
When I did my piercing,
I got an infection.

333
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:49,808
Let's see.

334
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,478
You went and did it there?

335
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,899
- I'd like to have it on my eyebrow.
- Stinks.

336
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,943
It's nicer there, you're right.

337
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:04,363
It's gonna rain.

338
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:07,658
Everything's okay!

339
00:36:10,662 --> 00:36:14,039
A car's coming!

340
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:17,793
It went in!

341
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,546
It's going in!

342
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,133
Check out this other one!

343
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:29,303
Everything's okay!

344
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:05,421
Sorry I'm late, the Councilman,
City Hall, the traffic...

345
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:09,007
- My father.
- How do you do.

346
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:14,512
I'm glad he's with you
you're a good person.

347
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:17,765
He's in your care.

348
00:37:17,892 --> 00:37:20,310
He's a clever guy.

349
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:23,813
I don't doubt that, but...

350
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:26,106
- Having work is important to him.
- Of course.

351
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:28,650
I tried so hard
to find him work in Naples...

352
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:32,821
- Where do you work?
- In the hospital, intensive care.

353
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:35,616
A bad division.

354
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:40,495
I tried to get him in,
but I have no connections.

355
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:43,748
He's all set now.

356
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,083
You did something no one else did.

357
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,794
I thank you, you raised him well.

358
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:50,838
Have you always worked in Naples?

359
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:53,716
No, also in Trieste, Udine,

360
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:56,802
Venice...
- That's where we're going.

361
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:59,554
I told him about Venice.

362
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:03,225
He's excited, it's his first time.

363
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:06,978
Dad, we have a plane.

364
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:11,107
Did you bring some things?

365
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:14,235
What's that, your gym bag?

366
00:38:14,402 --> 00:38:17,821
- Goodbye.
- He's in your care.

367
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,511
- What do you pay for disposal?
- Today I'm paying 50.

368
00:38:41,845 --> 00:38:43,054
Your offer?

369
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:45,515
We can halve your costs,

370
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:47,307
25 cents a kilo.

371
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,059
That's good,

372
00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:52,354
but is it all "clean",
like they say in the United States?

373
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,939
Since it's toxic waste,

374
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,525
certification,
storage and transportation.

375
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,322
- Is there a contract to look over?
- Of course.

376
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:08,619
In case you're wondering,

377
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:10,705
the disposal cycle

378
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:13,207
goes to the disposal area
in Marcianise.

379
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:15,793
I'm telling you in fairness.

380
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:19,088
Thank you for the information,

381
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:21,673
but my only concern
is that it's "clean".

382
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:24,092
You can rest assured of that.

383
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:28,430
We can dispose of all the waste
that you produce in a year.

384
00:39:28,556 --> 00:39:29,848
Eight hundred tons.

385
00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:31,391
Exactly.

386
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:33,810
It's not a problem.

387
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:35,103
That's a lot.

388
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:41,275
My concern is disposal.

389
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:45,070
We serve various companies,
you can check.

390
00:39:45,488 --> 00:39:48,240
I already have!

391
00:39:48,742 --> 00:39:50,242
Don't worry.

392
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:54,912
As far as I can see,
there's maximum transparency.

393
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,289
Absolutely.

394
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:02,587
- The warehouses at Teverola?
- We use them for tires.

395
00:40:02,713 --> 00:40:03,921
Exactly.

396
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:06,716
Will we put the tannery waste
in the quarry?

397
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:09,468
- Don't talk foolishness.
- Where then?

398
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:11,803
Check the European catalogue.

399
00:40:14,932 --> 00:40:16,975
Here they are, 04.

400
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:20,145
The ones in red,
are among the most dangerous.

401
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,149
"Exhausted degreasing baths
with solvents, no liquid phase."

402
00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:25,775
No, no good.

403
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,737
Then 4-11:

404
00:40:30,322 --> 00:40:33,324
"Waste containing halogenated
compounds from operations"

405
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,493
"of manufacturing and finishing."

406
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:36,869
These are good.

407
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:40,414
It's stuff the earth absorbs,
we'll mix it with compost.

408
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:43,500
Fertilizer!

409
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:48,254
All that leaves is
Milan's sweeping refuse,

410
00:40:48,381 --> 00:40:49,839
that's 60 trucks.

411
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:54,636
- The quarries at San Felice?
- They're too small.

412
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:57,679
I don't think so, look.

413
00:40:57,806 --> 00:40:58,972
Let me see.

414
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:08,816
They're too small
and they're shallow,

415
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:10,442
they're no good.

416
00:41:22,788 --> 00:41:25,623
Yes... I've got
ten contracts out of ten.

417
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:31,670
Is he near you?

418
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:35,674
Put him on.

419
00:41:36,509 --> 00:41:38,009
I'll talk to him.

420
00:42:01,241 --> 00:42:04,159
I told him, everything's okay.

421
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:20,549
- Do you like traveling?
- Sure!

422
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:22,718
We'll take more trips.

423
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:34,771
Everyone here works in boats?

424
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:37,982
Everyone, firemen, ambulances...

425
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:42,945
- Funerals.
- I've already seen two.

426
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,323
Even the dead go by boat!

427
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:12,181
Wow, they've got so many!

428
00:43:16,603 --> 00:43:17,728
Steady me.

429
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,779
There's nothing here.

430
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:28,628
Nothing?

431
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:30,504
Are you sure?

432
00:44:57,698 --> 00:44:58,823
Oh God!

433
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,783
Look what's here!

434
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,250
See? It's like you said!

435
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:15,172
Look here!

436
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,674
A Beretta 93!

437
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,383
A Kalashnikov!

438
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:23,179
See if they're loaded.

439
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:25,306
- Check.
- It's unloaded.

440
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,489
Look, an M12!

441
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,116
This is the 921.

442
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,618
That bearded bum!

443
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:50,330
We'll see how
he blows my head off!

444
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,375
Enough for Casale di Principe!
Everybody!

445
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,419
Won't blow my head off now, eh?

446
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,550
Should I put two in?

447
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:07,763
And Nikita's?

448
00:46:08,013 --> 00:46:08,971
And the 38?

449
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:30,450
- Want to see how I can shoot?
- Show me!

450
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:32,744
Show me!

451
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:36,373
Aim there!

452
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:13,991
I hit it!

453
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:32,717
We'll blow
the Colombians' heads off!

454
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:42,935
That's good.

455
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,732
Everything okay?

456
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,406
With love and feeling.

457
00:48:09,711 --> 00:48:12,087
- What is it?
- Your wife's on the phone.

458
00:48:12,255 --> 00:48:13,798
Tell her not to wait up.

459
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:17,718
Don't get tired out, need anything?

460
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:19,052
No, thanks.

461
00:48:19,678 --> 00:48:21,471
- You'll lock up?
- Yes.

462
00:48:21,597 --> 00:48:23,598
Goodnight.

463
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:49,206
Xian?

464
00:49:25,073 --> 00:49:26,907
I have been waiting for you.

465
00:49:28,743 --> 00:49:31,954
- I got lost.
- I am happy you came.

466
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,302
Please sit down.

467
00:49:50,264 --> 00:49:52,849
We are cooking fish.

468
00:50:03,693 --> 00:50:05,611
I've already eaten.

469
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,363
Try a typical Chinese dish.

470
00:50:08,489 --> 00:50:09,531
Okay?

471
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:18,831
Just cooked, it is good.

472
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,750
Meat with bell peppers.

473
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:22,501
I've already eaten.

474
00:50:26,673 --> 00:50:28,090
Taste.

475
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,300
We use chopsticks.

476
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:32,677
- I don't know how to use them.
- Try!

477
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:37,390
I am pleased,

478
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:40,393
we have a little toast.

479
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:43,855
We go to the factory.

480
00:50:52,155 --> 00:50:53,155
Why not?

481
00:50:58,286 --> 00:51:00,120
I put a pillow in here.

482
00:51:00,246 --> 00:51:01,789
It's dangerous.

483
00:51:03,332 --> 00:51:07,293
I already told you,
no one can know, just us.

484
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,754
It's better for both of us.

485
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,675
- Won't I need air?
- No, there's an opening.

486
00:51:13,801 --> 00:51:19,096
I'll open the front window,
so air will come in.

487
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:22,099
Forgive me.

488
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:26,228
Are we sure?

489
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:31,984
It is best for both of us,
because it is dangerous.

490
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:36,988
- Does air come through here?
- Yes.

491
00:51:37,781 --> 00:51:40,241
And I'll open the window too.

492
00:52:44,844 --> 00:52:47,721
Please, come in, Mr. Pasquale.

493
00:52:48,848 --> 00:52:50,724
All are waiting for you.

494
00:52:53,853 --> 00:52:55,645
All are very happy.

495
00:53:10,952 --> 00:53:14,162
I told them who you are
and all are happy.

496
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:18,083
What a nice factory!

497
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:20,668
More than 80 people.

498
00:54:04,752 --> 00:54:06,211
I'm moved.

499
00:54:11,008 --> 00:54:12,676
What can I say?

500
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:16,513
To do this work

501
00:54:17,682 --> 00:54:19,598
you need lots of patience...

502
00:54:25,814 --> 00:54:27,148
...and lots of love.

503
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:35,738
For the first lesson...

504
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:41,786
...l'll cut out a bodice.

505
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,420
Let's begin.

506
00:55:01,848 --> 00:55:05,184
You must place patterns carefully.

507
00:55:12,065 --> 00:55:13,774
Spread the cloth well...

508
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:39,007
Maria, are you asleep?

509
00:55:44,512 --> 00:55:46,388
Where have I been, in China?

510
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:52,353
They were all bowing to me.

511
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:55,439
Master!

512
00:55:56,316 --> 00:55:58,024
They called me "master"!

513
00:56:04,073 --> 00:56:07,075
- Did you know the Chinese can cook?
- The Chinese?

514
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:08,993
Darn right!

515
00:56:10,246 --> 00:56:12,455
They cooked a delicious bass!

516
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:18,293
There were boxes everywhere

517
00:56:18,419 --> 00:56:20,462
and they put me in the trunk!

518
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:24,216
Both coming and going.

519
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:29,470
I need some sleep.

520
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,431
Here.

521
00:56:35,644 --> 00:56:38,062
I have to sleep a fow hours.

522
00:56:41,817 --> 00:56:43,442
What's this money?

523
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,330
Where did you get it?

524
00:56:57,999 --> 00:56:59,624
I have to sleep.

525
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:03,752
Help me understand.

526
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,672
I talked to my son this morning,

527
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:11,927
he said: "Mom I'm leaving,
I'm going to be a secessionist."

528
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,805
Really?

529
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:20,768
What did you say?

530
00:57:21,895 --> 00:57:23,479
He's convinced,

531
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:26,566
he said: "We're great,"

532
00:57:26,775 --> 00:57:29,819
"we'll win the war,
the others are nobodies."

533
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:34,115
War? A bunch of morons
warring against us?

534
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:36,575
You have to stop him.

535
00:57:38,786 --> 00:57:40,537
This side is the right side.

536
00:57:41,998 --> 00:57:43,915
Have you seen what's happening?

537
00:57:45,043 --> 00:57:46,877
There are killings every day.

538
00:57:48,504 --> 00:57:51,589
Don't say anything to anybody,
not even your husband.

539
00:57:53,258 --> 00:57:54,675
Who'd ever tell him!

540
00:57:57,179 --> 00:58:00,848
When he gets out, what'll he do?
Father and son will kill each other?

541
00:58:00,974 --> 00:58:03,601
No, because your son
will stay right here.

542
00:58:05,645 --> 00:58:07,562
They'll all come to a bad end.

543
00:58:12,443 --> 00:58:14,361
Do you feel so sure about that?

544
00:58:14,779 --> 00:58:15,945
I don't.

545
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:18,448
I do.

546
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:13,666
When will we see each other again?

547
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:15,418
When you change sides.

548
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,003
Want to stay faithful? Go ahead!

549
00:59:18,672 --> 00:59:21,090
You go your way and I go another.

550
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,718
But we can still have
a pizza together with friends.

551
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:26,971
I'm telling you again,

552
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:29,222
friend, enemy.

553
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:35,395
We've known each other for so long,
why go with them?

554
00:59:35,521 --> 00:59:38,606
Remember when we were brothers?
Now we're enemies.

555
00:59:41,819 --> 00:59:45,362
I'm telling you, if you don't
change sides, we might kill you

556
00:59:45,488 --> 00:59:47,990
or you might kill us.

557
00:59:48,908 --> 00:59:51,493
Because we're at war,

558
00:59:51,703 --> 00:59:53,662
people are dying every day.

559
00:59:59,544 --> 01:00:02,211
- You could have stayed with us...
- What for?

560
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:04,297
I'm best on the other side.

561
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:18,602
Bye, Simone.

562
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:27,875
Want a little Sambuca?

563
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:35,841
You'll be right off, don't worry.

564
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:37,927
Takes time.

565
01:01:55,987 --> 01:01:58,112
Careful when you go out.

566
01:01:58,238 --> 01:01:59,280
Thank you.

567
01:03:32,285 --> 01:03:33,661
Gaetano, show him.

568
01:03:35,037 --> 01:03:36,913
- It's big.
- You're right.

569
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,956
- Enzo!
- What?

570
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:41,542
Do I have to tell you?

571
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:46,214
It's awesome.

572
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:48,466
I like it.

573
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:49,717
Like it?

574
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,552
You look great.

575
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:54,137
Totò, show it off.

576
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:57,933
It's really nice.

577
01:04:08,485 --> 01:04:10,653
- How many so far?
- 45 doses.

578
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:12,113
Okay.

579
01:04:14,449 --> 01:04:15,700
It's good stuff.

580
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:31,131
How many so far?

581
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:35,677
Fifty-two,
plus four that guy's still got.

582
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,805
- Understand?
- Yeah.

583
01:04:45,937 --> 01:04:47,730
I'll get back to you later.

584
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:54,445
- How many?
- Fifty-two and that guy's got four.

585
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:56,404
Then we'll total it.

586
01:05:02,786 --> 01:05:04,036
Hello!

587
01:05:06,707 --> 01:05:08,207
Nice, eh?

588
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,710
Hi, gorgeous!

589
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:13,545
- Girls!
- Beautiful!

590
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:15,338
Alessia?

591
01:05:19,844 --> 01:05:23,054
What are you doing here?
Get out.

592
01:05:24,265 --> 01:05:27,058
I don't want to see you around here.

593
01:05:28,602 --> 01:05:31,353
We have to go crying
at the prison gates?

594
01:05:31,646 --> 01:05:34,815
What I went through with your father
was enough for me.

598
01:07:38,933 --> 01:07:40,224
Good morning, Jacob.

599
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:42,351
- Are you alright?
- Fine, thanks, and you?

600
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:44,770
Have a good trip?

601
01:07:46,023 --> 01:07:48,733
A very nice trip.

602
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:52,862
- Do you have documents?
- It's humanitarian aid.

603
01:07:52,988 --> 01:07:54,906
Yes, it's humanitarian aid.

604
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,617
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

605
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:04,915
They've already called an ambulance.

606
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:09,085
Get back to work!

607
01:08:09,337 --> 01:08:11,504
Go back to work!

608
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,466
What happened?

609
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,679
As they were dumping,

610
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,892
two drums opened
and spilled on a truck driver.

611
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,186
- Have you already called Zio?
- No!

612
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:30,813
- They wanted to call an ambulance!
- I'll take care of this.

613
01:08:34,234 --> 01:08:36,736
Pay the truckers
and tell them to fuck off.

614
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:41,616
- Who'll drive the trucks?
- Don't the blacks know how?

615
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:43,451
Can you drive?

616
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,869
They can't even ride bikes!

617
01:08:48,498 --> 01:08:50,123
I'll handle this.

618
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:53,919
Don't let them touch the trucks,
they're ours.

619
01:08:55,922 --> 01:08:57,214
Roberto, wait here.

620
01:08:58,007 --> 01:08:59,383
Calm down!

621
01:09:05,138 --> 01:09:10,685
You made a mistake, you had us doing
a job we shouldn't have!

622
01:09:10,852 --> 01:09:14,438
It just happened!

623
01:10:01,233 --> 01:10:03,151
- I'm taking the red one.
- No, that's mine!

624
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:14,578
- Take that one.
- I'll take this one!

625
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:22,794
- I'm not tall enough!
- Climb up there!

626
01:10:27,758 --> 01:10:30,634
Wake up, get some cushions!

627
01:10:36,058 --> 01:10:38,726
- The keys?
- Look under the seat!

628
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,899
Come on! Are you sleeping?

629
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:48,735
Can't you see there's work to do?

630
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:50,612
Put this under your butt!

631
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,240
Put it under your butt.

632
01:10:54,658 --> 01:10:57,076
Go slowly
and drive the truck down there.

633
01:10:58,161 --> 01:11:00,454
Then I'll pay you.

634
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:06,210
Catch this cushion.

635
01:11:10,048 --> 01:11:11,256
Come on!

636
01:11:15,219 --> 01:11:17,345
Go slow!

637
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:23,059
Move forward
and make space for that one!

638
01:11:23,393 --> 01:11:25,394
Roberto, tell him what to do!

639
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:27,313
All the way down there!

640
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:22,421
- What is it?
- It's the new list.

641
01:13:23,923 --> 01:13:25,924
Have you already paid
the Mellone family?

642
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:28,259
And the redhead's family too?

643
01:13:28,802 --> 01:13:29,761
Of course.

644
01:13:29,887 --> 01:13:31,221
Wasted money.

645
01:13:32,723 --> 01:13:34,891
Let's make not make
these mistakes anymore.

646
01:13:35,017 --> 01:13:36,559
Are these the only ones?

647
01:13:38,646 --> 01:13:40,646
More money and less work.

648
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:42,940
But more risk.

649
01:13:43,483 --> 01:13:45,817
What risk?

650
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:48,862
Just don't go into certain areas,

651
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,074
the Seven Buildings, the Smurf Houses
and the Blue Houses.

652
01:13:52,242 --> 01:13:54,409
As for the rest,
you can go anywhere.

653
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:57,954
Maria's not here,
I already paid her.

654
01:14:00,707 --> 01:14:03,876
- Isn't her husband with us?
- Yes, but her son betrayed.

655
01:14:04,002 --> 01:14:05,461
They mustn't get a cent.

656
01:14:09,174 --> 01:14:12,425
These things are none of your affair,
respect the list.

657
01:14:32,654 --> 01:14:33,821
Who is it?

658
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:47,208
What is it?

659
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:49,419
- Not letting me in?
- Tell me.

660
01:14:51,422 --> 01:14:52,588
No one's home.

661
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,215
The week's pay.

662
01:14:54,341 --> 01:14:57,343
- Sure, but no one's home.
- I'll leave it with you.

663
01:14:58,137 --> 01:15:00,263
Just a minute and I'll let you in.

664
01:15:11,316 --> 01:15:13,150
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

665
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:15,652
- You came by yourself?
- I'm alone!

666
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:18,821
I'm alone.

667
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:22,116
You can give this pittance
to your cronies, hear me?

668
01:15:25,203 --> 01:15:27,747
Where's the list?

669
01:15:29,207 --> 01:15:32,126
Don't move!
Put your hands on the floor.

670
01:15:33,878 --> 01:15:37,005
You put our names
together with your cronies'?

671
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:38,298
Motherfucker!

672
01:15:38,674 --> 01:15:41,009
We hate those people.

673
01:15:41,135 --> 01:15:43,845
Tell your friends that we'll come
get them in their homes

674
01:15:43,971 --> 01:15:47,682
and we'll shoot them
in the head like you!

675
01:15:49,435 --> 01:15:51,560
- How did you get here?
- On my motorbike.

676
01:15:51,686 --> 01:15:54,605
- Now I'll shoot him.
- Not in here.

677
01:15:55,231 --> 01:15:56,774
Go get your bike.

678
01:15:58,234 --> 01:16:00,402
Is anyone here?

679
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:02,196
Leave now!

680
01:16:54,204 --> 01:16:55,829
Don Ciro!

681
01:16:57,331 --> 01:16:58,957
What an idiot.

682
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:08,675
Don Ciro!
Where in hell are you going?

683
01:17:09,135 --> 01:17:10,552
He's nuts.

684
01:17:14,305 --> 01:17:17,141
You're acting like a skittish horse,

685
01:17:17,725 --> 01:17:19,476
where are you running to?

686
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:22,187
You made me take the steps
four at a time.

687
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,440
What can we do with you?

688
01:17:24,983 --> 01:17:26,817
Why are you running?

689
01:17:27,235 --> 01:17:30,027
A wild horse is what you seem.

690
01:17:32,072 --> 01:17:33,906
When will we talk a little?

691
01:17:36,076 --> 01:17:37,869
Not even answering?

692
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,706
I've got to see
what to do with this guy,

693
01:17:41,999 --> 01:17:43,583
I have to blast him.

694
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:47,043
What did you give me?
The same money again?

695
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,296
Is this guy an idiot?

696
01:17:49,589 --> 01:17:53,425
Or are they making him
be an asshole?

697
01:17:53,843 --> 01:17:57,095
Waiting for me to lose my head?

698
01:17:57,847 --> 01:17:59,306
What can I do?

699
01:18:06,563 --> 01:18:07,980
Let's do a stick-up?

700
01:18:08,857 --> 01:18:10,274
A stick-up.

701
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:12,234
- What?
- A stick-up.

702
01:18:12,736 --> 01:18:16,697
- No way!
- Let's do it!

703
01:18:16,823 --> 01:18:21,201
- Stick-up a video games room?
- Our money's run out.

704
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:25,163
- What can this place have?
- Money!

705
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:28,208
Listen to me for once.

706
01:18:28,792 --> 01:18:31,461
Cut the bullshit!

707
01:18:32,129 --> 01:18:34,796
- A hold-up, no way!
- Listen to me.

708
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:38,008
Let's play one more euro and go home.

709
01:18:38,426 --> 01:18:40,886
We're out of money!

710
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:45,933
They must have about 50 cents.

711
01:18:46,059 --> 01:18:47,559
Do we do it or not?

712
01:18:48,895 --> 01:18:51,604
You get that one and
I'll take these guys down.

713
01:18:52,773 --> 01:18:55,816
- See all the people.
- It'll work!

714
01:18:56,777 --> 01:18:58,277
Something fast.

715
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,243
Are you ready?

716
01:19:07,078 --> 01:19:08,370
Yes or no?

717
01:19:11,874 --> 01:19:13,625
This is a hold-up!

718
01:19:14,961 --> 01:19:17,254
On the floor!

719
01:19:20,216 --> 01:19:22,259
Get out of there!

720
01:21:11,862 --> 01:21:14,197
- She's hot!
- She sucks.

721
01:21:14,823 --> 01:21:16,199
What!

722
01:21:17,867 --> 01:21:21,119
- You like her?
- What's not to like!

723
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:23,872
You like one thing,
I like another.

724
01:21:27,794 --> 01:21:28,835
Right now!

725
01:21:32,715 --> 01:21:35,800
- The blonde in the side room?
- Yeah.

726
01:21:36,176 --> 01:21:37,259
Hillary?

727
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,146
Right away!

728
01:21:51,857 --> 01:21:53,400
I can't even stand still.

729
01:21:53,526 --> 01:21:55,026
I'll let you back in later.

730
01:22:01,242 --> 01:22:03,034
- What's your name?
- Kristal.

731
01:22:05,912 --> 01:22:08,580
- What do you want to do?
- Everything.

732
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:13,752
Have you ever stripped a girl?
I'll teach you.

733
01:22:13,878 --> 01:22:16,338
- You're the first.
- You go really slow.

734
01:22:18,216 --> 01:22:22,719
- I'm too horny.
- Sure, but you have to go slow.

735
01:22:27,516 --> 01:22:29,559
You have to strip right away.

736
01:22:37,818 --> 01:22:39,151
What do we do?

737
01:22:43,614 --> 01:22:45,031
Want to have sex?

738
01:22:45,616 --> 01:22:47,117
Wait!

739
01:22:48,202 --> 01:22:49,411
Such a hurry!

740
01:23:05,427 --> 01:23:06,594
Did I hurt you?

741
01:23:07,345 --> 01:23:11,056
- Why not?
- Don't bite, it hurts.

742
01:23:16,312 --> 01:23:18,688
Hey, zip up!

743
01:23:19,064 --> 01:23:20,565
Zip up!

744
01:23:21,025 --> 01:23:23,985
- Look, I'll call...
- Call who you want.

745
01:23:24,111 --> 01:23:25,236
Zip up!

746
01:23:25,529 --> 01:23:26,529
Come here!

747
01:23:26,655 --> 01:23:29,198
- Now!
- You do it.

748
01:23:31,201 --> 01:23:34,203
- Like this?
- It's not allowed.

749
01:23:34,662 --> 01:23:36,330
Or I'll leave.

750
01:23:36,956 --> 01:23:39,208
Come here, I zipped.

751
01:23:40,835 --> 01:23:42,127
I'm gonna hurt you.

752
01:23:42,504 --> 01:23:45,671
No, I'm doing the hurting to you.

753
01:23:45,798 --> 01:23:48,174
- Really?
- What do you think?

754
01:24:07,985 --> 01:24:11,321
Don't do anything to me!

755
01:24:18,370 --> 01:24:22,456
Where are the weapons?

756
01:24:31,216 --> 01:24:34,717
I'll give you one day
to put them back!

757
01:24:35,052 --> 01:24:37,971
Get the message?

758
01:24:40,015 --> 01:24:43,560
- Do I shoot them in the head?
- Let them live a little more.

759
01:24:43,686 --> 01:24:46,604
Get back in the car.

760
01:24:48,732 --> 01:24:49,898
Get the message?

761
01:25:01,327 --> 01:25:03,370
Sweet Pea, get up!

762
01:25:06,456 --> 01:25:09,750
Don't be scared, I'm here,
we're at war!

763
01:25:09,877 --> 01:25:11,335
Get lost!

764
01:25:11,461 --> 01:25:13,129
Get up!

765
01:25:19,344 --> 01:25:21,053
Enough!

766
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:22,971
Come here, don't worry!

767
01:25:23,389 --> 01:25:26,766
- I'm getting out of here.
- No!

768
01:25:26,893 --> 01:25:29,019
We'll beat these guys!

769
01:25:29,353 --> 01:25:31,229
Listen to me!

770
01:25:51,082 --> 01:25:53,667
You're making me waste time,

771
01:25:54,668 --> 01:25:57,337
you said you made a mark,
but where is it?

772
01:25:57,463 --> 01:25:59,255
Oh, what is it?

773
01:26:04,219 --> 01:26:08,431
- Remember I made a mark!
- Yeah, but you can't find it!

774
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:13,518
You're as dumb as they come.

775
01:26:27,824 --> 01:26:29,825
Took you half an hour!

776
01:26:29,952 --> 01:26:31,702
Let's move, I have to shoot,

777
01:26:32,037 --> 01:26:34,956
I can't stand not shooting!

778
01:26:35,165 --> 01:26:37,166
- Want to shoot?
- Right away!

779
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:42,380
- Did you load it?
- You'd better shut up.

780
01:26:42,506 --> 01:26:44,381
Sweet Pea, do like I tell you.

781
01:26:46,342 --> 01:26:48,760
I don't give a fuck what you think.

782
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:52,555
We break everyone's balls,
but who've we killed?

783
01:26:52,682 --> 01:26:54,641
Do like I say and get moving!

784
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:55,850
Move!

785
01:26:56,227 --> 01:27:00,980
Where are we going?

786
01:27:01,272 --> 01:27:02,940
Do I have to beat you up?

787
01:27:03,066 --> 01:27:07,236
Do we have to war with each other?

788
01:27:07,696 --> 01:27:11,281
I'm not warring with you,
all we have to do is shoot!

789
01:27:11,574 --> 01:27:14,952
- We're going to shoot alone?
- Yeah, just you and me!

790
01:27:15,078 --> 01:27:18,246
- Not thinking about later?
- I don't want to think a thing!

791
01:27:18,372 --> 01:27:23,376
Want to take the wrong steps,
we'll never grow that way.

792
01:27:23,502 --> 01:27:25,795
Listening to you, we'll die sooner.

793
01:27:26,547 --> 01:27:28,339
Can I say something?

794
01:27:30,551 --> 01:27:34,219
Those kids don't know how to behave,
they're just raising Cain.

795
01:27:34,804 --> 01:27:37,055
- Why?
- They didn't give the weapons back.

796
01:27:37,181 --> 01:27:38,890
They don't want to listen.

797
01:27:39,308 --> 01:27:41,727
I'll make them listen my way.

798
01:27:45,148 --> 01:27:47,315
I'll take these guys and kill them.

799
01:27:50,485 --> 01:27:52,528
If you kill two kids,

800
01:27:52,654 --> 01:27:55,072
what shits will we look like
in the territory

801
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:58,284
when people find out?

802
01:27:58,618 --> 01:28:00,494
Are we joking?

803
01:28:02,247 --> 01:28:06,666
Then the cops come,
we have to lay low for a month

804
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:09,502
and all the traffic ends.

805
01:28:12,798 --> 01:28:16,676
Zio Vittorio, they can't be
lording it around in my area,

806
01:28:16,802 --> 01:28:20,638
they've already done so much,
I've warned them more than once.

807
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:22,806
I can't consider them kids anymore.

808
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:25,768
They have to die, that's final!

809
01:28:26,644 --> 01:28:29,980
You're right,
but first let's tell the families.

810
01:28:30,106 --> 01:28:32,149
I don't know who they are.

811
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,236
Will you take care of it?

812
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:40,490
I'll handle it!

813
01:29:08,184 --> 01:29:09,434
Totò, is that you?

814
01:29:16,316 --> 01:29:19,110
- What happened to Silvana?
- In the storeroom.

815
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:37,752
How come it's so dark?

816
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:40,296
Why are you in the dark?

817
01:29:40,422 --> 01:29:42,090
It's okay like this.

818
01:29:43,591 --> 01:29:45,300
Your change.

819
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:50,305
- The bread?
- There wasn't any.

820
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:53,392
- What'll we eat?
- There's pasta.

821
01:29:56,521 --> 01:29:58,605
- Take your change.
- It's for you.

822
01:30:08,198 --> 01:30:12,201
Why did you put her
in the storeroom?

823
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:14,495
She's fine where she is.

824
01:30:15,789 --> 01:30:17,747
She's just an animal!

825
01:31:32,486 --> 01:31:35,488
Come here a minute,
I have to talk to you.

826
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:38,740
Don't come out, it's dangerous.

827
01:31:39,158 --> 01:31:40,992
Come on, no one can see you.

828
01:31:44,872 --> 01:31:46,706
What are you doing, you're going?

829
01:31:50,628 --> 01:31:51,878
Listen to me!

830
01:31:52,838 --> 01:31:54,546
They said I have to leave.

831
01:31:55,757 --> 01:31:57,341
I have to leave my house.

832
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,927
I can't do anything.

833
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,470
I'm not leaving!

834
01:32:03,848 --> 01:32:05,224
Come here a minute!

835
01:32:12,064 --> 01:32:15,608
Tell those friends of yours
I'm not leaving!

836
01:32:17,069 --> 01:32:19,320
Tell those nice people!

837
01:32:19,488 --> 01:32:22,991
I won't betray my son
and I'm not moving from here!

838
01:32:25,452 --> 01:32:27,035
Not coming in for coffee?

839
01:32:27,161 --> 01:32:29,079
Run off, run away!

840
01:33:10,286 --> 01:33:11,703
Hello, accountant.

841
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:13,830
Please come in.

842
01:33:15,207 --> 01:33:18,083
Why this sudden call?

843
01:33:18,335 --> 01:33:19,710
You're worrying me.

844
01:33:19,836 --> 01:33:22,296
The designers pay me after 60 days,

845
01:33:22,422 --> 01:33:24,965
I have a little money,

846
01:33:25,258 --> 01:33:27,134
but this wasn't the agreement.

847
01:33:28,094 --> 01:33:29,845
Money isn't the problem.

848
01:33:31,681 --> 01:33:32,805
What is it then?

849
01:33:33,432 --> 01:33:35,516
It seems

850
01:33:36,518 --> 01:33:38,686
the problem is in your own house.

851
01:33:40,105 --> 01:33:41,606
In my house?

852
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:43,649
What problem is it?

853
01:33:45,361 --> 01:33:47,153
One of your associates,

854
01:33:48,572 --> 01:33:50,197
Pasquale Del Prete,

855
01:33:50,323 --> 01:33:52,115
has sold out to the Chinese.

856
01:34:02,835 --> 01:34:04,044
We're done.

857
01:34:08,507 --> 01:34:10,049
The finishing touches...

858
01:34:19,184 --> 01:34:20,643
I never doubted.

859
01:34:41,621 --> 01:34:42,788
Everything okay?

860
01:34:46,251 --> 01:34:49,420
Remember the first time
I put you to work in the factory?

861
01:34:49,879 --> 01:34:51,380
You were just a kid.

862
01:34:54,174 --> 01:34:55,383
Right.

863
01:35:05,436 --> 01:35:07,395
- Everything alright?
- Yes.

864
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:22,200
Pasquale Del Prete.

865
01:35:32,043 --> 01:35:35,463
Tell him to go slower, not too fast.

866
01:35:49,852 --> 01:35:51,102
Well done, Giulia.

867
01:35:51,896 --> 01:35:53,062
She's good.

868
01:36:25,427 --> 01:36:27,386
In the morning I do Tai Chi.

869
01:36:27,888 --> 01:36:28,888
Really?

870
01:36:29,014 --> 01:36:32,182
- It's nice.
- It is good for your health.

871
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,559
It is like in China.

872
01:36:34,685 --> 01:36:40,524
When you go to the park
in the morning, it is full of people,

873
01:36:41,067 --> 01:36:43,777
old people too.

874
01:36:43,903 --> 01:36:45,403
All doing Tai Chi.

875
01:36:45,696 --> 01:36:48,156
Everyone

876
01:36:48,491 --> 01:36:51,033
likes the culture of Tai Chi.

877
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:56,413
It's a tradition of Chinese culture.

878
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:58,624
When will you do egg rolls for me?

879
01:37:55,595 --> 01:37:57,095
Wait up.

880
01:37:59,223 --> 01:38:03,560
I spoke to the doctors,
you'll soon be released.

881
01:38:09,734 --> 01:38:11,191
Damn you,

882
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:13,902
you really goofed up.

883
01:38:16,281 --> 01:38:20,034
They loved the models,
they've asked for more...

884
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,660
You knew everything.

885
01:38:22,037 --> 01:38:23,996
That's how I saved your life.

886
01:38:25,582 --> 01:38:28,583
Those people don't kid around.

887
01:38:28,751 --> 01:38:30,376
Leave me alone.

888
01:38:30,502 --> 01:38:34,380
You should thank me,
those guys will kill you.

889
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,342
You and I pulled through.

890
01:38:37,468 --> 01:38:40,219
- Find another tailor.
- Why do you say that?

891
01:38:40,346 --> 01:38:43,847
- I want to be alone.
- How can I do this without you?

892
01:38:44,098 --> 01:38:45,432
I really don't care.

893
01:38:45,558 --> 01:38:49,853
- After all I've done for you.
- What have you done for me?

894
01:38:49,979 --> 01:38:53,523
I took you off the streets,
I fed you for years.

895
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:57,361
- You've used me since I was a kid.
- Don't say that!

896
01:38:58,655 --> 01:39:02,740
When you're better,
come see me, I'll give you a raise.

897
01:39:04,618 --> 01:39:08,412
Rosa, give me that bike,
I have to go.

898
01:40:37,372 --> 01:40:38,663
No admittance here,

899
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:40,206
that's it.

900
01:40:56,264 --> 01:40:57,848
Want to give up?

901
01:40:58,475 --> 01:41:00,684
Are we meat for the slaughter house?

902
01:41:09,694 --> 01:41:11,903
Let's shoot,
we'll rack up corpses too.

903
01:41:12,029 --> 01:41:13,154
Corpses?

904
01:41:14,573 --> 01:41:17,950
- I'm not moving without orders.
- What orders?

905
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:21,078
We don't know how to move.

906
01:41:22,831 --> 01:41:24,332
We don't know anything.

907
01:41:28,336 --> 01:41:30,170
Do we have to keep taking it?

908
01:41:30,505 --> 01:41:34,841
Do we have to wait for orders?

909
01:41:36,594 --> 01:41:38,053
Let's rack up corpses.

910
01:41:38,429 --> 01:41:42,140
What are we waiting for,
to be put down one by one?

911
01:41:46,478 --> 01:41:48,813
If we don't move,
nothing will change.

912
01:41:48,939 --> 01:41:51,357
No use feeling depressed.

913
01:41:52,984 --> 01:41:55,569
We all have to be convinced.

914
01:41:55,695 --> 01:41:58,322
But without orders,
I'm not moving.

915
01:42:00,741 --> 01:42:02,408
This is open war,

916
01:42:02,576 --> 01:42:04,494
you mustn't think about anyone.

917
01:42:05,287 --> 01:42:07,872
- Who do we kill?
- Let's begin in our area.

918
01:42:10,042 --> 01:42:11,876
From our own stronghold.

919
01:42:12,002 --> 01:42:14,838
We don't know who's with us
and who's against us,

920
01:42:14,964 --> 01:42:17,589
who do we make pay?

921
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:20,509
Where do you think
the order to kill came from?

922
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:22,761
Think!

923
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:26,390
Where did it come from?

924
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:29,393
- From there of course.
- From our own area.

925
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:31,311
She betrayed us.

926
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:33,813
We don't touch women.

927
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:36,399
Don't yell!

928
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,234
What are you saying?

929
01:42:42,489 --> 01:42:46,617
Don't take it out on someone
no part of this, but the son.

930
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:49,911
- How do we find him?
- His mother's in our district.

931
01:42:50,121 --> 01:42:52,372
It was her son who killed Gaetano.

932
01:42:52,665 --> 01:42:54,666
Let's think what we'll do.

933
01:42:55,710 --> 01:42:57,252
We could use the kid.

934
01:42:57,753 --> 01:42:59,921
He's the only one
who can get to her.

935
01:43:02,091 --> 01:43:03,592
He brings her shopping,

936
01:43:03,926 --> 01:43:06,135
he's in good with the woman...

937
01:43:07,137 --> 01:43:09,221
So, if we have to do it,

938
01:43:09,347 --> 01:43:10,764
we'll need his help.

939
01:43:13,768 --> 01:43:15,811
Totò, what do you think you'll do?

940
01:43:17,522 --> 01:43:19,523
Are you with us or against us?

941
01:43:26,113 --> 01:43:27,363
What do you say?

942
01:43:30,117 --> 01:43:31,868
Are you with us or not?

943
01:43:33,954 --> 01:43:36,539
- We'll see what we can do.
- No, "we'll see".

944
01:43:36,665 --> 01:43:39,082
Either you're with us
or you're against us,

945
01:43:40,084 --> 01:43:41,543
one or the other.

946
01:43:42,211 --> 01:43:46,089
If you're against us you can't leave,
we can't trust you.

947
01:43:46,424 --> 01:43:49,593
It can't have been her.

948
01:43:49,719 --> 01:43:51,553
This is our decision,

949
01:43:51,763 --> 01:43:53,638
you have to be with us.

950
01:43:53,931 --> 01:43:57,516
That's what we say,
you don't need to think.

951
01:44:02,189 --> 01:44:03,773
What are you going to do?

952
01:44:05,275 --> 01:44:08,527
- We'll see.
- I said no "we'll see".

953
01:44:24,752 --> 01:44:26,086
Come on down.

954
01:44:26,503 --> 01:44:28,379
I have to tell you something!

955
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:31,757
No, come down!

956
01:44:33,468 --> 01:44:35,344
Hurry, I have to leave!

957
01:46:16,648 --> 01:46:17,940
Sit down!

958
01:46:56,352 --> 01:46:58,061
You've known me for years,

959
01:46:58,270 --> 01:47:00,230
you know what I've always done.

960
01:47:02,566 --> 01:47:03,900
I brought the money.

961
01:47:04,068 --> 01:47:05,985
I brought it to your family, too.

962
01:47:08,614 --> 01:47:11,490
I did it because I was ordered to.

963
01:47:15,954 --> 01:47:17,496
War isn't for me.

964
01:47:18,581 --> 01:47:21,500
But you're in it, know that?

965
01:47:23,419 --> 01:47:24,837
Yes.

966
01:47:24,963 --> 01:47:25,963
So?

967
01:47:27,214 --> 01:47:28,172
You tell me.

968
01:47:28,298 --> 01:47:29,674
What can I tell you?

969
01:47:34,221 --> 01:47:35,972
What did you come here for?

970
01:47:38,642 --> 01:47:39,892
To talk to you.

971
01:47:40,978 --> 01:47:42,602
About what?

972
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:47,649
I want to save myself.

973
01:47:48,401 --> 01:47:50,277
You'll have to buy your life,

974
01:47:51,237 --> 01:47:53,155
I won't give it to you.

975
01:47:58,161 --> 01:47:59,493
What I did there,

976
01:48:00,871 --> 01:48:02,288
I can do for you here.

977
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:05,374
We don't need money-carriers,

978
01:48:06,084 --> 01:48:09,211
we have to score,
kill people, and we need money.

979
01:48:10,422 --> 01:48:12,047
You're wasting your time.

980
01:48:15,593 --> 01:48:17,010
You're more dead than alive.

981
01:48:17,136 --> 01:48:18,553
But we were brothers before.

982
01:48:18,679 --> 01:48:21,598
Before!

983
01:48:22,016 --> 01:48:24,517
Then they started
messing around with shit.

984
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:35,027
Our relatives were good people...
So they killed them!

985
01:48:37,238 --> 01:48:38,697
So, don't come asking

986
01:48:38,823 --> 01:48:40,490
to pass to the other side.

987
01:48:41,117 --> 01:48:43,368
We have to score, kill,

988
01:48:43,828 --> 01:48:45,245
and we need money.

989
01:48:46,539 --> 01:48:47,830
If not, you die,

990
01:48:48,207 --> 01:48:50,041
because you're part of the war.

991
01:48:50,751 --> 01:48:52,501
You bring money and I kill people,

992
01:48:52,628 --> 01:48:54,754
we're the same, you and me,
in this war.

993
01:48:57,174 --> 01:48:59,175
- I understand.
- You understand.

994
01:49:10,519 --> 01:49:12,229
Wait a moment.

995
01:49:43,634 --> 01:49:44,884
Everything okay?

996
01:49:47,805 --> 01:49:49,055
And you?

997
01:49:56,854 --> 01:49:58,063
That's four.

998
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,743
Face on the table!

999
01:50:13,829 --> 01:50:14,787
Done?

1000
01:50:14,913 --> 01:50:16,247
Let's go!

1001
01:50:24,089 --> 01:50:25,506
Come on out!

1002
01:50:26,299 --> 01:50:27,632
Lucky, eh?

1003
01:51:54,382 --> 01:51:56,925
That's poison.

1004
01:51:58,177 --> 01:51:59,344
What'd he say?

1005
01:51:59,553 --> 01:52:03,681
My father wants to say the dumping
you're doing on our land

1006
01:52:04,224 --> 01:52:05,891
isn't garbage.

1007
01:52:06,393 --> 01:52:07,643
It's poison.

1008
01:52:08,561 --> 01:52:09,853
It's not garbage?

1009
01:52:11,815 --> 01:52:13,565
You heard right.

1010
01:52:13,942 --> 01:52:15,484
Don't worry.

1011
01:52:16,194 --> 01:52:19,738
A year's gone by with this dumping?

1012
01:52:21,115 --> 01:52:24,659
So far,
all we've done is pay our debts.

1013
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:26,369
Just barely.

1014
01:52:26,703 --> 01:52:30,665
- Euro.
- I understand, Don Raffaele.

1015
01:52:33,544 --> 01:52:36,170
Everything costs double in euro.

1016
01:52:36,422 --> 01:52:37,421
And so?

1017
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:40,924
We need something more.

1018
01:52:42,468 --> 01:52:46,388
These are the prices,
explain it to your kids,

1019
01:52:46,889 --> 01:52:49,057
if I do it for you,
I have to do it for everyone.

1020
01:52:49,183 --> 01:52:50,809
Don't put me
in a difficult situation.

1021
01:52:50,935 --> 01:52:54,979
Okay, if you give us more,
everyone has to get more.

1022
01:52:55,105 --> 01:52:56,981
So, little can be done.

1023
01:52:57,107 --> 01:52:59,316
But, we barely make ends meet,

1024
01:52:59,443 --> 01:53:01,235
we can't go on like this.

1025
01:53:02,362 --> 01:53:03,821
We were thinking,

1026
01:53:05,824 --> 01:53:07,908
is it possible to do more dumping?

1027
01:53:11,078 --> 01:53:12,495
Euro...

1028
01:53:13,247 --> 01:53:14,622
More dumping?

1029
01:53:15,499 --> 01:53:18,793
We have another piece of land
for other dumping sites.

1030
01:53:18,919 --> 01:53:20,044
Near here?

1031
01:53:21,213 --> 01:53:22,547
Around here.

1032
01:53:23,090 --> 01:53:24,757
More dumping we do,

1033
01:53:25,217 --> 01:53:27,801
faster the ground gets filled.

1034
01:53:27,969 --> 01:53:31,472
You have another piece of land?

1035
01:53:31,598 --> 01:53:34,308
- Near here?
- Further on.

1036
01:53:34,434 --> 01:53:37,352
This other land
would be more convenient,

1037
01:53:37,645 --> 01:53:41,398
it's bigger and trucks
can get in easier.

1038
01:53:41,941 --> 01:53:43,232
But...

1039
01:53:45,694 --> 01:53:47,445
Still 100 euros per dumping.

1040
01:53:47,905 --> 01:53:49,655
What do you mean, 100 euros!

1041
01:53:49,865 --> 01:53:53,409
Don't speak out of turn.

1042
01:53:53,535 --> 01:53:55,495
- He can't increase!
- Who said so?

1043
01:53:55,621 --> 01:53:58,788
We'll increase the trucks.

1044
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,876
You have to increase
the price of each dumping.

1045
01:54:03,044 --> 01:54:04,628
Want to lose everything?

1046
01:54:04,754 --> 01:54:06,963
They have nowhere else to turn.

1047
01:54:07,173 --> 01:54:08,173
Excuse me.

1048
01:54:08,508 --> 01:54:09,758
Don't worry.

1049
01:54:12,637 --> 01:54:15,262
Alright, now we'll reach...

1050
01:54:19,434 --> 01:54:20,559
an agreement.

1051
01:54:20,685 --> 01:54:25,606
Give him a glass of water.

1052
01:54:25,732 --> 01:54:27,066
I'll do it, don't worry.

1053
01:54:35,783 --> 01:54:37,033
Luca!

1054
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:47,418
You have to clean up this field!

1055
01:54:47,835 --> 01:54:48,919
I'm not Luca.

1056
01:54:49,045 --> 01:54:50,420
Do a little work.

1057
01:54:51,798 --> 01:54:53,298
My name's Roberto.

1058
01:54:56,010 --> 01:54:58,554
This field is such a mess.

1059
01:54:59,430 --> 01:55:01,014
All such a mess.

1060
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:04,517
Ma'am, it's raining.

1061
01:55:04,893 --> 01:55:06,227
Should I stop?

1062
01:55:06,853 --> 01:55:08,187
Come out of there.

1063
01:55:11,275 --> 01:55:13,192
I'll take you inside.

1064
01:55:13,318 --> 01:55:15,236
I'll be right along.

1065
01:55:16,321 --> 01:55:17,989
They've made ditches here,

1066
01:55:18,115 --> 01:55:19,824
someone should come

1067
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:22,534
to fill them.

1068
01:55:24,579 --> 01:55:25,829
Let's go!

1069
01:55:50,228 --> 01:55:52,313
What beautiful peaches, thank you!

1070
01:55:53,606 --> 01:55:55,023
I'll take them to the kids.

1071
01:55:55,149 --> 01:55:57,400
See how beautiful they are!

1072
01:55:57,901 --> 01:55:58,860
Let's go.

1073
01:56:00,154 --> 01:56:01,571
Put them in the car.

1074
01:56:01,697 --> 01:56:03,114
Come on!

1075
01:56:17,003 --> 01:56:18,170
Toss that stuff.

1076
01:56:19,255 --> 01:56:20,839
- What?
- The peaches.

1077
01:56:20,965 --> 01:56:23,050
Can't you smell how they stink?

1078
01:56:45,154 --> 01:56:46,404
Done?

1079
01:57:04,422 --> 01:57:05,547
What?

1080
01:57:05,799 --> 01:57:07,091
Listen,

1081
01:57:08,093 --> 01:57:10,052
I've been thinking.

1082
01:57:11,221 --> 01:57:13,472
Maybe I'm not cut out for this work.

1083
01:57:13,765 --> 01:57:15,098
What?

1084
01:57:15,224 --> 01:57:17,684
I mean it.

1085
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:19,727
I'm not up to it.

1086
01:57:21,146 --> 01:57:22,897
We're doing so well!

1087
01:57:24,483 --> 01:57:25,608
No,

1088
01:57:26,527 --> 01:57:28,277
I don't want to work anymore,

1089
01:57:28,821 --> 01:57:29,946
I'm sorry.

1090
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:38,453
Think this job sucks?

1091
01:57:39,122 --> 01:57:42,290
You know that guys like me
put this shit country in Europe?

1092
01:57:43,835 --> 01:57:47,336
Know how many workers I've helped
by saving their companies money?

1093
01:57:47,462 --> 01:57:49,380
Stop and look!

1094
01:57:50,424 --> 01:57:51,549
What do you see?

1095
01:57:54,094 --> 01:57:55,261
Debts.

1096
01:57:56,012 --> 01:57:59,056
All these people have been saved
only thanks to us.

1097
01:58:01,351 --> 01:58:03,227
I saw how you help them live.

1098
01:58:04,145 --> 01:58:06,938
You save a worker in Mestre
and kill a family in Mondragone.

1099
01:58:07,064 --> 01:58:09,691
That's how it works,
but I didn't decide it.

1100
01:58:10,443 --> 01:58:13,153
We solve problems created by others.

1101
01:58:13,863 --> 01:58:15,864
I didn't create
chromium and asbestos,

1102
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:17,824
I didn't dig up the mountain.

1103
01:58:17,950 --> 01:58:20,617
That's how it works?

1104
01:58:20,744 --> 01:58:22,161
I don't work that way.

1105
01:58:23,872 --> 01:58:25,080
I'm not like you.

1106
01:58:25,206 --> 01:58:28,375
- What are you like?
- I'm different.

1107
01:58:32,922 --> 01:58:34,465
Go make pizzas!

1108
01:58:35,383 --> 01:58:36,716
He's different.

1109
01:58:39,803 --> 01:58:42,138
Don't think you're better than me!

1110
01:58:43,432 --> 01:58:45,183
I gave you a chance!

1111
01:58:48,187 --> 01:58:50,021
Go fuck yourself!

1112
01:59:49,994 --> 01:59:54,289
I think Scarlett Johansson's here!

1113
01:59:54,457 --> 01:59:56,166
Splendid, magnificent,

1114
01:59:56,668 --> 01:59:59,168
all dressed in white,

1115
02:00:01,505 --> 02:00:02,755
cream.

1116
02:00:03,465 --> 02:00:06,634
- In style with the film.
- Absolutely.

1117
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:10,137
Right colors,
right choice of dress.

1118
02:00:10,264 --> 02:00:16,017
It would be nice to know
why it took so long to get ready...

1119
02:00:16,936 --> 02:00:20,063
Because it's chic

1120
02:00:20,898 --> 02:00:23,024
yet so sophisticated.

1121
02:00:23,234 --> 02:00:27,821
An apparent simplicity,
but in reality, very elaborate...

1122
02:00:27,947 --> 02:00:29,739
Allow me to say...

1123
02:00:29,949 --> 02:00:33,409
Maybe to be awaited as a true star.

1124
02:00:33,660 --> 02:00:37,079
She's a star, and so beautiful.

1125
02:00:38,248 --> 02:00:40,583
The photographers are going crazy.

1126
02:00:42,586 --> 02:00:44,003
And the people too...

1127
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:54,693
May I sit at your table?

1128
02:02:00,617 --> 02:02:03,535
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- We don't smoke.

1129
02:02:05,789 --> 02:02:08,207
Everyone here talks about you.

1130
02:02:08,541 --> 02:02:12,126
You kids have balls, I can use you.

1131
02:02:12,503 --> 02:02:15,546
Why don't you join my guys?

1132
02:02:16,215 --> 02:02:18,216
You'll have money, motorbikes,

1133
02:02:18,384 --> 02:02:19,801
anything you want.

1134
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:22,261
I already saved you once,

1135
02:02:22,972 --> 02:02:25,806
because here
they don't like you guys.

1136
02:02:26,057 --> 02:02:28,058
You're causing too much trouble.

1137
02:02:29,143 --> 02:02:30,978
It's wise to be with me,

1138
02:02:31,104 --> 02:02:34,398
that way you don't have to worry,
you're covered.

1139
02:02:34,607 --> 02:02:36,191
We want to stay alone,

1140
02:02:36,693 --> 02:02:38,777
we don't want to be under anyone.

1141
02:02:40,029 --> 02:02:42,571
We don't like to be under people.

1142
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:45,658
We're just for us, that's all.

1143
02:02:47,327 --> 02:02:50,037
May I confide in you?

1144
02:02:50,163 --> 02:02:52,999
It's obvious you're courageous.

1145
02:02:53,125 --> 02:02:54,834
You're not talking to cops.

1146
02:02:56,837 --> 02:02:58,211
What is it?

1147
02:02:58,337 --> 02:03:01,965
I have a good job for you
and you'll earn a barrel of money.

1148
02:03:02,091 --> 02:03:05,385
- Money?
- Money's the first thing.

1149
02:03:05,511 --> 02:03:07,387
We know.

1150
02:03:09,432 --> 02:03:12,058
- May I come closer?
- Sure.

1151
02:03:12,852 --> 02:03:16,311
It's something not to be overheard,
just between us.

1152
02:03:16,563 --> 02:03:18,313
I need a big favor,

1153
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:20,816
you could do a "job" for me.

1154
02:03:20,942 --> 02:03:23,318
I see you've got balls,

1155
02:03:24,237 --> 02:03:28,157
but this guy's a hot one, he's big.

1156
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:30,658
We really like these things.

1157
02:03:31,076 --> 02:03:33,327
I'm crazy for them.

1158
02:03:33,954 --> 02:03:36,205
You have to kill Peppe the Horseman.

1159
02:03:36,331 --> 02:03:39,375
He's a traitor, he took my woman.

1160
02:03:41,795 --> 02:03:43,921
You have to shoot him in the balls

1161
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:46,340
and then in the mouth.

1162
02:03:46,508 --> 02:03:48,300
I go crazy for these things.

1163
02:03:49,719 --> 02:03:52,679
But you have to do me a favor.

1164
02:03:53,389 --> 02:03:58,226
They told me you
stole some weapons from around here.

1165
02:03:58,728 --> 02:04:02,939
You have to give them back,
we gotta make them disappear.

1166
02:04:03,899 --> 02:04:06,358
- I'll give you the weapons.
- You will?

1167
02:04:06,485 --> 02:04:08,194
Weapons, motorbikes,
anything you want.

1168
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,695
Let's talk about the money.

1169
02:04:09,821 --> 02:04:13,699
Tell me what you want
for this job.

1170
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:15,451
A really good amount.

1171
02:04:16,328 --> 02:04:18,496
Is 10,000 euro enough?

1172
02:04:21,082 --> 02:04:22,165
Yes.

1173
02:04:22,291 --> 02:04:25,460
I'll give you an advance,
the rest when the job's done.

1174
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:37,513
Put it in your pocket.

1175
02:04:38,932 --> 02:04:41,809
- Is it right?
- Fine.

1176
02:06:14,062 --> 02:06:15,897
- Not there.
- Then where?

1177
02:06:16,899 --> 02:06:19,692
- Where the fuck do we go?
- Who knows where he went!

1178
02:06:22,779 --> 02:06:24,614
- We lost him.
- Are you sure?

1179
02:06:27,659 --> 02:06:31,995
- Look over there.
- There's nothing.

1180
02:06:32,955 --> 02:06:35,790
Then where?

1181
02:06:35,917 --> 02:06:37,209
There he is!

1182
02:08:27,354 --> 02:08:28,521
Get off.

1183
02:08:43,745 --> 02:08:45,245
Come on!

1184
02:09:50,057 --> 02:09:52,475
For two kids such a waste of time.

1185
02:09:52,768 --> 02:09:54,394
Guys, it had to be done.

1186
02:09:54,728 --> 02:09:56,145
Everything's okay.

1187
02:11:48,083 --> 02:11:52,003
In Europe the Camorra has killed more
than all other criminal organizations.

1188
02:11:52,087 --> 02:11:54,964
4,000 deaths in the last 30 years,
one every three days.

1189
02:11:55,591 --> 02:11:59,218
Scampia is the biggest
drug-pushing locality in the world.

1190
02:11:59,303 --> 02:12:02,471
Daily sales per clan
run about 500,000 euro.

1191
02:12:02,973 --> 02:12:06,684
If clan-managed waste were piled,
it would reach 14,600 meters.

1192
02:12:06,768 --> 02:12:08,436
Everest is 8,850 meters.

1193
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:11,856
There is a 20% increase in cancer
in the poisoned areas.

1194
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:16,444
Gains from illegal activities are
reinvested in legal ones worldwide.

1195
02:12:16,528 --> 02:12:21,282
The Camorra has also invested
in the reconstruction of the Twin Towers.
