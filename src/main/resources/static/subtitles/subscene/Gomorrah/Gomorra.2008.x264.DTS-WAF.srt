00:02:40.50,00:02:42.13
How long you gonna be?

00:02:51.72,00:02:53.05
Be right out,

00:02:53.47,00:02:56.27
you're a pain!

00:03:23.33,00:03:24.33
Hey, American.

00:03:24.46,00:03:27.09
I'm still here, gettin' a manicure.

00:03:28.21,00:03:31.13
Things okay?

00:03:31.26,00:03:34.51
Gettin' tanned? Don't get burned!

00:03:34.93,00:03:36.26
Bruno's here too.

00:03:36.39,00:03:38.22
You got a crap body!

00:03:40.35,00:03:41.98
Is Bruno here?

00:03:42.23,00:03:43.73
He's over there.

00:03:51.40,00:03:52.65
You doin' a lamp?

00:05:03.02,00:05:04.27
It's 2,000.

00:05:04.39,00:05:06.65
How much are you[br]supposed to get this week?

00:05:07.48,00:05:08.61
9,200.

00:05:08.73,00:05:10.90
Sure? It was less last week.

00:05:13.78,00:05:15.78
Yes, Don Ciro, 9,200.

00:05:17.57,00:05:19.70
Another 2,000 euro and we're even.

00:05:20.87,00:05:22.66
Don Ciro, don't take all day.

00:05:23.12,00:05:24.33
He's slow.

00:05:26.33,00:05:28.08
Hurry, so we can go home.

00:05:30.29,00:05:31.50
Things okay out there?

00:05:32.71,00:05:34.09
Keep your eyes open.

00:05:44.64,00:05:45.77
That's it.

00:05:51.52,00:05:52.94
Put paper cups in.

00:05:58.20,00:06:00.12
Toilet paper.

00:06:07.00,00:06:09.37
- Then, Mom?[br]- Some shampoo.

00:06:12.04,00:06:13.09
A mozzarella...

00:06:18.13,00:06:20.89
Shampoo, not bath oil!

00:06:21.05,00:06:22.60
You're rushin' me!

00:06:22.72,00:06:25.47
And you're drivin' me crazy!

00:06:30.56,00:06:33.23
Hurry up, there are[br]more groceries to deliver.

00:06:33.82,00:06:35.73
- Nothing else?[br]- No.

00:06:40.74,00:06:43.41
- Be back later.[br]- Don't get yourself lost.

00:06:55.34,00:06:57.55
- Simone.[br]- Tot?, what's up?

00:06:57.67,00:07:00.09
- What's happening?[br]- I'm workin'.

00:07:02.47,00:07:05.47
Know what happened?[br]They arrested Vitale and Bon Bon.

00:07:05.81,00:07:07.02
Really?

00:07:07.14,00:07:10.52
- Got somethin' to eat?[br]- Yeah, but it's not mine.

00:07:11.10,00:07:13.52
Bye, see you.

00:07:29.79,00:07:31.21
Carmela, ma'am!

00:07:37.67,00:07:39.17
Hi, Boxer.

00:08:06.28,00:08:08.49
Two doses, two doses!

00:08:08.70,00:08:11.00
Please, give me a dose!

00:08:17.46,00:08:18.96
Gaetano, check it!

00:08:53.46,00:08:57.54
One, two, three...

00:09:00.30,00:09:02.17
Goodbye.

00:09:03.59,00:09:05.97
Don Ciro, be more punctual.

00:09:06.18,00:09:07.30
I'll pass it on.

00:09:16.40,00:09:17.94
Eleven and twelve.

00:09:18.52,00:09:20.11
See if he wants coffee.

00:09:20.57,00:09:22.61
No, but thank you anyway...

00:09:23.03,00:09:24.44
I'll show you out.

00:09:25.57,00:09:27.49
Have a good day.

00:09:36.04,00:09:37.42
Four hundred...

00:09:41.80,00:09:42.88
Five hundred.

00:09:43.01,00:09:46.42
The same amount again?

00:09:47.18,00:09:50.51
I've said a hundred times[br]I can't manage like this.

00:09:50.81,00:09:52.10
Don Carlo...

00:09:52.35,00:09:59.44
Did you tell them I can't manage[br]on this chickenfeed?

00:09:59.65,00:10:02.36
I have to pay rent, lights, water.

00:10:03.40,00:10:06.19
I can't survive,[br]I'm strapped with debts.

00:10:06.32,00:10:09.70
- I'll pass it on.[br]- You always say that!

00:10:09.82,00:10:13.24
Are you mockin' me?

00:10:13.49,00:10:15.20
I don't get it!

00:10:15.33,00:10:17.58
Listen,

00:10:17.71,00:10:19.54
I've got a son to support,

00:10:19.67,00:10:23.96
for forty years[br]I've kept him off the streets,

00:10:24.26,00:10:26.51
he's unemployed.

00:10:26.67,00:10:30.22
What can I do,[br]go over to the other side?

00:10:30.47,00:10:34.89
They know, I served you honestly[br]for forty years.

00:10:35.02,00:10:38.31
My wife's in jail,[br]is this the thanks we get?

00:10:38.48,00:10:40.90
Are we crazy?[br]Do I have to raise hell?

00:10:45.36,00:10:46.69
Silvana!

00:10:55.24,00:10:56.37
May I?

00:10:58.87,00:11:00.42
Come on in!

00:11:00.58,00:11:01.67
Maria!

00:11:04.46,00:11:05.55
The bill?

00:11:05.67,00:11:06.67
Talk to Mom.

00:11:14.22,00:11:16.01
Put this in your pocket.

00:11:17.18,00:11:18.48
Thank you.

00:11:32.20,00:11:34.32
Carabinieri on the street!

00:11:45.04,00:11:47.50
He's comin' out!

00:12:05.94,00:12:08.11
I'm the best, number one!

00:12:08.40,00:12:10.49
So?

00:12:10.61,00:12:11.61
Go, Marco!

00:12:11.74,00:12:15.24
- I'll blast these roaches![br]- Who do you think you're fighting?

00:12:15.37,00:12:19.99
I'm number one! Tony Montana!

00:12:20.12,00:12:22.62
The world is ours!

00:12:22.75,00:12:25.00
You don't know[br]who you're up against!

00:12:25.46,00:12:27.09
I'm Tony Montana!

00:12:27.29,00:12:30.38
- I'm the powerhouse![br]- Yeah!

00:12:30.63,00:12:31.88
Come here.

00:12:33.43,00:12:35.05
Shit Colombians,

00:12:35.55,00:12:36.93
they're everywhere.

00:12:38.35,00:12:41.14
See, Colombians everywhere.

00:12:44.69,00:12:46.65
You really looked like Scarface.

00:12:57.78,00:12:59.08
You were good.

00:12:59.54,00:13:03.00
Now it all has to be ours,[br]the whole world.

00:13:03.29,00:13:04.83
Miami, all of it.

00:13:19.56,00:13:22.64
My friend, got stuff?

00:13:31.90,00:13:33.07
You got stuff?

00:13:38.74,00:13:40.91
- Got good stuff?[br]- You got money?

00:13:41.62,00:13:45.33
- Sure, you got coke?[br]- What do you want to pay?

00:13:45.66,00:13:47.37
Me? 50.

00:13:49.63,00:13:54.30
- 55, can you do it?[br]- No, 55 is too much, 50.

00:13:54.80,00:13:56.67
You sure?

00:13:57.22,00:13:58.59
Wait here for me.

00:14:08.23,00:14:09.31
Where's Smarty?

00:14:28.25,00:14:30.00
Hey, kid!

00:14:43.01,00:14:44.35
Give him the money.

00:14:50.98,00:14:52.77
- Is it all here?[br]- Yeah.

00:15:09.67,00:15:11.54
- Okay?[br]- Yes.

00:15:15.50,00:15:17.63
- Want to see it?[br]- I want to try it.

00:15:20.18,00:15:21.80
I gave you the money!

00:15:21.93,00:15:23.34
Wait!

00:15:29.56,00:15:30.73
Open your hand.

00:15:34.77,00:15:35.90
It's good.

00:15:38.86,00:15:40.78
Give me all of it!

00:15:49.75,00:15:50.79
Grab the money!

00:17:01.53,00:17:03.32
Giovanni, I brought the kids.

00:17:03.86,00:17:05.03
Come in.

00:17:08.58,00:17:11.54
You know very well why you're here.

00:17:11.95,00:17:15.54
Too much ruckus going on in my area,[br]because I'm the boss here.

00:17:15.67,00:17:18.58
That's just you sayin'.

00:17:19.17,00:17:21.84
If I had you come here, I know.[br]No back-talk

00:17:21.96,00:17:25.05
or I'll smash your face!

00:17:25.18,00:17:28.93
- What happened?[br]- For the moment, nothing.

00:17:29.85,00:17:31.26
Get me?

00:17:31.43,00:17:35.43
I can't be made to look bad[br]because of two kids like you.

00:17:35.56,00:17:39.94
The next time[br]I hear anything about you,

00:17:40.07,00:17:41.90
I'll blow your heads off.

00:17:42.03,00:17:45.07
- If it's like you say...[br]- Shut up when I'm talkin'.

00:17:45.32,00:17:48.53
Then if I come to realize

00:17:48.66,00:17:51.12
you're worth something,

00:17:51.24,00:17:54.12
which I'll determine and I'll decide,

00:17:54.29,00:17:55.71
you can work for me.

00:17:55.91,00:17:57.21
Is that clear?

00:18:00.54,00:18:01.54
Show them out.

00:18:08.55,00:18:10.18
"I'll smash your face!"

00:18:10.35,00:18:12.10
And I'll tear your beard!

00:18:12.35,00:18:14.81
Without a T-shirt.

00:18:15.23,00:18:18.39
"Sweet Pea", looked like a bum.

00:18:19.10,00:18:20.35
A real bum.

00:18:20.48,00:18:23.19
He is a bum! Did you see[br]who he sent to get us?

00:18:23.32,00:18:26.74
If that guy's the boss here,

00:18:27.86,00:18:29.82
then here we can be the bosses.

00:18:31.16,00:18:35.49
If a guy like him is boss here,[br]this area is ours!

00:18:35.62,00:18:38.62
I'll live for 30 years[br]if he's boss here.

00:18:38.92,00:18:40.96
Sure, because he's a retard!

00:18:42.29,00:18:45.88
Get it? I'll live for 30 years.

00:18:46.01,00:18:48.67
But he could at least shave!

00:18:49.01,00:18:51.18
Shave!

00:18:51.39,00:18:52.89
"I'll smash your face!"

00:18:54.56,00:18:56.89
Let's go have a snort to spite him.

00:18:57.35,00:19:00.19
We've got everything,[br]we can do like we want.

00:19:04.19,00:19:06.32
Anyway, he's a fat shit-ass.

00:19:07.19,00:19:08.57
He bugged you?

00:19:08.74,00:19:10.74
He showers once a week!

00:19:15.62,00:19:17.66
"I'll blow your heads off!"

00:19:42.65,00:19:43.65
Roberto!

00:19:53.62,00:19:56.03
Let's go, it's too small.

00:19:56.16,00:20:00.50
- But the methane one's big.[br]- No, it's small.

00:20:00.66,00:20:04.63
- Can I finish measuring?[br]- No, we're wasting time.

00:20:07.71,00:20:11.42
- I have to take some shots.[br]- What a bore with these pictures!

00:20:11.55,00:20:12.76
Let's go!

00:20:19.27,00:20:20.60
Just look at this.

00:20:22.19,00:20:23.89
It's disgusting down there.

00:20:33.03,00:20:34.28
Here is perfect.

00:20:35.70,00:20:36.87
It's perfect.

00:20:37.66,00:20:40.91
We're near the highway,[br]the trucks can get really close,

00:20:41.54,00:20:44.25
they dump the earth[br]and cover all the water.

00:20:45.17,00:20:46.42
Perfect.

00:20:48.50,00:20:50.34
Franco, it's 85 meters.

00:20:50.63,00:20:52.05
Get the length too.

00:20:55.55,00:20:57.60
Come here.

00:21:00.14,00:21:01.27
Dante...

00:21:01.68,00:21:04.35
Hello, everything okay?

00:21:06.27,00:21:07.48
This is Roberto.

00:21:10.82,00:21:14.11
- It's time we made room for youth.[br]- We need new energy.

00:21:14.28,00:21:15.95
Take a few more shots.

00:21:18.20,00:21:19.95
Did you hear?

00:21:20.45,00:21:21.95
They bombed me,

00:21:22.08,00:21:24.00
at the cement plant.

00:21:24.92,00:21:28.08
A whole wall came down,

00:21:28.50,00:21:29.67
slowly.

00:21:30.30,00:21:31.63
Be careful.

00:21:31.76,00:21:33.67
Zio resolved it.

00:21:34.17,00:21:38.51
I'd forgotten to pay[br]for some land I'd bought.

00:21:38.64,00:21:40.85
- An injunction against payment?[br]- Yeah!

00:21:41.64,00:21:43.68
- What do you think?[br]- It's fine.

00:21:43.81,00:21:46.64
- Can we fill this quarry?[br]- Sure can.

00:21:46.77,00:21:49.69
Tell Zio it's fine.

00:21:51.11,00:21:55.82
Remember, everything clean:[br]Terracing, solid stuff...

00:21:55.99,00:21:58.95
Or the redevelopment agency[br]will break our balls.

00:21:59.07,00:22:04.75
Don't worry,[br]you emptied it and I'll fill it.

00:22:13.05,00:22:17.26
All the pieces have to be cut[br]and the sizes worked out.

00:22:18.80,00:22:20.80
They want 120 of these.

00:22:33.53,00:22:35.32
Six and seven are identical.

00:22:39.53,00:22:41.57
Here the satin is cut on the bias.

00:22:42.12,00:22:43.49
It's all hand-hemmed.

00:22:43.62,00:22:44.74
Is it tough?

00:22:44.87,00:22:48.96
The models aren't hard,[br]I can do it.

00:22:50.33,00:22:53.88
Eight hundred items in two months,[br]is our request.

00:22:54.46,00:22:58.38
Keep in mind[br]we start at 50 euros per item.

00:22:59.47,00:23:02.18
You've seen the models,[br]the price is good,

00:23:02.39,00:23:05.64
estimate and make your off?rs.

00:23:06.98,00:23:09.02
Thirty euro, 30 days?

00:23:09.60,00:23:11.23
Don't go any lower.

00:23:11.48,00:23:14.23
This is high fashion,[br]it's not pr?t-?-porter.

00:23:14.36,00:23:16.78
Forty-five, in two months.

00:23:18.36,00:23:20.49
- Ms. Zamarion![br]- Yes?

00:23:20.70,00:23:22.49
Thirty-eight, forty.

00:23:22.87,00:23:25.24
That's a very interesting proposal.

00:23:25.62,00:23:27.62
Thirty-five, thirty-five,

00:23:27.75,00:23:31.25
excellent workmanship[br]and delivery times respected.

00:23:31.63,00:23:33.46
Thirty, thirty!

00:23:41.80,00:23:43.43
Please,

00:23:43.72,00:23:46.14
we're not imposing anything!

00:23:47.27,00:23:50.10
Did we say thirty, thirty?

00:23:50.85,00:23:52.10
At this point

00:23:52.69,00:23:54.52
twenty-eight, thirty!

00:23:59.19,00:24:01.24
Thirty, twenty-five!

00:24:04.28,00:24:05.82
I can't lose this bid.

00:24:06.70,00:24:08.70
Come here, there's some bubbly!

00:24:11.33,00:24:12.67
Are they coming?

00:24:13.21,00:24:15.42
- I don't think so.[br]- Why not?

00:24:18.84,00:24:21.22
Five days less for delivery,

00:24:21.34,00:24:24.13
we'll have to work overtime,[br]and I'll do nights...

00:24:24.26,00:24:25.89
What's odd about that?

00:24:26.89,00:24:28.39
They're talking overtime pay.

00:24:28.52,00:24:30.64
They'll get it!

00:24:31.35,00:24:34.35
Am I scared of a little overtime?

00:24:36.31,00:24:37.61
Like the last time?

00:24:37.73,00:24:40.11
Don't worry,[br]this time it's a sure thing.

00:24:44.20,00:24:46.74
- They've lost their trust.[br]- I know.

00:24:47.16,00:24:51.16
- I asked you to talk to them.[br]- You do it, please.

00:24:51.29,00:24:54.75
You're on closer terms,[br]they respect you.

00:24:54.87,00:24:56.38
Do me this favor.

00:24:57.84,00:25:00.71
Don't say no, go talk to them.

00:25:01.80,00:25:03.38
You know I'm fond of you,

00:25:03.51,00:25:05.18
I'll have to make[br]a gold statue to you!

00:25:05.30,00:25:07.89
I'll go down and see the accountant[br]for the money.

00:25:14.27,00:25:16.69
Sorry, how much is this?

00:25:17.52,00:25:18.73
Ten thousand.

00:25:18.86,00:25:23.49
It's not enough, I need more.

00:25:24.11,00:25:25.53
Twice that at least.

00:25:25.82,00:25:28.62
Mr. Enzo,[br]you're already "complicated".

00:25:28.74,00:25:31.87
Yes, but for personal affairs.[br]I need this for work.

00:25:32.00,00:25:36.08
I'll give it back in three months.

00:25:36.21,00:25:37.96
But this isn't enough.

00:25:39.00,00:25:41.96
If you don't need it[br]and it's not enough,

00:25:42.09,00:25:43.42
I'll take it back.

00:25:43.55,00:25:45.38
It's best for you.

00:25:45.55,00:25:48.68
Don't be like that, listen,

00:25:48.80,00:25:51.31
I need at least double!

00:25:51.43,00:25:52.89
It's no risk,

00:25:53.02,00:25:54.73
you'll earn from it, right?

00:25:55.02,00:25:56.27
What can I say?

00:25:56.77,00:25:59.19
I'll pass it on,[br]can you make-do for now?

00:25:59.31,00:26:01.86
Yes, I'll take it.

00:26:13.12,00:26:15.08
Congratulations, Mr. Pasquale.

00:26:15.46,00:26:16.41
Thank you.

00:26:16.92,00:26:18.92
We met yesterday.

00:26:20.21,00:26:23.67
I need your help.

00:26:30.14,00:26:33.10
I'm having trouble with work.

00:26:33.52,00:26:38.73
I have to get into[br]haute couture right away,

00:26:39.48,00:26:43.44
but for me it is very difficult.

00:26:44.53,00:26:47.07
I need help.

00:26:50.24,00:26:51.49
You are

00:26:51.62,00:26:54.24
a great master,

00:26:54.45,00:26:57.29
you are very important for me.

00:26:57.91,00:27:00.71
You teach ten lessons

00:27:01.00,00:27:03.59
to workers in my factory.

00:27:04.55,00:27:07.80
I pay you in cash,

00:27:08.01,00:27:10.84
2,000 euros a lesson

00:27:11.55,00:27:13.47
for ten lessons.

00:27:13.97,00:27:17.73
We work together,[br]but no one knows it,

00:27:18.64,00:27:20.02
just the two of us.

00:27:22.06,00:27:23.56
I need your help.

00:27:25.57,00:27:26.90
Think it over.

00:27:31.82,00:27:34.20
- What's the cloth like?[br]- Come and see.

00:28:09.57,00:28:11.74
I've got nothin'!

00:28:13.57,00:28:16.28
Don't move!

00:29:19.60,00:29:22.27
They must have gone over to his side,

00:29:22.39,00:29:25.48
or they'd have arrested me first[br]and then those other guys.

00:29:26.35,00:29:28.86
Believe me? All of them were there[br]when I called you.

00:29:28.98,00:29:31.78
I said: "Check out this car,[br]it's suspect."

00:29:31.90,00:29:33.49
This stuff here is ours.

00:29:34.65,00:29:35.90
My gun!

00:29:38.41,00:29:41.41
Check this stuff out,[br]there should be fifty-six.

00:29:45.33,00:29:48.71
Good, Tot?, this is for you.

00:29:50.55,00:29:52.50
How can I get working with you?

00:29:52.76,00:29:54.97
We'll let you know.

00:29:57.05,00:29:59.39
- Did you turn off the water?[br]- Of course!

00:30:00.43,00:30:03.35
- Can I help out?[br]- No, you'll get wet.

00:30:03.47,00:30:04.56
Doesn't matter!

00:30:05.85,00:30:06.89
Come and see.

00:30:07.90,00:30:09.56
Careful not to slip.

00:30:11.02,00:30:15.61
- Is it coming from the well?[br]- No, I think it's from the pipe.

00:30:15.78,00:30:19.16
Careful, water's coming in.

00:30:19.82,00:30:21.70
See if you can close it.

00:30:22.49,00:30:25.25
It's closed,[br]but it's the pipe that...

00:30:31.42,00:30:33.42
I'd give you a hand, but...

00:30:34.92,00:30:36.51
What a great day!

00:30:36.63,00:30:38.43
Push it all in one direction.

00:30:45.77,00:30:47.94
I thought I'd be having coffee!

00:30:48.52,00:30:51.69
- Nice coffee, huh?[br]- I'll have some next time.

00:30:59.86,00:31:01.57
Totore, things okay?

00:31:03.95,00:31:06.62
- Can I say hi?[br]- No, you gotta leave.

00:31:06.83,00:31:09.08
Go down with these bags!

00:31:10.38,00:31:12.83
You have to move!

00:31:13.67,00:31:15.59
Ma'am, go around the other way.

00:31:15.71,00:31:18.30
- What's going on?[br]- Everything's fine, leave.

00:31:39.82,00:31:41.03
Lucia?

00:32:12.94,00:32:14.69
Come closer.

00:32:15.48,00:32:17.90
- What's your name?[br]- Luigi.

00:32:19.78,00:32:22.32
- Are you scared?[br]- No.

00:32:22.49,00:32:23.99
- Sure?[br]- No.

00:32:25.24,00:32:26.24
We'll see.

00:32:27.49,00:32:31.66
- Are you strong?[br]- Yeah!

00:32:31.91,00:32:33.75
Let's see how strong you are.

00:32:38.05,00:32:40.05
Why are you shaking?

00:32:41.67,00:32:42.92
No?

00:34:49.64,00:34:53.35
- See how strong this kid is.[br]- Come closer!

00:35:00.52,00:35:02.11
- Are you scared?[br]- Yes.

00:35:20.79,00:35:22.38
Now you're a man.

00:35:42.02,00:35:43.81
Nothin'! Everything's okay!

00:35:45.23,00:35:48.07
When I did my piercing,[br]I got an infection.

00:35:48.99,00:35:49.95
Let's see.

00:35:51.82,00:35:53.62
You went and did it there?

00:35:55.37,00:35:58.04
- I'd like to have it on my eyebrow.[br]- Stinks.

00:35:58.16,00:36:00.08
It's nicer there, you're right.

00:36:03.13,00:36:04.50
It's gonna rain.

00:36:05.92,00:36:07.80
Everything's okay!

00:36:10.80,00:36:14.18
A car's coming!

00:36:16.22,00:36:17.93
It went in!

00:36:20.31,00:36:21.69
It's going in!

00:36:23.15,00:36:25.27
Check out this other one!

00:36:27.98,00:36:29.44
Everything's okay!

00:37:01.98,00:37:05.56
Sorry I'm late, the Councilman,[br]City Hall, the traffic...

00:37:05.81,00:37:09.15
- My father.[br]- How do you do.

00:37:12.36,00:37:14.65
I'm glad he's with you[br]you're a good person.

00:37:15.91,00:37:17.91
He's in your care.

00:37:18.03,00:37:20.45
He's a clever guy.

00:37:20.58,00:37:23.96
I don't doubt that, but...

00:37:24.08,00:37:26.25
- Having work is important to him.[br]- Of course.

00:37:26.38,00:37:28.79
I tried so hard[br]to find him work in Naples...

00:37:28.92,00:37:32.96
- Where do you work?[br]- In the hospital, intensive care.

00:37:33.09,00:37:35.76
A bad division.

00:37:36.26,00:37:40.64
I tried to get him in,[br]but I have no connections.

00:37:40.77,00:37:43.89
He's all set now.

00:37:44.69,00:37:46.23
You did something no one else did.

00:37:46.35,00:37:48.94
I thank you, you raised him well.

00:37:49.36,00:37:50.98
Have you always worked in Naples?

00:37:51.11,00:37:53.86
No, also in Trieste, Udine,

00:37:54.07,00:37:56.95
Venice...[br]- That's where we're going.

00:37:57.07,00:37:59.70
I told him about Venice.

00:38:01.08,00:38:03.37
He's excited, it's his first time.

00:38:03.50,00:38:07.12
Dad, we have a plane.

00:38:08.92,00:38:11.25
Did you bring some things?

00:38:11.84,00:38:14.38
What's that, your gym bag?

00:38:14.55,00:38:17.97
- Goodbye.[br]- He's in your care.

00:38:38.20,00:38:41.66
- What do you pay for disposal?[br]- Today I'm paying 50.

00:38:41.99,00:38:43.20
Your offer?

00:38:43.37,00:38:45.66
We can halve your costs,

00:38:45.79,00:38:47.46
25 cents a kilo.

00:38:48.00,00:38:49.21
That's good,

00:38:49.75,00:38:52.50
but is it all "clean",[br]like they say in the United States?

00:38:52.63,00:38:54.09
Since it's toxic waste,

00:38:54.21,00:38:56.67
certification,[br]storage and transportation.

00:39:00.05,00:39:03.47
- Is there a contract to look over?[br]- Of course.

00:39:07.14,00:39:08.77
In case you're wondering,

00:39:09.10,00:39:10.85
the disposal cycle

00:39:10.98,00:39:13.36
goes to the disposal area[br]in Marcianise.

00:39:14.11,00:39:15.94
I'm telling you in fairness.

00:39:16.07,00:39:19.24
Thank you for the information,

00:39:19.36,00:39:21.82
but my only concern[br]is that it's "clean".

00:39:21.95,00:39:24.24
You can rest assured of that.

00:39:25.08,00:39:28.58
We can dispose of all the waste[br]that you produce in a year.

00:39:28.71,00:39:30.00
Eight hundred tons.

00:39:30.12,00:39:31.54
Exactly.

00:39:32.63,00:39:33.96
It's not a problem.

00:39:34.13,00:39:35.25
That's a lot.

00:39:39.84,00:39:41.43
My concern is disposal.

00:39:41.55,00:39:45.22
We serve various companies,[br]you can check.

00:39:45.64,00:39:48.39
I already have!

00:39:48.89,00:39:50.39
Don't worry.

00:39:52.19,00:39:55.06
As far as I can see,[br]there's maximum transparency.

00:39:55.19,00:39:56.44
Absolutely.

00:39:59.28,00:40:02.74
- The warehouses at Teverola?[br]- We use them for tires.

00:40:02.87,00:40:04.07
Exactly.

00:40:04.53,00:40:06.87
Will we put the tannery waste[br]in the quarry?

00:40:06.99,00:40:09.62
- Don't talk foolishness.[br]- Where then?

00:40:10.16,00:40:11.96
Check the European catalogue.

00:40:15.09,00:40:17.13
Here they are, 04.

00:40:17.55,00:40:20.30
The ones in red,[br]are among the most dangerous.

00:40:20.63,00:40:24.30
"Exhausted degreasing baths[br]with solvents, no liquid phase."

00:40:24.47,00:40:25.93
No, no good.

00:40:28.47,00:40:29.89
Then 4-11:

00:40:30.48,00:40:33.48
"Waste containing halogenated[br]compounds from operations"

00:40:33.60,00:40:35.65
"of manufacturing and finishing."

00:40:35.77,00:40:37.02
These are good.

00:40:37.36,00:40:40.57
It's stuff the earth absorbs,[br]we'll mix it with compost.

00:40:41.61,00:40:43.66
Fertilizer!

00:40:45.74,00:40:48.41
All that leaves is[br]Milan's sweeping refuse,

00:40:48.54,00:40:49.99
that's 60 trucks.

00:40:52.21,00:40:54.79
- The quarries at San Felice?[br]- They're too small.

00:40:55.33,00:40:57.84
I don't think so, look.

00:40:57.96,00:40:59.13
Let me see.

00:41:05.97,00:41:08.97
They're too small[br]and they're shallow,

00:41:09.43,00:41:10.60
they're no good.

00:41:22.95,00:41:25.78
Yes... I've got[br]ten contracts out of ten.

00:41:30.49,00:41:31.83
Is he near you?

00:41:34.54,00:41:35.83
Put him on.

00:41:36.67,00:41:38.17
I'll talk to him.

00:42:01.40,00:42:04.32
I told him, everything's okay.

00:42:17.88,00:42:20.71
- Do you like traveling?[br]- Sure!

00:42:21.46,00:42:22.88
We'll take more trips.

00:42:32.77,00:42:34.93
Everyone here works in boats?

00:42:35.27,00:42:38.14
Everyone, firemen, ambulances...

00:42:39.73,00:42:43.11
- Funerals.[br]- I've already seen two.

00:42:43.69,00:42:45.49
Even the dead go by boat!

00:43:09.43,00:43:12.35
Wow, they've got so many!

00:43:16.77,00:43:17.89
Steady me.

00:44:10.49,00:44:11.95
There's nothing here.

00:44:27.67,00:44:28.80
Nothing?

00:44:29.51,00:44:30.67
Are you sure?

00:44:57.87,00:44:58.99
Oh God!

00:44:59.37,00:45:00.95
Look what's here!

00:45:08.88,00:45:10.42
See? It's like you said!

00:45:14.13,00:45:15.34
Look here!

00:45:16.30,00:45:17.85
A Beretta 93!

00:45:17.97,00:45:19.56
A Kalashnikov!

00:45:20.56,00:45:23.35
See if they're loaded.

00:45:23.48,00:45:25.48
- Check.[br]- It's unloaded.

00:45:41.20,00:45:42.66
Look, an M12!

00:45:43.87,00:45:45.29
This is the 921.

00:45:45.42,00:45:46.79
That bearded bum!

00:45:47.67,00:45:50.50
We'll see how[br]he blows my head off!

00:45:51.05,00:45:54.55
Enough for Casale di Principe![br]Everybody!

00:45:55.38,00:45:57.59
Won't blow my head off now, eh?

00:46:02.39,00:46:03.72
Should I put two in?

00:46:06.35,00:46:07.94
And Nikita's?

00:46:08.19,00:46:09.15
And the 38?

00:46:26.96,00:46:30.63
- Want to see how I can shoot?[br]- Show me!

00:46:31.55,00:46:32.92
Show me!

00:46:34.42,00:46:36.55
Aim there!

00:47:12.46,00:47:14.17
I hit it!

00:47:30.40,00:47:32.90
We'll blow[br]the Colombians' heads off!

00:47:41.62,00:47:43.12
That's good.

00:47:47.75,00:47:48.91
Everything okay?

00:47:54.71,00:47:56.59
With love and feeling.

00:48:09.89,00:48:12.27
- What is it?[br]- Your wife's on the phone.

00:48:12.44,00:48:13.98
Tell her not to wait up.

00:48:14.11,00:48:17.90
Don't get tired out, need anything?

00:48:18.03,00:48:19.24
No, thanks.

00:48:19.86,00:48:21.65
- You'll lock up?[br]- Yes.

00:48:21.78,00:48:23.78
Goodnight.

00:48:48.22,00:48:49.39
Xian?

00:49:25.26,00:49:27.09
I have been waiting for you.

00:49:28.93,00:49:32.14
- I got lost.[br]- I am happy you came.

00:49:45.82,00:49:47.49
Please sit down.

00:49:50.45,00:49:53.04
We are cooking fish.

00:50:03.88,00:50:05.80
I've already eaten.

00:50:06.01,00:50:08.55
Try a typical Chinese dish.

00:50:08.68,00:50:09.72
Okay?

00:50:16.85,00:50:19.02
Just cooked, it is good.

00:50:19.27,00:50:20.94
Meat with bell peppers.

00:50:21.07,00:50:22.69
I've already eaten.

00:50:26.86,00:50:28.28
Taste.

00:50:28.49,00:50:30.49
We use chopsticks.

00:50:30.62,00:50:32.87
- I don't know how to use them.[br]- Try!

00:50:36.29,00:50:37.58
I am pleased,

00:50:38.21,00:50:40.58
we have a little toast.

00:50:41.96,00:50:44.05
We go to the factory.

00:50:52.35,00:50:53.35
Why not?

00:50:58.48,00:51:00.31
I put a pillow in here.

00:51:00.44,00:51:01.98
It's dangerous.

00:51:03.53,00:51:07.49
I already told you,[br]no one can know, just us.

00:51:07.78,00:51:09.95
It's better for both of us.

00:51:10.07,00:51:13.87
- Won't I need air?[br]- No, there's an opening.

00:51:13.99,00:51:19.29
I'll open the front window,[br]so air will come in.

00:51:21.00,00:51:22.29
Forgive me.

00:51:25.01,00:51:26.42
Are we sure?

00:51:28.72,00:51:32.18
It is best for both of us,[br]because it is dangerous.

00:51:35.06,00:51:37.18
- Does air come through here?[br]- Yes.

00:51:37.98,00:51:40.44
And I'll open the window too.

00:52:45.04,00:52:47.92
Please, come in, Mr. Pasquale.

00:52:49.05,00:52:50.92
All are waiting for you.

00:52:54.05,00:52:55.84
All are very happy.

00:53:11.15,00:53:14.36
I told them who you are[br]and all are happy.

00:53:16.70,00:53:18.28
What a nice factory!

00:53:19.04,00:53:20.87
More than 80 people.

00:54:04.96,00:54:06.42
I'm moved.

00:54:11.21,00:54:12.88
What can I say?

00:54:14.51,00:54:16.72
To do this work

00:54:17.89,00:54:19.80
you need lots of patience...

00:54:26.02,00:54:27.35
...and lots of love.

00:54:34.28,00:54:35.94
For the first lesson...

00:54:39.03,00:54:41.99
...l'll cut out a bodice.

00:54:48.96,00:54:50.63
Let's begin.

00:55:02.06,00:55:05.39
You must place patterns carefully.

00:55:12.27,00:55:13.98
Spread the cloth well...

00:55:37.67,00:55:39.22
Maria, are you asleep?

00:55:44.72,00:55:46.60
Where have I been, in China?

00:55:50.02,00:55:52.56
They were all bowing to me.

00:55:54.52,00:55:55.65
Master!

00:55:56.53,00:55:58.24
They called me "master"!

00:56:04.28,00:56:07.29
- Did you know the Chinese can cook?[br]- The Chinese?

00:56:07.75,00:56:09.20
Darn right!

00:56:10.46,00:56:12.67
They cooked a delicious bass!

00:56:16.75,00:56:18.51
There were boxes everywhere

00:56:18.63,00:56:20.67
and they put me in the trunk!

00:56:22.64,00:56:24.43
Both coming and going.

00:56:28.18,00:56:29.68
I need some sleep.

00:56:31.06,00:56:32.64
Here.

00:56:35.86,00:56:38.28
I have to sleep a fow hours.

00:56:42.03,00:56:43.66
What's this money?

00:56:55.96,00:56:57.54
Where did you get it?

00:56:58.21,00:56:59.84
I have to sleep.

00:57:01.34,00:57:03.97
Help me understand.

00:57:04.93,00:57:06.89
I talked to my son this morning,

00:57:07.64,00:57:12.14
he said: "Mom I'm leaving,[br]I'm going to be a secessionist."

00:57:13.90,00:57:15.02
Really?

00:57:19.57,00:57:20.98
What did you say?

00:57:22.11,00:57:23.70
He's convinced,

00:57:24.78,00:57:26.78
he said: "We're great,"

00:57:26.99,00:57:30.04
"we'll win the war,[br]the others are nobodies."

00:57:30.50,00:57:34.33
War? A bunch of morons[br]warring against us?

00:57:35.25,00:57:36.79
You have to stop him.

00:57:39.00,00:57:40.75
This side is the right side.

00:57:42.22,00:57:44.13
Have you seen what's happening?

00:57:45.26,00:57:47.09
There are killings every day.

00:57:48.72,00:57:51.81
Don't say anything to anybody,[br]not even your husband.

00:57:53.48,00:57:54.89
Who'd ever tell him!

00:57:57.40,00:58:01.07
When he gets out, what'll he do?[br]Father and son will kill each other?

00:58:01.19,00:58:03.82
No, because your son[br]will stay right here.

00:58:05.86,00:58:07.78
They'll all come to a bad end.

00:58:12.66,00:58:14.58
Do you feel so sure about that?

00:58:15.00,00:58:16.16
I don't.

00:58:17.42,00:58:18.67
I do.

00:59:11.80,00:59:13.89
When will we see each other again?

00:59:14.10,00:59:15.64
When you change sides.

00:59:16.14,00:59:18.23
Want to stay faithful? Go ahead!

00:59:18.90,00:59:21.31
You go your way and I go another.

00:59:21.81,00:59:24.94
But we can still have[br]a pizza together with friends.

00:59:25.74,00:59:27.19
I'm telling you again,

00:59:27.86,00:59:29.45
friend, enemy.

00:59:32.91,00:59:35.62
We've known each other for so long,[br]why go with them?

00:59:35.75,00:59:38.83
Remember when we were brothers?[br]Now we're enemies.

00:59:42.04,00:59:45.59
I'm telling you, if you don't[br]change sides, we might kill you

00:59:45.71,00:59:48.22
or you might kill us.

00:59:49.13,00:59:51.72
Because we're at war,

00:59:51.93,00:59:53.89
people are dying every day.

00:59:59.77,01:00:02.44
- You could have stayed with us...[br]- What for?

01:00:02.56,01:00:04.52
I'm best on the other side.

01:00:17.75,01:00:18.83
Bye, Simone.

01:01:26.69,01:01:28.11
Want a little Sambuca?

01:01:33.99,01:01:36.07
You'll be right off, don't worry.

01:01:36.82,01:01:38.16
Takes time.

01:01:56.22,01:01:58.35
Careful when you go out.

01:01:58.47,01:01:59.51
Thank you.

01:03:32.52,01:03:33.90
Gaetano, show him.

01:03:35.28,01:03:37.15
- It's big.[br]- You're right.

01:03:37.28,01:03:39.20
- Enzo![br]- What?

01:03:39.53,01:03:41.78
Do I have to tell you?

01:03:44.99,01:03:46.45
It's awesome.

01:03:47.54,01:03:48.71
I like it.

01:03:48.83,01:03:49.96
Like it?

01:03:50.50,01:03:52.79
You look great.

01:03:52.92,01:03:54.38
Tot?, show it off.

01:03:56.71,01:03:58.17
It's really nice.

01:04:08.73,01:04:10.89
- How many so far?[br]- 45 doses.

01:04:11.31,01:04:12.35
Okay.

01:04:14.69,01:04:15.94
It's good stuff.

01:04:30.21,01:04:31.37
How many so far?

01:04:32.92,01:04:35.92
Fifty-two,[br]plus four that guy's still got.

01:04:37.67,01:04:39.05
- Understand?[br]- Yeah.

01:04:46.18,01:04:47.97
I'll get back to you later.

01:04:51.31,01:04:54.69
- How many?[br]- Fifty-two and that guy's got four.

01:04:54.81,01:04:56.65
Then we'll total it.

01:05:03.03,01:05:04.28
Hello!

01:05:06.95,01:05:08.45
Nice, eh?

01:05:09.45,01:05:10.95
Hi, gorgeous!

01:05:12.29,01:05:13.79
- Girls![br]- Beautiful!

01:05:14.25,01:05:15.58
Alessia?

01:05:20.09,01:05:23.30
What are you doing here?[br]Get out.

01:05:24.51,01:05:27.30
I don't want to see you around here.

01:05:28.85,01:05:31.60
We have to go crying[br]at the prison gates?

01:05:31.89,01:05:35.06
What I went through with your father[br]was enough for me.

01:07:39.19,01:07:40.48
Good morning, Jacob.

01:07:40.60,01:07:42.61
- Are you alright?[br]- Fine, thanks, and you?

01:07:42.73,01:07:45.02
Have a good trip?

01:07:46.28,01:07:48.99
A very nice trip.

01:07:50.20,01:07:53.12
- Do you have documents?[br]- It's humanitarian aid.

01:07:53.24,01:07:55.16
Yes, it's humanitarian aid.

01:07:56.25,01:07:58.87
- Everything okay?[br]- Yes.

01:08:01.33,01:08:05.17
They've already called an ambulance.

01:08:07.05,01:08:09.34
Get back to work!

01:08:09.59,01:08:11.76
Go back to work!

01:08:14.39,01:08:15.72
What happened?

01:08:18.10,01:08:20.94
As they were dumping,

01:08:21.19,01:08:25.15
two drums opened[br]and spilled on a truck driver.

01:08:25.27,01:08:27.44
- Have you already called Zio?[br]- No!

01:08:27.57,01:08:31.07
- They wanted to call an ambulance![br]- I'll take care of this.

01:08:34.49,01:08:36.99
Pay the truckers[br]and tell them to fuck off.

01:08:37.20,01:08:41.87
- Who'll drive the trucks?[br]- Don't the blacks know how?

01:08:42.00,01:08:43.71
Can you drive?

01:08:44.00,01:08:46.13
They can't even ride bikes!

01:08:48.76,01:08:50.38
I'll handle this.

01:08:51.13,01:08:54.18
Don't let them touch the trucks,[br]they're ours.

01:08:56.18,01:08:57.47
Roberto, wait here.

01:08:58.27,01:08:59.64
Calm down!

01:09:05.40,01:09:10.94
You made a mistake, you had us doing[br]a job we shouldn't have!

01:09:11.11,01:09:14.70
It just happened!

01:10:01.50,01:10:03.41
- I'm taking the red one.[br]- No, that's mine!

01:10:11.92,01:10:14.84
- Take that one.[br]- I'll take this one!

01:10:20.60,01:10:23.06
- I'm not tall enough![br]- Climb up there!

01:10:28.02,01:10:30.90
Wake up, get some cushions!

01:10:36.32,01:10:38.99
- The keys?[br]- Look under the seat!

01:10:43.70,01:10:46.16
Come on! Are you sleeping?

01:10:46.96,01:10:49.00
Can't you see there's work to do?

01:10:49.29,01:10:50.88
Put this under your butt!

01:10:52.88,01:10:54.51
Put it under your butt.

01:10:54.92,01:10:57.34
Go slowly[br]and drive the truck down there.

01:10:58.43,01:11:00.72
Then I'll pay you.

01:11:05.14,01:11:06.48
Catch this cushion.

01:11:10.31,01:11:11.52
Come on!

01:11:15.49,01:11:17.61
Go slow!

01:11:20.07,01:11:23.33
Move forward[br]and make space for that one!

01:11:23.66,01:11:25.66
Roberto, tell him what to do!

01:11:25.79,01:11:27.58
All the way down there!

01:13:20.65,01:13:22.70
- What is it?[br]- It's the new list.

01:13:24.20,01:13:26.20
Have you already paid[br]the Mellone family?

01:13:26.83,01:13:28.53
And the redhead's family too?

01:13:29.08,01:13:30.04
Of course.

01:13:30.16,01:13:31.50
Wasted money.

01:13:33.00,01:13:35.17
Let's make not make[br]these mistakes anymore.

01:13:35.29,01:13:36.83
Are these the only ones?

01:13:38.92,01:13:40.92
More money and less work.

01:13:41.84,01:13:43.22
But more risk.

01:13:43.76,01:13:46.09
What risk?

01:13:47.10,01:13:49.14
Just don't go into certain areas,

01:13:49.31,01:13:52.35
the Seven Buildings, the Smurf Houses[br]and the Blue Houses.

01:13:52.52,01:13:54.69
As for the rest,[br]you can go anywhere.

01:13:55.40,01:13:58.23
Maria's not here,[br]I already paid her.

01:14:00.98,01:14:04.15
- Isn't her husband with us?[br]- Yes, but her son betrayed.

01:14:04.28,01:14:05.74
They mustn't get a cent.

01:14:09.45,01:14:12.70
These things are none of your affair,[br]respect the list.

01:14:32.93,01:14:34.10
Who is it?

01:14:46.41,01:14:47.49
What is it?

01:14:47.61,01:14:49.70
- Not letting me in?[br]- Tell me.

01:14:51.70,01:14:52.87
No one's home.

01:14:53.37,01:14:54.50
The week's pay.

01:14:54.62,01:14:57.62
- Sure, but no one's home.[br]- I'll leave it with you.

01:14:58.42,01:15:00.54
Just a minute and I'll let you in.

01:15:11.60,01:15:13.43
- Are you alone?[br]- Yes.

01:15:13.56,01:15:15.93
- You came by yourself?[br]- I'm alone!

01:15:18.06,01:15:19.10
I'm alone.

01:15:19.23,01:15:22.40
You can give this pittance[br]to your cronies, hear me?

01:15:25.49,01:15:28.03
Where's the list?

01:15:29.49,01:15:32.41
Don't move![br]Put your hands on the floor.

01:15:34.16,01:15:37.29
You put our names[br]together with your cronies'?

01:15:37.41,01:15:38.58
Motherfucker!

01:15:38.96,01:15:41.29
We hate those people.

01:15:41.42,01:15:44.13
Tell your friends that we'll come[br]get them in their homes

01:15:44.25,01:15:47.97
and we'll shoot them[br]in the head like you!

01:15:49.72,01:15:51.84
- How did you get here?[br]- On my motorbike.

01:15:51.97,01:15:54.89
- Now I'll shoot him.[br]- Not in here.

01:15:55.52,01:15:57.06
Go get your bike.

01:15:58.52,01:16:00.69
Is anyone here?

01:16:00.90,01:16:02.48
Leave now!

01:16:54.49,01:16:56.12
Don Ciro!

01:16:57.62,01:16:59.25
What an idiot.

01:17:03.46,01:17:08.96
Don Ciro![br]Where in hell are you going?

01:17:09.42,01:17:10.84
He's nuts.

01:17:14.59,01:17:17.43
You're acting like a skittish horse,

01:17:18.01,01:17:19.77
where are you running to?

01:17:19.89,01:17:22.48
You made me take the steps[br]four at a time.

01:17:22.77,01:17:24.73
What can we do with you?

01:17:25.27,01:17:27.11
Why are you running?

01:17:27.52,01:17:30.32
A wild horse is what you seem.

01:17:32.36,01:17:34.20
When will we talk a little?

01:17:36.37,01:17:38.16
Not even answering?

01:17:39.41,01:17:42.00
I've got to see[br]what to do with this guy,

01:17:42.29,01:17:43.87
I have to blast him.

01:17:44.00,01:17:47.33
What did you give me?[br]The same money again?

01:17:47.59,01:17:49.59
Is this guy an idiot?

01:17:49.88,01:17:53.72
Or are they making him[br]be an asshole?

01:17:54.13,01:17:57.39
Waiting for me to lose my head?

01:17:58.14,01:17:59.60
What can I do?

01:18:06.86,01:18:08.27
Let's do a stick-up?

01:18:09.15,01:18:10.57
A stick-up.

01:18:10.86,01:18:12.53
- What?[br]- A stick-up.

01:18:13.03,01:18:16.99
- No way![br]- Let's do it!

01:18:17.12,01:18:21.49
- Stick-up a video games room?[br]- Our money's run out.

01:18:22.45,01:18:25.46
- What can this place have?[br]- Money!

01:18:26.25,01:18:28.50
Listen to me for once.

01:18:29.09,01:18:31.75
Cut the bullshit!

01:18:32.42,01:18:35.09
- A hold-up, no way![br]- Listen to me.

01:18:35.22,01:18:38.30
Let's play one more euro and go home.

01:18:38.72,01:18:41.18
We're out of money!

01:18:43.56,01:18:46.23
They must have about 50 cents.

01:18:46.35,01:18:47.85
Do we do it or not?

01:18:49.19,01:18:51.90
You get that one and[br]I'll take these guys down.

01:18:53.07,01:18:56.11
- See all the people.[br]- It'll work!

01:18:57.07,01:18:58.57
Something fast.

01:19:04.45,01:19:05.54
Are you ready?

01:19:07.37,01:19:08.67
Yes or no?

01:19:12.17,01:19:13.92
This is a hold-up!

01:19:15.26,01:19:17.55
On the floor!

01:19:20.51,01:19:22.56
Get out of there!

01:21:12.17,01:21:14.50
- She's hot![br]- She sucks.

01:21:15.13,01:21:16.50
What!

01:21:18.17,01:21:21.42
- You like her?[br]- What's not to like!

01:21:22.18,01:21:24.18
You like one thing,[br]I like another.

01:21:28.10,01:21:29.14
Right now!

01:21:33.02,01:21:36.11
- The blonde in the side room?[br]- Yeah.

01:21:36.48,01:21:37.56
Hillary?

01:21:49.29,01:21:50.45
Right away!

01:21:52.16,01:21:53.71
I can't even stand still.

01:21:53.83,01:21:55.33
I'll let you back in later.

01:22:01.55,01:22:03.34
- What's your name?[br]- Kristal.

01:22:06.22,01:22:08.89
- What do you want to do?[br]- Everything.

01:22:10.35,01:22:14.06
Have you ever stripped a girl?[br]I'll teach you.

01:22:14.19,01:22:16.65
- You're the first.[br]- You go really slow.

01:22:18.52,01:22:23.03
- I'm too horny.[br]- Sure, but you have to go slow.

01:22:27.82,01:22:29.87
You have to strip right away.

01:22:38.13,01:22:39.46
What do we do?

01:22:43.92,01:22:45.34
Want to have sex?

01:22:45.93,01:22:47.43
Wait!

01:22:48.51,01:22:49.72
Such a hurry!

01:23:05.74,01:23:06.90
Did I hurt you?

01:23:07.66,01:23:11.37
- Why not?[br]- Don't bite, it hurts.

01:23:16.62,01:23:19.00
Hey, zip up!

01:23:19.38,01:23:20.88
Zip up!

01:23:21.34,01:23:24.30
- Look, I'll call...[br]- Call who you want.

01:23:24.42,01:23:25.55
Zip up!

01:23:25.84,01:23:26.84
Come here!

01:23:26.97,01:23:29.51
- Now![br]- You do it.

01:23:31.51,01:23:34.52
- Like this?[br]- It's not allowed.

01:23:34.97,01:23:36.64
Or I'll leave.

01:23:37.27,01:23:39.52
Come here, I zipped.

01:23:41.15,01:23:42.44
I'm gonna hurt you.

01:23:42.82,01:23:45.98
No, I'm doing the hurting to you.

01:23:46.11,01:23:48.49
- Really?[br]- What do you think?

01:24:08.30,01:24:11.64
Don't do anything to me!

01:24:18.69,01:24:22.77
Where are the weapons?

01:24:31.53,01:24:35.03
I'll give you one day[br]to put them back!

01:24:35.37,01:24:38.29
Get the message?

01:24:40.33,01:24:43.88
- Do I shoot them in the head?[br]- Let them live a little more.

01:24:44.00,01:24:46.92
Get back in the car.

01:24:49.05,01:24:50.22
Get the message?

01:25:01.64,01:25:03.69
Sweet Pea, get up!

01:25:06.77,01:25:10.07
Don't be scared, I'm here,[br]we're at war!

01:25:10.20,01:25:11.65
Get lost!

01:25:11.78,01:25:13.45
Get up!

01:25:19.66,01:25:21.37
Enough!

01:25:21.58,01:25:23.29
Come here, don't worry!

01:25:23.71,01:25:27.09
- I'm getting out of here.[br]- No!

01:25:27.21,01:25:29.34
We'll beat these guys!

01:25:29.67,01:25:31.55
Listen to me!

01:25:51.40,01:25:53.99
You're making me waste time,

01:25:54.99,01:25:57.66
you said you made a mark,[br]but where is it?

01:25:57.78,01:25:59.58
Oh, what is it?

01:26:04.54,01:26:08.75
- Remember I made a mark![br]- Yeah, but you can't find it!

01:26:11.80,01:26:13.84
You're as dumb as they come.

01:26:28.15,01:26:30.15
Took you half an hour!

01:26:30.28,01:26:32.03
Let's move, I have to shoot,

01:26:32.36,01:26:35.28
I can't stand not shooting!

01:26:35.49,01:26:37.49
- Want to shoot?[br]- Right away!

01:26:39.78,01:26:42.70
- Did you load it?[br]- You'd better shut up.

01:26:42.83,01:26:44.71
Sweet Pea, do like I tell you.

01:26:46.67,01:26:49.08
I don't give a fuck what you think.

01:26:49.29,01:26:52.88
We break everyone's balls,[br]but who've we killed?

01:26:53.01,01:26:54.97
Do like I say and get moving!

01:26:55.09,01:26:56.17
Move!

01:26:56.55,01:27:01.31
Where are we going?

01:27:01.60,01:27:03.27
Do I have to beat you up?

01:27:03.39,01:27:07.56
Do we have to war with each other?

01:27:08.02,01:27:11.61
I'm not warring with you,[br]all we have to do is shoot!

01:27:11.90,01:27:15.28
- We're going to shoot alone?[br]- Yeah, just you and me!

01:27:15.40,01:27:18.57
- Not thinking about later?[br]- I don't want to think a thing!

01:27:18.70,01:27:23.70
Want to take the wrong steps,[br]we'll never grow that way.

01:27:23.83,01:27:26.12
Listening to you, we'll die sooner.

01:27:26.87,01:27:28.67
Can I say something?

01:27:30.88,01:27:34.55
Those kids don't know how to behave,[br]they're just raising Cain.

01:27:35.13,01:27:37.38
- Why?[br]- They didn't give the weapons back.

01:27:37.51,01:27:39.22
They don't want to listen.

01:27:39.64,01:27:42.05
I'll make them listen my way.

01:27:45.48,01:27:47.64
I'll take these guys and kill them.

01:27:50.81,01:27:52.86
If you kill two kids,

01:27:52.98,01:27:55.40
what shits will we look like[br]in the territory

01:27:55.53,01:27:58.61
when people find out?

01:27:58.95,01:28:00.82
Are we joking?

01:28:02.58,01:28:07.00
Then the cops come,[br]we have to lay low for a month

01:28:07.25,01:28:09.83
and all the traffic ends.

01:28:13.13,01:28:17.01
Zio Vittorio, they can't be[br]lording it around in my area,

01:28:17.13,01:28:20.97
they've already done so much,[br]I've warned them more than once.

01:28:21.09,01:28:23.14
I can't consider them kids anymore.

01:28:24.18,01:28:26.10
They have to die, that's final!

01:28:26.97,01:28:30.31
You're right,[br]but first let's tell the families.

01:28:30.44,01:28:32.48
I don't know who they are.

01:28:34.69,01:28:36.57
Will you take care of it?

01:28:37.82,01:28:40.82
I'll handle it!

01:29:08.52,01:29:09.77
Tot?, is that you?

01:29:16.65,01:29:19.44
- What happened to Silvana?[br]- In the storeroom.

01:29:36.50,01:29:38.09
How come it's so dark?

01:29:39.05,01:29:40.63
Why are you in the dark?

01:29:40.76,01:29:42.42
It's okay like this.

01:29:43.93,01:29:45.64
Your change.

01:29:47.81,01:29:50.64
- The bread?[br]- There wasn't any.

01:29:50.93,01:29:53.73
- What'll we eat?[br]- There's pasta.

01:29:56.86,01:29:58.94
- Take your change.[br]- It's for you.

01:30:08.53,01:30:12.54
Why did you put her[br]in the storeroom?

01:30:13.21,01:30:14.83
She's fine where she is.

01:30:16.13,01:30:18.08
She's just an animal!

01:31:32.83,01:31:35.83
Come here a minute,[br]I have to talk to you.

01:31:36.83,01:31:39.08
Don't come out, it's dangerous.

01:31:39.50,01:31:41.33
Come on, no one can see you.

01:31:45.21,01:31:47.05
What are you doing, you're going?

01:31:50.97,01:31:52.22
Listen to me!

01:31:53.18,01:31:54.89
They said I have to leave.

01:31:56.10,01:31:57.68
I have to leave my house.

01:31:58.85,01:32:00.27
I can't do anything.

01:32:00.56,01:32:01.81
I'm not leaving!

01:32:04.19,01:32:05.57
Come here a minute!

01:32:12.41,01:32:15.95
Tell those friends of yours[br]I'm not leaving!

01:32:17.41,01:32:19.66
Tell those nice people!

01:32:19.83,01:32:23.34
I won't betray my son[br]and I'm not moving from here!

01:32:25.80,01:32:27.38
Not coming in for coffee?

01:32:27.51,01:32:29.42
Run off, run away!

01:33:10.63,01:33:12.05
Hello, accountant.

01:33:12.93,01:33:14.18
Please come in.

01:33:15.55,01:33:18.43
Why this sudden call?

01:33:18.68,01:33:20.06
You're worrying me.

01:33:20.18,01:33:22.64
The designers pay me after 60 days,

01:33:22.77,01:33:25.31
I have a little money,

01:33:25.61,01:33:27.48
but this wasn't the agreement.

01:33:28.44,01:33:30.19
Money isn't the problem.

01:33:32.03,01:33:33.15
What is it then?

01:33:33.78,01:33:35.87
It seems

01:33:36.87,01:33:39.04
the problem is in your own house.

01:33:40.45,01:33:41.96
In my house?

01:33:42.50,01:33:44.00
What problem is it?

01:33:45.71,01:33:47.50
One of your associates,

01:33:48.92,01:33:50.55
Pasquale Del Prete,

01:33:50.67,01:33:52.47
has sold out to the Chinese.

01:34:03.19,01:34:04.39
We're done.

01:34:08.86,01:34:10.40
The finishing touches...

01:34:19.54,01:34:20.99
I never doubted.

01:34:41.97,01:34:43.14
Everything okay?

01:34:46.60,01:34:49.77
Remember the first time[br]I put you to work in the factory?

01:34:50.23,01:34:51.73
You were just a kid.

01:34:54.53,01:34:55.74
Right.

01:35:05.79,01:35:07.75
- Everything alright?[br]- Yes.

01:35:20.81,01:35:22.56
Pasquale Del Prete.

01:35:32.40,01:35:35.82
Tell him to go slower, not too fast.

01:35:50.21,01:35:51.46
Well done, Giulia.

01:35:52.25,01:35:53.42
She's good.

01:36:25.79,01:36:27.75
In the morning I do Tai Chi.

01:36:28.25,01:36:29.25
Really?

01:36:29.37,01:36:32.54
- It's nice.[br]- It is good for your health.

01:36:32.96,01:36:34.92
It is like in China.

01:36:35.05,01:36:40.88
When you go to the park[br]in the morning, it is full of people,

01:36:41.43,01:36:44.14
old people too.

01:36:44.26,01:36:45.76
All doing Tai Chi.

01:36:46.06,01:36:48.52
Everyone

01:36:48.85,01:36:51.39
likes the culture of Tai Chi.

01:36:51.56,01:36:56.77
It's a tradition of Chinese culture.

01:36:56.90,01:36:58.99
When will you do egg rolls for me?

01:37:55.96,01:37:57.46
Wait up.

01:37:59.59,01:38:03.93
I spoke to the doctors,[br]you'll soon be released.

01:38:10.10,01:38:11.56
Damn you,

01:38:12.48,01:38:14.27
you really goofed up.

01:38:16.65,01:38:20.40
They loved the models,[br]they've asked for more...

01:38:20.53,01:38:22.03
You knew everything.

01:38:22.40,01:38:24.36
That's how I saved your life.

01:38:25.95,01:38:28.95
Those people don't kid around.

01:38:29.12,01:38:30.74
Leave me alone.

01:38:30.87,01:38:34.75
You should thank me,[br]those guys will kill you.

01:38:35.21,01:38:37.71
You and I pulled through.

01:38:37.84,01:38:40.59
- Find another tailor.[br]- Why do you say that?

01:38:40.71,01:38:44.22
- I want to be alone.[br]- How can I do this without you?

01:38:44.47,01:38:45.80
I really don't care.

01:38:45.93,01:38:50.22
- After all I've done for you.[br]- What have you done for me?

01:38:50.35,01:38:53.89
I took you off the streets,[br]I fed you for years.

01:38:54.02,01:38:57.73
- You've used me since I was a kid.[br]- Don't say that!

01:38:59.02,01:39:03.11
When you're better,[br]come see me, I'll give you a raise.

01:39:04.99,01:39:08.78
Rosa, give me that bike,[br]I have to go.

01:40:37.75,01:40:39.04
No admittance here,

01:40:39.16,01:40:40.58
that's it.

01:40:56.64,01:40:58.22
Want to give up?

01:40:58.85,01:41:01.06
Are we meat for the slaughter house?

01:41:10.07,01:41:12.28
Let's shoot,[br]we'll rack up corpses too.

01:41:12.41,01:41:13.53
Corpses?

01:41:14.95,01:41:18.33
- I'm not moving without orders.[br]- What orders?

01:41:19.04,01:41:21.46
We don't know how to move.

01:41:23.21,01:41:24.71
We don't know anything.

01:41:28.71,01:41:30.55
Do we have to keep taking it?

01:41:30.88,01:41:35.22
Do we have to wait for orders?

01:41:36.97,01:41:38.43
Let's rack up corpses.

01:41:38.81,01:41:42.52
What are we waiting for,[br]to be put down one by one?

01:41:46.86,01:41:49.19
If we don't move,[br]nothing will change.

01:41:49.32,01:41:51.74
No use feeling depressed.

01:41:53.36,01:41:55.95
We all have to be convinced.

01:41:56.07,01:41:58.70
But without orders,[br]I'm not moving.

01:42:01.12,01:42:02.79
This is open war,

01:42:02.96,01:42:04.87
you mustn't think about anyone.

01:42:05.67,01:42:08.25
- Who do we kill?[br]- Let's begin in our area.

01:42:10.42,01:42:12.26
From our own stronghold.

01:42:12.38,01:42:15.22
We don't know who's with us[br]and who's against us,

01:42:15.34,01:42:17.97
who do we make pay?

01:42:18.14,01:42:20.89
Where do you think[br]the order to kill came from?

01:42:21.68,01:42:23.14
Think!

01:42:24.35,01:42:26.77
Where did it come from?

01:42:27.19,01:42:29.77
- From there of course.[br]- From our own area.

01:42:29.94,01:42:31.69
She betrayed us.

01:42:31.82,01:42:34.20
We don't touch women.

01:42:34.32,01:42:36.78
Don't yell!

01:42:37.12,01:42:38.62
What are you saying?

01:42:42.87,01:42:47.00
Don't take it out on someone[br]no part of this, but the son.

01:42:47.25,01:42:50.29
- How do we find him?[br]- His mother's in our district.

01:42:50.50,01:42:52.76
It was her son who killed Gaetano.

01:42:53.05,01:42:55.05
Let's think what we'll do.

01:42:56.09,01:42:57.64
We could use the kid.

01:42:58.14,01:43:00.30
He's the only one[br]who can get to her.

01:43:02.47,01:43:03.98
He brings her shopping,

01:43:04.31,01:43:06.52
he's in good with the woman...

01:43:07.52,01:43:09.61
So, if we have to do it,

01:43:09.73,01:43:11.15
we'll need his help.

01:43:14.15,01:43:16.20
Tot?, what do you think you'll do?

01:43:17.91,01:43:19.91
Are you with us or against us?

01:43:26.50,01:43:27.75
What do you say?

01:43:30.50,01:43:32.25
Are you with us or not?

01:43:34.34,01:43:36.92
- We'll see what we can do.[br]- No, "we'll see".

01:43:37.05,01:43:39.47
Either you're with us[br]or you're against us,

01:43:40.47,01:43:41.93
one or the other.

01:43:42.60,01:43:46.48
If you're against us you can't leave,[br]we can't trust you.

01:43:46.81,01:43:49.98
It can't have been her.

01:43:50.11,01:43:51.94
This is our decision,

01:43:52.15,01:43:54.03
you have to be with us.

01:43:54.32,01:43:57.90
That's what we say,[br]you don't need to think.

01:44:02.58,01:44:04.16
What are you going to do?

01:44:05.66,01:44:08.91
- We'll see.[br]- I said no "we'll see".

01:44:25.14,01:44:26.47
Come on down.

01:44:26.89,01:44:28.77
I have to tell you something!

01:44:30.73,01:44:32.15
No, come down!

01:44:33.86,01:44:35.73
Hurry, I have to leave!

01:46:17.04,01:46:18.34
Sit down!

01:46:56.75,01:46:58.46
You've known me for years,

01:46:58.67,01:47:00.63
you know what I've always done.

01:47:02.96,01:47:04.30
I brought the money.

01:47:04.47,01:47:06.38
I brought it to your family, too.

01:47:09.01,01:47:11.89
I did it because I was ordered to.

01:47:16.35,01:47:17.90
War isn't for me.

01:47:18.98,01:47:21.90
But you're in it, know that?

01:47:23.82,01:47:25.24
Yes.

01:47:25.36,01:47:26.36
So?

01:47:27.61,01:47:28.57
You tell me.

01:47:28.70,01:47:30.07
What can I tell you?

01:47:34.62,01:47:36.37
What did you come here for?

01:47:39.04,01:47:40.29
To talk to you.

01:47:41.38,01:47:43.00
About what?

01:47:46.59,01:47:48.05
I want to save myself.

01:47:48.80,01:47:50.68
You'll have to buy your life,

01:47:51.64,01:47:53.56
I won't give it to you.

01:47:58.56,01:47:59.90
What I did there,

01:48:01.27,01:48:02.69
I can do for you here.

01:48:03.94,01:48:05.78
We don't need money-carriers,

01:48:06.49,01:48:09.61
we have to score,[br]kill people, and we need money.

01:48:10.82,01:48:12.45
You're wasting your time.

01:48:16.00,01:48:17.41
You're more dead than alive.

01:48:17.54,01:48:18.96
But we were brothers before.

01:48:19.08,01:48:22.00
Before!

01:48:22.42,01:48:24.92
Then they started[br]messing around with shit.

01:48:30.34,01:48:35.43
Our relatives were good people...[br]So they killed them!

01:48:37.64,01:48:39.10
So, don't come asking

01:48:39.23,01:48:40.89
to pass to the other side.

01:48:41.52,01:48:43.77
We have to score, kill,

01:48:44.23,01:48:45.65
and we need money.

01:48:46.94,01:48:48.24
If not, you die,

01:48:48.61,01:48:50.45
because you're part of the war.

01:48:51.16,01:48:52.91
You bring money and I kill people,

01:48:53.03,01:48:55.16
we're the same, you and me,[br]in this war.

01:48:57.58,01:48:59.58
- I understand.[br]- You understand.

01:49:10.93,01:49:12.64
Wait a moment.

01:49:44.04,01:49:45.29
Everything okay?

01:49:48.21,01:49:49.46
And you?

01:49:57.26,01:49:58.47
That's four.

01:50:10.11,01:50:13.15
Face on the table!

01:50:14.24,01:50:15.20
Done?

01:50:15.32,01:50:16.66
Let's go!

01:50:24.50,01:50:25.92
Come on out!

01:50:26.71,01:50:28.04
Lucky, eh?

01:51:54.80,01:51:57.34
That's poison.

01:51:58.59,01:51:59.76
What'd he say?

01:51:59.97,01:52:04.10
My father wants to say the dumping[br]you're doing on our land

01:52:04.64,01:52:06.31
isn't garbage.

01:52:06.81,01:52:08.06
It's poison.

01:52:08.98,01:52:10.27
It's not garbage?

01:52:12.23,01:52:13.98
You heard right.

01:52:14.36,01:52:15.90
Don't worry.

01:52:16.61,01:52:20.16
A year's gone by with this dumping?

01:52:21.53,01:52:25.08
So far,[br]all we've done is pay our debts.

01:52:25.54,01:52:26.79
Just barely.

01:52:27.12,01:52:31.08
- Euro.[br]- I understand, Don Raffaele.

01:52:33.96,01:52:36.59
Everything costs double in euro.

01:52:36.84,01:52:37.84
And so?

01:52:38.05,01:52:41.34
We need something more.

01:52:42.89,01:52:46.81
These are the prices,[br]explain it to your kids,

01:52:47.31,01:52:49.48
if I do it for you,[br]I have to do it for everyone.

01:52:49.60,01:52:51.23
Don't put me[br]in a difficult situation.

01:52:51.35,01:52:55.40
Okay, if you give us more,[br]everyone has to get more.

01:52:55.53,01:52:57.40
So, little can be done.

01:52:57.53,01:52:59.74
But, we barely make ends meet,

01:52:59.86,01:53:01.66
we can't go on like this.

01:53:02.78,01:53:04.24
We were thinking,

01:53:06.24,01:53:08.33
is it possible to do more dumping?

01:53:11.50,01:53:12.92
Euro...

01:53:13.67,01:53:15.04
More dumping?

01:53:15.92,01:53:19.21
We have another piece of land[br]for other dumping sites.

01:53:19.34,01:53:20.47
Near here?

01:53:21.63,01:53:22.97
Around here.

01:53:23.51,01:53:25.18
More dumping we do,

01:53:25.64,01:53:28.22
faster the ground gets filled.

01:53:28.39,01:53:31.89
You have another piece of land?

01:53:32.02,01:53:34.73
- Near here?[br]- Further on.

01:53:34.86,01:53:37.77
This other land[br]would be more convenient,

01:53:38.07,01:53:41.82
it's bigger and trucks[br]can get in easier.

01:53:42.36,01:53:43.66
But...

01:53:46.12,01:53:47.87
Still 100 euros per dumping.

01:53:48.33,01:53:50.08
What do you mean, 100 euros!

01:53:50.29,01:53:53.83
Don't speak out of turn.

01:53:53.96,01:53:55.92
- He can't increase![br]- Who said so?

01:53:56.04,01:53:59.21
We'll increase the trucks.

01:53:59.46,01:54:03.30
You have to increase[br]the price of each dumping.

01:54:03.47,01:54:05.05
Want to lose everything?

01:54:05.18,01:54:07.39
They have nowhere else to turn.

01:54:07.60,01:54:08.60
Excuse me.

01:54:08.93,01:54:10.18
Don't worry.

01:54:13.06,01:54:15.69
Alright, now we'll reach...

01:54:19.86,01:54:20.98
an agreement.

01:54:21.11,01:54:26.03
Give him a glass of water.

01:54:26.16,01:54:27.49
I'll do it, don't worry.

01:54:36.21,01:54:37.46
Luca!

01:54:45.18,01:54:47.84
You have to clean up this field!

01:54:48.26,01:54:49.35
I'm not Luca.

01:54:49.47,01:54:50.85
Do a little work.

01:54:52.23,01:54:53.73
My name's Roberto.

01:54:56.44,01:54:58.98
This field is such a mess.

01:54:59.86,01:55:01.44
All such a mess.

01:55:02.44,01:55:04.95
Ma'am, it's raining.

01:55:05.32,01:55:06.66
Should I stop?

01:55:07.28,01:55:08.62
Come out of there.

01:55:11.70,01:55:13.62
I'll take you inside.

01:55:13.75,01:55:15.66
I'll be right along.

01:55:16.75,01:55:18.42
They've made ditches here,

01:55:18.54,01:55:20.25
someone should come

01:55:21.13,01:55:22.96
to fill them.

01:55:25.01,01:55:26.26
Let's go!

01:55:50.66,01:55:52.74
What beautiful peaches, thank you!

01:55:54.04,01:55:55.45
I'll take them to the kids.

01:55:55.58,01:55:57.83
See how beautiful they are!

01:55:58.33,01:55:59.29
Let's go.

01:56:00.59,01:56:02.00
Put them in the car.

01:56:02.13,01:56:03.55
Come on!

01:56:17.44,01:56:18.60
Toss that stuff.

01:56:19.69,01:56:21.27
- What?[br]- The peaches.

01:56:21.40,01:56:23.48
Can't you smell how they stink?

01:56:45.59,01:56:46.84
Done?

01:57:04.86,01:57:05.98
What?

01:57:06.23,01:57:07.53
Listen,

01:57:08.53,01:57:10.49
I've been thinking.

01:57:11.66,01:57:13.91
Maybe I'm not cut out for this work.

01:57:14.20,01:57:15.53
What?

01:57:15.66,01:57:18.12
I mean it.

01:57:18.50,01:57:20.16
I'm not up to it.

01:57:21.58,01:57:23.33
We're doing so well!

01:57:24.92,01:57:26.04
No,

01:57:26.96,01:57:28.71
I don't want to work anymore,

01:57:29.26,01:57:30.38
I'm sorry.

01:57:36.35,01:57:38.89
Think this job sucks?

01:57:39.56,01:57:42.73
You know that guys like me[br]put this shit country in Europe?

01:57:44.27,01:57:47.77
Know how many workers I've helped[br]by saving their companies money?

01:57:47.90,01:57:49.82
Stop and look!

01:57:50.86,01:57:51.99
What do you see?

01:57:54.53,01:57:55.70
Debts.

01:57:56.45,01:57:59.49
All these people have been saved[br]only thanks to us.

01:58:01.79,01:58:03.67
I saw how you help them live.

01:58:04.58,01:58:07.38
You save a worker in Mestre[br]and kill a family in Mondragone.

01:58:07.50,01:58:10.13
That's how it works,[br]but I didn't decide it.

01:58:10.88,01:58:13.59
We solve problems created by others.

01:58:14.30,01:58:16.30
I didn't create[br]chromium and asbestos,

01:58:16.43,01:58:18.26
I didn't dig up the mountain.

01:58:18.39,01:58:21.06
That's how it works?

01:58:21.18,01:58:22.60
I don't work that way.

01:58:24.31,01:58:25.52
I'm not like you.

01:58:25.65,01:58:28.82
- What are you like?[br]- I'm different.

01:58:33.36,01:58:34.91
Go make pizzas!

01:58:35.82,01:58:37.16
He's different.

01:58:40.24,01:58:42.58
Don't think you're better than me!

01:58:43.87,01:58:45.62
I gave you a chance!

01:58:48.63,01:58:50.46
Go fuck yourself!

01:59:50.44,01:59:54.73
I think Scarlett Johansson's here!

01:59:54.90,01:59:56.61
Splendid, magnificent,

01:59:57.11,01:59:59.61
all dressed in white,

02:00:01.95,02:00:03.20
cream.

02:00:03.91,02:00:07.08
- In style with the film.[br]- Absolutely.

02:00:07.21,02:00:10.58
Right colors,[br]right choice of dress.

02:00:10.71,02:00:16.46
It would be nice to know[br]why it took so long to get ready...

02:00:17.38,02:00:20.51
Because it's chic

02:00:21.35,02:00:23.47
yet so sophisticated.

02:00:23.68,02:00:28.27
An apparent simplicity,[br]but in reality, very elaborate...

02:00:28.39,02:00:30.19
Allow me to say...

02:00:30.40,02:00:33.86
Maybe to be awaited as a true star.

02:00:34.11,02:00:37.53
She's a star, and so beautiful.

02:00:38.70,02:00:41.03
The photographers are going crazy.

02:00:43.03,02:00:44.45
And the people too...

02:01:52.81,02:01:55.15
May I sit at your table?

02:02:01.07,02:02:03.99
- Can I offer you a cigarette?[br]- We don't smoke.

02:02:06.24,02:02:08.66
Everyone here talks about you.

02:02:08.99,02:02:12.58
You kids have balls, I can use you.

02:02:12.96,02:02:16.00
Why don't you join my guys?

02:02:16.67,02:02:18.67
You'll have money, motorbikes,

02:02:18.84,02:02:20.26
anything you want.

02:02:20.67,02:02:22.72
I already saved you once,

02:02:23.43,02:02:26.26
because here[br]they don't like you guys.

02:02:26.51,02:02:28.51
You're causing too much trouble.

02:02:29.60,02:02:31.43
It's wise to be with me,

02:02:31.56,02:02:34.85
that way you don't have to worry,[br]you're covered.

02:02:35.06,02:02:36.65
We want to stay alone,

02:02:37.15,02:02:39.23
we don't want to be under anyone.

02:02:40.48,02:02:43.03
We don't like to be under people.

02:02:43.95,02:02:46.11
We're just for us, that's all.

02:02:47.78,02:02:50.49
May I confide in you?

02:02:50.62,02:02:53.46
It's obvious you're courageous.

02:02:53.58,02:02:55.29
You're not talking to cops.

02:02:57.29,02:02:58.67
What is it?

02:02:58.79,02:03:02.42
I have a good job for you[br]and you'll earn a barrel of money.

02:03:02.55,02:03:05.84
- Money?[br]- Money's the first thing.

02:03:05.97,02:03:07.84
We know.

02:03:09.89,02:03:12.52
- May I come closer?[br]- Sure.

02:03:13.31,02:03:16.77
It's something not to be overheard,[br]just between us.

02:03:17.02,02:03:18.77
I need a big favor,

02:03:19.40,02:03:21.27
you could do a "job" for me.

02:03:21.40,02:03:23.78
I see you've got balls,

02:03:24.70,02:03:28.62
but this guy's a hot one, he's big.

02:03:29.16,02:03:31.12
We really like these things.

02:03:31.54,02:03:33.79
I'm crazy for them.

02:03:34.41,02:03:36.66
You have to kill Peppe the Horseman.

02:03:36.79,02:03:39.83
He's a traitor, he took my woman.

02:03:42.25,02:03:44.38
You have to shoot him in the balls

02:03:44.72,02:03:46.80
and then in the mouth.

02:03:46.97,02:03:48.76
I go crazy for these things.

02:03:50.18,02:03:53.14
But you have to do me a favor.

02:03:53.85,02:03:58.69
They told me you[br]stole some weapons from around here.

02:03:59.19,02:04:03.40
You have to give them back,[br]we gotta make them disappear.

02:04:04.36,02:04:06.82
- I'll give you the weapons.[br]- You will?

02:04:06.95,02:04:08.66
Weapons, motorbikes,[br]anything you want.

02:04:08.78,02:04:10.16
Let's talk about the money.

02:04:10.28,02:04:14.16
Tell me what you want[br]for this job.

02:04:14.41,02:04:15.91
A really good amount.

02:04:16.79,02:04:18.96
Is 10,000 euro enough?

02:04:21.54,02:04:22.63
Yes.

02:04:22.75,02:04:25.92
I'll give you an advance,[br]the rest when the job's done.

02:04:36.43,02:04:37.98
Put it in your pocket.

02:04:39.40,02:04:42.27
- Is it right?[br]- Fine.

02:06:14.53,02:06:16.37
- Not there.[br]- Then where?

02:06:17.37,02:06:20.16
- Where the fuck do we go?[br]- Who knows where he went!

02:06:23.25,02:06:25.08
- We lost him.[br]- Are you sure?

02:06:28.13,02:06:32.47
- Look over there.[br]- There's nothing.

02:06:33.43,02:06:36.26
Then where?

02:06:36.39,02:06:37.68
There he is!

02:08:27.83,02:08:29.00
Get off.

02:08:44.22,02:08:45.72
Come on!

02:09:50.54,02:09:52.96
For two kids such a waste of time.

02:09:53.25,02:09:54.88
Guys, it had to be done.

02:09:55.21,02:09:56.63
Everything's okay.

02:11:48.20,02:11:52.12
In Europe the Camorra has killed more[br]than all other criminal organizations.

02:11:52.20,02:11:55.08
4,000 deaths in the last 30 years,[br]one every three days.

02:11:55.71,02:11:59.33
Scampia is the biggest[br]drug-pushing locality in the world.

02:11:59.42,02:12:02.59
Daily sales per clan[br]run about 500,000 euro.

02:12:03.09,02:12:06.80
If clan-managed waste were piled,[br]it would reach 14,600 meters.

02:12:06.88,02:12:08.55
Everest is 8,850 meters.

02:12:08.64,02:12:11.97
There is a 20% increase in cancer[br]in the poisoned areas.

02:12:12.51,02:12:16.56
Gains from illegal activities are[br]reinvested in legal ones worldwide.

02:12:16.64,02:12:21.40
The Camorra has also invested[br]in the reconstruction of the Twin Towers.
