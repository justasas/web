1
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,755
How long you gonna be?.

2
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,262
Be right out,

3
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,397
you're a pain!

4
00:02:58,384 --> 00:02:59,463
Hey, American.

5
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:01,591
I'm still here, gettin' a manicure.

6
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:05,805
Things okay?.

7
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:08,889
Gettin' tanned?. Don't get burned!

8
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,893
Bruno's here too.

9
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,055
You got a crap body!

10
00:03:15,232 --> 00:03:17,308
Is Bruno here?.

11
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:19,308
He's over there.

12
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:28,694
You doin' a lamp?.

13
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,553
It's 2,000.

14
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:42,642
How much are you
supposed to get this week?.

15
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:43,842
9,200.

16
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,814
Sure?. It was less last week.

17
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:50,981
Yes, Don Ciro 9,200.

18
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:55,151
Another 2,000 euro and we're even.

19
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:58,237
Don Ciro, don't take all day.

20
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:00,282
He's slow.

21
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:03,534
Hurry, so we can go home.

22
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,621
Things okay out there?.

23
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,871
Keep your eyes open.

24
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,334
That's it.

25
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,598
Put paper cups in.

26
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,935
Toilet paper.

27
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:45,115
- Then, Mom?.
- Some shampoo.

28
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:48,448
A mozzarella...

29
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,622
Shampoo, not bath oil!

30
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:58,705
You're rushin' me!

31
00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:00,872
And you're drivin' me crazy!

32
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:09,095
Hurry up, there are
more groceries to deliver.

33
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,220
- Nothing else?.
- No.

34
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:18,645
- Be back later.
- Don't get yourself lost.

35
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,280
- Simone.
- Toto, what's up?.

36
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,244
- What's happening?.
- I'm workin'.

37
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:40,575
Know what happened?.
They arrested Vitale and Bon Bon.

38
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:42,532
Really?.

39
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:45,746
- Got somethin' to eat?.
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

40
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,795
Bye, see you.

41
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:06,520
Carmela, ma'am!

42
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:13,983
Hi, Boxer.

43
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:44,048
Two doses, two doses!

44
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:47,181
Please, give me a dose!

45
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,432
Gaetano, check it!

46
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:30,887
One, two, three...

47
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:36,307
Goodbye.

48
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:40,479
Don Ciro, be more punctual.

49
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:43,434
I'll pass it on.

50
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:52,899
Eleven and twelve.

51
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,946
See if he wants coffee.

52
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:58,114
No, but thank you anyway....

53
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:00,164
I'll show you out.

54
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,201
Have a good day.

55
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,634
Four hundred...

56
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,047
Five hundred.

57
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,050
The same amount again?.

58
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,229
I've said a hundred times
I can't manage like this.

59
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,305
Don Carlo...

60
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:34,483
Did you tell them I can't manage
on this chickenfeed?.

61
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:37,652
I have to pay rent, lights, water.

62
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:41,780
I can't survive,
I'm strapped with debts.

63
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:45,032
- I'll pass it on.
- You always say that!

64
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:48,036
Are you mockin' me?.

65
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:50,332
I don't get it!

66
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:52,416
Listen,

67
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,421
I've got a son to support,

68
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,593
for forty years
I've kept him off the streets,

69
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:01,677
he's unemployed.

70
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:04,884
What can I do,
go over to the other side?.

71
00:10:05,851 --> 00:10:09,979
They know, I served you honestly
for forty years.

72
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:13,230
My wife's in jail,
is this the thanks we get?.

73
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:17,228
Are we crazy?.
Do I have to raise hell?.

74
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,568
Silvana!

75
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,830
May I?.

76
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:35,199
Come on in!

77
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:37,118
Maria!

78
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,213
The bill?.

79
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,458
Talk to Mom.

80
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:51,716
Put this in your pocket.

81
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,766
Thank you.

82
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:09,446
Carabinieri on the street!

83
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:22,040
He's comin' out!

84
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:43,770
I'm the best, number one!

85
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:45,018
So?.

86
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:47,020
Go, Marco!

87
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:51,272
- I'll blast these roaches!
- Who do you think you're fighting?.

88
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:55,233
I'm number one! Tony Montana!

89
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,442
The world is ours!

90
00:11:57,576 --> 00:12:00,530
You don't know
who you're up against!

91
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:02,655
I'm Tony Montana!

92
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,707
- I'm the powerhouse!
- Yeah!

93
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,871
Come here.

94
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,912
Shit Colombians,

95
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:12,998
they're everywhere.

96
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:16,091
See, Colombians everywhere.

97
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,341
You really looked like Scarface.

98
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,892
You were good.

99
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,191
Now it all has to be ours,
the whole world.

100
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:40,153
Miami, all of it.

101
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,911
My friend, got stuff?.

102
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,467
You got stuff?.

103
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:16,681
- Got good stuff?.
- You got money?.

104
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:20,770
- Sure, you got coke?.
- What do you want to pay?.

105
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,982
Me?. 50.

106
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:28,232
- 55, can you do it?.
- No, 55 is too much, 50.

107
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,365
You sure?.

108
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,321
Wait here for me.

109
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:44,953
Where's Smarty?.

110
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:04,679
Hey, kid!

111
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,153
Give him the money.

112
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:28,580
- Is it all here?.
- Yeah.

113
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:47,263
- Okay?.
- Yes.

114
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:53,643
- Want to see it?.
- I want to try it.

115
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:56,898
I gave you the money!

116
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,894
Wait!

117
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:06,195
Open your hand.

118
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:11,329
It's good.

119
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,665
Give me all of it!

120
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:26,886
Grab the money!

121
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:38,908
Giovanni, I brought the kids.

122
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:40,075
Come in.

123
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,330
You know very well why you're here.

124
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:50,497
Too much ruckus going on in my area,
because I'm the boss here.

125
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:52,627
That's just you sayin'.

126
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,751
If I had you come here, I know.
No back-talk

127
00:16:57,638 --> 00:16:59,844
or I'll smash your face!

128
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:04,057
- What happened?.
- For the moment, nothing.

129
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,182
Get me?.

130
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:11,232
I can't be made to look bad
because of two kids like you.

131
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:14,478
The next time
I hear anything about you,

132
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,565
I'll blow your heads off.

133
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:20,566
- If it's like you say...
- Shut up when I'm talking.

134
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:22,781
Then if I come to realize

135
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,909
you're worth something,

136
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:28,914
which I'll determine and I'll decide,

137
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,000
you can work for me.

138
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:34,244
Is that clear?.

139
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,247
Show them out.

140
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:45,593
"I'll smash your face!"

141
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,803
And I'll tear your beard!

142
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,759
Without a T-shirt.

143
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,975
"Sweet Pea", looked like a bum.

144
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:55,142
A real bum.

145
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:59,315
He is a bum! Did you see
who he sent to get us?.

146
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,395
If that guy's the boss here,

147
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:04,527
then here we can be the bosses.

148
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:09,652
If a guy like him is boss here,
this area is ours!

149
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:12,701
I'll live for 30 years
if he's boss here.

150
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,868
Sure, because he's a retard!

151
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:21,122
Get it?. I'll live for 30 years.

152
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:24,125
But he could at least shave!

153
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:25,330
Shave!

154
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:28,381
"I'll smash your face!"

155
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:31,593
Let's go have a snort to spite him.

156
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:35,640
We've got everything,
we can do like we want.

157
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:41,890
Anyway, he's a fat shit-ass.

158
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:44,022
He bugged you?.

159
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:46,231
He showers once a week!

160
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:52,445
"I'll blow your heads off! "

161
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:18,592
Roberto!

162
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:30,932
Let's go, it's too small.

163
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:35,069
- But the methane one's big.
- No, it's small.

164
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,407
- Can I finish measuring?.
- No, we're wasting time.

165
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:46,580
- I have to take some shots.
- What a bore with these pictures!

166
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:48,615
Let's go!

167
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,955
Just look at this.

168
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,047
It's disgusting down there.

169
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:09,590
Here is perfect.

170
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,553
It's perfect.

171
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:15,932
We're near the highway,
the trucks can get really close,

172
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:19,859
they dump the earth
and cover all the water.

173
00:20:20,028 --> 00:20:21,107
Perfect.

174
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,315
Franco, it's 85 meters.

175
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,197
Get the length too.

176
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,411
Come here.

177
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,579
Dante.

178
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:38,749
Hello, everything okay?.

179
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:43,002
This is Roberto.

180
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,259
- It's time we made room for youth.
- We need new energy.

181
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:51,343
Take a few more shots.

182
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:55,388
Did you hear?.

183
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,552
They bombed me,

184
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,602
at the cement plant.

185
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:02,848
A whole wall came down,

186
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:04,806
slowly.

187
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:06,900
Be careful.

188
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:09,026
Zio resolved it.

189
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:13,072
I'd forgotten to pay
for some land I'd bought.

190
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,236
- An injunction against payment?.
- Yeah!

191
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,493
- What do you think?.
- It's fine.

192
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:23,536
- Can we fill this quarry?.
- Sure can.

193
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:25,666
Tell Zio it's fine.

194
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:29,881
Remember, everything clean:
terracing, solid stuff...

195
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:34,044
Or the redevelopment agency
will break our balls.

196
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,255
Don't worry,
you emptied it and I'll fill it.

197
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,769
All the pieces have to be cut
and the sizes worked out.

198
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,896
They want 120 of these.

199
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,534
Six and seven are identical.

200
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:16,795
Here the satin is cut on the bias.

201
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:18,875
It's all hand-hemmed.

202
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:20,925
Is it tough?.

203
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:24,095
The models aren't hard,
I can do it.

204
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,388
Eight hundred items in two months,
is our request.

205
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:33,312
Keep in mind
we start at 50 euros per item.

206
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:37,643
You've seen the models,
the price is good,

207
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:40,652
estimate and make your offers.

208
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,986
Thirty euro, 30 days?.

209
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,900
Don't go any lower.

210
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:49,110
This is high fashion,
it's not pret-a-porter.

211
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,201
Forty-five, in two months.

212
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:55,371
- Ms. Zamarion!
- Yes?.

213
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:57,535
Thirty-eight, forty.

214
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,501
That's a very interesting proposal.

215
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:02,581
Thirty-five, thirty-five,

216
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,758
excellent workmanship
and delivery times respected.

217
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,920
Thirty, thirty!

218
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:18,301
Please,

219
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,266
we're not imposing anything!

220
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:24,516
Did we say thirty, thirty?.

221
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:27,645
At this point

222
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:29,730
twenty-eight, thirty!

223
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:35,944
Thirty, twenty-five!

224
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,161
I can't lose this bid.

225
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,409
Come here, there's some bubbly!

226
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:48,414
Are they coming?.

227
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:50,713
- I don't think so.
- Why not?.

228
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:56,715
Five days less for delivery,

229
00:23:56,806 --> 00:23:59,842
we'll have to work overtime,
and I'll do nights...

230
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,009
What's odd about that?.

231
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:04,141
They're talking overtime pay.

232
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:06,268
They'll get it!

233
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:09,398
Am I scared of a little overtime?.

234
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:13,436
Like the last time?.

235
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,645
Don't worry,
this time it's a sure thing.

236
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:21,868
- They've lost their trust.
- I know.

237
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:26,033
- I asked you to talk to them.
- You do it, please.

238
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:29,208
You're on closer terms,
they respect you.

239
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:32,292
Do me this favor.

240
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:35,498
Don't say no, go talk to them.

241
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:38,584
You know I'm fond of you,

242
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:40,716
I'll have to make
a gold statue to you!

243
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:43,679
I'll go down and see the accountant
for the money.

244
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:52,014
Sorry, how much is this?.

245
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,185
Ten thousand.

246
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:58,357
It's not enough, I need more.

247
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,482
Twice that at least.

248
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:03,486
Mr. Enzo,
you're already "complicated".

249
00:25:03,574 --> 00:25:05,697
Yes, but for personal affairs.

250
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:08,701
I need this for work.

251
00:25:08,787 --> 00:25:10,910
I'll give it back in three months.

252
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:13,914
But this isn't enough.

253
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,158
If you don't need it
and it's not enough,

254
00:25:17,086 --> 00:25:18,248
I'll take it back.

255
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:20,292
It's best for you.

256
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:23,331
Don't be like that, listen,

257
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:25,548
I need at least double!

258
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:28,468
It's no risk,

259
00:25:28,555 --> 00:25:29,717
you'll earn from it, right?.

260
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:31,713
What can I say?.

261
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:34,761
I'll pass it on,
can you make-do for now?.

262
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:36,933
Yes, I'll take it.

263
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,440
Congratulations, Mr. Pasquale.

264
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:51,605
Thank you.

265
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:53,696
We met yesterday.

266
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,820
I need your help.

267
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:07,252
I am having trouble with work.

268
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:12,419
I have to get into
haute couture right away,

269
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:16,510
but for me

270
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:19,591
it is very difficult.

271
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:21,765
I need help.

272
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,020
You are

273
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:30,017
a great master,

274
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:32,310
you are very important for me.

275
00:26:33,154 --> 00:26:35,194
You teach ten lessons

276
00:26:35,406 --> 00:26:38,323
to workers in my factory.

277
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:41,658
I pay you in cash,

278
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:44,780
2,000 euros a lesson

279
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,948
for ten lessons.

280
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:52,121
We work together,
but no one knows it,

281
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:55,165
just the two of us.

282
00:26:57,176 --> 00:26:59,215
I need your help.

283
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,338
Think it over.

284
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:09,685
- What's the cloth like?.
- Come and see.

285
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,250
I've got nothin'!

286
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,384
Don't move!

287
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:57,150
They must have gone over to his side,

288
00:28:58,034 --> 00:29:01,201
or they'd have arrested
me first and then those other guys.

289
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:04,495
Believe me?. All of them were there
when I called you.

290
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,457
I said: Check out this car,
it's suspect.

291
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:09,582
This stuff here is ours.

292
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:11,668
My gun!

293
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,799
Check this stuff out,
there should be fifty-six.

294
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:21,086
Good, Toto, this is for you.

295
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,473
How can I get working with you?.

296
00:29:28,311 --> 00:29:30,387
We'll let you know.

297
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,729
- Did you turn off the water?.
- Of course!

298
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,851
- Can I help out?.
- No, you'll get wet.

299
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:39,900
Doesn't matter!

300
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:42,857
Come and see.

301
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,989
Careful not to slip.

302
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:50,205
- Is it coming from the well?.
- No, I think it's from the pipe.

303
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:53,374
Careful, water's coming in.

304
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,461
See if you can close it.

305
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,669
It's closed,
but it's the pipe that...

306
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,130
I'd give you a hand, but...

307
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:11,220
What a great day!

308
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:14,182
Push it all in one direction.

309
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:23,520
I thought I'd be having coffee!

310
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:26,814
- Nice coffee, huh?.
- I'll have some next time.

311
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,119
Totore, things okay?.

312
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:41,410
- Can I say hi?.
- No, you gotta leave.

313
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:44,372
Go down with these bags!

314
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:47,545
You have to move!

315
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:50,751
Ma'am, go around the other way.

316
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:53,886
- What's going on?.
- Everything's fine, leave.

317
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:15,861
Lucia?.

318
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:49,176
Come closer.

319
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:53,184
- What's your name?.
- Luigi.

320
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:57,396
- Are you scared?.
- No.

321
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,645
- Sure?.
- No.

322
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:01,729
We'll see.

323
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:05,868
- Are you strong?.
- Yeah!

324
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:08,993
Let's see how strong you are.

325
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:15,165
Why are you shaking?.

326
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:18,206
No?.

327
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:27,572
- See how strong this kid is.
- Come closer!

328
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:37,962
- Are you scared?.
- Yes.

329
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:57,765
Now you're a man.

330
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,783
Nothin'! Everything's okay!

331
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:23,874
When I did my piercing,
I got an infection.

332
00:35:23,964 --> 00:35:25,921
Let's see.

333
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:29,043
You went and did it there?.

334
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,262
- I'd like to have it on my eyebrow.
- Stinks.

335
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,423
It's nicer there, you're right.

336
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,641
It's gonna rain.

337
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:46,890
Everything's okay!

338
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:49,061
A car's coming!

339
00:35:51,072 --> 00:35:53,064
It went in!

340
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:57,282
It's going in!

341
00:35:58,245 --> 00:36:00,321
Check out this other one!

342
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:04,575
Everything's okay!

343
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:40,066
Sorry I'm late, the Councilman,
City Hall, the traffic...

344
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,191
- My father.
- How do you do.

345
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:50,373
I'm glad he's with you
you're a good person.

346
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,576
He's in your care.

347
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,661
He's a clever guy.

348
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,829
I don't doubt that but...

349
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:00,877
- Having work is important to him.
- Of course.

350
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:03,962
I tried so hard
to find him work in Naples...

351
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:07,220
- Where do you work?.
- In the hospital, intensive care.

352
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,222
A bad division.

353
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,557
I tried to get him in,
but I have no connections.

354
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,516
He's all set now.

355
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:21,645
You did something no one else did.

356
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:23,895
I thank you, you raised him well.

357
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:25,981
Have you always worked in Naples?.

358
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:28,983
No, also in Trieste, Udine,

359
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:32,110
- Venice...
- That's where we're going.

360
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:35,288
I told him about Venice.

361
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:39,541
He's excited, it's his first time.

362
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,705
Dad, we have a plane.

363
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:46,671
Did you bring some things?.

364
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:48,923
What's that, your gym bag?.

365
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,971
- Goodbye.
- He's in your care.

366
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:16,905
- What do you pay for disposal?.
- Today I'm paying 50.

367
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,157
Your offer?.

368
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:21,077
We can halve your costs,

369
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,157
25 cents a kilo.

370
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,242
That's good,

371
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:27,411
but is it all "clean",
like they say in the United States?.

372
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:29,502
Since it's toxic waste,

373
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,506
certification,
storage and transportation.

374
00:38:34,802 --> 00:38:37,886
- Is there a contract to look over?.
- Of course.

375
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:44,051
In case you're wondering,

376
00:38:44,144 --> 00:38:46,220
the disposal cycle

377
00:38:46,312 --> 00:38:49,230
goes to the disposal area
in Marcianise.

378
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:51,313
I'm telling you in fairness.

379
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,559
Thank you for the information,

380
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:56,733
but my only concern
is that it's "clean".

381
00:38:57,573 --> 00:38:59,695
You can rest assured of that.

382
00:38:59,783 --> 00:39:01,859
We can dispose of all the waste

383
00:39:01,993 --> 00:39:04,033
that you produce in a year.

384
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:06,033
Eight hundred tons.

385
00:39:07,957 --> 00:39:09,036
It's not a problem.

386
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,287
That's a lot.

387
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:16,544
My concern is disposal.

388
00:39:17,382 --> 00:39:19,624
We serve various companies,
you can check.

389
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:22,716
I already have!

390
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:25,755
Don't worry.

391
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:29,968
As far as I can see,
there's maximum transparency.

392
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:31,927
Absolutely.

393
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:37,355
- The warehouses at Teverola?.
- We use them for tires.

394
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:39,313
Exactly.

395
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:42,521
Will we put the tannery waste
in the quarry?.

396
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,483
- Don't talk foolishness.
- Where then?.

397
00:39:45,574 --> 00:39:47,697
Check the European catalogue.

398
00:39:49,828 --> 00:39:51,820
Here they are, 04.

399
00:39:52,831 --> 00:39:55,072
The ones in red,
are among the most dangerous.

400
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:59,208
"Exhausted degreasing baths
with solvents, no liquid phase."

401
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:01,367
No, no good.

402
00:40:03,382 --> 00:40:05,457
Then 4-11:

403
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:08,509
"Waste containing halogenated
compounds from operations

404
00:40:08,595 --> 00:40:10,634
of manufacturing and finishing."

405
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:12,714
These are good.

406
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:16,756
It's stuff the earth absorbs,
we'll mix it with compost.

407
00:40:16,852 --> 00:40:17,967
Fertilizer!

408
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:24,065
All that leaves is
Milan's sweeping refuse,

409
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,143
that's 60 trucks.

410
00:40:27,278 --> 00:40:30,314
- The quarries at San Felice?.
- They're too small.

411
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:32,445
I don't think so, look.

412
00:40:32,658 --> 00:40:34,615
Let me see.

413
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:43,032
They're too small
and they're shallow,

414
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:46,084
they're no good.

415
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,630
Yes... I've got
ten contracts out of ten.

416
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:06,975
Is he near you?.

417
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:11,104
Put him on.

418
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:13,225
I'll talk to him.

419
00:41:36,215 --> 00:41:39,169
I told him, everything's okay.

420
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:55,849
- Do you like traveling?.
- Sure!

421
00:41:56,108 --> 00:41:58,100
We'll take more trips.

422
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:09,569
Everyone here works in boats?.

423
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:13,574
Everyone, firemen, ambulances...

424
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,916
- Funerals.
- I've already seen two.

425
00:42:18,795 --> 00:42:20,871
Even the dead go by boat!

426
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:46,060
Wow, they've got so many!

427
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:53,237
Steady me.

428
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,448
There's nothing here.

429
00:44:02,221 --> 00:44:04,213
Nothing?.

430
00:44:04,306 --> 00:44:06,263
Are you sure?.

431
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:34,366
Oh God!

432
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:36,456
Look what's here!

433
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,923
See?. It's like you said!

434
00:44:49,055 --> 00:44:51,012
Look here!

435
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,097
A Beretta 93!

436
00:44:53,184 --> 00:44:55,140
A Kalashnikov!

437
00:44:55,352 --> 00:44:57,428
See if they're loaded.

438
00:44:58,397 --> 00:45:00,555
- Check.
- It's unloaded.

439
00:45:16,121 --> 00:45:18,113
Look, an M12!

440
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,370
This is the 921.

441
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:22,371
That bearded bum!

442
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,583
We'll see how
he blows my head off!

443
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:28,755
Enough for Casale di Principe!
Everybody!

444
00:45:30,634 --> 00:45:32,757
Won't blow my head off now, eh?.

445
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:39,137
Should I put two in?.

446
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:43,177
And Nikita's?.

447
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,263
And the 38?.

448
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:05,198
- Want to see how I can shoot?.
- Show me!

449
00:46:06,249 --> 00:46:08,206
Show me!

450
00:46:09,294 --> 00:46:11,333
Aim there!

451
00:46:46,952 --> 00:46:48,861
I hit it!

452
00:47:05,552 --> 00:47:07,675
We'll blow
the Colombians' heads off!

453
00:47:16,103 --> 00:47:18,060
That's good.

454
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:24,358
Everything okay?.

455
00:47:29,574 --> 00:47:31,613
With love and feeling.

456
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,371
- What is it?.
- Your wife's on the phone.

457
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:49,502
Tell her not to wait up.

458
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:52,584
Don't get tired out, need anything?.

459
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,633
No, thanks.

460
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:56,797
- You'll lock up?.
- Yes.

461
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:58,803
Goodnight.

462
00:48:22,872 --> 00:48:24,781
Xian?.

463
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,401
I have been waiting for you.

464
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:06,653
- I got lost.
- I am happy you came.

465
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:22,164
Please sit down.

466
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:27,426
We are cooking fish.

467
00:49:37,772 --> 00:49:39,812
I've already eaten.

468
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,023
Try a typical Chinese dish.

469
00:49:43,986 --> 00:49:45,149
Okay?.

470
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:54,452
Just cooked, it is good.

471
00:49:54,496 --> 00:49:56,488
Meat with bell peppers.

472
00:49:56,581 --> 00:49:58,620
I've already eaten.

473
00:50:01,794 --> 00:50:02,908
Taste.

474
00:50:03,796 --> 00:50:05,835
We use chopsticks.

475
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,045
- I don't know how to use them.
- Try!

476
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:13,217
I am pleased,

477
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:15,385
we have a little toast.

478
00:50:16,515 --> 00:50:19,386
We go to the factory.

479
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,898
Why not?.

480
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:35,111
I put a pillow in here.

481
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,198
It's dangerous.

482
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:42,366
I already told you,
no one can know, just us.

483
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,615
It's better for both of us.

484
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,711
- Won't I need air?.
- No, there's an opening.

485
00:50:50,796 --> 00:50:53,880
I'll open the front window,
so air will come in.

486
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:57,966
Forgive me.

487
00:51:00,096 --> 00:51:01,341
Are we sure?.

488
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:06,557
It is best for both of us,
because it is dangerous.

489
00:51:09,647 --> 00:51:12,600
- Does air come through here?.
- Yes.

490
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:14,892
And I'll open the window too.

491
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:22,452
Please come in, Mr. Pasquale.

492
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:25,752
All are waiting for you.

493
00:52:28,843 --> 00:52:30,882
All are very happy.

494
00:52:46,442 --> 00:52:48,683
I told them who you are
and all are happy.

495
00:52:51,696 --> 00:52:53,689
What a nice factory!

496
00:52:53,865 --> 00:52:55,988
More than 80 people.

497
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,779
I'm moved.

498
00:53:45,954 --> 00:53:47,993
What can I say?.

499
00:53:49,165 --> 00:53:51,241
To do this work

500
00:53:52,334 --> 00:53:55,205
you need lots of patience...

501
00:54:00,675 --> 00:54:02,667
...and lots of love.

502
00:54:08,974 --> 00:54:11,014
For the first lesson...

503
00:54:14,062 --> 00:54:16,185
...I'll cut out a bodice.

504
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,644
Let's begin.

505
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:40,077
You must place patterns carefully.

506
00:54:46,508 --> 00:54:48,584
Spread the cloth well...

507
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,529
Maria, are you asleep?.

508
00:55:19,746 --> 00:55:21,904
Where have I been, in China?.

509
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:27,077
They were all bowing to me.

510
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:31,164
Master!

511
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:34,299
They called me "master"!

512
00:55:39,514 --> 00:55:42,633
- Did you know the Chinese can cook?.
- The Chinese?.

513
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:44,806
Darn right!

514
00:55:44,935 --> 00:55:47,853
They cooked a delicious bass!

515
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:53,270
There were boxes everywhere

516
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:56,186
and they put me in the trunk!

517
00:55:57,363 --> 00:55:59,439
Both coming and going.

518
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:04,739
I need some sleep.

519
00:56:08,707 --> 00:56:09,821
Here.

520
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:12,915
I have to sleep a few hours.

521
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:19,212
What's this money?.

522
00:56:30,685 --> 00:56:32,724
Where did you get it?.

523
00:56:32,853 --> 00:56:34,893
I have to sleep.

524
00:56:37,983 --> 00:56:39,975
Help me understand.

525
00:56:40,068 --> 00:56:42,191
I talked to my son this morning,

526
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:45,196
he said: "Mom I'm leaving,

527
00:56:45,406 --> 00:56:47,446
I'm going to be a secessionist."

528
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:50,443
Really?.

529
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:56,662
What did you say?.

530
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,826
He's convinced,

531
00:56:59,836 --> 00:57:01,959
he said: "We're great,

532
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:06,126
we'll win the war,
the others are nobodies".

533
00:57:06,175 --> 00:57:09,341
War?. A bunch of morons
warring against us?.

534
00:57:10,304 --> 00:57:12,343
You have to stop him.

535
00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:15,554
This side is the right side.

536
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,677
Have you seen what's happening?.

537
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:21,852
There are killings every day.

538
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:26,900
Don't say anything to anybody,
not even your husband.

539
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,151
Who'd ever tell him!

540
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,401
When he gets out, what'll he do?.
Father and son will kill each other?.

541
00:57:36,285 --> 00:57:38,408
No, because your son
will stay right here.

542
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:42,704
They'll all come to a bad end.

543
00:57:47,796 --> 00:57:49,871
Do you feel so sure about that?.

544
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:51,085
I don't.

545
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:54,048
I do.

546
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:49,218
When will we see each other again?.

547
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:51,302
When you change sides.

548
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,517
Want to stay faithful?. Go ahead!

549
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:56,639
You go your way and I go another.

550
00:58:56,691 --> 00:59:00,735
But we can still have
a pizza together with friends.

551
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,776
I'm telling you again,

552
00:59:02,905 --> 00:59:04,862
friend, enemy.

553
00:59:08,034 --> 00:59:11,118
We've known each other for so long,
why go with them?.

554
00:59:11,204 --> 00:59:14,370
Remember when we were brothers?.
Now we're enemies.

555
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:20,581
I'm telling you, if you don't
change sides, we might kill you

556
00:59:20,671 --> 00:59:22,710
or you might kill us.

557
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,880
Because we're at war,

558
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:28,919
people are dying every day.

559
00:59:34,308 --> 00:59:37,344
- You could have stayed with us...
- What for?.

560
00:59:37,436 --> 00:59:39,475
I'm best on the other side.

561
00:59:52,866 --> 00:59:53,981
Bye, Simone.

562
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,796
Want a little Sambuca?.

563
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,182
You'll be right off, don't worry.

564
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,227
Takes time.

565
01:01:30,996 --> 01:01:33,035
Careful when you go out.

566
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:35,032
Thank you.

567
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:09,038
Gaetano, show him.

568
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:12,161
- It's big.
- You're right.

569
01:03:13,046 --> 01:03:14,208
- Enzo!
- What?.

570
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:18,215
Do I have to tell you?.

571
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:21,467
It's awesome.

572
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:23,544
I like it.

573
01:03:23,597 --> 01:03:25,554
Like it?.

574
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,638
You look great.

575
01:03:27,768 --> 01:03:29,677
Toto, show it off.

576
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:32,934
It's really nice.

577
01:03:43,407 --> 01:03:45,565
- How many so far?.
- 45 doses.

578
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:47,572
Okay.

579
01:03:49,579 --> 01:03:51,618
It's good stuff.

580
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:07,257
How many so far?.

581
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,466
Fifty-two,

582
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,466
plus four that guy's still got.

583
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:14,515
- Understand?.
- Yeah.

584
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,980
I'll get back to you later.

585
01:04:27,112 --> 01:04:30,149
- How many?.
- Fifty-two and that guy's got four.

586
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,280
Then we'll total it.

587
01:04:37,622 --> 01:04:39,661
Hello!

588
01:04:41,751 --> 01:04:42,913
Nice, eh?.

589
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:45,870
Hi, gorgeous!

590
01:04:46,922 --> 01:04:47,918
Girls!

591
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:49,002
Beautiful!

592
01:04:49,091 --> 01:04:50,205
Alessia?.

593
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:57,388
What are you doing here?. Get out.

594
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:01,639
I don't want to see you around here.

595
01:05:03,645 --> 01:05:06,681
We have to go crying
at the prison gates?.

596
01:05:06,773 --> 01:05:09,774
What I went through with your father
was enough for me.

597
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:15,050
Good morning, Jacob.

598
01:07:15,138 --> 01:07:18,056
- Are you alright?.
- Fine, thank you, and you?.

599
01:07:19,184 --> 01:07:21,223
Have a good trip?.

600
01:07:21,311 --> 01:07:23,386
A very nice trip.

601
01:07:25,314 --> 01:07:28,517
- Do you have documents?.
- It's humanitarian aid.

602
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:30,648
Yes, it's humanitarian aid.

603
01:07:30,777 --> 01:07:33,648
- Everything okay?.
- Yes.

604
01:07:35,907 --> 01:07:38,030
They've already called an ambulance.

605
01:07:42,037 --> 01:07:43,282
Get back to work!

606
01:07:49,419 --> 01:07:51,412
Go back to work!

607
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:53,663
What happened?.

608
01:07:54,757 --> 01:07:56,666
As they were dumping,

609
01:07:56,717 --> 01:07:59,753
two drums opened
and spilled on a truck driver.

610
01:07:59,887 --> 01:08:02,045
- Have you already called zio?.
- No!

611
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:06,056
- They wanted to call an ambulance!
- I'll take care of this.

612
01:08:09,229 --> 01:08:11,435
Pay the truckers
and tell them to fuck off.

613
01:08:12,315 --> 01:08:16,442
- Who'll drive the trucks?.
- Don't the blacks know how?.

614
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,603
Can you drive?.

615
01:08:18,654 --> 01:08:21,738
They can't even ride bikes!

616
01:08:23,825 --> 01:08:25,817
I'll handle this.

617
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,994
Don't let them touch the trucks,
they're ours.

618
01:08:31,082 --> 01:08:33,121
Roberto, wait here.

619
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:34,281
Calm down!

620
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:45,756
You made a mistake, you had us doing
a job we shouldn't have!

621
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:47,884
It just happened!

622
01:09:36,724 --> 01:09:39,843
- I'm taking the red one.
- No, that's mine!

623
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:49,476
- Take that one.
- I'll take this one!

624
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:57,773
- I'm not tall enough!
- Climb up there!

625
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,067
Wake up, get some cushions!

626
01:10:11,247 --> 01:10:14,450
- The keys?.
- Look under the seat!

627
01:10:18,546 --> 01:10:20,668
Come on! Are you sleeping?.

628
01:10:21,715 --> 01:10:23,791
Can't you see there's work to do?.

629
01:10:23,926 --> 01:10:26,001
Put this under your butt!

630
01:10:27,971 --> 01:10:30,010
Put it under your butt.

631
01:10:30,098 --> 01:10:32,220
Go slowly
and drive the truck down there.

632
01:10:33,184 --> 01:10:35,176
Then I'll pay you.

633
01:10:39,565 --> 01:10:41,604
Catch this cushion.

634
01:10:44,778 --> 01:10:46,651
Come on!

635
01:10:49,949 --> 01:10:51,906
Go slow!

636
01:10:55,037 --> 01:10:57,195
Move forward
and make space for that one!

637
01:10:59,124 --> 01:11:01,247
Roberto, tell him what to do!

638
01:11:06,631 --> 01:11:08,588
All the way down there!

639
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:58,139
- What is it?.
- It's the new list.

640
01:12:59,148 --> 01:13:01,271
Have you already paid
the Mellone family?.

641
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:03,398
And the redhead's family too?.

642
01:13:04,236 --> 01:13:04,484
Of course.

643
01:13:05,362 --> 01:13:06,560
Wasted money.

644
01:13:07,614 --> 01:13:10,484
Let's make not make these mistakes
anymore.

645
01:13:10,617 --> 01:13:12,693
Are these the only ones?.

646
01:13:13,745 --> 01:13:15,820
More money and less work.

647
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:18,870
But more risk.

648
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,997
What risk?.

649
01:13:22,044 --> 01:13:24,202
Just don't go into certain areas,

650
01:13:24,296 --> 01:13:27,296
the Seven Buildings, the Smurf Houses
and the Blue Houses.

651
01:13:27,424 --> 01:13:30,377
As for the rest, you can go anywhere.

652
01:13:30,426 --> 01:13:33,427
Maria's not here, I already paid her.

653
01:13:35,723 --> 01:13:38,759
- Isn't her husband with us?.
- Yes, but her son betrayed.

654
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:40,890
They mustn't get a cent.

655
01:13:44,022 --> 01:13:47,141
These things are none of your affair,
respect the list.

656
01:14:07,918 --> 01:14:09,081
Who is it?.

657
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:22,551
What is it?.

658
01:14:22,598 --> 01:14:25,634
- Not letting me in?.
- Tell me.

659
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:27,849
No one's home.

660
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:29,808
The week's pay.

661
01:14:29,855 --> 01:14:32,974
- Sure, but no one's home.
- I'll leave it with you.

662
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:35,142
Just a minute and I'll let you in.

663
01:14:46,495 --> 01:14:48,534
- Are you alone?.
- Yes.

664
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:51,658
- You came by yourself?.
- I'm alone!

665
01:14:51,749 --> 01:14:53,706
I'm alone.

666
01:14:53,876 --> 01:14:57,043
You can give this pittance
to your cronies, hear me?.

667
01:15:00,215 --> 01:15:02,255
Where's the list?.

668
01:15:03,343 --> 01:15:05,382
Don't move!

669
01:15:06,262 --> 01:15:08,338
Put your hands on the floor.

670
01:15:08,556 --> 01:15:12,505
You put our names
together with your cronies'?.

671
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,639
Motherfucker!

672
01:15:14,645 --> 01:15:16,721
We hate those people.

673
01:15:16,772 --> 01:15:19,891
Tell your friends that we'll come
get them in their homes

674
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:22,106
and we'll shoot them
in the head like you!

675
01:15:24,195 --> 01:15:27,231
- How did you get here?.
- On my motorbike.

676
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:30,324
- Now I'll shoot him.
- Not in here.

677
01:15:30,451 --> 01:15:32,490
Go get your bike.

678
01:15:33,412 --> 01:15:35,488
Is anyone here?.

679
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:36,653
Leave now!

680
01:16:25,584 --> 01:16:26,698
Don Ciro!

681
01:16:31,964 --> 01:16:34,004
What an idiot.

682
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:43,347
Don Ciro!
Where in hell are you going?.

683
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:45,388
He's nuts.

684
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,644
You're acting like a skittish horse,

685
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,725
where are you running to?.

686
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,772
You made me take the steps
four at a time.

687
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,021
What can we do with you?.

688
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,154
Why are you running?.

689
01:17:02,992 --> 01:17:05,198
A wild horse is what you seem.

690
01:17:07,246 --> 01:17:09,369
When will we talk a little?.

691
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:13,497
Not even answering?.

692
01:17:13,668 --> 01:17:16,622
I've got to see
what to do with this guy,

693
01:17:16,796 --> 01:17:18,789
I have to blast him.

694
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,924
What did you give me?.
The same money again?.

695
01:17:22,009 --> 01:17:24,085
Is this guy an idiot?.

696
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:27,093
Or are they making him
be an asshole?.

697
01:17:29,141 --> 01:17:31,263
Waiting for me to lose my head?.

698
01:17:32,435 --> 01:17:34,475
What can I do?.

699
01:17:41,694 --> 01:17:43,733
Let's do a stick-up?.

700
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:44,900
A stick-up.

701
01:17:45,781 --> 01:17:47,903
- What?.
- A stick-up.

702
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:51,027
- No way!
- Let's do it!

703
01:17:52,036 --> 01:17:55,369
- Stick-up a video games room?.
- Our money's run out.

704
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:00,375
- What can this place have?.
- Money!

705
01:18:00,544 --> 01:18:03,461
Listen to me for once.

706
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:05,706
Cut the bullshit!

707
01:18:06,799 --> 01:18:09,883
- A hold-up, no way!
- Listen to me.

708
01:18:09,969 --> 01:18:13,005
Let's play one more euro and go home.

709
01:18:13,097 --> 01:18:15,173
We're out of money!

710
01:18:18,185 --> 01:18:20,391
They must have about 50 cents.

711
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:23,347
Do we do it or not?.

712
01:18:24,357 --> 01:18:26,645
You get that one and
I'll take these guys down.

713
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:30,646
- See all the people.
- It'll work!

714
01:18:31,739 --> 01:18:33,731
Something fast.

715
01:18:39,037 --> 01:18:41,029
Are you ready?.

716
01:18:42,123 --> 01:18:43,285
Yes or no?.

717
01:18:46,418 --> 01:18:48,494
This is a hold-up!

718
01:18:49,546 --> 01:18:51,539
On the floor!

719
01:18:55,718 --> 01:18:56,833
Get out of there!

720
01:20:47,193 --> 01:20:49,435
- She's hot!
- She sucks.

721
01:20:49,487 --> 01:20:51,527
What!

722
01:20:52,573 --> 01:20:55,527
- You like her?.
- What's not to like!

723
01:20:55,576 --> 01:20:58,660
You like one thing, I like another.

724
01:21:02,874 --> 01:21:04,867
Right now!

725
01:21:06,002 --> 01:21:08,208
- The blonde in the side room?.
- Yeah.

726
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:12,413
Hillary?.

727
01:21:23,851 --> 01:21:24,930
Right away!

728
01:21:26,896 --> 01:21:28,935
I can't even stand still.

729
01:21:29,023 --> 01:21:31,098
I'll let you back in later.

730
01:21:36,321 --> 01:21:39,275
- What's your name?.
- Kristal.

731
01:21:41,534 --> 01:21:44,535
- What do you want to do?.
- Everything.

732
01:21:44,745 --> 01:21:48,789
Have you ever stripped a girl?.
I'll teach you.

733
01:21:48,874 --> 01:21:51,874
- You're the first.
- You go really slow.

734
01:21:53,044 --> 01:21:58,038
- I'm too horny.
- Sure, but you have to go slow.

735
01:22:02,386 --> 01:22:04,425
You have to strip right away.

736
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,846
What do we do?.

737
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:20,181
Want to have sex?.

738
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:22,232
Wait!

739
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:24,234
Such a hurry!

740
01:22:40,837 --> 01:22:42,035
Did I hurt you?.

741
01:22:42,088 --> 01:22:45,208
- Why not?.
- Don't bite, it hurts.

742
01:22:51,347 --> 01:22:53,386
Hey, zip up!

743
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:55,506
Zip up!

744
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:58,762
- Look, I'll call...
- Call who you want.

745
01:22:59,604 --> 01:23:00,600
Zip up!

746
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:01,893
Come here!

747
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:04,896
- Now!
- You do it.

748
01:23:06,026 --> 01:23:09,027
- Like this?.
- It's not allowed.

749
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:11,193
Or I'll leave.

750
01:23:12,115 --> 01:23:14,191
Come here, I zipped.

751
01:23:16,286 --> 01:23:17,448
I'm gonna hurt you.

752
01:23:17,495 --> 01:23:20,412
No, I'm doing the hurting to you.

753
01:23:20,581 --> 01:23:23,617
- Really?.
- What do you think?.

754
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:44,599
Don't do anything to me!

755
01:23:52,985 --> 01:23:55,902
Where are the weapons?.

756
01:24:06,331 --> 01:24:09,415
I'll give you one day
to put them back!

757
01:24:10,459 --> 01:24:11,704
Get the message?.

758
01:24:14,797 --> 01:24:17,999
- Do I shoot them in the head?.
- Let them live a little more.

759
01:24:18,884 --> 01:24:20,923
Get back in the car.

760
01:24:24,055 --> 01:24:25,253
Get the message?.

761
01:24:36,566 --> 01:24:37,764
Sweet Pea, get up!

762
01:24:40,945 --> 01:24:44,859
Don't be scared, I'm here,
we're at war!

763
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:46,028
Get lost!

764
01:24:46,116 --> 01:24:47,990
Get up!

765
01:24:54,332 --> 01:24:55,411
Enough!

766
01:24:56,376 --> 01:24:58,498
Come here, don't worry!

767
01:24:59,503 --> 01:25:01,662
- I'm getting out of here.
- No!

768
01:25:01,755 --> 01:25:03,831
We'll beat these guys!

769
01:25:04,716 --> 01:25:05,961
Listen to me!

770
01:25:25,735 --> 01:25:27,811
You're making me waste time,

771
01:25:29,739 --> 01:25:32,823
you said you made a mark,
but where is it?.

772
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:34,901
Oh, what is it?.

773
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:43,285
- Remember I made a mark!
- Yeah, but you can't find it!

774
01:25:46,504 --> 01:25:48,627
You're as dumb as they come.

775
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:04,258
Took you half an hour!

776
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:07,221
Let's move, I have to shoot,

777
01:26:07,314 --> 01:26:09,437
I can't stand not shooting!

778
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,598
- Want to shoot?.
- Right away!

779
01:26:14,612 --> 01:26:17,696
- Did you load it?.
- You'd better shut up.

780
01:26:17,782 --> 01:26:19,821
Sweet Pea, do like I tell you.

781
01:26:21,035 --> 01:26:24,984
I don't give a fuck what you think.

782
01:26:25,038 --> 01:26:28,158
We break everyone's balls,
but who've we killed?.

783
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:30,331
Do like I say and get moving!

784
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,416
Move!

785
01:26:33,546 --> 01:26:35,538
Where are we going?.

786
01:26:36,507 --> 01:26:38,630
Do I have to beat you up?.

787
01:26:39,635 --> 01:26:41,841
Do we have to war with each other?.

788
01:26:42,804 --> 01:26:46,884
I'm not warring with you,
all we have to do is shoot!

789
01:26:46,975 --> 01:26:50,178
- We're going to shoot alone?.
- Yeah, just you and me!

790
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:54,305
- Not thinking about later?.
- I don't want to think a thing!

791
01:26:54,398 --> 01:26:58,348
Want to take the wrong steps,
we'll never grow that way.

792
01:26:58,485 --> 01:27:00,561
Listening to you, we'll die sooner.

793
01:27:02,572 --> 01:27:04,611
Can I say something?.

794
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:09,828
Those kids don't know how to behave,
they're just raising Cain.

795
01:27:09,912 --> 01:27:12,913
- Why?.
- They didn't give the weapons back.

796
01:27:12,998 --> 01:27:14,196
They don't want to listen.

797
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:17,206
I'll make them listen my way.

798
01:27:20,296 --> 01:27:22,289
I'll take these guys and kill them.

799
01:27:25,551 --> 01:27:27,544
If you kill two kids,

800
01:27:27,636 --> 01:27:30,803
what shits will we look like
in the territory

801
01:27:30,889 --> 01:27:33,806
when people find out?.

802
01:27:33,892 --> 01:27:35,931
Are we joking?.

803
01:27:37,103 --> 01:27:41,314
Then the cops come,
we have to lay low for a month

804
01:27:42,149 --> 01:27:44,272
and all the traffic ends.

805
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:51,615
Zio Vittorio, they can't be
lording it around in my area,

806
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:55,744
they've already done so much,
I've warned them more than once.

807
01:27:55,828 --> 01:27:57,904
I can't consider them kids anymore.

808
01:27:58,914 --> 01:28:00,990
They have to die, that's final!

809
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:05,127
You're right,
but first let's tell the families.

810
01:28:05,212 --> 01:28:07,251
I don't know who they are.

811
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:12,424
Will you take care of it?.

812
01:28:12,552 --> 01:28:14,674
I'll handle it!

813
01:28:43,621 --> 01:28:44,866
Toto, is that you?.

814
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:54,254
- What happened to Silvana?.
- In the storeroom.

815
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,896
How come it's so dark?.

816
01:29:13,982 --> 01:29:16,021
Why are you in the dark?.

817
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:18,024
It's okay like this.

818
01:29:18,277 --> 01:29:20,186
Your change.

819
01:29:22,406 --> 01:29:25,442
- The bread?.
- There wasn't any.

820
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:28,570
- What'll we eat?.
- There's pasta.

821
01:29:31,706 --> 01:29:34,707
- Take your change.
- It's for you.

822
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,466
Why did you put her
in the storeroom?.

823
01:29:48,346 --> 01:29:50,385
She's fine where she is.

824
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:53,552
She's just an animal!

825
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:09,748
Come here a minute,
I have to talk to you.

826
01:31:11,754 --> 01:31:13,794
Don't come out, it's dangerous.

827
01:31:13,923 --> 01:31:16,046
Come on, no one can see you.

828
01:31:20,137 --> 01:31:22,176
What are you doing, you're going?.

829
01:31:25,433 --> 01:31:27,307
Listen to me!

830
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,477
They said I have to leave.

831
01:31:30,646 --> 01:31:32,722
I have to leave my house.

832
01:31:33,691 --> 01:31:35,730
I can't do anything.

833
01:31:35,817 --> 01:31:37,857
I'm not leaving!

834
01:31:38,904 --> 01:31:40,943
Come here a minute!

835
01:31:47,244 --> 01:31:50,447
Tell those friends of yours,
I'm not leaving!

836
01:31:52,374 --> 01:31:54,532
Tell those nice people!

837
01:31:54,626 --> 01:31:58,623
I won't betray my son
and I'm not moving from here!

838
01:32:00,757 --> 01:32:02,832
Not coming in for coffee?.

839
01:32:02,883 --> 01:32:04,840
Run off, run away!

840
01:32:45,547 --> 01:32:46,745
Hello, accountant.

841
01:32:47,674 --> 01:32:48,753
Please come in.

842
01:32:49,926 --> 01:32:53,010
Why this sudden call?.

843
01:32:53,846 --> 01:32:55,044
You're worrying me.

844
01:32:55,931 --> 01:32:58,054
The designers pay me after 60 days,

845
01:32:58,141 --> 01:33:00,264
I have a little money,

846
01:33:00,352 --> 01:33:03,222
but this wasn't the agreement.

847
01:33:03,313 --> 01:33:05,435
Money isn't the problem.

848
01:33:06,566 --> 01:33:08,523
What is it then?.

849
01:33:08,609 --> 01:33:10,602
It seems

850
01:33:11,695 --> 01:33:13,818
the problem is in your own house.

851
01:33:14,906 --> 01:33:16,899
In my house?.

852
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:19,031
What problem is it?.

853
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:22,154
One of your associates,

854
01:33:24,081 --> 01:33:25,196
Pasquale Del Prete,

855
01:33:25,332 --> 01:33:27,241
has sold out to the Chinese.

856
01:33:37,802 --> 01:33:39,759
We're done.

857
01:33:43,891 --> 01:33:45,089
The finishing touches...

858
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,440
I never doubted.

859
01:34:16,378 --> 01:34:18,335
Everything okay?.

860
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:24,716
Remember the first time
I put you to work in the factory?.

861
01:34:24,803 --> 01:34:26,795
You were just a kid.

862
01:34:28,931 --> 01:34:30,010
Right.

863
01:34:40,316 --> 01:34:42,475
- Everything alright?.
- Yes.

864
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:10,544
Tell him to go slower, not too fast.

865
01:35:25,107 --> 01:35:26,269
Well done, Giulia.

866
01:35:27,192 --> 01:35:28,306
She's good.

867
01:36:00,555 --> 01:36:02,631
In the morning I do Tai Chi.

868
01:36:02,724 --> 01:36:03,755
Really?.

869
01:36:04,642 --> 01:36:06,967
- It's nice.
- It is good for your health.

870
01:36:07,853 --> 01:36:09,976
It is like in China.

871
01:36:11,023 --> 01:36:15,103
When you go to the park
in the morning, it is full of people

872
01:36:16,278 --> 01:36:18,270
old people too.

873
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,356
All doing Tai Chi.

874
01:36:21,449 --> 01:36:22,611
Everyone

875
01:36:23,659 --> 01:36:26,576
Iikes the culture of Tai Chi.

876
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:30,905
It's a tradition of Chinese culture.

877
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:33,950
When will you do egg rolls for me?.

878
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:32,253
Wait up.

879
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:37,597
I spoke to the doctors,
you'll soon be released.

880
01:37:44,857 --> 01:37:46,896
Damn you,

881
01:37:47,026 --> 01:37:49,018
you really goofed up.

882
01:37:51,154 --> 01:37:55,199
They loved the models,
they've asked for more...

883
01:37:55,283 --> 01:37:57,276
You knew everything.

884
01:37:57,368 --> 01:37:59,527
That's how I saved your life.

885
01:38:00,538 --> 01:38:03,538
Those people don't kid around.

886
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:05,623
Leave me alone.

887
01:38:05,709 --> 01:38:09,789
You should thank me,
those guys will kill you.

888
01:38:09,838 --> 01:38:11,961
You and I pulled through.

889
01:38:12,048 --> 01:38:15,168
- Find another tailor.
- Why do you say that?.

890
01:38:16,052 --> 01:38:19,218
- I want to be alone.
- How can I do this without you?.

891
01:38:19,305 --> 01:38:21,297
I really don't care.

892
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:25,434
- After all I've done for you.
- What have you done for me?.

893
01:38:25,519 --> 01:38:28,722
I took you off the streets,
I fed you for years.

894
01:38:29,564 --> 01:38:32,683
-You've used me since I was a kid.
- Don't say that!

895
01:38:33,859 --> 01:38:37,109
When you're better,
come see me, I'll give you a raise.

896
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:43,195
Rosa, give me that bike,
I have to go.

897
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:14,065
No admittance here,

898
01:40:14,909 --> 01:40:16,106
that's it.

899
01:40:30,756 --> 01:40:32,795
Want to give up?.

900
01:40:33,675 --> 01:40:35,882
Are we meat for the slaughter house?.

901
01:40:45,102 --> 01:40:47,178
Let's shoot,
we'll rack up corpses too.

902
01:40:47,313 --> 01:40:48,427
Corpses?.

903
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:53,431
- I'm not moving without orders.
- What orders?.

904
01:40:53,568 --> 01:40:55,691
We don't know how to move.

905
01:40:57,780 --> 01:40:59,820
We don't know anything.

906
01:41:03,035 --> 01:41:05,952
Do we have to keep taking it?.

907
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:08,238
Do we have to wait for orders?.

908
01:41:11,376 --> 01:41:13,415
Let's rack up corpses.

909
01:41:13,503 --> 01:41:17,500
What are we waiting for,
to be put down one by one?.

910
01:41:21,635 --> 01:41:23,841
If we don't move, nothing will change

911
01:41:23,929 --> 01:41:26,005
No use feeling depressed.

912
01:41:27,974 --> 01:41:30,097
We all have to be convinced.

913
01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:33,138
But without orders, I'm not moving.

914
01:41:35,397 --> 01:41:37,437
This is open war,

915
01:41:38,275 --> 01:41:40,351
you mustn't think about anyone.

916
01:41:40,485 --> 01:41:43,652
- Who do we kill?.
- Let's begin in our area.

917
01:41:44,739 --> 01:41:46,815
From our own stronghold.

918
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:49,906
We don't know who's with us
and who's against us,

919
01:41:49,994 --> 01:41:52,070
who do we make pay?.

920
01:41:52,913 --> 01:41:56,080
Where do you think
the order to kill came from?.

921
01:41:56,166 --> 01:41:57,281
Think!

922
01:41:59,169 --> 01:42:01,208
Where did it come from?.

923
01:42:01,421 --> 01:42:04,375
- From there of course.
- From our own area.

924
01:42:04,465 --> 01:42:06,505
She betrayed us.

925
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,715
We don't touch women.

926
01:42:09,553 --> 01:42:10,716
Don't yell!

927
01:42:11,763 --> 01:42:13,839
What are you saying?.

928
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:21,140
Don't take it out on someone
no part of this, but the son.

929
01:42:21,272 --> 01:42:25,221
- How do we find him?.
- His mother's in our district.

930
01:42:25,276 --> 01:42:27,315
It was her son who killed Gaetano.

931
01:42:27,444 --> 01:42:29,484
Let's think what we'll do.

932
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:32,653
We could use the kid.

933
01:42:33,575 --> 01:42:35,697
He's the only one who can get to her.

934
01:42:36,869 --> 01:42:38,862
He brings her shopping,

935
01:42:38,955 --> 01:42:41,077
he's in good with the woman...

936
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:44,116
So, if we have to do it

937
01:42:44,209 --> 01:42:46,249
we'll need his help.

938
01:42:49,214 --> 01:42:51,290
Toto, what do you think you'll do?.

939
01:42:52,467 --> 01:42:54,589
Are you with us or against us?.

940
01:43:01,725 --> 01:43:03,764
What do you say?.

941
01:43:04,978 --> 01:43:07,054
Are you with us or not?.

942
01:43:09,023 --> 01:43:12,107
- We'll see what we can do.
- No, "we'll see".

943
01:43:12,193 --> 01:43:14,315
Either you're with us
or you're against us,

944
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,360
one or the other.

945
01:43:17,406 --> 01:43:21,533
If you're against us you can't leave,
we can't trust you.

946
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:23,776
It can't have been her.

947
01:43:24,746 --> 01:43:26,785
This is our decision,

948
01:43:26,873 --> 01:43:28,912
you have to be with us.

949
01:43:28,999 --> 01:43:32,119
That's what we say,
you don't need to think.

950
01:43:37,257 --> 01:43:39,296
What are you going to do?.

951
01:43:40,385 --> 01:43:43,551
- We'll see.
- I said no "we'll see".

952
01:44:00,111 --> 01:44:01,225
Come on down.

953
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,359
I have to tell you something!

954
01:44:05,407 --> 01:44:07,364
No, come down!

955
01:44:08,535 --> 01:44:10,658
Hurry, I have to leave!

956
01:45:51,753 --> 01:45:52,867
Sit down!

957
01:46:31,372 --> 01:46:33,411
You've known me for years,

958
01:46:33,498 --> 01:46:35,621
you know what I've always done.

959
01:46:37,627 --> 01:46:39,584
I brought the money.

960
01:46:39,671 --> 01:46:41,793
I brought it to your family too.

961
01:46:43,841 --> 01:46:45,964
I did it because I was ordered to.

962
01:46:51,139 --> 01:46:53,215
War isn't for me.

963
01:46:53,391 --> 01:46:56,345
But you're in it, know that?.

964
01:46:58,479 --> 01:46:59,558
Yes.

965
01:46:59,647 --> 01:47:01,520
So?.

966
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:03,599
You tell me.

967
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,643
What can I tell you?.

968
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:11,948
What did you come here for?.

969
01:47:14,035 --> 01:47:15,233
To talk to you.

970
01:47:16,162 --> 01:47:17,324
About what?.

971
01:47:21,375 --> 01:47:23,414
I want to save myself.

972
01:47:23,502 --> 01:47:25,660
You'll have to buy your life,

973
01:47:26,546 --> 01:47:28,585
I won't give it to you.

974
01:47:32,968 --> 01:47:35,008
What I did there,

975
01:47:36,055 --> 01:47:38,130
I can do for you here.

976
01:47:39,057 --> 01:47:41,180
We don't need money-carriers,

977
01:47:41,226 --> 01:47:44,429
we have to score,
kill people, and we need money.

978
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:47,472
You're wasting your time.

979
01:47:50,693 --> 01:47:52,685
You're more dead than alive.

980
01:47:52,778 --> 01:47:55,779
But we were brothers before.

981
01:47:55,864 --> 01:47:56,895
Before!

982
01:47:56,990 --> 01:48:00,026
Then they started
messing around with shit.

983
01:48:05,164 --> 01:48:07,287
Our relatives were good people...

984
01:48:08,292 --> 01:48:10,415
so they killed them!

985
01:48:12,462 --> 01:48:13,625
So, don't come asking

986
01:48:14,506 --> 01:48:15,704
to pass to the other side.

987
01:48:16,591 --> 01:48:18,714
We have to score, kill,

988
01:48:18,801 --> 01:48:20,841
and we need money.

989
01:48:21,804 --> 01:48:23,002
If not, you die,

990
01:48:23,889 --> 01:48:25,965
because you're part of the war.

991
01:48:26,016 --> 01:48:28,092
You bring money and I kill people,

992
01:48:28,226 --> 01:48:31,180
we're the same, you and me,
in this war.

993
01:48:32,355 --> 01:48:34,431
- I understand.
- You understand.

994
01:48:45,784 --> 01:48:46,982
Wait a moment.

995
01:49:18,313 --> 01:49:20,305
Everything okay?.

996
01:49:22,483 --> 01:49:24,440
And you?.

997
01:49:31,783 --> 01:49:33,740
That's four.

998
01:49:44,336 --> 01:49:46,376
Face on the table!

999
01:49:47,256 --> 01:49:48,501
Done?.

1000
01:49:49,508 --> 01:49:50,587
Let's go!

1001
01:49:58,891 --> 01:50:00,800
Come on out!

1002
01:50:01,018 --> 01:50:03,057
Lucky, eh?.

1003
01:51:29,556 --> 01:51:31,595
That's poison.

1004
01:51:32,809 --> 01:51:34,885
What'd he say?.

1005
01:51:35,728 --> 01:51:38,978
My father wants to say the dumping
you're doing on our land

1006
01:51:39,857 --> 01:51:41,055
isn't garbage.

1007
01:51:41,942 --> 01:51:43,140
It's poison.

1008
01:51:43,235 --> 01:51:45,274
It's not garbage?.

1009
01:51:47,197 --> 01:51:48,442
You heard right.

1010
01:51:49,282 --> 01:51:50,480
Don't worry.

1011
01:51:51,367 --> 01:51:54,534
A year's gone by with this dumping?.

1012
01:51:55,704 --> 01:51:58,740
So far,
all we've done is pay our debts.

1013
01:51:59,875 --> 01:52:00,954
Just barely.

1014
01:52:01,793 --> 01:52:05,078
- Euro.
- I understand, Don Raffaele.

1015
01:52:08,090 --> 01:52:10,297
Everything costs double in euro.

1016
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,375
And so?.

1017
01:52:14,263 --> 01:52:15,543
We need something more.

1018
01:52:17,516 --> 01:52:20,552
These are the prices,
explain it to your kids,

1019
01:52:20,643 --> 01:52:23,727
if I do it for you,
I have to do it for everyone.

1020
01:52:23,813 --> 01:52:25,852
Don't put me
in a difficult situation.

1021
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:29,984
Okay, if you give us more,
everyone has to get more.

1022
01:52:30,027 --> 01:52:32,066
So, little can be done.

1023
01:52:32,154 --> 01:52:34,312
But, we barely make ends meet,

1024
01:52:35,156 --> 01:52:37,279
we can't go on like this.

1025
01:52:37,367 --> 01:52:39,406
We were thinking,

1026
01:52:40,536 --> 01:52:43,620
is it possible to do more dumping?.

1027
01:52:45,749 --> 01:52:47,658
Euro...

1028
01:52:47,835 --> 01:52:49,910
More dumping?.

1029
01:52:50,795 --> 01:52:53,880
We have another piece of land
for other dumping sites.

1030
01:52:53,965 --> 01:52:55,163
Near here?.

1031
01:52:56,134 --> 01:52:58,091
Around here.

1032
01:52:58,135 --> 01:53:00,175
More dumping we do,

1033
01:53:00,304 --> 01:53:02,380
faster the ground gets filled.

1034
01:53:02,473 --> 01:53:05,390
You have another piece of land?.

1035
01:53:06,435 --> 01:53:08,676
- Near here?.
- Further on.

1036
01:53:09,562 --> 01:53:12,682
This other land
would be more convenient,

1037
01:53:12,732 --> 01:53:15,851
it's bigger and trucks
can get in easier.

1038
01:53:17,027 --> 01:53:18,901
But...

1039
01:53:20,989 --> 01:53:23,065
Still 100 euros per dumping.

1040
01:53:23,158 --> 01:53:25,197
What do you mean 100 euros!

1041
01:53:25,326 --> 01:53:27,366
Don't speak out of turn.

1042
01:53:27,412 --> 01:53:29,488
- He can't increase!
- Who said so?.

1043
01:53:30,414 --> 01:53:32,490
We'll increase the trucks.

1044
01:53:33,626 --> 01:53:36,792
You have to increase
the price of each dumping.

1045
01:53:37,879 --> 01:53:39,836
Want to lose everything?.

1046
01:53:39,923 --> 01:53:42,046
They have nowhere else to turn.

1047
01:53:42,884 --> 01:53:43,963
Excuse me.

1048
01:53:44,052 --> 01:53:46,009
Don't worry.

1049
01:53:47,305 --> 01:53:49,344
Alright, now we'll reach...

1050
01:53:54,478 --> 01:53:56,470
an agreement.

1051
01:53:56,563 --> 01:53:58,686
Give him a glass of water.

1052
01:53:58,773 --> 01:54:00,849
I'll do it, don't worry.

1053
01:54:11,076 --> 01:54:12,155
Luca!

1054
01:54:19,542 --> 01:54:21,665
You have to clean up this field!

1055
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:24,579
I'm not Luca.

1056
01:54:24,713 --> 01:54:26,752
Do a little work.

1057
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:28,832
My name's Roberto.

1058
01:54:31,010 --> 01:54:33,133
This field is such a mess.

1059
01:54:34,138 --> 01:54:36,095
All such a mess.

1060
01:54:37,183 --> 01:54:38,381
Ma'am, it's raining.

1061
01:54:40,227 --> 01:54:41,390
Should I stop?.

1062
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:43,512
Come out of there.

1063
01:54:46,524 --> 01:54:48,564
I'll take you inside.

1064
01:54:48,818 --> 01:54:50,775
I'll be right along.

1065
01:54:50,903 --> 01:54:52,943
They've made ditches here,

1066
01:54:53,823 --> 01:54:55,898
someone should come

1067
01:54:55,991 --> 01:54:58,031
to fill them.

1068
01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:12,668
Let's go!

1069
01:55:25,226 --> 01:55:27,218
What beautiful peaches, thank you!

1070
01:55:27,311 --> 01:55:29,350
I'll take them to the kids.

1071
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:31,519
See how beautiful they are!

1072
01:55:32,607 --> 01:55:34,516
Let's go.

1073
01:55:34,693 --> 01:55:36,732
Put them in the car.

1074
01:55:36,778 --> 01:55:38,651
Come on!

1075
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:54,289
Toss that stuff.

1076
01:55:54,377 --> 01:55:56,500
- What?.
- The peaches.

1077
01:55:56,587 --> 01:55:58,663
Can't you smell how they stink?.

1078
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,598
Done?.

1079
01:56:39,292 --> 01:56:40,371
What?.

1080
01:56:41,211 --> 01:56:42,290
Listen,

1081
01:56:43,338 --> 01:56:45,377
I've been thinking.

1082
01:56:46,465 --> 01:56:48,624
Maybe I'm not cut out for this work.

1083
01:56:48,717 --> 01:56:50,626
What?.

1084
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:52,676
I mean it.

1085
01:56:53,847 --> 01:56:55,886
I'm not up to it.

1086
01:56:55,974 --> 01:56:58,097
We're doing so well!

1087
01:56:59,936 --> 01:57:01,015
No,

1088
01:57:02,063 --> 01:57:03,308
I don't want to work anymore,

1089
01:57:04,148 --> 01:57:05,263
I'm sorry.

1090
01:57:12,489 --> 01:57:14,565
Think this job sucks?.

1091
01:57:14,657 --> 01:57:18,821
You know that guys like me
put this shit country in Europe?.

1092
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:22,036
Know how many workers I've helped
by saving their companies money?.

1093
01:57:22,915 --> 01:57:24,077
Stop and look!

1094
01:57:25,209 --> 01:57:27,201
What do you see?.

1095
01:57:29,254 --> 01:57:30,368
Debts.

1096
01:57:31,256 --> 01:57:34,340
All these people have been saved
only thanks to us.

1097
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:38,586
I saw how you help them live.

1098
01:57:38,721 --> 01:57:41,805
You save a worker in Mestre
and kill a family in Mondragone.

1099
01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:44,844
That's how it works,
but I didn't decide it.

1100
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:48,052
We solve problems created by others.

1101
01:57:49,063 --> 01:57:51,139
I didn't create
chromium and asbestos,

1102
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:53,266
I didn't dig up the mountain.

1103
01:57:54,193 --> 01:57:55,438
That's how it works?.

1104
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,359
I don't work that way.

1105
01:57:59,364 --> 01:58:00,609
I'm not like you.

1106
01:58:01,491 --> 01:58:03,697
- What are you like?.
- I'm different.

1107
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:09,911
Go make pizzas!

1108
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:11,997
He's different.

1109
01:58:15,045 --> 01:58:17,203
Don't think you're better than me!

1110
01:58:18,298 --> 01:58:20,374
I gave you a chance!

1111
01:58:23,386 --> 01:58:24,548
Go fuck yourself!

1112
01:59:24,983 --> 01:59:28,186
I think Scarlett Johansson's here!

1113
01:59:29,195 --> 01:59:31,152
Splendid, magnificent,

1114
01:59:32,281 --> 01:59:34,404
all dressed in white,

1115
01:59:36,493 --> 01:59:37,608
cream.

1116
01:59:38,495 --> 01:59:40,571
In style with the film.

1117
01:59:41,706 --> 01:59:44,872
Right colors,
right choice of dress.

1118
01:59:46,794 --> 01:59:50,079
It would be nice to know
why it took so long to get ready...

1119
01:59:53,008 --> 01:59:54,253
Because it's chic

1120
01:59:56,177 --> 01:59:58,217
yet so sophisticated.

1121
01:59:58,304 --> 02:00:02,515
An apparent simplicity,
but in reality, very elaborate...

1122
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,592
Allow me to say...

1123
02:00:04,685 --> 02:00:08,765
Maybe to be awaited as a true star.

1124
02:00:08,814 --> 02:00:10,890
She's a star, and so beautiful.

1125
02:00:13,026 --> 02:00:15,149
The photographers are going crazy.

1126
02:00:17,238 --> 02:00:19,230
And the people too...

1127
02:01:27,009 --> 02:01:29,167
May I sit at your table?.

1128
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:38,350
- Can I offer you a cigarette?.
- We don't smoke.

1129
02:01:40,521 --> 02:01:42,560
Everyone here talks about you.

1130
02:01:43,607 --> 02:01:45,813
You kids have balls, I can use you.

1131
02:01:47,736 --> 02:01:49,978
Why don't you join my guys?.

1132
02:01:51,031 --> 02:01:53,070
You'll have money, motorbikes,

1133
02:01:53,157 --> 02:01:55,197
anything you want.

1134
02:01:56,077 --> 02:01:58,153
I already saved you once,

1135
02:01:58,204 --> 02:02:00,326
because here
they don't like you guys.

1136
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:03,412
You're causing too much trouble.

1137
02:02:04,418 --> 02:02:06,493
It's wise to be with me,

1138
02:02:06,544 --> 02:02:08,584
that way you don't have to worry,
you're covered.

1139
02:02:09,756 --> 02:02:11,831
We want to stay alone,

1140
02:02:11,924 --> 02:02:14,795
we don't want to be under anyone.

1141
02:02:14,969 --> 02:02:17,091
We don't like to be under people.

1142
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:20,137
We're just for us, that's all.

1143
02:02:22,267 --> 02:02:24,390
May I confide in you?.

1144
02:02:25,270 --> 02:02:27,511
It's obvious you're courageous.

1145
02:02:28,397 --> 02:02:30,520
You're not talking to cops.

1146
02:02:31,650 --> 02:02:32,729
What is it?.

1147
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:37,738
I have a good job for you
and you'll earn a barrel of money.

1148
02:02:37,823 --> 02:02:40,029
- Money?.
- Money's the first thing.

1149
02:02:40,867 --> 02:02:42,029
We know.

1150
02:02:44,203 --> 02:02:47,323
- May I come closer?.
- Sure.

1151
02:02:47,373 --> 02:02:50,409
It's something not to be overheard,
just between us.

1152
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:53,536
I need a big favor,

1153
02:02:53,628 --> 02:02:55,668
you could do a "job" for me.

1154
02:02:56,548 --> 02:02:58,670
I see you've got balls,

1155
02:02:58,841 --> 02:03:02,839
but this guy's a hot one, he's big.

1156
02:03:03,846 --> 02:03:06,088
We really like these things.

1157
02:03:06,974 --> 02:03:08,136
I'm crazy for them.

1158
02:03:09,059 --> 02:03:11,217
You have to kill Peppe the Horseman.

1159
02:03:11,311 --> 02:03:14,265
He's a traitor, he took my woman.

1160
02:03:17,441 --> 02:03:18,639
You have to shoot him in the balls

1161
02:03:19,485 --> 02:03:21,524
and then in the mouth.

1162
02:03:21,654 --> 02:03:23,776
I go crazy for these things.

1163
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:26,815
But you have to do me a favor.

1164
02:03:27,993 --> 02:03:32,120
They told me you
stole some weapons from around here.

1165
02:03:34,081 --> 02:03:36,370
You have to give them back,
we gotta make them disappear.

1166
02:03:37,209 --> 02:03:39,415
- I'll give you the weapons.
- You will?.

1167
02:03:39,503 --> 02:03:42,539
Weapons, motorbikes,
anything you want.

1168
02:03:42,631 --> 02:03:44,670
Let's talk about the money.

1169
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:48,634
Tell me what you want
for this job.

1170
02:03:48,803 --> 02:03:50,842
A really good amount.

1171
02:03:50,972 --> 02:03:53,842
Is 10,000 euro enough?.

1172
02:03:56,059 --> 02:03:57,139
Yes.

1173
02:03:57,227 --> 02:04:00,263
I'll give you an advance,
the rest when the job's done.

1174
02:04:10,739 --> 02:04:12,732
Put it in your pocket.

1175
02:04:13,825 --> 02:04:16,826
- Is it right?.
- Fine.

1176
02:05:48,744 --> 02:05:50,736
- Not there.
- Then where?.

1177
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:54,950
- Where the fuck do we go?.
- Who knows where he went!

1178
02:05:57,961 --> 02:06:00,167
- We lost him.
- Are you sure?.

1179
02:06:02,339 --> 02:06:05,376
- Look over there.
- There's nothin'.

1180
02:06:07,553 --> 02:06:09,462
Then where?.

1181
02:06:10,555 --> 02:06:11,718
There he is!

1182
02:08:02,155 --> 02:08:04,064
Get off.

1183
02:08:18,795 --> 02:08:19,910
Come on!

1184
02:09:24,604 --> 02:09:27,605
For two kids such a waste of time.

1185
02:09:27,691 --> 02:09:29,683
Guys, it had to be done.

1186
02:09:29,776 --> 02:09:31,768
Everything's okay.

1187
02:11:22,377 --> 02:11:25,543
In Europe the Camorra has killed more
than all other criminal organizations

1188
02:11:26,422 --> 02:11:29,542
4,000 deaths in the last thirty years
One every three days.

1189
02:11:29,717 --> 02:11:33,666
Scampia is the biggest
drug-pushing locality in the world.

1190
02:11:33,762 --> 02:11:36,882
Daily sales per clan
run about 500,000 euro.

1191
02:11:37,849 --> 02:11:41,015
If clan-managed waste were piled
it would reach 14,600 meters.

1192
02:11:41,102 --> 02:11:43,141
Everest is 8,850 meters.

1193
02:11:43,229 --> 02:11:46,265
There is a 20/ increase in cancer
in the poisoned areas.

1194
02:11:47,232 --> 02:11:51,444
Gains from illegal activities are
reinvested in legal ones worldwide.

1195
02:11:51,528 --> 02:11:55,656
The Camorra has also invested in the
reconstruction of the Twin Towers.
