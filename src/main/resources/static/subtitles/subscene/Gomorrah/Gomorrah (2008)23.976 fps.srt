1
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,010
How long you gonna be?

2
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,938
Be right out,

3
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,150
you're a pain!

4
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,219
Hey, American.

5
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,972
I'm still here, gettin' a manicure.

6
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,018
Things okay?

7
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,396
Gettin' tanned? Don't get burned!

8
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,148
Bruno's here too.

9
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,108
You got a crap body!

10
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,862
Is Bruno here?

11
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,614
He's over there.

12
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,539
You doin' a lamp?

13
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,152
It's 2,000.

14
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,530
How much are you
supposed to get this week?

15
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,490
9,200.

16
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,784
Sure? It was less last week.

17
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,664
Yes, Don Ciro, 9,200.

18
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,584
Another 2,000 euro and we're even.

19
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,546
Don Ciro, don't take all day.

20
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,214
He's slow.

21
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,968
Hurry, so we can go home.

22
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,388
Things okay out there?

23
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,974
Keep your eyes open.

24
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,652
That's it.

25
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,826
Put paper cups in.

26
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,000
Toilet paper.

27
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,259
- Then, Mom?
- Some shampoo.

28
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,971
A mozzarella..

29
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,771
Shampoo, not bath oil!

30
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,481
You're rushin' me!

31
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,359
And you're drivin' me crazy!

32
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,116
Hurry up, there are
more groceries to deliver.

33
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,619
- Nothing else?
- No.

34
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,293
- Be back later.
- Don't get yourself lost.

35
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,432
- Simone.
- Totò, what's up?

36
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,976
- What's happening?
- I'm workin'.

37
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,357
Know what happened?
They arrested Vitale and Bon Bon.

38
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,900
Really?

39
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,404
- Got somethin' to eat?
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

40
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,407
Bye, see you.

41
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,091
Carmela, ma'am!

42
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,057
Hi, Boxer.

43
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,378
Two doses, two doses!

44
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,881
Please, give me a dose!

45
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,847
Gaetano, check it!

46
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,427
One, two, three..

47
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,057
Goodbye.

48
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,852
Don Ciro, be more punctual.

49
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,187
I'll pass it on.

50
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,822
Eleven and twelve.

51
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,991
See if he wants coffee.

52
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,494
No, but thank you anyway..

53
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,329
I'll show you out.

54
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,374
Have a good day.

55
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,300
Four hundred..

56
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,764
Five hundred.

57
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,309
The same amount again?

58
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,397
I've said a hundred times
I can't manage like this.

59
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,982
Don Carlo..

60
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:34,322
Did you tell them I can't manage
on this chickenfeed?

61
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,242
I have to pay rent, lights, water.

62
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,079
I can't survive,
I'm strapped with debts.

63
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,583
- I'll pass it on.
- You always say that!

64
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,128
Are you mockin' me?

65
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,088
I don't get it!

66
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,465
Listen,

67
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,426
I've got a son to support,

68
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:58,847
for forty years
I've kept him off the streets,

69
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,391
he's unemployed.

70
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,103
What can I do,
go over to the other side?

71
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:09,774
They know, I served you honestly
for forty years.

72
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,194
My wife's in jail,
is this the thanks we get?

73
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,780
Are we crazy?
Do I have to raise hell?

74
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,578
Silvana!

75
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,254
May I?

76
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,300
Come on in!

77
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,551
Maria!

78
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,430
The bill?

79
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,556
Talk to Mom.

80
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,899
Put this in your pocket.

81
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,360
Thank you.

82
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,209
Carabinieri on the street!

83
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,389
He's comin' out!

84
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,992
I'm the best, number one!

85
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,370
So?

86
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,496
Go, Marco!

87
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,125
- I'll blast these roaches!
- Who do you think you're fighting?

88
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,879
I'm number one! Tony Montana!

89
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,507
The world is ours!

90
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,884
You don't know
who you're up against!

91
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,970
I'm Tony Montana!

92
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,265
- I'm the powerhouse!
- Yeah!

93
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,766
Come here.

94
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,936
Shit Colombians,

95
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,813
they're everywhere.

96
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,025
See, Colombians everywhere.

97
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,531
You really looked like Scarface.

98
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,960
You were good.

99
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,881
Now it all has to be ours,
the whole world.

100
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,716
Miami, all of it.

101
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,525
My friend, got stuff?

102
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,952
You got stuff?

103
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,794
- Got good stuff?
- You got money?

104
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,215
- Sure, you got coke?
- What do you want to pay?

105
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,258
Me? 50.

106
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:29,182
- 55, can you do it?
- No, 55 is too much, 50.

107
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,559
You sure?

108
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,478
Wait here for me.

109
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,197
Where's Smarty?

110
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,884
Hey, kid!

111
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,232
Give him the money.

112
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,657
- Is it all here?
- Yeah.

113
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,426
- Okay?
- Yes.

114
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,515
- Want to see it?
- I want to try it.

115
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,686
I gave you the money!

116
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,229
Wait!

117
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,612
Open your hand.

118
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,783
It's good.

119
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,663
Give me all of it!

120
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,673
Grab the money!

121
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,204
Giovanni, I brought the kids.

122
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,914
Come in.

123
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,421
You know very well why you're here.

124
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,425
Too much ruckus going on in my area,
because I'm the boss here.

125
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,469
That's just you sayin'.

126
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,723
If I had you come here, I know.
No back-talk

127
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,934
or I'll smash your face!

128
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,813
- What happened?
- For the moment, nothing.

129
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,149
Get me?

130
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,319
I can't be made to look bad
because of two kids like you.

131
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,824
The next time
I hear anything about you,

132
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,784
I'll blow your heads off.

133
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,954
- If it's like you say..
- Shut up when I'm talkin'.

134
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,416
Then if I come to realize

135
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,002
you're worth something,

136
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,005
which I'll determine and I'll decide,

137
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,590
you can work for me.

138
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,091
Is that clear?

139
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,429
Show them out.

140
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,063
"I'll smash your face!"

141
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,981
And I'll tear your beard!

142
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,692
Without a T-shirt.

143
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,279
"Sweet Pea", looked like a bum.

144
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,239
A real bum.

145
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,076
He is a bum! Did you see
who he sent to get us?

146
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,621
If that guy's the boss here,

147
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,707
then here we can be the bosses.

148
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:10,379
If a guy like him is boss here,
this area is ours!

149
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,508
I'll live for 30 years
if he's boss here.

150
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,843
Sure, because he's a retard!

151
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,765
Get it? I'll live for 30 years.

152
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,559
But he could at least shave!

153
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,062
Shave!

154
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,772
"I'll smash your face!"

155
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,776
Let's go have a snort to spite him.

156
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,071
We've got everything,
we can do like we want.

157
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,202
Anyway, he's a fat shit-ass.

158
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,454
He bugged you?

159
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,623
He showers once a week!

160
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,547
"I'll blow your heads off!"

161
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,531
Roberto!

162
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,918
Let's go, it's too small.

163
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:35,381
- But the methane one's big.
- No, it's small.

164
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,510
- Can I finish measuring?
- No, we're wasting time.

165
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,309
- I have to take some shots.
- What a bore with these pictures!

166
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,643
Let's go!

167
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,484
Just look at this.

168
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,779
It's disgusting down there.

169
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,165
Here is perfect.

170
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,751
It's perfect.

171
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,796
We're near the highway,
the trucks can get really close,

172
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,133
they dump the earth
and cover all the water.

173
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,302
Perfect.

174
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,223
Franco, it's 85 meters.

175
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,933
Get the length too.

176
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,480
Come here.

177
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,150
Dante..

178
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,237
Hello, everything okay?

179
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,365
This is Roberto.

180
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,996
- It's time we made room for youth.
- We need new energy.

181
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,831
Take a few more shots.

182
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,835
Did you hear?

183
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,837
They bombed me,

184
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,881
at the cement plant.

185
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,969
A whole wall came down,

186
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,553
slowly.

187
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,514
Be careful.

188
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,557
Zio resolved it.

189
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,396
I'd forgotten to pay
for some land I'd bought.

190
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,731
- An injunction against payment?
- Yeah!

191
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,567
- What do you think?
- It's fine.

192
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,529
- Can we fill this quarry?
- Sure can.

193
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,573
Tell Zio it's fine.

194
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,705
Remember, everything clean:
Terracing, solid stuff..

195
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,833
Or the redevelopment agency
will break our balls.

196
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:39,630
Don't worry,
you emptied it and I'll fill it.

197
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:52,143
All the pieces have to be cut
and the sizes worked out.

198
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,688
They want 120 of these.

199
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,202
Six and seven are identical.

200
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,459
Here the satin is cut on the bias.

201
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,377
It's all hand-hemmed.

202
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,628
Is it tough?

203
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,841
The models aren't hard,
I can do it.

204
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,763
Eight hundred items in two months,
is our request.

205
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,267
Keep in mind
we start at 50 euros per item.

206
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,063
You've seen the models,
the price is good,

207
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,524
estimate and make your offers.

208
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,903
Thirty euro, 30 days?

209
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,113
Don't go any lower.

210
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,116
This is high fashion,
it's not prèt-à-porter.

211
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,660
Forty-five, in two months.

212
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,373
- Ms. Zamarion!
- Yes?

213
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,375
Thirty-eight, forty.

214
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,127
That's a very interesting proposal.

215
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,505
Thirty-five, thirty-five,

216
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,133
excellent workmanship
and delivery times respected.

217
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,344
Thirty, thirty!

218
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,312
Please,

219
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,023
we're not imposing anything!

220
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,985
Did we say thirty, thirty?

221
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,987
At this point

222
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,407
twenty-eight, thirty!

223
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,122
Thirty, twenty-five!

224
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,709
I can't lose this bid.

225
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,587
Come here, there's some bubbly!

226
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,550
Are they coming?

227
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,302
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

228
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,100
Five days less for delivery,

229
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,019
we'll have to work overtime,
and I'll do nights..

230
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,771
What's odd about that?

231
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,274
They're talking overtime pay.

232
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,526
They'll get it!

233
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,238
Am I scared of a little overtime?

234
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,491
Like the last time?

235
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,994
Don't worry,
this time it's a sure thing.

236
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,625
- They've lost their trust.
- I know.

237
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:26,046
- I asked you to talk to them.
- You do it, please.

238
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,633
You're on closer terms,
they respect you.

239
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,260
Do me this favor.

240
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,598
Don't say no, go talk to them.

241
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,267
You know I'm fond of you,

242
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,060
I'll have to make
a gold statue to you!

243
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,771
I'll go down and see the accountant
for the money.

244
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,572
Sorry, how much is this?

245
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,616
Ten thousand.

246
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:58,370
It's not enough, I need more.

247
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,414
Twice that at least.

248
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,501
Mr. Enzo,
you're already "complicated".

249
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,754
Yes, but for personal affairs.
I need this for work.

250
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,966
I'll give it back in three months.

251
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,843
But this isn't enough.

252
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,847
If you don't need it
and it's not enough,

253
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,307
I'll take it back.

254
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,267
It's best for you.

255
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,562
Don't be like that, listen,

256
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,190
I need at least double!

257
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,775
It's no risk,

258
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,610
you'll earn from it, right?

259
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,153
What can I say?

260
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,073
I'll pass it on,
can you make-do for now?

261
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,742
Yes, I'll take it.

262
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,964
Congratulations, Mr. Pasquale.

263
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,298
Thank you.

264
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,801
We met yesterday.

265
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,556
I need your help.

266
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,982
I'm having trouble with work.

267
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,612
I have to get into
haute couture right away,

268
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,325
but for me it is very difficult.

269
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,954
I need help.

270
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,375
You are

271
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,128
a great master,

272
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,172
you are very important for me.

273
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,593
You teach ten lessons

274
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,470
to workers in my factory.

275
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,683
I pay you in cash,

276
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,728
2,000 euros a lesson

277
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,355
for ten lessons.

278
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,610
We work together,
but no one knows it,

279
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,903
just the two of us.

280
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,449
I need your help.

281
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,785
Think it over.

282
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,084
- What's the cloth like?
- Come and see.

283
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,622
I've got nothin'!

284
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,168
Don't move!

285
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,151
They must have gone over to his side,

286
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,362
or they'd have arrested me first
and then those other guys.

287
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,741
Believe me? All of them were there
when I called you.

288
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,660
I said: "Check out this car,
it's suspect."

289
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,370
This stuff here is ours.

290
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,789
My gun!

291
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,295
Check this stuff out,
there should be fifty-six.

292
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:23,594
Good, Totò, this is for you.

293
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,389
How can I get working with you?

294
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,850
We'll let you know.

295
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,271
- Did you turn off the water?
- Of course!

296
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,233
- Can I help out?
- No, you'll get wet.

297
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,443
Doesn't matter!

298
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,779
Come and see.

299
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,448
Careful not to slip.

300
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:50,496
- Is it coming from the well?
- No, I think it's from the pipe.

301
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,041
Careful, water's coming in.

302
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,585
See if you can close it.

303
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,130
It's closed,
but it's the pipe that..

304
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,305
I'd give you a hand, but..

305
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,391
What a great day!

306
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,310
Push it all in one direction.

307
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,820
I thought I'd be having coffee!

308
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,573
- Nice coffee, huh?
- I'll have some next time.

309
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,458
Totore, things okay?

310
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,505
- Can I say hi?
- No, you gotta leave.

311
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,966
Go down with these bags!

312
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,719
You have to move!

313
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,472
Ma'am, go around the other way.

314
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,183
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine, leave.

315
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,914
Lucia?

316
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,573
Come closer.

317
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,784
- What's your name?
- Luigi.

318
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,205
- Are you scared?
- No.

319
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,874
- Sure?
- No.

320
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,126
We'll see.

321
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:06,548
- Are you strong?
- Yeah!

322
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,634
Let's see how strong you are.

323
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,932
Why are you shaking?

324
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,809
No?

325
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,231
- See how strong this kid is.
- Come closer!

326
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,990
- Are you scared?
- Yes.

327
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,260
Now you're a man.

328
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,698
Nothin'! Everything's okay!

329
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,953
When I did my piercing,
I got an infection.

330
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,830
Let's see.

331
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,500
You went and did it there?

332
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,921
- I'd like to have it on my eyebrow.
- Stinks.

333
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,965
It's nicer there, you're right.

334
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,386
It's gonna rain.

335
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,681
Everything's okay!

336
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,062
A car's coming!

337
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,816
It went in!

338
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,570
It's going in!

339
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,157
Check out this other one!

340
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,327
Everything's okay!

341
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,447
Sorry I'm late, the Councilman,
City Hall, the traffic..

342
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,034
- My father.
- How do you do.

343
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,539
I'm glad he's with you
you're a good person.

344
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,792
He's in your care.

345
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,337
He's a clever guy.

346
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,840
I don't doubt that, but..

347
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,134
- Having work is important to him.
- Of course.

348
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,678
I tried so hard
to find him work in Naples..

349
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,849
- Where do you work?
- In the hospital, intensive care.

350
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,644
A bad division.

351
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:15,523
I tried to get him in,
but I have no connections.

352
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,777
He's all set now.

353
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,112
You did something no one else did.

354
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,823
I thank you, you raised him well.

355
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,867
Have you always worked in Naples?

356
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,745
No, also in Trieste, Udine,

357
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,831
Venice..
that's where we're going.

358
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,584
I told him about Venice.

359
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,255
He's excited, it's his first time.

360
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:42,008
Dad, we have a plane.

361
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,137
Did you bring some things?

362
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,266
What's that, your gym bag?

363
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,852
- Goodbye.
- He's in your care.

364
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,543
- What do you pay for disposal?
- Today I'm paying 50.

365
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,086
Your offer?

366
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,547
We can halve your costs,

367
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,340
25 cents a kilo.

368
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,092
That's good,

369
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,387
but is it all "clean",
like they say in the United States?

370
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,972
Since it's toxic waste,

371
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,558
certification,
storage and transportation.

372
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,356
- Is there a contract to look over?
- Of course.

373
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,653
In case you're wondering,

374
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,739
the disposal cycle

375
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,241
goes to the disposal area
in Marcianise.

376
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,827
I'm telling you in fairness.

377
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,122
Thank you for the information,

378
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,708
but my only concern
is that it's "clean".

379
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,127
You can rest assured of that.

380
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,465
We can dispose of all the waste
that you produce in a year.

381
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,883
Eight hundred tons.

382
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,426
Exactly.

383
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,845
It's not a problem.

384
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,138
That's a lot.

385
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,311
My concern is disposal.

386
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,106
We serve various companies,
you can check.

387
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,276
I already have!

388
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,278
Don't worry.

389
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,949
As far as I can see,
there's maximum transparency.

390
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,326
Absolutely.

391
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,624
- The warehouses at Teverola?
- We use them for tires.

392
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,958
Exactly.

393
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,753
Will we put the tannery waste
in the quarry?

394
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,506
- Don't talk foolishness.
- Where then?

395
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,841
Check the European catalogue.

396
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,013
Here they are, 04.

397
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,183
The ones in red,
are among the most dangerous.

398
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,187
"Exhausted degreasing baths
with solvents, no liquid phase."

399
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,814
No, no good.

400
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,776
Then 4-11:

401
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,363
"Waste containing halogenated
compounds from operations"

402
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,532
"of manufacturing and finishing."

403
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,908
These are good.

404
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,453
It's stuff the earth absorbs,
we'll mix it with compost.

405
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,540
Fertilizer!

406
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,294
All that leaves is
Milan's sweeping refuse,

407
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,879
that's 60 trucks.

408
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,676
- The quarries at San Felice?
- They're too small.

409
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,720
I don't think so, look.

410
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,013
Let me see.

411
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,857
They're too small
and they're shallow,

412
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,483
they're no good.

413
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,665
Yes.. I've got
ten contracts out of ten.

414
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,713
Is he near you?

415
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,717
Put him on.

416
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,052
I'll talk to him.

417
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,204
I told him, everything's okay.

418
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,595
- Do you like traveling?
- Sure!

419
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,764
We'll take more trips.

420
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,817
Everyone here works in boats?

421
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,029
Everyone, firemen, ambulances..

422
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,992
- Funerals.
- I've already seen two.

423
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,370
Even the dead go by boat!

424
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,230
Wow, they've got so many!

425
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,777
Steady me.

426
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,831
There's nothing here.

427
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,681
Nothing?

428
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,558
Are you sure?

429
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,878
Oh God!

430
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,838
Look what's here!

431
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,306
See? It's like you said!

432
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,228
Look here!

433
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,730
A Beretta 93!

434
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,440
A Kalashnikov!

435
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,236
See if they're loaded.

436
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,363
- Check.
- It's unloaded.

437
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,547
Look, an M12!

438
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,174
This is the 921.

439
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,676
That bearded bum!

440
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,388
We'll see how
he blows my head off!

441
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:29,434
Enough for Casale di Principe!
Everybody!

442
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,478
Won't blow my head off now, eh?

443
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,609
Should I put two in?

444
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,822
And Nikita's?

445
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,031
And the 38?

446
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,511
- Want to see how I can shoot?
- Show me!

447
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,805
Show me!

448
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,434
Aim there!

449
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,055
I hit it!

450
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,782
We'll blow
the Colombians' heads off!

451
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,000
That's good.

452
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,798
Everything okay?

453
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,472
With love and feeling.

454
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:47,154
- What is it?
- Your wife's on the phone.

455
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,865
Tell her not to wait up.

456
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,785
Don't get tired out, need anything?

457
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,120
No, thanks.

458
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,539
- You'll lock up?
- Yes.

459
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:58,666
Goodnight.

460
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,275
Xian?

461
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,979
I have been waiting for you.

462
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,026
- I got lost.
- I am happy you came.

463
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,375
Please sit down.

464
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,922
We are cooking fish.

465
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,685
I've already eaten.

466
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,437
Try a typical Chinese dish.

467
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,605
Okay?

468
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,906
Just cooked, it is good.

469
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,825
Meat with bell peppers.

470
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,576
I've already eaten.

471
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,165
Taste.

472
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,376
We use chopsticks.

473
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,753
- I don't know how to use them.
- Try!

474
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,466
I am pleased,

475
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,469
we have a little toast.

476
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,931
We go to the factory.

477
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,232
Why not?

478
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,197
I put a pillow in here.

479
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,866
It's dangerous.

480
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,371
I already told you,
no one can know, just us.

481
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,832
It's better for both of us.

482
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,753
- Won't I need air?
- No, there's an opening.

483
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:54,175
I'll open the front window,
so air will come in.

484
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,178
Forgive me.

485
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,307
Are we sure?

486
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:07,063
It is best for both of us,
because it is dangerous.

487
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,068
- Does air come through here?
- Yes.

488
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,321
And I'll open the window too.

489
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,805
Please, come in, Mr. Pasquale.

490
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,808
All are waiting for you.

491
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,729
All are very happy.

492
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:49,248
I told them who you are
and all are happy.

493
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,169
What a nice factory!

494
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,754
More than 80 people.

495
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,300
I'm moved.

496
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,765
What can I say?

497
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,602
To do this work

498
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,688
you need lots of patience..

499
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,238
..and lots of love.

500
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,829
For the first lesson..

501
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,877
..I'll cut out a bodice.

502
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,511
Let's begin.

503
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,276
You must place patterns carefully.

504
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,867
Spread the cloth well..

505
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,101
Maria, are you asleep?

506
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:21,483
Where have I been, in China?

507
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,448
They were all bowing to me.

508
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,534
Master!

509
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,120
They called me "master"!

510
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,171
- Did you know the Chinese can cook?
- The Chinese?

511
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,089
Darn right!

512
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,551
They cooked a delicious bass!

513
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,390
There were boxes everywhere

514
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,559
and they put me in the trunk!

515
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,313
Both coming and going.

516
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,568
I need some sleep.

517
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,529
Here.

518
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:13,160
I have to sleep a few hours.

519
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,540
What's this money?

520
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,429
Where did you get it?

521
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,723
I have to sleep.

522
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,852
Help me understand.

523
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,772
I talked to my son this morning,

524
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:47,027
he said: "Mom I'm leaving,
I'm going to be a secessionist."

525
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,905
Really?

526
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,869
What did you say?

527
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,580
He's convinced,

528
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,667
he said: "We're great,"

529
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,920
"we'll win the war,
the others are nobodies."

530
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,216
War? A bunch of morons
warring against us?

531
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,677
You have to stop him.

532
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,639
This side is the right side.

533
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,017
Have you seen what's happening?

534
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,979
There are killings every day.

535
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,692
Don't say anything to anybody,
not even your husband.

536
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,778
Who'd ever tell him!

537
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,951
When he gets out, what'll he do?
Father and son will kill each other?

538
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,704
No, because your son
will stay right here.

539
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,666
They'll all come to a bad end.

540
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,465
Do you feel so sure about that?

541
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,049
I don't.

542
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,552
I do.

543
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,774
When will we see each other again?

544
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,526
When you change sides.

545
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,111
Want to stay faithful? Go ahead!

546
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,198
You go your way and I go another.

547
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,826
But we can still have
a pizza together with friends.

548
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,079
I'm telling you again,

549
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,331
friend, enemy.

550
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,504
We've known each other for so long,
why go with them?

551
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,715
Remember when we were brothers?
Now we're enemies.

552
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:20,472
I'm telling you, if you don't
change sides, we might kill you

553
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,100
or you might kill us.

554
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,603
Because we're at war,

555
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,772
people are dying every day.

556
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,322
- You could have stayed with us..
- What for?

557
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,408
I'm best on the other side.

558
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,714
Bye, Simone.

559
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:02,991
Want a little Sambuca?

560
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,957
You'll be right off, don't worry.

561
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,043
Takes time.

562
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,230
Careful when you go out.

563
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,398
Thank you.

564
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,784
Gaetano, show him.

565
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,037
- It's big.
- You're right.

566
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,080
- Enzo!
- What?

567
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,666
Do I have to tell you?

568
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,338
It's awesome.

569
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,590
I like it.

570
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,841
Like it?

571
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,677
You look great.

572
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,262
Totò, show it off.

573
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,058
It's really nice.

574
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,779
- How many so far?
- 45 doses.

575
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,239
Okay.

576
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:50,826
It's good stuff.

577
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,258
How many so far?

578
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,804
Fifty-two,
plus four that guy's still got.

579
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,932
- Understand?
- Yeah.

580
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,858
I'll get back to you later.

581
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:29,573
- How many?
- Fifty-two and that guy's got four.

582
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,533
Then we'll total it.

583
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,165
Hello!

584
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,336
Nice, eh?

585
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:45,839
Hi, gorgeous!

586
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,675
- Girls!
- Beautiful!

587
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,468
Alessia?

588
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:58,184
What are you doing here?
Get out.

589
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,188
I don't want to see you around here.

590
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,484
We have to go crying
at the prison gates?

591
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:09,946
What I went through with your father
was enough for me.

592
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,363
Good morning, Jacob.

593
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,490
- Are you alright?
- Fine, thanks, and you?

594
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,909
Have a good trip?

595
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,872
A very nice trip.

596
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:28,001
- Do you have documents?
- It's humanitarian aid.

597
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,045
Yes, it's humanitarian aid.

598
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,757
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

599
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:40,055
They've already called an ambulance.

600
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,225
Get back to work!

601
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,644
Go back to work!

602
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:50,607
What happened?

603
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,820
As they were dumping,

604
01:07:56,072 --> 01:08:00,033
two drums opened
and spilled on a truck driver.

605
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,327
- Have you already called Zio?
- No!

606
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,955
- They wanted to call an ambulance!
- I'll take care of this.

607
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,878
Pay the truckers
and tell them to fuck off.

608
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:16,758
- Who'll drive the trucks?
- Don't the blacks know how?

609
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,593
Can you drive?

610
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:21,012
They can't even ride bikes!

611
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,266
I'll handle this.

612
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:29,062
Don't let them touch the trucks,
they're ours.

613
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,357
Roberto, wait here.

614
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,526
Calm down!

615
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:45,829
You made a mistake, you had us doing
a job we shouldn't have!

616
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:49,582
It just happened!

617
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,298
- I'm taking the red one.
- No, that's mine!

618
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,726
- Take that one.
- I'll take this one!

619
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:57,942
- I'm not tall enough!
- Climb up there!

620
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:05,783
Wake up, get some cushions!

621
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,875
- The keys?
- Look under the seat!

622
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,049
Come on! Are you sleeping?

623
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,885
Can't you see there's work to do?

624
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,762
Put this under your butt!

625
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,390
Put it under your butt.

626
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:32,227
Go slowly
and drive the truck down there.

627
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,605
Then I'll pay you.

628
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,361
Catch this cushion.

629
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,407
Come on!

630
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,497
Go slow!

631
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:58,211
Move forward
and make space for that one!

632
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,546
Roberto, tell him what to do!

633
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,465
All the way down there!

634
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,580
- What is it?
- It's the new list.

635
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,084
Have you already paid
the Mellone family?

636
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,419
And the redhead's family too?

637
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:04,921
Of course.

638
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,381
Wasted money.

639
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:10,051
Let's make not make
these mistakes anymore.

640
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,719
Are these the only ones?

641
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,807
More money and less work.

642
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,101
But more risk.

643
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,978
What risk?

644
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,023
Just don't go into certain areas,

645
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:27,235
the Seven Buildings, the Smurf Houses
and the Blue Houses.

646
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,570
As for the rest,
you can go anywhere.

647
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,116
Maria's not here,
I already paid her.

648
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:39,038
- Isn't her husband with us?
- Yes, but her son betrayed.

649
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,623
They mustn't get a cent.

650
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:47,588
These things are none of your affair,
respect the list.

651
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:08,985
Who is it?

652
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,373
What is it?

653
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:24,584
- Not letting me in?
- Tell me.

654
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:27,753
No one's home.

655
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:29,380
The week's pay.

656
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:32,508
- Sure, but no one's home.
- I'll leave it with you.

657
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,428
Just a minute and I'll let you in.

658
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,316
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

659
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,818
- You came by yourself?
- I'm alone!

660
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:53,988
I'm alone.

661
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:57,283
You can give this pittance
to your cronies, hear me?

662
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:02,914
Where's the list?

663
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:07,293
Don't move!
Put your hands on the floor.

664
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:12,173
You put our names
together with your cronies'?

665
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,466
Motherfucker!

666
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:16,177
We hate those people.

667
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,013
Tell your friends that we'll come
get them in their homes

668
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:22,850
and we'll shoot them
in the head like you!

669
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,729
- How did you get here?
- On my motorbike.

670
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,774
- Now I'll shoot him.
- Not in here.

671
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,943
Go get your bike.

672
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,571
Is anyone here?

673
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,365
Leave now!

674
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,002
Don Ciro!

675
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,130
What an idiot.

676
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:43,848
Don Ciro!
Where in hell are you going?

677
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:45,725
He's nuts.

678
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:52,315
You're acting like a skittish horse,

679
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:54,650
where are you running to?

680
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:57,361
You made me take the steps
four at a time.

681
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:59,614
What can we do with you?

682
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,991
Why are you running?

683
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:05,202
A wild horse is what you seem.

684
01:17:07,247 --> 01:17:09,081
When will we talk a little?

685
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:13,044
Not even answering?

686
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,881
I've got to see
what to do with this guy,

687
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,758
I have to blast him.

688
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:22,219
What did you give me?
The same money again?

689
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,472
Is this guy an idiot?

690
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:28,601
Or are they making him
be an asshole?

691
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:32,271
Waiting for me to lose my head?

692
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,482
What can I do?

693
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,157
Let's do a stick-up?

694
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,451
A stick-up.

695
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,411
- What?
- A stick-up.

696
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,874
- No way!
- Let's do it!

697
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,379
- Stick-up a video games room?
- Our money's run out.

698
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:00,341
- What can this place have?
- Money!

699
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:03,386
Listen to me for once.

700
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,639
Cut the bullshit!

701
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:09,975
- A hold-up, no way!
- Listen to me.

702
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:13,187
Let's play one more euro and go home.

703
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:16,065
We're out of money!

704
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:21,112
They must have about 50 cents.

705
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,738
Do we do it or not?

706
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,784
You get that one and
I'll take these guys down.

707
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,996
- See all the people.
- It'll work!

708
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,457
Something fast.

709
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:40,423
Are you ready?

710
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,551
Yes or no?

711
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,806
This is a hold-up!

712
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:52,435
On the floor!

713
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,440
Get out of there!

714
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:49,385
- She's hot!
- She sucks.

715
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,387
What!

716
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:56,308
- You like her?
- What's not to like!

717
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:59,061
You like one thing,
I like another.

718
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,024
Right now!

719
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:10,990
- The blonde in the side room?
- Yeah.

720
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,449
Hillary?

721
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,337
Right away!

722
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,591
I can't even stand still.

723
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,217
I'll let you back in later.

724
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,225
- What's your name?
- Kristal.

725
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:43,772
- What do you want to do?
- Everything.

726
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:48,944
Have you ever stripped a girl?
I'll teach you.

727
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,530
- You're the first.
- You go really slow.

728
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,912
- I'm too horny.
- Sure, but you have to go slow.

729
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:04,752
You have to strip right away.

730
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,345
What do we do?

731
01:22:18,808 --> 01:22:20,225
Want to have sex?

732
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,311
Wait!

733
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:24,605
Such a hurry!

734
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:41,789
Did I hurt you?

735
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:46,251
- Why not?
- Don't bite, it hurts.

736
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,884
Hey, zip up!

737
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,761
Zip up!

738
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:59,181
- Look, I'll call..
- Call who you want.

739
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,432
Zip up!

740
01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:01,725
Come here!

741
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:04,395
- Now!
- You do it.

742
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,400
- Like this?
- It's not allowed.

743
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:11,527
Or I'll leave.

744
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,405
Come here, I zipped.

745
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:17,324
I'm gonna hurt you.

746
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:20,869
No, I'm doing the hurting to you.

747
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,372
- Really?
- What do you think?

748
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:46,520
Don't do anything to me!

749
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:57,656
Where are the weapons?

750
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:09,918
I'll give you one day
to put them back!

751
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:13,172
Get the message?

752
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:18,761
- Do I shoot them in the head?
- Let them live a little more.

753
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,805
Get back in the car.

754
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:25,100
Get the message?

755
01:24:36,529 --> 01:24:38,572
Sweet Pea, get up!

756
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,953
Don't be scared, I'm here,
we're at war!

757
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,538
Get lost!

758
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:48,332
Get up!

759
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:56,256
Enough!

760
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:58,175
Come here, don't worry!

761
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,970
- I'm getting out of here.
- No!

762
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,223
We'll beat these guys!

763
01:25:04,557 --> 01:25:06,433
Listen to me!

764
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:28,872
You're making me waste time,

765
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:32,543
you said you made a mark,
but where is it?

766
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:34,461
Oh, what is it?

767
01:25:39,425 --> 01:25:43,637
- Remember I made a mark!
- Yeah, but you can't find it!

768
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,725
You're as dumb as they come.

769
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:05,033
Took you half an hour!

770
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,910
Let's move, I have to shoot,

771
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:10,164
I can't stand not shooting!

772
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:12,374
- Want to shoot?
- Right away!

773
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:17,588
- Did you load it?
- You'd better shut up.

774
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:19,590
Sweet Pea, do like I tell you.

775
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,969
I don't give a fuck what you think.

776
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,764
We break everyone's balls,
but who've we killed?

777
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:29,850
Do like I say and get moving!

778
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:31,059
Move!

779
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:36,190
Where are we going?

780
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,150
Do I have to beat you up?

781
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:42,446
Do we have to war with each other?

782
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:46,491
I'm not warring with you,
all we have to do is shoot!

783
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:50,162
- We're going to shoot alone?
- Yeah, just you and me!

784
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:53,457
- Not thinking about later?
- I don't want to think a thing!

785
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:58,587
Want to take the wrong steps,
we'll never grow that way.

786
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,006
Listening to you, we'll die sooner.

787
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,550
Can I say something?

788
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,431
Those kids don't know how to behave,
they're just raising Cain.

789
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:12,267
- Why?
- They didn't give the weapons back.

790
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:14,102
They don't want to listen.

791
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,939
I'll make them listen my way.

792
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,527
I'll take these guys and kill them.

793
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:27,741
If you kill two kids,

794
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:30,285
what shits will we look like
in the territory

795
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:33,497
when people find out?

796
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:35,707
Are we joking?

797
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:41,880
Then the cops come,
we have to lay low for a month

798
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:44,716
and all the traffic ends.

799
01:27:48,012 --> 01:27:51,890
Zio Vittorio, they can't be
lording it around in my area,

800
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:55,852
they've already done so much,
I've warned them more than once.

801
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:58,021
I can't consider them kids anymore.

802
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:00,983
They have to die, that's final!

803
01:28:01,859 --> 01:28:05,195
You're right,
but first let's tell the families.

804
01:28:05,321 --> 01:28:07,364
I don't know who they are.

805
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:11,451
Will you take care of it?

806
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:15,706
I'll handle it!

807
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:44,651
Totò, is that you?

808
01:28:51,534 --> 01:28:54,328
- What happened to Silvana?
- In the storeroom.

809
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:12,971
How come it's so dark?

810
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:15,515
Why are you in the dark?

811
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:17,309
It's okay like this.

812
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:20,520
Your change.

813
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:25,525
- The bread?
- There wasn't any.

814
01:29:25,818 --> 01:29:28,612
- What'll we eat?
- There's pasta.

815
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:33,825
- Take your change.
- It's for you.

816
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:47,422
Why did you put her
in the storeroom?

817
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,716
She's fine where she is.

818
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:52,969
She's just an animal!

819
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:10,714
Come here a minute,
I have to talk to you.

820
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:13,967
Don't come out, it's dangerous.

821
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:16,219
Come on, no one can see you.

822
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:21,933
What are you doing, you're going?

823
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:27,105
Listen to me!

824
01:31:28,065 --> 01:31:29,774
They said I have to leave.

825
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,569
I have to leave my house.

826
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,155
I can't do anything.

827
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:36,698
I'm not leaving!

828
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:40,452
Come here a minute!

829
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:50,837
Tell those friends of yours
I'm not leaving!

830
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:54,549
Tell those nice people!

831
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:58,220
I won't betray my son
and I'm not moving from here!

832
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:02,265
Not coming in for coffee?

833
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:04,309
Run off, run away!

834
01:32:45,518 --> 01:32:46,935
Hello, accountant.

835
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:49,062
Please come in.

836
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:53,316
Why this sudden call?

837
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:54,943
You're worrying me.

838
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:57,529
The designers pay me after 60 days,

839
01:32:57,655 --> 01:33:00,198
I have a little money,

840
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:02,367
but this wasn't the agreement.

841
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:05,078
Money isn't the problem.

842
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,039
What is it then?

843
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,750
It seems

844
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:13,920
the problem is in your own house.

845
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:16,840
In my house?

846
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:18,883
What problem is it?

847
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,387
One of your associates,

848
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:25,432
Pasquale Del Prete,

849
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:27,350
has sold out to the Chinese.

850
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:39,279
We're done.

851
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:45,285
The finishing touches..

852
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,879
I never doubted.

853
01:34:16,859 --> 01:34:18,026
Everything okay?

854
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:24,658
Remember the first time
I put you to work in the factory?

855
01:34:25,117 --> 01:34:26,618
You were just a kid.

856
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:30,622
Right.

857
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:42,634
- Everything alright?
- Yes.

858
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,440
Pasquale Del Prete.

859
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:10,704
Tell him to go slower, not too fast.

860
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:26,344
Well done, Giulia.

861
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,304
She's good.

862
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:02,630
In the morning I do Tai Chi.

863
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,132
Really?

864
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:07,427
- It's nice.
- It is good for your health.

865
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:09,804
It is like in China.

866
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:15,769
When you go to the park
in the morning, it is full of people,

867
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:19,022
old people too.

868
01:36:19,148 --> 01:36:20,648
All doing Tai Chi.

869
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:23,401
Everyone

870
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:26,279
likes the culture of Tai Chi.

871
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:31,659
It's a tradition of Chinese culture.

872
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,870
When will you do egg rolls for me?

873
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,345
Wait up.

874
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:38,810
I spoke to the doctors,
you'll soon be released.

875
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:46,442
Damn you,

876
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,153
you really goofed up.

877
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:55,285
They loved the models,
they've asked for more..

878
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,911
You knew everything.

879
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:59,247
That's how I saved your life.

880
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:03,835
Those people don't kid around.

881
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:05,628
Leave me alone.

882
01:38:05,754 --> 01:38:09,632
You should thank me,
those guys will kill you.

883
01:38:10,092 --> 01:38:12,594
You and I pulled through.

884
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,471
- Find another tailor.
- Why do you say that?

885
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:19,100
- I want to be alone.
- How can I do this without you?

886
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:20,685
I really don't care.

887
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:25,106
- After all I've done for you.
- What have you done for me?

888
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:28,776
I took you off the streets,
I fed you for years.

889
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:32,614
- You've used me since I was a kid.
- Don't say that!

890
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:37,994
When you're better,
come see me, I'll give you a raise.

891
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:43,666
Rosa, give me that bike,
I have to go.

892
01:40:12,631 --> 01:40:13,923
No admittance here,

893
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:15,466
that's it.

894
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:33,109
Want to give up?

895
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:35,945
Are we meat for the slaughter house?

896
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:47,165
Let's shoot,
we'll rack up corpses too.

897
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,416
Corpses?

898
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:53,212
- I'm not moving without orders.
- What orders?

899
01:40:53,922 --> 01:40:56,340
We don't know how to move.

900
01:40:58,093 --> 01:40:59,594
We don't know anything.

901
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,433
Do we have to keep taking it?

902
01:41:05,768 --> 01:41:10,104
Do we have to wait for orders?

903
01:41:11,857 --> 01:41:13,316
Let's rack up corpses.

904
01:41:13,692 --> 01:41:17,403
What are we waiting for,
to be put down one by one?

905
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:24,077
If we don't move,
nothing will change.

906
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:26,621
No use feeling depressed.

907
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:30,833
We all have to be convinced.

908
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:33,586
But without orders,
I'm not moving.

909
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:37,673
This is open war,

910
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:39,759
you mustn't think about anyone.

911
01:41:40,552 --> 01:41:43,137
- Who do we kill?
- Let's begin in our area.

912
01:41:45,307 --> 01:41:47,141
From our own stronghold.

913
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:50,103
We don't know who's with us
and who's against us,

914
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:52,855
who do we make pay?

915
01:41:53,023 --> 01:41:55,775
Where do you think
the order to kill came from?

916
01:41:56,568 --> 01:41:58,027
Think!

917
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:01,656
Where did it come from?

918
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:04,659
- From there of course.
- From our own area.

919
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:06,577
She betrayed us.

920
01:42:06,703 --> 01:42:09,080
We don't touch women.

921
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:11,666
Don't yell!

922
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,501
What are you saying?

923
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:21,884
Don't take it out on someone
no part of this, but the son.

924
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:25,179
- How do we find him?
- His mother's in our district.

925
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:27,640
It was her son who killed Gaetano.

926
01:42:27,933 --> 01:42:29,934
Let's think what we'll do.

927
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,520
We could use the kid.

928
01:42:33,021 --> 01:42:35,189
He's the only one
who can get to her.

929
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:38,860
He brings her shopping,

930
01:42:39,194 --> 01:42:41,404
he's in good with the woman..

931
01:42:42,406 --> 01:42:44,490
So, if we have to do it,

932
01:42:44,616 --> 01:42:46,033
we'll need his help.

933
01:42:49,037 --> 01:42:51,080
Totò, what do you think you'll do?

934
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:54,792
Are you with us or against us?

935
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:02,633
What do you say?

936
01:43:05,387 --> 01:43:07,138
Are you with us or not?

937
01:43:09,224 --> 01:43:11,809
- We'll see what we can do.
- No, "we'll see".

938
01:43:11,935 --> 01:43:14,353
Either you're with us
or you're against us,

939
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:16,814
one or the other.

940
01:43:17,482 --> 01:43:21,360
If you're against us you can't leave,
we can't trust you.

941
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:24,864
It can't have been her.

942
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,824
This is our decision,

943
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:28,910
you have to be with us.

944
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:32,788
That's what we say,
you don't need to think.

945
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:39,045
What are you going to do?

946
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:43,799
- We'll see.
- I said no "we'll see".

947
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:01,359
Come on down.

948
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,653
I have to tell you something!

949
01:44:05,614 --> 01:44:07,031
No, come down!

950
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:10,618
Hurry, I have to leave!

951
01:45:51,928 --> 01:45:53,220
Sit down!

952
01:46:31,635 --> 01:46:33,344
You've known me for years,

953
01:46:33,553 --> 01:46:35,513
you know what I've always done.

954
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:39,183
I brought the money.

955
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:41,268
I brought it to your family, too.

956
01:46:43,897 --> 01:46:46,774
I did it because I was ordered to.

957
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:52,780
War isn't for me.

958
01:46:53,865 --> 01:46:56,784
But you're in it, know that?

959
01:46:58,703 --> 01:47:00,121
Yes.

960
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:01,247
So?

961
01:47:02,499 --> 01:47:03,457
You tell me.

962
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:04,959
What can I tell you?

963
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:11,257
What did you come here for?

964
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:15,177
To talk to you.

965
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:17,888
About what?

966
01:47:21,476 --> 01:47:22,935
I want to save myself.

967
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:25,563
You'll have to buy your life,

968
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:28,441
I won't give it to you.

969
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:34,780
What I did there,

970
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:37,575
I can do for you here.

971
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:40,661
We don't need money-carriers,

972
01:47:41,371 --> 01:47:44,498
we have to score,
kill people, and we need money.

973
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:47,334
You're wasting your time.

974
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:52,298
You're more dead than alive.

975
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:53,841
But we were brothers before.

976
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:56,886
Before!

977
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:59,805
Then they started
messing around with shit.

978
01:48:05,228 --> 01:48:10,316
Our relatives were good people..
So they killed them!

979
01:48:12,527 --> 01:48:13,986
So, don't come asking

980
01:48:14,112 --> 01:48:15,779
to pass to the other side.

981
01:48:16,406 --> 01:48:18,657
We have to score, kill,

982
01:48:19,117 --> 01:48:20,534
and we need money.

983
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:23,120
If not, you die,

984
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:25,331
because you're part of the war.

985
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:27,791
You bring money and I kill people,

986
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:30,044
we're the same, you and me,
in this war.

987
01:48:32,464 --> 01:48:34,465
- I understand.
- You understand.

988
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:47,520
Wait a moment.

989
01:49:18,927 --> 01:49:20,177
Everything okay?

990
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:24,348
And you?

991
01:49:32,148 --> 01:49:33,357
That's four.

992
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:48,038
Face on the table!

993
01:49:49,124 --> 01:49:50,082
Done?

994
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,542
Let's go!

995
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:00,801
Come on out!

996
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:02,928
Lucky, eh?

997
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:32,226
That's poison.

998
01:51:33,478 --> 01:51:34,645
What'd he say?

999
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:38,982
My father wants to say the dumping
you're doing on our land

1000
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,193
isn't garbage.

1001
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:42,945
It's poison.

1002
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:45,155
It's not garbage?

1003
01:51:47,117 --> 01:51:48,867
You heard right.

1004
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:50,786
Don't worry.

1005
01:51:51,496 --> 01:51:55,040
A year's gone by with this dumping?

1006
01:51:56,418 --> 01:51:59,962
So far,
all we've done is pay our debts.

1007
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:01,672
Just barely.

1008
01:52:02,006 --> 01:52:05,968
- Euro.
- I understand, Don Raffaele.

1009
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:11,473
Everything costs double in euro.

1010
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:12,725
And so?

1011
01:52:12,934 --> 01:52:16,228
We need something more.

1012
01:52:17,772 --> 01:52:21,692
These are the prices,
explain it to your kids,

1013
01:52:22,193 --> 01:52:24,361
if I do it for you,
I have to do it for everyone.

1014
01:52:24,487 --> 01:52:26,113
Don't put me
in a difficult situation.

1015
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:30,284
Okay, if you give us more,
everyone has to get more.

1016
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:32,286
So, little can be done.

1017
01:52:32,412 --> 01:52:34,621
But, we barely make ends meet,

1018
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:36,540
we can't go on like this.

1019
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:39,126
We were thinking,

1020
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:43,213
is it possible to do more dumping?

1021
01:52:46,384 --> 01:52:47,801
Euro..

1022
01:52:48,553 --> 01:52:49,928
More dumping?

1023
01:52:50,805 --> 01:52:54,099
We have another piece of land
for other dumping sites.

1024
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:55,350
Near here?

1025
01:52:56,519 --> 01:52:57,853
Around here.

1026
01:52:58,396 --> 01:53:00,063
More dumping we do,

1027
01:53:00,523 --> 01:53:03,108
faster the ground gets filled.

1028
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:06,779
You have another piece of land?

1029
01:53:06,905 --> 01:53:09,615
- Near here?
- Further on.

1030
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:12,659
This other land
would be more convenient,

1031
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:16,705
it's bigger and trucks
can get in easier.

1032
01:53:17,248 --> 01:53:18,540
But..

1033
01:53:21,002 --> 01:53:22,753
Still 100 euros per dumping.

1034
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:24,963
What do you mean, 100 euros!

1035
01:53:25,173 --> 01:53:28,717
Don't speak out of turn.

1036
01:53:28,843 --> 01:53:30,803
- He can't increase!
- Who said so?

1037
01:53:30,929 --> 01:53:34,097
We'll increase the trucks.

1038
01:53:34,349 --> 01:53:38,185
You have to increase
the price of each dumping.

1039
01:53:38,353 --> 01:53:39,937
Want to lose everything?

1040
01:53:40,063 --> 01:53:42,272
They have nowhere else to turn.

1041
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:43,482
Excuse me.

1042
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:45,067
Don't worry.

1043
01:53:47,946 --> 01:53:50,572
Alright, now we'll reach..

1044
01:53:54,744 --> 01:53:55,869
an agreement.

1045
01:53:55,995 --> 01:54:00,916
Give him a glass of water.

1046
01:54:01,042 --> 01:54:02,376
I'll do it, don't worry.

1047
01:54:11,094 --> 01:54:12,344
Luca!

1048
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:22,729
You have to clean up this field!

1049
01:54:23,147 --> 01:54:24,231
I'm not Luca.

1050
01:54:24,357 --> 01:54:25,732
Do a little work.

1051
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:28,610
My name's Roberto.

1052
01:54:31,322 --> 01:54:33,866
This field is such a mess.

1053
01:54:34,742 --> 01:54:36,326
All such a mess.

1054
01:54:37,328 --> 01:54:39,830
Ma'am, it's raining.

1055
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:41,540
Should I stop?

1056
01:54:42,166 --> 01:54:43,500
Come out of there.

1057
01:54:46,588 --> 01:54:48,505
I'll take you inside.

1058
01:54:48,631 --> 01:54:50,549
I'll be right along.

1059
01:54:51,634 --> 01:54:53,302
They've made ditches here,

1060
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:55,137
someone should come

1061
01:54:56,014 --> 01:54:57,848
to fill them.

1062
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:01,143
Let's go!

1063
01:55:25,543 --> 01:55:27,628
What beautiful peaches, thank you!

1064
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:30,339
I'll take them to the kids.

1065
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:32,716
See how beautiful they are!

1066
01:55:33,217 --> 01:55:34,176
Let's go.

1067
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:36,887
Put them in the car.

1068
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:38,430
Come on!

1069
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:53,487
Toss that stuff.

1070
01:55:54,572 --> 01:55:56,156
- What?
- The peaches.

1071
01:55:56,282 --> 01:55:58,367
Can't you smell how they stink?

1072
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:21,723
Done?

1073
01:56:39,742 --> 01:56:40,867
What?

1074
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:42,411
Listen,

1075
01:56:43,413 --> 01:56:45,372
I've been thinking.

1076
01:56:46,541 --> 01:56:48,792
Maybe I'm not cut out for this work.

1077
01:56:49,085 --> 01:56:50,419
What?

1078
01:56:50,545 --> 01:56:53,005
I mean it.

1079
01:56:53,381 --> 01:56:55,048
I'm not up to it.

1080
01:56:56,467 --> 01:56:58,218
We're doing so well!

1081
01:56:59,804 --> 01:57:00,929
No,

1082
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:03,598
I don't want to work anymore,

1083
01:57:04,142 --> 01:57:05,267
I'm sorry.

1084
01:57:11,232 --> 01:57:13,775
Think this job sucks?

1085
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:17,612
You know that guys like me
put this shit country in Europe?

1086
01:57:19,157 --> 01:57:22,659
Know how many workers I've helped
by saving their companies money?

1087
01:57:22,785 --> 01:57:24,703
Stop and look!

1088
01:57:25,747 --> 01:57:26,872
What do you see?

1089
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:30,584
Debts.

1090
01:57:31,335 --> 01:57:34,379
All these people have been saved
only thanks to us.

1091
01:57:36,674 --> 01:57:38,550
I saw how you help them live.

1092
01:57:39,469 --> 01:57:42,262
You save a worker in Mestre
and kill a family in Mondragone.

1093
01:57:42,388 --> 01:57:45,015
That's how it works,
but I didn't decide it.

1094
01:57:45,767 --> 01:57:48,477
We solve problems created by others.

1095
01:57:49,187 --> 01:57:51,188
I didn't create
chromium and asbestos,

1096
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:53,148
I didn't dig up the mountain.

1097
01:57:53,274 --> 01:57:55,942
That's how it works?

1098
01:57:56,069 --> 01:57:57,486
I don't work that way.

1099
01:57:59,197 --> 01:58:00,405
I'm not like you.

1100
01:58:00,531 --> 01:58:03,700
- What are you like?
- I'm different.

1101
01:58:08,247 --> 01:58:09,790
Go make pizzas!

1102
01:58:10,708 --> 01:58:12,042
He's different.

1103
01:58:15,129 --> 01:58:17,464
Don't think you're better than me!

1104
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:20,509
I gave you a chance!

1105
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,347
Go fuck yourself!

1106
01:59:25,324 --> 01:59:29,619
I think Scarlett Johansson's here!

1107
01:59:29,787 --> 01:59:31,496
Splendid, magnificent,

1108
01:59:31,998 --> 01:59:34,499
all dressed in white,

1109
01:59:36,836 --> 01:59:38,086
cream.

1110
01:59:38,796 --> 01:59:41,965
- In style with the film.
- Absolutely.

1111
01:59:42,091 --> 01:59:45,468
Right colors,
right choice of dress.

1112
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:51,349
It would be nice to know
why it took so long to get ready..

1113
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:55,395
Because it's chic

1114
01:59:56,230 --> 01:59:58,356
yet so sophisticated.

1115
01:59:58,566 --> 02:00:03,153
An apparent simplicity,
but in reality, very elaborate..

1116
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:05,071
Allow me to say..

1117
02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:08,742
Maybe to be awaited as a true star.

1118
02:00:08,993 --> 02:00:12,412
She's a star, and so beautiful.

1119
02:00:13,581 --> 02:00:15,916
The photographers are going crazy.

1120
02:00:17,919 --> 02:00:19,336
And the people too..

1121
02:01:27,697 --> 02:01:30,031
May I sit at your table?

1122
02:01:35,955 --> 02:01:38,873
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- We don't smoke.

1123
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:43,545
Everyone here talks about you.

1124
02:01:43,879 --> 02:01:47,465
You kids have balls, I can use you.

1125
02:01:47,842 --> 02:01:50,885
Why don't you join my guys?

1126
02:01:51,554 --> 02:01:53,555
You'll have money, motorbikes,

1127
02:01:53,723 --> 02:01:55,140
anything you want.

1128
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:57,600
I already saved you once,

1129
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:01,146
because here
they don't like you guys.

1130
02:02:01,397 --> 02:02:03,398
You're causing too much trouble.

1131
02:02:04,483 --> 02:02:06,318
It's wise to be with me,

1132
02:02:06,444 --> 02:02:09,738
that way you don't have to worry,
you're covered.

1133
02:02:09,947 --> 02:02:11,531
We want to stay alone,

1134
02:02:12,033 --> 02:02:14,117
we don't want to be under anyone.

1135
02:02:15,369 --> 02:02:17,912
We don't like to be under people.

1136
02:02:18,831 --> 02:02:20,999
We're just for us, that's all.

1137
02:02:22,668 --> 02:02:25,378
May I confide in you?

1138
02:02:25,504 --> 02:02:28,340
It's obvious you're courageous.

1139
02:02:28,466 --> 02:02:30,175
You're not talking to cops.

1140
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:33,553
What is it?

1141
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:37,307
I have a good job for you
and you'll earn a barrel of money.

1142
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:40,727
- Money?
- Money's the first thing.

1143
02:02:40,853 --> 02:02:42,729
We know.

1144
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:47,400
- May I come closer?
- Sure.

1145
02:02:48,194 --> 02:02:51,654
It's something not to be overheard,
just between us.

1146
02:02:51,906 --> 02:02:53,656
I need a big favor,

1147
02:02:54,283 --> 02:02:56,159
you could do a "job" for me.

1148
02:02:56,285 --> 02:02:58,661
I see you've got balls,

1149
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:03,500
but this guy's a hot one, he's big.

1150
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:06,002
We really like these things.

1151
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,671
I'm crazy for them.

1152
02:03:09,298 --> 02:03:11,549
You have to kill Peppe the Horseman.

1153
02:03:11,675 --> 02:03:14,719
He's a traitor, he took my woman.

1154
02:03:17,139 --> 02:03:19,265
You have to shoot him in the balls

1155
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,684
and then in the mouth.

1156
02:03:21,852 --> 02:03:23,645
I go crazy for these things.

1157
02:03:25,064 --> 02:03:28,024
But you have to do me a favor.

1158
02:03:28,734 --> 02:03:33,571
They told me you
stole some weapons from around here.

1159
02:03:34,073 --> 02:03:38,284
You have to give them back,
we gotta make them disappear.

1160
02:03:39,245 --> 02:03:41,704
- I'll give you the weapons.
- You will?

1161
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:43,540
Weapons, motorbikes,
anything you want.

1162
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:45,041
Let's talk about the money.

1163
02:03:45,167 --> 02:03:49,045
Tell me what you want
for this job.

1164
02:03:49,296 --> 02:03:50,797
A really good amount.

1165
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:53,842
Is 10,000 euro enough?

1166
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:57,512
Yes.

1167
02:03:57,638 --> 02:04:00,807
I'll give you an advance,
the rest when the job's done.

1168
02:04:11,318 --> 02:04:12,861
Put it in your pocket.

1169
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,157
- Is it right?
- Fine.

1170
02:05:49,416 --> 02:05:51,251
- Not there.
- Then where?

1171
02:05:52,253 --> 02:05:55,046
- Where the fuck do we go?
- Who knows where he went!

1172
02:05:58,133 --> 02:05:59,968
- We lost him.
- Are you sure?

1173
02:06:03,013 --> 02:06:07,350
- Look over there.
- There's nothing.

1174
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:11,145
Then where?

1175
02:06:11,272 --> 02:06:12,564
There he is!

1176
02:08:02,716 --> 02:08:03,883
Get off.

1177
02:08:19,108 --> 02:08:20,608
Come on!

1178
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:27,842
For two kids such a waste of time.

1179
02:09:28,135 --> 02:09:29,761
Guys, it had to be done.

1180
02:09:30,095 --> 02:09:31,512
Everything's okay.

1181
02:11:23,083 --> 02:11:27,003
In Europe the Camorra has killed more
than all other criminal organizations.

1182
02:11:27,087 --> 02:11:29,964
4,000 deaths in the last 30 years,
one every three days.

1183
02:11:30,591 --> 02:11:34,218
Scampia is the biggest
drug-pushing locality in the world.

1184
02:11:34,303 --> 02:11:37,471
Daily sales per clan
run about 500,000 euro.

1185
02:11:37,973 --> 02:11:41,684
If clan-managed waste were piled,
it would reach 14,600 meters.

1186
02:11:41,768 --> 02:11:43,436
Everest is 8,850 meters.

1187
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:46,856
There is a 20% increase in cancer
in the poisoned areas.

1188
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:51,444
Gains from illegal activities are
reinvested in legal ones worldwide.

1189
02:11:51,528 --> 02:11:56,282
The Camorra has also invested
in the reconstruction of the Twin Towers.

1190
