1
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,659
How long you gonna be?

2
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,737
Be right out,

3
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,745
you're a pain!

4
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,664
Hey, American.

5
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,705
I'm still here, gettin' a manicure.

6
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,746
Things okay?

7
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,704
Gettin' tanned? Don't get burned!

8
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,585
Bruno's here too.

9
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,659
You got a crap body!

10
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,779
Is Bruno here?

11
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,698
He's over there.

12
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,699
You doin' a lamp?

13
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,663
It's 2,000.

14
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,627
How much are you
supposed to get this week?

15
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,778
9,200.

16
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,586
Sure? It was less last week.

17
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,625
Yes, Don Ciro 9,200.

18
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,625
Another 2,000 Euro and we're even.

19
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,585
Don Ciro, don't take all day.

20
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,545
He's slow.

21
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,665
Hurry, so we can go home.

22
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,585
Things okay out there?

23
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,783
Keep your eyes open.

24
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,737
That's it.

25
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,705
Put paper cups in.

26
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,783
Toilet paper.

27
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,547
- Then, Mom?
- Some shampoo.

28
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,743
A mozzarella...

29
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,625
Shampoo, not bath oil!

30
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,581
You're rushin' me!

31
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,659
And you're drivin' me crazy!

32
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,546
Hurry up, there are
more groceries to deliver.

33
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,585
- Nothing else?
- No.

34
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,706
- Be back later.
- Don't get yourself lost.

35
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,785
- Simone.
- Toto, what's up?

36
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,586
- What's happening?
- I'm workin'.

37
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,740
Know what happened?
They arrested Vitale and Bon Bon.

38
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,618
Really?

39
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,700
- Got somethin' to eat?
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

40
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,665
Bye, see you.

41
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,625
Carmela, ma'am!

42
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,783
Hi, Boxer.

43
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,619
Two doses, two doses!

44
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,625
Please, give me a dose!

45
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,580
Gaetano, check it!

46
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,545
One, two, three...

47
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,744
Goodbye.

48
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,745
Don Ciro, be more punctual.

49
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,580
I'll pass it on.

50
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,658
Eleven and twelve.

51
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,579
See if he wants coffee.

52
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,659
No, but thank you anyway...

53
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,625
I'll show you out.

54
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,580
Have a good day.

55
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,586
Four hundred...

56
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,778
Five hundred.

57
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,659
The same amount again?

58
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,666
I've said a hundred times
I can't manage like this.

59
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,658
Don Carlo...

60
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,542
Did you tell them I can't manage
on this chickenfeed?

61
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,581
I have to pay rent, lights, water.

62
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,541
I can't survive,
I'm strapped with debts.

63
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,660
- I'll pass it on.
- You always say that!

64
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,541
Are you mockin' me?

65
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,743
I don't get it!

66
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,743
Listen,

67
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,625
I've got a son to support,

68
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,666
for forty years
I've kept him off the streets,

69
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,625
he's unemployed.

70
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,700
What can I do,
go over to the other side?

71
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,588
They know, I served you honestly
for forty years.

72
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,706
My wife's in jail,
is this the thanks we get?

73
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,540
Are we crazy?
Do I have to raise hell?

74
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,704
Silvana!

75
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,546
May I?

76
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,778
Come on in!

77
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,618
Maria!

78
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,546
The bill?

79
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,699
Talk to Mom.

80
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,620
Put this in your pocket.

81
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,586
Thank you.

82
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,625
Carabinieri on the street!

83
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,705
He's comin' out!

84
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,547
I'm the best, number one!

85
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,743
So?

86
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,664
Go, Marco!

87
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,742
- I'll blast these roaches!
- Who do you think you're fighting?

88
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,540
I'm number one! Tony Montana!

89
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,659
The world is ours!

90
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,621
You don't know
who you're up against!

91
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,659
I'm Tony Montana!

92
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,587
- I'm the powerhouse!
- Yeah!

93
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,704
Come here.

94
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,579
Shit Colombians,

95
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,580
they're everywhere.

96
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,547
See, Colombians everywhere.

97
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,542
You really looked like Scarface.

98
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,580
You were good.

99
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,784
Now it all has to be ours,
the whole world.

100
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,625
Miami, all of it.

101
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,699
My friend, got stuff?

102
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,783
You got stuff?

103
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,661
- Got good stuff?
- You got money?

104
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,582
- Sure, you got coke?
- What do you want to pay?

105
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,705
Me? 50.

106
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,740
- 55, can you do it?
- No, 55 is too much, 50.

107
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,745
You sure?

108
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,580
Wait here for me.

109
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,777
Where's Smarty?

110
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,698
Hey, kid!

111
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,540
Give him the money.

112
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,621
- Is it all here?
- Yeah.

113
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,542
- Okay?
- Yes.

114
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,661
- Want to see it?
- I want to try it.

115
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,783
I gave you the money!

116
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,698
Wait!

117
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,700
Open your hand.

118
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,624
It's good.

119
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,783
Give me all of it!

120
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,545
Grab the money!

121
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,625
Giovanni, I brought the kids.

122
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,744
Come in.

123
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,744
You know very well why you're here.

124
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,740
Too much ruckus going on in my area,
because I'm the boss here.

125
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,783
That's just you sayin'.

126
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,739
If I had you come here, I know.
No back-talk

127
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,704
or I'll smash your face!

128
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,746
- What happened?
- For the moment, nothing.

129
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,783
Get me?

130
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,627
I can't be made to look bad
because of two kids like you.

131
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,740
The next time
I hear anything about you,

132
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,743
I'll blow your heads off.

133
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,580
- If it's like you say...
- Shut up when I'm talking.

134
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,705
Then if I come to realize

135
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,705
you're worth something,

136
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,587
which I'll determine and I'll decide,

137
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,547
you can work for me.

138
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,699
Is that clear?

139
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,580
Show them out.

140
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,585
"I'll smash your face!"

141
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,705
And I'll tear your beard!

142
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,540
Without a T-shirt.

143
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,665
"Sweet Pea", looked like a bum.

144
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,744
A real bum.

145
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,746
He is a bum! Did you see
who he sent to get us?

146
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,699
If that guy's the boss here,

147
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,745
then here we can be the bosses.

148
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,660
If a guy like him is boss here,
this area is ours!

149
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,585
I'll live for 30 years
if he's boss here.

150
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,581
Sure, because he's a retard!

151
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,662
Get it? I'II live for 30 years.

152
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,542
But he could at least shave!

153
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,698
Shave!

154
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,625
"I'll smash your face!"

155
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,704
Let's go have a snort to spite him.

156
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,586
We've got everything,
we can do like we want.

157
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,581
Anyway, he's a fat shit-ass.

158
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,625
He bugged you?

159
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,745
He showers once a week!

160
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,705
"I'll blow your heads off!"

161
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,784
Roberto!

162
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,619
Let's go, it's too small.

163
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,588
- But the methane one's big.
- No, it's small.

164
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,748
- Can I finish measuring?
- No, we're wasting time.

165
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,628
- I have to take some shots.
- What a bore with these pictures!

166
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,580
Let's go!

167
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,620
Just look at this.

168
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,585
It's disgusting down there.

169
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,697
Here is perfect.

170
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,540
It's perfect.

171
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,780
We're near the highway,
the trucks can get really close,

172
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,546
they dump the earth
and cover all the water.

173
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,744
Perfect.

174
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,779
Franco, it's 85 meters.

175
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,545
Get the length too.

176
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,585
Come here.

177
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,584
Dante.

178
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,665
Hello, everything okay?

179
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,745
This is Roberto.

180
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,746
- It's time we made room for youth.
- We need new energy.

181
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,745
Take a few more shots.

182
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,625
Did you hear?

183
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,699
They bombed me,

184
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,665
at the cement plant.

185
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,779
A whole wall came down,

186
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,658
slowly.

187
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,665
Be careful.

188
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,705
Zio resolved it.

189
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,586
I'd forgotten to pay
for some land I'd bought.

190
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,621
- An injunction against payment?
- Yeah!

191
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,785
- What do you think?
- It's fine.

192
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,622
- Can we fill this quarry?
- Sure can.

193
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,665
Tell Zio it's fine.

194
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,708
Remember, everything clean:
Terracing, solid stuff...

195
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,700
Or the redevelopment agency
will break our balls.

196
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,740
Don't worry,
you emptied it and I'll fill it.

197
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,702
All the pieces have to be cut
and the sizes worked out.

198
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,659
They want 120 of these.

199
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,699
Six and seven are identical.

200
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,705
Here the satin is cut on the bias.

201
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,700
It's all hand-hemmed.

202
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,665
Is it tough?

203
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,706
The models aren't hard,
I can do it.

204
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,784
Eight hundred items in two months,
is our request.

205
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,546
Keep in mind
we start at 50 Euros per item.

206
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,700
You've seen the models,
the price is good,

207
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,587
estimate and make your offers.

208
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,785
Thirty Euro, 30 days?

209
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,579
Don't go any lower.

210
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,699
This is high fashion,
it's not pret-a-porter.

211
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,705
Forty-five, in two months.

212
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,705
- Ms. Zamarion!
- Yes?

213
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,779
Thirty-eight, forty.

214
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,625
That's a very interesting proposal.

215
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,620
Thirty-five, thirty-five,

216
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,666
excellent workmanship
and delivery times respected.

217
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,700
Thirty, thirty!

218
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,697
Please,

219
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,542
we're not imposing anything!

220
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,659
Did we say thirty, thirty?

221
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,660
At this point

222
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,660
twenty-eight, thirty!

223
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,620
Thirty, twenty-five!

224
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,665
I can't lose this bid.

225
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,779
Come here, there's some bubbly!

226
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,580
Are they coming?

227
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,784
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

228
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,541
Five days less for delivery,

229
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,541
we'll have to work overtime,
and I'II do nights...

230
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,619
What's odd about that?

231
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,665
They're talking overtime pay.

232
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,705
They'II get it!

233
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,706
Am I scared of a little overtime?

234
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,580
Like the last time?

235
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,699
Don't worry,
this time it's a sure thing.

236
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,667
- They've lost their trust.
- I know.

237
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,662
- I asked you to talk to them.
- You do it, please.

238
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,706
You're on closer terms,
they respect you.

239
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,665
Do me this favor.

240
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,739
Don't say no, go talk to them.

241
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,700
You know I'm fond of you,

242
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,745
I'll have to make
a gold statue to you!

243
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,587
I'll go down and see the accountant
for the money.

244
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,581
Sorry, how much is this?

245
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,663
Ten thousand.

246
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,665
It's not enough, I need more.

247
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,703
Twice that at least.

248
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,585
Mr. Enzo,
you're already "complicated".

249
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,705
Yes, but for personal affairs.

250
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,587
I need this for work.

251
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,705
I'II give it back in three months.

252
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,587
But this isn't enough.

253
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,739
If you don't need it
and it's not enough,

254
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,743
I'll take it back.

255
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,703
It's best for you.

256
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,619
Don't be like that, listen,

257
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,745
I need at least double!

258
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,545
It's no risk,

259
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,743
you'll earn from it, right?

260
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,658
What can I say?

261
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,581
I'll pass it on,
can you make-do for now?

262
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,665
Yes, I'II take it.

263
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,619
Congratulations, Mr. Pasquale.

264
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,738
Thank you.

265
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,743
We met yesterday.

266
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,699
I need your help.

267
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,745
I am having trouble with work.

268
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,701
I have to get into
haute couture right away,

269
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,625
but for me

270
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,579
it is very difficult.

271
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,665
I need help.

272
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,705
You are

273
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,579
a great master,

274
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,779
you are very important for me.

275
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,545
You teach ten lessons

276
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,547
to workers in my factory.

277
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,745
I pay you in cash,

278
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,739
2,000 Euros a lesson

279
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,777
for ten lessons.

280
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,780
We work together,
but no one knows it,

281
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,700
just the two of us.

282
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,585
I need your help.

283
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,580
Think it over.

284
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,627
- What's the cloth like?
- Come and see.

285
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,697
I've got nothin'!

286
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,745
Don't move!

287
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,701
They must have gone over to his side,

288
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,586
or they'd hsve arrested
me first and then those other guys.

289
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,746
Believe me? All of them were there
when I called you.

290
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,587
I said: Check out this car,
it's suspect.

291
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,625
This stuff here is ours.

292
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,625
My gun!

293
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,546
Check this stuff out,
there should be fifty-six.

294
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,659
Good, Toto, this is for you.

295
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,785
How can I get working with you?

296
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,579
We'll let you know.

297
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,744
- Did you turn off the water?
- Of course!

298
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,739
- Can I help out?
- No, you'll get wet.

299
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,703
Doesn't matter!

300
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,540
Come and see.

301
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,585
Careful not to slip.

302
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,588
- Is it coming from the well?
- No, I think it's from the pipe.

303
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,627
Careful, water's coming in.

304
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,547
See if you can close it.

305
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,665
It's closed,
but it's the pipe that...

306
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,779
I'd give you a hand, but...

307
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,743
What a great day!

308
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,585
Push it all in one direction.

309
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,541
I thought I'd be having coffee!

310
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,700
- Nice coffee, huh?
- I'll have some next time.

311
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,585
Totore, things okay?

312
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,701
- Can I say hi?
- No, you gotta leave.

313
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,542
Go down with these bags!

314
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,585
You have to move!

315
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,659
Ma'am, go around the other way.

316
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,666
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine, leave.

317
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,744
Lucia?

318
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,698
Come closer.

319
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,541
- What's your nsme?
- Luigi.

320
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,581
- Are you scared?
- No.

321
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,739
- Sure?
- No.

322
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,737
We'll see.

323
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,706
- Are you strong?
- Yeah!

324
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,705
Let's see how strong you are.

325
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,625
Why are you shaking?

326
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,540
No?

327
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,621
- See how strong this kid is.
- Come closer!

328
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,587
- Are you scared?
- Yes.

329
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,580
Now you're a man.

330
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,739
Nothin'! Everything's okay!

331
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,622
When I did my piercing,
I got an infection.

332
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,585
Let's see.

333
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,579
You went and did it there?

334
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,627
- I'd like to have it on my eyebrow.
- Stinks.

335
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,699
It's nicer there, you're right.

336
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,745
It's gonna rain.

337
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,698
Everything's okay!

338
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,779
A car's coming!

339
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,620
It went in!

340
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,665
It's going in!

341
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,579
Check out this other one!

342
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,660
Everything's okay!

343
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,700
Sorry I'm late, the Councilman,
City Hall, the traffic...

344
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,699
- My father.
- How do you do.

345
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,586
I'm glad he's with you
you're a good person.

346
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,699
He's in your care.

347
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,700
He's a clever guy.

348
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,737
I don't doubt that but...

349
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,661
- Having work is important to him.
- Of course.

350
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,621
I tried so hard
to find him work in Naples...

351
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,746
- Where do you work?
- In the hospital, intensive care.

352
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,625
A bad division.

353
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,741
I tried to get him in,
but I have no connections.

354
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,579
He's all set now.

355
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,581
You did something no one else did.

356
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,739
I thank you, you raised him well.

357
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,740
Have you always worked in Naples?

358
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,619
No, also in Trieste, Udine,

359
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,619
- Venice...
- That's where we're going.

360
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,666
I told him about Venice.

361
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,746
He's excited, it's his first time.

362
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,740
Dad, we have a plane.

363
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,585
Did you bring some things?

364
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,745
What's that, your gym bag?

365
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,627
- Goodbye.
- He's in your care.

366
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,582
- What do you pay for disposal?
- Today I'm paying 50.

367
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,783
Your offer?

368
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,585
We can halve your costs,

369
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,580
25 cents a kilo.

370
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,580
That's good,

371
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,659
but is it all "clean",
like they say in the United States?

372
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,665
Since it's toxic waste,

373
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,547
certification,
storage and transportation.

374
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,706
- Is there a contract to look over?
- Of course.

375
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,620
In case you're wondering,

376
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,699
the disposal cycle

377
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,587
goes to the dispossl area
in Marcianise.

378
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,585
I'm telling you in fairness.

379
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,739
Thank you for the information,

380
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,784
but my only concern
is that it's "clean".

381
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,625
You can rest assured of that.

382
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,699
We can dispose of all the waste

383
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,785
that you produce in a year.

384
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,703
Eight hundred tons.

385
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,584
It's not a problem.

386
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,783
That's a lot.

387
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,785
My concern is disposal.

388
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,739
We serve various companies,
you can check.

389
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,705
I already have!

390
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,620
Don't worry.

391
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,661
As far as I can see,
there's maximum transparency.

392
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,540
Absolutely.

393
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,746
- The warehouses at Teverola?
- We use them for tires.

394
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,624
Exactly.

395
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,701
Will we put the tannery waste
in the quarry?

396
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,542
- Don't talk foolishness.
- Where then?

397
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,665
Check the European catalogue.

398
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,620
Here they are,04.

399
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,739
The ones in red,
are among the most dangerous.

400
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,706
"Exhausted degreasing baths
with solvents, no liquid phase."

401
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,777
No, no good.

402
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,699
Then 4-11:

403
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,627
"Waste containing halogenated
compounds from operations

404
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,665
of manufacturing and finishing."

405
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,660
These are good.

406
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,537
It's stuff the earth absorbs,
we'll mix it with compost.

407
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,698
Fertilizer!

408
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,546
All that leaves is
Milan's sweeping refuse,

409
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,540
that's 60 trucks.

410
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,541
- The quarries at San Felice?
- They're too small.

411
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,585
I don't think so, look.

412
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,665
Let me see.

413
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,739
They're too small
and they're shallow,

414
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,665
they're no good.

415
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,577
Yes... I've got
ten contracts out of ten.

416
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,703
Is he near you?

417
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,663
Put him on.

418
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,697
I'll talk to him.

419
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,581
I told him, everything's okay.

420
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,581
- Do you like traveling?
- Sure!

421
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,740
We'll take more trips.

422
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,739
Everyone here works in boats?

423
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,580
Everyone, firemen, ambulances...

424
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,746
- Funerals.
- I've already seen two.

425
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,579
Even the dead go by boat!

426
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,739
Wow, they've got so many!

427
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,624
Steady me.

428
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,620
There's nothing here.

429
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,700
Nothing?

430
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,665
Are you sure?

431
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,620
Oh God!

432
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,625
Look what's here!

433
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,705
See? It's like you said!

434
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,585
Look here!

435
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,585
A Beretta 93!

436
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,545
A Kalashnikov!

437
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,739
See if they're loaded.

438
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,739
- Check.
- It's unloaded.

439
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,580
Look, an M12!

440
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,745
This is the 921.

441
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,663
That bearded bum!

442
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,785
We'll see how
he blows my head off!

443
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,786
Enough for Casale di Principe!
Everybody!

444
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,625
Won't blow my head off now, eh?

445
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,745
Should I put two in?

446
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,620
And Nikita's?

447
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,620
And the 38?

448
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,740
- Want to see how I can shoot?
- Show me!

449
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,625
Show me!

450
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,625
Aim there!

451
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,620
I hit it!

452
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,665
We'll blow
the Colombians' heads off!

453
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,625
That's good.

454
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,665
Everything okay?

455
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,625
With love and feeling.

456
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,739
- What is it?
- Your wife's on the phone.

457
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,783
Tell her not to wait up.

458
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,739
Don't get tired out, need anything?

459
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,703
No, thanks.

460
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,779
- You'll lock up?
- Yes.

461
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,704
Goodnight.

462
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,620
Xian?

463
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,743
I have been waiting for you.

464
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,780
- I got lost.
- I am happy you came.

465
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,658
Please sit down.

466
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,705
We are cooking fish.

467
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,585
I've already eaten.

468
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,665
Try a typical Chinese dish.

469
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,703
Okay?

470
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,627
Just cooked, it is good.

471
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,580
Meat with bell peppers.

472
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,625
I've already eaten.

473
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:01,738
Taste.

474
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,545
We use chopsticks.

475
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,665
- I don't know how to use them.
- Try!

476
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,625
I am pleased,

477
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,705
we have a little toast.

478
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,542
We go to the factory.

479
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,665
Why not?

480
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,625
I put a pillow in here.

481
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,625
It's dangerous.

482
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,582
I already told you,
no one can know, just us.

483
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,739
It's better for both of us.

484
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,627
- Won't I need air?
- No, there's an opening.

485
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,626
I'll open the front window,
so air will come in.

486
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,545
Forgive me.

487
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,783
Are we sure?

488
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,786
It is best for both of us,
because it is dangerous.

489
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,581
- Does air come through here?
- Yes.

490
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,779
And I'II open the window too.

491
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,579
Please come in, Mr. Pasquale.

492
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,745
All are waiting for you.

493
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,665
All are very happy.

494
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,739
I told them who you are
and all are happy.

495
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,540
What a nice factory!

496
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,745
More than 80 people.

497
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,665
I'm moved.

498
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,625
What can I say?

499
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,739
To do this work

500
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,542
you need lots of patience...

501
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,700
... and lots of love.

502
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,705
For the first lesson...

503
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,665
... I'II cut out a bodice.

504
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,738
Let's begin.

505
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,581
You must place patterns carefully.

506
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,739
Spread the cloth well...

507
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,625
Maria, are you asleep?

508
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,699
Where have I been, in China?

509
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,659
They were all bowing to me.

510
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,580
Master!

511
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,587
They called me "master"!

512
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,580
- Did you know the Chinese can cook?
- The Chinese?

513
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,665
Darn right!

514
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,587
They cooked a delicious bass!

515
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,783
There were boxes everywhere

516
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,579
and they put me in the trunk!

517
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,699
Both coming and going.

518
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,783
I need some sleep.

519
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,658
Here.

520
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,625
I have to sleep a few hours.

521
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,665
What's this money?

522
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,625
Where did you get it?

523
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,705
I have to sleep.

524
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,580
Help me understand.

525
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,705
I talked to my son this morning,

526
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,587
he said: "Mom I'm leaving,

527
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,745
I'm going to be a secessionist."

528
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,620
Really?

529
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,585
What did you say?

530
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,660
He's convinced,

531
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,665
he said: "We're great,

532
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,662
we'll win the war,
the others are nobodies".

533
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,746
War? A bunch of morons
warring against us?

534
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,625
You have to stop him.

535
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,705
This side is the right side.

536
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,659
Have you seen what's happening?

537
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,745
There are killings every day.

538
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,586
Don't say anything to anybody,
not even your husband.

539
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,705
Who'd ever tell him!

540
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,740
When he gets out, what'll he do?
Father and son will kill each other?

541
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,625
No, because your son
will stay right here.

542
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,745
They'II all come to a bad end.

543
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,619
Do you feel so sure about that?

544
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,783
I don't.

545
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,625
I do.

546
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,542
When will we see each other again?

547
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,540
When you change sides.

548
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,665
Want to stay faithful? Go ahead!

549
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,659
You go your way and I go another.

550
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,588
But we can still have
a pizza together with friends.

551
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,545
I'm telling you again,

552
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,545
friend, enemy.

553
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,546
We've known each other for so long,
why go with them?

554
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,666
Remember when we were brothers?
Now we're enemies.

555
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,622
I'm telling you, if you don't
change sides, we might kill you

556
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,665
or you might kill us.

557
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,705
Because we're at war,

558
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,619
people are dying every day.

559
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,701
- You could have stayed with us...
- What for?

560
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,745
I'm best on the other side.

561
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,658
Bye, Simone.

562
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,619
Want a little Sambuca?

563
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,705
You'll be right off, don't worry.

564
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,665
Takes time.

565
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,665
Careful when you go out.

566
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,580
Thank you.

567
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,745
Gaetano, show him.

568
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,739
- It's big.
- You're right.

569
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,703
- Enzo!
- What?

570
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,547
Do I have to tell you?

571
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,665
It's awesome.

572
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,658
I like it.

573
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,585
Like it?

574
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,585
You look great.

575
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,540
Toto, show it off.

576
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,664
It's really nice.

577
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,779
- How many so far?
- 45 doses.

578
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,703
Okay.

579
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,585
It's good stuff.

580
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,585
How many so far?

581
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,744
Fifty-two,

582
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,621
plus four that guy's still got.

583
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,545
- Understand?
- Yeah.

584
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,665
I'II get back to you later.

585
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,541
- How many?
- Fifty-two and that guy's got four.

586
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,585
Then we'II total it.

587
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,665
Hello!

588
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,783
Nice, eh?

589
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,620
Hi, gorgeous!

590
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,584
Girls!

591
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,624
Beautiful!

592
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,778
Alessia?

593
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,667
What are you doing here? Get out.

594
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,744
I don't want to see you around here.

595
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,581
We have to go crying
at the prison gates?

596
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,547
What I went through with your father
was enough for me.

597
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,704
Good morning, Jacob.

598
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,587
- Are you alright?
- Fine, thank you, and you?

599
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,625
Have a good trip?

600
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,699
A very nice trip.

601
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,620
- Do you have documents?
- It's humanitarian aid.

602
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,665
Yes, it's humanitarian aid.

603
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,542
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

604
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,745
They've already called an ambulance.

605
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,783
Get back to work!

606
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,580
Go back to work!

607
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,739
What happened?

608
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,620
As they were dumping,

609
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,581
two drums opened
and spilled on a truck driver.

610
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,779
- Have you already called Zio?
- No!

611
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,626
- They wanted to call an ambulance!
- I'll take care of this.

612
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,784
Pay the truckers
and tell them to fuck off.

613
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,588
- Who'll drive the trucks?
- Don't the blacks know how?

614
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,660
Can you drive?

615
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,666
They can't even ride bikes!

616
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,580
I'll handle this.

617
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,626
Don't let them touch the trucks,
they're ours.

618
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,585
Roberto, wait here.

619
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,698
Calm down!

620
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:58,703
You made a mistake, you had us doing
a job we shouldn't have!

621
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,745
It just happened!

622
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,580
- I'm taking the red one.
- No, that's mine!

623
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,786
- Take that one.
- I'll take this one!

624
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,744
- I'm not tall enough!
- Climb up there!

625
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,699
Wake up, get some cushions!

626
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,740
- The keys?
- Look under the seat!

627
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,705
Come on! Are you sleeping?

628
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,699
Can't you see there's work to do?

629
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,819
Put this under your butt!

630
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,665
Put it under your butt.

631
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,785
Go slowly
and drive the truck down there.

632
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,620
Then I'll pay you.

633
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,785
Catch this cushion.

634
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,626
Come on!

635
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,665
Go slow!

636
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,739
Move forward
and make space for that one!

637
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,625
Roberto, tell him what to do!

638
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,665
All the way down there!

639
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,741
- What is it?
- It's the new list.

640
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,745
Have you already paid
the Mellone family?

641
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,785
And the redhead's family too?

642
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,920
Of course.

643
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,817
Wasted money.

644
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,582
Let's make not make these mistakes
anymore.

645
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,699
Are these the only ones?

646
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,699
More money and less work.

647
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,625
But more risk.

648
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,665
What risk?

649
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,739
Just don't go into certain areas,

650
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,707
the Seven Buildings, the Smurf Houses
and the Blue Houses.

651
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,661
As for the rest, you can go anywhere.

652
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,587
Maria's not here, I already paid her.

653
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,701
- Isn't her husband with us?
- Yes, but her son betrayed.

654
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,745
They mustn't get a cent.

655
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,740
These things are none of your affair,
respect the list.

656
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,783
Who is it?

657
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:21,704
What is it?

658
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,661
- Not letting me in?
- Tell me.

659
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,785
No one's home.

660
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,664
The week's pay.

661
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,700
- Sure, but no one's home.
- I'll leave it with you.

662
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,779
Just a minute and I'll let you in.

663
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,625
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

664
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,621
- You came by yourself?
- I'm alone!

665
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,585
I'm alone.

666
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,786
You can give this pittance
to your cronies, hear me?

667
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,785
Where's the list?

668
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,785
Don't move!

669
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,619
Put your hands on the floor.

670
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,617
You put our names
together with your cronies'?

671
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,704
Motherfucker!

672
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,659
We hate those people.

673
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,700
Tell your friends that we'll come
get them in their homes

674
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,825
and we'll shoot them
in the head like you!

675
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,741
- How did you get here?
- On my motorbike.

676
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,707
- Now I'll shoot him.
- Not in here.

677
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,785
Go get your bike.

678
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,659
Is anyone here?

679
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,778
Leave now!

680
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,778
Don Ciro!

681
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,785
What an idiot.

682
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,746
Don Ciro!
Where in hell are you going?

683
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,704
He's nuts.

684
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,705
You're acting like a skittish horse,

685
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,660
where are you running to?

686
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,581
You made me take the steps
four at a time.

687
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,739
What can we do with you?

688
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:54,785
Why are you running?

689
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,704
A wild horse is what you seem.

690
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,705
When will we talk a little?

691
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,665
Not even answering?

692
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,661
I've got to see
what to do with this guy,

693
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,740
I have to blast him.

694
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,746
What did you give me?
The same money again?

695
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,819
Is this guy an idiot?

696
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,705
Or are they making him
be an asshole?

697
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,705
Waiting for me to lose my head?

698
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,785
What can I do?

699
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,665
Let's do a stick-up?

700
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,784
A stick-up.

701
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,665
- What?
- A stick-up.

702
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,661
- No way!
- Let's do it!

703
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,825
- Stick-up a video games room?
- Our money's run out.

704
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,626
- What can this place have?
- Money!

705
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,587
Listen to me for once.

706
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,739
Cut the bullshit!

707
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,746
- A hold-up, no way!
- Listen to me.

708
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,741
Let's play one more Euro and go home.

709
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,819
We're out of money!

710
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,824
They must have about 50 cents.

711
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,659
Do we do it or not?

712
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,824
You get that one and
I'll take these guys down.

713
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,661
- See all the people.
- It'll work!

714
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,620
Something fast.

715
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,620
Are you ready?

716
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:31,783
Yes or no?

717
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,779
This is a hold-up!

718
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,700
On the floor!

719
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,778
Get out of there!

720
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,779
- She's hot!
- She sucks.

721
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,785
What!

722
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,621
- You like her?
- What's not to like!

723
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:41,626
You like one thing, I like another.

724
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,580
Right now!

725
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,784
- The blonde in the side room?
- Yeah.

726
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,818
Hillary?

727
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,824
Right away!

728
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,665
I can't even stand still.

729
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,739
I'll let you back in later.

730
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,581
- What's your name?
- Kristal.

731
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,627
- What do you want to do?
- Everything.

732
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,708
Have you ever stripped a girl?
I'll teach you.

733
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,667
- You're the first.
- You go really slow.

734
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:38,578
- I'm too horny.
- Sure, but you have to go slow.

735
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,705
You have to strip right away.

736
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,699
What do we do?

737
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,817
Want to have sex?

738
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,783
Wait!

739
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,704
Such a hurry!

740
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:20,777
Did I hurt you?

741
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,820
- Why not?
- Don't bite, it hurts.

742
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,665
Hey, zip up!

743
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,698
Zip up!

744
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,820
- Look, I'll call...
- Call who you want.

745
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,584
Zip up!

746
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,823
Come here!

747
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,705
- Now!
- You do it.

748
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,667
- Like this?
- It's not allowed.

749
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,743
Or I'll leave.

750
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,619
Come here, I zipped.

751
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,743
I'm gonna hurt you.

752
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,587
No, I'm doing the hurting to you.

753
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,661
- Really?
- What do you think?

754
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,785
Don't do anything to me!

755
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,627
Where are the weapons?

756
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,586
I'll give you one day
to put them back!

757
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,783
Get the message?

758
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,820
- Do I shoot them in the head?
- Let them live a little more.

759
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,625
Get back in the car.

760
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,777
Get the message?

761
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,777
Sweet Pea, get up!

762
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,583
Don't be scared, I'm here,
we're at war!

763
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,704
Get lost!

764
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,586
Get up!

765
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:28,704
Enough!

766
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,665
Come here, don't worry!

767
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,699
- I'm getting out of here.
- No!

768
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,779
We'll beat these guys!

769
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,823
Listen to me!

770
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,779
You're making me waste time,

771
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,586
you said you made a mark,
but where is it?

772
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,580
Oh, what is it?

773
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,622
- Remember I made a mark!
- Yeah, but you can't find it!

774
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,745
You're as dumb as they come.

775
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,737
Took you half an hour!

776
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:37,580
Let's move, I have to shoot,

777
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:39,705
I can't stand not shooting!

778
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:41,777
- Want to shoot?
- Right away!

779
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,626
- Did you load it?
- You'd better shut up.

780
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,665
Sweet Pea, do like I tell you.

781
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:54,617
I don't give a fuck what you think.

782
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,660
We break everyone's balls,
but who've we killed?

783
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,745
Do like I say and get moving!

784
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,703
Move!

785
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:04,740
Where are we going?

786
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,705
Do I have to beat you up?

787
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,784
Do we have to war with each other?

788
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,622
I'm not warring with you,
all we have to do is shoot!

789
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:18,780
- We're going to shoot alone?
- Yeah, just you and me!

790
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,740
- Not thinking about later?
- I don't want to think a thing!

791
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,617
Want to take the wrong steps,
we'll never grow that way.

792
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,739
Listening to you, we'll die sooner.

793
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,625
Can I say something?

794
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:37,628
Those kids don't know how to behave,
they're just raising Cain.

795
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,587
- Why?
- They didn't give the weapons back.

796
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:41,817
They don't want to listen.

797
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,705
I'll make them listen my way.

798
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,580
I'll take these guys and kill them.

799
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,620
If you kill two kids,

800
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:57,746
what shits will we look like
in the territory

801
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,627
when people find out?

802
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,665
Are we joking?

803
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,827
Then the cops come,
we have to lay low for a month

804
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,665
and all the traffic ends.

805
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,708
Zio Vittorio, they can't be
lording it around in my area,

806
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,668
they've already done so much,
I've warned them more than once.

807
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,739
I can't consider them kids anymore.

808
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,699
They have to die, that's final!

809
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,668
You're right,
but first let's tell the families.

810
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,705
I don't know who they are.

811
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,666
Will you take care of it?

812
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,825
I'll handle it!

813
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,783
Toto, is that you?

814
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,786
- What happened to Silvana?
- In the storeroom.

815
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,627
How come it's so dark?

816
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,665
Why are you in the dark?

817
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,585
It's okay like this.

818
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,660
Your change.

819
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,701
- The bread?
- There wasn't any.

820
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,701
- What'll we eat?
- There's pasta.

821
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,587
- Take your change.
- It's for you.

822
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,824
Why did you put her
in the storeroom?

823
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,625
She's fine where she is.

824
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,661
She's just an animal!

825
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,745
Come here a minute,
I have to talk to you.

826
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,625
Don't come out, it's dangerous.

827
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,785
Come on, no one can see you.

828
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,665
What are you doing, you're going?

829
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,586
Listen to me!

830
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,627
They said I have to leave.

831
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,779
I have to leave my house.

832
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,665
I can't do anything.

833
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,705
I'm not leaving!

834
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,665
Come here a minute!

835
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:06,780
Tell those friends of yours,
I'm not leaving!

836
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,699
Tell those nice people!

837
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,622
I won't betray my son
and I'm not moving from here!

838
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,659
Not coming in for coffee?

839
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,585
Run off, run away!

840
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:00,777
Hello, accountant.

841
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,704
Please come in.

842
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,786
Why this sudden call?

843
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,737
You're worrying me.

844
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,625
The designers pay me after 60 days,

845
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,745
I have a little money,

846
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,582
but this wasn't the agreement.

847
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,705
Money isn't the problem.

848
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,665
What is it then?

849
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,660
It seems

850
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,745
the problem is in your own house.

851
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,700
In my house?

852
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,745
What problem is it?

853
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,740
One of your associates,

854
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:37,658
Pasquale Del Prete,

855
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,620
has sold out to the Chinese.

856
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,625
We're done.

857
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,737
The finishing touches...

858
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,625
I never doubted.

859
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,625
Everything okay?

860
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,746
Remember the first time
I put you to work in the factory?

861
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,740
You were just a kid.

862
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,824
Right.

863
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,779
- Everything alright?
- Yes.

864
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,700
Tell him to go slower, not too fast.

865
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,783
Well done, Giulia.

866
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,738
She's good.

867
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,659
In the morning I do Tai Chi.

868
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:09,738
Really?

869
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,818
- It's nice.
- It is good for your health.

870
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,705
It is like in China.

871
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,622
When you go to the park
in the morning, it is full of people

872
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,660
old people too.

873
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,619
All doing Tai Chi.

874
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:27,823
Everyone

875
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,627
likes the culture of Tai Chi.

876
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,779
It's a tradition of Chinese culture.

877
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,699
When will you do egg rolls for me?

878
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,620
Wait up.

879
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,746
I spoke to the doctors,
you'll soon be released.

880
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,665
Damn you,

881
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,700
you really goofed up.

882
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:56,628
They loved the models,
they've asked for more...

883
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,620
You knew everything.

884
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,779
That's how I saved your life.

885
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,627
Those people don't kid around.

886
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,625
Leave me alone.

887
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:10,622
You should thank me,
those guys will kill you.

888
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,705
You and I pulled through.

889
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,780
- Find another tailor.
- Why do you say that?

890
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:19,666
- I want to be alone.
- How can I do this without you?

891
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,660
I really don't care.

892
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,628
- After all I've done for you.
- What have you done for me?

893
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,780
I took you off the streets,
I fed you for years.

894
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,580
- You've used me since I was a kid.
- Don't say that!

895
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,826
When you're better,
come see me, I'll give you a raise.

896
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:42,662
Rosa, give me that bike,
I have to go.

897
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,819
No admittance here,

898
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,777
that's it.

899
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,785
Want to give up?

900
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,744
Are we meat for the slaughter house?

901
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,579
Let's shoot,
we'll rack up corpses too.

902
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,778
Corpses?

903
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,577
- I'm not moving without orders.
- What orders?

904
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,745
We don't know how to move.

905
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,705
We don't know anything.

906
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,587
Do we have to keep taking it?

907
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,779
Do we have to wait for orders?

908
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,745
Let's rack up corpses.

909
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:10,662
What are we waiting for,
to be put down one by one?

910
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,744
If we don't move, nothing will change

911
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,819
No use feeling depressed.

912
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:22,745
We all have to be convinced.

913
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,661
But without orders, I'm not moving.

914
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,785
This is open war,

915
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,579
you mustn't think about anyone.

916
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:35,746
- Who do we kill?
- Let's begin in our area.

917
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,779
From our own stronghold.

918
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,744
We don't know who's with us
and who's against us,

919
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,819
who do we make pay?

920
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:47,666
Where do you think
the order to kill came from?

921
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,818
Think!

922
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,585
Where did it come from?

923
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,621
- From there of course.
- From our own area.

924
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,665
She betrayed us.

925
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,785
We don't touch women.

926
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,703
Don't yell!

927
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,699
What are you saying?

928
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:11,702
Don't take it out on someone
no part of this, but the son.

929
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,617
- How do we find him?
- His mother's in our district.

930
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,625
It was her son who killed Gaetano.

931
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,705
Let's think what we'll do.

932
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:22,745
We could use the kid.

933
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,665
He's the only one who can get to her.

934
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,700
He brings her shopping,

935
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,825
he's in good with the woman...

936
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,739
So, if we have to do it

937
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,785
we'll need his help.

938
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,619
Toto, what do you think you'll do?

939
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,785
Are you with us or against us?

940
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,585
What do you say?

941
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,739
Are you with us or not?

942
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,586
- We'll see what we can do.
- No, "we'll see".

943
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,705
Either you're with us
or you're against us,

944
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,625
one or the other.

945
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:09,628
If you're against us you can't leave,
we can't trust you.

946
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:11,779
It can't have been her.

947
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,665
This is our decision,

948
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,705
you have to be with us.

949
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,780
That's what we say,
you don't need to think.

950
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,665
What are you going to do?

951
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,746
- We'll see.
- I said no "we'll see".

952
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,698
Come on down.

953
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,745
I have to tell you something!

954
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,585
No, come down!

955
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,745
Hurry, I have to leave!

956
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,778
Sit down!

957
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,665
You've known me for years,

958
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,785
you know what I've always done.

959
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:19,585
I brought the money.

960
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,705
I brought it to your family too.

961
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,705
I did it because I was ordered to.

962
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,659
War isn't for me.

963
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:35,661
But you're in it, know that?

964
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:38,744
Yes.

965
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,626
So?

966
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,620
You tell me.

967
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,580
What can I tell you?

968
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:50,627
What did you come here for?

969
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:53,777
To talk to you.

970
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:55,783
About what?

971
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,625
I want to save myself.

972
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,779
You'll have to buy your life,

973
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,585
I won't give it to you.

974
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,745
What I did there,

975
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,739
I can do for you here.

976
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,665
We don't need money-carriers,

977
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:21,780
we have to score,
kill people, and we need money.

978
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,700
You're wasting your time.

979
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,700
You're more dead than alive.

980
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,667
But we were brothers before.

981
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:33,738
Before!

982
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,741
Then they started
messing around with shit.

983
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,705
Our relatives were good people...

984
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:46,705
so they killed them!

985
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:49,783
So, don't come asking

986
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:51,777
to pass to the other side.

987
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,665
We have to score, kill,

988
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,705
and we need money.

989
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:58,777
If not, you die,

990
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,619
because you're part of the war.

991
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,659
You bring money and I kill people,

992
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,621
we're the same, you and me,
in this war.

993
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,739
- I understand.
- You understand.

994
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,777
Wait a moment.

995
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,740
Everything okay?

996
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,705
And you?

997
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:06,625
That's four.

998
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,745
Face on the table!

999
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,783
Done?

1000
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,784
Let's go!

1001
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,580
Come on out!

1002
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,745
Lucky, eh?

1003
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,665
That's poison.

1004
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:02,819
What'd he say?

1005
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:06,746
My father wants to say the dumping
you're doing on our land

1006
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,737
isn't garbage.

1007
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:10,737
It's poison.

1008
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:12,785
It's not garbage?

1009
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:15,823
You heard right.

1010
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:17,777
Don't worry.

1011
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:21,666
A year's gone by with this dumping?

1012
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,701
So far,
all we've done is pay our debts.

1013
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,824
Just barely.

1014
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:31,780
- Euro.
- I understand, Don Raffaele.

1015
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,784
Everything costs double in Euro.

1016
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:38,778
And so?

1017
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,817
We need something more.

1018
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:46,621
These are the prices,
explain it to your kids,

1019
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:49,666
if I do it for you,
I have to do it for everyone.

1020
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,705
Don't put me
in a difficult situation.

1021
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:55,668
Okay, if you give us more,
everyone has to get more.

1022
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,665
So, little can be done.

1023
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:59,819
But, we barely make ends meet,

1024
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,665
we can't go on like this.

1025
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,705
We were thinking,

1026
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:08,746
is it possible to do more dumping?

1027
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,620
Euro...

1028
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,779
More dumping?

1029
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:18,586
We have another piece of land
for other dumping sites.

1030
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:19,817
Near here?

1031
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,625
Around here.

1032
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,625
More dumping we do,

1033
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:26,739
faster the ground gets filled.

1034
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:29,627
You have another piece of land?

1035
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:32,779
- Near here?
- Further on.

1036
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:36,620
This other land
would be more convenient,

1037
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:39,660
it's bigger and trucks
can get in easier.

1038
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,586
But...

1039
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:46,579
Still 100 Euros per dumping.

1040
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,625
What do you mean 100 Euros!

1041
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,705
Don't speak out of turn.

1042
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,739
- He can't increase!
- Who said so?

1043
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:55,619
We'll increase the trucks.

1044
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:59,746
You have to increase
the price of each dumping.

1045
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,665
Want to lose everything?

1046
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,785
They have nowhere else to turn.

1047
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,624
Excuse me.

1048
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:08,585
Don't worry.

1049
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,785
Alright, now we'll reach...

1050
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,620
an agreement.

1051
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,745
Give him a glass of water.

1052
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,819
I'll do it, don't worry.

1053
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:33,664
Luca!

1054
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,785
You have to clean up this field!

1055
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,580
I'm not Luca.

1056
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:47,665
Do a little work.

1057
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,660
My name's Roberto.

1058
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,785
This field is such a mess.

1059
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:56,625
All such a mess.

1060
01:49:57,680 --> 01:49:58,817
Ma'am, it's raining.

1061
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,703
Should I stop?

1062
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,740
Come out of there.

1063
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:08,585
I'll take you inside.

1064
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,705
I'll be right along.

1065
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,785
They've made ditches here,

1066
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,619
someone should come

1067
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,665
to fill them.

1068
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,704
Let's go!

1069
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,660
What beautiful peaches, thank you!

1070
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,705
I'll take them to the kids.

1071
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,785
See how beautiful they are!

1072
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,660
Let's go.

1073
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,785
Put them in the car.

1074
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,626
Come on!

1075
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,625
Toss that stuff.

1076
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,745
- What?
- The peaches.

1077
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,819
Can't you smell how they stink?

1078
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:37,817
Done?

1079
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:55,824
What?

1080
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:57,664
Listen,

1081
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:00,625
I've been thinking.

1082
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,739
Maybe I'm not cut out for this work.

1083
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,660
What?

1084
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,625
I mean it.

1085
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:10,705
I'm not up to it.

1086
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,825
We're doing so well!

1087
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,624
No,

1088
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,823
I don't want to work anymore,

1089
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:19,698
I'm sorry.

1090
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,619
Think this job sucks?

1091
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:32,702
You know that guys like me
put this shit country in Europe?

1092
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:35,786
Know how many workers I've helped
by saving their companies money?

1093
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:37,743
Stop and look!

1094
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:40,740
What do you see?

1095
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,778
Debts.

1096
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:47,586
All these people have been saved
only thanks to us.

1097
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,659
I saw how you help them live.

1098
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,746
You save a worker in Mestre
and kill a family in Mondragone.

1099
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:57,661
That's how it works,
but I didn't decide it.

1100
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,739
We solve problems created by others.

1101
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:03,699
I didn't create
chromium and asbestos,

1102
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,739
I didn't dig up the mountain.

1103
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:07,823
That's how it works?

1104
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:10,625
I don't work that way.

1105
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:12,783
I'm not like you.

1106
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,744
- What are you like?
- I'm different.

1107
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,705
Go make pizzas!

1108
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,705
He's different.

1109
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,699
Don't think you're better than me!

1110
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,739
I gave you a chance!

1111
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:35,743
Go fuck yourself!

1112
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:36,780
I think Scarlett Johansson's here!

1113
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,625
Splendid, magnificent,

1114
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,745
all dressed in white,

1115
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:45,818
cream.

1116
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:48,659
In style with the film.

1117
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,786
Right colors,
right choice of dress.

1118
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:57,780
It would be nice to know
why it took so long to get ready...

1119
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:01,783
Because it's chic

1120
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:05,585
yet so sophisticated.

1121
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:09,707
An apparent simplicity,
but in reality, very elaborate...

1122
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,700
Allow me to say...

1123
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:15,702
Maybe to be awaited as a true star.

1124
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,739
She's a star, and so beautiful.

1125
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,825
The photographers are going crazy.

1126
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,740
And the people too...

1127
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,819
May I sit at your table?

1128
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:41,627
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- We don't smoke.

1129
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:45,665
Everyone here talks about you.

1130
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:48,784
You kids have balls, I can use you.

1131
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:52,779
Why don't you join my guys?

1132
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,745
You'll have money, motorbikes,

1133
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:57,785
anything you want.

1134
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:00,619
I already saved you once,

1135
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:02,705
because here
they don't like you guys.

1136
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:05,665
You're causing too much trouble.

1137
01:57:06,640 --> 01:57:08,619
It's wise to be with me,

1138
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:10,625
that way you don't have to worry,
you're covered.

1139
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,739
We want to stay alone,

1140
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:16,582
we don't want to be under anyone.

1141
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:18,785
We don't like to be under people.

1142
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,705
We're just for us, that's all.

1143
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,785
May I confide in you?

1144
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,779
It's obvious you're courageous.

1145
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:31,665
You're not talking to cops.

1146
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:33,784
What is it?

1147
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:38,588
I have a good job for you
and you'll earn a barrel of money.

1148
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:40,784
- Money?
- Money's the first thing.

1149
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:42,703
We know.

1150
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,780
- May I come closer?
- Sure.

1151
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,741
It's something not to be overheard,
just between us.

1152
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:53,739
I need a big favor,

1153
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,785
you could do a "job" for me.

1154
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:58,665
I see you've got balls,

1155
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:02,662
but this guy's a hot one, he's big.

1156
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:05,779
We really like these things.

1157
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:07,743
I'm crazy for them.

1158
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,699
You have to kill Peppe the Horseman.

1159
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:13,621
He's a traitor, he took my woman.

1160
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:17,817
You have to shoot him in the balls

1161
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:20,585
and then in the mouth.

1162
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:22,745
I go crazy for these things.

1163
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,659
But you have to do me a favor.

1164
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:30,748
They told me you
stole some weapons from around here.

1165
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,824
You have to give them back,
we gotta make them disappear.

1166
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:37,744
- I'll give you the weapons.
- You will?

1167
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:40,741
Weapons, motorbikes,
anything you want.

1168
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:42,785
Let's talk about the money.

1169
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:46,586
Tell me what you want
for this job.

1170
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:48,705
A really good amount.

1171
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:51,582
Is 10,000 Euro enough?

1172
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:54,744
Yes.

1173
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:57,741
I'll give you an advance,
the rest when the job's done.

1174
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,700
Put it in your pocket.

1175
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:13,627
- Is it right?
- Fine.

1176
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,700
- Not there.
- Then where?

1177
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:47,740
- Where the fuck do we go?
- Who knows where he went!

1178
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:52,744
- We lost him.
- Are you sure?

1179
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:57,741
- Look over there.
- There's nothin'.

1180
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,660
Then where?

1181
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,823
There he is!

1182
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:51,580
Get off.

1183
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:06,778
Come on!

1184
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,707
For two kids such a waste of time.

1185
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:13,700
Guys, it had to be done.

1186
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,700
Everything's okay.

1187
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:04,826
In Europe the Camorra has killed more
than all other criminal organizations

1188
02:06:05,680 --> 02:06:08,660
4,000 deaths in the last thirty years
One every three days.

1189
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:12,617
Scampia is the biggest
drug-pushing locality in the world.

1190
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:15,700
Daily sales per clan
run about 500,000 Euro.

1191
02:06:16,640 --> 02:06:19,666
If clan-managed waste were piled
it would reach 14,600 meters.

1192
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:21,705
Everest is 8,850 meters.

1193
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:24,701
There is a 20% increase in cancer
in the poisoned areas.

1194
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:29,667
Gains from illegal activities are
reinvested in legal ones worldwide.

1195
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:33,708
The Camorra has also invested in the
reconstruction of the Twin Towers.
