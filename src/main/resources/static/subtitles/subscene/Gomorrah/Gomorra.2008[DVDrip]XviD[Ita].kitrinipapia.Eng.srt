1
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,359
How long you are gonna be in?

2
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,437
I'm coming out right now,

3
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,445
you're a pain in the neck!

4
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,364
Hey, Americano.

5
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,405
I'm still here, getting a manicure.

6
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,446
Things okay?

7
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,404
Getting tanned? Don't get burned!

8
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,285
Bruno is here too.

9
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,359
You got a crap body!

10
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,479
Bruno is here?

11
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,398
He is over there.

12
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,399
You are doing the lamp?

13
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,363
It's 2,000.

14
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,327
How much are you
supposed to get this week?

15
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,478
9,200.

16
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,286
Sure? It was less last week.

17
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,325
Yes, Don Ciro 9,200.

18
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,325
Another 2,000 Euro and we're even.

19
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,285
Don Ciro, don't take all day.

20
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,245
He's slow.

21
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,365
Hurry, so we can go home.

22
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,285
Things okay out there?

23
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,483
Keep your eyes open.

24
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,437
That's it.

25
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,405
Put paper cups in.

26
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,483
Toilet paper.

27
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,247
- Then, Mom?
- Some shampoo.

28
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,443
A mozzarella...

29
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,325
Shampoo, not bath oil!

30
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,281
You're rushin' me!

31
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,359
And you're drivin' me crazy!

32
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,246
Hurry up, there are
more groceries to deliver.

33
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,285
- Nothing else?
- No.

34
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,406
- Be back later.
- Don't get yourself lost.

35
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,485
- Simone.
- Toto, what's up?

36
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,286
- What's happening?
- I'm workin'.

37
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,440
Know what happened?
They arrested Vitale and Bon Bon.

38
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,318
Really?

39
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,400
- Got somethin' to eat?
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

40
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,365
Bye, see you.

41
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,325
Carmela, ma'am!

42
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,483
Hi, Boxer.

43
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,319
Two doses, two doses!

44
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,325
Please, give me a dose!

45
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,280
Gaetano, check it!

46
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,245
One, two, three...

47
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,444
Goodbye.

48
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,445
Don Ciro, be more punctual.

49
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,280
I'll pass it on.

50
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,358
Eleven and twelve.

51
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,279
See if he wants coffee.

52
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,359
No, but thank you anyway...

53
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,325
I'll show you out.

54
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,280
Have a good day.

55
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,286
Four hundred...

56
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,478
Five hundred.

57
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,359
The same amount again?

58
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,366
I've said a hundred times
I can't manage like this.

59
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,358
Don Carlo...

60
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,242
Did you tell them I can't manage
on this chickenfeed?

61
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,281
I have to pay rent, lights, water.

62
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,241
I can't survive,
I'm strapped with debts.

63
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,360
- I'll pass it on.
- You always say that!

64
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,241
Are you mockin' me?

65
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,443
I don't get it!

66
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,443
Listen,

67
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,325
I've got a son to support,

68
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,366
for forty years
I've kept him off the streets,

69
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,325
he's unemployed.

70
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,400
What can I do,
go over to the other side?

71
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,288
They know, I served you honestly
for forty years.

72
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,406
My wife's in jail,
is this the thanks we get?

73
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,240
Are we crazy?
Do I have to raise hell?

74
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,404
Silvana!

75
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,246
May I?

76
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,478
Come on in!

77
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,318
Maria!

78
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,246
The bill?

79
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,399
Talk to Mom.

80
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,320
Put this in your pocket.

81
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,286
Thank you.

82
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,325
Carabinieri on the street!

83
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,405
He's comin' out!

84
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,247
I'm the best, number one!

85
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,443
So?

86
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,364
Go, Marco!

87
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,442
- I'll blast these roaches!
- Who do you think you're fighting?

88
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,240
I'm number one! Tony Montana!

89
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,359
The world is ours!

90
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,321
You don't know
who you're up against!

91
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,359
I'm Tony Montana!

92
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,287
- I'm the powerhouse!
- Yeah!

93
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,404
Come here.

94
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,279
Shit Colombians,

95
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,280
they're everywhere.

96
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,247
See, Colombians everywhere.

97
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,242
You really looked like Scarface.

98
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,280
You were good.

99
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,484
Now it all has to be ours,
the whole world.

100
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,325
Miami, all of it.

101
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,399
My friend, got stuff?

102
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,483
You got stuff?

103
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,361
- Got good stuff?
- You got money?

104
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,282
- Sure, you got coke?
- What do you want to pay?

105
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,405
Me? 50.

106
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,440
- 55, can you do it?
- No, 55 is too much, 50.

107
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,445
You sure?

108
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,280
Wait here for me.

109
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,477
Where's Smarty?

110
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,398
Hey, kid!

111
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,240
Give him the money.

112
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,321
- Is it all here?
- Yeah.

113
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,242
- Okay?
- Yes.

114
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,361
- Want to see it?
- I want to try it.

115
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,483
I gave you the money!

116
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,398
Wait!

117
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,400
Open your hand.

118
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,324
It's good.

119
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,483
Give me all of it!

120
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,245
Grab the money!

121
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,325
Giovanni, I brought the kids.

122
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,444
Come in.

123
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,444
You know very well why you're here.

124
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,440
Too much ruckus going on in my area,
because I'm the boss here.

125
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,483
That's just you sayin'.

126
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,439
If I had you come here, I know.
No back-talk

127
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,404
or I'll smash your face!

128
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,446
- What happened?
- For the moment, nothing.

129
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,483
Get me?

130
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,327
I can't be made to look bad
because of two kids like you.

131
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,440
The next time
I hear anything about you,

132
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,443
I'll blow your heads off.

133
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,280
- If it's like you say...
- Shut up when I'm talking.

134
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,405
Then if I come to realize

135
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,405
you're worth something,

136
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,287
which I'll determine and I'll decide,

137
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,247
you can work for me.

138
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,399
Is that clear?

139
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,280
Show them out.

140
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,285
"I'll smash your face!"

141
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,405
And I'll tear your beard!

142
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,240
Without a T-shirt.

143
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,365
"Sweet Pea", looked like a bum.

144
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,444
A real bum.

145
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,446
He is a bum! Did you see
who he sent to get us?

146
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,399
If that guy's the boss here,

147
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,445
then here we can be the bosses.

148
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,360
If a guy like him is boss here,
this area is ours!

149
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,285
I'll live for 30 years
if he's boss here.

150
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,281
Sure, because he's a retard!

151
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,362
Get it? I'II live for 30 years.

152
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,242
But he could at least shave!

153
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,398
Shave!

154
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,325
"I'll smash your face!"

155
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,404
Let's go have a snort to spite him.

156
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,286
We've got everything,
we can do like we want.

157
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,281
Anyway, he's a fat shit-ass.

158
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,325
He bugged you?

159
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,445
He showers once a week!

160
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,405
"I'll blow your heads off!"

161
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,484
Roberto!

162
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,319
Let's go, it's too small.

163
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,288
- But the methane one's big.
- No, it's small.

164
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,448
- Can I finish measuring?
- No, we're wasting time.

165
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,328
- I have to take some shots.
- What a bore with these pictures!

166
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,280
Let's go!

167
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,320
Just look at this.

168
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,285
It's disgusting down there.

169
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,397
Here is perfect.

170
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,240
It's perfect.

171
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,480
We're near the highway,
the trucks can get really close,

172
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,246
they dump the earth
and cover all the water.

173
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,444
Perfect.

174
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,479
Franco, it's 85 meters.

175
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,245
Get the length too.

176
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,285
Come here.

177
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,284
Dante.

178
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,365
Hello, everything okay?

179
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,445
This is Roberto.

180
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,446
- It's time we made room for youth.
- We need new energy.

181
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,445
Take a few more shots.

182
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,325
Did you hear?

183
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,399
They bombed me,

184
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,365
at the cement plant.

185
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,479
A whole wall came down,

186
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,358
slowly.

187
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,365
Be careful.

188
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,405
Zio resolved it.

189
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,286
I'd forgotten to pay
for some land I'd bought.

190
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,321
- An injunction against payment?
- Yeah!

191
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,485
- What do you think?
- It's fine.

192
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,322
- Can we fill this quarry?
- Sure can.

193
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,365
Tell Zio it's fine.

194
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,408
Remember, everything clean:
Terracing, solid stuff...

195
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,400
Or the redevelopment agency
will break our balls.

196
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,440
Don't worry,
you emptied it and I'll fill it.

197
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,402
All the pieces have to be cut
and the sizes worked out.

198
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,359
They want 120 of these.

199
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,399
Six and seven are identical.

200
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,405
Here the satin is cut on the bias.

201
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,400
It's all hand-hemmed.

202
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,365
Is it tough?

203
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,406
The models aren't hard,
I can do it.

204
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,484
Eight hundred items in two months,
is our request.

205
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,246
Keep in mind
we start at 50 Euros per item.

206
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,400
You've seen the models,
the price is good,

207
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,287
estimate and make your offers.

208
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,485
Thirty Euro, 30 days?

209
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,279
Don't go any lower.

210
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,399
This is high fashion,
it's not pret-a-porter.

211
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,405
Forty-five, in two months.

212
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,405
- Ms. Zamarion!
- Yes?

213
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,479
Thirty-eight, forty.

214
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,325
That's a very interesting proposal.

215
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,320
Thirty-five, thirty-five,

216
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,366
excellent workmanship
and delivery times respected.

217
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,400
Thirty, thirty!

218
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,397
Please,

219
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,242
we're not imposing anything!

220
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,359
Did we say thirty, thirty?

221
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,360
At this point

222
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,360
twenty-eight, thirty!

223
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,320
Thirty, twenty-five!

224
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,365
I can't lose this bid.

225
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,479
Come here, there's some bubbly!

226
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,280
Are they coming?

227
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,484
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

228
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,241
Five days less for delivery,

229
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,241
we'll have to work overtime,
and I'II do nights...

230
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,319
What's odd about that?

231
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,365
They're talking overtime pay.

232
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,405
They'II get it!

233
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,406
Am I scared of a little overtime?

234
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,280
Like the last time?

235
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,399
Don't worry,
this time it's a sure thing.

236
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,367
- They've lost their trust.
- I know.

237
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,362
- I asked you to talk to them.
- You do it, please.

238
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,406
You're on closer terms,
they respect you.

239
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,365
Do me this favor.

240
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,439
Don't say no, go talk to them.

241
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,400
You know I'm fond of you,

242
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,445
I'll have to make
a gold statue to you!

243
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,287
I'll go down and see the accountant
for the money.

244
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,281
Sorry, how much is this?

245
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,363
Ten thousand.

246
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,365
It's not enough, I need more.

247
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,403
Twice that at least.

248
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,285
Mr. Enzo,
you're already "complicated".

249
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,405
Yes, but for personal affairs.

250
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,287
I need this for work.

251
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,405
I'II give it back in three months.

252
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,287
But this isn't enough.

253
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,439
If you don't need it
and it's not enough,

254
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,443
I'll take it back.

255
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,403
It's best for you.

256
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,319
Don't be like that, listen,

257
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,445
I need at least double!

258
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,245
It's no risk,

259
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,443
you'll earn from it, right?

260
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,358
What can I say?

261
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,281
I'll pass it on,
can you make-do for now?

262
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,365
Yes, I'II take it.

263
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,319
Congratulations, Mr. Pasquale.

264
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,438
Thank you.

265
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,443
We met yesterday.

266
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,399
I need your help.

267
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,445
I am having trouble with work.

268
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,401
I have to get into
haute couture right away,

269
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,325
but for me

270
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,279
it is very difficult.

271
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,365
I need help.

272
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,405
You are

273
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,279
a great master,

274
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,479
you are very important for me.

275
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,245
You teach ten lessons

276
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,247
to workers in my factory.

277
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,445
I pay you in cash,

278
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,439
2,000 Euros a lesson

279
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,477
for ten lessons.

280
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,480
We work together,
but no one knows it,

281
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,400
just the two of us.

282
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,285
I need your help.

283
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,280
Think it over.

284
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,327
- What's the cloth like?
- Come and see.

285
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,397
I've got nothin'!

286
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,445
Don't move!

287
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,401
They must have gone over to his side,

288
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,286
or they'd hsve arrested
me first and then those other guys.

289
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,446
Believe me? All of them were there
when I called you.

290
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,287
I said: Check out this car,
it's suspect.

291
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,325
This stuff here is ours.

292
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,325
My gun!

293
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,246
Check this stuff out,
there should be fifty-six.

294
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,359
Good, Toto, this is for you.

295
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,485
How can I get working with you?

296
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,279
We'll let you know.

297
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,444
- Did you turn off the water?
- Of course!

298
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,439
- Can I help out?
- No, you'll get wet.

299
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,403
Doesn't matter!

300
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,240
Come and see.

301
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,285
Careful not to slip.

302
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,288
- Is it coming from the well?
- No, I think it's from the pipe.

303
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,327
Careful, water's coming in.

304
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,247
See if you can close it.

305
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,365
It's closed,
but it's the pipe that...

306
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,479
I'd give you a hand, but...

307
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,443
What a great day!

308
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,285
Push it all in one direction.

309
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,241
I thought I'd be having coffee!

310
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,400
- Nice coffee, huh?
- I'll have some next time.

311
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,285
Totore, things okay?

312
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,401
- Can I say hi?
- No, you gotta leave.

313
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,242
Go down with these bags!

314
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,285
You have to move!

315
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,359
Ma'am, go around the other way.

316
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,366
- What's going on?
- Everything's fine, leave.

317
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,444
Lucia?

318
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,398
Come closer.

319
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,241
- What's your nsme?
- Luigi.

320
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,281
- Are you scared?
- No.

321
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,439
- Sure?
- No.

322
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,437
We'll see.

323
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,406
- Are you strong?
- Yeah!

324
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,405
Let's see how strong you are.

325
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,325
Why are you shaking?

326
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,240
No?

327
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,321
- See how strong this kid is.
- Come closer!

328
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,287
- Are you scared?
- Yes.

329
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,280
Now you're a man.

330
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,439
Nothin'! Everything's okay!

331
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,322
When I did my piercing,
I got an infection.

332
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,285
Let's see.

333
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,279
You went and did it there?

334
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,327
- I'd like to have it on my eyebrow.
- Stinks.

335
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,399
It's nicer there, you're right.

336
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,445
It's gonna rain.

337
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,398
Everything's okay!

338
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,479
A car's coming!

339
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,320
It went in!

340
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,365
It's going in!

341
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,279
Check out this other one!

342
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,360
Everything's okay!

343
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,400
Sorry I'm late, the Councilman,
City Hall, the traffic...

344
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,399
- My father.
- How do you do.

345
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,286
I'm glad he's with you
you're a good person.

346
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,399
He's in your care.

347
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,400
He's a clever guy.

348
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,437
I don't doubt that but...

349
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,361
- Having work is important to him.
- Of course.

350
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,321
I tried so hard
to find him work in Naples...

351
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,446
- Where do you work?
- In the hospital, intensive care.

352
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,325
A bad division.

353
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,441
I tried to get him in,
but I have no connections.

354
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,279
He's all set now.

355
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,281
You did something no one else did.

356
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,439
I thank you, you raised him well.

357
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,440
Have you always worked in Naples?

358
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,319
No, also in Trieste, Udine,

359
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,319
- Venice...
- That's where we're going.

360
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,366
I told him about Venice.

361
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:09,446
He's excited, it's his first time.

362
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,440
Dad, we have a plane.

363
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,285
Did you bring some things?

364
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,445
What's that, your gym bag?

365
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,327
- Goodbye.
- He's in your care.

366
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,282
- What do you pay for disposal?
- Today I'm paying 50.

367
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,483
Your offer?

368
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,285
We can halve your costs,

369
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,280
25 cents a kilo.

370
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,280
That's good,

371
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,359
but is it all "clean",
like they say in the United States?

372
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,365
Since it's toxic waste,

373
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,247
certification,
storage and transportation.

374
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,406
- Is there a contract to look over?
- Of course.

375
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,320
In case you're wondering,

376
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,399
the disposal cycle

377
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,287
goes to the dispossl area
in Marcianise.

378
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,285
I'm telling you in fairness.

379
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,439
Thank you for the information,

380
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,484
but my only concern
is that it's "clean".

381
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,325
You can rest assured of that.

382
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,399
We can dispose of all the waste

383
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,485
that you produce in a year.

384
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,403
Eight hundred tons.

385
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,284
It's not a problem.

386
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,483
That's a lot.

387
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,485
My concern is disposal.

388
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,439
We serve various companies,
you can check.

389
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,405
I already have!

390
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,320
Don't worry.

391
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,361
As far as I can see,
there's maximum transparency.

392
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,240
Absolutely.

393
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,446
- The warehouses at Teverola?
- We use them for tires.

394
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,324
Exactly.

395
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,401
Will we put the tannery waste
in the quarry?

396
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,242
- Don't talk foolishness.
- Where then?

397
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,365
Check the European catalogue.

398
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,320
Here they are,04.

399
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,439
The ones in red,
are among the most dangerous.

400
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,406
"Exhausted degreasing baths
with solvents, no liquid phase."

401
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,477
No, no good.

402
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,399
Then 4-11:

403
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,327
"Waste containing halogenated
compounds from operations

404
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,365
of manufacturing and finishing."

405
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,360
These are good.

406
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,237
It's stuff the earth absorbs,
we'll mix it with compost.

407
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,398
Fertilizer!

408
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,246
All that leaves is
Milan's sweeping refuse,

409
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,240
that's 60 trucks.

410
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,241
- The quarries at San Felice?
- They're too small.

411
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,285
I don't think so, look.

412
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,365
Let me see.

413
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,439
They're too small
and they're shallow,

414
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,365
they're no good.

415
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,277
Yes... I've got
ten contracts out of ten.

416
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,403
Is he near you?

417
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,363
Put him on.

418
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,397
I'll talk to him.

419
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,281
I told him, everything's okay.

420
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,281
- Do you like traveling?
- Sure!

421
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,440
We'll take more trips.

422
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,439
Everyone here works in boats?

423
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,280
Everyone, firemen, ambulances...

424
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,446
- Funerals.
- I've already seen two.

425
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,279
Even the dead go by boat!

426
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,439
Wow, they've got so many!

427
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,324
Steady me.

428
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,320
There's nothing here.

429
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,400
Nothing?

430
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,365
Are you sure?

431
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,320
Oh God!

432
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,325
Look what's here!

433
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,405
See? It's like you said!

434
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,285
Look here!

435
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,285
A Beretta 93!

436
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,245
A Kalashnikov!

437
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,439
See if they're loaded.

438
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,439
- Check.
- It's unloaded.

439
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,280
Look, an M12!

440
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,445
This is the 921.

441
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,363
That bearded bum!

442
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,485
We'll see how
he blows my head off!

443
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,486
Enough for Casale di Principe!
Everybody!

444
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,325
Won't blow my head off now, eh?

445
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,445
Should I put two in?

446
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,320
And Nikita's?

447
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,320
And the 38?

448
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,440
- Want to see how I can shoot?
- Show me!

449
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,325
Show me!

450
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,325
Aim there!

451
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,320
I hit it!

452
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,365
We'll blow
the Colombians' heads off!

453
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,325
That's good.

454
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,365
Everything okay?

455
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,325
With love and feeling.

456
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,439
- What is it?
- Your wife's on the phone.

457
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,483
Tell her not to wait up.

458
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,439
Don't get tired out, need anything?

459
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,403
No, thanks.

460
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,479
- You'll lock up?
- Yes.

461
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,404
Goodnight.

462
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,320
Xian?

463
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,443
I have been waiting for you.

464
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,480
- I got lost.
- I am happy you came.

465
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,358
Please sit down.

466
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,405
We are cooking fish.

467
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,285
I've already eaten.

468
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,365
Try a typical Chinese dish.

469
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,403
Okay?

470
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,327
Just cooked, it is good.

471
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,280
Meat with bell peppers.

472
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,325
I've already eaten.

473
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,438
Taste.

474
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,245
We use chopsticks.

475
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,365
- I don't know how to use them.
- Try!

476
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,325
I am pleased,

477
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,405
we have a little toast.

478
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,242
We go to the factory.

479
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,365
Why not?

480
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,325
I put a pillow in here.

481
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,325
It's dangerous.

482
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,282
I already told you,
no one can know, just us.

483
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,439
It's better for both of us.

484
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,327
- Won't I need air?
- No, there's an opening.

485
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,326
I'll open the front window,
so air will come in.

486
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,245
Forgive me.

487
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,483
Are we sure?

488
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,486
It is best for both of us,
because it is dangerous.

489
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,281
- Does air come through here?
- Yes.

490
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,479
And I'II open the window too.

491
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,279
Please come in, Mr. Pasquale.

492
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,445
All are waiting for you.

493
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,365
All are very happy.

494
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,439
I told them who you are
and all are happy.

495
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,240
What a nice factory!

496
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,445
More than 80 people.

497
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,365
I'm moved.

498
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,325
What can I say?

499
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,439
To do this work

500
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,242
you need lots of patience...

501
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,400
... and lots of love.

502
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,405
For the first lesson...

503
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,365
... I'II cut out a bodice.

504
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,438
Let's begin.

505
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,281
You must place patterns carefully.

506
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,439
Spread the cloth well...

507
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,325
Maria, are you asleep?

508
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,399
Where have I been, in China?

509
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,359
They were all bowing to me.

510
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,280
Master!

511
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:20,287
They called me "master"!

512
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,280
- Did you know the Chinese can cook?
- The Chinese?

513
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,365
Darn right!

514
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,287
They cooked a delicious bass!

515
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,483
There were boxes everywhere

516
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,279
and they put me in the trunk!

517
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,399
Both coming and going.

518
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,483
I need some sleep.

519
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,358
Here.

520
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,325
I have to sleep a few hours.

521
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:03,365
What's this money?

522
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,325
Where did you get it?

523
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,405
I have to sleep.

524
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,280
Help me understand.

525
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,405
I talked to my son this morning,

526
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,287
he said: "Mom I'm leaving,

527
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,445
I'm going to be a secessionist."

528
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,320
Really?

529
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,285
What did you say?

530
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,360
He's convinced,

531
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,365
he said: "We're great,

532
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,362
we'll win the war,
the others are nobodies".

533
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,446
War? A bunch of morons
warring against us?

534
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,325
You have to stop him.

535
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,405
This side is the right side.

536
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,359
Have you seen what's happening?

537
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,445
There are killings every day.

538
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,286
Don't say anything to anybody,
not even your husband.

539
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,405
Who'd ever tell him!

540
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,440
When he gets out, what'll he do?
Father and son will kill each other?

541
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,325
No, because your son
will stay right here.

542
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,445
They'II all come to a bad end.

543
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,319
Do you feel so sure about that?

544
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,483
I don't.

545
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,325
I do.

546
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,242
When will we see each other again?

547
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,240
When you change sides.

548
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,365
Want to stay faithful? Go ahead!

549
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,359
You go your way and I go another.

550
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,288
But we can still have
a pizza together with friends.

551
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,245
I'm telling you again,

552
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,245
friend, enemy.

553
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,246
We've known each other for so long,
why go with them?

554
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,366
Remember when we were brothers?
Now we're enemies.

555
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,322
I'm telling you, if you don't
change sides, we might kill you

556
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,365
or you might kill us.

557
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,405
Because we're at war,

558
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,319
people are dying every day.

559
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,401
- You could have stayed with us...
- What for?

560
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,445
I'm best on the other side.

561
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,358
Bye, Simone.

562
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,319
Want a little Sambuca?

563
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,405
You'll be right off, don't worry.

564
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,365
Takes time.

565
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,365
Careful when you go out.

566
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,280
Thank you.

567
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,445
Gaetano, show him.

568
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,439
- It's big.
- You're right.

569
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,403
- Enzo!
- What?

570
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,247
Do I have to tell you?

571
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,365
It's awesome.

572
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,358
I like it.

573
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,285
Like it?

574
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,285
You look great.

575
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,240
Toto, show it off.

576
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,364
It's really nice.

577
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:11,479
- How many so far?
- 45 doses.

578
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,403
Okay.

579
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,285
It's good stuff.

580
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,285
How many so far?

581
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,444
Fifty-two,

582
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,321
plus four that guy's still got.

583
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,245
- Understand?
- Yeah.

584
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,365
I'II get back to you later.

585
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,241
- How many?
- Fifty-two and that guy's got four.

586
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,285
Then we'II total it.

587
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,365
Hello!

588
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,483
Nice, eh?

589
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,320
Hi, gorgeous!

590
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,284
Girls!

591
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,324
Beautiful!

592
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,478
Alessia?

593
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,367
What are you doing here? Get out.

594
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,444
I don't want to see you around here.

595
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,281
We have to go crying
at the prison gates?

596
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,247
What I went through with your father
was enough for me.

597
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,404
Good morning, Jacob.

598
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,287
- Are you alright?
- Fine, thank you, and you?

599
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,325
Have a good trip?

600
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:40,399
A very nice trip.

601
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,320
- Do you have documents?
- It's humanitarian aid.

602
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,365
Yes, it's humanitarian aid.

603
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,242
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

604
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,445
They've already called an ambulance.

605
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,483
Get back to work!

606
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,280
Go back to work!

607
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,439
What happened?

608
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,320
As they were dumping,

609
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:15,281
two drums opened
and spilled on a truck driver.

610
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,479
- Have you already called Zio?
- No!

611
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,326
- They wanted to call an ambulance!
- I'll take care of this.

612
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:26,484
Pay the truckers
and tell them to fuck off.

613
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,288
- Who'll drive the trucks?
- Don't the blacks know how?

614
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,360
Can you drive?

615
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,366
They can't even ride bikes!

616
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,280
I'll handle this.

617
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,326
Don't let them touch the trucks,
they're ours.

618
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,285
Roberto, wait here.

619
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,398
Calm down!

620
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:59,403
You made a mistake, you had us doing
a job we shouldn't have!

621
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,445
It just happened!

622
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,280
- I'm taking the red one.
- No, that's mine!

623
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:00,486
- Take that one.
- I'll take this one!

624
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,444
- I'm not tall enough!
- Climb up there!

625
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,399
Wake up, get some cushions!

626
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:24,440
- The keys?
- Look under the seat!

627
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,405
Come on! Are you sleeping?

628
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,399
Can't you see there's work to do?

629
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,519
Put this under your butt!

630
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,365
Put it under your butt.

631
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,485
Go slowly
and drive the truck down there.

632
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,320
Then I'll pay you.

633
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,485
Catch this cushion.

634
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,326
Come on!

635
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,365
Go slow!

636
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,439
Move forward
and make space for that one!

637
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,325
Roberto, tell him what to do!

638
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,365
All the way down there!

639
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:01,441
- What is it?
- It's the new list.

640
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,445
Have you already paid
the Mellone family?

641
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,485
And the redhead's family too?

642
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:07,620
Of course.

643
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,517
Wasted money.

644
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,282
Let's make not make these mistakes
anymore.

645
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:15,399
Are these the only ones?

646
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,399
More money and less work.

647
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,325
But more risk.

648
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,365
What risk?

649
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,439
Just don't go into certain areas,

650
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:29,407
the Seven Buildings, the Smurf Houses
and the Blue Houses.

651
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:32,361
As for the rest, you can go anywhere.

652
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,287
Maria's not here, I already paid her.

653
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,401
- Isn't her husband with us?
- Yes, but her son betrayed.

654
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,445
They mustn't get a cent.

655
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,440
These things are none of your affair,
respect the list.

656
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:09,483
Who is it?

657
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,404
What is it?

658
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:25,361
- Not letting me in?
- Tell me.

659
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,485
No one's home.

660
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,364
The week's pay.

661
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,400
- Sure, but no one's home.
- I'll leave it with you.

662
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,479
Just a minute and I'll let you in.

663
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:47,325
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

664
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,321
- You came by yourself?
- I'm alone!

665
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,285
I'm alone.

666
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:55,486
You can give this pittance
to your cronies, hear me?

667
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:00,485
Where's the list?

668
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,485
Don't move!

669
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:06,319
Put your hands on the floor.

670
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,317
You put our names
together with your cronies'?

671
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,404
Motherfucker!

672
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,359
We hate those people.

673
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,400
Tell your friends that we'll come
get them in their homes

674
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,525
and we'll shoot them
in the head like you!

675
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,441
- How did you get here?
- On my motorbike.

676
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,407
- Now I'll shoot him.
- Not in here.

677
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,485
Go get your bike.

678
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:32,359
Is anyone here?

679
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,478
Leave now!

680
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:21,478
Don Ciro!

681
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:28,485
What an idiot.

682
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,446
Don Ciro!
Where in hell are you going?

683
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,404
He's nuts.

684
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,405
You're acting like a skittish horse,

685
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,360
where are you running to?

686
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,281
You made me take the steps
four at a time.

687
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,439
What can we do with you?

688
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,485
Why are you running?

689
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,404
A wild horse is what you seem.

690
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,405
When will we talk a little?

691
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,365
Not even answering?

692
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,361
I've got to see
what to do with this guy,

693
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,440
I have to blast him.

694
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,446
What did you give me?
The same money again?

695
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,519
Is this guy an idiot?

696
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:19,405
Or are they making him
be an asshole?

697
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,405
Waiting for me to lose my head?

698
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,485
What can I do?

699
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,365
Let's do a stick-up?

700
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,484
A stick-up.

701
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,365
- What?
- A stick-up.

702
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:42,361
- No way!
- Let's do it!

703
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:46,525
- Stick-up a video games room?
- Our money's run out.

704
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:51,326
- What can this place have?
- Money!

705
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,287
Listen to me for once.

706
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,439
Cut the bullshit!

707
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,446
- A hold-up, no way!
- Listen to me.

708
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,441
Let's play one more Euro and go home.

709
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,519
We're out of money!

710
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,524
They must have about 50 cents.

711
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,359
Do we do it or not?

712
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,524
You get that one and
I'll take these guys down.

713
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,361
- See all the people.
- It'll work!

714
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,320
Something fast.

715
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,320
Are you ready?

716
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:32,483
Yes or no?

717
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,479
This is a hold-up!

718
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,400
On the floor!

719
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,478
Get out of there!

720
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,479
- She's hot!
- She sucks.

721
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,485
What!

722
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,321
- You like her?
- What's not to like!

723
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,326
You like one thing, I like another.

724
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,280
Right now!

725
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:51,484
- The blonde in the side room?
- Yeah.

726
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:55,518
Hillary?

727
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,524
Right away!

728
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,365
I can't even stand still.

729
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,439
I'll let you back in later.

730
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,281
- What's your name?
- Kristal.

731
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:26,327
- What do you want to do?
- Everything.

732
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:30,408
Have you ever stripped a girl?
I'll teach you.

733
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,367
- You're the first.
- You go really slow.

734
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:39,278
- I'm too horny.
- Sure, but you have to go slow.

735
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,405
You have to strip right away.

736
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,399
What do we do?

737
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,517
Want to have sex?

738
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:02,483
Wait!

739
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,404
Such a hurry!

740
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,477
Did I hurt you?

741
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:24,520
- Why not?
- Don't bite, it hurts.

742
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:32,365
Hey, zip up!

743
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,398
Zip up!

744
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:37,520
- Look, I'll call...
- Call who you want.

745
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,284
Zip up!

746
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,523
Come here!

747
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,405
- Now!
- You do it.

748
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,367
- Like this?
- It's not allowed.

749
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,443
Or I'll leave.

750
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,319
Come here, I zipped.

751
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:55,443
I'm gonna hurt you.

752
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,287
No, I'm doing the hurting to you.

753
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,361
- Really?
- What do you think?

754
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,485
Don't do anything to me!

755
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:32,327
Where are the weapons?

756
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:45,286
I'll give you one day
to put them back!

757
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,483
Get the message?

758
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:53,520
- Do I shoot them in the head?
- Let them live a little more.

759
01:20:54,380 --> 01:20:56,325
Get back in the car.

760
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:00,477
Get the message?

761
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,477
Sweet Pea, get up!

762
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:19,283
Don't be scared, I'm here,
we're at war!

763
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,404
Get lost!

764
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,286
Get up!

765
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,404
Enough!

766
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:32,365
Come here, don't worry!

767
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,399
- I'm getting out of here.
- No!

768
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,479
We'll beat these guys!

769
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:39,523
Listen to me!

770
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,479
You're making me waste time,

771
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,286
you said you made a mark,
but where is it?

772
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,280
Oh, what is it?

773
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:15,322
- Remember I made a mark!
- Yeah, but you can't find it!

774
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,445
You're as dumb as they come.

775
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,437
Took you half an hour!

776
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,280
Let's move, I have to shoot,

777
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:40,405
I can't stand not shooting!

778
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:42,477
- Want to shoot?
- Right away!

779
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,326
- Did you load it?
- You'd better shut up.

780
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,365
Sweet Pea, do like I tell you.

781
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:55,317
I don't give a fuck what you think.

782
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,360
We break everyone's balls,
but who've we killed?

783
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,445
Do like I say and get moving!

784
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,403
Move!

785
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,440
Where are we going?

786
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,405
Do I have to beat you up?

787
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,484
Do we have to war with each other?

788
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:16,322
I'm not warring with you,
all we have to do is shoot!

789
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:19,480
- We're going to shoot alone?
- Yeah, just you and me!

790
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,440
- Not thinking about later?
- I don't want to think a thing!

791
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:27,317
Want to take the wrong steps,
we'll never grow that way.

792
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,439
Listening to you, we'll die sooner.

793
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,325
Can I say something?

794
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:38,328
Those kids don't know how to behave,
they're just raising Cain.

795
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:41,287
- Why?
- They didn't give the weapons back.

796
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,517
They don't want to listen.

797
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:45,405
I'll make them listen my way.

798
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:50,280
I'll take these guys and kill them.

799
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:55,320
If you kill two kids,

800
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:58,446
what shits will we look like
in the territory

801
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:01,327
when people find out?

802
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:03,365
Are we joking?

803
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,527
Then the cops come,
we have to lay low for a month

804
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,365
and all the traffic ends.

805
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:18,408
Zio Vittorio, they can't be
lording it around in my area,

806
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:22,368
they've already done so much,
I've warned them more than once.

807
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:24,439
I can't consider them kids anymore.

808
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,399
They have to die, that's final!

809
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:31,368
You're right,
but first let's tell the families.

810
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:33,405
I don't know who they are.

811
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:38,366
Will you take care of it?

812
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,525
I'll handle it!

813
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,483
Toto, is that you?

814
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:18,486
- What happened to Silvana?
- In the storeroom.

815
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,327
How come it's so dark?

816
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,365
Why are you in the dark?

817
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:41,285
It's okay like this.

818
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,360
Your change.

819
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,401
- The bread?
- There wasn't any.

820
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,401
- What'll we eat?
- There's pasta.

821
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:57,287
- Take your change.
- It's for you.

822
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:09,524
Why did you put her
in the storeroom?

823
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,325
She's fine where she is.

824
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,361
She's just an animal!

825
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:28,445
Come here a minute,
I have to talk to you.

826
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,325
Don't come out, it's dangerous.

827
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,485
Come on, no one can see you.

828
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,365
What are you doing, you're going?

829
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,286
Listen to me!

830
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,327
They said I have to leave.

831
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,479
I have to leave my house.

832
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,365
I can't do anything.

833
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,405
I'm not leaving!

834
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:58,365
Come here a minute!

835
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:07,480
Tell those friends of yours,
I'm not leaving!

836
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,399
Tell those nice people!

837
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:15,322
I won't betray my son
and I'm not moving from here!

838
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:19,359
Not coming in for coffee?

839
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,285
Run off, run away!

840
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,477
Hello, accountant.

841
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:03,404
Please come in.

842
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:07,486
Why this sudden call?

843
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,437
You're worrying me.

844
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,325
The designers pay me after 60 days,

845
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,445
I have a little money,

846
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:17,282
but this wasn't the agreement.

847
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:19,405
Money isn't the problem.

848
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,365
What is it then?

849
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:24,360
It seems

850
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:27,445
the problem is in your own house.

851
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,400
In my house?

852
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,445
What problem is it?

853
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,440
One of your associates,

854
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,358
Pasquale Del Prete,

855
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,320
has sold out to the Chinese.

856
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:52,325
We're done.

857
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:57,437
The finishing touches...

858
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:08,325
I never doubted.

859
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:29,325
Everything okay?

860
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:35,446
Remember the first time
I put you to work in the factory?

861
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:37,440
You were just a kid.

862
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,524
Right.

863
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:52,479
- Everything alright?
- Yes.

864
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:19,400
Tell him to go slower, not too fast.

865
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,483
Well done, Giulia.

866
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:36,438
She's good.

867
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,359
In the morning I do Tai Chi.

868
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:10,438
Really?

869
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,518
- It's nice.
- It is good for your health.

870
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:16,405
It is like in China.

871
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:21,322
When you go to the park
in the morning, it is full of people

872
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,360
old people too.

873
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:27,319
All doing Tai Chi.

874
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:28,523
Everyone

875
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:32,327
likes the culture of Tai Chi.

876
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:36,479
It's a tradition of Chinese culture.

877
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:39,399
When will you do egg rolls for me?

878
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,320
Wait up.

879
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:40,446
I spoke to the doctors,
you'll soon be released.

880
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:49,365
Damn you,

881
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,400
you really goofed up.

882
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:57,328
They loved the models,
they've asked for more...

883
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:59,320
You knew everything.

884
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:01,479
That's how I saved your life.

885
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:05,327
Those people don't kid around.

886
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:07,325
Leave me alone.

887
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:11,322
You should thank me,
those guys will kill you.

888
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:13,405
You and I pulled through.

889
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,480
- Find another tailor.
- Why do you say that?

890
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:20,366
- I want to be alone.
- How can I do this without you?

891
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,360
I really don't care.

892
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:26,328
- After all I've done for you.
- What have you done for me?

893
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:29,480
I took you off the streets,
I fed you for years.

894
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:33,280
- You've used me since I was a kid.
- Don't say that!

895
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,526
When you're better,
come see me, I'll give you a raise.

896
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:43,362
Rosa, give me that bike,
I have to go.

897
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,519
No admittance here,

898
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:12,477
that's it.

899
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,485
Want to give up?

900
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,444
Are we meat for the slaughter house?

901
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,279
Let's shoot,
we'll rack up corpses too.

902
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:43,478
Corpses?

903
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:48,277
- I'm not moving without orders.
- What orders?

904
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,445
We don't know how to move.

905
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:54,405
We don't know anything.

906
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:00,287
Do we have to keep taking it?

907
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:02,479
Do we have to wait for orders?

908
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,445
Let's rack up corpses.

909
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:11,362
What are we waiting for,
to be put down one by one?

910
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:17,444
If we don't move, nothing will change

911
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,519
No use feeling depressed.

912
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,445
We all have to be convinced.

913
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,361
But without orders, I'm not moving.

914
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:30,485
This is open war,

915
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:33,279
you mustn't think about anyone.

916
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:36,446
- Who do we kill?
- Let's begin in our area.

917
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,479
From our own stronghold.

918
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:42,444
We don't know who's with us
and who's against us,

919
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,519
who do we make pay?

920
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:48,366
Where do you think
the order to kill came from?

921
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:49,518
Think!

922
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:53,285
Where did it come from?

923
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,321
- From there of course.
- From our own area.

924
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:58,365
She betrayed us.

925
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,485
We don't touch women.

926
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:02,403
Don't yell!

927
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:05,399
What are you saying?

928
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:12,402
Don't take it out on someone
no part of this, but the son.

929
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:16,317
- How do we find him?
- His mother's in our district.

930
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,325
It was her son who killed Gaetano.

931
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:20,405
Let's think what we'll do.

932
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:23,445
We could use the kid.

933
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:26,365
He's the only one who can get to her.

934
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,400
He brings her shopping,

935
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,525
he's in good with the woman...

936
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:34,439
So, if we have to do it

937
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,485
we'll need his help.

938
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:41,319
Toto, what do you think you'll do?

939
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:44,485
Are you with us or against us?

940
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:53,285
What do you say?

941
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,439
Are you with us or not?

942
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:01,286
- We'll see what we can do.
- No, "we'll see".

943
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,405
Either you're with us
or you're against us,

944
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,325
one or the other.

945
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:10,328
If you're against us you can't leave,
we can't trust you.

946
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:12,479
It can't have been her.

947
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:15,365
This is our decision,

948
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:17,405
you have to be with us.

949
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,480
That's what we say,
you don't need to think.

950
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:27,365
What are you going to do?

951
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:31,446
- We'll see.
- I said no "we'll see".

952
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:48,398
Come on down.

953
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,445
I have to tell you something!

954
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,285
No, come down!

955
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:57,445
Hurry, I have to leave!

956
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:35,478
Sit down!

957
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:14,365
You've known me for years,

958
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,485
you know what I've always done.

959
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,285
I brought the money.

960
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,405
I brought it to your family too.

961
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:26,405
I did it because I was ordered to.

962
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:33,359
War isn't for me.

963
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:36,361
But you're in it, know that?

964
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:39,444
Yes.

965
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,326
So?

966
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,320
You tell me.

967
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:45,280
What can I tell you?

968
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:51,327
What did you come here for?

969
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,477
To talk to you.

970
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,483
About what?

971
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:02,325
I want to save myself.

972
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:04,479
You'll have to buy your life,

973
01:43:05,340 --> 01:43:07,285
I won't give it to you.

974
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,445
What I did there,

975
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:16,439
I can do for you here.

976
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:19,365
We don't need money-carriers,

977
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:22,480
we have to score,
kill people, and we need money.

978
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,400
You're wasting your time.

979
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,400
You're more dead than alive.

980
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:33,367
But we were brothers before.

981
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:34,438
Before!

982
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:37,441
Then they started
messing around with shit.

983
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:44,405
Our relatives were good people...

984
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,405
so they killed them!

985
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,483
So, don't come asking

986
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:52,477
to pass to the other side.

987
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:55,365
We have to score, kill,

988
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:57,405
and we need money.

989
01:43:58,340 --> 01:43:59,477
If not, you die,

990
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:02,319
because you're part of the war.

991
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:04,359
You bring money and I kill people,

992
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:07,321
we're the same, you and me,
in this war.

993
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,439
- I understand.
- You understand.

994
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:22,477
Wait a moment.

995
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:54,440
Everything okay?

996
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:58,405
And you?

997
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:07,325
That's four.

998
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,445
Face on the table!

999
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,483
Done?

1000
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:23,484
Let's go!

1001
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,280
Come on out!

1002
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,445
Lucky, eh?

1003
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:00,365
That's poison.

1004
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:03,519
What'd he say?

1005
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:07,446
My father wants to say the dumping
you're doing on our land

1006
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:09,437
isn't garbage.

1007
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,437
It's poison.

1008
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:13,485
It's not garbage?

1009
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:16,523
You heard right.

1010
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,477
Don't worry.

1011
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:22,366
A year's gone by with this dumping?

1012
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:26,401
So far,
all we've done is pay our debts.

1013
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,524
Just barely.

1014
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:32,480
- Euro.
- I understand, Don Raffaele.

1015
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:37,484
Everything costs double in Euro.

1016
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,478
And so?

1017
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:42,517
We need something more.

1018
01:47:44,420 --> 01:47:47,321
These are the prices,
explain it to your kids,

1019
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:50,366
if I do it for you,
I have to do it for everyone.

1020
01:47:50,460 --> 01:47:52,405
Don't put me
in a difficult situation.

1021
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,368
Okay, if you give us more,
everyone has to get more.

1022
01:47:56,420 --> 01:47:58,365
So, little can be done.

1023
01:47:58,460 --> 01:48:00,519
But, we barely make ends meet,

1024
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:03,365
we can't go on like this.

1025
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:05,405
We were thinking,

1026
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:09,446
is it possible to do more dumping?

1027
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,320
Euro...

1028
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,479
More dumping?

1029
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:19,286
We have another piece of land
for other dumping sites.

1030
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,517
Near here?

1031
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:23,325
Around here.

1032
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:25,325
More dumping we do,

1033
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,439
faster the ground gets filled.

1034
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:30,327
You have another piece of land?

1035
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,479
- Near here?
- Further on.

1036
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:37,320
This other land
would be more convenient,

1037
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:40,360
it's bigger and trucks
can get in easier.

1038
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,286
But...

1039
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,279
Still 100 Euros per dumping.

1040
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:49,325
What do you mean 100 Euros!

1041
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:51,405
Don't speak out of turn.

1042
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:53,439
- He can't increase!
- Who said so?

1043
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:56,319
We'll increase the trucks.

1044
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:00,446
You have to increase
the price of each dumping.

1045
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,365
Want to lose everything?

1046
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:05,485
They have nowhere else to turn.

1047
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:07,324
Excuse me.

1048
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:09,285
Don't worry.

1049
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:12,485
Alright, now we'll reach...

1050
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:19,320
an agreement.

1051
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:21,445
Give him a glass of water.

1052
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,519
I'll do it, don't worry.

1053
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,364
Luca!

1054
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:43,485
You have to clean up this field!

1055
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:46,280
I'm not Luca.

1056
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,365
Do a little work.

1057
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:50,360
My name's Roberto.

1058
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,485
This field is such a mess.

1059
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:57,325
All such a mess.

1060
01:49:58,380 --> 01:49:59,517
Ma'am, it's raining.

1061
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:02,403
Should I stop?

1062
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:04,440
Come out of there.

1063
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:09,285
I'll take you inside.

1064
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:11,405
I'll be right along.

1065
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:13,485
They've made ditches here,

1066
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:16,319
someone should come

1067
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:18,365
to fill them.

1068
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:32,404
Let's go!

1069
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:46,360
What beautiful peaches, thank you!

1070
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:48,405
I'll take them to the kids.

1071
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:50,485
See how beautiful they are!

1072
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:53,360
Let's go.

1073
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:55,485
Put them in the car.

1074
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:57,326
Come on!

1075
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:12,325
Toss that stuff.

1076
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:14,445
- What?
- The peaches.

1077
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:16,519
Can't you smell how they stink?

1078
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:38,517
Done?

1079
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:56,524
What?

1080
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:58,364
Listen,

1081
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:01,325
I've been thinking.

1082
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:04,439
Maybe I'm not cut out for this work.

1083
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:06,360
What?

1084
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:08,325
I mean it.

1085
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:11,405
I'm not up to it.

1086
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,525
We're doing so well!

1087
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:16,324
No,

1088
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:18,523
I don't want to work anymore,

1089
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:20,398
I'm sorry.

1090
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,319
Think this job sucks?

1091
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:33,402
You know that guys like me
put this shit country in Europe?

1092
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:36,486
Know how many workers I've helped
by saving their companies money?

1093
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:38,443
Stop and look!

1094
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:41,440
What do you see?

1095
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:44,478
Debts.

1096
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:48,286
All these people have been saved
only thanks to us.

1097
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:52,359
I saw how you help them live.

1098
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:55,446
You save a worker in Mestre
and kill a family in Mondragone.

1099
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:58,361
That's how it works,
but I didn't decide it.

1100
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,439
We solve problems created by others.

1101
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:04,399
I didn't create
chromium and asbestos,

1102
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:06,439
I didn't dig up the mountain.

1103
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:08,523
That's how it works?

1104
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:11,325
I don't work that way.

1105
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:13,483
I'm not like you.

1106
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:16,444
- What are you like?
- I'm different.

1107
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,405
Go make pizzas!

1108
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:24,405
He's different.

1109
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:29,399
Don't think you're better than me!

1110
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:32,439
I gave you a chance!

1111
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:36,443
Go fuck yourself!

1112
01:54:34,420 --> 01:54:37,480
I think Scarlett Johansson's here!

1113
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:40,325
Splendid, magnificent,

1114
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,445
all dressed in white,

1115
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:46,518
cream.

1116
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:49,359
In style with the film.

1117
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:53,486
Right colors,
right choice of dress.

1118
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:58,480
It would be nice to know
why it took so long to get ready...

1119
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:02,483
Because it's chic

1120
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:06,285
yet so sophisticated.

1121
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:10,407
An apparent simplicity,
but in reality, very elaborate...

1122
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:12,400
Allow me to say...

1123
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:16,402
Maybe to be awaited as a true star.

1124
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:18,439
She's a star, and so beautiful.

1125
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,525
The photographers are going crazy.

1126
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:26,440
And the people too...

1127
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:33,519
May I sit at your table?

1128
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:42,327
- Can I offer you a cigarette?
- We don't smoke.

1129
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:46,365
Everyone here talks about you.

1130
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:49,484
You kids have balls, I can use you.

1131
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:53,479
Why don't you join my guys?

1132
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,445
You'll have money, motorbikes,

1133
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:58,485
anything you want.

1134
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:01,319
I already saved you once,

1135
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:03,405
because here
they don't like you guys.

1136
01:57:04,340 --> 01:57:06,365
You're causing too much trouble.

1137
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:09,319
It's wise to be with me,

1138
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:11,325
that way you don't have to worry,
you're covered.

1139
01:57:12,460 --> 01:57:14,439
We want to stay alone,

1140
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:17,282
we don't want to be under anyone.

1141
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:19,485
We don't like to be under people.

1142
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:22,405
We're just for us, that's all.

1143
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:26,485
May I confide in you?

1144
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:29,479
It's obvious you're courageous.

1145
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:32,365
You're not talking to cops.

1146
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:34,484
What is it?

1147
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:39,288
I have a good job for you
and you'll earn a barrel of money.

1148
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:41,484
- Money?
- Money's the first thing.

1149
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:43,403
We know.

1150
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:48,480
- May I come closer?
- Sure.

1151
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:51,441
It's something not to be overheard,
just between us.

1152
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:54,439
I need a big favor,

1153
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,485
you could do a "job" for me.

1154
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:59,365
I see you've got balls,

1155
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:03,362
but this guy's a hot one, he's big.

1156
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:06,479
We really like these things.

1157
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:08,443
I'm crazy for them.

1158
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:11,399
You have to kill Peppe the Horseman.

1159
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:14,321
He's a traitor, he took my woman.

1160
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:18,517
You have to shoot him in the balls

1161
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:21,285
and then in the mouth.

1162
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:23,445
I go crazy for these things.

1163
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:26,359
But you have to do me a favor.

1164
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:31,448
They told me you
stole some weapons from around here.

1165
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:35,524
You have to give them back,
we gotta make them disappear.

1166
01:58:36,340 --> 01:58:38,444
- I'll give you the weapons.
- You will?

1167
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:41,441
Weapons, motorbikes,
anything you want.

1168
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:43,485
Let's talk about the money.

1169
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:47,286
Tell me what you want
for this job.

1170
01:58:47,460 --> 01:58:49,405
A really good amount.

1171
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:52,282
Is 10,000 Euro enough?

1172
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:55,444
Yes.

1173
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:58,441
I'll give you an advance,
the rest when the job's done.

1174
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,400
Put it in your pocket.

1175
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:14,327
- Is it right?
- Fine.

1176
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:44,400
- Not there.
- Then where?

1177
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:48,440
- Where the fuck do we go?
- Who knows where he went!

1178
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:53,444
- We lost him.
- Are you sure?

1179
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:58,441
- Look over there.
- There's nothing.

1180
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:02,360
Then where?

1181
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:04,523
There he is!

1182
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:52,280
Get off.

1183
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:07,478
Come on!

1184
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:12,407
For two kids such a waste of time.

1185
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:14,400
Guys, it had to be done.

1186
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:16,400
Everything's okay.

1187
02:06:02,500 --> 02:06:05,526
In Europe the Camorra has killed more
than all other criminal organizations

1188
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:09,360
4,000 deaths in the last thirty years
One every three days.

1189
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:13,317
Scampia is the biggest
drug-pushing locality in the world.

1190
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:16,400
Daily sales per clan
run about 500,000 Euro.

1191
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:20,366
If clan-managed waste were piled
it would reach 14,600 meters.

1192
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:22,405
Everest is 8,850 meters.

1193
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:25,401
There is a 20% increase in cancer
in the poisoned areas.

1194
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:30,367
Gains from illegal activities are
reinvested in legal ones worldwide.

1195
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:34,408
The Camorra has also invested in the
reconstruction of the Twin Towers.
