1
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,390
How long you gonna be?.

2
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,483
Be right out,

3
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,486
you're a pain!

4
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,388
Hey, American.

5
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,432
I'm still here, gettin' a manicure.

6
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,478
Things okay?.

7
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,439
Gettin' tanned?. Don't get burned!

8
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,317
Bruno's here too.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,402
You got a crap body!

10
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,531
Is Bruno here?.

11
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,449
He's over there.

12
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,458
You doin' a lamp?.

13
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,401
It's 2,000.

14
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,362
How much are you
supposed to get this week?.

15
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,530
9,200.

16
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,326
Sure?. It was less last week.

17
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,370
Yes, Don Ciro 9,200.

18
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,374
Another 2,000 euro and we're even.

19
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,336
Don Ciro, don't take all day.

20
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,296
He's slow.

21
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,424
Hurry, so we can go home.

22
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,345
Things okay out there?.

23
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,554
Keep your eyes open.

24
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,483
That's it.

25
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,448
Put paper cups in.

26
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,538
Toilet paper.

27
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,297
- Then, Mom?.
- Some shampoo.

28
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,509
A mozzarella...

29
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,391
Shampoo, not bath oil!

30
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,352
You're rushin' me!

31
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,437
And you're drivin' me crazy!

32
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,320
Hurry up, there are
more groceries to deliver.

33
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,322
- Nothing else?.
- No.

34
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,454
- Be back later.
- Don't get yourself lost.

35
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,551
- Simone.
- Toto, what's up?.

36
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,346
- What's happening?.
- I'm workin'.

37
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,517
Know what happened?.
They arrested Vitale and Bon Bon.

38
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,394
Really?.

39
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,480
- Got somethin' to eat?.
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

40
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,441
Bye, see you.

41
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,375
Carmela, ma'am!

42
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,549
Hi, Boxer.

43
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,370
Two doses, two doses!

44
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,373
Please, give me a dose!

45
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,338
Gaetano, check it!

46
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,331
One, two, three...

47
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,503
Goodbye.

48
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,507
Don Ciro, be more punctual.

49
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,343
I'll pass it on.

50
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,436
Eleven and twelve.

51
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,355
See if he wants coffee.

52
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,441
No, but thank you anyway....

53
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,401
I'll show you out.

54
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,361
Have a good day.

55
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,371
Four hundred...

56
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,543
Five hundred.

57
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,421
The same amount again?.

58
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:28,425
I've said a hundred times
I can't manage like this.

59
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,427
Don Carlo...

60
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,309
Did you tell them I can't manage
on this chickenfeed?.

61
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,354
I have to pay rent, lights, water.

62
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,316
I can't survive,
I'm strapped with debts.

63
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,444
- I'll pass it on.
- You always say that!

64
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,322
Are you mockin' me?.

65
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,533
I don't get it!

66
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,535
Listen,

67
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,412
I've got a son to support,

68
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,457
for forty years
I've kept him off the streets,

69
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,418
he's unemployed.

70
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,463
What can I do,
go over to the other side?.

71
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,385
They know, I served you honestly
for forty years.

72
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,471
My wife's in jail,
is this the thanks we get?.

73
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,308
Are we crazy?.
Do I have to raise hell?.

74
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,479
Silvana!

75
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,322
May I?.

76
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,576
Come on in!

77
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,411
Maria!

78
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,331
The bill?.

79
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,458
Talk to Mom.

80
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,383
Put this in your pocket.

81
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,385
Thank you.

82
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,400
Carabinieri on the street!

83
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,495
He's comin' out!

84
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,350
I'm the best, number one!

85
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,518
So?.

86
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,436
Go, Marco!

87
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,524
- I'll blast these roaches!
- Who do you think you're fighting?.

88
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,319
I'm number one! Tony Montana!

89
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,446
The world is ours!

90
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,407
You don't know
who you're up against!

91
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,451
I'm Tony Montana!

92
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,371
- I'm the powerhouse!
- Yeah!

93
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:03,497
Come here.

94
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,376
Shit Colombians,

95
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,378
they're everywhere.

96
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,339
See, Colombians everywhere.

97
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,345
You really looked like Scarface.

98
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,357
You were good.

99
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,568
Now it all has to be ours,
the whole world.

100
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,404
Miami, all of it.

101
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,503
My friend, got stuff?.

102
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,556
You got stuff?.

103
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,439
- Got good stuff?.
- You got money?.

104
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,359
- Sure, you got coke?.
- What do you want to pay?.

105
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,486
Me?. 50.

106
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,533
- 55, can you do it?.
- No, 55 is too much, 50.

107
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,536
You sure?.

108
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,372
Wait here for me.

109
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,591
Where's Smarty?.

110
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,485
Hey, kid!

111
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,333
Give him the money.

112
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,424
- Is it all here?.
- Yeah.

113
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,359
- Okay?.
- Yes.

114
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,448
- Want to see it?.
- I want to try it.

115
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,577
I gave you the money!

116
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,495
Wait!

117
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,502
Open your hand.

118
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,424
It's good.

119
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,595
Give me all of it!

120
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,355
Grab the money!

121
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:24,424
Giovanni, I brought the kids.

122
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,551
Come in.

123
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,557
You know very well why you're here.

124
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:35,561
Too much ruckus going on in my area,
because I'm the boss here.

125
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,604
That's just you sayin'.

126
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,567
If I had you come here, I know.
No back-talk

127
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,528
or I'll smash your face!

128
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,574
- What happened?.
- For the moment, nothing.

129
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,576
Get me?.

130
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,455
I can't be made to look bad
because of two kids like you.

131
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,542
The next time
I hear anything about you,

132
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,544
I'll blow your heads off.

133
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,381
- If it's like you say...
- Shut up when I'm talking.

134
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,508
Then if I come to realize

135
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,511
you're worth something,

136
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,389
which I'll determine and I'll decide,

137
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,350
you can work for me.

138
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,519
Is that clear?.

139
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,397
Show them out.

140
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,405
"I'll smash your face!"

141
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,532
And I'll tear your beard!

142
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,368
Without a T-shirt.

143
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,496
"Sweet Pea", looked like a bum.

144
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,539
A real bum.

145
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,543
He is a bum! Did you see
who he sent to get us?.

146
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,505
If that guy's the boss here,

147
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,548
then here we can be the bosses.

148
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,470
If a guy like him is boss here,
this area is ours!

149
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,389
I'll live for 30 years
if he's boss here.

150
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,393
Sure, because he's a retard!

151
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,481
Get it?. I'll live for 30 years.

152
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,359
But he could at least shave!

153
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,527
Shave!

154
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,446
"I'll smash your face!"

155
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,533
Let's go have a snort to spite him.

156
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,411
We've got everything,
we can do like we want.

157
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,417
Anyway, he's a fat shit-ass.

158
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,461
He bugged you?.

159
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,547
He showers once a week!

160
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,511
"I'll blow your heads off! "

161
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,619
Roberto!

162
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,423
Let's go, it's too small.

163
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:13,427
- But the methane one's big.
- No, it's small.

164
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:17,556
- Can I finish measuring?.
- No, we're wasting time.

165
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,438
- I have to take some shots.
- What a bore with these pictures!

166
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,398
Let's go!

167
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,447
Just look at this.

168
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,408
It's disgusting down there.

169
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,543
Here is perfect.

170
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,379
It's perfect.

171
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,591
We're near the highway,
the trucks can get really close,

172
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,386
they dump the earth
and cover all the water.

173
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,554
Perfect.

174
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,600
Franco, it's 85 meters.

175
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,353
Get the length too.

176
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,398
Come here.

177
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,402
Dante.

178
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,488
Hello, everything okay?.

179
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:18,575
This is Roberto.

180
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,581
- It's time we made room for youth.
- We need new energy.

181
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,583
Take a few more shots.

182
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,462
Did you hear?.

183
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,548
They bombed me,

184
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,508
at the cement plant.

185
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,594
A whole wall came down,

186
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,471
slowly.

187
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,515
Be careful.

188
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,517
Zio resolved it.

189
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,396
I'd forgotten to pay
for some land I'd bought.

190
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:50,440
- An injunction against payment?.
- Yeah!

191
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,609
- What do you think?.
- It's fine.

192
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:57,447
- Can we fill this quarry?.
- Sure can.

193
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,491
Tell Zio it's fine.

194
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:03,537
Remember, everything clean:
terracing, solid stuff...

195
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,541
Or the redevelopment agency
will break our balls.

196
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,587
Don't worry,
you emptied it and I'll fill it.

197
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:24,516
All the pieces have to be cut
and the sizes worked out.

198
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,478
They want 120 of these.

199
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,534
Six and seven are identical.

200
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:48,540
Here the satin is cut on the bias.

201
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,542
It's all hand-hemmed.

202
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,503
Is it tough?.

203
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,547
The models aren't hard,
I can do it.

204
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,636
Eight hundred items in two months,
is our request.

205
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,389
Keep in mind
we start at 50 euros per item.

206
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,519
You've seen the models,
the price is good,

207
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:11,438
estimate and make your offers.

208
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,608
Thirty euro, 30 days?.

209
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,402
Don't go any lower.

210
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,530
This is high fashion,
it's not pret-a-porter.

211
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,532
Forty-five, in two months.

212
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,536
- Ms. Zamarion!
- Yes?.

213
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,621
Thirty-eight, forty.

214
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,457
That's a very interesting proposal.

215
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,459
Thirty-five, thirty-five,

216
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,504
excellent workmanship
and delivery times respected.

217
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,549
Thirty, thirty!

218
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,558
Please,

219
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,394
we're not imposing anything!

220
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,480
Did we say thirty, thirty?.

221
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:56,483
At this point

222
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,485
twenty-eight, thirty!

223
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,449
Thirty, twenty-five!

224
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,495
I can't lose this bid.

225
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,623
Come here, there's some bubbly!

226
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,420
Are they coming?.

227
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,630
- I don't think so.
- Why not?.

228
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,386
Five days less for delivery,

229
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,389
we'll have to work overtime,
and I'll do nights...

230
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,474
What's odd about that?.

231
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:31,518
They're talking overtime pay.

232
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,562
They'll get it!

233
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,565
Am I scared of a little overtime?.

234
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,444
Like the last time?.

235
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,529
Don't worry,
this time it's a sure thing.

236
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:48,494
- They've lost their trust.
- I know.

237
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:52,498
- I asked you to talk to them.
- You do it, please.

238
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,542
You're on closer terms,
they respect you.

239
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,504
Do me this favor.

240
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,590
Don't say no, go talk to them.

241
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,551
You know I'm fond of you,

242
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,595
I'll have to make
a gold statue to you!

243
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:09,431
I'll go down and see the accountant
for the money.

244
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:17,439
Sorry, how much is this?.

245
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,525
Ten thousand.

246
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,529
It's not enough, I need more.

247
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,572
Twice that at least.

248
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,450
Mr. Enzo,
you're already "complicated".

249
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,536
Yes, but for personal affairs.

250
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,455
I need this for work.

251
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,541
I'll give it back in three months.

252
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:38,418
But this isn't enough.

253
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,587
If you don't need it
and it's not enough,

254
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:42,589
I'll take it back.

255
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:44,550
It's best for you.

256
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,469
Don't be like that, listen,

257
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,596
I need at least double!

258
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,391
It's no risk,

259
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,600
you'll earn from it, right?.

260
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,519
What can I say?.

261
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,438
I'll pass it on,
can you make-do for now?.

262
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:00,524
Yes, I'll take it.

263
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,453
Congratulations, Mr. Pasquale.

264
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:14,580
Thank you.

265
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:16,582
We met yesterday.

266
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,544
I need your help.

267
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,595
I am having trouble with work.

268
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,558
I have to get into
haute couture right away,

269
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,478
but for me

270
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,440
it is very difficult.

271
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,525
I need help.

272
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:48,572
You are

273
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,450
a great master,

274
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,619
you are very important for me.

275
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,413
You teach ten lessons

276
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,416
to workers in my factory.

277
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,586
I pay you in cash,

278
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,589
2,000 euros a lesson

279
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,634
for ten lessons.

280
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,638
We work together,
but no one knows it,

281
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,557
just the two of us.

282
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:19,436
I need your help.

283
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,439
Think it over.

284
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,488
- What's the cloth like?.
- Come and see.

285
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,565
I've got nothin'!

286
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:06,608
Don't move!

287
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,549
They must have gone over to his side,

288
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,470
or they'd have arrested
me first and then those other guys.

289
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:19,598
Believe me?. All of them were there
when I called you.

290
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,476
I said: Check out this car,
it's suspect.

291
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:24,478
This stuff here is ours.

292
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,480
My gun!

293
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,401
Check this stuff out,
there should be fifty-six.

294
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,531
Good, Toto, this is for you.

295
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,662
How can I get working with you?.

296
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,456
We'll let you know.

297
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,627
- Did you turn off the water?.
- Of course!

298
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:51,630
- Can I help out?.
- No, you'll get wet.

299
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:53,590
Doesn't matter!

300
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:56,426
Come and see.

301
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,470
Careful not to slip.

302
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:03,475
- Is it coming from the well?.
- No, I think it's from the pipe.

303
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,478
Careful, water's coming in.

304
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,399
See if you can close it.

305
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,526
It's closed,
but it's the pipe that...

306
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,659
I'd give you a hand, but...

307
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:23,620
What a great day!

308
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:26,456
Push it all in one direction.

309
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:35,424
I thought I'd be having coffee!

310
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,594
- Nice coffee, huh?.
- I'll have some next time.

311
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,478
Totore, things okay?.

312
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,566
- Can I say hi?.
- No, you gotta leave.

313
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,402
Go down with these bags!

314
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,447
You have to move!

315
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,533
Ma'am, go around the other way.

316
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:04,536
- What's going on?.
- Everything's fine, leave.

317
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:25,641
Lucia?.

318
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:57,589
Come closer.

319
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,426
- What's your name?.
- Luigi.

320
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:05,472
- Are you scared?.
- No.

321
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:07,641
- Sure?.
- No.

322
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,601
We'll see.

323
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,605
- Are you strong?.
- Yeah!

324
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,608
Let's see how strong you are.

325
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,489
Why are you shaking?.

326
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:25,409
No?.

327
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,533
- See how strong this kid is.
- Come closer!

328
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:39,501
- Are you scared?.
- Yes.

329
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,478
Now you're a man.

330
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,624
Nothin'! Everything's okay!

331
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:23,504
When I did my piercing,
I got an infection.

332
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,464
Let's see.

333
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,467
You went and did it there?.

334
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:32,513
- I'd like to have it on my eyebrow.
- Stinks.

335
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,598
It's nicer there, you're right.

336
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,644
It's gonna rain.

337
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:45,609
Everything's okay!

338
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,694
A car's coming!

339
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,532
It went in!

340
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:55,577
It's going in!

341
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,497
Check out this other one!

342
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,543
Everything's okay!

343
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:36,618
Sorry I'm late, the Councilman,
City Hall, the traffic...

344
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:39,621
- My father.
- How do you do.

345
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:46,503
I'm glad he's with you
you're a good person.

346
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,589
He's in your care.

347
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,591
He's a clever guy.

348
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,635
I don't doubt that but...

349
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,555
- Having work is important to him.
- Of course.

350
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,516
I tried so hard
to find him work in Naples...

351
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,644
- Where do you work?.
- In the hospital, intensive care.

352
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:05,522
A bad division.

353
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:10,652
I tried to get him in,
but I have no connections.

354
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,489
He's all set now.

355
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,492
You did something no one else did.

356
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:18,660
I thank you, you raised him well.

357
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:20,662
Have you always worked in Naples?.

358
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:23,540
No, also in Trieste, Udine,

359
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,543
- Venice...
- That's where we're going.

360
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:29,588
I told him about Venice.

361
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:33,675
He's excited, it's his first time.

362
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,638
Dad, we have a plane.

363
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,474
Did you bring some things?.

364
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,643
What's that, your gym bag?.

365
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:46,522
- Goodbye.
- He's in your care.

366
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,503
- What do you pay for disposal?.
- Today I'm paying 50.

367
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:10,712
Your offer?.

368
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:13,507
We can halve your costs,

369
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,509
25 cents a kilo.

370
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,511
That's good,

371
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,555
but is it all "clean",
like they say in the United States?.

372
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,598
Since it's toxic waste,

373
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:24,476
certification,
storage and transportation.

374
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:29,606
- Is there a contract to look over?.
- Of course.

375
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,529
In case you're wondering,

376
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,614
the disposal cycle

377
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,492
goes to the disposal area
in Marcianise.

378
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:42,494
I'm telling you in fairness.

379
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,663
Thank you for the information,

380
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,708
but my only concern
is that it's "clean".

381
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,544
You can rest assured of that.

382
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,629
We can dispose of all the waste

383
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,715
that you produce in a year.

384
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:56,633
Eight hundred tons.

385
00:36:58,468 --> 00:36:59,511
It's not a problem.

386
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:00,721
That's a lot.

387
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,685
My concern is disposal.

388
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,646
We serve various companies,
you can check.

389
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,608
I already have!

390
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,527
Don't worry.

391
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:19,573
As far as I can see,
there's maximum transparency.

392
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,450
Absolutely.

393
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:26,663
- The warehouses at Teverola?.
- We use them for tires.

394
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:28,540
Exactly.

395
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,627
Will we put the tannery waste
in the quarry?.

396
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,463
- Don't talk foolishness.
- Where then?.

397
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,590
Check the European catalogue.

398
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:40,552
Here they are, 04.

399
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,639
The ones in red,
are among the most dangerous.

400
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:47,643
"Exhausted degreasing baths
with solvents, no liquid phase."

401
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:49,686
No, no good.

402
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:53,607
Then 4-11:

403
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,568
"Waste containing halogenated
compounds from operations

404
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,570
of manufacturing and finishing."

405
00:37:58,654 --> 00:38:00,572
These are good.

406
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:04,451
It's stuff the earth absorbs,
we'll mix it with compost.

407
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:05,619
Fertilizer!

408
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:11,458
All that leaves is
Milan's sweeping refuse,

409
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,460
that's 60 trucks.

410
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:17,464
- The quarries at San Felice?.
- They're too small.

411
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:19,508
I don't think so, look.

412
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,593
Let me see.

413
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,643
They're too small
and they're shallow,

414
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,604
they're no good.

415
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:47,494
Yes... I've got
ten contracts out of ten.

416
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:52,624
Is he near you?.

417
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,587
Put him on.

418
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:58,630
I'll talk to him.

419
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,530
I told him, everything's okay.

420
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:39,505
- Do you like traveling?.
- Sure!

421
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:41,673
We'll take more trips.

422
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,684
Everyone here works in boats?.

423
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,522
Everyone, firemen, ambulances...

424
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,692
- Funerals.
- I've already seen two.

425
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:03,529
Even the dead go by boat!

426
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,678
Wow, they've got so many!

427
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:34,560
Steady me.

428
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,570
There's nothing here.

429
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,628
Nothing?.

430
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:44,588
Are you sure?.

431
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,573
Oh God!

432
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:13,575
Look what's here!

433
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:22,668
See?. It's like you said!

434
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:27,548
Look here!

435
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,550
A Beretta 93!

436
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,510
A Kalashnikov!

437
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:33,679
See if they're loaded.

438
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,682
- Check.
- It's unloaded.

439
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:53,532
Look, an M12!

440
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,701
This is the 921.

441
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:57,619
That bearded bum!

442
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:59,746
We'll see how
he blows my head off!

443
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,750
Enough for Casale di Principe!
Everybody!

444
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,588
Won't blow my head off now, eh?.

445
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,677
Should I put two in?.

446
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:17,556
And Nikita's?.

447
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,558
And the 38?.

448
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:38,702
- Want to see how I can shoot?.
- Show me!

449
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,580
Show me!

450
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,583
Aim there!

451
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:20,577
I hit it!

452
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,637
We'll blow
the Colombians' heads off!

453
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,564
That's good.

454
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,611
Everything okay?.

455
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,577
With love and feeling.

456
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:16,717
- What is it?.
- Your wife's on the phone.

457
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,760
Tell her not to wait up.

458
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,680
Don't get tired out, need anything?.

459
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:23,682
No, thanks.

460
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:25,726
- You'll lock up?.
- Yes.

461
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:27,644
Goodnight.

462
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,586
Xian?.

463
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:27,704
I have been waiting for you.

464
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:32,751
- I got lost.
- I am happy you came.

465
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:47,641
Please sit down.

466
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,688
We are cooking fish.

467
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:04,533
I've already eaten.

468
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:07,619
Try a typical Chinese dish.

469
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:09,663
Okay?.

470
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,589
Just cooked, it is good.

471
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,549
Meat with bell peppers.

472
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:22,593
I've already eaten.

473
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:26,722
Taste.

474
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:29,516
We use chopsticks.

475
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,643
- I don't know how to use them.
- Try!

476
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:36,607
I am pleased,

477
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:38,692
we have a little toast.

478
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:42,529
We go to the factory.

479
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:51,622
Why not?.

480
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:57,586
I put a pillow in here.

481
00:47:57,711 --> 00:47:59,588
It's dangerous.

482
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:04,551
I already told you,
no one can know, just us.

483
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,720
It's better for both of us.

484
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:11,600
- Won't I need air?.
- No, there's an opening.

485
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:15,604
I'll open the front window,
so air will come in.

486
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:19,525
Forgive me.

487
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:22,736
Are we sure?.

488
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,741
It is best for both of us,
because it is dangerous.

489
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:33,539
- Does air come through here?.
- Yes.

490
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:35,749
And I'll open the window too.

491
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:40,564
Please come in, Mr. Pasquale.

492
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:43,734
All are waiting for you.

493
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,655
All are very happy.

494
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:05,714
I told them who you are
and all are happy.

495
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,511
What a nice factory!

496
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:12,721
More than 80 people.

497
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,640
I'm moved.

498
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:02,604
What can I say?.

499
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,732
To do this work

500
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:09,528
you need lots of patience...

501
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:16,702
...and lots of love.

502
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,710
For the first lesson...

503
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:29,673
...I'll cut out a bodice.

504
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:38,724
Let's begin.

505
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:52,571
You must place patterns carefully.

506
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,746
Spread the cloth well...

507
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:25,604
Maria, are you asleep?.

508
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:32,694
Where have I been, in China?.

509
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,658
They were all bowing to me.

510
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:41,578
Master!

511
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:44,581
They called me "master"!

512
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,589
- Did you know the Chinese can cook?.
- The Chinese?.

513
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,675
Darn right!

514
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,594
They cooked a delicious bass!

515
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:02,766
There were boxes everywhere

516
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,561
and they put me in the trunk!

517
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,689
Both coming and going.

518
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:13,777
I need some sleep.

519
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:18,657
Here.

520
00:53:19,575 --> 00:53:21,618
I have to sleep a few hours.

521
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:27,666
What's this money?.

522
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:40,637
Where did you get it?.

523
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,723
I have to sleep.

524
00:53:45,684 --> 00:53:47,561
Help me understand.

525
00:53:47,686 --> 00:53:49,688
I talked to my son this morning,

526
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:52,608
he said: "Mom I'm leaving,

527
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:54,735
I'm going to be a secessionist."

528
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:57,613
Really?.

529
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,577
What did you say?.

530
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:05,662
He's convinced,

531
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,665
he said: "We're great,

532
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:12,669
we'll win the war,
the others are nobodies".

533
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:15,756
War?. A bunch of morons
warring against us?.

534
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:18,634
You have to stop him.

535
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,720
This side is the right side.

536
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,682
Have you seen what's happening?.

537
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:27,768
There are killings every day.

538
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:32,606
Don't say anything to anybody,
not even your husband.

539
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,692
Who'd ever tell him!

540
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:40,739
When he gets out, what'll he do?.
Father and son will kill each other?.

541
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:43,617
No, because your son
will stay right here.

542
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,746
They'll all come to a bad end.

543
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:54,628
Do you feel so sure about that?.

544
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,796
I don't.

545
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:58,632
I do.

546
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:51,560
When will we see each other again?.

547
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,562
When you change sides.

548
00:55:53,645 --> 00:55:55,689
Want to stay faithful?. Go ahead!

549
00:55:56,607 --> 00:55:58,650
You go your way and I go another.

550
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:02,613
But we can still have
a pizza together with friends.

551
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:04,573
I'm telling you again,

552
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:06,575
friend, enemy.

553
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,539
We've known each other for so long,
why go with them?.

554
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:15,667
Remember when we were brothers?.
Now we're enemies.

555
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:21,632
I'm telling you, if you don't
change sides, we might kill you

556
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:23,675
or you might kill us.

557
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,720
Because we're at war,

558
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:29,640
people are dying every day.

559
00:56:34,812 --> 00:56:37,731
- You could have stayed with us...
- What for?.

560
00:56:37,815 --> 00:56:39,775
I'm best on the other side.

561
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:53,664
Bye, Simone.

562
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,647
Want a little Sambuca?.

563
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:07,738
You'll be right off, don't worry.

564
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:09,698
Takes time.

565
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:28,675
Careful when you go out.

566
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:30,594
Thank you.

567
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:00,767
Gaetano, show him.

568
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:03,770
- It's big.
- You're right.

569
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:05,731
- Enzo!
- What?.

570
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:09,568
Do I have to tell you?.

571
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,696
It's awesome.

572
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:14,698
I like it.

573
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,617
Like it?.

574
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:18,619
You look great.

575
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:20,579
Toto, show it off.

576
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:23,707
It's really nice.

577
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:35,802
- How many so far?.
- 45 doses.

578
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:37,721
Okay.

579
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:41,600
It's good stuff.

580
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,615
How many so far?.

581
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,783
Fifty-two,

582
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,661
plus four that guy's still got.

583
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:03,580
- Understand?.
- Yeah.

584
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,713
I'll get back to you later.

585
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:18,595
- How many?.
- Fifty-two and that guy's got four.

586
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,639
Then we'll total it.

587
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,688
Hello!

588
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,816
Nice, eh?.

589
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:33,652
Hi, gorgeous!

590
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:35,612
Girls!

591
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:36,655
Beautiful!

592
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:37,823
Alessia?.

593
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:44,705
What are you doing here?. Get out.

594
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:48,792
I don't want to see you around here.

595
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,630
We have to go crying
at the prison gates?.

596
01:01:53,714 --> 01:01:56,592
What I went through with your father
was enough for me.

597
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:56,753
Good morning, Jacob.

598
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:59,631
- Are you alright?.
- Fine, thank you, and you?.

599
01:04:00,716 --> 01:04:02,676
Have a good trip?.

600
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:04,761
A very nice trip.

601
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:09,683
- Do you have documents?.
- It's humanitarian aid.

602
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:11,727
Yes, it's humanitarian aid.

603
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:14,605
- Everything okay?.
- Yes.

604
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:18,817
They've already called an ambulance.

605
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:23,822
Get back to work!

606
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:31,622
Go back to work!

607
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:33,790
What happened?.

608
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:36,668
As they were dumping,

609
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,630
two drums opened
and spilled on a truck driver.

610
01:04:39,755 --> 01:04:41,840
- Have you already called zio?.
- No!

611
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:45,677
- They wanted to call an ambulance!
- I'll take care of this.

612
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,849
Pay the truckers
and tell them to fuck off.

613
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:55,646
- Who'll drive the trucks?.
- Don't the blacks know how?.

614
01:04:55,813 --> 01:04:57,731
Can you drive?.

615
01:04:57,773 --> 01:05:00,734
They can't even ride bikes!

616
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:04,655
I'll handle this.

617
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:07,699
Don't let them touch the trucks,
they're ours.

618
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:11,662
Roberto, wait here.

619
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:12,746
Calm down!

620
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:23,757
You made a mistake, you had us doing
a job we shouldn't have!

621
01:05:23,841 --> 01:05:25,801
It just happened!

622
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:15,642
- I'm taking the red one.
- No, that's mine!

623
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:24,902
- Take that one.
- I'll take this one!

624
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:32,826
- I'm not tall enough!
- Climb up there!

625
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:40,792
Wake up, get some cushions!

626
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:48,842
- The keys?.
- Look under the seat!

627
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:54,807
Come on! Are you sleeping?.

628
01:06:55,808 --> 01:06:57,810
Can't you see there's work to do?.

629
01:06:57,935 --> 01:06:59,937
Put this under your butt!

630
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:03,774
Put it under your butt.

631
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:05,901
Go slowly
and drive the truck down there.

632
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:08,737
Then I'll pay you.

633
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,868
Catch this cushion.

634
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:19,706
Come on!

635
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:24,753
Go slow!

636
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:29,842
Move forward
and make space for that one!

637
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:33,720
Roberto, tell him what to do!

638
01:07:38,892 --> 01:07:40,769
All the way down there!

639
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,833
- What is it?.
- It's the new list.

640
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,877
Have you already paid
the Mellone family?.

641
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,879
And the redhead's family too?.

642
01:09:31,713 --> 01:09:31,922
Of course.

643
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:33,924
Wasted money.

644
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:37,678
Let's make not make these mistakes
anymore.

645
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:39,805
Are these the only ones?.

646
01:09:40,806 --> 01:09:42,808
More money and less work.

647
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:45,727
But more risk.

648
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:47,771
What risk?.

649
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:50,858
Just don't go into certain areas,

650
01:09:50,941 --> 01:09:53,819
the Seven Buildings, the Smurf Houses
and the Blue Houses.

651
01:09:53,944 --> 01:09:56,780
As for the rest, you can go anywhere.

652
01:09:56,822 --> 01:09:59,700
Maria's not here, I already paid her.

653
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,830
- Isn't her husband with us?.
- Yes, but her son betrayed.

654
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:06,874
They mustn't get a cent.

655
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:12,838
These things are none of your affair,
respect the list.

656
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:33,901
Who is it?.

657
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:46,830
What is it?.

658
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:49,791
- Not letting me in?.
- Tell me.

659
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,919
No one's home.

660
01:10:52,753 --> 01:10:53,795
The week's pay.

661
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:56,840
- Sure, but no one's home.
- I'll leave it with you.

662
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:58,884
Just a minute and I'll let you in.

663
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:11,730
- Are you alone?.
- Yes.

664
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:14,733
- You came by yourself?.
- I'm alone!

665
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:16,693
I'm alone.

666
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,905
You can give this pittance
to your cronies, hear me?.

667
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,910
Where's the list?.

668
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:27,913
Don't move!

669
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:30,749
Put your hands on the floor.

670
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:34,753
You put our names
together with your cronies'?.

671
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:35,838
Motherfucker!

672
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:38,799
We hate those people.

673
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:41,844
Tell your friends that we'll come
get them in their homes

674
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,929
and we'll shoot them
in the head like you!

675
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:48,851
- How did you get here?.
- On my motorbike.

676
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:51,812
- Now I'll shoot him.
- Not in here.

677
01:11:51,937 --> 01:11:53,897
Go get your bike.

678
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,775
Is anyone here?.

679
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:57,901
Leave now!

680
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:45,908
Don Ciro!

681
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:52,915
What an idiot.

682
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:01,882
Don Ciro!
Where in hell are you going?.

683
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:03,842
He's nuts.

684
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:09,848
You're acting like a skittish horse,

685
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:12,810
where are you running to?.

686
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:15,729
You made me take the steps
four at a time.

687
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:17,856
What can we do with you?.

688
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,900
Why are you running?.

689
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:22,820
A wild horse is what you seem.

690
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,824
When will we talk a little?.

691
01:13:28,742 --> 01:13:30,786
Not even answering?.

692
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:33,789
I've got to see
what to do with this guy,

693
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:35,874
I have to blast him.

694
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:38,877
What did you give me?.
The same money again?.

695
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:40,963
Is this guy an idiot?.

696
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:43,841
Or are they making him
be an asshole?.

697
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:47,845
Waiting for me to lose my head?.

698
01:13:48,971 --> 01:13:50,931
What can I do?.

699
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:59,815
Let's do a stick-up?.

700
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:00,899
A stick-up.

701
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,819
- What?.
- A stick-up.

702
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:06,780
- No way!
- Let's do it!

703
01:14:07,781 --> 01:14:10,951
- Stick-up a video games room?.
- Our money's run out.

704
01:14:12,786 --> 01:14:15,747
- What can this place have?.
- Money!

705
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:18,709
Listen to me for once.

706
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:20,878
Cut the bullshit!

707
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,882
- A hold-up, no way!
- Listen to me.

708
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:27,885
Let's play one more euro and go home.

709
01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:29,970
We're out of money!

710
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,975
They must have about 50 cents.

711
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,811
Do we do it or not?.

712
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:40,981
You get that one and
I'll take these guys down.

713
01:14:41,899 --> 01:14:44,818
- See all the people.
- It'll work!

714
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:47,738
Something fast.

715
01:14:52,868 --> 01:14:54,745
Are you ready?.

716
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:56,914
Yes or no?.

717
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,919
This is a hold-up!

718
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,838
On the floor!

719
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:09,927
Get out of there!

720
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,910
- She's hot!
- She sucks.

721
01:16:57,993 --> 01:16:59,953
What!

722
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:03,790
- You like her?.
- What's not to like!

723
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:06,793
You like one thing, I like another.

724
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,716
Right now!

725
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,928
- The blonde in the side room?.
- Yeah.

726
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:19,973
Hillary?.

727
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:31,985
Right away!

728
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:35,823
I can't even stand still.

729
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:37,908
I'll let you back in later.

730
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:45,749
- What's your name?.
- Kristal.

731
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:50,796
- What do you want to do?.
- Everything.

732
01:17:50,963 --> 01:17:54,842
Have you ever stripped a girl?.
I'll teach you.

733
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:57,803
- You're the first.
- You go really slow.

734
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:03,725
- I'm too horny.
- Sure, but you have to go slow.

735
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:09,857
You have to strip right away.

736
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:19,867
What do we do?.

737
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:24,955
Want to have sex?.

738
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:26,957
Wait!

739
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,876
Such a hurry!

740
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:45,934
Did I hurt you?.

741
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:48,979
- Why not?.
- Don't bite, it hurts.

742
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,820
Hey, zip up!

743
01:18:57,779 --> 01:18:58,864
Zip up!

744
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:01,992
- Look, I'll call...
- Call who you want.

745
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:03,744
Zip up!

746
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:04,995
Come here!

747
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:07,873
- Now!
- You do it.

748
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:11,835
- Like this?.
- It's not allowed.

749
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:13,921
Or I'll leave.

750
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:16,798
Come here, I zipped.

751
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:19,885
I'm gonna hurt you.

752
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:22,763
No, I'm doing the hurting to you.

753
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:25,808
- Really?.
- What do you think?.

754
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:45,953
Don't do anything to me!

755
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:56,797
Where are the weapons?.

756
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:09,768
I'll give you one day
to put them back!

757
01:20:10,769 --> 01:20:11,937
Get the message?.

758
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:17,985
- Do I shoot them in the head?.
- Let them live a little more.

759
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,779
Get back in the car.

760
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:24,950
Get the message?.

761
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:36,962
Sweet Pea, get up!

762
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:43,760
Don't be scared, I'm here,
we're at war!

763
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:44,887
Get lost!

764
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:46,763
Get up!

765
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:53,854
Enough!

766
01:20:54,813 --> 01:20:56,815
Come here, don't worry!

767
01:20:57,816 --> 01:20:59,860
- I'm getting out of here.
- No!

768
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:01,945
We'll beat these guys!

769
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:03,989
Listen to me!

770
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,968
You're making me waste time,

771
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:29,765
you said you made a mark,
but where is it?.

772
01:21:29,848 --> 01:21:31,767
Oh, what is it?.

773
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:39,775
- Remember I made a mark!
- Yeah, but you can't find it!

774
01:21:42,903 --> 01:21:44,905
You're as dumb as they come.

775
01:21:58,752 --> 01:21:59,920
Took you half an hour!

776
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:02,756
Let's move, I have to shoot,

777
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,883
I can't stand not shooting!

778
01:22:05,801 --> 01:22:06,969
- Want to shoot?.
- Right away!

779
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:12,808
- Did you load it?.
- You'd better shut up.

780
01:22:12,891 --> 01:22:14,852
Sweet Pea, do like I tell you.

781
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:19,773
I don't give a fuck what you think.

782
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:22,818
We break everyone's balls,
but who've we killed?.

783
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:24,903
Do like I say and get moving!

784
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:27,865
Move!

785
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,908
Where are we going?.

786
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:32,870
Do I have to beat you up?.

787
01:22:33,829 --> 01:22:35,956
Do we have to war with each other?.

788
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:40,794
I'm not warring with you,
all we have to do is shoot!

789
01:22:40,878 --> 01:22:43,964
- We're going to shoot alone?.
- Yeah, just you and me!

790
01:22:44,756 --> 01:22:47,926
- Not thinking about later?.
- I don't want to think a thing!

791
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:51,805
Want to take the wrong steps,
we'll never grow that way.

792
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,932
Listening to you, we'll die sooner.

793
01:22:55,851 --> 01:22:57,811
Can I say something?.

794
01:22:58,854 --> 01:23:02,816
Those kids don't know how to behave,
they're just raising Cain.

795
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,777
- Why?.
- They didn't give the weapons back.

796
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:06,987
They don't want to listen.

797
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:09,865
I'll make them listen my way.

798
01:23:12,868 --> 01:23:14,745
I'll take these guys and kill them.

799
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:19,791
If you kill two kids,

800
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:22,920
what shits will we look like
in the territory

801
01:23:23,003 --> 01:23:25,797
when people find out?.

802
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:27,841
Are we joking?.

803
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:33,013
Then the cops come,
we have to lay low for a month

804
01:23:33,806 --> 01:23:35,849
and all the traffic ends.

805
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:42,898
Zio Vittorio, they can't be
lording it around in my area,

806
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:46,860
they've already done so much,
I've warned them more than once.

807
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:48,904
I can't consider them kids anymore.

808
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:51,865
They have to die, that's final!

809
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:55,869
You're right,
but first let's tell the families.

810
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:57,871
I don't know who they are.

811
01:23:59,873 --> 01:24:02,835
Will you take care of it?.

812
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,003
I'll handle it!

813
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:33,991
Toto, is that you?.

814
01:24:39,997 --> 01:24:42,958
- What happened to Silvana?.
- In the storeroom.

815
01:24:59,016 --> 01:25:01,810
How come it's so dark?.

816
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:03,854
Why are you in the dark?.

817
01:25:03,896 --> 01:25:05,772
It's okay like this.

818
01:25:06,023 --> 01:25:07,858
Your change.

819
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:12,905
- The bread?.
- There wasn't any.

820
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:15,908
- What'll we eat?.
- There's pasta.

821
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:21,788
- Take your change.
- It's for you.

822
01:25:31,882 --> 01:25:34,009
Why did you put her
in the storeroom?.

823
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:36,804
She's fine where she is.

824
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:39,848
She's just an animal!

825
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:52,963
Come here a minute,
I have to talk to you.

826
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:56,842
Don't come out, it's dangerous.

827
01:26:56,967 --> 01:26:58,969
Come on, no one can see you.

828
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:04,850
What are you doing, you're going?.

829
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:09,771
Listen to me!

830
01:27:10,022 --> 01:27:12,816
They said I have to leave.

831
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:14,985
I have to leave my house.

832
01:27:15,903 --> 01:27:17,863
I can't do anything.

833
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:19,907
I'm not leaving!

834
01:27:20,908 --> 01:27:22,868
Come here a minute!

835
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:32,002
Tell those friends of yours,
I'm not leaving!

836
01:27:33,837 --> 01:27:35,881
Tell those nice people!

837
01:27:36,006 --> 01:27:39,843
I won't betray my son
and I'm not moving from here!

838
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:43,847
Not coming in for coffee?.

839
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:45,808
Run off, run away!

840
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:25,973
Hello, accountant.

841
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:27,891
Please come in.

842
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:31,979
Why this sudden call?.

843
01:28:32,813 --> 01:28:33,939
You're worrying me.

844
01:28:34,815 --> 01:28:36,817
The designers pay me after 60 days,

845
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,944
I have a little money,

846
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:41,780
but this wasn't the agreement.

847
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:43,907
Money isn't the problem.

848
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:46,869
What is it then?.

849
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:48,871
It seems

850
01:28:49,913 --> 01:28:51,957
the problem is in your own house.

851
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,918
In my house?.

852
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:56,962
What problem is it?.

853
01:28:58,046 --> 01:28:59,965
One of your associates,

854
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,885
Pasquale Del Prete,

855
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:04,845
has sold out to the Chinese.

856
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,857
We're done.

857
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:21,945
The finishing touches...

858
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,831
I never doubted.

859
01:29:51,975 --> 01:29:53,852
Everything okay?.

860
01:29:56,939 --> 01:29:59,942
Remember the first time
I put you to work in the factory?.

861
01:30:00,025 --> 01:30:01,944
You were just a kid.

862
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:05,030
Right.

863
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:17,000
- Everything alright?.
- Yes.

864
01:30:40,858 --> 01:30:43,902
Tell him to go slower, not too fast.

865
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:59,001
Well done, Giulia.

866
01:30:59,877 --> 01:31:00,961
She's good.

867
01:31:31,909 --> 01:31:33,869
In the morning I do Tai Chi.

868
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:34,953
Really?.

869
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:38,040
- It's nice.
- It is good for your health.

870
01:31:38,874 --> 01:31:40,918
It is like in China.

871
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:45,839
When you go to the park
in the morning, it is full of people

872
01:31:46,965 --> 01:31:48,884
old people too.

873
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:51,845
All doing Tai Chi.

874
01:31:51,929 --> 01:31:53,055
Everyone

875
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:56,850
Iikes the culture of Tai Chi.

876
01:31:58,852 --> 01:32:01,021
It's a tradition of Chinese culture.

877
01:32:01,855 --> 01:32:03,941
When will you do egg rolls for me?.

878
01:32:58,036 --> 01:32:59,830
Wait up.

879
01:33:01,874 --> 01:33:04,960
I spoke to the doctors,
you'll soon be released.

880
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:13,886
Damn you,

881
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:15,929
you really goofed up.

882
01:33:17,973 --> 01:33:21,852
They loved the models,
they've asked for more...

883
01:33:21,935 --> 01:33:23,854
You knew everything.

884
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:26,023
That's how I saved your life.

885
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:29,860
Those people don't kid around.

886
01:33:29,985 --> 01:33:31,862
Leave me alone.

887
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:35,866
You should thank me,
those guys will kill you.

888
01:33:35,908 --> 01:33:37,951
You and I pulled through.

889
01:33:38,035 --> 01:33:40,996
- Find another tailor.
- Why do you say that?.

890
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:44,917
- I want to be alone.
- How can I do this without you?.

891
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,877
I really don't care.

892
01:33:47,002 --> 01:33:50,881
- After all I've done for you.
- What have you done for me?.

893
01:33:50,923 --> 01:33:54,009
I took you off the streets,
I fed you for years.

894
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:57,805
-You've used me since I was a kid.
- Don't say that!

895
01:33:58,931 --> 01:34:02,059
When you're better,
come see me, I'll give you a raise.

896
01:34:04,061 --> 01:34:07,898
Rosa, give me that bike,
I have to go.

897
01:35:33,066 --> 01:35:35,068
No admittance here,

898
01:35:35,861 --> 01:35:37,029
that's it.

899
01:35:51,084 --> 01:35:53,045
Want to give up?.

900
01:35:53,879 --> 01:35:56,006
Are we meat for the slaughter house?.

901
01:36:04,848 --> 01:36:06,809
Let's shoot,
we'll rack up corpses too.

902
01:36:06,934 --> 01:36:08,018
Corpses?.

903
01:36:09,019 --> 01:36:12,815
- I'm not moving without orders.
- What orders?.

904
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:14,983
We don't know how to move.

905
01:36:16,985 --> 01:36:18,946
We don't know anything.

906
01:36:22,032 --> 01:36:24,827
Do we have to keep taking it?.

907
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:27,037
Do we have to wait for orders?.

908
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,000
Let's rack up corpses.

909
01:36:32,084 --> 01:36:35,921
What are we waiting for,
to be put down one by one?.

910
01:36:39,883 --> 01:36:42,010
If we don't move, nothing will change

911
01:36:42,094 --> 01:36:44,054
No use feeling depressed.

912
01:36:45,973 --> 01:36:47,975
We all have to be convinced.

913
01:36:48,058 --> 01:36:50,894
But without orders, I'm not moving.

914
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:55,023
This is open war,

915
01:36:55,858 --> 01:36:57,818
you mustn't think about anyone.

916
01:36:57,943 --> 01:37:00,988
- Who do we kill?.
- Let's begin in our area.

917
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:04,032
From our own stronghold.

918
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:06,994
We don't know who's with us
and who's against us,

919
01:37:07,077 --> 01:37:09,079
who do we make pay?.

920
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:12,916
Where do you think
the order to kill came from?.

921
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,084
Think!

922
01:37:15,878 --> 01:37:17,838
Where did it come from?.

923
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:20,883
- From there of course.
- From our own area.

924
01:37:20,966 --> 01:37:22,926
She betrayed us.

925
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:25,053
We don't touch women.

926
01:37:25,846 --> 01:37:26,972
Don't yell!

927
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:29,933
What are you saying?.

928
01:37:33,061 --> 01:37:36,940
Don't take it out on someone
no part of this, but the son.

929
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:40,861
- How do we find him?.
- His mother's in our district.

930
01:37:40,903 --> 01:37:42,863
It was her son who killed Gaetano.

931
01:37:42,988 --> 01:37:44,948
Let's think what we'll do.

932
01:37:45,949 --> 01:37:47,993
We could use the kid.

933
01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:50,913
He's the only one who can get to her.

934
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:53,957
He brings her shopping,

935
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:56,084
he's in good with the woman...

936
01:37:57,002 --> 01:37:59,004
So, if we have to do it

937
01:37:59,087 --> 01:38:01,048
we'll need his help.

938
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:05,886
Toto, what do you think you'll do?.

939
01:38:07,012 --> 01:38:09,056
Are you with us or against us?.

940
01:38:15,896 --> 01:38:17,856
What do you say?.

941
01:38:19,024 --> 01:38:20,984
Are you with us or not?.

942
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:25,864
- We'll see what we can do.
- No, "we'll see".

943
01:38:25,906 --> 01:38:27,950
Either you're with us
or you're against us,

944
01:38:28,909 --> 01:38:30,869
one or the other.

945
01:38:30,911 --> 01:38:34,873
If you're against us you can't leave,
we can't trust you.

946
01:38:34,957 --> 01:38:37,042
It can't have been her.

947
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:39,920
This is our decision,

948
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:41,964
you have to be with us.

949
01:38:42,047 --> 01:38:45,050
That's what we say,
you don't need to think.

950
01:38:49,972 --> 01:38:51,932
What are you going to do?.

951
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:56,019
- We'll see.
- I said no "we'll see".

952
01:39:11,910 --> 01:39:12,953
Come on down.

953
01:39:13,036 --> 01:39:14,997
I have to tell you something!

954
01:39:16,957 --> 01:39:18,834
No, come down!

955
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,004
Hurry, I have to leave!

956
01:40:58,976 --> 01:41:00,060
Sit down!

957
01:41:36,972 --> 01:41:38,932
You've known me for years,

958
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:41,059
you know what I've always done.

959
01:41:42,978 --> 01:41:44,855
I brought the money.

960
01:41:44,938 --> 01:41:46,982
I brought it to your family too.

961
01:41:48,942 --> 01:41:50,986
I did it because I was ordered to.

962
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:57,951
War isn't for me.

963
01:41:58,118 --> 01:42:00,954
But you're in it, know that?.

964
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:03,999
Yes.

965
01:42:04,124 --> 01:42:05,918
So?.

966
01:42:06,084 --> 01:42:07,878
You tell me.

967
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:09,838
What can I tell you?.

968
01:42:13,091 --> 01:42:15,886
What did you come here for?.

969
01:42:17,888 --> 01:42:19,056
To talk to you.

970
01:42:19,932 --> 01:42:21,058
About what?.

971
01:42:24,937 --> 01:42:26,897
I want to save myself.

972
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,066
You'll have to buy your life,

973
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,860
I won't give it to you.

974
01:42:36,073 --> 01:42:38,033
What I did there,

975
01:42:39,034 --> 01:42:41,036
I can do for you here.

976
01:42:41,912 --> 01:42:43,956
We don't need money-carriers,

977
01:42:43,997 --> 01:42:47,042
we have to score,
kill people, and we need money.

978
01:42:48,085 --> 01:42:49,962
You're wasting your time.

979
01:42:53,048 --> 01:42:54,967
You're more dead than alive.

980
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:57,928
But we were brothers before.

981
01:42:58,011 --> 01:42:59,012
Before!

982
01:42:59,096 --> 01:43:02,015
Then they started
messing around with shit.

983
01:43:06,937 --> 01:43:08,981
Our relatives were good people...

984
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:11,984
so they killed them!

985
01:43:13,944 --> 01:43:15,070
So, don't come asking

986
01:43:15,904 --> 01:43:17,072
to pass to the other side.

987
01:43:17,906 --> 01:43:19,950
We have to score, kill,

988
01:43:20,033 --> 01:43:21,994
and we need money.

989
01:43:22,911 --> 01:43:24,079
If not, you die,

990
01:43:24,913 --> 01:43:26,915
because you're part of the war.

991
01:43:26,957 --> 01:43:28,959
You bring money and I kill people,

992
01:43:29,084 --> 01:43:31,920
we're the same, you and me,
in this war.

993
01:43:33,046 --> 01:43:35,007
- I understand.
- You understand.

994
01:43:45,893 --> 01:43:47,060
Wait a moment.

995
01:44:17,132 --> 01:44:19,009
Everything okay?.

996
01:44:21,136 --> 01:44:23,013
And you?.

997
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,897
That's four.

998
01:44:42,074 --> 01:44:44,034
Face on the table!

999
01:44:44,868 --> 01:44:46,078
Done?.

1000
01:44:47,037 --> 01:44:48,080
Let's go!

1001
01:44:56,046 --> 01:44:57,881
Come on out!

1002
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:00,050
Lucky, eh?.

1003
01:46:23,008 --> 01:46:24,968
That's poison.

1004
01:46:26,136 --> 01:46:28,096
What'd he say?.

1005
01:46:28,931 --> 01:46:32,059
My father wants to say the dumping
you're doing on our land

1006
01:46:32,893 --> 01:46:34,019
isn't garbage.

1007
01:46:34,895 --> 01:46:36,021
It's poison.

1008
01:46:36,146 --> 01:46:38,065
It's not garbage?.

1009
01:46:39,942 --> 01:46:41,109
You heard right.

1010
01:46:41,944 --> 01:46:43,070
Don't worry.

1011
01:46:43,946 --> 01:46:46,949
A year's gone by with this dumping?.

1012
01:46:48,075 --> 01:46:50,994
So far,
all we've done is pay our debts.

1013
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:53,121
Just barely.

1014
01:46:53,914 --> 01:46:57,084
- Euro.
- I understand, Don Raffaele.

1015
01:46:59,962 --> 01:47:02,089
Everything costs double in euro.

1016
01:47:03,006 --> 01:47:04,091
And so?.

1017
01:47:05,884 --> 01:47:07,136
We need something more.

1018
01:47:09,012 --> 01:47:11,932
These are the prices,
explain it to your kids,

1019
01:47:12,015 --> 01:47:14,977
if I do it for you,
I have to do it for everyone.

1020
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:17,020
Don't put me
in a difficult situation.

1021
01:47:17,104 --> 01:47:20,983
Okay, if you give us more,
everyone has to get more.

1022
01:47:21,024 --> 01:47:22,985
So, little can be done.

1023
01:47:23,068 --> 01:47:25,112
But, we barely make ends meet,

1024
01:47:25,946 --> 01:47:27,948
we can't go on like this.

1025
01:47:28,031 --> 01:47:29,992
We were thinking,

1026
01:47:31,076 --> 01:47:34,037
is it possible to do more dumping?.

1027
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:37,916
Euro...

1028
01:47:38,083 --> 01:47:40,085
More dumping?.

1029
01:47:40,919 --> 01:47:43,881
We have another piece of land
for other dumping sites.

1030
01:47:43,964 --> 01:47:45,132
Near here?.

1031
01:47:46,049 --> 01:47:47,926
Around here.

1032
01:47:47,968 --> 01:47:49,928
More dumping we do,

1033
01:47:50,053 --> 01:47:52,055
faster the ground gets filled.

1034
01:47:52,139 --> 01:47:54,933
You have another piece of land?.

1035
01:47:55,934 --> 01:47:58,103
- Near here?.
- Further on.

1036
01:47:58,937 --> 01:48:01,940
This other land
would be more convenient,

1037
01:48:01,982 --> 01:48:04,985
it's bigger and trucks
can get in easier.

1038
01:48:06,111 --> 01:48:07,905
But...

1039
01:48:09,907 --> 01:48:11,867
Still 100 euros per dumping.

1040
01:48:11,992 --> 01:48:13,911
What do you mean 100 euros!

1041
01:48:14,036 --> 01:48:15,996
Don't speak out of turn.

1042
01:48:16,038 --> 01:48:18,040
- He can't increase!
- Who said so?.

1043
01:48:18,916 --> 01:48:20,918
We'll increase the trucks.

1044
01:48:22,002 --> 01:48:25,047
You have to increase
the price of each dumping.

1045
01:48:26,089 --> 01:48:27,966
Want to lose everything?.

1046
01:48:28,050 --> 01:48:30,093
They have nowhere else to turn.

1047
01:48:30,886 --> 01:48:31,929
Excuse me.

1048
01:48:32,012 --> 01:48:33,889
Don't worry.

1049
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:37,100
Alright, now we'll reach...

1050
01:48:42,022 --> 01:48:43,941
an agreement.

1051
01:48:44,024 --> 01:48:46,068
Give him a glass of water.

1052
01:48:46,151 --> 01:48:48,111
I'll do it, don't worry.

1053
01:48:57,955 --> 01:48:58,956
Luca!

1054
01:49:06,046 --> 01:49:08,090
You have to clean up this field!

1055
01:49:09,049 --> 01:49:10,884
I'm not Luca.

1056
01:49:11,009 --> 01:49:12,970
Do a little work.

1057
01:49:13,053 --> 01:49:14,972
My name's Roberto.

1058
01:49:17,057 --> 01:49:19,101
This field is such a mess.

1059
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,937
All such a mess.

1060
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:24,148
Ma'am, it's raining.

1061
01:49:25,899 --> 01:49:27,025
Should I stop?.

1062
01:49:27,151 --> 01:49:29,069
Come out of there.

1063
01:49:31,947 --> 01:49:33,907
I'll take you inside.

1064
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:36,034
I'll be right along.

1065
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,078
They've made ditches here,

1066
01:49:38,954 --> 01:49:40,914
someone should come

1067
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:42,958
to fill them.

1068
01:49:55,971 --> 01:49:57,014
Let's go!

1069
01:50:09,067 --> 01:50:10,986
What beautiful peaches, thank you!

1070
01:50:11,069 --> 01:50:13,030
I'll take them to the kids.

1071
01:50:13,155 --> 01:50:15,115
See how beautiful they are!

1072
01:50:16,158 --> 01:50:17,993
Let's go.

1073
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:20,120
Put them in the car.

1074
01:50:20,162 --> 01:50:21,955
Come on!

1075
01:50:34,968 --> 01:50:36,929
Toss that stuff.

1076
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:39,056
- What?.
- The peaches.

1077
01:50:39,139 --> 01:50:41,141
Can't you smell how they stink?.

1078
01:51:01,995 --> 01:51:03,122
Done?.

1079
01:51:20,097 --> 01:51:21,140
What?.

1080
01:51:21,932 --> 01:51:22,975
Listen,

1081
01:51:23,976 --> 01:51:25,936
I've been thinking.

1082
01:51:26,979 --> 01:51:29,064
Maybe I'm not cut out for this work.

1083
01:51:29,148 --> 01:51:30,983
What?.

1084
01:51:31,066 --> 01:51:32,943
I mean it.

1085
01:51:34,069 --> 01:51:36,029
I'm not up to it.

1086
01:51:36,113 --> 01:51:38,157
We're doing so well!

1087
01:51:39,908 --> 01:51:40,951
No,

1088
01:51:41,952 --> 01:51:43,162
I don't want to work anymore,

1089
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:45,038
I'm sorry.

1090
01:51:51,962 --> 01:51:53,964
Think this job sucks?.

1091
01:51:54,047 --> 01:51:58,010
You know that guys like me
put this shit country in Europe?.

1092
01:51:58,093 --> 01:52:01,096
Know how many workers I've helped
by saving their companies money?.

1093
01:52:01,972 --> 01:52:03,056
Stop and look!

1094
01:52:04,141 --> 01:52:06,059
What do you see?.

1095
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:09,104
Debts.

1096
01:52:09,938 --> 01:52:12,900
All these people have been saved
only thanks to us.

1097
01:52:14,985 --> 01:52:16,987
I saw how you help them live.

1098
01:52:17,112 --> 01:52:20,073
You save a worker in Mestre
and kill a family in Mondragone.

1099
01:52:20,157 --> 01:52:22,993
That's how it works,
but I didn't decide it.

1100
01:52:23,911 --> 01:52:26,079
We solve problems created by others.

1101
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:29,041
I didn't create
chromium and asbestos,

1102
01:52:29,082 --> 01:52:31,084
I didn't dig up the mountain.

1103
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:33,170
That's how it works?.

1104
01:52:34,004 --> 01:52:35,964
I don't work that way.

1105
01:52:36,924 --> 01:52:38,091
I'm not like you.

1106
01:52:38,967 --> 01:52:41,053
- What are you like?.
- I'm different.

1107
01:52:45,057 --> 01:52:47,017
Go make pizzas!

1108
01:52:47,142 --> 01:52:49,019
He's different.

1109
01:52:51,939 --> 01:52:54,024
Don't think you're better than me!

1110
01:52:55,067 --> 01:52:57,069
I gave you a chance!

1111
01:52:59,947 --> 01:53:01,073
Go fuck yourself!

1112
01:53:59,047 --> 01:54:02,134
I think Scarlett Johansson's here!

1113
01:54:03,093 --> 01:54:04,970
Splendid, magnificent,

1114
01:54:06,054 --> 01:54:08,098
all dressed in white,

1115
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:11,143
cream.

1116
01:54:12,019 --> 01:54:13,979
In style with the film.

1117
01:54:15,105 --> 01:54:18,108
Right colors,
right choice of dress.

1118
01:54:19,985 --> 01:54:23,113
It would be nice to know
why it took so long to get ready...

1119
01:54:25,908 --> 01:54:27,117
Because it's chic

1120
01:54:28,952 --> 01:54:30,913
yet so sophisticated.

1121
01:54:30,996 --> 01:54:35,042
An apparent simplicity,
but in reality, very elaborate...

1122
01:54:35,125 --> 01:54:37,044
Allow me to say...

1123
01:54:37,127 --> 01:54:41,048
Maybe to be awaited as a true star.

1124
01:54:41,089 --> 01:54:43,091
She's a star, and so beautiful.

1125
01:54:45,135 --> 01:54:47,179
The photographers are going crazy.

1126
01:54:49,181 --> 01:54:51,099
And the people too...

1127
01:55:56,081 --> 01:55:58,167
May I sit at your table?.

1128
01:56:04,089 --> 01:56:06,967
- Can I offer you a cigarette?.
- We don't smoke.

1129
01:56:09,052 --> 01:56:11,013
Everyone here talks about you.

1130
01:56:12,014 --> 01:56:14,141
You kids have balls, I can use you.

1131
01:56:15,976 --> 01:56:18,145
Why don't you join my guys?.

1132
01:56:19,146 --> 01:56:21,106
You'll have money, motorbikes,

1133
01:56:21,190 --> 01:56:23,150
anything you want.

1134
01:56:23,984 --> 01:56:25,986
I already saved you once,

1135
01:56:26,028 --> 01:56:28,071
because here
they don't like you guys.

1136
01:56:28,989 --> 01:56:31,033
You're causing too much trouble.

1137
01:56:31,992 --> 01:56:33,952
It's wise to be with me,

1138
01:56:34,036 --> 01:56:35,954
that way you don't have to worry,
you're covered.

1139
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:39,082
We want to stay alone,

1140
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:41,919
we don't want to be under anyone.

1141
01:56:42,085 --> 01:56:44,129
We don't like to be under people.

1142
01:56:45,172 --> 01:56:47,049
We're just for us, that's all.

1143
01:56:49,092 --> 01:56:51,136
May I confide in you?.

1144
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:54,139
It's obvious you're courageous.

1145
01:56:54,973 --> 01:56:57,017
You're not talking to cops.

1146
01:56:58,101 --> 01:56:59,144
What is it?.

1147
01:56:59,978 --> 01:57:03,941
I have a good job for you
and you'll earn a barrel of money.

1148
01:57:04,024 --> 01:57:06,151
- Money?.
- Money's the first thing.

1149
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,070
We know.

1150
01:57:10,155 --> 01:57:13,116
- May I come closer?.
- Sure.

1151
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:16,078
It's something not to be overheard,
just between us.

1152
01:57:17,121 --> 01:57:19,081
I need a big favor,

1153
01:57:19,164 --> 01:57:21,125
you could do a "job" for me.

1154
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,002
I see you've got balls,

1155
01:57:24,169 --> 01:57:28,006
but this guy's a hot one, he's big.

1156
01:57:28,966 --> 01:57:31,135
We really like these things.

1157
01:57:31,969 --> 01:57:33,095
I'm crazy for them.

1158
01:57:33,971 --> 01:57:36,056
You have to kill Peppe the Horseman.

1159
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:38,976
He's a traitor, he took my woman.

1160
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:43,188
You have to shoot him in the balls

1161
01:57:43,981 --> 01:57:45,941
and then in the mouth.

1162
01:57:46,066 --> 01:57:48,110
I go crazy for these things.

1163
01:57:49,027 --> 01:57:51,029
But you have to do me a favor.

1164
01:57:52,156 --> 01:57:56,118
They told me you
stole some weapons from around here.

1165
01:57:57,995 --> 01:58:00,164
You have to give them back,
we gotta make them disappear.

1166
01:58:00,998 --> 01:58:03,083
- I'll give you the weapons.
- You will?.

1167
01:58:03,167 --> 01:58:06,086
Weapons, motorbikes,
anything you want.

1168
01:58:06,170 --> 01:58:08,130
Let's talk about the money.

1169
01:58:08,964 --> 01:58:11,925
Tell me what you want
for this job.

1170
01:58:12,092 --> 01:58:14,052
A really good amount.

1171
01:58:14,178 --> 01:58:16,930
Is 10,000 euro enough?.

1172
01:58:19,057 --> 01:58:20,100
Yes.

1173
01:58:20,184 --> 01:58:23,103
I'll give you an advance,
the rest when the job's done.

1174
01:58:33,155 --> 01:58:35,073
Put it in your pocket.

1175
01:58:36,116 --> 01:58:38,994
- Is it right?.
- Fine.

1176
02:00:07,166 --> 02:00:09,084
- Not there.
- Then where?.

1177
02:00:10,127 --> 02:00:13,088
- Where the fuck do we go?.
- Who knows where he went!

1178
02:00:16,008 --> 02:00:18,093
- We lost him.
- Are you sure?.

1179
02:00:20,179 --> 02:00:23,098
- Look over there.
- There's nothin'.

1180
02:00:25,184 --> 02:00:27,019
Then where?.

1181
02:00:28,061 --> 02:00:29,188
There he is!

1182
02:02:15,127 --> 02:02:16,962
Get off.

1183
02:02:31,101 --> 02:02:32,144
Come on!

1184
02:03:34,206 --> 02:03:37,084
For two kids such a waste of time.

1185
02:03:37,167 --> 02:03:39,086
Guys, it had to be done.

1186
02:03:39,169 --> 02:03:41,088
Everything's okay.

1187
02:05:27,194 --> 02:05:30,239
In Europe the Camorra has killed more
than all other criminal organizations

1188
02:05:31,073 --> 02:05:34,034
4,000 deaths in the last thirty years
One every three days.

1189
02:05:34,201 --> 02:05:37,996
Scampia is the biggest
drug-pushing locality in the world.

1190
02:05:38,122 --> 02:05:41,083
Daily sales per clan
run about 500,000 euro.

1191
02:05:42,042 --> 02:05:45,045
If clan-managed waste were piled
it would reach 14,600 meters.

1192
02:05:45,129 --> 02:05:47,089
Everest is 8,850 meters.

1193
02:05:47,172 --> 02:05:50,092
There is a 20/ increase in cancer
in the poisoned areas.

1194
02:05:51,009 --> 02:05:55,055
Gains from illegal activities are
reinvested in legal ones worldwide.

1195
02:05:55,139 --> 02:05:59,101
The Camorra has also invested in the
reconstruction of the Twin Towers.
