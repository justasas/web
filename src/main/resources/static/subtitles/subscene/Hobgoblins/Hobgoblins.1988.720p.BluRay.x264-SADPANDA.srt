1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,952
(coyote howls)

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,217
(rock music)

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,980
- Dennis.

4
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:29,855
Dennis!

5
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,902
- Hey, what gives?

6
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,323
- You're being paid
to work around here!

7
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,076
Not to sit around and
blast your eardrums.

8
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,872
- Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

9
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:43,869
I can do both.

10
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,918
(phone ringing)

11
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,792
(dial tone)
- Hello?

12
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:49,666
Hello?

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,886
Didn't you hear
the phone ringing?

14
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,339
- No, I didn't.

15
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,300
- [McCreedy] They've
already hung up!

16
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,555
- Well then it couldn't
have been too important.

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,182
- Don't you have any
sense of responsibility?

18
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,230
That could have been
a very important call.

19
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,354
- [Dennis] At this hour?

20
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,935
- In the future would
you just answer the phone

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,441
no matter what hour it is, and
not make your own decisions

22
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,694
about what's important
and what isn't?

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,445
- Yeah, yeah, right, right.

24
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,869
- It's time for our rounds.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,641
(eerie music)

26
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,063
Did I ever tell you
what the studio was like

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,810
when I first started here?

28
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,232
- Yeah, more than once.

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,607
- Oh, it used to be one of
the busiest lots in town.

30
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,440
- It's a real thriving
metropolis now.

31
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,572
Hey wait a minute,
what's this down here?

32
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,871
- Oh, it's just
an old film vault,

33
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,163
there's nothing down there.

34
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,957
- Yeah, but why don't
we check it anyway?

35
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,535
- I'm telling you there's
nothing down there,

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,044
and I'm not going to waste
my time checking it out.

37
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,170
- [Voiceover] McCreedy.

38
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,296
- What is it now?

39
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,797
- [Voiceover] I need
to talk to you now.

40
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,503
- Well I can't right now.

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,260
- [Voiceover] Now, I mean it.

42
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,262
- Finish the rounds.

43
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,140
And remember what I said.

44
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,312
- Whatever you say, Pops.

45
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,203
(faint rock music in headphones)

46
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,425
(intense music)

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,151
- What took you so long?

48
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,649
- I made it as
quickly as I could,

49
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,401
I was clear across the lot.

50
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,984
- You're not as young
as you used to be.

51
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,284
I tried calling you at
the main gate before,

52
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,487
why didn't you answer the phone?

53
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,949
- I must have caught
it just as you hung up.

54
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,161
- Well let's be a little
more efficient from now on.

55
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,336
How's the new boy doing?

56
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,164
- Fine, fine.

57
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,669
But I really need to get back.

58
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,343
- Just a minute, I want
talk to you about these

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,422
beer cans I found
in the front gate.

60
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,434
(ominous music)

61
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,101
- So there's nothing down here.

62
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,739
I wonder what they keep in here.

63
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,079
Yoohoo, Mr. McCreedy?

64
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,792
(growling)

65
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,145
Is somebody there?

66
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,522
(growling)

67
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,529
Is somebody there?

68
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,866
(radio static)

69
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,755
- I'll give you a
report in the morning.

70
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,233
(feedback squealing)

71
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,657
(crowd cheering)

72
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,280
(rock music)

73
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,319
(cries out)

74
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,455
(creepy music)

75
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,564
(door slams shut)

76
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,786
(eerie music)

77
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,528
- Another one quit?!

78
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,241
What was the problem this time?

79
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,493
- I'm not sure what
the problem was, sir.

80
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,665
- It wasn't something
you said to him, was it?

81
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,867
- [McCreedy] It could have been.

82
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,545
- I'm holding you responsible
for this, McCreedy.

83
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,873
Every time we hire a
new guard he only lasts

84
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,504
for a couple of
weeks, then he's gone.

85
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,131
How many is it now, three, four?

86
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,338
- It's three, and I
really don't think

87
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,548
you need to hire anyone else.

88
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,680
I can run the post myself.

89
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,012
- Look, you've been
here for a long time.

90
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,393
You know as well as I
do that we need to have

91
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,565
a second guard ready so
he can fill in for you

92
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,019
if you can't make
it here some night.

93
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,901
- But I've never missed a
night since I've been here!

94
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,198
- You're not as young as
you used to be, we need

95
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,616
to be prepared.

96
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,615
Do you know that if something
were to happen to this studio

97
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,040
while no one was on duty,
our insurance is voided?

98
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,208
- This place has been
deserted for almost 30 years.

99
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,537
- Stop making excuses.

100
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,338
I want you to hire a new guard,

101
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,668
and this time hire one who
will stick around for a while.

102
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,798
Or else I'll hire two.

103
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,096
- So, Kevin, is this the
first time that you've worked

104
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,393
as a security guard?

105
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,598
- Yes sir, but I'm a very
fast learner, and I promise

106
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,683
to try extra hard.

107
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,734
And I really need the job.

108
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,237
- Well you sound very
mature for your age.

109
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,320
You don't own one of those
portable radios with headphones,

110
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,198
do you?

111
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,037
- No sir.

112
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,208
- That's good, I think
we'll get along just fine.

113
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,205
Now, are you ready for
your first tour of the lot?

114
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,625
- Oh, oh yes sir, even
prepared to take notes.

115
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,008
- It's not that complicated.

116
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,187
You've never been on a
studio lot like this before,

117
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,362
have you?

118
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,689
- No sir.

119
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,445
- Well, it's not that
difficult to keep track of.

120
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,528
Now there isn't much
goes on here anymore.

121
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,113
- How long have you
been working here?

122
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,540
- Oh, quite a while.

123
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,742
About 30 years, actually.

124
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,668
And I've never missed
a day and had to have

125
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,122
someone fill in for me.

126
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,549
- 30 years, that's amazing.

127
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,875
- Well, not really.

128
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,961
You know, time
becomes sort of a blur

129
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,297
when you reach a certain age.

130
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,132
Sometime I'll tell you
what this place was like

131
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,934
when it was still a
functioning studio.

132
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,637
- I'd like to hear about that.

133
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,396
(mysterious music)

134
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,655
- Now Kevin, if I told
you that something

135
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,655
was very important, you'd
listen to me, wouldn't you?

136
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,781
- Of course.

137
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,111
- Good.

138
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,822
Now there is a part of
this lot that I want you

139
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,623
to stay away from.

140
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,873
I don't want to have to
explain all the details to you,

141
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,001
I just want you to promise
to stay clear of it.

142
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,878
- I understand.

143
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,882
- Now this is the part
I was telling you about.

144
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,429
- What's down there?

145
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,681
- It's just a lot of
dangerous machinery.

146
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,853
Now don't go in there and
take the chance of injuring

147
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,101
yourself, do you understand?

148
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:57,773
- Yeah.

149
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,360
- Good, now I don't
want to have to

150
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,529
remind you a second time.

151
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,154
Just stay clear of this area.

152
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,878
- So is there anything else
I need to be made aware of?

153
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,001
- There is one other thing.

154
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,092
This is what I was
telling you about.

155
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,895
Oh, but don't worry, I've
never had to use it.

156
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,221
- Really?

157
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,979
- That's right, not in all
the years I've been here.

158
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,028
But I would like to show you
how to use it sometime though,

159
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,402
you never know when
you might need it.

160
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,076
(ominous music)

161
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,184
- Hi.

162
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,686
- Not now, your
friends are here.

163
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,570
- Hey, how's it going?

164
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,192
- What'd you bring,
some new music?

165
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,619
- No, I just rented a
videotape that Amy and I

166
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,945
were gonna watch.

167
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,371
- Well that was very nice.

168
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,370
- Let me see what you got.

169
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,951
What?

170
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,752
Don't you ever get any tapes
from the adult section?

171
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,330
My boyfriend would
never bring me a tape

172
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,336
that didn't have at
least a single X rating.

173
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,917
- Well Kevin isn't like that.

174
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,049
He would never want me to see
anything that was rated X.

175
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,221
Would you?

176
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,798
- No, I wouldn't.

177
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,851
(horn beeps)

178
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,238
- Oh right man, I'd
recognize that horn anywhere,

179
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,530
that's my Nick.

180
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,199
Back from two months
of army training,

181
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,528
and you know what a man
wants when he's been away

182
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,612
for two months.

183
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,698
- No, what does he want?

184
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:19,577
- Woo!

185
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,508
It's been two months!

186
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,806
♪ Whoa everybody
have sex tonight

187
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,687
(laughing)

188
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,392
- Wish that were our theme song.

189
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,852
- Did you say something?

190
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:48,982
- No, no.

191
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,748
- I wanna hear about everything
you did in basic training.

192
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,076
- Well we had to get up every
morning about 4 am, you know?

193
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,582
- Sounds like loads of fun.

194
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,959
- Then there was calisthenics,
a daily run for six miles.

195
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,882
- Oh, I bet you
got really sweaty.

196
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,755
- Oh, you know I did.

197
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,131
After that, firing range.

198
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,053
(imitating gunfire)

199
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,800
And tear gas training.

200
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,178
Then there was
infiltration course.

201
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,601
- Big deal, I have access
to a gun where I work.

202
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,929
- Yeah well it's a
big difference between having

203
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,889
something and knowing how to use it.

204
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,099
- Would it be okay
if I used your phone?

205
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,060
- Yeah, sure.

206
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,394
Who you gonna call?

207
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,775
- My girlfriend.

208
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,947
- Hey we ever gonna get a
chance to meet this girl?

209
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,532
- Uh, I don't think so,
she's kind of shy.

210
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,989
- What else did you
do with the gun?

211
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,829
- Well I haven't actually had
a chance to fire it yet, but--

212
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,910
- I was talking to Nick.

213
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,082
- Then we had target practice.

214
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,133
But I never had an actual
chance to shoot anyone.

215
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,005
Yet.

216
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,554
- Shooting someone, is
that real important to you?

217
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,010
- Well, yeah!

218
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,794
(sultry music)

219
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,498
(phone ringing)

220
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,550
- Hi, it's me Fantasia.

221
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,133
Thanks for calling.

222
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,260
I'm going to see a movie today.

223
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,717
It's only rated PG.

224
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,520
I want you to show up
and make it rated X.

225
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,099
Sneak in the rear door and
when the lights go down,

226
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,607
drop your pants and
show me a full moon.

227
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,699
Wave that lunar eclipse and
block the projection beam.

228
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:03,037
Next, pull me down and roll
me on those sticky floors.

229
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,992
Lick that artificial
butter flavor off my body.

230
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,909
Hold, please.

231
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,878
Then take my clothes
and leave me naked

232
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,675
so that when the
lights come up, I'll be

233
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,004
the second feature.

234
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,885
- You sure that's
not long distance?

235
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,261
- No, it's not.

236
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,851
- That's good.

237
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,143
Because I have to keep
calling the phone company

238
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,893
every month because of
all these sex line calls

239
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,519
being billed to my number.

240
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,771
- Really?

241
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,147
That's too bad.

242
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,569
- Thanks for calling.

243
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,198
A new adventure
awaits you tomorrow.

244
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,700
(dial tone)

245
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,792
- Oh yeah, and then
we spend all afternoon

246
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,419
studying hand to hand combat.

247
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,501
- I know about the techniques
you have with your hands.

248
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,302
Tell us about something else.

249
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,676
- Yeah, could we change
the subject already?

250
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,008
- Why don't you pay attention

251
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,684
and maybe you'll
learn something.

252
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,557
Nick is protecting our country.

253
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,014
And you're just guarding some
rundown deserted dump.

254
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,394
- What did you say?

255
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:15,067
- Why don't you be nice
to Nick and maybe he'll

256
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,235
teach you something.

257
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,063
- Yeah I could teach you all
about hand to hand combat,

258
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:19,863
with no problem.

259
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,190
- Yeah.

260
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,359
- Well go on, I
know you can do it.

261
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,945
- Look, I said I wasn't
interested, okay?

262
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,824
- Come on.

263
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,211
- You're gonna love this.

264
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,758
- I don't wanna do this.

265
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,211
- Here, take this.

266
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,427
Okay, no no no,
hold it like this.

267
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,513
Okay, now block every
move that I make.

268
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,934
I'm gonna take it
really slow on you.

269
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,971
So watch out 'cause here
comes the first one!

270
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,476
- Go Kevin! Show him you can do it!

271
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,649
- Go Nick, kick his butt!

272
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,238
(exciting music)

273
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,910
Oh, he's getting so sweaty already.

274
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,758
Yeah, go for it!

275
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,308
(hits)
(cries out)

276
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,547
- Ah!

277
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,718
(cries out)

278
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,589
- You give up?

279
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,264
- Yes!

280
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,019
- My hero!

281
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,989
- You really humiliated me.

282
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,323
- What?

283
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,751
I didn't even want to do
this, it was your idea.

284
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,294
- I don't care
whose idea it was,

285
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,996
I wanted you to win.

286
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,332
- How was I supposed
to win, Amy?

287
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,633
I've never even
done this before.

288
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,132
It was an unfair match.

289
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,509
- You looked really pathetic.

290
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,259
- What do you want
me to do for you?

291
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,720
- I want you to make me proud.

292
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,935
- Come and get it!

293
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,646
- Gimme that, Nick.

294
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,994
- What's the matter, Kevin?

295
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,418
- It's really a long story.

296
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,541
- I've got all the
time in the world.

297
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,470
- What do you do about someone
who you can never make happy?

298
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,551
- Is this your girlfriend
we're talking about?

299
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,016
I don't know what to tell you.

300
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,222
What's the exact problem?

301
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:28,563
- Well, we've got this
friend who's in the army,

302
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,071
and my girlfriend's upset
because I couldn't do

303
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,493
all the things that he can.

304
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,073
- I see.

305
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,741
Did I ever tell you what I
did when I was in the army?

306
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,121
- No.

307
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,454
- Oh, it's also a long story.

308
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,754
(beeping)

309
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,377
Uh-oh.

310
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,302
Looks like we've got company.

311
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,972
(ominous music)

312
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,516
- Hey.

313
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,972
- Wait here, I'll call
you if I need you.

314
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,227
- But Mr. McCreedy--

315
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,523
- I said wait.

316
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:46,978
Oh!

317
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,058
- Shut up.

318
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,617
(intense music)

319
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,458
- Get away from him.

320
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,791
- Who's this, your grandson?

321
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,668
- No, he's my partner.

322
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,960
- I said, get away from him.

323
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,304
- Who are you kidding?

324
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,848
You don't know how to use that.

325
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,605
(gunshot)

326
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,852
(coughing)

327
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,185
- Are you okay?

328
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,145
Do you want me to
call an ambulance?

329
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,855
- No no, I'm fine.

330
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,440
- Damn.

331
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,695
- What's the matter?

332
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:38,901
- I just wish Amy
could've been here to see

333
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,406
what I just did.

334
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,115
- He's still on the lot.

335
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,540
- What do we do now?

336
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:46,958
- I'm going to call the police.

337
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,958
Try to locate where he is,
but keep a distance from him.

338
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,960
Don't try to be a hero.

339
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,513
(suspenseful music)

340
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,886
- Mr. McCreedy?

341
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,892
I'm going down that hallway
where all the machinery is.

342
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,564
I think he went down there.

343
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,392
I'm going in for a closer look.

344
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,411
- Good God, the vault!

345
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,242
Kevin!

346
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,919
Stop whatever you're doing!

347
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,088
Don't go near the vault
no matter what you do,

348
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,165
don't go near the vault!

349
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,515
- Amy, I wanna make you proud.

350
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,303
(growling)

351
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,396
- We're too late!

352
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,519
Kevin, why did you go in there?

353
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,771
Why didn't you listen to me?

354
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:19,834
- What's going on?

355
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,837
(exciting music)

356
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,438
(growling)

357
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,953
- Oh, if you only knew
what you just did.

358
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,664
- I don't understand!

359
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,499
What just happened?

360
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,586
- The vault, I
tried to warn you.

361
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,672
Those creatures,
the vault, I tried.

362
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,683
All my work, 30 years I've
been trying to prevent this

363
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,434
from happening.

364
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,891
- To prevent what
from happening?

365
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,521
- Those creatures.

366
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:27,357
Why do you think I spent the
last 30 years of my life here?

367
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,158
I was keeping them
from escaping.

368
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,993
I was young when I
began to work here,

369
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,371
and the studio was
busy and prosperous.

370
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,253
I'll always remember the
night that it happened.

371
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,927
It was late, there was
hardly anyone around.

372
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,715
I didn't even know
what it was at first.

373
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,222
It was all so fast,
just a flash of light

374
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,144
and then a sudden explosion.

375
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,851
I stepped out to
see what it was,

376
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,526
but there was no one
else there except for me.

377
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,862
It was right in the
middle of the lot.

378
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,694
Had it been daytime, it
probably would have been crushed

379
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,245
in all the traffic.

380
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,041
I just stared at
it for a long time.

381
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,961
I didn't know what
to make of it.

382
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,209
And then suddenly it moved.

383
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,713
And out from the top of the
disc came this small creature,

384
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,385
a sort of hobgoblin.

385
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:35,428
It looked around and then
it stared right at me.

386
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,475
I didn't move, I just
kept watching him.

387
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,691
Looked so friendly at first.

388
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,903
If only I'd known
what lay ahead.

389
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,073
- But I still don't understand.

390
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,908
- I let the creatures live
on the lot, it was my secret.

391
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,334
And then I learned of
the power they had.

392
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,081
I still don't know
if they figured

393
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:08,041
they were doing good
for people or not.

394
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:12,799
They slowly began to
destroy everyone on the lot.

395
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,597
They would find a person,
tap into his brain,

396
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,176
and then create his
wildest fantasy.

397
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,479
It seemed harmless at first,
I mean, watching everyone

398
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,775
around me becoming rich or
famous, but for most people

399
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,314
what they really want in
life can be very dangerous.

400
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,947
In fact, the creatures wound
up destroying everyone,

401
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,950
everyone they came
in contact with.

402
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,700
They're, they're, they're loose
in the city now.

403
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,830
- But you could warn everyone.

404
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,003
They'd listen to your story.

405
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,420
- Would they?

406
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,841
No one believed me 30 years ago.

407
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,259
I went straight to
the head of the studio

408
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,882
and tried to explain it to him.

409
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,212
He didn't believe
me, no one did.

410
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,346
I just watched helplessly
as people around me

411
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,678
were destroyed, one by one.

412
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,104
- Then what can we do?

413
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,064
- I'm too old to catch
up with them now,

414
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,441
but you might still
have a chance.

415
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:16,115
There aren't very many of
them, but they move quickly.

416
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,286
Just remember, they're
attracted to bright lights,

417
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,330
that's how you can fight them.

418
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,033
Watch everyone around you.

419
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,164
When a person begins
to act strangely,

420
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,916
it means that one
of the creatures

421
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,623
have tapped into his mind.

422
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,674
When this happens, the
creature is never far away.

423
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,048
Find it and kill it
before it's too late.

424
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,426
Because when the creature
dies, the fantasy ends

425
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,599
and the victim is safe.

426
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:46,101
Now remember, they're only
attracted to bright light.

427
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,056
That's how you find them.

428
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,983
But you must destroy
them all before dawn

429
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,186
because once it's
daylight, it's too late.

430
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,521
- Okay.

431
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,653
- You'll never be
able to stop them.

432
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,280
(ominous music)

433
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,874
(record scratch)

434
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,332
(dance music)

435
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,133
- Alright!

436
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,153
(growling)

437
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,373
Come on Amy, would
you get with it?

438
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,420
(growling)

439
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,805
(horn beeps)

440
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,183
That car horn, I'd
recognize it anywhere!

441
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,938
(horn beeps)

442
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,104
See you guys later.

443
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,488
Much later.

444
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,243
That's weird.

445
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,208
Maybe he's circling
the block or something.

446
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,870
- I brought your jacket.

447
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,580
I thought you might
be cold out here.

448
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,756
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

449
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,083
- Where's Nick?

450
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,885
I thought I heard
his horn before.

451
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:41,881
- So did I.

452
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,173
- Well maybe you should wait
inside until you see him.

453
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,054
- He's just looking
for a place to park,

454
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,760
now would you go
back in the house?

455
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,936
- There's plenty of parking
in front, maybe it wasn't

456
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,184
his horn?

457
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,685
- Look, I'm positive it was.

458
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,312
Maybe the police
just pulled him over

459
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,769
for all his warrants
or something.

460
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,102
Now would you just
go back in the house?

461
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,358
- Fine, I get the message.

462
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,782
- Just take this
stupid jacket with you.

463
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,782
Damnit Nick, where
the hell are you?

464
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,634
(growling)

465
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,465
Amy, would you just
go back in the house

466
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,142
and leave me alone?

467
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,605
And would you stop
breathing all over me?

468
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,057
(growls)

469
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,314
(screaming)

470
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,985
- Sounds like Nick
finally got here.

471
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,332
- Get the fuck off me!

472
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,296
- She must be happy to see him.

473
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,226
- Take that, you little bastard!

474
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,449
- Honestly, couldn't Nick wait?

475
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,874
(screaming)

476
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,626
(growling)

477
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,621
Go on, grab it!

478
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,537
- It's like a new dance.

479
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,877
Looks pretty kinky.

480
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,417
Hey guys!

481
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,093
- Nick, thank God you're here!

482
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,008
Something wild came out of the woods
and attacked us!

483
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,464
- I know I'm here to take ya out.

484
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,549
- Oh it's those rabid animals!

485
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,852
(screaming)

486
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,061
(growling)

487
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,088
I knew I'd find a use for this.

488
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,473
Just open the door
and stand back.

489
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,225
- Oh my God, what
do you call that?

490
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,730
- Urban renewal.

491
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,822
- Wait!

492
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,291
No, put that out!

493
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,963
(growling)

494
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,352
You guys okay?

495
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,429
- Yeah, I'm just peachy.

496
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,355
- I had everything
under control.

497
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,685
- Good, then you can
finish off your van.

498
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,827
- I don't understand,
what were those things?

499
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,412
- It's a long story.

500
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,293
What they do to your
body is nothing compared

501
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,090
to what they do to your mind.

502
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,338
- Don't have to
worry about that.

503
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,169
- You sure you're all okay?

504
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,221
I mean, you don't feel
anything different, do you?

505
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,424
- I think I wet my pants.

506
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,803
Hey, I was only kidding.

507
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,765
- And none of you have
a desire to do anything

508
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,396
you've never done before, right?

509
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,648
- I don't think
there's anything left

510
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,525
that we haven't done before.

511
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,322
- How 'bout you, Amy?

512
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,321
- Well actually I do
wanna try this new Chinese

513
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,119
restaurant that I heard about.

514
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:58,990
- Kyle?

515
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,535
- Could I use your
telephone again?

516
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,332
I wanna call my girlfriend.

517
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,410
- We still haven't met
this mystery girl of yours,

518
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,746
what kind of relationship
do the two of you have?

519
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,834
- I guess you'd say it's
a fantasy relationship.

520
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,940
(ominous music)

521
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,124
(growling)

522
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,314
(phone ringing)

523
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,391
- Hi, it's me, Fantasia.

524
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,818
Thanks for calling.

525
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,442
I need a new house pet
to impress my friends.

526
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,614
Now hurry before
the zookeeper comes,

527
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,614
help me hide this
iguana on my body.

528
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,071
Uh, can I help you, miss?

529
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:27,500
Oh yes Mr. Beastmaster,
something just crawled up my leg.

530
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,544
Oh, see if you can find it.

531
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,500
I think you'd better come
back to my office with me.

532
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,507
Now wait a minute, are
you sure your office

533
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,134
is in the baboon pit?

534
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,435
Mister zookeeper, what do
you think you're doing?

535
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,980
This isn't the
children's petting zoo.

536
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:53,276
I have a new house pet for
you, miss, ha ha ha ha ha.

537
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,439
Oh, mister zookeeper, I
could never take a cockatoo

538
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,318
that size.

539
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,443
(record scratch)

540
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,531
Now stop wasting your
money calling me.

541
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,036
I'm right outside your door.

542
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,953
Don't keep me waiting, lover.

543
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,788
(dial tone)

544
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,335
(suspenseful music)

545
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,741
(coyote howling)

546
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,246
- Where's Kyle?

547
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,801
Didn't you guys
see where he went?

548
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:04,801
- [All] No.

549
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,927
- Do you, do you
kiss on the first date?

550
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,639
- I go all the way
on the first date.

551
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,224
- My kind of woman.

552
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,685
My place or yours?

553
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,113
- Neither, we'll go
to Reputation Road.

554
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,698
- I'll drive.

555
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,775
Do we have some time to get
Pop Rocks and whipped cream?

556
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,568
- Just start the car.

557
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,981
- Reputation Road, here we come.

558
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,375
- Amy, quick, where's
Reputation Road?

559
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,623
Daphne, where's Reputation Road?

560
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,044
- You go down to the
end of the street,

561
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,792
make a right, go through
two traffic lights

562
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,625
and up the hill and there it is.

563
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,801
So I've heard.

564
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,128
- What's going on?

565
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,135
- I don't have time to explain,
it's about those creatures.

566
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,012
I've gotta go across
town and get Kyle.

567
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,513
I want the rest of
you to stay here.

568
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,014
Don't make a move
or do anything.

569
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,894
And above all, don't
fantasize about anything!

570
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,917
- You know, girls, I could
think of a fantasy right now.

571
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,542
It's involving the number three.

572
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,698
- Oh Fantasia, you're
my ideal woman.

573
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,617
You're intelligent, you've
got a wonderful personality,

574
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,286
and I'll bet you're a
great cook and I just know

575
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,534
my mom's gonna love meeting you.

576
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,706
Will you marry me?

577
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,753
- Skip the ceremony, we're
going straight to the honeymoon.

578
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:50,255
Oh Fantasia, baby I could
watch you all night long.

579
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,132
- If you don't go any
faster we could be driving

580
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,637
all night long.

581
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,311
Now hurry, I know a shortcut.

582
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,300
Oh, don't park here.

583
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,890
- Why not?

584
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,102
- You have to park near the edge

585
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,809
if you want to go all the way.

586
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,357
- Oh yeah, sure.

587
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:58,827
How's that?

588
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,708
- Perfect.

589
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,331
- That was some
shortcut you knew about.

590
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,502
I never knew there
was a road through

591
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,796
the children's playground.

592
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:09,087
- There isn't.

593
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,840
(laughs)

594
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,638
Well, what are you waiting for?

595
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,894
- Fantasia, where are you going?

596
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,855
- I wanted a better
view of the city.

597
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,238
You can see it all from here.

598
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,616
Now, isn't that a lovely view?

599
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,077
- Oh, it sure is.

600
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,501
Where are you going now?

601
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,502
- Just wait a second.

602
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,963
You just keep watching the view.

603
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:59,266
Just hold tight and get ready
for the ride of your life.

604
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,185
- Do it to me.

605
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,317
(groaning)

606
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,741
You need any help?

607
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,993
- Would you get back
inside and wait for me?

608
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,995
This time don't move!

609
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:30,880
We're almost there.

610
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,506
Just think nasty
thoughts while you wait.

611
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,923
(suspenseful music)

612
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,488
(groaning)

613
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,118
(growling)

614
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,145
- Do it do me, baby.

615
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,771
- You damn fool!

616
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,945
What are you doing here?

617
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,647
- I want you to
meet my girlfriend.

618
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:37,731
Wait 'til you see her.

619
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:38,862
Fantasia?

620
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:39,942
Honey?

621
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,026
- Kyle, there's no girl.

622
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,908
She was a figment
of your imagination.

623
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,955
- No she's not, she's
just hiding somewhere.

624
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,782
I told you, she's a shy girl.

625
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:47,832
Sweetie?

626
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,125
- Shy girl?

627
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,169
That bleached blonde
witch almost killed you!

628
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,795
She was back there trying to
push your car over the cliff!

629
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,091
Hey, come on!

630
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,632
(crashing)

631
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,056
(explosion)

632
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:18,192
- Whoa.

633
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,608
- Now do you believe me?

634
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,042
(ominous music)

635
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,309
I'll discuss my phone
bill with you later.

636
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,768
Oh no.

637
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,974
They're gone!

638
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:57,278
(growling)
(crying out)

639
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:10,995
Hit the creature!

640
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,452
- I'm trying to!

641
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,003
- Hit the creature!

642
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,104
Idiot.

643
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,652
The creatures broke
loose, are you guys okay?

644
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,858
- We're doing just fine.

645
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,819
- What about Amy, where's she?

646
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,745
- She was acting kinda strange.

647
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:49,993
- [Kevin] What?

648
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,323
Where is she?

649
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:52,033
- Well she said she
wanted to go to Club Scum.

650
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,288
- What?

651
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,835
Why didn't you try to stop her?

652
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,287
- What's the big deal?

653
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:57,621
I've been there before.

654
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,955
- You guys, don't
you understand?

655
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,166
These creatures have a power.

656
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,173
They can tap into your
brain and sense the things

657
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,721
that you really wanna do.

658
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,173
- What's wrong with that?

659
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,883
- They also try to kill you.

660
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,093
I just chased Kyle across town
and pulled him out of his car

661
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,850
right before it rolled
over a cliff and blew up.

662
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,226
- It's still burning now.

663
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,183
- You see what I'm trying
to tell you guys now?

664
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,144
- What could happen
at that nightclub?

665
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,319
- Well there's a lot of bikers

666
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,648
and people fighting everywhere,
and I've seen people

667
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,027
dealing drugs and knife fights.

668
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:25,983
- What?

669
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,485
Oh no, come on, we've gotta go.

670
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,576
Come on!

671
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:30,821
- And I've seen the police
arresting people there

672
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,656
all the time for god knows what!

673
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,284
- Oh no, come on!

674
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,870
(rock music)

675
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,731
Daphne, I think you
got this all wrong.

676
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,358
Amy would never come
to a place like this.

677
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,315
She won't even go through the
mall parking lot by herself.

678
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,317
- Would you just listen to me.

679
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,027
You guys have to have a
certain kind of attitude

680
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,487
when you're in
this part of town.

681
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,788
You've gotta look
like you belong, okay?

682
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,662
- Yeah, I get it.

683
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,202
- Look, would you just listen
to me and nothing will happen.

684
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,128
Now look, I think one of us
should hold all the wallets

685
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,047
for safe-keeping.

686
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:22,918
You.

687
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,462
Now quiet and just be cool.

688
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,511
- Nick, Kevin, Daphne?

689
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:38,351
Cool, cool.

690
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,406
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

691
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,834
Where do you guys
think you're going?

692
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,786
- We're looking
for a girl in here.

693
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,291
- You know, somehow I don't
think the girls in here

694
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,294
are gonna be your type, why
don't you try the Polo Lounge

695
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:05,750
up the street?

696
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,504
- You don't understand, we're
looking for a particular girl

697
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,585
here tonight.

698
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:10,257
- Oh.

699
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,394
Yo, Pixie.

700
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,846
Haul it over here.

701
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:25,523
- Yeah, what is it?

702
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,355
- You working here tonight?

703
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,906
- Pretty stupid question,

704
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,950
of course I'm
working here tonight.

705
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,620
- No, no, I mean are
you, you know, working?

706
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,081
- College boys.

707
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,287
Of course I'm
working here tonight.

708
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,839
What'd you boys have in mind?

709
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,293
Any of those fancy
moves in French?

710
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,798
- Read my lips.

711
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:55,098
We're looking for a friend
of ours who's in there.

712
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,895
- Does she look anything
like Pixie maybe?

713
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,391
- God, I hope not.

714
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:09,530
- That's the last time I
ever give you 1 0% of my tips!

715
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,196
- 1 0% of her what?

716
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,652
- Alright, that's it, you
guys, you're outta here,

717
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,077
get outta here!

718
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:17,662
Oh, Daphne.

719
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,333
I didn't see you back there.

720
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:23,960
- Hi!

721
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,500
Roadrash!

722
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,081
Long time no see.

723
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,004
- I was sorry to hear
about your boyfriend

724
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,551
coming back from the army.

725
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,552
You give me a call
next time he's on duty.

726
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:39,886
- Ixnay on the oggiesay, okay?

727
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:41,932
- What?

728
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,099
- Can we go in?

729
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,350
- Hey, you guys are
friends of Daphne's.

730
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,147
Go for it, knock yourselves out.

731
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,083
- Do you guys see her anywhere?

732
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,331
- Would you just sit down
before everyone starts

733
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,631
staring at us?

734
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:27,357
- Oh, you must be here for the
wet T-shirt contest tonight.

735
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,355
- Wet T-Shirt contest?

736
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,027
- Donkey mud wrestling?

737
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,112
- Donkey mud wrestling?

738
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,860
- Get lucky night?

739
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:35,736
- No.

740
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,450
- Oh, I'm sorry, the
donkey mud wrestlers

741
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,749
are supposed to use
the rear entrance.

742
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:47,832
Enjoy the show.

743
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,290
- Hey Daphne.

744
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:54,963
- Hi Daph.

745
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:58,672
- Sit down.

746
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,557
- How well do you
know those guys?

747
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,478
- It's just platonic.

748
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:06,805
- Oh really?

749
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,390
- Oh would you
just shut up, okay?

750
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,691
- Hey, you guys aren't
much of a help, you know.

751
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:11,814
We're supposed to
be looking for Amy.

752
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,315
- Well why don't you try
looking under the tables?

753
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,197
- Yeah, Daphne's an expert on
being under the tables here.

754
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,571
What color are the rugs, Daph?

755
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,621
- Same color as the carpet
burns on my knees, Nick.

756
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,420
(clears throat)

757
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,594
(feedback squealing)

758
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:47,722
- Greetings lowlifes,
and welcome to Club Scum.

759
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:52,568

stage, you idiot!

- Can I get you guys
something to drink here?

797
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:09,806
- Maybe later.

798
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,850
- There's a two
drink minimum here.

799
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,895
- Look, we're all
underage, okay.

800
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,314
- Roadrash, come here, quick.

801
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,270
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, what is it?

802
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:26,357
- None of these kids are 21 yet.

803
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,235
- Alright.

804
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,986
How many fake IDs we need here?

805
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,039
- This says I'm 40
and handicapped.

806
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,366
- So what?

807
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,247
You got a problem
with that, junior?

808
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,748
- No, I'll limp.

809
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,464
- And now, Club Scum is proud
to present a new headliner.

810
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:50,423
Appearing nudely and
nightly, Miss Amy Sincere.

811
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,304
(sexy music)

812
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:00,933
- Oh my God.

813
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,607
Amy, get off the stage!

814
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:11,033
- Hey, sit down and shut up.

815
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,955
(cheers and whistles)

816
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,752
- I don't know, but I think
it's sort of an improvement.

817
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:22,875
- So do I.

818
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:25,225
- I bet you showed her how
to do that, huh Daphne?

819
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,157
- Well, what do you think folks?

820
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:39,785
Is she a hit or a miss?

821
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,118
(cheering and whistling)

822
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,546
- Amy, you don't know
what you're doing!

823
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,047
Get off the stage!

824
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,921
Amy! Amy get off the stage!

825
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,894
- Stop interrupting the show!

826
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:49,526
- I want you to treat me like dirt.
Spill your drinks on me.

827
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:56,984
Show everyone that I'm
not wearing any underwear.

828
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:06,121
Take me under the
table and use me.

829
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:08,377
Make me.

830
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:13,382
Your woman.

831
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,887
- My bike's right outside.

832
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,715
I live right around the corner,

833
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,596
you know what I mean?

834
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,723
- Look, she's just drunk.

835
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,895
She doesn't even know
what she's saying.

836
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,189
She's never even been on
the back of a motorcycle,

837
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,267
she's terrified of them.

838
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:35,530
- Riding a motorcycle
is like sitting on

839
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,108
the world's largest vibrator.

840
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:56,005
- Miss Sincere,
you're my kinda woman.

841
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:58,928
- Amy Sincere's
only my stage name.

842
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,881
Do you wanna know my real name?

843
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,969
- Tell it to me on
your knees, baby.

844
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,724
- Break it up you two!

845
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,476
- Look, I'm not into
the number three.

846
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,933
Get outta here you jerk!

847
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:23,362
- Would you guys stop
sitting there and help me?

848
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:24,991
- Why don't you
help him, Daphne?

849
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,746
You seem to have a way with
all the men in this place.

850
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,244
Sergeant Parker, what
are you doing here?

851
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,584
- At ease, Private.

852
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,540
I'm out on a weekend pass.

853
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,126
I hear Pixie's working tonight.

854
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,711
- You go out in public
in full uniform?

855
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,921
- A real soldier dies
with his boots on.

856
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:43,882
- This way, this way!

857
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:45,179
(growling)

858
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,726
- What's going on here?

859
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,678
- Just a problem involving
some small predators, sir.

860
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,773
(growling)

861
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,396
- I see.

862
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,068
Sort of a marauding attack.

863
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:57,395
- Yes sir.

864
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,775
I believe that we need
to stage a diversion!

865
01:07:59,117 --> 01:07:59,947
- Private!

866
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,149
Who's in command here?

867
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,199
- You are, sir.

868
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,698
- Then I'll make the decisions.

869
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,575
We need to stage a diversion.

870
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,032
And I have just what you need.

871
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,578
(growling)

872
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,649
- The crowd here tonight.

873
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,942
(growling)

874
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:29,782
Pixie.

875
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,621
Did I ever tell you that
I was a talent scout

876
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,498
for a major motion
picture studio?

877
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,217
- Did I ever tell you that
I've always been attracted

878
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,215
to men of your stature?

879
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:50,099
- Oh, Pixie, Pixie, Pixie!

880
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:58,316
(giggling and moaning)

881
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:01,944
(screams)

882
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,700
- What the hell are you doing?

883
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,324
- Here.

884
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,788
- Kevin, Kevin, I
got one of them.

885
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,166
- Good, let's hope
it's the right one.

886
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:27,090
- Oh Roadrash, do it to me.

887
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:28,216
Oh!

888
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:33,184
- Kevin, quick,
you've gotta stop him.

889
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:38,648
- Alright, Daphne can stay
but I want you two outta here.

890
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,112
- Hey, you gotta
stop him, look!

891
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,739
(explosions)

892
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,379
(screaming)

893
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:12,806
- What's all that shouting?

894
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,806
- It's me faking
my orgasm for you.

895
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,734
(explosions)

896
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,456
- Wait a second.

897
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,084
(screaming)

898
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:59,015
- Wait, stop, come back!

899
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,603
(suspenseful music)

900
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,369
(growling)

901
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,617
(screaming)

902
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,930
- Can you still fake
your orgasms for me?

903
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:41,057
- Fake this!

904
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,523
- Hey look, there's Amy!

905
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,655
Amy, are you okay?

906
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:00,994
- I'm not sure.

907
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,121
Why am I dressed like
a rock video slut?

908
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:05,124
- It's a long story,
I'll explain later.

909
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:10,754
- You there.

910
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,881
Name, rank, serial number.

911
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,338
- Don't shoot me,
I'm just an employee.

912
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,220
I don't even book
the talent here.

913
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,183
- Sergeant, can't you stop him?

914
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,434
- Why?

915
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:25,890
This is the best
training he's ever had.

916
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,475
You could never get
this at boot camp.

917
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,151
- You call that training?

918
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,898
He could kill somebody.

919
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,071
- War isn't pretty.

920
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,364
- Daphne and Nick
are still inside,

921
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,488
we gotta try and help 'em.

922
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,035
- Wait.

923
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,283
I have a special
mission for you.

924
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,455
- You do?

925
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:42,451
- Yes.

926
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:46,285
Have you ever considered
joining the USO?

927
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:47,620
- The USO?

928
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:48,624
- Yes, think of it.

929
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,046
Entertain the
troops, doing your part

930
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,296
for our country.

931
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,377
A small but patriotic gesture
that would be appreciated

932
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:58,214
by our boys off fighting
around the world.

933
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,298
- I'll do it!

934
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:00,474
- Good!

935
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,301
You can start right away.

936
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,309
I've got a truckload of
soldiers out in the parking lot.

937
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,357
If you start now you can be
finished with them by morning.

938
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:09,228
- What?

939
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,402
Nick, do something, your
Sergeant's after me.

940
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,396
Just shoot him!

941
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,356
- One more time, babe.

942
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,487
Here, do it yourself.

943
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:18,817
- Stop wasting time.

944
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,448
- Nick!

945
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,405
- Maybe I should send Nick off
to some third world country.

946
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,741
That'll give you all
the time that you need.

947
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:26,371
- Let go of me!

948
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,497
- Or maybe I should get Nick
out of the picture altogether.

949
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,671
Nick, this is your
sergeant speaking!

950
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,168
Save the troops!

951
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,041
That's an order!

952
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,968
- Nick! No, don't do it!

953
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,553
(explosion)

954
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,181
(screaming)

955
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,741
- That truck of soldiers
is waiting outside.

956
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,165
It'll be a dream come true.

957
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,618
(growling)

958
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,044
- My dream can come
true right now.

959
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:20,133
(explosion)

960
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,141
I got the last of 'em.

961
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,614
(magical chimes)

962
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,131
- Must've been a
rowdy crowd tonight.

963
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,510
- Hey, hey, hey Miss Sincere.

964
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,808
You know I really liked that
show you were doing inside.

965
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,102
- Okay scumball, the show
is over, why don't you just

966
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,601
climb back under your rock?

967
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,978
- Daphne, I could've done that.

968
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,059
- Oh, sorry.

969
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:20,239
- Amy, I want you to know that
I'll always be there for you.

970
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,611
- Well you know, no one's
ever really noticed me

971
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,488
before like that.

972
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,571
I mean, I've always just been
thought of as Daphne's friend.

973
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,579
This is the first time somebody
came up to me like that.

974
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,080
I kinda liked it.

975
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,537
- Amy I meant what I said.

976
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,588
I'm gonna prove it to you.

977
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,398
- Where is he?

978
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,824
Mr. Comstock, I wasn't
sure if you'd still

979
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,375
be here this late.

980
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:14,667
- I'm on my way out the door.

981
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,370
What do you want now?

982
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:18,171
- The creatures
have broken loose.

983
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:19,589
The same ones I tried
to warn you about

984
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,667
when I first got my job here.

985
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:22,751
- Are you gonna try to
tell me that same story

986
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,463
about the hobgoblins again?

987
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:26,342
- Yes sir.

988
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,471
I'm glad you still
remember about them.

989
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,677
- How could I forget
that nonsense?

990
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,432
Now get outta here
and get back to work.

991
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:35,059
- But you don't understand.

992
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,983
They broke loose tonight,
they're out there

993
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,651
somewhere in the city!

994
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,695
I already sent the other
guard out to try to find them.

995
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:43,522
- What?

996
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,904
You mean there's no one manning
the front gate right now?

997
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:46,950
- No sir.

998
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,573
- This is preposterous.

999
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,575
You do know that if
something were to happen

1000
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,577
to this studio while
no one was on duty,

1001
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,034
our insurance will
refuse to pay off?

1002
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,334
- Yes sir.

1003
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,208
- Well then get
back on your post.

1004
01:17:58,549 --> 01:17:59,789
- You're not listening!

1005
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,544
I want to go out and find him.

1006
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,251
He must need my help by now!

1007
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,757
- You are not going to
leave your job to go out

1008
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,679
and chase some foolishness.

1009
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,975
If you walk off this
lot, you are fired.

1010
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:13,932
- Well good.

1011
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,981
Saves me the
trouble of quitting.

1012
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,674
- Mr. McCreedy?

1013
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:47,924
- Hey there.

1014
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,558
We have a score to settle.

1015
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,262
(intense music)

1016
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:07,527
- Amy, this time I'm
gonna make you proud.

1017
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,543
(punching)

1018
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,216
- Amy, I think Kevin's
proved his bravery to you,

1019
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,764
would you tell him to stop
before he kills himself?

1020
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,685
- For God's sake Kevin,
stop before he kills you!

1021
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:15,515
- Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

1022
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:24,562
- No!

1023
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,018
(gunshot)

1024
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,328
(screams)

1025
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,576
(magical chimes)

1026
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,415
- I'm sorry for sending
you out on your own.

1027
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,966
I should have known the
creatures would try to destroy

1028
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:49,837
you, also.

1029
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,878
- Where are they going now?

1030
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,713
- Back to their
home in the vault.

1031
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,924
Hurry, there isn't
much time left.

1032
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,224
- Kevin, wait.

1033
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,138
(sultry music)

1034
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:08,856
Don't take too long.

1035
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,233
I'll be waiting.

1036
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,028
- Let's go!

1037
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,222
(suspenseful music)

1038
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:49,814
- Do you think--

1039
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:50,769
- Shhh.

1040
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,362
I was right about them.

1041
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,196
They're back inside.

1042
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:04,408
- Well maybe we
should get closer

1043
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,664
and lock them back inside again.

1044
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,542
- No, I've spent 30
years guarding them,

1045
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,965
and I was fired
from my job tonight.

1046
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:14,509
I won't be around here
to keep an eye on them.

1047
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:15,927
- You were fired?

1048
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,424
Well, maybe I could
guard them from now on.

1049
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,969
- Oh no, I don't want you
to throw your life away

1050
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,645
the way I had to.

1051
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,478
There is a better way.

1052
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:33,444
- Did you find them?

1053
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,238
- Yeah, they're back
inside the vault.

1054
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:36,986
- What are you gonna do to them?

1055
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:38,533
- I don't know.

1056
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:39,906
- Kevin.

1057
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,989
Did I ever tell you
what I did in the war?

1058
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,163
- No.

1059
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:46,579
- Munitions.

1060
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,035
(beeping)

1061
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,291
(explosion)

1062
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,595
Isn't it ironic that they
should pick a movie studio

1063
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,142
to land?

1064
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,439
Unless they figured they
belonged in a dream factory.

1065
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,528
- You were my hero tonight.

1066
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,900

- Yeah, I'm sure.

1069
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,669

01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:32,746
- Yeah.

1071
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,251
- This is for you.

1072
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,046
- Really?

1073
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:41,630
No one's ever given
me flowers before.

1074
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,260
- Oh, but there's lots of
things I could show you

1075

01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:49,687
- Nick!

1079
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,265

01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,944
Told you guys I had
everything under control.

1081
01:23:58,951 --> 01:23:59,610
Daphne.

1082
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,196
- Nicky.

1083
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,448
- [Both] Van!

1084
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,213
- Hello, Mr. Comstock.

1085
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:22,137
Yes, I realize what time it is.

1086
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,432
I'm sorry to wake you, sir,
but there's been an accident

1087
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,724
at the studio.

Yes, I realize
about the insurance,

1091
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:39,028
but you fired me earlier.

1092
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:43,700
There was no one on
duty when it happened.

1093
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,533
- [Voiceover] What
are you talking about?

1094
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,283
What do you mean--

1095
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:50,199
