00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:19,742
Celebrating 60 Years of the Kadokawa Group

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,726
Is anyone here?

3
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:40,905
Dad...

4
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,636
Sis...

5
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,080
...don't go.

6
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,598
I had a nightmare.

7
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,546
Tokyo, where I was born, was in ruins.

8
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:27,646
Are you going to sleep all day?
You'll be late for school!

9
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,519
Tadashi, get up!

10
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,702
It had been six months since the divorce.

11
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:54,613
From the window of the room Grandpa built for me...

12
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,546
...the sea was calm.

13
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:10,287
That summer, I fell in love for the first time.

14
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,790
And...

15
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,934
...I told a little white lie.

16
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,269
What's that?!

17
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:06,496
Horror... horror...

18
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:13,037
There's a horrible war...

19
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:16,545
...coming!

20
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,255
The time has come... now is the time of revenge.

21
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,895
O ye things humanity has used and discarded...

22
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,434
O spirits persecuted...

23
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,071
O rage shut away...

24
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,075
...arise.

25
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,809
It's time to arise!

26
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,249
Arise.

27
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,497
Join with us.

28
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:48,296
Arise, O vengeful wraith...

29
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,201
...Yomotsumono!

30
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:09,975

38
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,448
Hey, Tadashi!

39
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:20,849
What are you scared of?

40
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,581
Uh... nothing.

41
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,755
Is the little city kid...

42
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,820
...scared of a spooky village festival?

43
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:32,434
Watch out the kirin doesn't bite you!

44
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:35,835
Why?

45
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,866
The one it bites is this year's 'Kirin Rider'.

46
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,647
'Kirin Rider'?

47
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,907
Don't you even know that?!

48
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:52,519
Guardian of Peace, Friend of Justice.

49
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,087
The wrestler Antonio Inoki got bit once.

50
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,420
It won't choose me.

51
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,313
The 'Kirin Rider'! Go for it, lad!

52
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:52,838
I'm home.

53
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,057
Grandpa, I'm home!

54
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:05,285
Grandpa!

55
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,756
Captain! Permission to board!

56
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,466
Akira?

57
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:17,206
Well done!

58
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:19,973
It's 'Tadashi'!

59
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:24,045
'Kirin Rider'?

60
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:24,975
Yeah.

61
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,709
The festival kirin chose me.

62
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:31,348
I'm the boy who preserves peace.

63
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:36,354
Sounds great. But what do you do that with?

64
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,355
All I won...

65
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:42,557
...was beans and rice, and a towel.

66
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,659
Still, that's great!

67
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,360
Grandpa must be happy.

68
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,934
I haven't told him.

69
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,007
Anyway, today I'm 'Akira'.

70
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,943
Oh... is he OK?

71
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:03,309
Yeah, he's fine.
Every third day I go back to being 'Tadashi'.

72
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,911
Every third day, huh?

73
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,648
I bet he's forgotten me.

74
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:13,221
Bless this food.

75
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:15,625
Good boy!

76
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,372
Tadashi?

77
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,908
I'm used to it. It's been six months.

78
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:45,420
Hey, it's almost summer vacation.

79
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:48,763
Dad says we might sneak down and see you.

80
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,965
He said that last spring.

81
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:54,696
Oh.

82
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,298
Yeah, he did.

83
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,974
I'll call again.

84
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:01,072
OK.

85
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:02,471
Tadashi...

86
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,605
Hang in there.

87
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,777
Yeah. See you.

88
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,100
I'm home.

89
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:27,661
Hi.

90
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,268
What's wrong?

91
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,210
Were they teasing you again?

92
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,940
No.

93
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,781
OK, then.

94
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:48,122
Pickles.

95
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:50,019
Thanks.

96
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,056
What's this?

97
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,487
Oh, that...

98
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:00,630
Oh, Dad!

99
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:03,469
Not that!

100
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,268
What?

101
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,839
That towel...

102
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:10,368
Azuki beans are good for you.

103
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:16,273
'Azuki beans are good for you.' by Grandpa

104
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:26,783
Quiet, please! Quiet!

105
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:32,093
Don't forget your summer homework.

106
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:35,259
And write those book reports.

107
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:39,225
A child who doesn't read makes a worthless adult.

108
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,069
And now, vacation!

109
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,672
See you later!

110
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:54,911
Rider!

111
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,247
When are you going for
the legendary sword?

112
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:58,410
What sword?

113
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,317
Didn't they even tell you that?

114
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,754
They know a feeb like you...

115
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,223
...can't handle it.

116
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,318
The Kirin Rider...

117
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,763
has to go to the cave on Great Goblin Mountain...

118
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,866
...to get the Great Goblin Sword.

119
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,259
No way...

120
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,133
...crybaby Tadashi can do that!

121
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:21,141
Cut it out.

122
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,707
What are you guys up to?!

123
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:26,943
Watch it!

124
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:28,008
Your Grandpa's here.

125
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:29,172
Again?

126
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:30,478
You be quiet!

127
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,621
Grandpa...

128
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:39,992
What?

129
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,120
Akira was Mom's elder brother?

130
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,857
Right.

131
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,437
But he died years and years ago.

132
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,873
My son and heir.

133
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,942
Always getting in fights, never good for anything.

134
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:04,852
Do I look like him, Grandpa?

135
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:10,955
you do.

136
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,825
You do, somehow.

137
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:23,666
Grandpa...

138
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,770
...do you know 'Great Goblin Mountain'?

139
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,307
Well, of course!

140
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:33,775
That be it there, over yonder.

141
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,347
Long, long ago, they say...

142
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:43,823
...there was an evil goblin
there who'd snatch children away.

143
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:51,157
And then he was felled...

144
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,527
...by the Kirin Rider!

145
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,799
'I'll never work evil again,'
the Great Goblin said.

146
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,405
He changed his ways,
and swore allegiance to the Kirin Rider.

147
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:07,049
So then the Kirin Rider...

148
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:12,885
...left the Great Goblin a sword to keep...

149
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:15,513
...and bade him be Guardian Spirit to this land.

150
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:21,222
Since then they say the one chosen Kirin Rider...

151
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:25,658
...must climb that mountain...

152
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:30,535
...and get the sword
that Great Goblin has in his keeping.

153
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,641
Will you go?

154
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,448
You were chosen Kirin Rider, weren't you?

155
00:16:47,056 --> 00:16:48,284
How did you know?

156
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,860
Hmm, how did I know?

157
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:58,997
What?

158
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:03,237
I didn't finish those beans!

159
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,141
They know a feeb like you...

160
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:11,145
They know a feeb like you can't handle it.

161
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,879
No way...

162
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,817
No way crybaby Tadashi can do that!

163
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:03,456
'Great Goblin's Cave...

164
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,527
'... left.'

165
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:29,313
No way!

166
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,031
Thank you!

167
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,429
Driver!

168
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,302
A cat?!

169
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:45,590
Do you understand me?

170
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:55,670
OK!

171
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,407
Here. Drink this.

172
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,711
NO?

173
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:09,284
You've got to have something
or you won't get better.

174
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:10,649
Kitty.

175
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,850
No?

176
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,057
Then what are you?

177
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:22,719
I can't find you in here.

178
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,239
What?

179
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:38,972
'Shin'?

180
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,647
Why are you rubbing my shin?

181
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:52,950
'Shin',
'Rub'... the sprite that rubs against your shins!

182
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:55,020
'Sunekosuri'!

183
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,860
Agi!

184
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:22,405
Let me out! I'm warning you!

185
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,702
Do you hear me?!

186
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:30,077
Agi!

187
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:48,899
Agi!

188
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,844
This isn't funny!

189
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,875
What do you want with us?!

190
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,174
You're one of us!

191
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:39,008
I'm not one of you any more.

192
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,681
I will unite with Lord Kato...

193
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,325
...and be reborn.

194
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,566
You'll what?!

195
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,702
I can't wait, Agi.

196
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:16,121
Ow...! Let me go!

197
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:16,951
Stop it, I tell you!

198
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,680
Stop playing games!

199
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,791
Agi, what are you doing?!

200
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,690
Stop it!

201
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,264
No!

202
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,831
No! Don't!

203
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,981
Release your rage...

204
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,087
...and bury humankind in darkness.

205
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,775
Yoichi!

206
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,475
You haven't brushed your teeth!

207
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,683
This won't do.

208
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,384
That boy...

209
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,497
The Kirin Rider

210
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,815
Where should we go?

211
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,324
Sunekosuri

212
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:35,292
...why can only I see you?

213
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:39,239
Why not anyone else?

214
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:43,443
Are you a yokai?

215
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:55,548
Mizuki Shigeru

216
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:59,081
One of Japan's best-known comic artists...

217
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:05,889
...Mizuki Shigeru was born in
1922 here in Sakaiminato.

218
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,629
The yokai spirits in his work
are based on Japanese folklore...

219
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:14,167
I knew it!

220
00:28:15,243 --> 00:28:16,710
You're...

221
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:19,171
...a yokai!

222
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,678
But this is where it all started!
And I've come all this way!

223
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:25,083
Give me a few days.

224
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:28,451
Tell the Editor that.

225
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,557
I'll come back later.

226
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:41,435
Aren't you...

227
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,696
...the Kirin Rider?

228
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,378
Amazing!

229
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:58,542
I'm doing research on the kirin dance.

230
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:02,018
I still have to go to Aoya.

231
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,016
You must like yokai.

232
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,551
Like them?

233
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,824
Yeah.

234
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,193
Why?

235
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:16,365
Why?

236
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,003
Why?

237
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,570
Don't laugh.

238
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,808
OK.

239
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:33,851
When I was a kid, just once...

240
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,389
...I saw a real one.

241
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:08,448
Was that the only time?

242
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,758
Uh, yeah.

243
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,256
Just the once.

244
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:15,285
Now I probably can't.

245
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,488
Why not?

246
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:18,931
Maybe...

247
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:21,632
...I grew up.

248
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,632
You don't see them after you grow up?

249
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,005
Maybe not.

250
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,811
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm coming...

251
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:39,980
Hello, Chief?

252
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,852
Sorry about this.

253
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:50,855
What?

254
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:53,556
The project's on hold?! things happen!

255
00:30:53,735 --> 00:30:56,863
You know what publishing's like.

256
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,532
The company's changed plans.

257
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,271
Would I write about goblins...

258
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:05,073
...if I was scared of the company?!

259
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,718
I've got to go back to Tokyo.

260
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:12,953
Bye!

261
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:33,216
'I'll be at the Great Goblin's Cave. Grandpa.'

262
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:36,859
Why?

263
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,827
Help!

264
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,030
Something's got me by the feet!

265
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,037
Help!

266
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,835
Grandpa!

267
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,812
Grandpa!

268
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,560
Grandpa?

269
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,407
Grandpa!

270
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,686
Grandpa?

271
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,059
Grandpa!

272
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:08,874
Oh, no!

273
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,720
Sunekosuri!

274
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,459
Sunekosuri!

275
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,728
Where are you?

276
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,299
Sunekosuri!

277
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,808
Sunekosuri!
Where are you?

278
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,076
Where are you?

279
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,109
Sunekosuri!

280
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,987
Sunekosuri!

281
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,505
Tadashi...

282
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,212
What are you doing here?

283
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,878
Sis?

284
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:25,729
But... why are you here?

285
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:31,423
'Sis', you called me?

286
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,731
Sis!

287
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,438
Sis!

288
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:55,452
Does your sister...
...Iook like this?

289
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,144
Help me!

290
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,387
I'm sorry...

291
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,926
I'd like to help you...

292
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,188
but...

293
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,968
I'm a bit...

294
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,781
How?!

295
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,387
How do you do that?!

296
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,490
I'm sorry.

297
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,878
Keep away!

298
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,508
Help!

299
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:34,877
No!

300
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:49,331
Tadashi! Help me!

301
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,871
Tadashi! I can't breathe!

302
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,542
Tadashi!

303
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,908
I can't breathe!

304
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,752
Tadashi! Help me!

305
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,952
No! I can't!

306
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,465
I'm dying!

307
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,001
Grandpa!

308
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,312
You passed.

309
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,629
You did great.

310
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:41,251
You did great.

311
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,895
A river-sprite! A 'kappa'!

312
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:29,838
Sunekosuri!

313
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:33,305
Hey! That's discrimination!

314
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:37,209
The kappa talked!

315
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:38,308
Don't point!

316
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:40,249
I'm glad you're safe.

317
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:46,460
Go away!

318
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,593
Who are they?!

319
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:57,294
ey, stupid! Don't go judging on appearances!

320
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:01,764
That cute little Sunekosuri...

321
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:06,269
...and this pretty River
Princess are yokai just like us!

322
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:10,247
As far as I'm concerned, you're pretty ugly, too!

323
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:16,054
I can make cute noises. Cuddle me, too!

324
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:22,257
Cuddle me, too!

325
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:24,431
Kawataro!
Stop it.

326
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:26,429
But that kid...

327
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,695
But you did fine.

328
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:32,171
You're the Kirin Rider, for sure.

329
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:34,803
Sorry!

330
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:36,442
We were just testing you...

331
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:40,277
...to see if you had what it take
to draw the sword.

332
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:41,742
The sword?!

333
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:43,711
Remember me?

334
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,488
It is 'Shrine Festival'...

335
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:52,253
Yes, leading the Kirin.

336
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,055
But this isn't a mask now.

337
00:41:56,697 --> 00:41:57,891
Grandpa!

338
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,830
I've got to save Grandpa!

339
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:12,308
Tadashi! Help me!

340
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:35,195
We didn't think you'd come if I didn't do that.

341
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:40,000
Anyway, shall we go visit the Great Goblin?

342
00:42:40,774 --> 00:42:42,742
No!

343
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:46,040
Oh? Can you get home alone?

344
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:47,774
Not all the yokai...

345
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,612
...are nice guys like us, you know.

346
00:42:49,683 --> 00:42:53,380
Hell may lie ahead, but worse lies behind!

347
00:43:03,297 --> 00:43:05,424
I'm Kawahime, the River Princess.

348
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:07,629
Come on.

349
00:43:08,035 --> 00:43:08,831
Let's go!

350
00:43:23,217 --> 00:43:25,811
Nothing but small fry left here.

351
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:42,063
Help me!

352
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:45,434
The Great Goblin...

353
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:34,251
Every kid dreams about a summer adventure!

354
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,540
I'll never make it!

355
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:08,044
You know, kid, what usually happens now is...

356
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:10,452
...everyone goes 'you can do it! '

357
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:12,823
...as you struggle across.

358
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,220
Then the rotten board breaks. 'Aaarrghhh! '...

359
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:20,060
...and you're saved in the nick of time!

360
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,135
So don't go causing us the trouble.

361
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,466
Dangerous, huh?

362
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:03,203
Be careful.

363
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:08,638
Hey, kid!

364
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,113
Now, what happens here...

365
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:16,052
A huge great rock
comes rolling down from above...

366
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:22,992
See?

367
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:38,111
And you run like this!

368
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:05,766
Kawataro!

369
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:16,611
He's squashed!

370
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:27,050
He's squashed!

371
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:48,660
Tadashi?

372
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,132
Tadashi?

373
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,220
A sandal?

374
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,680
You have done well.

375
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:46,822
Who draws this sword becomes...

376
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:49,554
...the true Kirin Rider...

377
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,724
...and guardian of peace in the land.

378
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,696
Draw it.

379
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,967
It's painful!

380
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,472
Draw it.

381
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,363
I can't. I'm too scared!

382
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,151
What's that?!

383
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:23,386
Found you!

384
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,924
Of all the nerve!

385
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:49,705
Wow!

386
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,081
I want that power.

387
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:21,105
Your Greatness!

388
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:55,568
Sunekosuri!

389
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:22,066
Tadashi!

390
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,418
Princess! No!

391
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,630
Sunekosuri!

392
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,362
Suffer.

393
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,268
Hate us. Curse us.

394
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,578
That gives us strength.

395
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:49,049
Agi...

396
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:02,860
Kato Yasunori!

397
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,494
Who's he?

398
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:13,441
Come back.

399
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,303
We begin.

400
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:23,049
Now you and I will finally be one?

401
00:55:42,406 --> 00:55:44,374
Sunekosuri!

402
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,180
You're awake at last?

403
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:42,848
You are...

404
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,916
Hey!

405
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,786
Lamp-Oil!

406
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:14,145
Your head's too big!
Make it smaller!

407
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:21,729
OK!

408
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,040
Lamp-Oil

409
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:46,918
Hello, everybody!

410
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:51,619
Hello!

411
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:12,005
Not much of a Kirin Rider...

412
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:22,517
I know!

413
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,856
One-Leg the Smith!

414
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,824
He might know what to do!

415
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,198
Eh, General?

416
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:35,136
He's a fine swordsmith.

417
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:37,901
I see... we reforge the sword.

418
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:41,178
Yes, One-Leg the Smith...

419
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:42,770
Where is he?

420
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:49,311
Mirror!

421
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:53,288
Show us One-Leg the Smith!

422
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,093
What's that?

423
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:12,003
Mirror, show us where he is!

424
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:27,420
Sunekosuri!

425
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,955
What's that?!

426
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,534
It's her!

427
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,335
What's going on?!

428
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:49,042
That horrible flame!

429
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,470
No mistake...

430
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,042
...that's Yomotsumono!

431
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,550
'Yomotsumono'?

432
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:57,952
Yes.

433
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:03,290
The accumulated wrath
of resentful things...

434
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,490
...humanity has used
and thrown away...

435
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:10,465
...the raging spirit Yomotsumono!

436
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,624
What?

437
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,508
He is the resentment
humanity has earned...

438
01:01:20,577 --> 01:01:26,607
...from those things you use no more...

439
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,382
...and throw away

440
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:34,414
You...

441
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:38,826
...threw away your worn-out shoes.

442
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:47,595
They gave themselves for your feet...

443
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:51,004
...because they were 'dirty' or 'too small'...

444
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:54,837
...and you threw them out.

445
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:57,139
People just throw things away!

446
01:01:57,247 --> 01:02:00,648
That creates Yomotsumono.

447
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:14,789
Kato Yasunori!

448
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,153
O effigy...

449
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,715
...so cruelly used...

450
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:45,217
and cruelly abandoned.

451
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:53,800
Be reborn in the demon realm,
and take vengeance...

452
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:56,767
...with me.

453
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:26,262
Fool!

454
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:29,904
Kato!

455
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,833
He's brought Yomotsumono
back to life!

456
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,008
He wants only one thing.

457
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,606
What?

458
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:41,976
Revenge.

459
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:48,957
He wants to bury humanity in darkness!

460
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,322
So he's turning yokai into monsters!

461
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,728
He won't get away with it!

462
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:00,365
Who does this Kato?

463
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,097
Don't be afraid!

464
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:09,071
That's enough!

465
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:26,656
Meeting adjourned.

466
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:33,596
Hey, wait a minute!
Help us!

467
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,536
Wait...
You called me?

468
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:37,731
For what?!

469
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:43,038
We all join together
to beat Kato and Yomotsumono!

470
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,140
How?

471
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,448
I'm an umbrella.

472
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,721
Huh, Wall?

473
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:18,571
I'm only a wall...
I know that!

474
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,313
But even a wall...

475
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:22,851
...can be of some use!

476
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,547
Well, maybe next time.

477
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:30,454
I know you've got a job to do
and I sympathize, but...

478
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:36,161
Well, everyone, let's go.

479
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,493
Bye.

480
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,201
Hey, all of you!

481
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,670
Wait a minute!

482
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:54,311
My foot's asleep!

483
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:56,443
Wasn't that something!

484
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,955
I'm very happy!

485
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,254
Hey! You said you'd help!

486
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,850
I've already stuck my neck out once!

487
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:07,693
Snow Woman!

488
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:14,530
I'd help if it was winter,
but this really isn't my season.

489
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:20,338
At least you're one who won't get away!

490
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:29,045
You're always real brave...

491
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,780
...with Kitaro in those comics!

492
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,684
Bunch of wimps!

493
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:50,235
Azuki-Washer!

494
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,912
Will you stay?!
Huh?

495
01:06:58,615 --> 01:06:59,912
It's just that my foot's...

496
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,243
Thank you!

497
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:05,613
You're the conscience of us all!

498
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,454
I just...

499
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,460
I know. You just wash beans.

500
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,496
But that's fine!
