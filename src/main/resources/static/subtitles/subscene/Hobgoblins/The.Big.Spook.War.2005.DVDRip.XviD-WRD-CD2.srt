1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,066
Just knowing you're with us!

2
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:11,508
Won't you?

3
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:18,519
I'll wash my beans as best I can.

4
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:27,594
It's no good. We can't fight like this.

5
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:29,465
We can't win.

6
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:49,749
I'll go.

7
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,058
To save Sunekosuri.

8
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:15,173
Now you're looking good!

9
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:17,911
I'll be with you, beating my chest!

10
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:22,083
You, too!

11
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,091
Sorry.

12
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:31,354
Don't get carried away.

13
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:38,303
What's wrong?

14
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,889
He's taken flight!

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,825
Where to?

16
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:09,862
To the city of rage!

17
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:11,797
Tokyo?

18
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:15,569
Sis!

19
00:02:35,262 --> 00:02:38,925
Who is 'Kato Yasunori'?

20
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,365
He was human.

21
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,537
The rage...

22
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,999
...of the tribes...

23
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,804
yours destroyed made him a demon.

24
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:55,672
What tribes?

25
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:59,543
I don't understand.

26
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:05,147
You...

27
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:10,623
...poor thing...

28
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:13,157
You humans live in ignorance, don't you.

29
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:24,738
Those who discard their past have no future.

30
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,397
Well?

31
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:49,629
The teacher hasn't seen him,

32
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:51,568
I left word at Kikue's.

33
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:55,066
I hope he's all right!

34
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,111
Can't find him

35
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:03,812
He's not down by the port!

36
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,512
And that's not all.

37
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:12,316
There's monsters all over the place!
The town's in an uproar!

38
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:13,360
Monsters?!

39
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:18,688
These aren't rotten yet. I can still eat them.

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,704
Governor!

41
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:39,649
Hey, it's only Gamera.

42
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:54,657
We interrupt this program with a news bulletin.

43
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,396
Big news! Osaka Castle has been...

44
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,962
This is too slow!

45
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:32,667
We'll never catch him!

46
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:36,808
I know!

47
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:05,934
What is this?!

48
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,108
Argh! The dish on my head hurts!

49
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:20,449
(Don't try this at home, kids!)

50
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,954
This won't work!

51
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:29,056
This isn't funny!

52
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,898
Who is next?

53
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,245
Thank you.

54
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:02,594
I'm One-Leg the Smith...
Swordsmith to the Sprites.

55
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:16,932
What?

56
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:22,578
Hurry up, go back to your home...

57
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:26,119
Ignore it! Hurry up!

58
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,016
There's a time to drink!

59
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:37,463
Nothing will leave after the world is engulfed!

60
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:40,100
Drink a little more

61
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,401
But you amazed me. A real surprise.

62
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:46,167
I didn't think you'd go that far.

63
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,639
The President was impressed!

64
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,109
Moved to tears!

65
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:54,047
Chief I need more from you than tears!

66
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,878
At least we know the project won't be canceled,
for now.

67
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,418
It's that 'for now' I don't like.

68
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:01,949
What's up with that? I don't get it.

69
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:03,150
What do you mean?

70
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,848
What? What's that mean?

71
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,156
You don't know that

72
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:07,783
What's that mean?

73
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,591
Can you tell me what's that mean?

74
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,321
You can't say that

75
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:12,822
Why not?

76
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:16,562
Yokai, schmokai!

77
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:21,140
Soon they'll understand. There'll be a boom...

78
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:26,808
What was that?
Something sure went 'boom' there!

79
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,450
What's that?!

80
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:37,187
Look at the size of that thing! What's that?

81
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:44,322
My food...

82
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:44,311
It'll suck up all Tokyo's rage and resentment!

83
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:47,119
What power!

84
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:51,824
Chief!

85
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,232
Let's start with you.

86
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,866
No! Please don't!

87
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,237
You're ugly!

88
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:11,271
I'll keep my promise!

89
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,672
Forgive me!

90
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:18,606
You won't get away!

91
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,628
I'll make you really ugly.

92
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:07,892
It's huge!

93
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,100
Look!

94
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:45,030
Um... did you see Sunekosuri?

95
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,033
Mr. One-Leg did you see Sunekosuri?

96
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,673
Where is Sunekosuri?

97
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:57,905
He is not here.

98
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:02,904
Oh, no!

99
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,377
He's fine.

100
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:12,250
He's making everyone feel better.

101
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:25,603
Damn!

102
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:29,699
The fire's making my eyes water!

103
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:35,875
What's this?

104
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:38,050
New clothes.

105
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,145
You have to look the part!

106
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:51,297
Have you heard?

107
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:57,299
There's something big happening in Tokyo!

108
00:14:59,673 --> 00:15:00,662
Aye.

109
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:08,913
Something bigger than Tokyo Dome ate City Hall...

110
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,344
...and all the lights went out.

111
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,317
Shall we go have a look?

112
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,957
Old Edo... it's been years!

113
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:24,759
Have you heard?

114
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:32,332
They're raising the roof up in Tokyo!

115
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:38,703
The Tokyo Dome ate the City Hall!

116
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,646
And all the power!

117
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:44,775
The place is dark, dark, dark!

118
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:53,659
The place is dark!

119
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,455
Great! Great!

120
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:58,121
Did you hear? A Festival of Darkness in Tokyo!

121
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:00,530
We have to go!

122
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:06,467
Yes, I heard!
That Governor sure has some great ideas!

123
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:09,701
Party! There is a party in Tokyo!

124
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:12,434
A big festival!

125
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,579
Have you heard? Everybody's going!

126
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:26,859
The biggest festival there ever was in all Japan!

127
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,657
Right! Let's go!

128
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,828
A festival!

129
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,499
A festival!

130
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,861
The biggest in Asia!

131
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:43,674
What are you talking about? Tell me

132
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:45,644
This sounds interesting...

133
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,905
Isn't this a bit much?

134
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:09,665
How do you feel?

135
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:19,468
(Kirin Rider)

136
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:39,032
Tie this up

137
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:45,263
Now you won't drop it again.

138
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:29,014
Tadashi?!

139
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,283
There's too many of them!

140
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:38,745
Great!

141
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:58,062
Great!

142
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:12,585
Princess!

143
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,855
Oh, no!

144
00:20:47,187 --> 00:20:49,781
You monsters! You broke my dish!

145
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:12,940
319 short!

146
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,112
Not enough!

147
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,558
There's too many!

148
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:30,821
Dangerous!

149
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,289
This won't do!

150
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,151
Look!

151
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,703
What?

152
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,938
What? They've started already!

153
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:51,338
It's a circle, like the Lantern Festival!

154
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:04,045
You all came!

155
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:06,318
What a great festival!

156
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:10,055
Huh? A festival?

157
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:21,867
A fight! A fight!

158
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:24,768
A festival fight!

159
00:24:05,118 --> 00:24:08,110
My 'Tofu'!

160
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,315
It hurts me?!

161
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:08,303
It hurts me!

162
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,540
A fine festival!

163
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,349
Kirin Rider! Now's your chance!

164
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,248
Go inside!

165
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,861
What just stepped on me?!

166
00:26:05,638 --> 00:26:06,662
Tadashi!

167
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,733
What the...?!

168
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,569
Whose is this?

169
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,318
Ah, that's good!

170
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,286
What?

171
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:56,945
I see you!

172
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,388
Wow!

173
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:06,094
A great yokai war!

174
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:12,966
Tadashi!

175
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:49,166
Look at its leg!

176
00:28:01,387 --> 00:28:02,945
Sunekosuri?

177
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:06,918
Sunekosuri?

178
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:09,026
Is that you?

179
00:28:32,518 --> 00:28:33,951
Sunekosuri

180
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:50,565
No, Sunekosuri!

181
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,162
Don't!

182
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,339
No, Sunekosuri!
Don't!

183
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:09,078
No, Sunekosuri!

184
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:31,035
Don't!

185
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:33,778
No, Sunekosuri!

186
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,651
Sunekosuri! Stop!

187
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,462
Stop!

188
00:29:58,137 --> 00:29:59,695
Sunekosuri! Stop!

189
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:03,635
I'm sorry.

190
00:31:53,252 --> 00:31:57,882
I'm sorry.

191
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:06,628
I can't forgive you!

192
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:13,596
He won't...

193
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,936
...get away with this!

194
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:22,475
Kato...

195
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,409
...goes down!

196
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:43,958
Oh no you don't.

197
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:04,022
Do you know...

198
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,526
...after all the time
I've spent on Lord Kato...

199
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:18,232
...I'm not letting you get in my way!

200
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:33,949
Agi...

201
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,488
Lord Kato!

202
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:00,368
Put Tomio down!

203
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:11,315
But why don't they come here?

204
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,775
Tadashi! Where are you?

205
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,078
There!

206
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:48,048
Here... 314!

207
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:53,565
Only five left!

208
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,407
Kato!

209
00:35:54,593 --> 00:35:56,060
You were...

210
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:59,989
that effigy...

211
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:01,855
Stop this!

212
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:04,467
Please!

213
00:36:05,604 --> 00:36:06,696
Stop it!

214
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:14,675
How has it been,
wandering this world as a yokai?

215
00:36:16,115 --> 00:36:17,412
I hate it!

216
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:19,211
Hate what?

217
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:23,913
People!

218
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:26,654
How much?

219
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,926
More than you can say?

220
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:41,162
hen take revenge.

221
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,229
No!

222
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:43,772
Why not?

223
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:50,437
That only proves...

224
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:53,507
you're human.

225
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,459
Revenge is only proof that...

226
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:07,764
...you are human?

227
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:13,862
I won't defile myself!

228
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:21,178
That's why I save people, and love them.

229
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:27,544
That's why I can't forgive you!

230
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,417
Then...

231
00:37:36,362 --> 00:37:37,693
...be at peace.

232
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,807
There!

233
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:55,675
One more to go!

234
00:37:59,184 --> 00:38:01,015
There it is!

235
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:04,380
Found it!

236
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:10,157
I've got them all!

237
00:38:37,156 --> 00:38:38,282
Tadashi!

238
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:43,826
You...

239
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:49,492
Do you think you'll defeat me
with a thing like that?

240
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:56,800
Fool!

241
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:20,696
Agi...

242
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:24,402
...let's go.

243
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:10,647
Why?!

244
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,942
You're in the way.

245
00:40:19,057 --> 00:40:20,354
How?

246
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:25,653
The love you have for me.

247
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:30,963
That love is a hindrance.

248
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,572
Do you hate me?

249
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,919
Does your heart pain you?

250
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:54,449
Then my work...

251
00:40:57,062 --> 00:40:58,324
...is complete.

252
00:41:30,462 --> 00:41:31,759
I see her!

253
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:35,166
I've found her!

254
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:40,838
Hi!

255
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:26,145
(Azuki beans, I love 'em... )

256
00:42:26,485 --> 00:42:29,943
(Azuki beans, I love 'em... )

257
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,446
A bean...

258
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:34,291
Azuki beans...

259
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,862
...are good for you.

260
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:39,961
What?!

261
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:47,164
(Azuki beans grow from love and peace... )

262
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,870
What?!

263
00:42:56,181 --> 00:43:02,086
(Azuki beans, I love 'em... )

264
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,245
(I love Azuki beans!)

265
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,032
What the hell?!

266
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:43,014
This is great!

267
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:54,996
Here it comes!

268
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:04,928
Sensei... this night is over.

269
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:11,566
Rejoice! It would seem we have won the war.

270
00:46:12,043 --> 00:46:14,204
Won the war?

271
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:18,341
Don't be a fool!

272
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:33,757
There is a limit even to foolishness.

273
00:46:36,868 --> 00:46:42,033
Wars must not happen.
They only make you hungry.

274
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:53,851
Wars sure make you hungry!

275
00:47:16,574 --> 00:47:18,633
It wasn't a dream!

276
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:31,921
What?

277
00:47:33,992 --> 00:47:36,119
I forgot to call home.

278
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:43,599
Your mom's probably worried.

279
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:49,200
I've never done this.

280
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:56,407
Stayed out all night without calling.

281
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,363
Well...

282
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,999
you're on vacation.

283
00:48:33,084 --> 00:48:34,517
That girl...

284
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,518
Do you know her name?

285
00:48:46,564 --> 00:48:47,895
Yeah. Kawahime.

286
00:48:49,234 --> 00:48:51,099
'Kawahime'

287
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,964
That's a nice name.

288
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:06,712
Did she...

289
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:13,780
Did she say anything...

290
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:17,052
...about me?

291
00:49:41,286 --> 00:49:42,548
She's always...

292
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,450
...wanted to see you.

293
00:49:51,729 --> 00:49:53,697
She was glad...

294
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,060
...she finally did.

295
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:08,306
Yeah?

296
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:16,277
She was?

297
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,760
Ah, that's good!

298
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,630
Real good!

299
00:50:34,706 --> 00:50:38,164
For the first time in my life...

300
00:50:38,776 --> 00:50:40,607
...I told a white lie.

301
00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:46,578
A 'red lie' is one you tell for your own sake.

302
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:52,718
A 'white lie' is one you tell for someone else's.

303
00:50:55,326 --> 00:50:59,285
That seems to be the gateway to adulthood.

304
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:55,812
Tadashi!

305
00:51:57,188 --> 00:51:58,018
Yeah?

306
00:51:58,823 --> 00:52:02,554
Take out the garbage. I'll leave it here.

307
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,156
I won't need dinner tonight.

308
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:12,168
It's Mr. Yamada's farewell party.

309
00:52:12,737 --> 00:52:13,761
All right.

310
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:16,799
I'm off, then.
