1
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Women on the Verge
of a Nervous Breakdown

2
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,920
Ivan and I moved here
a few months ago.

3
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,200
The world was falling apart...

4
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,920
...and I wanted to save it
and save myself.

5
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,040
I felt like Noah.

6
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,880
In the coop on my terrace...

7
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,160
...I wanted to save
a couple of each species.

8
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,920
Anyway...

9
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,080
...I couldn't save
the couple I cared about most:

10
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
Ivan and me.

11
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
Pepa, darling...

12
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,880
...I never want to hear you say,
"I'm unhappy."

13
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Yours, Ivan.

14
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,560
Life means nothing without you.

15
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Will you marry me?

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A million nights
wouldn't be enough.

17
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,920
I can't live without you.

18
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,840
I love you,
desire you, need you.

19
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,200
That night in the jungle
was heaven.

20
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,160
Let's get married again.

21
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,280
You're the geisha of my life.
Sayonara.

22
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,600
With you by my side,
I don't need success.

23
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm willing
to accept you as you are.

24
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,920
Baby, some things
are unmistakably American.

25
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,920
I'm all yours.

26
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,560
- I accept you as you are.
- Great.

27
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,920
How many men
have you had to forget?

28
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
Say something nice.

29
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,120
Lie.

30
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,520
Tell me you've been
waiting for me...

31
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,440
...and you'd die
if I didn't return.

32
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,160
Say you still love me
as I love you.

33
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,440
Thanks.

34
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,560
Thanks a lot.

35
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,320
Call these two numbers.

36
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,160
First, I'll call one...

37
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,240
...then the other.

38
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,560
Pepa.

39
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,920
Pepa, sweetheart,
did you oversleep?

40
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,040
We started without you.

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Listen. Pack all my stuff
in a suitcase.

42
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

43
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,480
I'll come and pick it up
and say goodbye...

44
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,400
...but I'll call you before.

45
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,600
If you don't want to see me,
just leave it downstairs.

46
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
Thanks for being so understanding.

47
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,880
I don't deserve it.

48
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,520
I'll call later, darling.

49
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,880
Ivan?

50
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
"EXA." Hello.

51
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,440
Is Ivan there?

52
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,880
He just called me.

53
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,120
Sorry. He just left.

54
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,600
But your director is here
having a fit because you're not here.

55
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,640
Yes. Here he is.

56
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,240
I'm sorry, German.

57
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,920
I couldn't sleep,
so I took a pill.

58
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,480
Don't worry. Just come now.

59
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,040
I'll be right there.

60
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,080
I have to stop by
for some test results on my way.

61
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,480
Okay, but make it quick.

62
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,960
Some people are lucky.
I'll call your cab now.

63
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,280
Who wanted a taxi?

64
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,440
Whoever asked for a taxi,
come to the front desk.

65
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,360
Don't smoke...

66
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,120
...eat properly,
and you'll be fine.

67
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,320
Mr. Salcedo,
please pick up the telephone.

68
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,960
It's about time. Studio seven.

69
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,360
Did Ivan call again?

70
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,760
No. Forget him, honey.

71
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm working on it.

72
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,320
Just give me time.

73
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,080
And cut the microphone.

74
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Give me that paper!
Give me that!

75
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,160
- I'm really sorry, guys.
- Okay, let's go.

76
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,920
Arturo, do you take...

77
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,520
...Eugenia as your wife...

78
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,360
...and promise to be faithful,
for richer or for poorer...

79
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,840
...in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

80
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, I think so.

81
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,280
And you, Eugenia. Eugenia?

82
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,040
Yes, Father?

83
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,840
Do you take Arturo
as your husband?

84
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,200
Sure. Of course I do.

85
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,840
What God has united,
let no man tear asunder.

86
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,200
Can we kiss now, Father?

87
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,320
My child, you mustn't trust any man.

88
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,960
Not even my husband?

89
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,600
You can't be too careful.

90
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,800
Fine. We'll check it later.

91
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,560
Roll it.

92
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,200
- You start rehearsing.
- Thank you.

93
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
Here. Drink.

94
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
I'm not thirsty.

95
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,400
It'll help you to sleep.

96
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,240
I already tried it,
and it didn't help.

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,640
How many men
have you had to forget?

98
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,680
As many as the women
you remember.

99
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,120
Don't go.

100
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,560
I haven't moved.

101
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,560
Say something nice.

102
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,440
What shall I say?

103
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,120
Lie. Tell me you've
waited for me forever.

104
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,360
I've waited for you
all these years.

105
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,760
Say you'd die
if I didn't return.

106
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,080
I'd have died
if you hadn't returned.

107
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,600
Say you still love me
as I love you.

108
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,480
I still love you as you love me.

109
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,880
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

110
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,880
Pepa, are you okay?

111
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,880
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

112
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
You've got some nerve.

113
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,120
Call this number, please.

114
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,360
You have no right, Pepa.

115
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,800
Just dial the number.

116
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,360
You're making a fool of yourself.

117
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,840
Well, a little more won't hurt.

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,720
- Were you crying?
- Yes.

119
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,120
There! You see? I knew it, Pepa.

120
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,760
Dial! They won't like
you holding up our work.

121
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,240
Yes, right away.
Excuse me! At your service!

122
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,680
My coffee can wait.

123
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,440
I've had enough breakfasts
in my time.

124
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
The other woman's number.

125
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,560
She'll never learn. Not her.

126
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,400
She should have by now.
Not her.

127
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
No way.

128
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
- Who's this?
- Pepa Marcos. Is Ivan there?

129
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,920
- Forgive my bothering you.
- Not as sorry as I am.

130
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,680
I must speak to him. It's urgent.

131
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,160
How dare you call here?

132
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,360
Don't yell at me.
I just had a fainting spell.

133
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,440
I don't care if you drop dead!

134
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
Look, Ivan and I are finished.

135
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,400
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off yourself!

136
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,800
Just tell him to call me.

137
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,560
Pepa, I didn't know
you had fainted.

138
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,000
Poor thing.

139
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,760
This is too much!

140
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,520
Don't you dare defend her!

141
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,080
- Mom.
- Yes?

142
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,560
We should talk.

143
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,560
Not now. I'm doing my eye lines,
and you make me nervous.

144
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,480
Okay. Then later?

145
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,080
Later. Later.

146
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,320
What's wrong?

147
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,400
That bitch Ivan sleeps with
had the nerve to call me.

148
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,560
He should be more discreet.

149
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,040
Why haven't I thrown those out?

150
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,880
Dad wouldn't let you.

151
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,600
I could sell them at the store,
you know?

152
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,520
I like wearing them.

153
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,440
It's as if time stood still.

154
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,520
Well, it hasn't stood still.

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,040
Don't be rude.
Let her wear what she wants.

156
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,920
Go on. Humor her.
She'll never get well.

157
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,840
Let me help you.

158
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,680
- Hold that.
- Let's see. There.

159
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,520
Like it?

160
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,440
You look terrific.

161
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,000
You're a great liar, Dad.
That's why I love you.

162
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,720
You think it's too dark?

163
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,880
- No.
- Neither do I.

164
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
- Am I interrupting something?
- No. How are you?

165
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,760
- Fine.
- How's the penthouse?

166
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,240
- Are you enjoying it?
- It's great, but I'm here to sublet it.

167
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,360
We'll get a good price for it.

168
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,640
Good. I'll want to rent an apartment.

169
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,520
Can I make a call?
I've been out all day.

170
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,440
What type of apartment?

171
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,600
With a terrace, but not so big.

172
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
- Yours is number seven Montalban?
- Yes, seventh floor.

173
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,720
220 square yards
including the terrace.

174
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,000
Everybody just loved
your scale model.

175
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,440
It turned out well.

176
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,200
The jerk hasn't called.

177
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,200
- How much is that?
- 200 pesetas.

178
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,400
- Is Isabel here?
- She's busy. Can I help you?

179
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,000
- I have to see her.
- One moment.

180
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,800
Hi.

181
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
You want to try a facial?

182
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,720
- I can't now.
- It's free.

183
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,960
They're giving a demonstration.

184
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,800
I need sleeping pills.

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,440
I've run out.

186
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,560
- You have the prescription?
- No. I'll bring it later or tomorrow.

187
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,840
I can't sleep without them.

188
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,560
- Okay.
- Thanks.

189
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,160
- She's not much in person.
- She's skinnier than on TV.

190
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,240
Pepa, honey, are you there?

191
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,040
If I can't reach you,
I'm going to get worried.

192
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,480
So am I.

193
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,400
I've had no luck
reaching you today, so...

194
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,160
Well?

195
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
I feel you're avoiding me.

196
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,040
Such bullshit.

197
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,760
I'll keep trying until I get you.

198
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,120
- I may get lucky.
- Sure.

199
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,720
I really want to talk to you.

200
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,600
- I miss you.
- I noticed.

201
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,840
Well, take care.

202
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
See you later.

203
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,840
Asshole.

204
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,800
This is Juan
at the real estate agency.

205
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,080
Tomorrow I'm sending a couple
to see your apartment.

206
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,640
Try to be there in the morning.
Thank you.

207
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm sick of being good.

208
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,600
I shouldn't smoke.

209
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm finally getting rid of this shit!

210
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,520
And this dumb flower!

211
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,040
Who'd think of giving a duck
as a present?

212
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,480
Only you.

213
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,640
But now I'll get rid of it all.
And of you!

214
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,920
"Something's come up
that concerns both of us.

215
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,320
I must talk to you before you leave."

216
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
Follow that cab!

217
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,160
I thought this only happened
in the movies.

218
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,840
WELCOME TO MAMBO TAXI

219
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,760
MAGAZINES FOR RENT

220
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,040
Help yourself.
It's on the house.

221
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,720
Thanks. Just follow that cab.

222
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,560
Don't worry. It's under control.

223
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,240
Do you mind the Mambo?

224
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,400
I've got everything.
Heavy metal, rock, soul...

225
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,440
...cumbias, even sevillanas.

226
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,840
Salsa, techno-pop...

227
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,440
...whatever you like.

228
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,920
- You really like Mambo?
- I love Mambo.

229
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,120
Yes, the Mambo...

230
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,840
...goes best with this decor.

231
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,240
You're that TV actress.

232
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,720
You play the killer's mother.

233
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,400
How about an autograph?

234
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,360
It's for my girlfriend.
Could you make it personal?

235
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,080
- What's her name?
- Azucena.

236
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,640
THANK YOU FOR SMOKING

237
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,960
- It stopped.
- What's the address?

238
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,600
Thirty-eight Almagro,
but I don't know what floor.

239
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,000
She waved.

240
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,720
Do you think she's on to us?

241
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,640
I don't care.

242
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,680
Where to now?

243
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,920
Montalban, and thank you.

244
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,920
Ladies, there's something
for you to lean on.

245
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,400
Hope it does you more good
than it did me.

246
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,520
Here's your food,
and that's to sleep on.

247
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,160
You can shit on it all you like.

248
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,800
Hey. Jump here. Jump!

249
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,520
She won't jump. She hates it.

250
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,360
Well, back to my waiting.

251
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,120
Number 38 Almagro.

252
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,560
Number 38 Almagro.
Let's see.

253
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,600
Almagro, Almagro,
Almagro.

254
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,080
Thirty-one, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38.

255
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,040
410-0430.

256
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,400
Of course!

257
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,400
Of course. It's the same one
who insulted me this morning.

258
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,840
Hello.

259
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm the mother
of the notorious "Crossroads Killer."

260
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,840
When my son comes home
after one of his famous crimes...

261
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,280
...his clothes are just filthy.

262
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,240
Where are the clothes
your son wore...

263
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,480
At the time of the murder?

264
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,280
Right here. Sparkling clean.

265
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,760
- No trace of blood.
- Or guts.

266
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,160
Unbelievable.

267
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,800
Ecce Homo. It's unbelievable.

268
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,560
A group of armed Shiites
was captured here in Madrid today...

269
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,840
...according to police sources.

270
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,680
A local Shiite spokesman
living in Madrid...

271
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,280
...stated that the commando group
was acting on its own...

272
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,600
...without any connection
to the Shiite community.

273
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,440
The same police sources...

274
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,680
...promise to release
additional information...

275
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,600
...within a few hours...

276
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,800
...after the interrogations
are completed.

277
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,080
Oh, my book!

278
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,160
Ivan, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.

279
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,720
Leave a message
telling me where and when.

280
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,720
I'm going out
to look for you now. Bye.

281
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,240
It's me, Candela.
I've got to see you.

282
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,040
I'm going out. Call me later.

283
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,920
- I'm in trouble.
- So am I. Goodbye.

284
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,840
Pepa! Damn it, I need you!

285
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,440
- Pepa, it's me.
- That woman!

286
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,240
Pepa, answer.

287
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,200
I'm in big trouble.

288
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,080
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

289
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,480
- What are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

290
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,520
Well, make it!

291
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,720
- Your mother's too much.
- I'm sorry, Marisa.

292
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,720
- And that slut in the window!
- What slut? Where?

293
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,960
Weren't you going to use the phone?
Why don't you use it?

294
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,480
Let's go.

295
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,240
Gather everything and let's go.

296
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,000
"Something's come up
that concerns us both.

297
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,920
I must talk to you
before you leave."

298
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,880
Throw that away!

299
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,160
God, I hope he called.

300
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,800
Pepa, it's 5:00 A.M.

301
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm across from your place,
and you're still not home.

302
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,160
I don't know which end is up
anymore!

303
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,880
I can't explain over the phone.

304
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,320
What a pest!

305
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,600
I'll tell you one thing...

306
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,600
I don't understand,
because if you had a problem...

307
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,520
You'll feel guilty about this!

308
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,640
- It's you.
- I called a million times.

309
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,560
You're a drag!

310
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,600
Don't say that, or I'll leave.

311
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,520
Come on in.

312
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,960
I've been out all night.

313
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,400
So have I.

314
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,840
Let's have some coffee.

315
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,200
- Going somewhere?
- No. Ivan's leaving me.

316
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,080
- We're doing great.
- My life's a mess.

317
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,520
Mine too.

318
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,840
- Problems at work?
- No. I couldn't tell you on the phone.

319
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,720
The phone! I just ripped it out!

320
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,040
Damn! I'll have to call
the phone company.

321
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,680
Can I stay here?

322
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
I'm in big trouble, Pepa!

323
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,560
Fix the coffee, then we'll talk.
You're a pain today!

324
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,200
What?

325
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,640
Don't call me a pain!
I'm feeling very vulnerable.

326
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,880
My God.

327
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,720
Looks like the work of terrorists.

328
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,520
Oh, the phone...

329
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,760
This just isn't normal.

330
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,680
God, the cops. I'm dead.

331
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,400
Hello.

332
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,320
Open up.
We know you're in there.

333
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,200
- What do you want?
- To see the apartment.

334
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
- Which one?
- This one.

335
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,360
- Why?
- To rent it.

336
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,680
The real estate agency sent us.

337
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,360
In that case...

338
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,840
Come in. The owner
will be back in a minute.

339
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
- Carlos.
- Yes, honey?

340
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,880
It's too high.

341
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,800
Darling, it's a penthouse.

342
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,520
- And expensive.
- Super-expensive.

343
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,200
But it's a great location.

344
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,920
I want a real house,
and this is not a real house.

345
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,520
The girl is right.

346
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,840
Don't call me a girl.

347
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,520
Carlos.

348
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,120
Yes, my love?

349
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,040
You call this great too?

350
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,480
Christ.

351
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,240
Pepa is really something.

352
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,080
Let's go. Come on.

353
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,000
Drop that! You're a cop, right?

354
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,040
My Carlos a cop?
Very funny!

355
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,480
I'm no cop.

356
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,040
Isn't that your father?

357
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,800
Nice people don't touch
what is not theirs.

358
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,240
Why is this here?

359
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,680
I don't know.

360
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,040
- Do you know her?
- That's Pepa.

361
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
You know Pepa?

362
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,840
Not personally, no.

363
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,320
Well, here I am.

364
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,320
You know who I am?

365
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,360
Did you see the bed?

366
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,880
I think so, ma'am.
You know who I am?

367
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,560
Since last night.
But don't call me ma'am.

368
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,160
Ivan sent you for his bag?

369
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,160
- No, the realtor sent us.
- What a coincidence.

370
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,400
I'm glad to meet you anyway.

371
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,800
- This is Marisa.
- Who?

372
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,240
Oh, hello.

373
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,720
I'm his fiancée.

374
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,560
Very nice.
I'm his father's ex-lover.

375
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,000
Pepa, listen...

376
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,440
This is Candela.

377
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,200
Pleased to meet you.

378
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,280
Carlos, please.

379
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,280
Pardon the mess.
My life's been hectic lately.

380
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,120
Can you fix telephones?

381
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,200
I can try.

382
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
Come with me.

383
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,360
This one's out of order...

384
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,240
...and I'm expecting a call
from your dad.

385
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,160
Candela, make some coffee.

386
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,440
We have to go.

387
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,360
Yeah. Good idea.

388
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,400
Don't be rude.
This is my house.

389
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,480
We've got to talk.

390
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,080
It can't be that urgent!

391
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,000
- Have you any tools?
- Yes, in the kitchen.

392
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,880
I'll go get them.

393
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,320
Is this any time for repairs?

394
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,280
Don't you recognize her?

395
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,440
She was in the phone booth
last night.

396
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,040
I hadn't noticed.

397
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,360
If you don't want me here, say so.

398
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,360
Who says I don't?

399
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,520
I just learned
that my ex-lover has a son.

400
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,280
And he's here.

401
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,000
Shouldn't he come first?

402
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,000
But I've got a big problem.

403
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,240
Okay, we'll talk.

404
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,720
Let me know when we're leaving.

405
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,320
It won't take long.

406
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,920
Here.

407
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,800
Where's Ivan?

408
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,240
I don't know.

409
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,280
Why doesn't he call?
I need to talk to him.

410
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,200
I don't see him very much.

411
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,040
Don't lie.
He's taking a trip with your mom.

412
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,600
My mother thinks
he's going with you.

413
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,000
Then it's someone else.

414
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,840
So that's why
he didn't sleep at his studio!

415
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,600
- How do you know?
- I spent all night keeping watch.

416
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,040
You must think I'm crazy.

417
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,480
No. You're just nervous
from a lack of sleep.

418
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,240
You didn't know about me?

419
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,480
Never. I had no idea.

420
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,560
Ivan never tells me anything.

421
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,480
I just find things out.

422
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,640
Last night,
when I saw your picture...

423
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,040
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

424
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,080
- That's how I knew.

425
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,920
He never says anything,
never admits anything...

426
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,160
...never criticizes.

427
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,520
Do you think I didn't know
he was cheating?

428
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,400
Sure, but I put up with it.

429
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,280
I tried talking to him civilly,
but it didn't work.

430
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,040
So I begged him not to lie
about important things...

431
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,600
...and to tell me
if he stopped loving me.

432
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,040
Last week, I finally got him
to admit he didn't love me.

433
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,960
It was like pulling teeth.

434
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,400
Thanks for listening,
since your father wouldn't.

435
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,000
Waiting for his call
had me ready to choke myself...

436
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,120
...with the telephone cord.

437
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,560
- So I ripped out the phone.
- You did right.

438
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,760
She's gonna jump!

439
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,520
Your friend's jumping!

440
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,600
She jumped!

441
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,640
Help!

442
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Carlos, be careful!

443
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,600
Don't let go of me, Pepa!

444
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,440
Oh, my God! I can't do it.

445
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,520
Come on! Pull!

446
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,560
You could have killed yourself!

447
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,920
That was the idea!

448
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm desperate.

449
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,520
So am I, and I don't go
jumping off terraces.

450
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,360
Young people don't know
how to fight for things.

451
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,240
You think life is all pleasure.

452
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,840
Well, it isn't.

453
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,680
You have to suffer a lot.

454
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,560
Pepa, please.
This isn't the right time.

455
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,920
Yes. I'm sorry.

456
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,520
It's because you scared me.

457
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,160
- Ivan...
- Yes?

458
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,760
I mean Carlos. Bring me
my tranquilizers from the kitchen.

459
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,400
I'm in big trouble.

460
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,480
I can see that.

461
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
Carlos, do you love me?

462
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Please, not now.

463
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,560
Okay, what's wrong?

464
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,560
Three months ago,
I spent a weekend with a guy.

465
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,360
I didn't know his name or anything,
but after he left...

466
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,920
...I couldn't get him out of my mind.

467
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,520
What happened that weekend?

468
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,360
Nothing special.
We fucked the whole weekend.

469
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,680
Just thinking about it
gives me goose bumps.

470
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,720
It was like a revelation.

471
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,040
Like making love
for the first time.

472
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,960
I loved it.

473
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,960
Sex means a lot at your age.

474
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,920
Because he's like a terrorist.

475
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,880
He's more intense
than other guys.

476
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,440
I knew he'd be back,
and I'd agree to anything.

477
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,400
He came back?

478
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,240
Two weeks ago,
with two more guys.

479
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,960
- You let them all stay?
- They were with him.

480
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,640
- They took advantage.
- Wait, wait.

481
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,520
I noticed
something weird about them...

482
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,400
...and he confessed
that they were Shiite terrorists.

483
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,800
I flipped. I really did.

484
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,160
I knew it could be dangerous,
but I didn't think about it.

485
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,880
What's worse, they had weapons...

486
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,920
...and were planning
to attack somewhere.

487
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,720
Then I said to him:

488
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,720
"You should have
told me about this."

489
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,800
That's when I realized it was a ploy.

490
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,720
He didn't love me. He used me.

491
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
Gazpacho.

492
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,320
You didn't call the cops?

493
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,720
Delicious.

494
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,720
How could I?
I was a hostage in my own house.

495
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,080
- They were arrested yesterday?
- Yes.

496
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,800
- The ones on TV?
- I threw out all their stuff...

497
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,720
...but if they confess
where they were living...

498
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,080
If they're tortured,
they might tell.

499
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,760
They probably won't tell.

500
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,200
But if they do, the cops will
want me for collaborating...

501
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,560
...and you for not alerting them.

502
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,680
In my house,
I collaborate with whomever I want.

503
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,720
I didn't know where to go.

504
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,440
I couldn't face my folks.

505
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,920
It's bad enough
that I became a model.

506
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,720
You need to see a lawyer.

507
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,080
I'll arrange for that.
You can't leave now.

508
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,440
- Go to Paulina Morales.
- The feminist?

509
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,520
A feminist?

510
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,760
As a woman,
she'll take a personal interest.

511
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,160
I'll go change.
Then give me her address.

512
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,880
Why are men like that?

513
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,960
I really don't understand.

514
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,320
I couldn't stand to be
with a man right now.

515
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,320
That's all I needed!

516
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,520
Help me!

517
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,240
- What happened?
- Nothing. She fell asleep.

518
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,680
So suddenly?

519
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,560
The strangest things
can happen suddenly.

520
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,920
You should know, Candela.

521
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,840
It's true.

522
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,280
But a minute ago...

523
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,640
A minute ago
she wanted to go home...

524
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,880
...but since you ignored her...

525
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,120
...she got depressed
and had some gazpacho.

526
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,280
That made her fall asleep?

527
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,800
Yes. It was spiked with barbiturates.

528
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,520
Sorry.

529
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,400
We could call a doctor.

530
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,320
- What kind of barbiturates?
- Morphidal.

531
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,920
- How many?
- Twenty-five or thirty.

532
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,720
She'll have a good sleep.

533
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,720
Why did you do that?
Were you trying to kill yourself too?

534
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,280
It was for your dad.
He loves gazpacho.

535
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,680
It's no excuse...

536
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,160
...but after waiting for hours,
I just lost control.

537
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,080
That's what happened to me.

538
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,120
It could happen to anyone.

539
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,080
Don't get me wrong.

540
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,640
I didn't want to kill him.
Just to make him stay.

541
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,840
I meant to throw it, but...

542
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,760
I understand perfectly.

543
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,480
Thanks. The lawyer's address?

544
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,400
Thirty-one Castellana.

545
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,320
Do you mind staying?

546
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,720
The house is so full of women.

547
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,240
- I'll stay as long as you like.
- Thanks. And fix the phone?

548
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,600
- Are you okay?
- A bit shaken, but...

549
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,840
Don't let her near the ledge.
See you later.

550
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,720
Forget it.

551
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,840
Hi, Ana.

552
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,240
Look what fell down from the sky.

553
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,960
It's mine. Thanks.

554
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,760
It seemed strange. Just one.

555
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,720
Be more careful!

556
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,240
Ana was arguing
with her boyfriend...

557
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,000
...and it almost hit her head.

558
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,720
- You again!
- Hope you don't mind.

559
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,400
Thirty-one Castellana.

560
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,680
I'm glad to see you.

561
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,080
My girlfriend loved the autograph.

562
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,200
When I tell her I saw you again,
she'll think we...

563
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,600
Do you have eyedrops?

564
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,120
No. Sorry.

565
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,440
We could buy some.

566
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,800
That's okay.

567
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,800
Why didn't I think of eyedrops?

568
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,840
What a dope!

569
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,040
It's working.

570
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,120
Forget about them.

571
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,440
But they're hijacking
the 10:00 p.m. Stockholm flight...

572
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,480
...and taking it to Beirut
to free some Shiite prisoners.

573
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,640
That flight will be fully booked.
We must report it.

574
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,640
Then the cops will get me too!

575
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,560
I'll talk fast
so they can't trace the call.

576
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,160
Yeah. You have a way with words.

577
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,360
Police precinct. Hello.

578
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,920
Tonight's 10:00 p.m. Flight...

579
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,000
...to Stockholm...

580
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,560
...will be hijacked
by Shiite terrorists.

581
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,920
Thanks.

582
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,240
Here we are.

583
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,000
Don't tell anyone I cried.

584
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,920
It'll be our secret.

585
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,520
Good.

586
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,680
- Here?
- Where it says "sign."

587
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,400
Is Paulina Morales in?

588
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,760
She's not seeing anyone
this afternoon.

589
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,960
It's urgent. It won't take long.

590
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,520
Come on. You can arrange it.

591
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,880
- Okay. Come on.
- Thanks.

592
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,120
See you later.

593
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,280
Wait here.

594
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,280
I'm coming.

595
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,720
Can I use the phone?

596
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,280
Okay.

597
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,200
Is Paulina there?

598
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,920
Ivan?

599
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,080
I'm going crazy.

600
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,560
"Stockholm."

601
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,440
You can go in.

602
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,240
- Of all the nerve!
- She said I could come in.

603
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,480
I'm in a hurry.

604
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,440
Don't worry.
This won't take long.

605
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,440
May I sit down?

606
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,360
Go ahead.

607
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,280
What's the problem?

608
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,320
A friend of mine is in trouble.

609
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480
A "problem."

610
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,560
She got involved
with a Shiite terrorist.

611
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,560
I'm dying to smoke. May I?

612
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,960
The shoe is hers.

613
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,720
Anyway, he showed up
with two more Shiites.

614
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,000
Three Shiites.

615
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,840
All three just moved in.

616
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,760
Now they've been arrested...

617
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,360
...and she's scared shitless.

618
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,880
So she needs a lawyer.

619
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,960
Why come to me?

620
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,520
- You're a feminist.
- So?

621
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,760
This is clear-cut chauvinism.

622
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,120
I'm going on a trip.
I'll recommend a colleague.

623
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,360
There's not much to be done.

624
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,360
She must turn herself in,
go to jail...

625
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,560
...and let the jury decide her case.

626
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,200
- I don't understand.
- She's committed a crime.

627
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,800
Her only crime was falling in love
and being afraid.

628
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,640
I'd do the same.

629
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,360
I'm sure.

630
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,560
I don't believe this!

631
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,880
And whom were you crying for?
Your friend?

632
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,880
Not over her.

633
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,640
You see?

634
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,400
Aren't you the victim?

635
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,880
Yes. I've also been cheated on.

636
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,320
By a terrorist?

637
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,080
You could say that.

638
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,440
But not a Shiite. He's from Madrid.

639
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,880
I don't give advice to the lovelorn.

640
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,920
You're certainly no lawyer,
you bitch!

641
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,440
Leave, or I'll call the police!

642
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,240
Was it helpful?

643
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,160
Yes. I feel much better.

644
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,680
Good.

645
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,640
What's this doing here?

646
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,960
A kid brought it
and said it's for Mr. Ivan.

647
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,360
If he wants it, let him come upstairs
and show his face!

648
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,080
Fine. Do you need some help?

649
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,600
No, I don't!

650
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,920
Pepa, I'm here in Madrid with you.
That's all I need.

651
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:24,000
I'm also with you, and I'm so happy
to see you write this card. Pepa.

652
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,520
He called?

653
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah. I answered.

654
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,440
Well? Give me that!

655
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,840
- I shouldn't read your postcards.
- Never mind. What did he say?

656
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,080
He's too embarrassed to see you,
because...

657
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,000
...you know who I am.

658
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,560
How sensitive of him!

659
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,480
I don't want to see him either...

660
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,000
...but if he wants
his damn suitcase...

661
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,280
...he'll have to come and get it!

662
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,120
- How are the girls?
- Fine.

663
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,560
Where's Candela?

664
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,320
In your room.

665
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,760
Did anything happen?

666
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,120
No, no. Did you see the lawyer?

667
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,200
Yes. I'll tell you about it later.

668
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,440
You mind my wearing your dress?

669
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,480
Keep it. It looks nicer on you.

670
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,840
Don't lose it again.
My shoes don't fit you.

671
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,560
- You saw the lawyer?
- Yes.

672
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,440
We're taking a trip.

673
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,960
Running from the law
like two fugitives?

674
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,120
It's best if we take a vacation
away from Madrid.

675
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,040
I sure need one.

676
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,480
I knew they'd lock me up...

677
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,400
...and get you for hiding me.

678
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,320
Nothing will happen.

679
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,400
We'll come back in a week.

680
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,440
You'll go to court
and tell everything...

681
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,000
...except for the fucking,
and that'll be that.

682
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,000
Really? Don't lie to me.
You know I'm naive.

683
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,560
The lawyer said not to worry...

684
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,240
...just to stay in touch with her.

685
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,160
I'm causing so much trouble...

686
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,200
...as if you don't have
enough of your own.

687
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,760
Let's water the plants now.

688
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,920
Then we'll pack our bags.

689
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,560
"Dr. J. Pardo.

690
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,120
Test results
on patient Pepa Marcos."

691
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,840
Christ!

692
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,560
- What about the animals?
- I don't know.

693
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,360
Your stepson was
snooping around all day, spying.

694
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,240
It's quite natural,
but he won't find much.

695
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,320
Relax. Let me do that.

696
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,600
Why?

697
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,000
- You feel okay?
- Sure.

698
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,800
You two clean the cage
while I water.

699
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,720
Poor things.
You're going to miss me.

700
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,640
You're depressed.

701
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,360
Just like me.

702
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,920
But you'll come along when I move.

703
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,840
I won't leave you alone.

704
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,320
I'd be a fine one to abandon you.

705
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,800
She's out cold. Let's see.

706
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,080
Anyway, who cares?
Too bad for her.

707
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,960
Poor bunnies!

708
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,720
Look. Totally dry.

709
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,960
Pepa just has
too much on her mind.

710
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,840
Did you ever have rabbits?

711
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,800
Back home I had many.

712
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,800
I know lots about them.

713
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,520
Look how they love turnips.

714
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,840
Carlos, I'm sorry I teased you
about your stuttering.

715
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,560
- Sometimes I'm so dumb.
- Forget it.

716
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,640
But you went a little too far.

717
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,200
You didn't behave properly.

718
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,560
Men keep taking advantage of me.

719
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,920
I always realize it when it's too late.

720
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:05,040
Look how the Arab world treated me.

721
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,600
I sure didn't deserve that.

722
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,200
This is Lucia.
I need to see you.

723
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,760
I can't. I'm leaving town.

724
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,400
We have to talk.

725
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,200
About something
that concerns us both.

726
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,480
If you mean Ivan,
I'm not interested.

727
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,920
Then why are you
going away with him?

728
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,640
Lady, you're nuts!

729
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,040
Between Ivan and me,
there's nothing but pain.

730
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,440
I'm coming anyway.
I know where you live.

731
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,920
For two days everyone
has been saying "no" to me.

732
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,280
Now it's my turn to say "no."

733
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,680
I must see Ivan
before he leaves.

734
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,960
Look somewhere else
and leave me alone!

735
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,280
- That was Mom?
- Yes.

736
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,040
Don't be too hard on her.

737
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,960
The way she talks...

738
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,320
She's mentally ill.

739
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,480
She threatened to come here.

740
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,000
- She shouldn't see you.
- And me?

741
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,800
Fix Marisa some coffee.
We need to talk.

742
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,840
The lawyer didn't work out.
We got into a fight.

743
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,480
She won't defend her?

744
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,360
She'd rather prosecute her.
How'd you meet her?

745
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,720
She was Mom's lawyer.

746
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,480
I'm not surprised
your mother is sick.

747
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,520
They split up before I was born.

748
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,480
After my birth, she went crazy...

749
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,400
...and was placed
in a mental institution.

750
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,160
My grandparents raised me.

751
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,800
They wouldn't let Ivan see me.

752
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,880
You can look now.

753
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,320
Mom was released a year ago.

754
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,480
When she got out,
she wanted to go back to Ivan...

755
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,800
...but he was with you.

756
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,880
Can you zip me up?

757
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,760
So she sued him for millions...

758
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,160
...for all the time
she'd been locked up.

759
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,840
Paulina was her lawyer.

760
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,760
Your mother doesn't mess around.

761
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,520
Paulina tried to sue Ivan,
but it didn't work.

762
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,560
What an insane story.

763
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,200
Mom hates me.

764
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,800
I represent all her years
without Ivan.

765
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,680
Well, I love you.

766
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,520
You're the only good thing
Ivan ever did.

767
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,400
- Oh, it's you.
- I didn't want to interrupt.

768
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,600
- Why so dressed up?
- I'm going out.

769
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,400
Don't mention the lawyer.

770
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,320
- What?
- See if you can wake up Marisa.

771
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,000
- And if not?
- It's up to you.

772
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,840
- Anyway, we're leaving.
- What?

773
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,160
- On a trip.
- Where?

774
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,080
- It's a secret.
- We're fugitives.

775
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,720
It's better if you don't know.

776
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,520
- But he knows everything.
- Come on.

777
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,680
What if Ivan calls?

778
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,840
Tell him I expect nothing
from him.

779
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,600
All I have left from him
is the suitcase...

780
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,400
...and I'm getting rid of it now.

781
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,120
No. Don't say anything.

782
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,720
Don't get the phone...

783
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,960
...or the door.

784
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,280
Fine.

785
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,880
I'll be right back.

786
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,200
I overheard about your mom,
and I'm really sorry.

787
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,960
You're a kissing fanatic!

788
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,600
Let's give her some coffee.

789
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,080
What's wrong?

790
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,480
Nothing. She's having fun.

791
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,320
I've never seen her like this.

792
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,280
Don't wake her.
She's having a great time.

793
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,080
See her face?

794
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,200
She's having a ball.

795
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,720
Her face!

796
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,360
Look at her lip!

797
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,400
Hi. I've come for my bag.
Pepa said it was here.

798
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,920
That's strange.
A kid brought it down earlier...

799
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,720
...but when Pepa saw it,
she threw a fit.

800
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,720
- So where's the bag?
- She took it and she said:

801
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,320
"If he wants it,
let him come and get it...

802
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,920
...and show his face!"

803
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,000
That's what she said.

804
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,520
She's upstairs now.

805
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,800
I'm in a hurry.

806
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,440
She's probably calmed down...

807
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,240
...but you never know.

808
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,440
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't tell her I was here.

809
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,000
Sir, I'm a Jehovah's Witness
and cannot tell lies.

810
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,960
Only the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

811
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,360
But if she doesn't ask...

812
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,200
If she asks,
I have to tell the gospel truth.

813
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,840
Goodbye.

814
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,240
I'd like to lie!

815
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,360
The bad thing
about my religion is...

816
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
...that we can't.

817
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,920
I love the sound of the trumpets
on Judgment Day

818
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,880
Ivan, I have to speak
to you immediately.

819
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,360
Leave a message
and tell me when and where.

820
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,960
I can't pick up my bag.

821
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,200
I wanted to talk to you...

822
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,520
...but I see you're avoiding me.

823
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,640
I'll try again in a few days...

824
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,800
...when you're a bit calmer.

825
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,320
I want you to know
that our years together...

826
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,720
...were the best of my life.

827
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,360
I'm not going away
with any woman.

828
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,840
Goodbye, sweetheart.

829
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,840
I wish you the best
with all my heart.

830
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,960
I'm so unhappy

831
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,320
Because you no longer love me

832
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,120
Why should I try
to change your mind

833
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,600
Be happy, my love

834
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:24,960
For I'll never forget
the love you gave me

835
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,720
I'm so unhappy

836
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,200
Look at him!

837
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,960
He's nuts!

838
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,320
I'll show her, all right!

839
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,840
Pepa, you'll pay dearly
for those three Shiites!

840
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,840
I'm not going away
with any women.

841
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,240
Goodbye, sweetheart.
I wish you the best...

842
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,880
Liar!

843
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,600
Maybe it's true.

844
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,960
He can fool me with everything
but his voice.

845
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,440
I know all his intonations.
I worked long enough with him.

846
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,160
Goddamn phone!

847
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,000
What were you doing?

848
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,000
That damn fucking bitch!

849
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,280
What did you see in her?

850
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,840
Let's get your luggage.

851
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,640
- You did it again.
- Forget it.

852
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,240
Calm down!
Just look at this place.

853
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,520
- The cops!
- Take it easy. Come on.

854
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,200
It's Ivan.
I knew he's no coward.

855
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,280
It's your mother.

856
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,680
- Let's play.
- I can't!

857
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,640
- Should I let her in?
- Yes.

858
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,560
- Read the instructions!
- "Strategy is..."

859
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,240
Not out loud!

860
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,080
What are you doing here,
traitor?

861
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,920
- Well...
- Carlos, who is it?

862
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,440
I don't know.

863
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,760
It's the police.

864
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,000
What do they want?

865
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,720
We understood.

866
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,920
- Come on.
- Right.

867
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,400
Shut up or I'll smack you.

868
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,640
Good evening.

869
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,120
Is she with you?

870
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,120
We met in the elevator.

871
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,560
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

872
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,200
- Just discussing the lady's dress.
- It's awful.

873
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,800
- It's just a dress.
- But it's awful.

874
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,280
Maybe she likes it.

875
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,640
Stop acting like a kid
in front of the policemen!

876
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,760
"I love you, need you, want you."

877
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,840
"Your Ivan."

878
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,200
May I ask why you're here?

879
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,720
A call was made
from your telephone...

880
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,280
...about some terrorists.

881
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,240
Pardon?

882
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,680
Someone called from here
about the Shiite terrorists.

883
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,760
See! I told you!

884
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,840
Those kids!

885
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,680
There's been some mistake.
My phone's been out of order all day.

886
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,800
She just now pulled it out.

887
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,160
I called her 20 minutes ago.

888
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,240
Ignore her. She's a bit crazy.

889
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,240
- What am I charged with?
- Nothing.

890
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,760
We just wanted information
about who called.

891
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,120
Who ripped out the phone?

892
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,320
I did. This morning.

893
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,440
So nobody's called
from here today.

894
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,440
Pepa's some talker!

895
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,760
Why?

896
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,400
I was expecting a call.
They didn't call, and I got upset.

897
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,920
Who? Ivan? Where is he?

898
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,160
Shut up. I'll ask the questions.
Well, we will.

899
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,920
Go ahead. Ask her who Ivan is.

900
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,800
- Who's Ivan?
- The cause of this mess...

901
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,200
...and of the mess
your partner's about to see.

902
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,720
He's going to find Marisa.

903
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,920
All right. Explain.

904
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,040
May I sit down?

905
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,760
If I'm to bare my soul,
I'd rather be comfortable.

906
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,640
I've had a hard day.

907
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,080
Are you comfortable?

908
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,800
I'd be more comfortable
alone with my friends...

909
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,240
...playing Strategy.

910
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,840
You can't always
have everything.

911
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,640
We agree on that.

912
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,240
Who is this Ivan?

913
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,320
He was my lover.
Before that he was with her.

914
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,800
He's my son's father.

915
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,160
Him?
What's he doing here?

916
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,280
He came to rent my apartment.

917
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,440
I didn't know.

918
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,640
I get the feeling
you're pulling my leg.

919
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,000
You think I like
baring my soul to strangers?

920
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,080
Well, you're wrong.
It's humiliating.

921
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,800
Damn it, Mom!

922
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,320
- Candela, get me a drink.
- What kind?

923
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,920
- There's gazpacho.
- Right! Gazpacho!

924
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,520
Let's go.

925
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,840
- Where are you going?
- For gazpacho. Want some?

926
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,720
We're on duty,
but we don't want to be rude...

927
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,000
Gazpacho for everyone.

928
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,160
Is she sleeping?

929
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,920
Like a log.
She's Carlos' fiancée.

930
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,200
She was tired.
You want me to wake her up?

931
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,920
Not yet.

932
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,800
Why don't you sit down?
I'm getting a stiff neck.

933
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,960
We have nothing against you...

934
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,440
Thanks a lot.

935
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,280
Without being inquisitive...

936
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,840
...you must admit
this is a little weird.

937
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,840
A charred bedroom...

938
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,520
...a broken phone,
a smashed window...

939
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,080
It's been weird, all right.

940
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,480
Okay. Start at the beginning.

941
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,800
And make it clear,
concise, and fair.

942
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,120
I don't know if I can.

943
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,880
I'm too hurt to be clear,
concise, and fair.

944
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,000
Words!

945
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,160
- Just the facts.
- Okay.

946
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,600
I lived here with Ivan.

947
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,120
We loved each other.
At least, I loved him.

948
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,000
After months of trying
to keep our love together...

949
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,000
...we split up a week ago.

950
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:09,440
He told me to pack his bags.
He'd be taking a trip...

951
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,160
...with another woman.

952
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,960
- He said that?
- He never travels alone.

953
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:17,680
Remember, these two
for the cops. An extra dose.

954
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,520
Careful.

955
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,480
This is too warm.

956
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,960
Carlos, my God!

957
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,760
In front of your mother,
the cops, your fiancée!

958
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,080
Aren't you afraid?

959
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,240
Go on, please.

960
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,040
So I packed up his stuff
and went to work.

961
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,840
When I came back,
the house was like this.

962
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,520
Except for the phone,
which I did.

963
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,120
The suitcase was gone...

964
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,840
...and the bed was all burned.

965
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,480
They're taking very long.
Go. Check.

966
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,040
They're probably kissing.

967
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,040
- What about Marisa?
- She'd better wake up.

968
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,480
Takes after his father.

969
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,760
- Now, who's that?
- Yeah?

970
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,840
- Telephone repair. And you?
- Police.

971
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,600
- Your I.D.?
- And yours?

972
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,440
Are you the lady
who called this morning?

973
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,280
Yes. Here's the phone,
and here's the plug.

974
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,320
I reached her here by phone
20 minutes ago.

975
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,000
There she goes again!

976
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,960
Not on this phone.

977
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,760
Let's get to the point.

978
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,880
Do you know
any Shiite terrorists?

979
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,120
Shut up! He's asking her!

980
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,560
I didn't know Madrid had any.

981
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,360
Do you know them?

982
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,600
Not me. I'm not into politics.

983
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,680
Sure, man.
They were on TV today!

984
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,600
- Shut up!
- You want the TV on?

985
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,440
I'm not interested in Shiites.

986
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,080
Ma'am, what about you?

987
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,520
Pepa and I have
important things to discuss.

988
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,800
Men, right?

989
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,120
What's more important?

990
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,440
Fine. We'll talk about men.

991
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,080
Is Ivan involved
with these terrorists?

992
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:14,120
- Relax.
- Ivan?

993
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,480
I don't know.
He's hidden so many things from me.

994
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,520
Can you give me his address...

995
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,920
...or phone number?

996
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,920
He has no phone.
And he's not home.

997
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,080
I told you he's leaving town.

998
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,520
Try the airport.

999
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,480
The airport? Where's he going?

1000
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,280
Where is he going?

1001
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,160
To Stockholm. Tonight.
With Paulina Morales.

1002
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,320
Stockholm!

1003
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,560
Why didn't you say so before?

1004
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,200
Because I just figured it out.

1005
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,240
Now I understand it all.

1006
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,880
The phone call.

1007
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,640
What an idiot I am!
Why didn't I see it before?

1008
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,120
Your lawyer
played it beautifully.

1009
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,800
You didn't know
they'd be hijacking that flight?

1010
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,520
The Shiites?

1011
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,560
The whole country knows.
It was on TV.

1012
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,080
But the tip
came from this phone.

1013
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,840
I want to know
who the hell called...

1014
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,320
...or I'll haul you all in!

1015
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,160
Why aren't you at the airport?

1016
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:50,600
There are more cops there
than passengers.

1017
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,080
I don't know what's going on...

1018
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,160
...but if you don't start talking...

1019
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:59,000
Chief, this stuff has been spiked.

1020
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,400
What's in the gazpacho?

1021
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,200
Tomatoes, cucumbers...

1022
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,080
...bell pepper, onion...

1023
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,600
...one garlic clove...

1024
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,760
...oil, salt, vinegar...

1025
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,200
...some day-old bread, and water.

1026
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,800
The secret's in mixing it right.

1027
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,520
Ivan loves the way I mix it.

1028
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,840
I made it for him.

1029
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,200
You collect weapons?

1030
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,480
Get back!

1031
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,640
Move back. I don't want
to hurt the kids.

1032
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,320
Is Ivan really going
to Stockholm?

1033
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,080
It's just a hunch,
but I'm pretty sure.

1034
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,320
What did you have to tell him?

1035
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,480
Nothing, now.

1036
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,400
I just want to forget him.

1037
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,160
And you should do the same.

1038
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,920
In the hospital,
I had forgotten him.

1039
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,520
I didn't remember anything.

1040
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,160
Until suddenly...

1041
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,280
...one night,
I heard his voice on TV.

1042
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,240
I didn't recognize his face...

1043
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,320
...just his voice.

1044
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,560
He was telling a woman
he loved her.

1045
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,400
I felt a spasm inside me.

1046
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,920
I remembered all the times
he's said that to me.

1047
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,120
I regained my sanity
and my memory.

1048
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,600
From that moment on...

1049
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,880
...I acted as if I had been cured...

1050
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,960
...and they released me.

1051
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,720
If you're cured,
stop aiming at me.

1052
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,680
But I'm not cured.

1053
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,880
I faked it, and I fooled them.

1054
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,440
I can only forget him
by killing him.

1055
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,480
How will you do that?

1056
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,040
At the airport.

1057
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,040
The airport is full of cops.
You heard him.

1058
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,600
I'll manage.

1059
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,040
Now that you know...

1060
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,000
Let's drink a toast.

1061
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,880
Drink!

1062
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,720
You too.

1063
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,920
Oh, my eyes!

1064
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,720
My eyes!

1065
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,600
She left the door open!

1066
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,680
The door!

1067
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,720
Take me to the airport,
please.

1068
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,280
Sorry. I have a date.

1069
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,920
Take me!

1070
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,640
- What the hell is that?
- A gun. Let's go.

1071
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,360
My girlfriend will be mad.

1072
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,760
Not as mad as I'll be.
Quick, to Stockholm!

1073
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,200
Right under my nose!

1074
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,600
Did you see that?

1075
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,480
Come on. After them!

1076
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,640
You again! Great!

1077
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,160
We're meant for each other!

1078
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,000
Whom do we follow today?

1079
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,360
- That motorcycle!
- That Harley!

1080
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,560
I'll do my best.

1081
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,080
To the airport!

1082
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,240
Blow on my eyes.

1083
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,800
That lady is crazy,
and she carries two guns.

1084
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,240
- Why did she take Ambite?
- Because she's in a hurry.

1085
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,200
Ah! Eyedrops!

1086
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,120
Anything else, ladies?

1087
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,120
No. Just step on it.
That lady is dangerous.

1088
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,120
No lady's dangerous
if you know how to handle her.

1089
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,520
- There they are.
- I've got them.

1090
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,640
I can't see.

1091
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,680
He can never say "no."

1092
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,600
Ana, that lady has two guns,
and she's a nut.

1093
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,080
Look what she did to me!

1094
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,160
You think I go around
like this for fun?

1095
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,840
She's capable of anything!

1096
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,760
My ass is the only one
allowed on that bike.

1097
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,040
I'm fed up.

1098
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,520
I'm gonna get myself
some quick cash...

1099
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,080
...buy myself his bike and split.

1100
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,440
With a bike...

1101
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,400
...who needs a man?

1102
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,360
Learning mechanics is easier
than learning male psychology.

1103
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,760
You can figure out a bike...

1104
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,720
...but you can never
figure out a man.

1105
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,800
She's going for his balls!

1106
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,440
I think she's just
trying to hang on.

1107
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,760
Fresh out of the mental ward...

1108
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,720
...and she looks
like a professional biker.

1109
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,080
Be careful! She's crazy!

1110
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,480
And she has a gun!

1111
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,080
Bitch!

1112
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,760
Get down!

1113
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,400
Shut up, idiot women!

1114
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,320
Leave my man alone!

1115
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,960
Can't you go any faster?

1116
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,560
Lady, this thing is a relic.

1117
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,520
A relic?
Just remember this gun!

1118
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,080
Okay! Don't shoot!

1119
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,520
Don't you sell guns?

1120
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,120
I don't need them.

1121
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,920
What if you're held up?

1122
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,920
I avoid danger, just like now.

1123
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:17,600
Sorry, ladies.
The chase is over.

1124
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,600
Please, just take us
to the airport somehow.

1125
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,560
I'm a taxi driver,
not a bounty hunter.

1126
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,040
I warned you
she was a dangerous woman.

1127
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,840
He said he could deal.

1128
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,120
Right here.

1129
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,840
Thanks.

1130
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,440
Stockholm, please?

1131
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,920
International flights
are over there.

1132
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,440
- You're weak, Ivan.
- Yes, sweetheart.

1133
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,000
- Don't agree with me!
- But you're right.

1134
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,160
Sometimes I like to be wrong.

1135
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,360
Take me back to the hospital.
That's my home.

1136
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,000
Are you all right?

1137
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,880
Let go.

1138
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,360
You saved my life, darling.

1139
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,200
Don't worry.
I don't want anything in return.

1140
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,720
Just one thing.
Tell her to go away!

1141
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,320
Go away!

1142
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,080
Pepa, I'm ashamed.

1143
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,280
I've treated you so badly.

1144
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,440
All I wanted was to talk to you.

1145
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,800
I've spent two days waiting...

1146
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,440
...looking for you,
leaving messages.

1147
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,520
We can talk tonight.

1148
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,440
The trip to Stockholm can wait.

1149
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,880
No. It's too late now.

1150
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,320
Don't hold a grudge.

1151
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,960
Let's have a drink,
now, in the cafeteria.

1152
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,960
Yesterday, this morning,
or even at noon today...

1153
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,800
...we could have.

1154
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,560
But now it's too late.

1155
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,920
It's been too late
for the past two hours.

1156
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,920
Then why did you come out here?

1157
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,080
Lucia wanted to kill you...

1158
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,120
...and I came to stop her.

1159
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,320
Since you're out of danger,
I'm leaving.

1160
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,600
Goodbye.

1161
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,440
Home at last!

1162
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,440
The visitors...

1163
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,680
...are comfortable.

1164
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,040
And the kids?

1165
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:05,440
Candela really manages
to recover quickly.

1166
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,200
Hope he's luckier for her
than the Shiites were.

1167
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,920
God, what a mess!

1168
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,120
The maid comes tomorrow.

1169
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,960
Better wear shoes
with this mess.

1170
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,320
I wonder which is better...

1171
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,040
...slipping on gazpacho,
or cutting myself on the glass.

1172
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,800
The repairman is a doll, but
I'd better save him for Marisa.

1173
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,320
I fell asleep.

1174
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,720
How do you feel?

1175
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,800
Like new. But you don't look so hot.

1176
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,040
Well, I'm going to have a baby.

1177
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,680
I didn't know.

1178
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,800
You're the first person
I've told.

1179
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,840
Congratulations!
You should sit here.

1180
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,480
I'll explain tomorrow.

1181
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,480
- But...
- Sit down.

1182
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:04,400
You just woke up,
but I haven't slept in two days.

1183
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,280
I won't sublet it.

1184
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,120
I love the view.

1185
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,400
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

1186
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,120
How long was I asleep?

1187
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,920
Hours!

1188
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,160
You have beautiful skin.

1189
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,120
I had a dream.

1190
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,800
- A good one?
- I think so.

1191
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,840
I was a virgin this morning...

1192
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,560
...but I don't think I am now.

1193
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:38,440
- Don't tell me one of these jerks...
- No. It was in my dream!

1194
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,400
Great!

1195
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,480
Actually, you've lost...

1196
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,520
...that hard look
that virgins have.

1197
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,680
Virgins are awful.
