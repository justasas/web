Dedicated to Monogram Pictures

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,468
After all, l'm an arsehole.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,593
After all, yes, l must. l must!

4
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,311
Take me with you!

5
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,597
- What time is it?
- 1 0:50.

6
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,718
l'm on my way, hey hey!

7
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,195
lf he thinks he's gonna pass me
in his bloody Renault!

8
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,110
l get the dough,

9
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,430
l ask Patricia, yes or no,

10
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,352
and then...

11
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,039
The countryside's nice.

12
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,789
l really like France.

13
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,630
lf you don't like the shore...

14
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,989
lf you don't like the mountains...

15
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,634
lf you don't like the city...

16
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,752
Then get stuffed!

17
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,555
Little girls trying to hitch a ride!

18
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,995
l'll charge a kiss per mile.

19
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,516
The short one's not bad. Nice thighs.

20
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,399
Yeah, but the other one...

21
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,199
Oh, hell, they're dogs.

22
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,071
The sun's great.

23
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,757
Women drivers
are cowardice personified!

24
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,876
Overtake him!

25
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,996
Shit, roadworks!

26
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,475
Never use the brakes.

27
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,509
As old man Bugatti said:
''My cars are made to run, not to stop''.

28
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,391
Shit! The pigs!

29
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,115
Contact's gone!

30
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,311
A boobytrap!

31
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,352
Freeze!

32
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,353
- Miss Franchini's room?
- She isn't here.

33
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,397
- She live here?
- She's out.

34
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,674
Girls never have a penny!

35
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,753
Coffee.

36
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,031
- How much is a ham and eggs?
- 1 80 F.

37
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,192
Make it one.

38
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,836
Just going for a paper.

39
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,033
Can l come in?

40
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,758
How's it going, precious?

41
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,512
No jacket?

42
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,989
lt's in my Alfa Romeo.

43
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,833
- Want breakfast at the Royal?
- l'm late.

44
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,560
Gotta be at the TV station by 9.

45
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,313
lt's torn.

46
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,473
What've you been up to?

47
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,949
Nothing, l've been travelling.

48
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,031
- What's new around here?
- Dunno.

49
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,149
- You don't go out?
- To the discotheque sometimes.

50
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,878
Still making films?

51
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,270
No. You gotta sleep around.

52
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,271
Do you recollect Enrico?

53
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,877
''Remember'' or ''recall''.
But not ''recollect''.

54
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,828
l work with him at the station.
As script-girl.

55
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,675
When l was broke in December
l was assistant on a picture

56
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,875
at Cinecitta!

57
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,678
- You?
- Yes, me.

58
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,478
Ever been a gigolo?

59
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,993
Why?

60
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,513
Just asking.

61
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,988
l wouldn't mind.

62
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,674
Call me back in a few minutes.

63
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,351
ls Gaby back from Spain?

64
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,670
He's bought the Pergola.

65
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,073
Great.

66
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,038
lt was stupid to paint it all black.

67
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,112
- What's it say there?
- ''Why?''

68
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,595
l smoke Luckies now.

69
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,356
Can you lend me 5000 francs till noon?

70
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,875
l might have known.

71
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,671
You're a louse, Michel.

72
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,193
l'll pay you back.

73
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,555
l'm short.

74
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,356
- Here's 500 if you want.
- No, keep it.

75
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,953
- So, no breakfast at the Royal?
- Thanks, but l'm late.

76
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,199
ls Mr. Tolmachov here?

77
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,555
He's here, but he's not here.

78
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,633
Seen Patricia?

79
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,754
Come with me to Rome?

80
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,718
lt's crazy, but l love you.

81
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,952
l wanted to see
if l'd be glad to see you again.

82
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,031
Where have you been?
Monte Carlo?

83
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,478
No, Marseilles.
There was a chap l had to see.

84
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,392
l tried calling you Monday.

85
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,915
l was out of town Monday.

86
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,831
- l'll take one.
- That's kind of you.

87
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,470
What are you doing here?
l thought you hated Paris.

88
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,029
No, but l've got enemies here.

89
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,792
So you're in danger?

90
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,315
Yeah. Will you come to Rome with me?

91
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,993
To do what?

92
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,388
We'll see.

93
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,949
No, l've got lots to do here.

94
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,429
You going up or down the Champs?

95
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,354
- What's the ''Champs''?
- The Champs Elysees.

96
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,796
l've gotta be on Ave George V.
- OK, see you, then.

97
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,916
C'mon, walk me.

98
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,435
Just to the corner.

99
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,599
- Take it back, no horoscope!
- What's ''horoscope''?

100
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,833
The future. l wanna know
the future. Don't you?

101
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,353
Sure.

102
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,316
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, just looking at you.

103
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,514
You're angry l left without a goodbye.

104
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,638
No, l was furious because l was sad.

105
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,556
lt's nice to wake up next to a girl.

106
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,154
Are you staying in town?

107
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,079
Yeah, l have to see a man
who owes me money.

108
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,798
Then l have to see you.

109
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,791
You don't have to.

110
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,837
Why?

111
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,911
There are prettier girls than me here.

112
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,550
No. lt's odd,
l slept with 2 girls since you.

113
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,359
lt was a washout.

114
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,753
What's a ''washout''?

115
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,550
They were very pretty,
but it was a washout. lt was glum.

116
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,553
So will you come to Rome?
l'm fed up with France.

117
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,233
l can't, Michel.

118
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,393
l have to enrol in the Sorbonne
or my parents stop sending money.

119
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,994
- l've got money.
- We only had 3 nights together!

120
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,513
No, 5.

121
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,999
- Why don't you wear a bra?
- Don't talk like that!

122
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,513
OK, sorry!

123
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,590
What time is it? See you later?

124
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,513
Not later. Tonight, if you like.

125
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,194
- Where?
- Here.

126
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,789
Live dangerously until the end!

127
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,513
Have you anything against youth?

128
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,274
Sure do. l prefer old people.

129
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,874
Police killer identified

130
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,311
Mr. Tolmachov here?

131
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,710
At the airline desk.

132
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,316
- Hi, amigo.
- Hi, sonny.

133
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,038
Was it you who came by at 1 0?

134
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,349
Yeah, for my money.

135
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,272
lt's ready for you.

136
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,430
- How're things?
- l got bored down south.

137
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,636
l came up to see a girl.
And you?

138
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,155
l'm getting out of here.
l'm rusting away.

139
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,675
Better rusted than busted.

140
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,993
Over here.

141
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,560
Have the envelope l gave you?

142
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,359
Why'd the arsehole cross it?

143
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,239
Sign it over to someone else.

144
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,870
Not to me.
l blew my last penny on the races.

145
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,110
And your pal, Bob Montagne?

146
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,317
- He's in the slammer.
- No kidding?

147
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,755
There's Berruti, but l don't trust him.

148
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,876
l thought he was your pal.

149
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,155
ls he back?

150
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,632
Yes, l saw him
in Montparnasse last night.

151
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,030

Who's the girl you came for?

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,272
A New Yorker.

156
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,429

Ask the gentleman over there.

169
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,509
lf it isn't Tolmachov!

170
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,352

As you can see.

Remember how you ratted
on your friend Bob?

174
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,599
What of it?

175
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,228

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,356
Nobody been to see
Mr. Tolmachov recently?

182
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,512
Yes, just 5 minutes ago.
Quite a tall man.

183
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,716
Bloody hell!

184
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,030
Accessory to murder -
mean anything to you?

185
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,675
The Harder They Fall

186
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,193
Bogey...

187
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,197
- l saw a man die.
- Why did he die?

188
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,713
ln an accident.

189
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,235
Take me out to dinner?

190
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,869
Let me make another call first.
Wait for me?

191
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,554
Call from the restaurant.

192
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,076
l'll just be a second.

193
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,631
The French always say one second,
when they mean 5 minutes.

194
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,636
Where we going?

195
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,598
Anywhere... To Saint Michel.

196
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,228
- Sleep with me tonight?
- l don't know.

197
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,790
- Don't you like it with me?
- Sure, l do.

198
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,793
l just read something in the paper...

199
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,757
About a bus conductor...

200
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,436
he stole 5 million to seduce a girl.
lmpersonated a rich impresario.

201
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,354
He took her down to the Riviera.
They blew the lot in 3 days.

202
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,149
The chap didn't chicken out.
He told her:

203
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,074
''lt's stolen money, l'm a hood,
but l like you.''

204
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,230
What's great is that she stuck by him.
She said: ''l like you, too''.

205
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,152
They came back to Paris,

206
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,714
and were nabbed trying to burgle
some posh villas. She was the look-out.

207
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,996
Excuse me, got a light?

208
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,596
Here!
Go buy yourself some matches!

209
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,716
l'd totally forgotten!

210
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,313
- l have an appointment.
- Who with?

211
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,951
A journalist on the Champs Elysees.
We're going to a press conference.

212
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,473
Where? Now?

213
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,714
None of your business.
You can really get on my nerves.

214
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,871
So you're leaving me?

215
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,238
- But l'll see you tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow, tonight, Patricia.

216
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,311
l told you l can't.

217
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,675
Why are you so cruel?

218
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,398
Any taxis around?

219
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,633
My car's parked near the Opera.
Want a lift?

220
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,836
What happened to the Ford?

221
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,399
lt's in the garage.

222
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,198
Let me stay with you.

223
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,749
l've got a headache.

224
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,992
We won't make love.
l just wanna be with you.

225
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,912
That's not it, Michel!

226
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,749
Why are you so sad?

227
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,831
Because l am.

228
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,353
lt's silly.

229
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,114
Why are you so sad?

230
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,077
Should l use ''vous'' or ''tu''?

231
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,913
No difference...
But l can't do without you.

232
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,308
Yes, you can.

233
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,675
Maybe. But l don't want to.

234
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,631
Just look at that great Talbot.
A 2.5 litre.

235
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,360
- You're a kid...
- What?

236
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,155
Oh, l dunno.

237
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,552
Look at me.
l forbid you to meet this chap.

238
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,677
Alas, alas, alas!

239
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,070
l love a girl who has a nice neck,

240
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,038
nice breasts, a nice voice...

241
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,713
nice wrists...

242
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,233
a nice forehead...

243
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,152
nice knees...

244
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,790
But she's such a coward!

245
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,715
lt's right here. Stop.

246
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,395
- Let me park first.
- Don't bother.

247
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,073
Get lost!

248
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,992
l never want to see you again.

249
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,513
Get lost!

250
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,391
You louse!

251
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,115
lt'd be a shame
if that happened to you.

252
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,633
We'll see.

253
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,633
What's wrong?

254
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,194
lf l could dig a hole
and hide in it, l would.

255
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,036
You're better off being like elephants.
When they're sad...

256
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,993
Let me tell you a story.
lt'll take your mind off things.

257
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,957
l've known a girl 2 years.

258
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,590
And now, l suddenly think:
l'll ask her to sleep with me.

259
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,116
lt had never occurred to me.
We met for lunch.

260
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,751
l wanted to say:
We're friends, let's sleep together.

261
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,072
l don't know why,
but it completely slipped my mind!

262
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,238
Later l suddenly remembered
and sent her a telegram, saying

263
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,960
l'd forgotten to say
we should sleep together.

264
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,159
3 hours later l get
a message back, saying:

265
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,629
''What an amazing coincidence!

266
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,110
''l was going
to suggest the same thing!''

267
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,555
- ls this the late edition?
- Yes, sir.

268
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,639
Seen my key?

269
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,951
You must've left it in the door.

270
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,953
Oh, no!

271
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,752
What are you doing here?

272
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,514
The Claridge was booked solid.

273
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,389
So l came here.
l took the key downstairs.

274
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,314
There are other places
than the Claridge.

275
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,076
- l always stay at the Claridge.
- You're crazy!

276
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,516
Quit pulling a long face!

277
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,432
lt doesn't suit you.

278
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,508
- ''Pulling a long face''?
- Doing like this!

279
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,436
lt suits me fine.

280
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,079
You're even crazier than me.

281
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,593
What a pain.

282
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,034
l always fall for girls
who aren't cut out for me.

283
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,318
Did you notice
l followed you last night?

284
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,153
What's wrong?

285
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,039
Leave me alone. l'm thinking.

286
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,353
What about?

287
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,516
The thing is, l don't even know.

288
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,033
Well, l do.

289
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,395
No, nobody does.

290
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,791
You're thinking about last night.
Yes, you are.

291
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,909
Last night l was furious,
but now l couldn't care less.

292
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,833
l'm not thinking about anything.

293
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,119
l'd like to think about something,
but l can't seem to.

294
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,068
Well, l'm tired, very tired,

295
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,152
and l'm going back to sleep.

296
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,758
- Why're you looking at me?
- Because l am.

297
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,276
- You should've stayed last night.
- l couldn't.

298
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,558
You should've told the chap
you couldn't see him.

299
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,359
l had to.
He's getting me articles to write.

300
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,034
lt's really important for me.

301
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,078
No, what's important
is going to Rome with me.

302
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,516
Maybe, l don't know.

303
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,035
Did you sleep with him?

304
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,753
l bet you did.

305
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,559
No. He's really sweet.

306
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,315
He said one day we'd sleep together
but not now.

307
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,675
But he doesn't even know me.

308
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,638
Not you... Him and me.

309
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,473
We had a drink in Montparnasse.

310
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,996
l was there, too. At what time?

311
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,039
l don't know. We didn't stay long.

312
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,795
Why'd you come here, Michel?

313
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,872
Because l want to sleep
with you again.

314
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,510
That's hardly a reason.

315
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,636
Sure, it is. lt means l love you.

316
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,270
But l don't know if l love you yet.

317
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,078
When will you know?

318
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,276
Soon.

319
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,910
What do you mean: ''soon''?
ln a month, in a year?

320
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,958
Soon means soon.

321
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,509
A woman never wants to do
in 8 seconds

322
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,150
what she'll want to do
8 days later.

323
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,596
8 seconds or 8 days, it's all the same.

324
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,354
Why not 8 centuries?

325
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,080
No, 8 days is good.

326
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,152
A woman's all half-measures.

327
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,959
lt gets me down.

328
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,076
Why won't you sleep with me again?

329
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,708
Because l'm trying to find out

330
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,714
what it is that l like about you.

331
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,190
l want us to be like Romeo and Juliet.

332
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,157
Just like a girl!

333
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,713
See? You said last night you couldn't
live without me, but you can.

334
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,476
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet,
but you can.

335
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,837
No, l can't live without you.

336
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,073
Just like a man!

337
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,231
Give me a smile.

338
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,590
Right! l'll count to 8.

339
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,038
lf by 8 you haven't smiled,
l'll strangle you.

340
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,152
2...

341
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,799
3...

342
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,076
4, 5, 6...

343
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,878
7...

344
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,758
7 and a half...

345
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,878
7 and three quarters.

346
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,192
You're such a coward
l bet you're gonna smile.

347
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,157
Enough games for today.

348
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,797
Too bad you're a coward.

349
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,598
Why do you say that?

350
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,113
You get on my nerves.

351
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,157
You do, too.

352
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,719
l'm not a coward.

353
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,393
How do you know?

354
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,599
lf a girl says she's not scared,
then can't even light her cigarette,

355
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,433
it means she's scared of something.

356
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,275
l don't know of what,
but she's scared.

357
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,869
- Have one.
- None of those Chesterfields.

358
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,713
Hand me my jacket.

359
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,348
- ln this one?
- Give!

360
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,758
This your passport?

361
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,229
No, my brother's. Mine's in the car.

362
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,755
But it says Kovacs here.

363
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,753
Oh, yeah?
He's not my real brother.

364
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,118
My mum was divorced
by the time he was born.

365
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,875
See? l'm not scared.

366
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,396
- l never said you were.
- You bet, pet.

367
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,799
But you wish you had said it.
And now you're angry.

368
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,918
l'm not talking to you any more.

369
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,957
Do you ever think about death?

370
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,475
l do, all the time.

371
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,594
- What?
- Say something nice.

372
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,877
- Like what?
- l don't know.

373
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,713
Then neither do l.

374
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,068
l like your ashtray.

375
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,196
lt's Swiss.

376
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,114
My granddad had a Rolls-Royce.
Great car!

377
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,795
Never had to raise the bonnet
in 1 5 years!

378
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,439
Seen my new poster?

379
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,793
Come here!

380
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,349
Come here, for Christ's sake!

381
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,877
lt won't do here.
Where can l put it?

382
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,274
Why'd you slap me
when l looked at your legs?

383
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,795
lt wasn't my legs.

384
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,593
lt's exactly the same thing.

385
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:13,199
The French always say things
are the same when they're not at all.

386
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,078
l've thought of something nice.

387
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,231
What?

388
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,198
l want to sleep with you again

389
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,793
because you're beautiful.

390
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,791
l'm not.

391
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,439
Then because you're ugly.

392
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,953
ls it the same?

393
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,470
Yeah, kid, it's the same.

394
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,993
You're a liar, Michel.

395
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,275
No, lying's stupid.

396
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,750
lt's like at poker...
lt's better to tell the truth.

397
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,994
The others think you're bluffing,
and that's how you win.

398
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,553
What is it?

399
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,398
l'll stare at you
until you stop staring at me.

400
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,913
Me, too.

401
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,556
l'll put my poster in the bathroom.

402
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,750
Can l phone?

403
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,475
lt's not bad here.

404
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,756
Just fine.

405
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,833
You like my poster?

406
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,353
Not bad.

407
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,795
Renoir's a really great painter.

408
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,872
l said, not bad!

409
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,673
Think she's prettier than me?

410
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,195
When you're scared or surprised,
or both at once,

411
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,952
there's a funny glint in your eyes.

412
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,189
So what?

413
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,989
l wanna sleep with you again,
because of that glint.

414
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,151
Mind if l piss in the basin?

415
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,072
Guess what l'm going to say.

416
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,435
No idea.

417
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,114
l'm pregnant, Michel.

418
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,911
You heard me.

419
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,559
Whose is it? Mine?

420
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,075
l think so.

421
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,832
Seen a doctor?

422
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,718
Yesterday.

423
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,759
l have to go back Thursday
for tests.

424
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,559
You should've been more careful!

425
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,073
Get me ELY. 99.84.

426
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,912
ls Antonio there?

427
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,710
You don't know if he's coming back?

428
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,916
l'll call back.

429
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,478
ELY. 25.32.

430
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,116
l'm calling
the man who owes me money.

431
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,310
Mr. Tolmachov, please.

432
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,555
Hey, sonny.

433
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,117
l couldn't find Berruti.

434
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,749
l wandered
around Montparnasse all night.

435
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,957
The police?

436
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,597
Thanks. Ciao, sonny.

437
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,310
Shit!

438
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,596
- What?
- l slipped.

439
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,355
Heard the one
about the condemned man?

440
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,675
As he's climbing the scaffold,
he slips and says, ''That figures!''

441
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,314
You look like a Martian up close.

442
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,153
Because my head's in the clouds.

443
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,276
Some idea, having a kid!

444
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,158
But it's not sure.

445
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,390
l wanted to see what you'd say.

446
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,597
- Take your clothes off.
- What's the point?

447
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,877
- You Americans are so stupid.
- Why?

448
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,828
You adore La Fayette
and Maurice Chevalier.

449
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,356
And they're the stupidest French!

450
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,715
l'm making another call.

451
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,757
Belle Epine 35.26.

452
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,957
Patricia, come here!

453
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,391
Mr. Mansard?

454
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,351
Will he be in this afternoon?
Tell him l'll come by.

455
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,512
l'm a friend of Tony's. From Marseilles.

456
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,275
l've got an American.

457
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,833
An American?

458
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,598
Not you. An American car.

459
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,917
l can't find the man
who owes me money. What a pain!

460
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,355
Do you prefer records or the radio?

461
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,592
Quiet, l'm thinking!

462
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,718
l know them all.

463
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,836
- How old are you?
- l'll put the radio on.

464
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,877
l'm 20.

465
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,793
You don't look it.

466
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,030
Why don't you like music?

467
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,270
lt depends. l do...

468
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,908
C'mon, Patricia, come to ltaly.

469
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,789
What's the point of studying
at the Sorbonne?

470
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,918
You never took any exams.

471
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,959
Sure, the baccalaureate.
But l packed it in.

472
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,758
What's ''packed it in''?

473
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,478
l did other things.

474
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,108
- Like what?
- l sold cars.

475
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,759
Here?

476
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,113
ln New York.

477
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,277
You sleep with a lot of men?

478
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,431
Not so many.

479
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,753
How many?

480
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,792
How about you?

481
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,752
Not so many either.

482
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,028
You know where l'd like to live?
Mexico.

483
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,077
l hear it's really lovely.

484
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,472
When l was a kid my dad would say:
We'll go next Saturday.

485
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,438
But he'd always forget.

486
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,475
No, Mexico doesn't grab me.

487
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,756
l bet it's not all that great.

488
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,070
People are such liars.

489
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,198
lt's like Stockholm. Everyone says...

490
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:40,275
''Swedish girls are terrific.
l had 3 a day. Go there.''

491
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,830
l went there. lt's not true.

492
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,833
Swedish girls don't act
the way they do here.

493
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,117
And most of them are dogs
like Parisian girls.

494
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,829
No, Swedish girls are very pretty.

495
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,798
lt's a myth.

496
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,910
One or two maybe - just like in Paris
or London - but not all of them.

497
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,152
The cities where the girls are pretty

498
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,313
- not gorgeous, but like you, charming -

499
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:18,353
girls who rate 1 5 out of 20, because
they have a certain something...

500
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,833
aren't Rome or Paris or Rio
but Lausanne and Geneva.

501
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,629
You tell me something nice, too.

502
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,837
l don't know what, either.

503
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,952
Would you let another man caress you?

504
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,877
You know, you said l'm scared.
lt's true, l'm scared.

505
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,952
Because l want you to love me.

506
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,319
But at the same time,
l want you to stop loving me.

507
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,631
l'm very independent, you know.

508
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,595
l love you, but not the way you think.

509
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,718
- How then?
- Not the way you think.

510
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,839
But you don't know what l think.
You don't know.

511
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,310
- Sure, l do.
- But you don't.

512
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,031
l want to know
what's behind your face.

513
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,995
l've looked at it for 1 0 minutes now,
and l still know nothing, nothing.

514
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,311
l'm not sad. l'm scared.

515
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,191
Sweet, gentle Patricia.

516
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:40,357
OK, then, cruel, stupid, heartless,
pathetic, cowardly, despicable.

517
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,950
You don't even how
to apply your lipstick.

518
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,997
Now you're hideous.

519
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,754
Say what you like, l don't care.

520
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,275
l'll put all this in my book.

521
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,398
- What book?
- l'm writing a novel.

522
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,348
- You?
- Why not me? What are you doing?

523
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,873
Taking off your top.

524
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,519
Not now.

525
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,753
You're a bloody pain! What is all this?

526
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,639
You know William Faulkner?

527
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,678
No, who's he?
Someone you slept with?

528
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,149
No way, Jose!

529
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,038
To hell with him, then!

530
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,553
Take off your top.

531
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,315
He's one of my favourite writers.
Have you read ''Wild Palms''?

532
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,391
Take off your top, l said.

533
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,519
Listen. The last sentence is beautiful.

534
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,634
Which would you choose?

535
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,313
Let me see your toes.

536
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,109
Toes are important in a woman.
Don't laugh.

537
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,759
Which would you choose?

538
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,559
Griefs stupid.

539
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,278
l'd choose nothing.

540
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,749
lt's not better,

541
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,876
but griefs a compromise.

542
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,917
l want all or nothing.

543
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,674
And now l know.

544
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,276
Now l do.
What are you shutting your eyes for?

545
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,115
l'm shutting my eyes tight
so everything goes black.

546
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,068
But l can't do it.
lt's never entirely black.

547
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,593
Your smile...

548
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,155
seen in profile,
it's the nicest thing about you.

549
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,197
That's you.

550
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,713
That's me!

551
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,553
We look each other in the eyes,
but what for?

552
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,397
l hate that name.
l'd like to be called lngrid.

553
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,474
Sit on your haunches.

554
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,593
What's wrong?

555
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,957
l'm looking at you.

556
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,078
The French are stupid, too.

557
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,634
l want you to stay with me.

558
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:18,235
We interrupt our programming
in order to synchronise our networks.

559
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,870
Funny, l can see
my reflection in your eyes.

560
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,918
This is a real Franco-American
reconciliation.

561
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,548
We're like happy elephants in hiding.

562
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,631
A woman's hips are touching.

563
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,631
lt's hot under here.

564
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,349
lf it was another man caressing you,
would you mind?

565
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,999
You asked me that.

566
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:38,196
Do you know a book by Dylan Thomas,
''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog''?

567
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,470
Sunday morning is most satisfyin'

568
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,155
To have a really long lie-in

569
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,512
l'm getting dressed.

570
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,632
- What time is it?
- Noon.

571
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,552
Was it good?

572
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,313
Let's stay in bed.

573
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,835
Nope, l've got to buy a dress.

574
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,356
- Got your car?
- Sure.

575
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,636
ELY. 99.84.

576
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,115
Did Antonio come by?

577
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,792
This is maddening!

578
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,758
You don't know where he is?

579
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,912
No, never mind.

580
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,593
Michel Poiccard again.

581
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,433
Want me to wear a bra?

582
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,631
Which do you like best:
my eyes, my mouth or my shoulders?

583
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,035
lf you had to choose.

584
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,390
There was no press conference.

585
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,189
No, it's at Orly in a little while.

586
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,797
l'm not much of a looker,
but l'm quite a boxer!

587
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,034
Going to your press conference?

588
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,714
l have to drop by the office first.

589
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,233
l'll come with you.

590
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,436
Pres. Eisenhower,
with Gen. de Gaulle,

591
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,513
will lay a wreath
on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

592
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,513
Were you in the army?

593
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,399
What did you do?

594
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,516
l did in the sentries.

595
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,399
- ''Did in''?
- l laid them out flat.

596
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,073
Don't, Michel!

597
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,195
l'm exhausted. l'm gonna die.

598
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,032
You're crazy.

599
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,033
Yeah, totally barmy.

600
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,633
What's ''barmy''?

601
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,153
That's me.

602
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,878
Your car's not here?

603
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,838
lt's at the garage.
l'll go pick it up now.

604
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,391
Great, a Ford!

605
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,151
- What floor?
- Fifth.

606
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,230
l got the wrong floor.

607
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,636
Scared of getting old? l am.

608
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,552
You're a dope!

609
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,873
l told you, the worst flaw is cowardice.

610
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,916
Buy me a dress at Dior's?

611
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,993
Not on your life! There are
nicer dresses at Prix Unique.

612
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,515
You don't buy dresses at Dior,
you make calls.

613
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,353
lt's the only place
where you can phone for free.

614
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,795
There are 1 2 call boxes.

615
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,439
France Soir!

616
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,999
Police Killer Still At Large

617
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,639
How long will it last?

618
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,392
Half an hour or so.

619
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,711
l'll go and see my chap, then.

620
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,116
Why did you call
your novel ''Candidate''?

621
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,638
l'm convinced that the French
will give my book

622
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,429
a cool reception
because of their prudishness.

623
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,750
Mr Parvulesco!

624
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,070
Can one still believe
in love in our time?

625
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,030
Of course, especially in our time.

626
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:40,994
What about Rilke's saying: Modern life
increasingly separates men and women?

627
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,517
Rilke was a great poet,
he was probably right.

628
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,549
Out of my way!

629
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,877
You and your Pathe-Journal!

630
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,828
Do French and American women
differ in their romantic attitudes?

631
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,752
French women

632
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,592
are totally unlike Americans.

633
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,118
The American woman dominates the man.
The French doesn't dominate him yet.

634
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,070
What's your greatest ambition?

635
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,995
Who are more moral:
unfaithful women or deserting males?

636
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,958
Unfaithful women.

637
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,714
Are women more sentimental than men?

638
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,998
Feelings are a luxury
few women can afford.

639
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,950
ls there a difference
between eroticism and love?

640
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,035
No, not really.

641
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,112
l don't think so, because...

642
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,955
eroticism is a form of love,
and vice versa.

643
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:50,351
Does the soul exist in modern society?

644
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,316
Do women have a role to play
in modern society?

645
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,712
lf she's charming and wears
a striped dress and dark glasses.

646
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,269
Casanova said that there's no woman

647
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,034
who can't be seduced
with displays of gratitude.

648
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,839
Cocteau will answer that.

649
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,788
How many men can a woman
love in a lifetime?

650
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,269
Physically, l mean.

651
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,954
More than that!

652
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,599
Miss, you're in the shot.

653
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:33,392
Two things matter in life. For men,
it's women, and for women, money.

654
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,357
You're a pessimist!

655
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,353
lf you see a pretty girl
with a rich chap, you know

656
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,876
she's nice and he's a bastard.

657
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,071
Do you like Brahms?

658
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,673
Like everyone, no.

659
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,798
- And Chopin?
- Lousy!

660
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,316
What's your greatest ambition?

661
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,028
To become immortal and then die.

662
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,677
You're Claudius Mansard?

663
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,193
Yes, Mr. Kovacs.

664
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,360
l called this morning.
l was told you'd be here.

665
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,873
Yes, Mr Kovacs.

666
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,792
Tony sent me.

667
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,197
Didn't we meet in Nice?

668
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,915
Nobody phoned you?

669
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,436
Yes. But they said
it'd be an Oldsmobile.

670
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,068
lt fell through at the last minute.

671
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,037
And so?

672
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,553
So, it's this.

673
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,512
800,000.

674
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,628
But l'll only have the money next week.

675
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,870
You bastard!

676
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,033
And you, Mr Kovacs? Who are you?

677
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,233
So what?

678
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,515
So you don't get the money now.

679
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,990
- Tough. ls it 3 yet?
- Quarter past.

680
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,957
Can l use the phone?

681
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,752
ls Antonio there?

682
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,273
He just left.

683
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,395
Bloody hell!

684
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,472
He said to meet him
at the Escale at 4.

685
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,837
The Escale at 4. OK, thanks.

686
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,353
Don't bother.
l carry my cash on me.

687
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,114
Lend me 1 0,000.

688
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,513
5000.

689
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,033
2500.

690
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,671
She's not running?

691
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,118
Hey, you!

692
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,153
You remove the distributor cap?

693
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,997
- You owe me a phone call!
- For a taxi!

694
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,676
Step on it! Step on it!

695
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,877
Never mind the pedestrians!
Just hurry up!

696
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,270
Step on it, for Christ's sake!

697
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,276
The Thunderbird's left wing torn off!
Me, not a scratch!

698
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,479
That's where l was born.

699
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,952
Look at the eyesore they built opposite!

700
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,636
Houses like that get me down.
They ruin the whole square.

701
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,998
l have a feeling for beauty, Beauty.

702
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,311
lf we're late it's your fault.

703
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,833
Certainly not.

704
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,752
Overtake that Peugeot!

705
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,273
Don't change gears!

706
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,560
Don't brake for a 4CV!
You're being overtaken by a scooter!

707
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,359
Take the next left!

708
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,909
Wait. l'll be back.

709
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,836
He left 5 minutes ago.

710
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,560
The friend who owes you money?

711
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,713
Antonio Berruti, yeah,
and it's your fault.

712
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,757
Now it's double or quits.

713
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,956
- Why?
- Tell you later.

714
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,951
Overtake that 2CV.

715
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,793
- Where you going?
- To the New York Herald.

716
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,393
Eyes on the road!

717
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,959
Why bother writing?

718
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,669
To have money and not rely on men.

719
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,991
Paris girls look like tarts
in those short dresses.

720
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,835
Makes me wanna run up behind them
and do like this...

721
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,558
Don't mind me!

722
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,795
- We'll be right back.
- OK.

723
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,837
- Not paying the fare?
- Fast!

724
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,351
- Where are we going?
- The Champs Elysees.

725
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,308
l hate taxi-drivers who are afraid
their car'll get scratched.

726
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,675
The Gestapo put up a wall here

727
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,831
so nobody could escape them.

728
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,355
l've been thinking about that girl.

729
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,635
What girl?

730
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,712
The one with that chap on the Riviera.

731
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,269
You said you admired her.

732
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,319
Yeah, an ordinary girl. That's rare.

733
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,632
Come with me to the paper?

734
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,438
No, l've a call to make.

735
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,672
l'm going to see my tailor.
l'll pick you up later.

736
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,592
Ciao, kid!

737
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,994
You're late. They're waiting.

738
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,992
Over there.

739
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,432
You speak French?

740
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,670
Do you know this man?

741
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,033
Careful, little girl,
don't mess with the Paris police.

742
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,918
Yes, it's Michel.

743
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,229
l didn't recognise him.
lt's an old photo.

744
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,473
You were seen with him
this morning just outside.

745
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,390
Who saw me?

746
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:39,032
He was driving
a Ford Thunderbird, 3382 GM 75.

747
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,109
Where is he?

748
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,157
l don't know.

749
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,875
Watch it,
watch what you say, little girl!

750
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,395
l've seen him five or six times.

751
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,714
l found him nice. l don't know
where he lives or what he does.

752
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,997
Known him long?

753
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,312
l met him 3 weeks ago in Nice.
l was on holiday.

754
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,155
He came to Paris to see someone
who owes him money.

755
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,279
- Who?
- l don't know. He had an ltalian name.

756
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,554
Think you'll see him again?

757
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:21,636
Maybe. Sometimes he calls me
and asks me out. Like this morning.

758
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,908
Got a work permit?

759
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,435
You don't want
any passport difficulties?

760
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,953
No, l don't.

761
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,157
So if you see him, here's my number.

762
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,150
Danton 01 .00.

763
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,639
President Eisenhower
is waving his arms...

764
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,356
Was that what you meant
by double or quits?

765
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,193
More or less.

766
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,510
Let's go see a western.

767
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,353
Yeah, better wait till dark.

768
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,712
Beware, Jessica

769
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,235
On the kiss's bevelled edge
Time is a void

770
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,915
Avoid, avoid
Memory's broken pledge

771
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,513
You're wrong, Sheriff

772
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,797
Your tale is noble and tragic
As the mask of a tyrant

773
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,317
No drama so perilous or magnetic
No detail can make our love pathetic

774
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,033
Hi, cutie!

775
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:37,834
Police closing in on Michel Poiccard.

776
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,154
- What's it say?
- l'm reading it.

777
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,470
The cops are stupid to be after me.

778
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,473
l'm one of the few people
who like them.

779
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,031
Let me caress you.

780
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,313
Say something!

781
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,277
- Well!
- What?

782
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,238
- So you're married.
- Show me.

783
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,357
That was long ago.

784
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,829
She was crazy. She dumped me.

785
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,036
Or l dumped her. l can't remember.

786
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,634
l really like you, Michel.

787
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,678
What's it feel like,
riding in a stolen car?

788
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,274
- And killing a policeman?
- l was scared!

789
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,113
How did they know l knew you?

790
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,273
Someone must've seen us together
and gave us away.

791
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,192
- That's very bad.
- What is?

792
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,157
Giving people away.

793
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,630
No, it's normal. lnformers inform,

794
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,313
burglars burgle,

795
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,712
murderers murder, lovers love.

796
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,590
Look, isn't the Concorde gorgeous!

797
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,355
Yes, mysterious, with all the lights.

798
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,399
l was a fool to keep this car.
Gotta switch.

799
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,518
- What?
- Switch cars.

800
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,315
Let's steal the Cadillac.

801
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,513
What about the keys?

802
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,753
You drive, l hide.
They leave the keys in the car here.

803
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,995
- What do l tell the man?
- Say goodnight... in English.

804
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,516
He won't say a thing.
The French are yellow-bellied.

805
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,033
''Yellow-bellied''?

806
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,760
Scared stiff. Are you scared?

807
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,878
lt's too late to be scared.

808
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:52,119
Michel Poiccard: arrest imminent.

809
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,072
l've just gotta find Antonio.

810
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,789
Once you look for someone,
you never find him.

811
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,069
Who was that?

812
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,038
- Step on it, poppet.
- What's ''poppet''?

813
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,837
Seen Antonio?

814
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,833
l'll tell you if l can kiss her.

815
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,514
lt's not up to me,

816
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,432
it's up to her.

817
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,520
He's with Zumbart.

818
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,353
Carl!

819
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,756
- How's things?
- Antonio's not with you?

820
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,876
There he is.

821
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,628
Who is he?

822
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,279
- Antonio?
- No, the other one.

823
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,477
Let's see those socks.

824
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,949
Silk socks with a tweed jacket!

825
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,429
- l like silk.
- Not with tweed!

826
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,313
- Hi, amigo.
- Hi, sonny.

827
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,471
l'll be off.

828
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,916
You've been looking for me?

829
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,433
Yeah, l'm in the shit.

830
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,032
Got a minute?

831
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,838
- lt's that man.
- What do l say?

832
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,479
Anything you want.

833
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,756
l'll just be a sec.

834
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,629
- What will they do?
- Take photos of her kissing the man.

835
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,395
- What for?
- Blackmail, probably.

836
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,711
Be right back.

837
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,159
Who's the chick?

838
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,710
- The thing is, l'm in love with her.
- Damn!

839
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,515
1 .3 million, can do.

840
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,114
- What's your bank?
- The B.N.C.l.

841
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,633
Let's see.

842
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,478
- What do we do?
- Dunno.

843
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,438
- Where can l reach you tomorrow?
- Dunno.

844
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,194
The hotels are crawling with tourists.

845
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,079
My friend in Montmartre has a big flat.

846
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,198
- Not Montmartre.
- No, not Montmartre.

847
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,952
Why not?

848
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,759
Too many enemies in Montmartre.

849
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,797
Try Zumbart's Swedish girl.

850
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,758
Rue Campagne Premiere?

851
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,876
Call me there tomorrow.

852
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,354
Antonio said
we could stay the night.

853
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,910
Sure. Sit down.
l'll be right with you.

854
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,793
Smile!

855
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,999
You could pose. lt pays good.

856
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,628
You have to sleep around.

857
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,598
- l was just thinking...
- What?

858
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,512
l can't decide...

859
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,352
Decide what?

860
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:01,230
l don't know.
Otherwise l wouldn't hesitate...

861
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,795
You dumped your journalist?

862
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,439
Why did you say hello?

863
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,034
To make sure l didn't love him any more.

864
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,919
You make life difficult.

865
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,470
That's it. Drop me
on the Champs Elysees?

866
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,518
What record?

867
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:42,196
Mozart's clarinet concerto.
Do you mind?

868
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,839
No, l like that one.

869
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,753
l thought you didn't like music.

870
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:51,232
This one's OK.
My dad was a clarinettist.

871
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,472
My dad was a brilliant clarinet-player.

872
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,631
Want to turn in?

873
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,836
Sleeping's so sad.

874
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,513
We have to separ.

875
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,309
- ...ate.
- ''Separ-ate''.

876
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:08,314
They say ''sleep together'',
but it's not true.

877
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,670
What is it?

878
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,953
Nothing.

879
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,952
Come here.

880
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:45,348
Go buy France Soir
and a bottle of milk.

881
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,551
What time is it?

882
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,073
Five.

883
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,475
Engaged all the time.

884
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,791

896
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,313
Thirsty?

897
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,677
Antonio's coming by. He just called.

898
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,196
We're on our way to ltaly, girlie!

899
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,435
- l can't go.
- Sure you can, l'm taking you.

900
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,637
Berruti's lending me his Simca.

901
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,711
An Amedeo Gordini lodel.

902
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,077
Michel, l called the police.

903
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:21,518
- l said you were here.
- Are you crazy?

904
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,433
No, l'm fine.

905
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,631
No, l'm not.

906
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,951
l don't want to go with you.

907
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,156
l knew it.

908
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,355
l don't know.

909
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,592
l just talked about myself,
and you, yourself.

910
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,113
l'm so stupid.

911
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,875
You should've talked about me,
and me, about you.

912
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,589
l don't want to be in love with you.

913
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:51,235
That's why l called the police.

914
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:56,520
l stayed with you
to see if l was in love with you.

915
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,513
Or if l wasn't.

916
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,633
And since l'm being cruel to you,

917
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,519
it proves l'm not in love with you.

918
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,636
Say that again!

919
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,315
And since l'm being cruel to you,

920
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,951
it proves l'm not in love with you.

921
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,998
They say there's no happy love.

922
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,072
lf l loved you...

923
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,958
lt's too complicated!

924
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:30,432
On the contrary,
there's no unhappy love.

925
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,876
l want people to let me be.

926
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,553
l'm independent.

927
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,918
- Maybe you love me.
- You think you are. You're not.

928
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,911
That's why l gave you away.

929
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,913
l'm better than you are.

930
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,516
Now you have no choice but to go.

931
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,551
You're nuts!

932
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:56,110
That's a rotten way to reason!

933
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:06,239
You're like those women
who sleep with everyone...

934
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,712
except the one man who loves them...

935
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,634
saying it's because they sleep
with everyone.

936
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,039
Why don't you go?

937
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:25,678
l've slept with lots of men.
Don't count on me.

938
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,996
What are you waiting for?

939
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,594
No, l'm staying. l'm in bad shape.

940
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,149
l prefer jail.

941
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,072
You're mad!

942
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,873
Nobody'll talk to me.

943
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,759
l can look at the walls.

944
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,273
Damn, Berruti!

945
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,673
Hey, amigo! l'll just park.

946
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,557
- Cops are coming.
- Your money!

947
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,995
The American gave me away.

948
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,718
- Get in!
- No, you go!

949
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,998
- Get in!
- No, l'm staying.

950
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,350
l've had enough.

951
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,919
l'm tired.

952
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,479
l want to sleep.

953
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,959
You're nuts!

954
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,635
Damn the police. l'll save my neck.

955
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:22,351
l shouldn't be thinking of her
but l can't help it.

956
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,398
Want my automatic?

957
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,555
- Don't be stupid!
- Get lost!

958
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,240
You're a real louse.

959
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,319
What did he say?

960
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,075
He said you're a real louse.

961
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,432
What's a ''louse''?

962
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,433
