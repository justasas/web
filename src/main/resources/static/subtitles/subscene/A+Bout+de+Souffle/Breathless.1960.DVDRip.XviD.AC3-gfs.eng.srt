DEDICATED TO
MONOGRAM PICTURES

2
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:37,064
Breathless

3
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,499
After all, I'm an asshole.

4
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,936
After all, yes, I've got to. I've got to!

5
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,475
Michel...

6
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:56,649
Take me with you.

7
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,249
- What time is it?
- 10:50.

8
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,748
No. Ciao!

9
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,922
Gotta make tracks, Max!

10
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:26,868
If he thinks he's gonna pass me
in his crappy Renault!

11
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,814
I collect the dough,

12
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,323
I ask Patricia if it's yes or no,

13
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,223
and then...

14
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,104
Nothing like the countryside.

15
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,685
I really like France.

16
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,789
If you don't like the shore...

17
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,592
if you don't like the mountains...

18
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,334
if you don't like the city...

19
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,802
then get stuffed!

20
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,973
Little girls hitchhiking!

21
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,675
I'll charge a kiss per mile.

22
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,051
The short one's not bad. Nice legs.

23
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,160
Yeah, but the other one...

24
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,728
Oh, hell, they're both dogs.

25
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,014
Nothing like sunshine.

26
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,721
Women drivers
are cowardice personified.

27
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,197
Pass him!

28
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,529
Oh, shit, it's the roadwork!

29
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,379
Never brake.

30
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,953
As old man Bugatti said:
"My cars are made to run, not stop."

31
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,118
Shit! The pigs!

32
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,036
Contact's gone!

33
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,274
This is the pits!

34
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,453
Hold it right there!

35
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,410
- Miss Franchini's room?
- She isn't here.

36
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,814
- She does live here?
- But she's out!

37
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,388
Girls never have cash.

38
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,724
Coffee.

39
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,833
- How much for ham and eggs?
- 180 francs.

40
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,044
Make it one.

41
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,482
Gotta get a paper. Be right back.

42
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,235
Can I come in?

43
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,268
How's it going, precious?

44
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,070
No jacket?

45
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,441
It's in my Alfa Romeo.

46
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,743
- Want breakfast at the Royal?
- I'm late.

47
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,420
Gotta be at the TV station at 9:10.

48
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,057
It's torn.

49
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,566
What've you been up to?

50
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,200
Nothing much. Traveling.

51
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,012
- What's new in the Quarter?
- Don't know.

52
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,412
- You don't go out?
- Dancing sometimes.

53
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,576
Still in the movies?

54
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,654
No. You gotta sleep around.

55
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,687
Do you recollect Enrico?

56
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:17,386
"Remember" or "recall."
But not "recollect."

57
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,896
I work with him at the station.
As script girl.

58
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,634
When I was broke in December,
I was assistant on a picture.

59
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,930
At Cinecittà!

60
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,936
- You?
- Yep, me.

61
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,836
Ever been a gigolo?

62
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,067
Why?

63
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,939
Just asking.

64
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,246
I wouldn't mind.

65
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,015
Call me back in a few minutes.

66
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,957
Is Gaby back from Spain?

67
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,191
- He bought the Café Pergola.
- He did?

68
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,698
Great.

69
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,129
The black paint's a stupid idea.

70
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,563
- What's that say?
- "Why?"

71
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,369
But I switched to Luckies.

72
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,202
Can you lend me 5,000 francs
till noon?

73
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,244
I should've known.

74
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,745
You're rotten, Michel.

75
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,045
I'll pay you back at noon.

76
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,313
Anyway, I don't have that much.

77
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,421
- Here's 500 if you want.
- Keep it.

78
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,618
- So no breakfast at the Royal?
- I'm really late.

79
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,521
Is Mr. Tolmachoff here?

80
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,224
He's here, but he's not here.

81
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,398
Seen Patricia?

82
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,816
Come with me to Rome?

83
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,843
It's crazy, but I love you.

84
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,217
I wanted to see
if I'd be glad to see you again.

85
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,449
Where you been? Monte Carlo?

86
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,029
No, Marseilles.
There was a guy I had to see.

87
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,062
I tried calling you Monday.

88
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,791
I was out of town Monday and Sunday.

89
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,134
- I'll take one.
- That's nice of you.

90
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,838
What are you doing here?
I thought you hated Paris.

91
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,678
No, but I've got enemies here.

92
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,285
So you're in danger?

93
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,013
Yeah. Will you come to Rome with me?

94
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,885
To do what?

95
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,150
We'll see.

96
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,885
No, I've got lots to do here.

97
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,428
You going up or down the Champs?

98
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,601
- What's the "Champs"?
- The Champs-Élysées.

99
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,172
- I gotta be on Avenue George V.
- See you, then.

100
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,308
Come on, walk me.

101
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,808
Just to the corner.

102
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,686
- Take it back. No horoscope!
- What's "horoscope"?

103
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,885
The future. I wanna know
the future. Don't you?

104
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,654
Sure.

105
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,134
- What is it?
- Nothing. Just looking at you.

106
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,411
You're mad I left without a good-bye.

107
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,547
No, I was furious
because I was sad.

108
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,875
It's nice to wake up next to a girl.

109
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,454
Are you staying in town?

110
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,621
Yeah, I have to see a guy
who owes me money.

111
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,625
Then I have to see you.

112
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,354
You don't have to.

113
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,123
Why?

114
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,835
There are prettier girls than me here.

115
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,631
No. It's weird.
I've slept with two girls since you.

116
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,240
We didn't jive at all.

117
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,802
You didn't "jive"?

118
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:31,005
They were pretty,
but we didn't jive. It was sad.

119
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,209
So will you come to Rome?
I'm fed up with France.

120
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,944
I can't, Michel.

121
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,148
I have to enroll at the Sorbonne
or my parents will stop sending money.

122
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,987
- I've got money.
- We only had three nights together.

123
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,890
No, five.

124
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,061
- Why don't you wear a bra?
- That's no way to talk.

125
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,565
Okay, sorry!

126
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,001
What time is it? See you later?

127
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,834
Not later. Tonight. Okay?

128
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,343
- Where?
- Here.

129
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,656
Live dangerously until the end!

130
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,508
Have you anything against youth?

131
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,372
Sure do. I prefer old people.

132
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,230
Police Killer Identified

133
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,745
Is Mr. Tolmachoff in?

134
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,346
At the airline desk.

135
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,496
- Hey, amigo.
- Hey, sonny.

136
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,328
You the one who came by at 10?

137
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,867
Yeah, for my money.

138
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,834
It's ready for you.

139
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,612
- How's life?
- I got bored down south.

140
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,847
I came up to see a girl. And you?

141
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,457
I'm getting out of here.
I'm rusting away.

142
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,094
Better rusted than busted.

143
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,800
Over here.

144
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,399
Have the envelope I gave you?

145
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,911
Why'd the jerk cross it?

146
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,678
Sign it over to someone else.

147
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,414
Not to me.
I blew my last cent at the races.

148
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,854
And your pal, Bob Montagné?

149
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,120
- He's in the pen, the idiot.
- No kidding.

150
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,730
There's Berruti, but I don't trust him.

151
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,958
I thought he was your pal.

152
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:37,260
Is he back?

153
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,905
Yes, I saw him
in Montparnasse last night.

154
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,672
What's his number?

155
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,850
Élysées 9984.

156
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,678
Can I call from here?

157
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,620
Who's the girl you came for?

158
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,350
A New Yorker.

159
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,619
Pretty?

160
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,161
She's funny. I like her.

161
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,733
Élysées 9984?

162
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,371
I'd like to speak to Antonio.

163
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,268
I'll call back.

164
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,513
He's out. I'll try somewhere else.

165
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,775
- Bye, sonny.
- Ciao, amigo.

166
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,687
Inter-Americana Agency?

167
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,862
Yes, this is it.

168
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,960
Do customers have mail
forwarded here?

169
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,629
Know a certain Michel Poiccard?

170
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,803
Also goes by the name
of Laszlo Kovacs.

171
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,341
Ask the gentleman over there.

172
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,420
If it isn't Tolmachoff!

173
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,324
Hello, Inspector.

174
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,762
In the travel business now?

175
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,765
As you can see.

176
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:25,003
Remember how you ratted
on your friend Bob?

177
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,871
What if I did?

178
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,877
You're going to do it again.

179
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,347
Michel Poiccard, 5 feet 9.

180
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,919
Brown hair.
Former Air France steward.

181
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,182
Has his mail sent here.

182
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,791
Yes, I know him.

183
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,690
He been around lately?

184
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,169
Has anyone been to see
Mr. Tolmachoff recently?

185
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,470
Yes, just five minutes ago.
A fairly tall man.

186
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,510
Christ Almighty!

187
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,874
"Accessory to murder" --
mean anything to you?

188
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,285
The Harder They Fall

189
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,079
Bogey...

190
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,521
- I saw a man die.
- How'd he die?

191
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,129
In an accident.

192
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,299
Take me out to dinner?

193
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,739
Let me make another call first.
Wait for me?

194
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,535
Call from the restaurant.

195
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,273
I'll just be a second.

196
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,645
The French always say one second
when they mean five minutes.

197
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,440
Where we going?

198
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,371
Anywhere. The Latin Quarter.

199
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,171
- Sleep with me tonight?
- I don't know.

200
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,838
- Don't you like it with me?
- Sure, I do.

201
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:57,147
I just read something neat.
About a bus conductor.

202
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:01,884
He stole five million to seduce a girl,
posing as a rich impresario.

203
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,030
He took her to the Riviera.
They blew the wad in three days.

204
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,962
The guy didn't cop out.
He told her,

205
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,433
"It's stolen money, I'm a hood,
but I like you."

206
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:20,678
What's great is that she stuck by him.
She said, "I like you, too."

207
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,471
They came back to Paris

208
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,775
and were nabbed trying to rob
some fancy villas.

209
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,953
She stood lookout.
That was sweet of her.

210
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,581
Excuse me, got a light?

211
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,057
Here! Go buy yourself a matchbook.

212
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,059
I totally forgot!

213
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,630
- I have an appointment.
- Who with?

214
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:46,270
A journalist on the Champs-Élysées.
We're going to a press conference.

215
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,870
Where? Now?

216
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,339
None of your business.
You can really be annoying.

217
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,573
So you're leaving me?

218
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,749
But I'll see you tomorrow.

219
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,247
Not tomorrow.
Tonight, Patricia.

220
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,352
I told you I can't.

221
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,579
Why are you so mean?

222
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,518
Any taxis around?

223
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,354
I'm parked by the Opera. Want a lift?

224
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,325
What happened to the Ford?

225
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,434
It's in the garage.

226
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,928
Let me stay with you.

227
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,470
I've got a headache.

228
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,734
We won't have sex.
I just want to be with you.

229
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:28,276
That's not it, Michel.

230
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,350
- Why are you so sad?
- Because I am.

231
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,387
That's silly.

232
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,557
Why are you so sad?

233
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,860
Should I use "vous" or "tu"?

234
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,794
No difference.
But I can't do without you.

235
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,092
Yes, you can.

236
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,827
Maybe. But I don't want to.

237
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,441
Just look at that swell Talbot.
A 2.5 liter.

238
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,736
- You're a guy who...
- What?

239
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,607
Oh, I don't know.

240
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:09,651
Look at me.
I forbid you to meet this guy.

241
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,730
Woe is me!

242
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,558
I love a girl with a pretty neck,

243
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,634
pretty breasts, a pretty voice,

244
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,303
pretty wrists,

245
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,870
a pretty forehead,

246
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,303
and pretty knees...

247
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:37,276
But she's such a coward.

248
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,083
- It's right here. Stop.
- Let me park first.

249
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,482
Don't bother.

250
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,785
Get lost!

251
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,459
I never want to see you again.

252
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,392
Get lost!

253
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,364
You make me want to puke.

254
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,150
It'd be a shame
if that happened to you.

255
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,782
We'll see.

256
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,022
What's wrong?

257
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:58,590
If I could dig a hole
to hide in, I would.

258
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:03,734
Do like elephants do.
When they're sad...

259
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:17,846
Let me tell you a story.

260
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,347
It'll take your mind off things.

261
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,076
There's this girl I know.

262
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,155
The other day, I figured,
"I'll ask her to sleep with me."

263
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,759
It had never occurred to me before.
We met for lunch.

264
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:34,421
I wanted to say,
"We're friends. Let's sleep together."

265
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:39,661
I don't know why,
but it completely slipped my mind!

266
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,803
Later I suddenly remembered
and sent her a telegram saying:

267
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,468
"I forgot to suggest
that we sleep together."

268
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,446
Three hours later I get
a message back, saying:

269
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,142
"What an amazing coincidence!

270
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,686
I was thinking exactly the same thing!"

271
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,234
- This the late edition?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,278
Where's my key?

273
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,541
You must've left it in the door.

274
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,886
What the heck!

275
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,022
What are you doing here?

276
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,493
The Claridge was booked up.

277
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,933
So I came here.
I took the key downstairs.

278
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,798
There are other places
than the Claridge.

279
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:04,270
I always stay at the Claridge.

280
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,036
You're crazy.

281
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,406
Don't make such a face.

282
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,906
It doesn't suit you.

283
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,886
- What's "making a face"?
- Going like this.

284
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,623
It suits me just fine.

285
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,129
You're even crazier than me.

286
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,927
Goddammit.

287
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,805
I always fall for girls
who aren't my type.

288
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:42,005
Did you notice I followed you
last night? Answer me.

289
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,646
What's wrong?

290
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,751
Leave me alone. I'm thinking.

291
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,245
What about?

292
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,983
What's horrible is, I don't even know.

293
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:57,991
Well, I do.

294
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,528
No, nobody does.

295
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:04,099
You're thinking about last night.
Yes, you are.

296
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:09,433
Last night I was furious,
but now I couldn't care less.

297
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,633
I'm not thinking about anything.

298
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:20,884
I'd like to think about something,
but I can't seem to.

299
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:25,249
Well, I'm tired, very tired,

300
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,152
and I'm going back to sleep.

301
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:38,199
- Why are you looking at me?
- Because I am.

302
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,329
- You should've stayed with me.
- I couldn't.

303
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,567
You should've told the guy
you couldn't see him.

304
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,508
I had to.
He's getting me articles to write.

305
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,205
It's really important for me.

306
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,545
What's important
is going to Rome with me.

307
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,244
Maybe. I don't know.

308
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,088
Did you sleep with him?

309
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,187
I bet you did.

310
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,364
No. He's really sweet.

311
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:11,524
He said we'd sleep together
someday, but not now.

312
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,931
But he doesn't even know me.

313
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,971
Not you. Him and me.

314
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,735
We had a drink in Montparnasse.

315
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:23,436
I was there, too. At what time?

316
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,674
I don't know. We didn't stay long.

317
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,853
Why'd you come here, Michel?

318
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,984
Because I want to sleep
with you again.

319
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,855
That's hardly a reason.

320
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,857
Sure it is. It means I love you.

321
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,364
But I don't know if I love you yet.

322
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,534
When will you know?

323
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,599
Soon.

324
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,637
What's that mean, "soon"?
In a month, a year?

325
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,541
Soon means soon.

326
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,516
A woman will never do in eight seconds

327
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,982
what she'll gladly do eight days later.

328
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,656
It's all the same,
eight seconds or eight days.

329
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,355
Why not eight centuries?

330
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,494
No, eight days is fine.

331
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,867
Women always do things halfway.

332
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,366
It gets me down.

333
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,134
Why won't you sleep with me?

334
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,833
Because I'm trying to find out

335
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:30,947
what it is that I like about you.

336
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,945
I want us to be
like Romeo and Juliet.

337
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,611
That's just like a girl!

338
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:42,487
See? You said last night you couldn't
live without me, but you can.

339
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:47,097
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet,
but you can.

340
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:51,428
No, I can't live without you.

341
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,235
That's just like a guy!

342
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,302
Give me a smile.

343
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,109
I'll count to eight.

344
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,750
If by eight you haven't smiled,
I'll strangle you.

345
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,786
Two...

346
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,788
Three...

347
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,855
Four, five, six...

348
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,887
Seven...

349
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,153
Seven and a half...

350
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,831
Seven and three quarters.

351
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,665
You're such a coward.
I bet you're gonna smile.

352
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,675
Enough games for today.

353
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,778
You're a coward. Too bad.

354
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:39,677
Why do you say that?

355
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,215
You get on my nerves.

356
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,250
You do, too.

357
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,019
I'm not a coward.

358
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,020
What makes you think I'm scared?

359
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:51,093
If a girl says everything's fine
then can't even light her cigarette,

360
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:54,059
it means she's scared of something.

361
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,894
I don't know of what, but she's scared.

362
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,495
Have one.

363
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,935
None of those Chesterfields.

364
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,803
Hand me my jacket.

365
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,203
- This pocket?
- Give!

366
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,280
This your passport?

367
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,747
No, my brother's. Mine's in the car.

368
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,420
But it says Kovacs here.

369
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,614
Oh, yeah? He's not my real brother.

370
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:24,761
My mom was divorced
by the time he was born.

371
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,338
See? I'm not scared.

372
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,408
- I never said you were.
- You bet, pet.

373
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:47,479
But you wish you'd said it.
And now you're annoyed. You can't.

374
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,313
I'm not talking to you anymore.

375
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,922
Do you ever think about death?

376
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,691
I do, all the time.

377
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,402
What?

378
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,231
Say something nice.

379
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,699
Like what?

380
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,636
I don't know.

381
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,910
Then neither do I.

382
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:19,272
I like your ashtray.

383
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,349
It's Swiss.

384
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,485
My granddad had a Rolls-Royce.
Great car!

385
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,887
Never had to raise the hood
in 15 years!

386
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,727
Seen my new poster?

387
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,797
Come here!

388
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,370
Come here, for chrissake!

389
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:44,268
It won't do here. Where can I hang it?

390
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,638
Why'd you slap me
when I looked at your legs?

391
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,145
It wasn't my legs.

392
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,275
It's exactly the same thing.

393
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:01,481
The French always say things
are the same when they're not at all.

394
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,192
I've thought of something nice.

395
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:06,863
What?

396
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:11,634
I want to sleep with you again
because you're beautiful.

397
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,236
I'm not.

398
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,030
Then because you're ugly.

399
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,071
Is it the same?

400
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,477
Yeah, kid, it's the same.

401
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,208
You're a liar, Michel.

402
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,444
No, lying's stupid.

403
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:34,056
It's like with poker.
It's better to tell the truth.

404
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:38,456
The others think you're bluffing,
and that's how you win.

405
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,364
What's wrong?

406
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,228
I'll stare at you
until you stop staring at me.

407
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,872
Me, too.

408
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,600
I'll hang my poster in the bathroom.

409
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,601
Can I make a call?

410
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,303
It's not bad here.

411
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,744
Just fine.

412
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,946
You like this poster?

413
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,784
It's okay.

414
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,030
Renoir's a really great painter.

415
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,392
I said, it's okay!

416
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,595
Think she's prettier than me?

417
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:01,775
When you're scared or surprised,
or both at once,

418
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,810
there's a funny glint in your eyes.

419
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,141
So what?

420
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,149
I wanna sleep with you again,
because of that glint.

421
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,625
Mind if I piss in the sink?

422
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,625
Guess what I'm going to say.

423
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,798
No idea.

424
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,860
I'm pregnant, Michel.

425
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,932
You heard me.

426
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,609
Whose is it? Mine?

427
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,778
I think so.

428
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,040
Have you seen a doctor?

429
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,113
Yesterday.

430
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:43,219
I have to go back Thursday
for the tests.

431
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,719
You should've been more careful!

432
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,029
Get me Élysées 9984.

433
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,939
Is Antonio there?

434
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,884
You don't know if he's coming back?

435
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,650
I'll call again.

436
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,533
Élysées 2532.

437
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,934
I'm calling the guy
who owes me money.

438
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,476
Mr. Tolmachoff, please.

439
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,176
Hey, sonny.

440
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,415
I couldn't find Berruti.

441
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,722
I wandered
around Montparnasse all night.

442
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,396
The police?

443
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,864
Thanks. Ciao, sonny.

444
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,868
Shit!

445
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,272
- What?
- I slipped.

446
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,875
Heard the one
about the condemned man?

447
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:25,621
As he's climbing the scaffold,
he slips and says, "That figures!"

448
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,530
Up close, you look like a Martian.

449
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,560
Because my head's in the clouds.

450
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,736
Some idea, having a kid!

451
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,666
But it's not sure.

452
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,102
I wanted to see what you'd say.

453
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:47,277
- Take your clothes off.
- What for?

454
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,412
You Americans are so dumb.

455
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,978
I don't see why.

456
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,812
You adore La Fayette
and Maurice Chevalier.

457
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,420
And they're the dumbest French!

458
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,988
I'm making another call.

459
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,161
Belle Épine 3526.

460
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,523
Patricia, come here!

461
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,198
Mr. Mansard?

462
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:18,034
Will he be in this afternoon?
Tell him I'll come by.

463
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,876
I'm a friend of Tony's.
From Marseilles.

464
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,673
I've got an American.

465
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,820
An American?

466
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,749
Laszlo Kovacs.

467
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:39,423
Not you. My American car.

468
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,835
I can't reach the guy
who owes me. What a drag!

469
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,634
Do you prefer records or the radio?

470
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,366
Quiet, I'm thinking.

471
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,557
I know them all by heart.

472
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,498
- How old are you?
- I'll put the radio on.

473
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,167
I'm 20.

474
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,303
You don't look it.

475
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,668
Why don't you like music?

476
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,899
It depends what kind.

477
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,905
Come on, Patricia, come to Italy.

478
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,913
What's the point of studying
at the Sorbonne?

479
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,954
You never took any exams.

480
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:44,385
Sure, the baccalaureate.
Then I packed it in.

481
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,290
What's "packed it in"?

482
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,055
I did other stuff.

483
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,323
Like what?

484
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,795
I sold cars.

485
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,764
Here, in Paris?

486
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,536
In New York.

487
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:01,411
You slept with a lot of guys?

488
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,341
Not all that many.

489
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,514
How many?

490
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,248
How about you?

491
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,783
Not so many either.

492
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:22,031
Know where I'd like to live? Mexico.

493
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,063
I hear it's really great.

494
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,705
When I was a kid my dad would say,
"We'll go next Saturday."

495
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,374
But he'd always forget.

496
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,941
No, Mexico doesn't grab me.

497
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,376
I bet it's not all that great.

498
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,948
People are such liars.

499
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,120
It's like Stockholm. You keep hearing,

500
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:49,384
"Swedish girls are terrific.
I laid three a day. Go."

501
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,562
I went. It's not true.

502
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:56,232
Swedish girls don't act
the way they do here.

503
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,630
And most of them are dogs
like Parisian girls.

504
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:03,000
No, Swedish girls are very pretty.

505
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:06,335
It's a myth.

506
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:12,981
One or two maybe, just like in Paris
or London, but not all of them.

507
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,346
The cities where the girls are pretty,

508
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:20,649
not gorgeous,
but like you, charming,

509
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:24,954
girls who rate eight on a scale of 10,

510
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,824
because they have a certain something...

511
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:35,269
aren't Rome or Paris or Rio,
but Lausanne and Geneva.

512
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,807
Say something nice, too.

513
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,672
I don't know what, either.

514
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,884
Would you let another guy caress you?

515
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:59,826
You know, you said I'm scared.
It's true, I'm scared.

516
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,897
Because I want you to love me.

517
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:08,700
But at the same time,
I want you to stop loving me.

518
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,898
I'm very independent, you know.

519
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:18,342
I love you, but not the way you think.

520
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,107
Then how?

521
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,575
Not the way you think.

522
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:25,881
But you don't know what I think.
You don't know.

523
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,321
- Sure I do.
- No. You can't.

524
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,924
I want to know what's behind your face.

525
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,696
I've looked at it for 10 minutes now,
and I still know nothing, nothing.

526
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,134
I'm not sad, but I'm scared.

527
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,403
Sweet, gentle Patricia.

528
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:54,039
Then mean, stupid, heartless,
pathetic, cowardly, despicable.

529
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:59,348
You don't even know
how to put on your lipstick.

530
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,080
Now you're hideous.

531
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,427
Say what you like, I don't care.

532
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,028
I'll put all this in my book.

533
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,223
- What book?
- I'm writing a novel.

534
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,959
- You?
- Why shouldn't I?

535
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,432
What are you doing?

536
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,900
Taking off your top.

537
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,698
Not now.

538
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:21,275
You're a pain! What is all this?

539
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,940
You know William Faulkner?

540
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,308
No, who's he?
Someone you slept with?

541
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,851
Hardly, sweetie pie.

542
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,885
Then he can go to hell!

543
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,352
Take off your top.

544
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:38,324
He's one of my favorite writers.
Have you read <i>The Wild Palms?</i>

545
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,554
I said no! Take off your top.

546
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:44,791
Listen. The last sentence is beautiful.

547
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,441
Which would you choose?

548
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,205
Let me see your toes.

549
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,648
Toes are important in a woman.
Don't laugh.

550
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:05,912
Which would you choose?

551
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,455
Grief's stupid.

552
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,754
I'd choose nothing.

553
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,656
It's not better...

554
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,625
but grief's a compromise.

555
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,664
I want all or nothing.

556
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,927
And now I know.

557
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:24,165
That's it.
Why are you shutting your eyes?

558
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:28,208
I'm shutting them tight
so everything goes black.

559
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:32,212
But I can't do it.
It's never entirely black.

560
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,213
Your smile...

561
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,613
seen in profile,
is the nicest thing about you.

562
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,653
That's you.

563
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,685
That's me!

564
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:56,870
We look each other in the eyes,
but what for?

565
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:05,741
I hate that name.
I'd like to be called Ingrid.

566
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,785
Sit on your haunches.

567
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,985
What's wrong?

568
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,957
I'm looking at you.

569
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,657
The French are stupid too.

570
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,270
I want you to stay with me.

571
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:39,279
<i>We interrupt our programming</i>
<i>to synchronize our transceivers.</i>

572
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:49,624
Funny... I can see myself in your eyes.

573
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,954
This is Franco-American
rapprochement.

574
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,654
We hide like happy elephants.

575
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:57,458
A woman's hips are touching.

576
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,693
It's hot under here.

577
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,986
If it was another man caressing you,
would you mind?

578
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:18,586
You asked me that.

579
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,987
<i>And now it's time for</i>
Music While You Work...

580
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,338
So that's that.

581
00:49:56,426 --> 00:50:01,830
Do you know a book by Dylan Thomas,
<i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog?</i>

582
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:08,296
<i>On Sunday morning,</i>
<i>It's most satisfyin'</i>

583
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,905
<i>To enjoy a long lie-in</i>

584
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,542
I'm getting dressed.

585
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:16,569
What time is it?

586
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,372
Noon.

587
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,608
Was it good?

588
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,651
Let's stay in bed.

589
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,380
Nope, I have to buy a dress.

590
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,717
Got your car?

591
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,393
My car? Sure.

592
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,738
Élysées 9984.

593
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,782
Did Antonio come by?

594
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,821
This is maddening!

595
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,828
You don't know where he is?

596
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,199
No, never mind.

597
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,095
Michel Poiccard again.

598
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,104
Want me to wear a bra?

599
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:31,180
Do you prefer my eyes,
my mouth or my shoulders?

600
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,189
If you had to choose?

601
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,757
There is no press conference?

602
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:46,025
There is. At Orly airport.

603
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:51,599
I'm not much of a looker,
but I'm quite a boxer.

604
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,240
Going to your press conference?

605
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,073
I have to drop by the office first.

606
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,808
I'll come with you.

607
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:05,078
<i>President Eisenhower,</i>
<i>with General De Gaulle,</i>

608
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:09,190
<i>will lay a wreath</i>
<i>on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</i>

609
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,791
Were you in the army?

610
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,828
What did you do?

611
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,490
I bumped off sentries.

612
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:18,963
"Bumped off"

613
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,602
I laid them out like this.

614
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,795
Don't, Michel!

615
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,301
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna die.

616
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,310
You're crazy.

617
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,340
Yeah, totally bonkers.

618
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,508
What's "bonkers"?

619
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,278
That's me.

620
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,473
Your car's not here?

621
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:05,075
It's at the garage.
I'll go pick it up now.

622
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,332
Swell, a Ford!

623
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,583
- What floor?
- Sixth.

624
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,533
I got the wrong floor.

625
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,508
- Are you scared of aging? I am.
- You dope!

626
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:47,148
I told you,
the worst flaw is cowardice.

627
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,216
Buy me a dress at Dior?

628
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:56,449
No way! There are
nicer ones at the five-and-ten.

629
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,356
You don't buy dresses at Dior,
you make calls.

630
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,156
It's the only place
where you can call for free.

631
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,856
There are 12 phone booths.

632
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,899
<i>France-soir!</i>

633
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,482
Thank you, sir.

634
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,961
Police Killer Still At Large

635
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,135
How long will it last?

636
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:24,938
Half an hour or so.

637
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,616
I'll go see my man, then.

638
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:51,470
Why did you call your novel <i>Candida?</i>

639
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,579
I'm convinced that the French
will give my book

640
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,739
a cool reception
because of their prudishness.

641
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,918
Mr. Parvulesco!

642
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,621
Can one still believe in love in our time?

643
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,927
Of course, especially in our time.

644
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:21,898
Was Rilke right to say, "Modern life will
increasingly separate men and women"?

645
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,473
Rilke was a great poet,
so he was probably right.

646
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,107
Out of my way!

647
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,182
You and your Pathé-Journal!

648
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:42,555
Are French women romantically
different from American women?

649
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,351
French women

650
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,495
are totally unlike American women.

651
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,561
The American woman
dominates the man.

652
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,461
The French woman
doesn't dominate him yet.

653
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,197
What's your greatest ambition in life?

654
00:57:57,407 --> 00:58:01,468
Which is more moral: an unfaithful woman
or a man who walks out?

655
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:04,406
An unfaithful woman.

656
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,316
Are women more sentimental
than men?

657
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:12,112
Feelings are a luxury
few women indulge in.

658
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:19,557
Is there a difference
between eroticism and love?

659
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,533
No, not really.

660
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,726
I don't think so, because...

661
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:31,373
eroticism is a form of love,
and vice versa.

662
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:34,968
Does the soul exist in modern society?

663
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:44,679
Do women have a role to play
in modern society?

664
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:50,189
If they're charming and wear
striped dresses and dark glasses.

665
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,953
Casanova said that there's no woman

666
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:55,756
who can't be seduced
with displays of gratitude.

667
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,832
See Cocteau's
<i>Testament of Orpheus</i>.

668
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,698
How many men can a woman
love in a lifetime?

669
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,874
Physically, I mean.

670
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,274
More than that.

671
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,106
Miss, you're in the frame.

672
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:20,119
Two things matter in life. For men,
it's women, and for women, money.

673
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,052
See? You are a pessimist.

674
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:25,259
If you see a pretty girl
with a rich man, you know

675
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:28,555
she's nice and he's a bastard.

676
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,397
Do you like Brahms?

677
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,071
Like everyone, no.

678
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,103
- And Chopin?
- Makes me want to puke!

679
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,067
What's your greatest ambition?

680
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:50,279
To become immortal, and then die.

681
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,458
You Claudius Mansard?

682
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,530
Yes, Mr. Kovacs.

683
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,361
I called this morning.
I was told you'd be in.

684
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,163
Yes, Mr. Kovacs.

685
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,398
Tony sent me.

686
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,502
Didn't we meet in Nice?

687
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,510
Nobody phoned you?

688
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:57,083
Yes. But they said
it'd be an Oldsmobile.

689
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,811
It fell through at the last minute.

690
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,581
So?

691
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,059
So it's this one.

692
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,001
800,000.

693
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:24,242
But I can't pay you till next week.

694
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,875
You're a bastard!

695
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,916
And you, Mr. Kovacs? What are you?

696
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,612
So what?

697
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,857
So you don't get the money now.

698
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:41,428
- Tough. Is it 3:00 yet?
- Quarter past.

699
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,622
Can I use your phone?

700
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,113
- Is Antonio there?
- <i>He just left.</i>

701
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,077
Goddammit!

702
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,086
<i>He said to meet him at L'Escale at 4:00.</i>

703
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:12,250
Four o'clock at L'Escale. Okay, thanks.

704
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,263
Don't bother. I carry my cash on me.

705
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,536
Lend me 10,000.

706
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:24,406
5,000.

707
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,770
2,500.

708
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,547
It's not running?

709
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,017
Hey, you!

710
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,858
You remove the distributor cap?

711
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:48,661
Pay for the call!

712
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,423
Pay for my taxi!

713
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,164
Step on it! Step on it!

714
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,464
Never mind the pedestrians!
Just move it!

715
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,233
Step on it, for chrissake!

716
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,972
The Thunderbird's fender torn off!
Me, not a scratch!

717
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,812
That's where I was born.

718
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:13,113
Look at the eyesore
they built opposite!

719
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:18,585
Buildings like that get me down.
They ruin the block.

720
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:24,024
I have a feeling for beauty, beautiful.

721
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:28,231
Go through Chatelet.
It's your fault if we're late.

722
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:29,927
No, it isn't.

723
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,004
Pass that Peugeot!

724
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,539
Don't shift gears!

725
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:39,181
Braking for a 4CV!
That scooter just passed you!

726
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,509
Take the next left.

727
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,682
Stop here. Be right back.

728
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,750
He left five minutes ago.

729
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,443
The friend who owes you money?

730
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:22,454
Antonio Berruti, yeah. It's your fault.

731
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:24,950
Now it's double or nothing.

732
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,527
- Why?
- Later.

733
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,664
Pass that 2CV, pops.

734
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,391
- Where you going?
- To the <i>Herald</i>.

735
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:33,967
Eyes on the road!

736
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,569
Why bother writing?

737
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:39,263
To have money and not rely on men.

738
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:42,933
Parisians look like tarts
in those short dresses.

739
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:46,876
Makes me wanna run up behind them
and do like this...

740
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,074
Don't mind me!

741
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,479
Stop here!

742
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:01,492
- Be right back.
- Okay.

743
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,790
- Not paying?
- Quick!

744
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,342
- Where are we going?
- The Champs-Élysées.

745
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:18,377
I hate cabbies who worry
about scratching the bodywork.

746
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,213
The Gestapo put up a wall here

747
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,476
so nobody could get away.

748
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:26,018
I've been thinking about that girl.

749
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,314
What girl?

750
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:30,788
The one with that guy on the Riviera.

751
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:33,325
You said you admired her.

752
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:37,260
Yeah, a normal girl. That's rare.

753
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,002
Come with me to the paper?

754
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,899
No, I have a call to make.

755
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,234
I'm going to see my tailor.
I'll pick you up later.

756
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,343
Ciao, kiddo!

757
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:11,261
You're late. They're waiting.

758
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,358
Over there.

759
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,747
You speak French?

760
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:05,580
You know this man?

761
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:27,869
Careful, kid.
You can't fool the Paris police.

762
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,772
Yes, it's Michel.

763
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,182
I didn't recognize him.
It's an old photo.

764
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:39,648
You were seen with him
this morning just outside.

765
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:40,822
Who saw me?

766
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:45,517
He was driving
a Ford Thunderbird 3382 GM75.

767
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:48,790
Where is he now?

768
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,057
I don't know.

769
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:55,832
Watch what you say, kid.

770
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:58,472
I've seen him five or six times.

771
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:03,611
I found him nice. I don't know
where he lives or what he does.

772
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,613
Known him long?

773
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:11,916
I met him in Nice last month.
I was on vacation.

774
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:15,887
He came to Paris to see someone
who owes him money.

775
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,059
Who?

776
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,387
I don't know.
He had an Italian name.

777
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,658
Think you'll see him again?

778
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:30,897
Maybe. Sometimes he calls me
and asks me out. Like this morning.

779
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:36,638
Got a work permit?

780
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,146
You don't want any passport problems?

781
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:41,316
No, I don't.

782
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:44,975
So if you see him, here's my number.

783
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:51,418
Danton 0100.

784
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:42,497
<i>President Eisenhower</i>
<i>is waving to the crowds...</i>

785
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,761
Was that what you meant
by double or nothing?

786
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,900
More or less.

787
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,838
Let's go see a Western.

788
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:58,843
Yeah, better wait till dark.

789
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,189
<i>Beware, Jessica</i>

790
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,761
<i>On the kiss's beveled edge</i>
<i>Time is a void</i>

791
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:19,627
<i>Avoid, avoid</i>
<i>Memory's broken pledge</i>

792
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:24,432
<i>You're wrong, sheriff</i>

793
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,905
<i>Your tale is noble and tragic</i>
<i>Like the mask of a tyrant</i>

794
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:32,740
<i>No drama so perilous or magnetic</i>
<i>No detail can make our love pathetic</i>

795
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:44,252
Hey, cutie!

796
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:58,737
Police closing in on Michel Poiccard...

797
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:01,603
- What's it say?
- I'm reading it.

798
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,869
The cops are stupid to be after me.

799
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:07,105
I'm one of the few people
who likes cops.

800
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,910
Let me caress you.

801
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,047
Say something!

802
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,247
- Wow!
- What?

803
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,018
- So you're married.
- Show me.

804
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:24,789
That was ages ago.

805
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,525
She was a wacko. She dumped me.

806
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,636
Or I dumped her. Don't remember.

807
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:32,363
I'm really fond of you.

808
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,543
What's it feel like,
riding in a stolen car?

809
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,235
- And killing a policeman?
- I was scared.

810
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,972
How did they know I knew you?

811
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:44,983
Someone must've seen us together
and informed on us.

812
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,512
- That's horrible.
- What is?

813
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,782
Informing on people.

814
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:53,120
No, it's normal. Informers inform,

815
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:54,795
burglars burgle,

816
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:59,331
murderers murder, lovers love.

817
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,297
Look, isn't the Concorde gorgeous!

818
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,708
Yes, mysterious, with all the lights.

819
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:14,679
I was a fool to keep this car.
Gotta switch.

820
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,851
- What?
- Switch cars.

821
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,197
Let's steal the Cadillac?

822
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:37,705
What about the keys?

823
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:42,138
You drive, I hide.
They leave the keys in the car here.

824
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:50,746
- What do I tell the man?
- Say good night, in English.

825
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:54,616
That'll shut him up.
The French are yellow-bellied.

826
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,085
"Yellow-bellied"?

827
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,987
Scared stiff. You scared?

828
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:02,163
It's too late to be scared.

829
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:18,945
Michel Poiccard: Arrest Imminent

830
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,525
I just gotta find Antonio.

831
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:34,184
Once you look for someone,
you never find him.

832
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,233
Who was that?

833
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,364
- Step on it, poppet.
- What's "poppet"?

834
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:05,787
Have you seen Antonio?

835
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:08,360
I'll tell you if I can kiss her.

836
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,356
It's not up to me.

837
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,031
It's up to her.

838
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,535
He's with Zumbach.

839
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,344
Carl!

840
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,985
- How's life?
- The same. Antonio here?

841
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,712
There he is.

842
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,752
- Who is he?
- Antonio?

843
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:40,223
No, the other one.

844
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:46,299
Let's see those socks.

845
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:48,867
Silk socks with a tweed jacket!

846
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,631
- I like silk.
- Not with tweed!

847
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:55,573
- Hey, amigo.
- Hey, sonny.

848
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,301
I'll be off.

849
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:01,347
You been looking for me?
You called several times.

850
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:05,111
Yeah, I'm in the shit. Goddammit!

851
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,649
Got a minute?

852
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:09,551
- See that guy?
- What do I say?

853
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,248
Anything you want.

854
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,451
I'll just be a sec.

855
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:17,763
- What will they do?
- Take photos of her kissing the guy.

856
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:21,197
- What for?
- Blackmail, probably.

857
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,617
Be right back.

858
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,221
Who's the chick?

859
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:48,590
- To make things worse, I love her.
- Damn!

860
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,781
1 .3 million. Can do.

861
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,787
What's the bank?

862
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:16,150
- B.N.C.I.
- Let me see.

863
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:20,455
What do we do?

864
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:22,129
Don't know.

865
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,322
- Where can I reach you tomorrow?
- Don't know.

866
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,503
The hotels are crawling with
goddamn tourists.

867
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,195
My friend in Montmartre
has a big place.

868
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:34,705
- Not Montmartre.
- Not Montmartre, he says.

869
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,241
Why not?

870
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,005
Too many enemies in Montmartre.

871
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,348
Try Zumbach's Swedish girl.

872
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,383
Rue Campagne-Première?

873
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,577
Call me there tomorrow.

874
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,738
Antonio said we could sleep here.

875
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:10,776
Sure. Sit down.
I'll be right with you.

876
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,908
Smile!

877
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,651
Why not pose? Pay's good.

878
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,259
You have to sleep around.

879
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:28,025
I was just thinking...

880
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:31,028
- What?
- I'm not sure.

881
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,962
About?

882
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:37,036
I don't know. Otherwise I'd be sure.

883
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:46,080
You dump your journalist?

884
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:48,444
Why'd you say hello?

885
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,681
To make sure
I didn't love him anymore.

886
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,117
You complicate your life.

887
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:57,251
That's it.
Drop me on the Champs-Élysées?

888
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,804
What are you playing?

889
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:20,778
The "Clarinet Concerto" by Mozart.
Do you mind?

890
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,540
No, I like that one.

891
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,481
I thought you didn't like music.

892
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:29,054
This one's okay.
My dad was a clarinetist.

893
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:33,153
My dad was a great clarinet player.

894
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,956
Want to go to bed?

895
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:38,155
Sleeping's so sad.

896
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:39,890
We have to separ.

897
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:43,036
- ...ate.
- "Separate."

898
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:47,199
You say "sleep together," but you don't.

899
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,880
What is it?

900
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,585
Nothing.

901
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,592
Come here.

902
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:25,474
Go buy a <i>France-soir</i>
and a bottle of milk.

903
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:35,050
What time is it?

904
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,085
Five o'clock.

905
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:44,154
Still busy.

906
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,231
- What?
- Nothing.

907
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:55,841
<i>France-soir!</i>

908
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,978
I'm looking at you.

909
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:06,216
It's your lucky day. Buy a ticket.

910
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:07,911
- A Scotch.
- Don't have any.

911
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,852
Make it coffee.

912
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:17,090
Danton 0100?

913
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,435
Inspector Vital, please.

914
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,844
Patricia Franchini.

915
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:36,784
I've just seen the man
you've been looking for.

916
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:40,679
He's at 11, rue Première-Campagne.

917
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:44,921
Yes. 11, rue Campagne-Première.

918
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:41,743
Thirsty?

919
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,809
Antonio's coming. He just called.

920
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:49,616
We're going to Italy, kid.

921
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:53,390
I can't go.

922
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:55,790
Sure you can. I'm taking you.

923
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,759
Berruti's lending me his Simca Sport.

924
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:04,260
- A Gordini engine.
- Michel, I called the police.

925
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:06,370
I said you were here.

926
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:09,202
What! Are you crazy?

927
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:12,238
No, I'm fine.

928
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:15,940
No, I'm not fine.

929
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:19,052
I don't want to go away
with you now.

930
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:20,979
I knew it.

931
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:22,723
I don't know.

932
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:26,325
I just talked about myself,
and you, yourself.

933
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:27,859
I'm so stupid.

934
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:31,863
You should've talked about me,
and me, about you.

935
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,002
I don't want to be in love with you.

936
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:39,538
That's why I called the police.

937
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:46,076
I stayed with you
to make sure I was in love with you.

938
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:49,114
Or that I wasn't.

939
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:54,547
And since I'm being mean to you,

940
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:57,554
it proves I'm not in love with you.

941
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,488
Say that again!

942
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:03,624
And since I'm being mean to you,

943
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:07,131
it proves I'm not in love with you.

944
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,138
They say there's no happy love.

945
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,671
If I loved you...

946
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:16,637
It's too complicated!

947
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:20,611
On the contrary, there's no unhappy love.

948
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,584
I want people to let me be.

949
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,815
I'm independent.

950
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:31,082
- Maybe you love me.
- You think you are. You're not.

951
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,487
That's why I turned you in.

952
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:36,027
I'm better than you are.

953
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:39,800
Now you have no choice but to go.

954
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,393
You're crazy!

955
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:47,732
That's a pathetic argument.

956
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:57,742
You're like the girl
who sleeps with everyone...

957
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:02,221
except the one man who loves her...

958
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:06,719
saying it's because she sleeps
with everyone.

959
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,830
Why don't you go?

960
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:18,767
I've slept with lots of men.
Don't count on me.

961
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,673
What are you waiting for?

962
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:25,209
No, I'm staying. I'm in bad shape.

963
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:27,847
I prefer prison.

964
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:29,846
You're mad!

965
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,486
Nobody'll talk to me.

966
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:38,886
I can look at the walls.

967
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,726
Damn, Berruti!

968
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,958
Hey, amigo! I'll just park.

969
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:51,272
- The cops are coming.
- Your money!

970
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,804
The American girl turned me in.

971
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:55,771
- Get in!
- No, you go!

972
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:59,310
- Get in!
- No, I'm staying.

973
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:04,510
I'm fed up.

974
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:06,276
I'm tired.

975
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:07,852
I want to sleep.

976
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,523
You're nuts!

977
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:12,318
Damn the police. I'll save my neck.

978
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:17,956
I shouldn't be thinking of her
but I can't help it.

979
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:20,324
Want my pistol?

980
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:25,770
- Don't be stupid!
- Get lost!

981
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:31,263
Makes me want to puke.

982
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:45,210
What did he say?

983
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:48,678
He said you make him want to puke.

984
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:56,251
What's that mean, "puke"?
