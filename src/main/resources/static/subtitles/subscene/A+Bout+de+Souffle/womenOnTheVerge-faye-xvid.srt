1
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:50,478
Women on the Verge
of a Nervous Breakdown

2
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,590
Ivan and I moved here
a few months ago.

3
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,957
The world was falling apart...

4
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,828
...and I wanted to save it
and save myself.

5
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,027
I felt like Noah.

6
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,962
In the coop on my terrace...

7
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,404
...I wanted to save
a couple of each species.

8
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,273
Anyway...

9
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,573
...I couldn't save
the couple I cared about most:

10
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,114
Ivan and me.

11
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,275
Pepa, darling...

12
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,649
...I never want to hear you say,
"I'm unhappy."

13
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,016
Yours, Ivan.

14
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,779
Life means nothing without you.

15
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,156
Will you marry me?

16
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,627
A million nights
wouldn't be enough.

17
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,700
I can't live without you.

18
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,738
I love you,
desire you, need you.

19
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,266
That night in the jungle
was heaven.

20
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,312
Let's get married again.

21
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,577
You're the geisha of my life.
Sayonara.

22
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,083
With you by my side,
I don't need success.

23
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,020
I'm willing
to accept you as you are.

24
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,760
Baby, some things
are unmistakably American.

25
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,929
I'm all yours.

26
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,766
- I accept you as you are.
- Great.

27
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,611
How many men
have you had to forget?

28
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,952
Say something nice.

29
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,186
Lie.

30
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,692
Tell me you've been
waiting for me...

31
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,800
...and you'd die
if I didn't return.

32
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,735
Say you still love me
as I love you.

33
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,411
Thanks.

34
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,647
Thanks a lot.

35
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,436
Call these two numbers.

36
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:47,405
First, I'll call one...

37
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,548
...then the other.

38
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,216
Pepa.

39
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,724
Pepa, sweetheart,
did you oversleep?

40
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,953
We started without you.

41
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,899
Listen. Pack all my stuff
in a suitcase.

42
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,194
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

43
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,736
I'll come and pick it up
and say goodbye...

44
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,736
...but I'll call you before.

45
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:18,070
If you don't want to see me,
just leave it downstairs.

46
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,779
Thanks for being so understanding.

47
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,575
I don't deserve it.

48
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,408
I'll call later, darling.

49
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,913
Ivan?

50
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,634
"EXA." Hello.

51
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,136
Is Ivan there?

52
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:48,637
He just called me.

53
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,935
Sorry. He just left.

54
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,604
But your director is here
having a fit because you're not here.

55
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,750
Yes. Here he is.

56
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,583
I'm sorry, German.

57
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,419
I couldn't sleep,
so I took a pill.

58
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,120
Don't worry. Just come now.

59
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,764
I'll be right there.

60
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,959
I have to stop by
for some test results on my way.

61
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,468
Okay, but make it quick.

62
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,138
Some people are lucky.
I'll call your cab now.

63
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,637
Who wanted a taxi?

64
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:34,018
Whoever asked for a taxi,
come to the front desk.

65
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,052
Don't smoke...

66
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,918
...eat properly,
and you'll be fine.

67
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:55,807
Mr. Salcedo,
please pick up the telephone.

68
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,574
It's about time. Studio seven.

69
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,041
Did Ivan call again?

70
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,511
No. Forget him, honey.

71
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,707
I'm working on it.

72
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,249
Just give me time.

73
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,080
And cut the microphone.

74
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,689
Give me that paper!
Give me that!

75
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,103
- I'm really sorry, guys.
- Okay, let's go.

76
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,114
Arturo, do you take...

77
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,773
...Eugenia as your wife...

78
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,749
...and promise to be faithful,
for richer or for poorer...

79
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,321
...in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

80
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,583
Yeah, I think so.

81
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,063
And you, Eugenia. Eugenia?

82
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,889
Yes, Father?

83
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,793
Do you take Arturo
as your husband?

84
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,265
Sure. Of course I do.

85
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,066
What God has united,
let no man tear asunder.

86
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,537
Can we kiss now, Father?

87
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,803
My child, you mustn't trust any man.

88
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,505
Not even my husband?

89
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,243
You can't be too careful.

90
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,587
Fine. We'll check it later.

91
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,417
Roll it.

92
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,185
- You start rehearsing.
- Thank you.

93
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,177
Here. Drink.

94
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,788
I'm not thirsty.

95
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,686
It'll help you to sleep.

96
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,692
I already tried it,
and it didn't help.

97
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,194
How many men
have you had to forget?

98
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,357
As many as the women
you remember.

99
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,866
Don't go.

100
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,367
I haven't moved.

101
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,438
Say something nice.

102
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,476
What shall I say?

103
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,341
Lie. Tell me you've
waited for me forever.

104
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,713
I've waited for you
all these years.

105
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,216
Say you'd die
if I didn't return.

106
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,652
I'd have died
if you hadn't returned.

107
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,316
Say you still love me
as I love you.

108
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,327
I still love you as you love me.

109
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,863
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

110
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,197
Pepa, are you okay?

111
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,379
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

112
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,257
You've got some nerve.

113
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,526
Call this number, please.

114
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,863
You have no right, Pepa.

115
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,369
Just dial the number.

116
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,006
You're making a fool of yourself.

117
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,608
Well, a little more won't hurt.

118
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,540
- Were you crying?
- Yes.

119
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,113
There! You see? I knew it, Pepa.

120
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,877
Dial! They won't like
you holding up our work.

121
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:31,547
Yes, right away.
Excuse me! At your service!

122
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,055
My coffee can wait.

123
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,955
I've had enough breakfasts
in my time.

124
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,959
The other woman's number.

125
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,293
She'll never learn. Not her.

126
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,301
She should have by now.
Not her.

127
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,132
No way.

128
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,979
- Who's this?
- Pepa Marcos. Is Ivan there?

129
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,376
- Forgive my bothering you.
- Not as sorry as I am.

130
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,213
I must speak to him. It's urgent.

131
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,752
How dare you call here?

132
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,119
Don't yell at me.
I just had a fainting spell.

133
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,283
I don't care if you drop dead!

134
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,986
Look, Ivan and I are finished.

135
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,427
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off yourself!

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,968
Just tell him to call me.

137
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,963
Pepa, I didn't know
you had fainted.

138
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,472
Poor thing.

139
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,303
This is too much!

140
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,105
Don't you dare defend her!

141
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,769
- Mom.
- Yes?

142
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,279
We should talk.

143
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,442
Not now. I'm doing my eye lines,
and you make me nervous.

144
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,485
Okay. Then later?

145
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,180
Later. Later.

146
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,592
What's wrong?

147
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,859
That bitch Ivan sleeps with
had the nerve to call me.

148
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:51,127
He should be more discreet.

149
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,737
Why haven't I thrown those out?

150
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,669
Dad wouldn't let you.

151
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,469
I could sell them at the store,
you know?

152
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,475
I like wearing them.

153
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,477
It's as if time stood still.

154
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,708
Well, it hasn't stood still.

155
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,414
Don't be rude.
Let her wear what she wants.

156
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,422
Go on. Humor her.
She'll never get well.

157
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,423
Let me help you.

158
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,392
- Hold that.
- Let's see. There.

159
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,501
Like it?

160
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,502
You look terrific.

161
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,234
You're a great liar, Dad.
That's why I love you.

162
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,110
You think it's too dark?

163
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,409
- No.
- Neither do I.

164
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,393
- Am I interrupting something?
- No. How are you?

165
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,791
- Fine.
- How's the penthouse?

166
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,421
- Are you enjoying it?
- It's great, but I'm here to sublet it.

167
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,625
We'll get a good price for it.

168
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,067
Good. I'll want to rent an apartment.

169
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,072
Can I make a call?
I've been out all day.

170
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,073
What type of apartment?

171
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,338
With a terrace, but not so big.

172
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,918
- Yours is number seven Montalban?
- Yes, seventh floor.

173
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,816
220 square yards
including the terrace.

174
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,420
Everybody just loved
your scale model.

175
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,928
It turned out well.

176
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,725
The jerk hasn't called.

177
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,868
- How much is that?
- 200 pesetas.

178
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,365
- Is Isabel here?
- She's busy. Can I help you?

179
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,069
- I have to see her.
- One moment.

180
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,110
Hi.

181
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,451
You want to try a facial?

182
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,250
- I can't now.
- It's free.

183
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,619
They're giving a demonstration.

184
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,557
I need sleeping pills.

185
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,288
I've run out.

186
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,561
- You have the prescription?
- No. I'll bring it later or tomorrow.

187
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,931
I can't sleep without them.

188
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,767
- Okay.
- Thanks.

189
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,747
- She's not much in person.
- She's skinnier than on TV.

190
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,762
Pepa, honey, are you there?

191
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,704
If I can't reach you,
I'm going to get worried.

192
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,207
So am I.

193
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,279
I've had no luck
reaching you today, so...

194
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,106
Well?

195
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,774
I feel you're avoiding me.

196
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,218
Such bullshit.

197
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,050
I'll keep trying until I get you.

198
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,488
- I may get lucky.
- Sure.

199
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,220
I really want to talk to you.

200
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,229
- I miss you.
- I noticed.

201
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,560
Well, take care.

202
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,566
See you later.

203
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,705
Asshole.

204
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,106
This is Juan
at the real estate agency.

205
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,504
Tomorrow I'm sending a couple
to see your apartment.

206
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,168
Try to be there in the morning.
Thank you.

207
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,571
I'm sick of being good.

208
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,663
I shouldn't smoke.

209
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,777
I'm finally getting rid of this shit!

210
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,842
And this dumb flower!

211
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,552
Who'd think of giving a duck
as a present?

212
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,056
Only you.

213
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:25,390
But now I'll get rid of it all.
And of you!

214
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:51,149
"Something's come up
that concerns both of us.

215
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:55,776
I must talk to you before you leave."

216
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,112
Follow that cab!

217
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,157
I thought this only happened
in the movies.

218
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,056
WELCOME TO MAMBO TAXI

219
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,099
MAGAZINES FOR RENT

220
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,498
Help yourself.
It's on the house.

221
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,299
Thanks. Just follow that cab.

222
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,271
Don't worry. It's under control.

223
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,074
Do you mind the Mambo?

224
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,374
I've got everything.
Heavy metal, rock, soul...

225
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,518
...cumbias, even sevillanas.

226
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,052
Salsa, techno-pop...

227
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,688
...whatever you like.

228
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,290
- You really like Mambo?
- I love Mambo.

229
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,586
Yes, the Mambo...

230
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,423
...goes best with this decor.

231
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,998
You're that TV actress.

232
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:21,663
You play the killer's mother.

233
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,468
How about an autograph?

234
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,612
It's for my girlfriend.
Could you make it personal?

235
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,442
- What's her name?
- Azucena.

236
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,210
THANK YOU FOR SMOKING

237
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,959
- It stopped.
- What's the address?

238
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,727
Thirty-eight Almagro,
but I don't know what floor.

239
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,236
She waved.

240
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,071
Do you think she's on to us?

241
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,072
I don't care.

242
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,234
Where to now?

243
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,539
Montalban, and thank you.

244
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,451
Ladies, there's something
for you to lean on.

245
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:54,156
Hope it does you more good
than it did me.

246
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,392
Here's your food,
and that's to sleep on.

247
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,163
You can shit on it all you like.

248
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,898
Hey. Jump here. Jump!

249
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,736
She won't jump. She hates it.

250
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,709
Well, back to my waiting.

251
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,395
Number 38 Almagro.

252
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,273
Number 38 Almagro.
Let's see.

253
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,439
Almagro, Almagro,
Almagro.

254
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:49,075
Thirty-one, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38.

255
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,146
410-0430.

256
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,682
Of course!

257
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,889
Of course. It's the same one
who insulted me this morning.

258
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,560
Hello.

259
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,902
I'm the mother
of the notorious "Crossroads Killer."

260
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,910
When my son comes home
after one of his famous crimes...

261
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,446
...his clothes are just filthy.

262
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,578
Where are the clothes
your son wore...

263
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,880
At the time of the murder?

264
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,893
Right here. Sparkling clean.

265
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,595
- No trace of blood.
- Or guts.

266
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,097
Unbelievable.

267
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,828
Ecce Homo. It's unbelievable.

268
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,857
A group of armed Shiites
was captured here in Madrid today...

269
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:13,300
...according to police sources.

270
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:18,308
A local Shiite spokesman
living in Madrid...

271
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:23,140
...stated that the commando group
was acting on its own...

272
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:27,615
...without any connection
to the Shiite community.

273
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,649
The same police sources...

274
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,984
...promise to release
additional information...

275
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,990
...within a few hours...

276
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,289
...after the interrogations
are completed.

277
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,790
Oh, my book!

278
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:15,124
Ivan, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.

279
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,861
Leave a message
telling me where and when.

280
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,998
I'm going out
to look for you now. Bye.

281
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,771
It's me, Candela.
I've got to see you.

282
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,711
I'm going out. Call me later.

283
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,751
- I'm in trouble.
- So am I. Goodbye.

284
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,823
Pepa! Damn it, I need you!

285
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,373
- Pepa, it's me.
- That woman!

286
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,240
Pepa, answer.

287
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,382
I'm in big trouble.

288
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,551
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

289
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,154
- What are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

290
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,298
Well, make it!

291
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,667
- Your mother's too much.
- I'm sorry, Marisa.

292
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,829
- And that slut in the window!
- What slut? Where?

293
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,170
Weren't you going to use the phone?
Why don't you use it?

294
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:13,776
Let's go.

295
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,641
Gather everything and let's go.

296
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,975
"Something's come up
that concerns us both.

297
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:59,055
I must talk to you
before you leave."

298
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,124
Throw that away!

299
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,651
God, I hope he called.

300
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,696
Pepa, it's 5:00 A.M.

301
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,494
I'm across from your place,
and you're still not home.

302
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,431
I don't know which end is up
anymore!

303
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,343
I can't explain over the phone.

304
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,844
What a pest!

305
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,210
I'll tell you one thing...

306
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,411
I don't understand,
because if you had a problem...

307
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,490
You'll feel guilty about this!

308
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,165
- It's you.
- I called a million times.

309
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,170
You're a drag!

310
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,275
Don't say that, or I'll leave.

311
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,274
Come on in.

312
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,845
I've been out all night.

313
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,345
So have I.

314
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,847
Let's have some coffee.

315
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,350
- Going somewhere?
- No. Ivan's leaving me.

316
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,354
- We're doing great.
- My life's a mess.

317
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,855
Mine too.

318
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,290
- Problems at work?
- No. I couldn't tell you on the phone.

319
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,295
The phone! I just ripped it out!

320
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,729
Damn! I'll have to call
the phone company.

321
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,461
Can I stay here?

322
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,468
I'm in big trouble, Pepa!

323
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,598
Fix the coffee, then we'll talk.
You're a pain today!

324
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,371
What?

325
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,947
Don't call me a pain!
I'm feeling very vulnerable.

326
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,444
My God.

327
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,560
Looks like the work of terrorists.

328
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,459
Oh, the phone...

329
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,897
This just isn't normal.

330
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,964
God, the cops. I'm dead.

331
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,139
Hello.

332
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,180
Open up.
We know you're in there.

333
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,187
- What do you want?
- To see the apartment.

334
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,688
- Which one?
- This one.

335
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,521
- Why?
- To rent it.

336
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,959
The real estate agency sent us.

337
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,689
In that case...

338
00:33:56,267 --> 00:34:00,431
Come in. The owner
will be back in a minute.

339
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,474
- Carlos.
- Yes, honey?

340
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,805
It's too high.

341
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,811
Darling, it's a penthouse.

342
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,644
- And expensive.
- Super-expensive.

343
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,412
But it's a great location.

344
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:20,318
I want a real house,
and this is not a real house.

345
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,981
The girl is right.

346
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,390
Don't call me a girl.

347
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,331
Carlos.

348
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,991
Yes, my love?

349
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,001
You call this great too?

350
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,503
Christ.

351
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,502
Pepa is really something.

352
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,477
Let's go. Come on.

353
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,683
Drop that! You're a cop, right?

354
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,790
My Carlos a cop?
Very funny!

355
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,289
I'm no cop.

356
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,950
Isn't that your father?

357
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,790
Nice people don't touch
what is not theirs.

358
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,295
Why is this here?

359
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,797
I don't know.

360
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,300
- Do you know her?
- That's Pepa.

361
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,132
You know Pepa?

362
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,274
Not personally, no.

363
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,806
Well, here I am.

364
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,979
You know who I am?

365
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,143
Did you see the bed?

366
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,808
I think so, ma'am.
You know who I am?

367
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,615
Since last night.
But don't call me ma'am.

368
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,322
Ivan sent you for his bag?

369
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,485
- No, the realtor sent us.
- What a coincidence.

370
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,825
I'm glad to meet you anyway.

371
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,331
- This is Marisa.
- Who?

372
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,833
Oh, hello.

373
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,402
I'm his fiancée.

374
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,335
Very nice.
I'm his father's ex-lover.

375
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,839
Pepa, listen...

376
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,340
This is Candela.

377
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,172
Pleased to meet you.

378
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,335
Carlos, please.

379
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,449
Pardon the mess.
My life's been hectic lately.

380
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,450
Can you fix telephones?

381
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,612
I can try.

382
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,882
Come with me.

383
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,984
This one's out of order...

384
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,995
...and I'm expecting a call
from your dad.

385
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,996
Candela, make some coffee.

386
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,327
We have to go.

387
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,332
Yeah. Good idea.

388
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,471
Don't be rude.
This is my house.

389
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,630
We've got to talk.

390
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,297
It can't be that urgent!

391
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,307
- Have you any tools?
- Yes, in the kitchen.

392
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,275
I'll go get them.

393
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,844
Is this any time for repairs?

394
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,985
Don't you recognize her?

395
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:33,282
She was in the phone booth
last night.

396
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,992
I hadn't noticed.

397
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,495
If you don't want me here, say so.

398
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,565
Who says I don't?

399
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,861
I just learned
that my ex-lover has a son.

400
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,698
And he's here.

401
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,499
Shouldn't he come first?

402
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,574
But I've got a big problem.

403
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,903
Okay, we'll talk.

404
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,604
Let me know when we're leaving.

405
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,273
It won't take long.

406
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,918
Here.

407
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,945
Where's Ivan?

408
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,453
I don't know.

409
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,616
Why doesn't he call?
I need to talk to him.

410
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,625
I don't see him very much.

411
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:15,630
Don't lie.
He's taking a trip with your mom.

412
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,362
My mother thinks
he's going with you.

413
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,870
Then it's someone else.

414
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,874
So that's why
he didn't sleep at his studio!

415
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:31,845
- How do you know?
- I spent all night keeping watch.

416
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,347
You must think I'm crazy.

417
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,954
No. You're just nervous
from a lack of sleep.

418
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,817
You didn't know about me?

419
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,152
Never. I had no idea.

420
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:44,317
Ivan never tells me anything.

421
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,326
I just find things out.

422
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:50,661
Last night,
when I saw your picture...

423
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,133
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

424
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,272
- That's how I knew.

425
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:59,267
He never says anything,
never admits anything...

426
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,604
...never criticizes.

427
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,112
Do you think I didn't know
he was cheating?

428
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,116
Sure, but I put up with it.

429
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,188
I tried talking to him civilly,
but it didn't work.

430
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:17,125
So I begged him not to lie
about important things...

431
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,856
...and to tell me
if he stopped loving me.

432
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:25,493
Last week, I finally got him
to admit he didn't love me.

433
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,528
It was like pulling teeth.

434
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:33,143
Thanks for listening,
since your father wouldn't.

435
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,907
Waiting for his call
had me ready to choke myself...

436
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,106
...with the telephone cord.

437
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,684
- So I ripped out the phone.
- You did right.

438
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:46,016
She's gonna jump!

439
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,885
Your friend's jumping!

440
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,125
She jumped!

441
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,257
Help!

442
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,491
Carlos, be careful!

443
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,605
Don't let go of me, Pepa!

444
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,608
Oh, my God! I can't do it.

445
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,746
Come on! Pull!

446
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,452
You could have killed yourself!

447
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,927
That was the idea!

448
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,133
I'm desperate.

449
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,794
So am I, and I don't go
jumping off terraces.

450
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,802
Young people don't know
how to fight for things.

451
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:41,809
You think life is all pleasure.

452
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,469
Well, it isn't.

453
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,411
You have to suffer a lot.

454
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,486
Pepa, please.
This isn't the right time.

455
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,918
Yes. I'm sorry.

456
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,614
It's because you scared me.

457
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,352
- Ivan...
- Yes?

458
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:01,123
I mean Carlos. Bring me
my tranquilizers from the kitchen.

459
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,165
I'm in big trouble.

460
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,333
I can see that.

461
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,843
Carlos, do you love me?

462
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,072
Please, not now.

463
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,845
Okay, what's wrong?

464
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:28,014
Three months ago,
I spent a weekend with a guy.

465
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:33,027
I didn't know his name or anything,
but after he left...

466
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,688
...I couldn't get him out of my mind.

467
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,356
What happened that weekend?

468
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,369
Nothing special.
We fucked the whole weekend.

469
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,873
Just thinking about it
gives me goose bumps.

470
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:49,035
It was like a revelation.

471
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,478
Like making love
for the first time.

472
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,584
I loved it.

473
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,723
Sex means a lot at your age.

474
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,827
Because he's like a terrorist.

475
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,929
He's more intense
than other guys.

476
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,633
I knew he'd be back,
and I'd agree to anything.

477
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,666
He came back?

478
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,635
Two weeks ago,
with two more guys.

479
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,537
- You let them all stay?
- They were with him.

480
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:23,342
- They took advantage.
- Wait, wait.

481
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,347
I noticed
something weird about them...

482
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,350
...and he confessed
that they were Shiite terrorists.

483
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,852
I flipped. I really did.

484
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:35,355
I knew it could be dangerous,
but I didn't think about it.

485
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,188
What's worse, they had weapons...

486
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,353
...and were planning
to attack somewhere.

487
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,192
Then I said to him:

488
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,358
"You should have
told me about this."

489
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,527
That's when I realized it was a ploy.

490
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,572
He didn't love me. He used me.

491
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,274
Gazpacho.

492
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,479
You didn't call the cops?

493
00:41:58,649 --> 00:41:59,946
Delicious.

494
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:04,110
How could I?
I was a hostage in my own house.

495
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,552
- They were arrested yesterday?
- Yes.

496
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:11,491
- The ones on TV?
- I threw out all their stuff...

497
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,493
...but if they confess
where they were living...

498
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,962
If they're tortured,
they might tell.

499
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,761
They probably won't tell.

500
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,337
But if they do, the cops will
want me for collaborating...

501
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,804
...and you for not alerting them.

502
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,035
In my house,
I collaborate with whomever I want.

503
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,180
I didn't know where to go.

504
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,009
I couldn't face my folks.

505
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,617
It's bad enough
that I became a model.

506
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,516
You need to see a lawyer.

507
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,022
I'll arrange for that.
You can't leave now.

508
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,490
- Go to Paulina Morales.
- The feminist?

509
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,630
A feminist?

510
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,028
As a woman,
she'll take a personal interest.

511
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,567
I'll go change.
Then give me her address.

512
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,603
Why are men like that?

513
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,981
I really don't understand.

514
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:11,485
I couldn't stand to be
with a man right now.

515
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,555
That's all I needed!

516
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,335
Help me!

517
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,166
- What happened?
- Nothing. She fell asleep.

518
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,672
So suddenly?

519
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:35,710
The strangest things
can happen suddenly.

520
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,177
You should know, Candela.

521
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,180
It's true.

522
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,682
But a minute ago...

523
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:45,185
A minute ago
she wanted to go home...

524
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,517
...but since you ignored her...

525
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,818
...she got depressed
and had some gazpacho.

526
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,125
That made her fall asleep?

527
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,824
Yes. It was spiked with barbiturates.

528
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,734
Sorry.

529
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,702
We could call a doctor.

530
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:08,802
- What kind of barbiturates?
- Morphidal.

531
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,539
- How many?
- Twenty-five or thirty.

532
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:14,445
She'll have a good sleep.

533
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,066
Why did you do that?
Were you trying to kill yourself too?

534
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,832
It was for your dad.
He loves gazpacho.

535
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,337
It's no excuse...

536
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:42,002
...but after waiting for hours,
I just lost control.

537
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,010
That's what happened to me.

538
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,149
It could happen to anyone.

539
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,349
Don't get me wrong.

540
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:57,119
I didn't want to kill him.
Just to make him stay.

541
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,457
I meant to throw it, but...

542
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,462
I understand perfectly.

543
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,295
Thanks. The lawyer's address?

544
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,300
Thirty-one Castellana.

545
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,302
Do you mind staying?

546
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,805
The house is so full of women.

547
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:15,467
- I'll stay as long as you like.
- Thanks. And fix the phone?

548
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,979
- Are you okay?
- A bit shaken, but...

549
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,310
Don't let her near the ledge.
See you later.

550
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,282
Forget it.

551
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,963
Hi, Ana.

552
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,668
Look what fell down from the sky.

553
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,504
It's mine. Thanks.

554
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,373
It seemed strange. Just one.

555
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,447
Be more careful!

556
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,107
Ana was arguing
with her boyfriend...

557
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,947
...and it almost hit her head.

558
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,125
- You again!
- Hope you don't mind.

559
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,891
Thirty-one Castellana.

560
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,301
I'm glad to see you.

561
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,803
My girlfriend loved the autograph.

562
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:21,104
When I tell her I saw you again,
she'll think we...

563
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,525
Do you have eyedrops?

564
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,136
No. Sorry.

565
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,605
We could buy some.

566
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,037
That's okay.

567
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,145
Why didn't I think of eyedrops?

568
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,281
What a dope!

569
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,915
It's working.

570
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,125
Forget about them.

571
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:16,630
But they're hijacking
the 10:00 p.m. Stockholm flight...

572
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,792
...and taking it to Beirut
to free some Shiite prisoners.

573
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:24,132
That flight will be fully booked.
We must report it.

574
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,208
Then the cops will get me too!

575
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,303
I'll talk fast
so they can't trace the call.

576
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,005
Yeah. You have a way with words.

577
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,615
Police precinct. Hello.

578
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,327
Tonight's 10:00 p.m. Flight...

579
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,487
...to Stockholm...

580
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,156
...will be hijacked
by Shiite terrorists.

581
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,563
Thanks.

582
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,784
Here we are.

583
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,618
Don't tell anyone I cried.

584
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,623
It'll be our secret.

585
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,261
Good.

586
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:27,767
- Here?
- Where it says "sign."

587
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,641
Is Paulina Morales in?

588
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,140
She's not seeing anyone
this afternoon.

589
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,474
It's urgent. It won't take long.

590
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,116
Come on. You can arrange it.

591
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,617
- Okay. Come on.
- Thanks.

592
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,949
See you later.

593
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,394
Wait here.

594
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,598
I'm coming.

595
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,099
Can I use the phone?

596
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,736
Okay.

597
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:12,104
Is Paulina there?

598
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,909
Ivan?

599
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,244
I'm going crazy.

600
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,296
"Stockholm."

601
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,601
You can go in.

602
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,920
- Of all the nerve!
- She said I could come in.

603
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,253
I'm in a hurry.

604
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:01,386
Don't worry.
This won't take long.

605
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,497
May I sit down?

606
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,499
Go ahead.

607
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,501
What's the problem?

608
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,664
A friend of mine is in trouble.

609
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,900
A "problem."

610
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:17,143
She got involved
with a Shiite terrorist.

611
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,310
I'm dying to smoke. May I?

612
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,956
The shoe is hers.

613
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,927
Anyway, he showed up
with two more Shiites.

614
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:33,255
Three Shiites.

615
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,194
All three just moved in.

616
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,197
Now they've been arrested...

617
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,928
...and she's scared shitless.

618
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,536
So she needs a lawyer.

619
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,732
Why come to me?

620
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,400
- You're a feminist.
- So?

621
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,771
This is clear-cut chauvinism.

622
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:55,247
I'm going on a trip.
I'll recommend a colleague.

623
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,580
There's not much to be done.

624
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,746
She must turn herself in,
go to jail...

625
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:04,052
...and let the jury decide her case.

626
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:08,890
- I don't understand.
- She's committed a crime.

627
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:13,695
Her only crime was falling in love
and being afraid.

628
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,633
I'd do the same.

629
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,396
I'm sure.

630
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,767
I don't believe this!

631
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:24,209
And whom were you crying for?
Your friend?

632
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,350
Not over her.

633
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,178
You see?

634
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:31,013
Aren't you the victim?

635
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,588
Yes. I've also been cheated on.

636
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,088
By a terrorist?

637
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,958
You could say that.

638
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,426
But not a Shiite. He's from Madrid.

639
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,033
I don't give advice to the lovelorn.

640
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:47,193
You're certainly no lawyer,
you bitch!

641
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,804
Leave, or I'll call the police!

642
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,012
Was it helpful?

643
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,013
Yes. I feel much better.

644
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,583
Good.

645
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,814
What's this doing here?

646
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:12,257
A kid brought it
and said it's for Mr. Ivan.

647
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:16,832
If he wants it, let him come upstairs
and show his face!

648
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,662
Fine. Do you need some help?

649
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:22,304
No, I don't!

650
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,840
Pepa, I'm here in Madrid with you.
That's all I need.

651
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:33,142
I'm also with you, and I'm so happy
to see you write this card. Pepa.

652
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,983
He called?

653
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,693
Yeah. I answered.

654
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,194
Well? Give me that!

655
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:52,802
- I shouldn't read your postcards.
- Never mind. What did he say?

656
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,166
He's too embarrassed to see you,
because...

657
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,170
...you know who I am.

658
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,808
How sensitive of him!

659
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,807
I don't want to see him either...

660
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,470
...but if he wants
his damn suitcase...

661
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,844
...he'll have to come and get it!

662
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,816
- How are the girls?
- Fine.

663
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,318
Where's Candela?

664
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,150
In your room.

665
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,655
Did anything happen?

666
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:19,158
No, no. Did you see the lawyer?

667
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:22,389
Yes. I'll tell you about it later.

668
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,997
You mind my wearing your dress?

669
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,167
Keep it. It looks nicer on you.

670
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:38,678
Don't lose it again.
My shoes don't fit you.

671
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,510
- You saw the lawyer?
- Yes.

672
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,520
We're taking a trip.

673
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:49,216
Running from the law
like two fugitives?

674
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:53,556
It's best if we take a vacation
away from Madrid.

675
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,561
I sure need one.

676
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,132
I knew they'd lock me up...

677
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,132
...and get you for hiding me.

678
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:02,134
Nothing will happen.

679
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:04,296
We'll come back in a week.

680
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,466
You'll go to court
and tell everything...

681
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,135
...except for the fucking,
and that'll be that.

682
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:14,306
Really? Don't lie to me.
You know I'm naive.

683
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,975
The lawyer said not to worry...

684
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,816
...just to stay in touch with her.

685
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,822
I'm causing so much trouble...

686
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,985
...as if you don't have
enough of your own.

687
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,653
Let's water the plants now.

688
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,891
Then we'll pack our bags.

689
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,769
"Dr. J. Pardo.

690
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,501
Test results
on patient Pepa Marcos."

691
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,269
Christ!

692
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:50,347
- What about the animals?
- I don't know.

693
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,286
Your stepson was
snooping around all day, spying.

694
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:57,290
It's quite natural,
but he won't find much.

695
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,451
Relax. Let me do that.

696
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,789
Why?

697
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,296
- You feel okay?
- Sure.

698
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,266
You two clean the cage
while I water.

699
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,476
Poor things.
You're going to miss me.

700
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,475
You're depressed.

701
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,308
Just like me.

702
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,973
But you'll come along when I move.

703
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,983
I won't leave you alone.

704
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,612
I'd be a fine one to abandon you.

705
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,289
She's out cold. Let's see.

706
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,793
Anyway, who cares?
Too bad for her.

707
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,827
Poor bunnies!

708
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,666
Look. Totally dry.

709
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,001
Pepa just has
too much on her mind.

710
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,009
Did you ever have rabbits?

711
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,114
Back home I had many.

712
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,182
I know lots about them.

713
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:59,119
Look how they love turnips.

714
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:03,623
Carlos, I'm sorry I teased you
about your stuttering.

715
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,455
- Sometimes I'm so dumb.
- Forget it.

716
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,620
But you went a little too far.

717
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,289
You didn't behave properly.

718
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:14,801
Men keep taking advantage of me.

719
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:18,304
I always realize it when it's too late.

720
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:23,640
Look how the Arab world treated me.

721
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,304
I sure didn't deserve that.

722
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:37,355
This is Lucia.
I need to see you.

723
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:40,018
I can't. I'm leaving town.

724
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,754
We have to talk.

725
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,661
About something
that concerns us both.

726
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:48,065
If you mean Ivan,
I'm not interested.

727
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,638
Then why are you
going away with him?

728
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,399
Lady, you're nuts!

729
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,976
Between Ivan and me,
there's nothing but pain.

730
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,513
I'm coming anyway.
I know where you live.

731
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:03,140
For two days everyone
has been saying "no" to me.

732
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,583
Now it's my turn to say "no."

733
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:10,192
I must see Ivan
before he leaves.

734
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,591
Look somewhere else
and leave me alone!

735
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,991
- That was Mom?
- Yes.

736
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,826
Don't be too hard on her.

737
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,797
The way she talks...

738
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,266
She's mentally ill.

739
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,531
She threatened to come here.

740
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,174
- She shouldn't see you.
- And me?

741
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:30,108
Fix Marisa some coffee.
We need to talk.

742
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,272
The lawyer didn't work out.
We got into a fight.

743
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,008
She won't defend her?

744
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,983
She'd rather prosecute her.
How'd you meet her?

745
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,416
She was Mom's lawyer.

746
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:42,285
I'm not surprised
your mother is sick.

747
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,523
They split up before I was born.

748
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,561
After my birth, she went crazy...

749
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,562
...and was placed
in a mental institution.

750
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,394
My grandparents raised me.

751
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:56,201
They wouldn't let Ivan see me.

752
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,340
You can look now.

753
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,042
Mom was released a year ago.

754
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:08,344
When she got out,
she wanted to go back to Ivan...

755
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,782
...but he was with you.

756
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,945
Can you zip me up?

757
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:16,990
So she sued him for millions...

758
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,527
...for all the time
she'd been locked up.

759
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,289
Paulina was her lawyer.

760
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,296
Your mother doesn't mess around.

761
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:28,198
Paulina tried to sue Ivan,
but it didn't work.

762
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,339
What an insane story.

763
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,065
Mom hates me.

764
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:35,803
I represent all her years
without Ivan.

765
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,776
Well, I love you.

766
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,711
You're the only good thing
Ivan ever did.

767
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:47,884
- Oh, it's you.
- I didn't want to interrupt.

768
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:51,220
- Why so dressed up?
- I'm going out.

769
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,123
Don't mention the lawyer.

770
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:56,163
- What?
- See if you can wake up Marisa.

771
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,960
- And if not?
- It's up to you.

772
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,899
- Anyway, we're leaving.
- What?

773
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:03,299
- On a trip.
- Where?

774
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,304
- It's a secret.
- We're fugitives.

775
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,035
It's better if you don't know.

776
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,975
- But he knows everything.
- Come on.

777
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,483
What if Ivan calls?

778
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:23,822
Tell him I expect nothing
from him.

779
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:26,689
All I have left from him
is the suitcase...

780
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,558
...and I'm getting rid of it now.

781
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,495
No. Don't say anything.

782
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,160
Don't get the phone...

783
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:36,464
...or the door.

784
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:37,833
Fine.

785
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:40,538
I'll be right back.

786
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:51,316
I overheard about your mom,
and I'm really sorry.

787
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,220
You're a kissing fanatic!

788
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,985
Let's give her some coffee.

789
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:12,033
What's wrong?

790
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,540
Nothing. She's having fun.

791
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,537
I've never seen her like this.

792
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,616
Don't wake her.
She's having a great time.

793
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,479
See her face?

794
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,712
She's having a ball.

795
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,318
Her face!

796
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,152
Look at her lip!

797
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,673
Hi. I've come for my bag.
Pepa said it was here.

798
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:50,438
That's strange.
A kid brought it down earlier...

799
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,343
...but when Pepa saw it,
she threw a fit.

800
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:57,542
- So where's the bag?
- She took it and she said:

801
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,245
"If he wants it,
let him come and get it...

802
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,913
...and show his face!"

803
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,082
That's what she said.

804
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,659
She's upstairs now.

805
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,023
I'm in a hurry.

806
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,829
She's probably calmed down...

807
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,730
...but you never know.

808
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:17,066
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't tell her I was here.

809
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:21,801
Sir, I'm a Jehovah's Witness
and cannot tell lies.

810
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,912
Only the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

811
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,343
But if she doesn't ask...

812
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,314
If she asks,
I have to tell the gospel truth.

813
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,009
Goodbye.

814
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,484
I'd like to lie!

815
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:35,749
The bad thing
about my religion is...

816
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:37,984
...that we can't.

817
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:49,862
I love the sound of the trumpets
on Judgment Day

818
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:56,100
Ivan, I have to speak
to you immediately.

819
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,737
Leave a message
and tell me when and where.

820
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,481
I can't pick up my bag.

821
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,814
I wanted to talk to you...

822
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:09,253
...but I see you're avoiding me.

823
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:12,519
I'll try again in a few days...

824
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,788
...when you're a bit calmer.

825
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:18,433
I want you to know
that our years together...

826
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:22,002
...were the best of my life.

827
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,772
I'm not going away
with any woman.

828
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,475
Goodbye, sweetheart.

829
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,581
I wish you the best
with all my heart.

830
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:38,944
I'm so unhappy

831
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:42,421
Because you no longer love me

832
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,392
Why should I try
to change your mind

833
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:53,130
Be happy, my love

834
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:59,798
For I'll never forget
the love you gave me

835
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,778
I'm so unhappy

836
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:11,481
Look at him!

837
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,346
He's nuts!

838
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,329
I'll show her, all right!

839
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,962
Pepa, you'll pay dearly
for those three Shiites!

840
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,168
I'm not going away
with any women.

841
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,643
Goodbye, sweetheart.
I wish you the best...

842
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,373
Liar!

843
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:42,149
Maybe it's true.

844
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,616
He can fool me with everything
but his voice.

845
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:49,281
I know all his intonations.
I worked long enough with him.

846
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,085
Goddamn phone!

847
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:54,026
What were you doing?

848
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:58,193
That damn fucking bitch!

849
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,591
What did you see in her?

850
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,203
Let's get your luggage.

851
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:04,096
- You did it again.
- Forget it.

852
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:07,868
Calm down!
Just look at this place.

853
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:13,345
- The cops!
- Take it easy. Come on.

854
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,108
It's Ivan.
I knew he's no coward.

855
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:17,275
It's your mother.

856
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,715
- Let's play.
- I can't!

857
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,788
- Should I let her in?
- Yes.

858
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,824
- Read the instructions!
- "Strategy is..."

859
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,585
Not out loud!

860
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:31,664
What are you doing here,
traitor?

861
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,632
- Well...
- Carlos, who is it?

862
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,203
I don't know.

863
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,600
It's the police.

864
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:40,975
What do they want?

865
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:45,906
We understood.

866
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,175
- Come on.
- Right.

867
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,810
Shut up or I'll smack you.

868
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,359
Good evening.

869
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,928
Is she with you?

870
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,031
We met in the elevator.

871
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:13,874
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

872
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:17,672
- Just discussing the lady's dress.
- It's awful.

873
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,372
- It's just a dress.
- But it's awful.

874
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,914
Maybe she likes it.

875
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:26,453
Stop acting like a kid
in front of the policemen!

876
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:32,861
"I love you, need you, want you."

877
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,054
"Your Ivan."

878
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,530
May I ask why you're here?

879
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,135
A call was made
from your telephone...

880
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,794
...about some terrorists.

881
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,803
Pardon?

882
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:49,468
Someone called from here
about the Shiite terrorists.

883
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,613
See! I told you!

884
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,806
Those kids!

885
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:58,852
There's been some mistake.
My phone's been out of order all day.

886
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,046
She just now pulled it out.

887
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,521
I called her 20 minutes ago.

888
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,661
Ignore her. She's a bit crazy.

889
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,820
- What am I charged with?
- Nothing.

890
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:12,456
We just wanted information
about who called.

891
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,897
Who ripped out the phone?

892
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,197
I did. This morning.

893
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,397
So nobody's called
from here today.

894
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,474
Pepa's some talker!

895
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,837
Why?

896
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:25,640
I was expecting a call.
They didn't call, and I got upset.

897
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,283
Who? Ivan? Where is he?

898
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,648
Shut up. I'll ask the questions.
Well, we will.

899
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,551
Go ahead. Ask her who Ivan is.

900
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,522
- Who's Ivan?
- The cause of this mess...

901
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:40,059
...and of the mess
your partner's about to see.

902
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,694
He's going to find Marisa.

903
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:44,958
All right. Explain.

904
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,193
May I sit down?

905
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:52,105
If I'm to bare my soul,
I'd rather be comfortable.

906
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,037
I've had a hard day.

907
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:55,574
Are you comfortable?

908
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,379
I'd be more comfortable
alone with my friends...

909
01:06:58,547 --> 01:06:59,912
...playing Strategy.

910
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,607
You can't always
have everything.

911
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,480
We agree on that.

912
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,178
Who is this Ivan?

913
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:11,452
He was my lover.
Before that he was with her.

914
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,027
He's my son's father.

915
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,494
Him?
What's he doing here?

916
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,724
He came to rent my apartment.

917
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:19,925
I didn't know.

918
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:23,265
I get the feeling
you're pulling my leg.

919
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:26,772
You think I like
baring my soul to strangers?

920
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:29,968
Well, you're wrong.
It's humiliating.

921
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,773
Damn it, Mom!

922
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,381
- Candela, get me a drink.
- What kind?

923
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,110
- There's gazpacho.
- Right! Gazpacho!

924
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,753
Let's go.

925
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:43,287
- Where are you going?
- For gazpacho. Want some?

926
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,257
We're on duty,
but we don't want to be rude...

927
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,659
Gazpacho for everyone.

928
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,924
Is she sleeping?

929
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,796
Like a log.
She's Carlos' fiancée.

930
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:57,200
She was tired.
You want me to wake her up?

931
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,000
Not yet.

932
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:03,043
Why don't you sit down?
I'm getting a stiff neck.

933
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,615
We have nothing against you...

934
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:15,188
Thanks a lot.

935
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:18,155
Without being inquisitive...

936
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,795
...you must admit
this is a little weird.

937
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,897
A charred bedroom...

938
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,657
...a broken phone,
a smashed window...

939
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,302
It's been weird, all right.

940
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,836
Okay. Start at the beginning.

941
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,235
And make it clear,
concise, and fair.

942
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,602
I don't know if I can.

943
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,506
I'm too hurt to be clear,
concise, and fair.

944
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,668
Words!

945
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,941
- Just the facts.
- Okay.

946
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,483
I lived here with Ivan.

947
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:47,179
We loved each other.
At least, I loved him.

948
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:51,224
After months of trying
to keep our love together...

949
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,353
...we split up a week ago.

950
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,990
He told me to pack his bags.
He'd be taking a trip...

951
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,760
...with another woman.

952
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:03,666
- He said that?
- He never travels alone.

953
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,570
Remember, these two
for the cops. An extra dose.

954
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,472
Careful.

955
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,545
This is too warm.

956
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,217
Carlos, my God!

957
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:20,151
In front of your mother,
the cops, your fiancée!

958
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,550
Aren't you afraid?

959
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,783
Go on, please.

960
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,689
So I packed up his stuff
and went to work.

961
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:29,626
When I came back,
the house was like this.

962
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:32,426
Except for the phone,
which I did.

963
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,126
The suitcase was gone...

964
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,966
...and the bed was all burned.

965
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:42,804
They're taking very long.
Go. Check.

966
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,577
They're probably kissing.

967
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,648
- What about Marisa?
- She'd better wake up.

968
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,184
Takes after his father.

969
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:55,622
- Now, who's that?
- Yeah?

970
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,782
- Telephone repair. And you?
- Police.

971
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,656
- Your I.D.?
- And yours?

972
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,901
Are you the lady
who called this morning?

973
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:14,941
Yes. Here's the phone,
and here's the plug.

974
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,079
I reached her here by phone
20 minutes ago.

975
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,839
There she goes again!

976
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:21,880
Not on this phone.

977
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,746
Let's get to the point.

978
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:28,049
Do you know
any Shiite terrorists?

979
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,384
Shut up! He's asking her!

980
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,959
I didn't know Madrid had any.

981
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,857
Do you know them?

982
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,228
Not me. I'm not into politics.

983
01:10:39,401 --> 01:10:41,392
Sure, man.
They were on TV today!

984
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,437
- Shut up!
- You want the TV on?

985
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:47,405
I'm not interested in Shiites.

986
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,134
Ma'am, what about you?

987
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:52,712
Pepa and I have
important things to discuss.

988
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,041
Men, right?

989
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:55,410
What's more important?

990
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,848
Fine. We'll talk about men.

991
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,715
Is Ivan involved
with these terrorists?

992
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,960
- Relax.
- Ivan?

993
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,429
I don't know.
He's hidden so many things from me.

994
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,568
Can you give me his address...

995
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,064
...or phone number?

996
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:20,231
He has no phone.
And he's not home.

997
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,502
I told you he's leaving town.

998
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,009
Try the airport.

999
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:28,139
The airport? Where's he going?

1000
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,998
Where is he going?

1001
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,007
To Stockholm. Tonight.
With Paulina Morales.

1002
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,282
Stockholm!

1003
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,610
Why didn't you say so before?

1004
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,351
Because I just figured it out.

1005
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:09,582
Now I understand it all.

1006
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,282
The phone call.

1007
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,226
What an idiot I am!
Why didn't I see it before?

1008
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,830
Your lawyer
played it beautifully.

1009
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,664
You didn't know
they'd be hijacking that flight?

1010
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,565
The Shiites?

1011
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:33,913
The whole country knows.
It was on TV.

1012
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,517
But the tip
came from this phone.

1013
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,415
I want to know
who the hell called...

1014
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,988
...or I'll haul you all in!

1015
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,988
Why aren't you at the airport?

1016
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:49,597
There are more cops there
than passengers.

1017
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,191
I don't know what's going on...

1018
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,394
...but if you don't start talking...

1019
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,335
Chief, this stuff has been spiked.

1020
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,911
What's in the gazpacho?

1021
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,842
Tomatoes, cucumbers...

1022
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,847
...bell pepper, onion...

1023
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:10,416
...one garlic clove...

1024
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:15,819
...oil, salt, vinegar...

1025
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:18,357
...some day-old bread, and water.

1026
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,052
The secret's in mixing it right.

1027
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,892
Ivan loves the way I mix it.

1028
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,260
I made it for him.

1029
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,794
You collect weapons?

1030
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,131
Get back!

1031
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:34,437
Move back. I don't want
to hurt the kids.

1032
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,238
Is Ivan really going
to Stockholm?

1033
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,143
It's just a hunch,
but I'm pretty sure.

1034
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:42,476
What did you have to tell him?

1035
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,710
Nothing, now.

1036
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:47,754
I just want to forget him.

1037
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,653
And you should do the same.

1038
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,522
In the hospital,
I had forgotten him.

1039
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,220
I didn't remember anything.

1040
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,922
Until suddenly...

1041
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:02,230
...one night,
I heard his voice on TV.

1042
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,269
I didn't recognize his face...

1043
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,465
...just his voice.

1044
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,769
He was telling a woman
he loved her.

1045
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:12,778
I felt a spasm inside me.

1046
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:16,475
I remembered all the times
he's said that to me.

1047
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,820
I regained my sanity
and my memory.

1048
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,388
From that moment on...

1049
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:25,789
...I acted as if I had been cured...

1050
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,986
...and they released me.

1051
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,859
If you're cured,
stop aiming at me.

1052
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:34,992
But I'm not cured.

1053
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:38,298
I faked it, and I fooled them.

1054
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:42,035
I can only forget him
by killing him.

1055
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:45,180
How will you do that?

1056
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:46,814
At the airport.

1057
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:50,975
The airport is full of cops.
You heard him.

1058
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,620
I'll manage.

1059
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,150
Now that you know...

1060
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,259
Let's drink a toast.

1061
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:11,667
Drink!

1062
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:13,601
You too.

1063
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,379
Oh, my eyes!

1064
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:37,559
My eyes!

1065
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,697
She left the door open!

1066
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,863
The door!

1067
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,520
Take me to the airport,
please.

1068
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,156
Sorry. I have a date.

1069
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,848
Take me!

1070
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:06,688
- What the hell is that?
- A gun. Let's go.

1071
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:08,489
My girlfriend will be mad.

1072
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:13,067
Not as mad as I'll be.
Quick, to Stockholm!

1073
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,012
Right under my nose!

1074
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,442
Did you see that?

1075
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,412
Come on. After them!

1076
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,713
You again! Great!

1077
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:34,355
We're meant for each other!

1078
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:36,252
Whom do we follow today?

1079
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,723
- That motorcycle!
- That Harley!

1080
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,093
I'll do my best.

1081
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,698
To the airport!

1082
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,925
Blow on my eyes.

1083
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:50,663
That lady is crazy,
and she carries two guns.

1084
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:54,240
- Why did she take Ambite?
- Because she's in a hurry.

1085
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,310
Ah! Eyedrops!

1086
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:59,344
Anything else, ladies?

1087
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:03,507
No. Just step on it.
That lady is dangerous.

1088
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:06,620
No lady's dangerous
if you know how to handle her.

1089
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,120
- There they are.
- I've got them.

1090
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,280
I can't see.

1091
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,485
He can never say "no."

1092
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:16,529
Ana, that lady has two guns,
and she's a nut.

1093
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:19,098
Look what she did to me!

1094
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:22,327
You think I go around
like this for fun?

1095
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:25,098
She's capable of anything!

1096
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,205
My ass is the only one
allowed on that bike.

1097
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,573
I'm fed up.

1098
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,147
I'm gonna get myself
some quick cash...

1099
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,783
...buy myself his bike and split.

1100
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:37,179
With a bike...

1101
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,252
...who needs a man?

1102
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:42,322
Learning mechanics is easier
than learning male psychology.

1103
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,860
You can figure out a bike...

1104
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:48,963
...but you can never
figure out a man.

1105
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:52,192
She's going for his balls!

1106
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:54,927
I think she's just
trying to hang on.

1107
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,333
Fresh out of the mental ward...

1108
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,371
...and she looks
like a professional biker.

1109
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:16,455
Be careful! She's crazy!

1110
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:17,922
And she has a gun!

1111
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,628
Bitch!

1112
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:22,354
Get down!

1113
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:33,464
Shut up, idiot women!

1114
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,750
Leave my man alone!

1115
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,338
Can't you go any faster?

1116
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:08,032
Lady, this thing is a relic.

1117
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:11,111
A relic?
Just remember this gun!

1118
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,769
Okay! Don't shoot!

1119
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,622
Don't you sell guns?

1120
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,316
I don't need them.

1121
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,189
What if you're held up?

1122
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,262
I avoid danger, just like now.

1123
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:33,094
Sorry, ladies.
The chase is over.

1124
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:37,295
Please, just take us
to the airport somehow.

1125
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:40,373
I'm a taxi driver,
not a bounty hunter.

1126
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:42,942
I warned you
she was a dangerous woman.

1127
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,840
He said he could deal.

1128
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,999
Right here.

1129
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:11,936
Thanks.

1130
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,847
Stockholm, please?

1131
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:22,449
International flights
are over there.

1132
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,998
- You're weak, Ivan.
- Yes, sweetheart.

1133
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:15,694
- Don't agree with me!
- But you're right.

1134
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,999
Sometimes I like to be wrong.

1135
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:18,657
Take me back to the hospital.
That's my home.

1136
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:43,288
Are you all right?

1137
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,255
Let go.

1138
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:47,827
You saved my life, darling.

1139
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:51,830
Don't worry.
I don't want anything in return.

1140
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,491
Just one thing.
Tell her to go away!

1141
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,194
Go away!

1142
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,200
Pepa, I'm ashamed.

1143
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:06,541
I've treated you so badly.

1144
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,774
All I wanted was to talk to you.

1145
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,248
I've spent two days waiting...

1146
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:13,979
...looking for you,
leaving messages.

1147
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:16,180
We can talk tonight.

1148
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:18,155
The trip to Stockholm can wait.

1149
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,692
No. It's too late now.

1150
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:22,227
Don't hold a grudge.

1151
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:26,026
Let's have a drink,
now, in the cafeteria.

1152
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,196
Yesterday, this morning,
or even at noon today...

1153
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:32,101
...we could have.

1154
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:33,934
But now it's too late.

1155
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,373
It's been too late
for the past two hours.

1156
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:40,571
Then why did you come out here?

1157
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,877
Lucia wanted to kill you...

1158
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:48,079
...and I came to stop her.

1159
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:51,419
Since you're out of danger,
I'm leaving.

1160
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:54,823
Goodbye.

1161
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,751
Home at last!

1162
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:24,891
The visitors...

1163
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:27,221
...are comfortable.

1164
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,693
And the kids?

1165
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:33,231
Candela really manages
to recover quickly.

1166
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:36,097
Hope he's luckier for her
than the Shiites were.

1167
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:38,934
God, what a mess!

1168
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:41,234
The maid comes tomorrow.

1169
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:44,207
Better wear shoes
with this mess.

1170
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:46,677
I wonder which is better...

1171
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:50,545
...slipping on gazpacho,
or cutting myself on the glass.

1172
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:54,484
The repairman is a doll, but
I'd better save him for Marisa.

1173
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:06,499
I fell asleep.

1174
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:07,930
How do you feel?

1175
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:11,163
Like new. But you don't look so hot.

1176
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:14,536
Well, I'm going to have a baby.

1177
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:16,233
I didn't know.

1178
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,470
You're the first person
I've told.

1179
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,615
Congratulations!
You should sit here.

1180
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:28,549
I'll explain tomorrow.

1181
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:30,623
- But...
- Sit down.

1182
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:34,728
You just woke up,
but I haven't slept in two days.

1183
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:38,761
I won't sublet it.

1184
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:40,662
I love the view.

1185
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:45,138
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

1186
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,033
How long was I asleep?

1187
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:50,905
Hours!

1188
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,240
You have beautiful skin.

1189
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:57,382
I had a dream.

1190
01:25:57,552 --> 01:26:00,180
- A good one?
- I think so.

1191
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,390
I was a virgin this morning...

1192
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:06,151
...but I don't think I am now.

1193
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:10,195
- Don't tell me one of these jerks...
- No. It was in my dream!

1194
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,265
Great!

1195
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:14,424
Actually, you've lost...

1196
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,536
...that hard look
that virgins have.

1197
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:17,762
Virgins are awful.
