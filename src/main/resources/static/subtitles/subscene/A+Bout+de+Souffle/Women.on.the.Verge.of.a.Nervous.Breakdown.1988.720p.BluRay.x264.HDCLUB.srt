1
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:31,675
Ivan and I moved here
a few months ago.

2
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,007
The world was falling apart...

3
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:37,883
and I wanted to save it
and save myself.

4
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:40,049
I felt like Noah.

5
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,007
In the coop on my terrace...

6
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:45,384
I wanted to save
a couple of each species.

7
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:48,299
Anyway...

8
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:51,592
I couldn't save
the couple I cared about most--

9
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,174
Ivan and me.

10
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,299
Pepa, darling...

11
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:58,801
I never want to hear you say,
"I'm unhappy. "

12
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:00,091
Yours, Ivan.

13
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,677
Life means nothing without you.

14
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,051
Will you marry me?

15
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:43,553
1 ,001 nights
wouldn't be enough.

16
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,677
I can't live without you.

17
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:50,719
I love you,
desire you, need you.

18
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,262
That night in the jungle
was heaven.

19
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,303
Let's get married again.

20
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:00,470
You're the geisha of my life.
Sayonara.

21
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:05,053
With you by my side,
I don't need success.

22
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:07,886
I'm willing
to accept you as you are.

23
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,637
Baby, some things
are unmistakably American.

24
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:17,886
I'm all yours.

25
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,637
- I accept you as you are.
- Great.

26
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:34,471
How many men
have you had to forget?

27
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,886
Say something nice.

28
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:42,845
Lie.

29
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:45,638
Tell me you've been
waiting for me...

30
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:50,721
and you'd die
if I didn't return.

31
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,680
Say you still love me
as I love you.

32
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,221
Thanks.

33
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:08,055
Thanks a lot.

34
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:33,223
Call these two numbers.

35
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:36,222
First, I'll call one...

36
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:38,348
then the other.

37
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,056
Pepa.

38
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,599
Pepa, sweetheart,
did you oversleep?

39
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,849
We started without you.

40
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:56,725
Listen. Pack all my stuff
in a suitcase.

41
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:59,057
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

42
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,599
I'll come and pick it up
and say good-bye...

43
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:03,598
but I'll call you before.

44
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,851
If you don't want to see me,
just leave it downstairs.

45
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,599
Thanks for being so understanding.

46
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,349
I don't deserve it.

47
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,266
I'll call later, darling.

48
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:20,683
Ivan?

49
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,474
"EXA." Hello.

50
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:35,934
Is Ivan there?

51
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:37,474
He just called me.

52
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:39,767
Sorry. He just left.

53
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:44,395
But your director is here
having a fit 'cause you're not here.

54
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:46,475
Yes. Here he is.

55
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:52,392
I'm sorry, German.

56
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:56,228
I couldn't sleep,
so I took a pill.

57
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:59,936
Don't worry. Just come now.

58
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,517
I'll be right there.

59
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,770
I have to stop by
for some test results on my way.

60
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,185
Okay, but make it quick.

61
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,853
Some people are lucky.
I'll call your cab now.

62
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,352
Who wanted a taxi?

63
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:22,812
Whoever asked for a taxi,
come to the front desk.

64
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:24,811
Don't smoke...

65
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:27,603
eat properly,
and you'll be fine.

66
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,480
Mr. Salcedo,
please pick up the telephone.

67
00:07:45,393 --> 00:07:47,312
It's about time. Studio seven.

68
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:48,811
Did Ivan call again?

69
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,271
No. Forget him, honey.

70
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:53,478
I'm working on it.

71
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,020
Just give me time.

72
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:56,854
And cut the microphone.

73
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:00,480
Give me that paper!
Give me that!

74
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:19,856
- I'm really sorry, guys.
- Okay, let's go.

75
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:25,814
Arturo, do you take...

76
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,479
Eugenia as your wife...

77
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:30,480
and promise to be faithful,
for richer or for poorer...

78
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:32,981
in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?

79
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:35,314
Yeah, I think so.

80
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:40,772
And you, Eugenia. Eugenia?

81
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,606
Yes, Father?

82
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:44,522
Do you take Arturo
as your husband?

83
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:46,814
Sure. Of course I do.

84
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,773
What God has united,
let no man tear asunder.

85
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:54,231
Can we kiss now, Father?

86
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:57,399
My child, you mustn't trust any man.

87
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,106
Not even my husband?

88
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,940
You can't be too careful.

89
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,191
Fine. We'll check it later.

90
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,023
Roll it.

91
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,733
- You start rehearsing.
- Thank you.

92
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,733
Here. Drink.

93
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:39,357
I'm not thirsty.

94
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,233
It'll help you to sleep.

95
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:45,277
I already tried it,
and it didn't help.

96
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:47,734
How many men
have you had to forget?

97
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:50,902
As many as the women
you remember.

98
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,441
Don't go.

99
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:53,900
I haven't moved.

100
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:55,942
Say something nice.

101
00:09:57,482 --> 00:10:00,109
What shall I say?

102
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:03,819
Lie. Tell me you've
waited for me forever.

103
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:07,234
I've waited for you
all these years.

104
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,735
Say you'd die
if I didn't return.

105
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:13,194
I'd have died
if you hadn't returned.

106
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:16,861
Say you still love me
as I love you.

107
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:19,861
I still love you as you love me.

108
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:22,319
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

109
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,651
Pepa, are you okay?

110
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,820
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

111
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,736
You've got some nerve.

112
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:58,028
Call this number, please.

113
00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:00,361
You have no right, Pepa.

114
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:01,861
Just dial the number.

115
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:03,360
You're making a fool of yourself.

116
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:06,071
Well, a little more won't hurt.

117
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:08,028
- Were you crying?
- Yes.

118
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,572
There! You see? I knew it, Pepa.

119
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:15,363
Dial! They won't like
you holding up our work.

120
00:11:15,443 --> 00:11:20,031
Yes, right away.
Excuse me! At your service!

121
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,528
My coffee can wait.

122
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:24,405
I've had enough breakfasts
in my time.

123
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:26,446
The other woman's number.

124
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,739
She'll never learn. Not her.

125
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:33,698
She should have by now.
Not her.

126
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,695
No way.

127
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:42,531
- Who's this?
- Pepa Marcos. Is Ivan there?

128
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,907
- Forgive my bothering you.
- I won't forgive you.

129
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:49,780
I must speak to him. It's urgent.

130
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:51,279
How dare you call here?

131
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:54,656
Don't yell at me.
I just had a fainting spell.

132
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,822
I don't care if you drop dead!

133
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:59,531
Look, Ivan and I are finished.

134
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:01,947
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off yourself!

135
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:05,405
Just tell him to call me.

136
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:10,490
Pepa, I didn't know
you had fainted.

137
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:11,989
Poor thing.

138
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:13,822
This is too much!

139
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:15,614
Don't you dare defend her!

140
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,281
- Mom.
- Yes?

141
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,781
We should talk.

142
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,950
Not now. I'm doing my eye lines,
and you make me nervous.

143
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,990
Okay. Then later?

144
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:27,616
Later. Later.

145
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:32,073
What's wrong?

146
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:36,368
That bitch Ivan sleeps with
had the nerve to call me.

147
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:39,617
He should be more discreet.

148
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:42,200
Why haven't I thrown those out?

149
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,157
Dad wouldn't let you.

150
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:46,949
I could sell them at the store,
you know?

151
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:48,949
I like wearing them.

152
00:12:49,031 --> 00:12:50,949
It's as if time stood still.

153
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:54,242
Well, it hasn't stood still.

154
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:58,910
Don't be rude.
Let her wear what she wants.

155
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:01,909
Go on. Humor her.
She'll never get well.

156
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,908
Let me help you.

157
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:06,784
- Hold that.
- Let's see. There.

158
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,951
Like it?

159
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:15,951
You look terrific.

160
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:19,619
You're a great liar, Dad.
That's why I love you.

161
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:23,575
You think it's too dark?

162
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,786
- No.
- Neither do l.

163
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:36,827
- Am I interrupting something?
- No. How are you?

164
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:39,243
- Fine.
- How's the penthouse?

165
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:42,870
- Are you enjoying it?
- It's great, but I'm here to sublet it.

166
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,077
We'll get a good price for it.

167
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,495
Good. I'll want to rent an apartment.

168
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:51,495
Can I make a call?
I've been out all day.

169
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:53,494
What type of apartment?

170
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,703
With a terrace, but not so big.

171
00:13:58,283 --> 00:14:01,328
- Yours is number seven Montalban?
- Yes, seventh floor.

172
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:05,162
220 square yards
including the terrace.

173
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:12,829
Everybody just loved your scale model.

174
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:14,327
It turned out well.

175
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:16,119
The jerk hasn't called.

176
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:19,204
- How much is that?
- 200 pesetas.

177
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:26,746
- Is Isabel here?
- She's busy. Can I help you?

178
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:29,412
- I have to see her.
- One moment.

179
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:34,495
Hi.

180
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,829
You want to try a facial?

181
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,621
- I can't now.
- It's free.

182
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:42,996
They're giving a demonstration.

183
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:45,913
I need sleeping pills.

184
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:47,663
I've run out.

185
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:51,915
- You have the prescription?
- No. I'll bring it later or tomorrow.

186
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:54,288
I can't sleep without them.

187
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,081
- Okay.
- Thanks.

188
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,040
- She's not much in person.
- She's skinnier than on TV.

189
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:29,083
Pepa, honey, are you there?

190
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,040
If I can't reach you,
I'm going to get worried.

191
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,539
So am l.

192
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:37,583
I've had no luck
reaching you today, so--

193
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:39,414
Well?

194
00:15:39,496 --> 00:15:42,040
I feel you're avoiding me.

195
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:44,540
Such bullshit.

196
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:47,374
I'll keep trying until I get you.

197
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,791
- I may get lucky.
- Sure.

198
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:52,541
I really want to talk to you.

199
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:55,542
- I miss you.
- I noticed.

200
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,874
Well, take care.

201
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,874
See you later.

202
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:01,916
Asshole.

203
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:36,376
This is Juan
at the real estate agency.

204
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:39,752
Tomorrow I'm sending a couple
to see your apartment.

205
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,376
Try to be there in the morning.
Thank you.

206
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,793
I'm sick of being good.

207
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,795
I shouldn't smoke.

208
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:58,841
I'm finally getting rid of this shit!

209
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:02,882
And this dumb flower!

210
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:07,675
Who'd think of giving a duck
as a present?

211
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:09,172
Only you.

212
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:13,426
But now I'll get rid of it all.
And of you!

213
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:39,179
"Something's come up
that concerns both of us.

214
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,722
I must talk to you before you leave."

215
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:18,096
Follow that cab!

216
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:22,097
I thought this only happened
in the movies.

217
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:26,971
WELCOME TO MAMBO TAXI

218
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:30,013
MAGAZINES FOR RENT

219
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:33,472
Help yourself.
It's on the house.

220
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:36,264
Thanks. Just follow that cab.

221
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:39,181
Don't worry. It's under control.

222
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:42,054
Do you mind the Mambo?

223
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:45,347
I've got everything.
Heavy metal, rock, soul...

224
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:48,473
cumbias, even sevillanas.

225
00:21:48,553 --> 00:21:51,014
Salsa, techno-pop...

226
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:52,638
whatever you like.

227
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,222
- You really like Mambo?
- I love Mambo.

228
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,556
Yes, the Mambo...

229
00:21:57,637 --> 00:22:00,307
goes best with this decor.

230
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:04,972
You're that TV actress.

231
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:09,600
You play the killer's mother.

232
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,348
How about an autograph?

233
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:16,515
It's for my girlfriend.
Could you make it personal?

234
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:19,348
- What's her name?
- Azucena.

235
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:24,099
THANK YOU FOR SMOKING

236
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:34,892
- It stopped.
- What's the address?

237
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:38,601
Thirty-eight Almagro,
but I don't know what floor.

238
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,098
She waved.

239
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:43,974
She knows we're here.

240
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,974
I don't care.

241
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:48,141
Where to now?

242
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:50,433
Montalban, and thank you.

243
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:37,311
Ladies, there's something
for you to lean on.

244
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:42,021
Hope it does you more good
than it did me.

245
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:45,269
Here's your food,
and that's to sleep on.

246
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:48,019
You can shit on it all you like.

247
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,770
Hey. Jump here. Jump!

248
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:53,603
She won't jump. She hates it.

249
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,478
Well, back to my waiting.

250
00:24:16,976 --> 00:24:19,145
Number 38 Almagro.

251
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,104
Number 38... Almagro.
Let's see.

252
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:33,229
Almagro... Almagro...
Almagro.

253
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,813
31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 38.

254
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,896
410-0430.

255
00:24:40,935 --> 00:24:43,396
Of course!

256
00:24:44,602 --> 00:24:48,648
Of course. It's the same one
who insulted me this morning.

257
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:54,355
Hello.

258
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:58,690
I'm the mother
of the notorious "Crossroads Killer."

259
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,690
When my son comes home
after one of his famous crimes...

260
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,147
his clothes are just filthy.

261
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,356
Where are the clothes
your son wore...

262
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:11,606
at the time of the murder?

263
00:25:12,937 --> 00:25:16,607
Right here. Sparkling clean.

264
00:25:18,938 --> 00:25:21,357
- No trace of blood.
- Or guts.

265
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,856
Unbelievable.

266
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:26,523
Ecce Homo. It's unbelievable.

267
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,525
A group of armed Shiites
was captured here in Madrid today....

268
00:25:57,605 --> 00:26:00,900
according to police sources.

269
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,943
A local Shiite spokesman
living in Madrid...

270
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:10,777
stated that the commando group
was acting on its own...

271
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:15,194
without any connection
to the Shiite community.

272
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:19,275
The same police sources...

273
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:21,609
promise to release
additional information...

274
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:23,608
within a few hours...

275
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:26,859
after the interrogations
are completed.

276
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:31,359
Oh, my book!

277
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:02,738
Ivan, I have to speak to you.
It's urgent.

278
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:06,403
Leave a message
telling me where and when.

279
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:10,653
I'm going out to look for you now. Bye.

280
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,361
It's me-- Candela.
I've got to see you.

281
00:27:16,442 --> 00:27:19,278
I'm going out. Call me later.

282
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,279
- I'm in trouble.
- So am l. Good-bye.

283
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,320
Pepa! Damn it, I need you!

284
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:27,825
- Pepa, it's me.
- That woman!

285
00:29:27,906 --> 00:29:29,616
Pepa, answer.

286
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:33,866
I'm in big trouble.

287
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:40,952
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

288
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:46,617
- What are you doing?
- Making a phone call.

289
00:29:46,657 --> 00:29:48,659
Well, make it!

290
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:53,119
- Your mother's too much.
- I'm sorry, Marisa.

291
00:29:53,157 --> 00:29:56,244
- And that slut in the window!
- What slut? Where?

292
00:29:56,323 --> 00:29:59,618
Weren't you going to use the phone?
Why don't you use it?

293
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:01,200
Let's go.

294
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:03,994
Gather everything and let's go.

295
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:42,370
"Something's come up
that concerns us both.

296
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,413
I must talk to you
before you leave."

297
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:48,452
Throw that away!

298
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,954
God, I hope he called.

299
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:29,038
Pepa, it's 5.:00A.M.

300
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,788
I'm across from your place,
and you're still not home.

301
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:37,706
I don't know which end is up
anymore!

302
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:42,664
I can't explain over the phone.

303
00:31:42,744 --> 00:31:44,162
What a pest!

304
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:46,455
I'll tell you one thing--

305
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:51,749
I don't understand,
because if you had a problem--

306
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:54,748
You'll feel guilty about this!

307
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,456
- It's you.
- I called a million times.

308
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:10,456
You're a drag!

309
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:12,582
Don't say that, or I'll leave.

310
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:14,582
Come on in.

311
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:17,124
I've been out all night.

312
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:18,622
So have l.

313
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:20,123
Let's have some coffee.

314
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,624
- Going somewhere?
- No. Ivan's leaving me.

315
00:32:23,705 --> 00:32:26,624
- We're doing great.
- My life's a mess.

316
00:32:26,705 --> 00:32:28,123
Mine too.

317
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:31,584
- Problems at work?
- No. I couldn't tell you on the phone.

318
00:32:31,663 --> 00:32:34,583
The phone! I just ripped it out!

319
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:37,000
Damn! I'll have to call
the phone company.

320
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,749
Can I stay here?

321
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:41,749
I'm in big trouble, Pepa!

322
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:45,793
Fix the coffee, then we'll talk.
You're a pain today!

323
00:32:46,956 --> 00:32:48,624
What?

324
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:52,126
Don't call me a pain!
I'm feeling very vulnerable.

325
00:32:57,165 --> 00:32:58,624
My God.

326
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:04,877
Looks like the work of terrorists.

327
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:07,625
Oh, the phone--

328
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:12,084
This just isn't normal.

329
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:16,126
God, the cops. I'm dead.

330
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,293
Hello.

331
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,418
Open up.
We know you're in there.

332
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,419
- What do you want?
- To see the apartment.

333
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,917
- Which one?
- This one.

334
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,752
- Why?
- To rent it.

335
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,169
The real estate agency sent us.

336
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,835
In that case--

337
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:47,588
Come in. The owner
will be back in a minute.

338
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:53,669
- Carlos.
- Yes, honey?

339
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:56,003
It's too high.

340
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:58,003
Darling, it's a penthouse.

341
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:00,837
- And expensive.
- Super-expensive.

342
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,628
But it's a great location.

343
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,504
I want a real house,
and this is not a real house.

344
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,169
The girl is right.

345
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:11,503
Don't call me a girl.

346
00:34:15,585 --> 00:34:17,503
Carlos.

347
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:19,170
Yes, my love?

348
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:21,170
You call this great too?

349
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:22,669
Christ.

350
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,670
Pepa is really something.

351
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:31,588
Let's go. Come on.

352
00:34:35,586 --> 00:34:38,839
Drop that! You're a cop, right?

353
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:40,920
My Carlos a cop?
Very funny!

354
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:42,462
I'm no cop.

355
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:44,087
Isn't that your father?

356
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,963
Nice people don't touch
what is not theirs.

357
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:48,463
Why is this here?

358
00:34:48,502 --> 00:34:49,962
I don't know.

359
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:53,465
- Do you know her?
- That's Pepa.

360
00:34:53,502 --> 00:34:55,296
You know Pepa?

361
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:57,422
Not personally, no.

362
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,963
Well, here I am.

363
00:35:01,587 --> 00:35:03,130
You know who I am?

364
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:06,297
Did you see the bed?

365
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:08,964
I think so, ma'am.
You know who I am?

366
00:35:09,004 --> 00:35:12,674
Since last night.
But don't call me ma'am.

367
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:15,464
Ivan sent you for his bag?

368
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:18,590
- No, the realtor sent us.
- What a coincidence.

369
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,965
I'm glad to meet you anyway.

370
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:24,465
- This is Marisa.
- Who?

371
00:35:24,504 --> 00:35:25,964
Oh, hello.

372
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:27,505
I'm his fiancée.

373
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:30,466
Very nice.
I'm his father's ex-lover.

374
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:31,964
Pepa, listen--

375
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,465
This is Candela.

376
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,298
Pleased to meet you.

377
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:36,422
Carlos, please.

378
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:39,466
Pardon the mess.
My life's been hectic lately.

379
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:43,548
Can you fix telephones?

380
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:45,715
I... can try.

381
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,923
Come with me.

382
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:51,090
This one's out of order...

383
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:54,091
and I'm expecting a call
from your dad.

384
00:35:54,172 --> 00:35:56,090
Candela, make some coffee.

385
00:35:56,172 --> 00:35:57,423
We have to go.

386
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:59,424
Yeah. Good idea.

387
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:01,549
Don't be rude.
This is my house.

388
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:03,716
We've got to talk.

389
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:05,382
It can't be that urgent!

390
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:07,382
- Have you any tools?
- Yes, in the kitchen.

391
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,300
I'll go get them.

392
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:12,841
Is this any time for repairs?

393
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,051
Don't you recognize her?

394
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:20,301
She was in the phone booth
last night.

395
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:23,050
I hadn't noticed.

396
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:27,551
If you don't want me here, say so.

397
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:29,592
Who says I don't?

398
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:32,927
I just learned
that my ex-lover has a son.

399
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:34,759
And he's here.

400
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,550
Shouldn't he come first?

401
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:38,593
But I've got a big problem.

402
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:40,885
Okay, we'll talk.

403
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,635
Let me know when we're leaving.

404
00:36:45,716 --> 00:36:47,301
It won't take long.

405
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:48,884
Here.

406
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:51,968
Where's Ivan?

407
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,468
I don't know.

408
00:36:53,549 --> 00:36:56,636
Why doesn't he call?
I need to talk to him.

409
00:36:56,716 --> 00:36:58,635
I don't see him very much.

410
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,637
Don't lie.
He's taking a trip with your mom.

411
00:37:02,717 --> 00:37:07,388
My mother thinks
he's going with you.

412
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,886
Then it's someone else.

413
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:13,888
So that's why
he didn't sleep at his studio!

414
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:18,847
- How do you know?
- I spent all night keeping watch.

415
00:37:18,926 --> 00:37:20,344
You must think I'm crazy.

416
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:24,931
No. You're just nervous
from a lack of sleep.

417
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,802
You didn't know about me?

418
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:29,136
Never. I had no idea.

419
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:31,303
Ivan never tells me anything.

420
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:33,303
I just find things out.

421
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:37,639
Last night,
when I saw your picture--

422
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:40,137
"From your dad,
who doesn't deserve you. Ivan."

423
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:42,179
That's how I knew.

424
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:46,263
He never says anything,
never admits anything...

425
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,596
never criticizes.

426
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:52,096
Do you think I didn't know
he was cheating?

427
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:55,096
Sure, but I put up with it.

428
00:37:55,177 --> 00:37:59,097
I tried talking to him civilly,
but it didn't work.

429
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:04,097
So I begged him not to lie
about important things...

430
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:07,765
and to tell me
if he stopped loving me.

431
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:12,473
Last week, I finally got him
to admit he didn't love me.

432
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:15,472
It was like pulling teeth.

433
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:20,016
Thanks for listening,
since your father wouldn't.

434
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:23,847
Waiting for his call
had me ready to choke myself...

435
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,056
with the telephone cord.

436
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,599
- So I ripped out the phone.
- You did right.

437
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:32,973
She's gonna jump!

438
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:34,764
Your friend's jumping!

439
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:39,139
She jumped!

440
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:41,222
Help!

441
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:43,389
Carlos, be careful!

442
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:50,516
Don't let go of me, Pepa!

443
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:54,517
Oh, my God! I can't do it.

444
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:56,598
Come on! Pull!

445
00:39:10,263 --> 00:39:12,349
You could have killed yourself!

446
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,766
That was the idea!

447
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:18,015
I'm desperate.

448
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:21,810
So am l, and I don't go
jumping off terraces.

449
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:25,684
Young people don't know
how to fight for things.

450
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:28,683
You think life is all pleasure.

451
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:30,349
Well, it isn't.

452
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:33,309
You have to suffer a lot.

453
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:37,352
Pepa, please.
This isn't the right time.

454
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:39,809
Yes. I'm sorry.

455
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:41,475
It's because you scared me.

456
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:44,226
- Ivan--
- Yes?

457
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:47,936
I mean Carlos. Bring me
my tranquilizers from the kitchen.

458
00:39:55,932 --> 00:39:58,017
I'm in big trouble.

459
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,184
I can see that.

460
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,684
Carlos, do you love me?

461
00:40:02,766 --> 00:40:04,851
Please, not now.

462
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:10,684
Okay, what's wrong?

463
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:14,853
Three months ago,
I spent a weekend with a guy.

464
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:19,854
I didn't know his name or anything,
but after he left...

465
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:22,519
I couldn't get him out of my mind.

466
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,185
What happened that weekend?

467
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:28,187
Nothing special.
We fucked the whole weekend.

468
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:32,687
Just thinking about it
gives me goose bumps.

469
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,853
It was like a revelation.

470
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,229
Like making love
for the first time.

471
00:40:41,975 --> 00:40:43,394
I loved it.

472
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:46,437
Sex means a lot at your age.

473
00:40:48,017 --> 00:40:50,603
Because his life
is always in danger...

474
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:53,646
he's more intense
than other guys.

475
00:40:54,434 --> 00:40:57,437
I knew he'd be back,
and I'd agree to anything.

476
00:40:57,476 --> 00:40:59,478
He came back?

477
00:40:59,518 --> 00:41:02,437
Two weeks ago...
with two more guys.

478
00:41:02,477 --> 00:41:06,272
- You let them all stay?
- They were with him.

479
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:10,146
- They took advantage.
- Wait, wait.

480
00:41:10,185 --> 00:41:13,146
I noticed something weird about them...

481
00:41:13,185 --> 00:41:16,146
and he confessed
that they were Shiite terrorists.

482
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:18,646
I flipped. I really did.

483
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:22,147
I knew it could be dangerous,
but I didn't think about it.

484
00:41:22,186 --> 00:41:24,981
What's worse, they had weapons...

485
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:27,105
and were planning
to attack somewhere.

486
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:28,980
Then I said to him...

487
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:32,106
"You should have
told me about this."

488
00:41:32,186 --> 00:41:34,271
That's when I realized it was a ploy.

489
00:41:34,353 --> 00:41:37,272
He didn't love me. He used me.

490
00:41:39,144 --> 00:41:40,980
Gazpacho.

491
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:45,230
You didn't call the cops?

492
00:41:45,312 --> 00:41:46,689
Delicious.

493
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,857
How could l?
I was a hostage in my own house.

494
00:41:50,937 --> 00:41:53,314
- They were arrested yesterday?
- Yes.

495
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:58,234
- The ones on TV?
- I threw out all their stuff...

496
00:41:58,312 --> 00:42:00,231
but if they confess
where they were living--

497
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:02,690
If they're tortured,
they might tell.

498
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,482
They probably won't tell.

499
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:09,066
But if they do, the cops will
want me for collaborating...

500
00:42:09,146 --> 00:42:11,524
and you for not alerting them.

501
00:42:11,604 --> 00:42:14,774
In my house,
I collaborate with whomever I want.

502
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:16,898
I didn't know where to go.

503
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,732
I couldn't face my folks.

504
00:42:19,813 --> 00:42:22,315
It's bad enough
that I became a model.

505
00:42:22,397 --> 00:42:25,233
You need to see a lawyer.

506
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:28,733
I'll arrange for that.
You can't leave now.

507
00:42:28,814 --> 00:42:31,191
- Go to Paulina Morales.
- The feminist?

508
00:42:31,272 --> 00:42:33,315
A feminist?

509
00:42:33,397 --> 00:42:36,733
As a woman,
she'll take a personal interest.

510
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:40,192
I'll go change.
Then give me her address.

511
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,234
Why are men like that?

512
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:54,650
I really don't understand.

513
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:58,151
I couldn't stand to be
with a man right now.

514
00:42:58,232 --> 00:43:00,150
That's all I needed!

515
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:13,984
Help me!

516
00:43:14,065 --> 00:43:16,818
- What happened?
- Nothing. She fell asleep.

517
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:18,317
So suddenly?

518
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:22,361
The strangest things
can happen suddenly.

519
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,818
You should know, Candela.

520
00:43:24,899 --> 00:43:26,818
It's true.

521
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:28,317
But a minute ago--

522
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,820
A minute ago
she wanted to go home...

523
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:34,151
but since you ignored her...

524
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:36,402
she got depressed
and had some gazpacho.

525
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,777
That made her fall asleep?

526
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:43,404
Yes. It was spiked with barbiturates.

527
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:48,360
Sorry.

528
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:50,277
We could call a doctor.

529
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:55,445
- What kind of barbiturates?
- Morphidal.

530
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:58,153
- How many?
- Twenty-five or thirty.

531
00:43:58,234 --> 00:44:00,987
She'll have a good sleep.

532
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:16,613
Why did you do that?
Were you trying to kill yourself too?

533
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:21,446
It was for your dad.
He loves gazpacho.

534
00:44:21,485 --> 00:44:23,946
It's no excuse...

535
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:28,614
but after waiting for hours,
I just lost control.

536
00:44:28,652 --> 00:44:30,612
That's what happened to me.

537
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:32,654
It could happen to anyone.

538
00:44:36,652 --> 00:44:38,946
Don't get me wrong.

539
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:43,699
I didn't want to kill him--
just to make him stay.

540
00:44:43,777 --> 00:44:47,030
I meant to throw it, but--

541
00:44:47,111 --> 00:44:49,029
I understand perfectly.

542
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:51,864
Thanks. The lawyer's address?

543
00:44:51,945 --> 00:44:53,864
Thirty-one Castellana.

544
00:44:53,945 --> 00:44:55,864
Do you mind staying?

545
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:58,364
The house is so full of women.

546
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:02,031
- I'll stay as long as you like.
- Thanks. And fix the phone?

547
00:45:02,112 --> 00:45:05,532
- Are you okay?
- A bit shaken, but--

548
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:07,864
Don't let her near the ledge.
See you later.

549
00:45:07,945 --> 00:45:09,780
Forget it.

550
00:45:21,612 --> 00:45:23,448
Hi, Ana.

551
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,199
Look what fell down from the sky.

552
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,032
It's mine. Thanks.

553
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:35,823
It seemed strange--Just one.

554
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:38,990
Be more careful!

555
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,615
Ana was arguing with her boyfriend...

556
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,408
and it almost hit her head.

557
00:45:53,364 --> 00:45:55,658
- You again!
- Hope you don't mind.

558
00:45:55,697 --> 00:45:57,323
Thirty-one Castellana.

559
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:00,825
I'm glad to see you.

560
00:46:00,864 --> 00:46:03,324
My girlfriend loved the autograph.

561
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:07,535
When I tell her I saw you again,
she'll think we--

562
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:31,992
Do you have eye drops?

563
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:34,534
No. Sorry.

564
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:38,076
We could buy some.

565
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:39,492
That's okay.

566
00:46:39,574 --> 00:46:42,618
Why didn't I think of eyedrops?

567
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:44,659
What a dope!

568
00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:55,285
It's working.

569
00:46:56,658 --> 00:46:58,577
Forget about them.

570
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:03,079
But they're hijacking
the 10:00 P.M. Stockholm flight...

571
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:06,245
and taking it to Beirut
to free some Shiite prisoners.

572
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:10,580
That flight will be fully booked.
We must report it.

573
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:12,577
Then the cops will get me too!

574
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:16,746
I'll talk fast
so they can't trace the call.

575
00:47:16,826 --> 00:47:19,370
Yeah. You have a way with words.

576
00:47:26,993 --> 00:47:28,953
Police precinct. Hello.

577
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:32,746
Tonight's 10:00 P.M. flight...

578
00:47:32,826 --> 00:47:34,911
to Stockholm...

579
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:37,579
will be hijacked by Shiite terrorists.

580
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,911
Thanks.

581
00:47:58,077 --> 00:47:59,996
Here we are.

582
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,996
Don't tell anyone I cried.

583
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:03,996
It'll be our secret.

584
00:48:04,077 --> 00:48:05,579
Good.

585
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:14,081
- Here?
- Where it says "sign."

586
00:48:15,995 --> 00:48:17,997
Is Paulina Morales in?

587
00:48:18,078 --> 00:48:20,497
She's not seeing anyone this afternoon.

588
00:48:20,578 --> 00:48:23,831
It's urgent. It won't take long.

589
00:48:23,912 --> 00:48:26,414
Come on. You can arrange it.

590
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:29,915
- Okay. Come on.
- Thanks.

591
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:32,247
See you later.

592
00:48:37,245 --> 00:48:38,663
Wait here.

593
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,955
I'm coming.

594
00:48:43,996 --> 00:48:45,456
Can I use the phone?

595
00:48:45,496 --> 00:48:46,998
Okay.

596
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,458
Is Paulina there?

597
00:48:58,496 --> 00:49:00,165
Ivan?

598
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:04,498
I'm going crazy.

599
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,540
"Stockholm."

600
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,833
You can go in.

601
00:49:37,873 --> 00:49:41,210
- Of all the nerve!
- She said I could come in.

602
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,542
I'm in a hurry.

603
00:49:43,624 --> 00:49:47,628
Don't worry.
This won't take long.

604
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:50,792
May I sit down?

605
00:49:50,832 --> 00:49:52,792
Go ahead.

606
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:54,792
What's the problem?

607
00:49:54,832 --> 00:49:57,960
A friend of mine is in trouble.

608
00:49:57,999 --> 00:49:59,125
A "friend."

609
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:03,336
She got involved
with a Shiite terrorist.

610
00:50:04,832 --> 00:50:07,502
I'm dying to smoke. May l?

611
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,168
The shoe is hers.

612
00:50:14,208 --> 00:50:18,212
Anyway, he showed up
with two more Shiites.

613
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:19,502
Three Shiites.

614
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,461
All three just moved in.

615
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,460
Now they've been arrested...

616
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:27,128
and she's scared shitless.

617
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:29,794
So she needs a lawyer.

618
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,960
Why come to me?

619
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,711
- You're a feminist.
- So?

620
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:38,003
This is clear-cut chauvinism.

621
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:41,505
I'm going on a trip.
I'll recommend a colleague.

622
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:43,836
There's not much to be done.

623
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,962
She must turn herself in,
go to jail...

624
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:50,463
and let the jury decide her case.

625
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,214
- I don't understand.
- She's committed a crime.

626
00:50:55,293 --> 00:50:59,923
Her only crime was falling in love
and being afraid.

627
00:51:00,002 --> 00:51:01,962
I'd do the same.

628
00:51:02,002 --> 00:51:03,712
I'm sure.

629
00:51:04,877 --> 00:51:06,962
I don't believe this!

630
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:10,506
And whom were you crying for?
Your friend?

631
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:13,629
Not over her.

632
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,504
You see?

633
00:51:15,544 --> 00:51:17,338
Aren't you the victim?

634
00:51:17,377 --> 00:51:19,880
Yes. I've also been cheated on.

635
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,337
By a terrorist?

636
00:51:22,336 --> 00:51:24,254
You could say that.

637
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:26,713
But not a Shiite. He's from Madrid.

638
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:30,298
I don't give advice to the lovelorn.

639
00:51:30,377 --> 00:51:33,464
You're certainly no lawyer,
you bitch!

640
00:51:33,544 --> 00:51:36,005
Leave, or I'll call the police!

641
00:51:43,836 --> 00:51:45,296
Was it helpful?

642
00:51:45,337 --> 00:51:47,297
Yes. I feel much better.

643
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,797
Good.

644
00:51:53,504 --> 00:51:55,089
What's this doing here?

645
00:51:55,171 --> 00:51:58,424
A kid brought it
and said it's for Mr. Ivan.

646
00:51:58,504 --> 00:52:03,092
If he wants it, let him come upstairs
and show his face!

647
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:05,924
Fine. Do you need some help?

648
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:08,465
No, I don't!

649
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:14,092
Pepa, I'm here in Madrid with you.
That's all I need.

650
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:19,343
I'm also with you, and I'm so happy
to see you write this card. Pepa.

651
00:52:25,506 --> 00:52:27,174
He called?

652
00:52:31,005 --> 00:52:32,924
Yeah. I answered.

653
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:34,423
Well? Give me that!

654
00:52:34,506 --> 00:52:38,843
- I shouldn't read your postcards.
- Never mind. What did he say?

655
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:42,385
He's too embarrassed to see you,
because...

656
00:52:42,464 --> 00:52:44,383
you know who I am.

657
00:52:44,464 --> 00:52:46,007
How sensitive of him!

658
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,008
I don't want to see him either...

659
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,677
but if he wants his damn suitcase...

660
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:54,050
he'll have to come and get it!

661
00:52:54,131 --> 00:52:57,009
- How are the girls?
- Fine.

662
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,508
Where's Candela?

663
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,342
In your room.

664
00:53:00,423 --> 00:53:01,841
Did anything happen?

665
00:53:01,924 --> 00:53:05,344
No, no. Did you see the lawyer?

666
00:53:05,423 --> 00:53:08,510
Yes. I'll tell you about it later.

667
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,176
You mind my wearing your dress?

668
00:53:18,257 --> 00:53:21,344
Keep it. It looks nicer on you.

669
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:24,844
Don't lose it again.
My shoes don't fit you.

670
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:27,636
- You saw the lawyer?
- Yes.

671
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:30,635
We're taking a trip.

672
00:53:31,758 --> 00:53:35,387
Running from the law
like two fugitives?

673
00:53:35,466 --> 00:53:39,720
It's best if we take a vacation
away from Madrid.

674
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,718
I sure need one.

675
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,302
I knew they'd lock me up...

676
00:53:44,342 --> 00:53:46,302
and get you for hiding me.

677
00:53:46,342 --> 00:53:48,302
Nothing will happen.

678
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:50,469
We'll come back in a week.

679
00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:53,637
You'll go to court
and tell everything...

680
00:53:53,676 --> 00:53:56,303
except for the fucking,
and that'll be that.

681
00:53:56,342 --> 00:54:00,471
Really? Don't lie to me.
You know I'm naive.

682
00:54:00,509 --> 00:54:03,136
The lawyer said not to worry....

683
00:54:03,176 --> 00:54:06,972
just to stay in touch with her.

684
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:08,970
I'm causing so much trouble...

685
00:54:09,009 --> 00:54:12,137
as if you don't have
enough of your own.

686
00:54:12,176 --> 00:54:14,804
Let's water the plants now.

687
00:54:14,843 --> 00:54:16,971
Then we'll pack our bags.

688
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,887
"Dr. J. Pardo.

689
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:26,639
Test results on patient Pepa Marcos. "

690
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:28,303
Christ!

691
00:54:33,678 --> 00:54:36,472
- What about the animals?
- I don't know.

692
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:40,390
Your stepson was
snooping around all day, spying.

693
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:43,389
It's quite natural,
but he won't find much.

694
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:45,555
Relax. Let me do that.

695
00:54:45,636 --> 00:54:46,887
Why?

696
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:49,389
- You feel okay?
- Sure.

697
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:53,306
You two clean the cage
while I water.

698
00:54:57,554 --> 00:55:00,557
Poor things.
You're going to miss me.

699
00:55:00,637 --> 00:55:02,556
You're depressed.

700
00:55:02,637 --> 00:55:05,390
Just like me.

701
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:08,056
But you'll come along when I move.

702
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:10,056
I won't leave you alone.

703
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:13,641
I'd be a fine one to abandon you.

704
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:18,306
She's out cold. Let's see.

705
00:55:19,638 --> 00:55:23,809
Anyway, who cares?
Too bad for her.

706
00:55:26,304 --> 00:55:27,889
Poor bunnies!

707
00:55:27,972 --> 00:55:29,723
Look. Totally dry.

708
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:32,057
Pepa just has too much on her mind.

709
00:55:32,138 --> 00:55:35,058
Did you ever have rabbits?

710
00:55:35,138 --> 00:55:38,141
Back home I had many.

711
00:55:38,222 --> 00:55:40,182
I know lots about them.

712
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:45,183
Look how they love turnips.

713
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:49,685
Carlos, I'm sorry I teased you
about your stuttering.

714
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:52,517
- Sometimes I'm so dumb.
- Forget it.

715
00:55:52,556 --> 00:55:54,641
But you went a little too far.

716
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:57,308
You didn't behave properly.

717
00:55:57,389 --> 00:56:00,851
Men keep taking advantage of me.

718
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:04,351
I always realize it when it's too late.

719
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:09,687
Look how the Arab world treated me.

720
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:12,267
I sure didn't deserve that.

721
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:23,351
This is Lucia.
I need to see you.

722
00:56:23,431 --> 00:56:26,017
I can't. I'm leaving town.

723
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:27,767
We have to talk.

724
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:30,685
About something
that concerns us both.

725
00:56:30,723 --> 00:56:34,060
If you mean Ivan,
I'm not interested.

726
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,643
Then why are you
going away with him?

727
00:56:36,683 --> 00:56:38,393
Lady, you're nuts!

728
00:56:38,474 --> 00:56:41,978
Between Ivan and me,
there's nothing but pain.

729
00:56:42,016 --> 00:56:45,478
I'm coming anyway.
I know where you live.

730
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:49,145
For two days everyone
has been saying "no" to me.

731
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:51,561
Now it's my turn to say "no."

732
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:56,146
I must see Ivan
before he leaves.

733
00:56:56,225 --> 00:56:59,562
Look somewhere else
and leave me alone!

734
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:00,977
- That was Mom?
- Yes.

735
00:57:01,016 --> 00:57:02,810
Don't be too hard on her.

736
00:57:02,851 --> 00:57:04,769
The way she talks--

737
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:07,228
She's mentally ill.

738
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:09,519
She threatened to come here.

739
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,145
- She shouldn't see you.
- And me?

740
00:57:12,184 --> 00:57:16,063
Fix Marisa some coffee.
We need to talk.

741
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:19,229
The lawyer didn't work out.
We got into a fight.

742
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:20,978
She won't defend her?

743
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:23,937
She'd rather prosecute her.
How'd you meet her?

744
00:57:24,017 --> 00:57:25,352
She was Mom's lawyer.

745
00:57:25,435 --> 00:57:28,187
I'm not surprised
your mother is sick.

746
00:57:29,268 --> 00:57:32,062
They split up before I was born.

747
00:57:32,143 --> 00:57:34,103
After my birth, she went crazy...

748
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,019
and was placed
in a mental institution.

749
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,854
My grandparents raised me.

750
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:42,147
They wouldn't let Ivan see me.

751
00:57:42,185 --> 00:57:43,812
You can look now.

752
00:57:47,686 --> 00:57:49,563
Mom was released a year ago.

753
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:53,857
When she got out,
she wanted to go back to Ivan...

754
00:57:53,936 --> 00:57:56,313
but he was with you.

755
00:57:56,352 --> 00:57:58,396
Can you zip me up?

756
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:02,522
So she sued him for millions...

757
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:06,023
for all the time
she'd been locked up.

758
00:58:06,103 --> 00:58:07,813
Paulina was her lawyer.

759
00:58:07,853 --> 00:58:09,813
Your mother doesn't mess around.

760
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,690
Paulina tried to sue Ivan,
but it didn't work.

761
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:15,689
What an insane story.

762
00:58:15,729 --> 00:58:17,564
Mom hates me.

763
00:58:17,645 --> 00:58:21,315
I represent all her years
without Ivan.

764
00:58:21,353 --> 00:58:23,272
Well, I love you.

765
00:58:23,353 --> 00:58:26,606
You're the only good thing
Ivan ever did.

766
00:58:29,562 --> 00:58:33,357
- Oh, it's you.
- I didn't want to interrupt.

767
00:58:33,438 --> 00:58:36,691
- Why so dressed up?
- I'm going out.

768
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:38,605
Don't mention the lawyer.

769
00:58:38,688 --> 00:58:41,649
- What?
- See if you can wake up Marisa.

770
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:44,441
- And if not?
- It's up to you.

771
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,357
- Anyway, we're leaving.
- What?

772
00:58:47,438 --> 00:58:48,772
- On a trip.
- Where?

773
00:58:48,855 --> 00:58:50,773
- It's a secret.
- We're fugitives.

774
00:58:50,855 --> 00:58:53,482
It's better if you don't know.

775
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:56,357
- But he knows everything.
- Come on.

776
00:59:03,605 --> 00:59:05,149
What if Ivan calls?

777
00:59:06,397 --> 00:59:09,275
Tell him I expect nothing
from him.

778
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:12,150
All I have left from him
is the suitcase...

779
00:59:12,188 --> 00:59:14,107
and I'm getting rid of it now.

780
00:59:15,355 --> 00:59:19,026
No. Don't say anything.

781
00:59:19,106 --> 00:59:20,858
Don't get the phone...

782
00:59:20,939 --> 00:59:21,982
or the door.

783
00:59:22,064 --> 00:59:23,316
Fine.

784
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:26,275
I'll be right back.

785
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:36,944
I overheard about your mom,
and I'm really sorry.

786
00:59:39,024 --> 00:59:40,900
You're a kissing fanatic!

787
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:43,818
Let's give her some coffee.

788
00:59:56,024 --> 00:59:57,692
What's wrong?

789
00:59:57,774 --> 01:00:00,152
Nothing. She's having fun.

790
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:04,193
I've never seen her like this.

791
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:07,278
Don't wake her.
She's having a great time.

792
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:09,152
See her face?

793
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:11,319
She's having a ball.

794
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,902
Her face!

795
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,735
Look at her lip!

796
01:00:26,817 --> 01:00:30,321
Hi. I've come for my bag.
Pepa said it was here.

797
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:35,448
That's strange.
A kid brought it down earlier...

798
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:38,487
but when Pepa saw it,
she threw a fit.

799
01:00:38,526 --> 01:00:43,156
- So where's the bag?
- She took it and she said...

800
01:00:43,234 --> 01:00:45,862
"If he wants it,
let him come and get it...

801
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,528
and show his face!"

802
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,695
That's what she said.

803
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:51,278
She's upstairs now.

804
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,570
I'm in a hurry.

805
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,446
She's probably calmed down...

806
01:00:57,526 --> 01:00:59,361
but you never know.

807
01:00:59,402 --> 01:01:02,071
I'll be back tomorrow.
Don't tell her I was here.

808
01:01:02,152 --> 01:01:06,823
Sir, I'm a Jehovah's Witness
and cannot tell lies.

809
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:10,489
Only the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

810
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:11,945
But if she doesn't ask--

811
01:01:12,028 --> 01:01:14,906
If she asks,
I have to tell the gospel truth.

812
01:01:14,986 --> 01:01:16,613
Good-bye.

813
01:01:16,694 --> 01:01:18,070
I'd like to lie!

814
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:21,323
The bad thing
about my religion is...

815
01:01:21,403 --> 01:01:23,489
that we can't.

816
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:35,617
I love the sound of the trumpets
on Judgment Day

817
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:41,657
Ivan, I have to speak
to you immediately.

818
01:01:41,737 --> 01:01:45,240
Leave a message
and tell me when and where.

819
01:01:47,196 --> 01:01:49,031
I can't pick up my bag.

820
01:01:49,112 --> 01:01:51,531
I wanted to talk to you...

821
01:01:51,571 --> 01:01:54,824
but I see you're avoiding me.

822
01:01:54,862 --> 01:01:58,073
I'll try again in a few days...

823
01:01:58,154 --> 01:02:00,531
when you're a bit calmer.

824
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:03,991
I want you to know
that our years together...

825
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:07,492
were the best of my life.

826
01:02:08,863 --> 01:02:11,491
I'm not going away
with any woman.

827
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,032
Good-bye, sweetheart.

828
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:19,283
I wish you the best
with all my heart.

829
01:02:19,363 --> 01:02:24,494
I'm so unhappy

830
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,950
Because you no longer love me

831
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:31,868
Why should I try
to change your mind

832
01:02:33,864 --> 01:02:38,660
Be happy, my love

833
01:02:38,697 --> 01:02:46,163
For I'll never forget
the love you gave me

834
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:51,410
I'm so unhappy

835
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:57,118
Look at him!

836
01:02:57,199 --> 01:02:58,784
He's nuts!

837
01:03:12,115 --> 01:03:13,825
I'll show her, all right!

838
01:03:13,866 --> 01:03:17,369
Pepa, you'll pay dearly
for those three Shiites!

839
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:21,660
I'm not going away
with any women.

840
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:24,118
Good-bye, sweetheart.
I wish you the best--

841
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,035
Liar!

842
01:03:26,075 --> 01:03:27,618
Maybe it's true.

843
01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:30,077
He can fool me with everything
but his voice.

844
01:03:30,158 --> 01:03:34,746
I know all his intonations.
I worked long enough with him.

845
01:03:34,825 --> 01:03:36,702
Goddamn phone!

846
01:03:37,575 --> 01:03:39,410
What were you doing?

847
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:43,203
That damn fucking bitch!

848
01:03:43,242 --> 01:03:45,536
What did you see in her?

849
01:03:45,575 --> 01:03:47,827
Let's get your luggage.

850
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:49,535
- You did it again.
- Forget it.

851
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:53,371
Calm down!
Just look at this place.

852
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:58,120
- The cops!
- Take it easy. Come on.

853
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,578
It's Ivan.
I knew he's no coward.

854
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:02,745
It's your mother.

855
01:04:02,826 --> 01:04:04,078
- Let's play.
- I can't!

856
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:06,161
- Should I let her in?
- Yes.

857
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:09,204
- Read the instructions!
- "Strategy is--"

858
01:04:09,243 --> 01:04:10,953
Not out loud!

859
01:04:14,202 --> 01:04:17,246
What are you doing here,
traitor?

860
01:04:17,327 --> 01:04:20,205
- Well--
- Carlos, who is it?

861
01:04:20,243 --> 01:04:21,745
I don't know.

862
01:04:21,827 --> 01:04:23,204
It's the police.

863
01:04:24,993 --> 01:04:26,453
What do they want?

864
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:31,456
We understood.

865
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:33,746
- Come on.
- Right.

866
01:04:34,702 --> 01:04:37,163
Shut up or I'll smack you.

867
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:44,829
Good evening.

868
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:47,497
Is she with you?

869
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:49,580
We met in the elevator.

870
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:59,331
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

871
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:03,124
-Just discussing the lady's dress.
- It's awful.

872
01:05:03,204 --> 01:05:05,831
- It's just a dress.
- But it's awful.

873
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,372
Maybe she likes it.

874
01:05:07,412 --> 01:05:12,000
Stop acting like a kid
in front of the policemen!

875
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:18,207
"I love you, need you, want you."

876
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:21,498
"Your Ivan."

877
01:05:21,537 --> 01:05:23,957
May I ask why you're here?

878
01:05:24,038 --> 01:05:26,540
A call was made
from your telephone...

879
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:28,206
about some terrorists.

880
01:05:28,288 --> 01:05:30,207
Pardon?

881
01:05:30,288 --> 01:05:34,876
Someone called from here
about the Shiite terrorists.

882
01:05:34,955 --> 01:05:36,998
See! I told you!

883
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,207
Those kids!

884
01:05:39,288 --> 01:05:44,335
There's been some mistake. My phone's
been out of order all day.

885
01:05:44,413 --> 01:05:46,457
She just now pulled it out.

886
01:05:46,538 --> 01:05:48,916
I called her 20 minutes ago.

887
01:05:48,997 --> 01:05:51,041
Ignore her. She's a bit crazy.

888
01:05:51,122 --> 01:05:54,209
- What am I charged with?
- Nothing.

889
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:57,834
We just wanted information
about who called.

890
01:05:57,914 --> 01:05:59,290
Who ripped out the phone?

891
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:01,583
I did. This morning.

892
01:06:01,665 --> 01:06:03,792
So nobody's called
from here today.

893
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:05,959
Pepa's some talker!

894
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,208
Why?

895
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:11,043
I was expecting a call.
They didn't call, and I got upset.

896
01:06:11,082 --> 01:06:13,668
Who? Ivan? Where is he?

897
01:06:13,706 --> 01:06:17,043
Shut up. I'll ask the questions.
Well... we will.

898
01:06:17,082 --> 01:06:19,918
Go ahead. Ask her who Ivan is.

899
01:06:19,998 --> 01:06:22,876
- Who's Ivan?
- The cause of this mess...

900
01:06:22,957 --> 01:06:25,501
and of the mess
your partner's about to see.

901
01:06:27,207 --> 01:06:29,042
He's going to find Marisa.

902
01:06:29,123 --> 01:06:30,333
All right. Explain.

903
01:06:30,374 --> 01:06:32,501
May I sit down?

904
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:37,461
If I'm to bare my soul,
I'd rather be comfortable.

905
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:39,501
I've had a hard day.

906
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,042
Are you comfortable?

907
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,710
I'd be more comfortable
alone with my friends...

908
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,334
playing Strategy.

909
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:48,002
You can't always
have everything.

910
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:49,918
We agree on that.

911
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:52,627
Who is this Ivan?

912
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:56,838
He was my lover.
Before that he was with her.

913
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:59,419
He's my son's father.

914
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,877
Him?
What's he doing here?

915
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:04,127
He came to rent my apartment.

916
01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:05,335
I didn't know.

917
01:07:05,376 --> 01:07:08,671
I get the feeling
you're pulling my leg.

918
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:12,170
You think I like
baring my soul to strangers?

919
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:15,337
Well, you're wrong.
It's humiliating.

920
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:17,169
Damn it, Mom!

921
01:07:17,209 --> 01:07:19,753
- Candela, get me a drink.
- What kind?

922
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:22,504
- There's gazpacho.
- Right! Gazpacho!

923
01:07:22,543 --> 01:07:24,044
Let's go.

924
01:07:25,835 --> 01:07:28,671
- Where are you going?
- For gazpacho. Want some?

925
01:07:28,709 --> 01:07:31,629
We're on duty,
but we don't want to be rude--

926
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:34,045
Gazpacho for everyone.

927
01:07:34,085 --> 01:07:36,295
Is she sleeping?

928
01:07:36,377 --> 01:07:39,171
Like a log.
She's Carlos' fiancée.

929
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:42,547
She was tired.
You want me to wake her up?

930
01:07:42,627 --> 01:07:44,337
Not yet.

931
01:07:44,418 --> 01:07:48,339
Why don't you sit down?
I'm getting a stiff neck.

932
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,963
We have nothing against you--

933
01:07:59,044 --> 01:08:00,504
Thanks a lot.

934
01:08:00,586 --> 01:08:03,506
Without being inquisitive...

935
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:06,131
you must admit
this is a little weird.

936
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:08,213
A charred bedroom...

937
01:08:08,294 --> 01:08:10,004
a broken phone,
a smashed window--

938
01:08:10,045 --> 01:08:12,631
It's been weird, all right.

939
01:08:12,711 --> 01:08:15,172
Okay. Start at the beginning.

940
01:08:15,212 --> 01:08:17,548
And make it clear,
concise, and fair.

941
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:18,838
I don't know if I can.

942
01:08:18,878 --> 01:08:22,006
I'm too hurt to be clear,
concise, and fair.

943
01:08:22,045 --> 01:08:23,004
Words!

944
01:08:23,045 --> 01:08:26,257
-Just the facts.
- Okay.

945
01:08:26,337 --> 01:08:28,798
I lived here... with Ivan.

946
01:08:28,879 --> 01:08:32,508
We loved each other.
At least, I loved him.

947
01:08:32,546 --> 01:08:36,466
After months of trying
to keep our love together...

948
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,673
we split up a week ago.

949
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:44,300
He told me to pack his bags.
He'd be taking a trip...

950
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:46,048
with another woman.

951
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,966
- He said that?
- He never travels alone.

952
01:08:49,046 --> 01:08:52,883
Remember, these two
for the cops. An extra dose.

953
01:08:52,922 --> 01:08:54,757
Careful.

954
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,757
This is too warm.

955
01:08:59,964 --> 01:09:01,507
Carlos, my God!

956
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:05,426
In front of your mother,
the cops, your fiancée!

957
01:09:05,505 --> 01:09:06,840
Aren't you afraid?

958
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,049
Go on, please.

959
01:09:09,131 --> 01:09:11,967
So I packed up his stuff
and went to work.

960
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,883
When I came back,
the house was like this.

961
01:09:14,964 --> 01:09:17,675
Except for the phone,
which I did.

962
01:09:17,756 --> 01:09:20,384
The suitcase was gone...

963
01:09:20,464 --> 01:09:23,217
and the bed was all burned.

964
01:09:23,297 --> 01:09:28,010
They're taking very long.
Go. Check.

965
01:09:29,548 --> 01:09:32,384
They're probably kissing.

966
01:09:32,424 --> 01:09:34,884
- What about Marisa?
- She'd better wake up.

967
01:09:34,965 --> 01:09:37,384
Takes after his father.

968
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:40,884
- Now, who's that?
- Yeah?

969
01:09:40,923 --> 01:09:43,009
- Telephone repair. And you?
- Police.

970
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:45,843
- Your I.D.?
- And yours?

971
01:09:54,133 --> 01:09:56,010
Are you the lady
who called this morning?

972
01:09:56,049 --> 01:10:00,012
Yes. Here's the phone,
and here's the plug.

973
01:10:00,091 --> 01:10:03,302
I reached her here by phone
20 minutes ago.

974
01:10:03,383 --> 01:10:05,051
There she goes again!

975
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:07,093
Not on this phone.

976
01:10:07,174 --> 01:10:08,968
Let's get to the point.

977
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:12,971
Do you know
any Shiite terrorists?

978
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:15,594
Shut up! He's asking her!

979
01:10:15,675 --> 01:10:18,052
I didn't know Madrid had any.

980
01:10:19,384 --> 01:10:20,927
Do you know them?

981
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:24,304
Not me. I'm not into politics.

982
01:10:24,384 --> 01:10:26,469
Sure, man.
They were on TV today!

983
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:29,637
- Shut up!
- You want the TV on?

984
01:10:29,718 --> 01:10:32,595
I'm not interested in Shiites.

985
01:10:32,676 --> 01:10:34,177
Ma'am, what about you?

986
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:37,846
Pepa and I have
important things to discuss.

987
01:10:37,884 --> 01:10:39,052
Men, right?

988
01:10:39,135 --> 01:10:40,469
What's more important?

989
01:10:40,551 --> 01:10:42,845
Fine. We'll talk about men.

990
01:10:45,676 --> 01:10:48,679
Is Ivan involved
with these terrorists?

991
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:54,014
- Relax.
- Ivan?

992
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:56,637
I don't know.
He's hidden so many things from me.

993
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,554
Can you give me his address...

994
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,262
or phone number?

995
01:11:01,343 --> 01:11:05,264
He has no phone.
And he's not home.

996
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,513
I told you he's leaving town.

997
01:11:07,594 --> 01:11:09,178
Try the airport.

998
01:11:10,094 --> 01:11:13,097
The airport? Where's he going?

999
01:11:37,512 --> 01:11:39,139
Where is he going?

1000
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:43,141
To Stockholm... tonight.
With Paulina Morales.

1001
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:45,264
Stockholm!

1002
01:11:45,345 --> 01:11:47,764
Why didn't you say so before?

1003
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:50,515
Because I just figured it out.

1004
01:11:51,512 --> 01:11:54,557
Now I understand it all--

1005
01:11:54,637 --> 01:11:56,264
The phone call.

1006
01:11:56,346 --> 01:12:00,142
What an idiot I am!
Why didn't I see it before?

1007
01:12:01,555 --> 01:12:03,932
Your lawyer
played it beautifully.

1008
01:12:04,013 --> 01:12:07,808
You didn't know
they'd be hijacking that flight?

1009
01:12:10,054 --> 01:12:11,681
The Shiites?

1010
01:12:15,055 --> 01:12:19,018
The whole country knows.
It was on TV.

1011
01:12:19,055 --> 01:12:21,641
But the tip
came from this phone.

1012
01:12:21,722 --> 01:12:24,516
I want to know
who the hell called...

1013
01:12:24,556 --> 01:12:27,017
or I'll haul you all in!

1014
01:12:28,264 --> 01:12:31,058
Why aren't you at the airport?

1015
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:34,601
There are more cops there
than passengers.

1016
01:12:35,681 --> 01:12:38,267
I don't know what's going on...

1017
01:12:38,347 --> 01:12:40,474
but if you don't start talking--

1018
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:43,350
Chief, this stuff has been spiked.

1019
01:12:45,931 --> 01:12:47,975
What's in the gazpacho?

1020
01:12:48,056 --> 01:12:50,893
Tomatoes, cucumbers...

1021
01:12:50,973 --> 01:12:53,893
bell pepper, onion...

1022
01:12:53,973 --> 01:12:55,516
one garlic clove...

1023
01:12:57,515 --> 01:13:00,894
oil, salt, vinegar...

1024
01:13:00,932 --> 01:13:03,393
some day-old bread, and water.

1025
01:13:03,474 --> 01:13:06,101
The secret's in mixing it right.

1026
01:13:06,183 --> 01:13:08,935
Ivan loves the way I mix it.

1027
01:13:09,016 --> 01:13:10,350
I made it for him.

1028
01:13:12,057 --> 01:13:13,851
You collect weapons?

1029
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:14,892
Get back!

1030
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:19,479
Move back. I don't want
to hurt the kids.

1031
01:13:19,558 --> 01:13:22,269
Is Ivan really going
to Stockholm?

1032
01:13:22,349 --> 01:13:25,186
It's just a hunch,
but I'm pretty sure.

1033
01:13:25,224 --> 01:13:27,518
What did you have to tell him?

1034
01:13:27,558 --> 01:13:29,727
Nothing, now.

1035
01:13:29,808 --> 01:13:32,769
I just want to forget him.

1036
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:35,686
And you should do the same.

1037
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:38,561
In the hospital,
I had forgotten him.

1038
01:13:38,601 --> 01:13:41,228
I didn't remember anything.

1039
01:13:41,309 --> 01:13:42,935
Until suddenly...

1040
01:13:43,017 --> 01:13:47,229
one night,
I heard his voice on TV.

1041
01:13:47,309 --> 01:13:49,269
I didn't recognize his face...

1042
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,478
just his voice.

1043
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:53,770
He was telling a woman
he loved her.

1044
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:57,772
I felt a spasm inside me.

1045
01:13:57,851 --> 01:14:01,396
I remembered all the times
he's said that to me.

1046
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:05,812
I regained my sanity
and my memory.

1047
01:14:05,893 --> 01:14:07,352
From that moment on...

1048
01:14:07,435 --> 01:14:10,772
I acted as if I had been cured...

1049
01:14:10,852 --> 01:14:12,979
and they released me.

1050
01:14:13,059 --> 01:14:15,854
If you're cured,
stop aiming at me.

1051
01:14:15,894 --> 01:14:19,981
But I'm not cured.

1052
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:23,272
I faked it, and I fooled them.

1053
01:14:23,352 --> 01:14:27,023
I can only forget him
by killing him.

1054
01:14:27,061 --> 01:14:30,147
How will you do that?

1055
01:14:30,227 --> 01:14:31,771
At the airport.

1056
01:14:31,852 --> 01:14:35,939
The airport is full of cops.
You heard him.

1057
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:37,604
I'll manage.

1058
01:14:38,352 --> 01:14:40,104
Now that you know--

1059
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:43,146
Let's drink a toast.

1060
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:56,605
Drink!

1061
01:14:57,395 --> 01:14:58,438
You too.

1062
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:12,231
Oh, my eyes!

1063
01:15:21,188 --> 01:15:22,397
My eyes!

1064
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:28,607
She left the door open!

1065
01:15:28,688 --> 01:15:30,690
The door!

1066
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:45,399
Take me to the airport,
please.

1067
01:15:45,481 --> 01:15:47,024
Sorry. I have a date.

1068
01:15:47,105 --> 01:15:48,732
Take me!

1069
01:15:48,814 --> 01:15:51,567
- What the hell is that?
- A gun. Let's go.

1070
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:53,358
My girlfriend will be mad.

1071
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,902
Not as mad as I'll be.
Quick, to Stockholm!

1072
01:16:07,398 --> 01:16:09,859
Right under my nose!

1073
01:16:09,939 --> 01:16:11,316
Did you see that?

1074
01:16:11,398 --> 01:16:13,275
Come on. After them!

1075
01:16:14,857 --> 01:16:16,567
You again! Great!

1076
01:16:16,649 --> 01:16:19,193
We're meant for each other!

1077
01:16:19,273 --> 01:16:21,108
Whom do we follow today?

1078
01:16:21,191 --> 01:16:23,526
- That motorcycle!
- That Harley!

1079
01:16:26,066 --> 01:16:27,943
I'll do my best.

1080
01:16:28,024 --> 01:16:29,525
To the airport!

1081
01:16:29,608 --> 01:16:31,777
Blow on my eyes.

1082
01:16:31,857 --> 01:16:35,527
That lady is crazy,
and she carries two guns.

1083
01:16:35,566 --> 01:16:39,070
- Why did she take Ambite?
- Because she's in a hurry.

1084
01:16:39,149 --> 01:16:42,152
Ah! Eye drops!

1085
01:16:42,232 --> 01:16:44,193
Anything else, ladies?

1086
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:48,363
No. Just step on it.
That lady is dangerous.

1087
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,445
No lady's dangerous
if you know how to handle her.

1088
01:16:51,525 --> 01:16:53,945
- There they are.
- I've got them.

1089
01:16:54,025 --> 01:16:54,943
I can't see.

1090
01:16:55,025 --> 01:16:58,320
He can never say "no."

1091
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,362
Ana, that lady has two guns,
and she's a nut.

1092
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,903
Look what she did to me!

1093
01:17:03,984 --> 01:17:07,154
You think I go around
like this for fun?

1094
01:17:07,233 --> 01:17:09,945
She's capable of anything!

1095
01:17:10,734 --> 01:17:14,029
My ass is the only one
allowed on that bike.

1096
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:16,403
I'm fed up.

1097
01:17:16,443 --> 01:17:18,987
I'm gonna get myself
some quick cash...

1098
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:20,569
buy myself his bike and split.

1099
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:21,986
With a bike...

1100
01:17:22,068 --> 01:17:24,028
who needs a man?

1101
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:27,071
Learning mechanics
is easier than learning male psychology.

1102
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:30,654
You can figure out a bike...

1103
01:17:30,735 --> 01:17:33,696
but you can never
figure out a man.

1104
01:17:34,735 --> 01:17:36,987
She's going for his balls!

1105
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:39,696
I think she's just
trying to hang on.

1106
01:17:39,777 --> 01:17:42,238
Fresh out of the mental ward...

1107
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:44,154
and she looks
like a professional biker.

1108
01:17:58,277 --> 01:18:01,239
Be careful! She's crazy!

1109
01:18:01,278 --> 01:18:02,655
And she has a gun!

1110
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:05,321
Bitch!

1111
01:18:05,403 --> 01:18:07,030
Get down!

1112
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:18,156
Shut up, idiot women!

1113
01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:27,405
Leave my man alone!

1114
01:18:47,571 --> 01:18:50,074
Can't you go any faster?

1115
01:18:50,113 --> 01:18:52,741
Lady, this thing is a relic.

1116
01:18:52,822 --> 01:18:55,825
A relic?
Just remember this gun!

1117
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:57,365
Okay! Don't shoot!

1118
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,241
Don't you sell guns?

1119
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,990
I don't need them.

1120
01:19:10,073 --> 01:19:11,908
What if you're held up?

1121
01:19:11,948 --> 01:19:13,866
I avoid danger, just like now.

1122
01:19:13,906 --> 01:19:17,701
Sorry, ladies.
The chase is over.

1123
01:19:17,739 --> 01:19:21,993
Please, just take us
to the airport somehow.

1124
01:19:22,073 --> 01:19:24,826
I'm a taxi driver,
not a bounty hunter.

1125
01:19:24,906 --> 01:19:27,617
I warned you
she was a dangerous woman.

1126
01:19:27,698 --> 01:19:29,492
He said he could deal.

1127
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:51,575
Right here.

1128
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,534
Thanks.

1129
01:20:02,449 --> 01:20:04,493
Stockholm, please?

1130
01:20:04,574 --> 01:20:07,035
International flights
are over there.

1131
01:20:54,077 --> 01:20:56,579
- You're weak, Ivan.
- Yes, sweetheart.

1132
01:20:56,660 --> 01:21:00,288
- Don't agree with me!
- But you're right.

1133
01:21:00,369 --> 01:21:03,539
Sometimes I like to be wrong.

1134
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:03,209
Take me back to the hospital.
That's my home.

1135
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,624
Are you all right?

1136
01:22:27,706 --> 01:22:29,749
Let go.

1137
01:22:29,831 --> 01:22:32,250
You saved my life, darling.

1138
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:36,085
Don't worry.
I don't want anything in return.

1139
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:38,750
Just one thing.
Tell her to go away!

1140
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:41,457
Go away!

1141
01:22:44,957 --> 01:22:47,543
Pepa, I'm ashamed.

1142
01:22:47,582 --> 01:22:50,876
I've treated you so badly.

1143
01:22:50,915 --> 01:22:53,084
All I wanted was to talk to you.

1144
01:22:53,165 --> 01:22:55,585
I've spent two days waiting...

1145
01:22:55,623 --> 01:22:58,459
looking for you,
leaving messages.

1146
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,501
We can talk tonight.

1147
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:02,626
The trip to Stockholm can wait.

1148
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:05,127
No. It's too late now.

1149
01:23:05,207 --> 01:23:06,709
Don't hold a grudge.

1150
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:10,545
Let's have a drink,
now, in the cafeteria.

1151
01:23:12,457 --> 01:23:14,501
Yesterday... this morning,
or even at noon today...

1152
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,418
we could have.

1153
01:23:16,457 --> 01:23:18,209
But now it's too late.

1154
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:20,794
It's been too late
for the past two hours.

1155
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:25,045
Then why did you come out here?

1156
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,295
Lucia wanted to kill you...

1157
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:32,504
and I came to stop her.

1158
01:23:32,584 --> 01:23:35,753
Since you're out of danger,
I'm leaving.

1159
01:23:37,458 --> 01:23:39,168
Good-bye.

1160
01:24:04,293 --> 01:24:06,044
Home at last!

1161
01:24:07,252 --> 01:24:09,254
The visitors...

1162
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:11,588
are comfortable.

1163
01:24:11,668 --> 01:24:14,087
And the kids?

1164
01:24:14,127 --> 01:24:17,589
Candela really manages
to recover quickly.

1165
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:20,380
Hope he's luckier for her
than the Shiites were.

1166
01:24:21,502 --> 01:24:23,296
God, what a mess!

1167
01:24:23,377 --> 01:24:25,546
The maid comes tomorrow.

1168
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:28,547
Better wear shoes
with this mess.

1169
01:24:28,586 --> 01:24:30,921
I wonder which is better...

1170
01:24:30,961 --> 01:24:34,798
slipping on gazpacho,
or cutting myself on the glass.

1171
01:24:34,878 --> 01:24:38,882
The repairman is a doll, but
I'd better save him for Marisa.

1172
01:24:48,336 --> 01:24:50,839
I fell asleep.

1173
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,255
How do you feel?

1174
01:24:52,336 --> 01:24:55,506
Like new. But you don't look so hot.

1175
01:24:55,587 --> 01:24:58,882
Well... I'm going to have a baby.

1176
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,547
I didn't know.

1177
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:02,797
You're the first person
I've told.

1178
01:25:02,879 --> 01:25:05,882
Congratulations!
You should sit here.

1179
01:25:11,588 --> 01:25:12,881
I'll explain tomorrow.

1180
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:14,923
- But--
- Sit down.

1181
01:25:15,005 --> 01:25:18,967
You just woke up,
but I haven't slept in two days.

1182
01:25:20,754 --> 01:25:23,090
I won't sublet it.

1183
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:24,882
I love the view.

1184
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:29,382
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

1185
01:25:31,714 --> 01:25:33,340
How long was I asleep?

1186
01:25:33,422 --> 01:25:35,215
Hours!

1187
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,466
You have beautiful skin.

1188
01:25:39,255 --> 01:25:41,674
I had a dream.

1189
01:25:41,756 --> 01:25:44,383
- A good one?
- I think so.

1190
01:25:46,214 --> 01:25:48,675
I was a virgin this morning...

1191
01:25:48,756 --> 01:25:50,424
but I don't think I am now.

1192
01:25:50,506 --> 01:25:54,469
- Don't tell me one of these jerks--
- No. It was in my dream!

1193
01:25:54,548 --> 01:25:56,550
Great!

1194
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:58,717
Actually, you've lost...

1195
01:25:58,757 --> 01:26:00,800
that hard look
that virgins have.

1196
01:26:00,882 --> 01:26:01,883
Virgins are awful.

1197
01:26:01,965 --> 01:26:11,099
If you were on stage
faking a cheap pain

1198
01:26:11,174 --> 01:26:14,093
Don't bother to act

1199
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:19,011
I know that play

1200
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,926
Liar

1201
01:26:22,007 --> 01:26:25,385
How well you fit that part

1202
01:26:26,299 --> 01:26:30,595
It would seem after all

1203
01:26:30,674 --> 01:26:35,137
That's the way you are

1204
01:26:35,216 --> 01:26:39,512
I was blinded

1205
01:26:39,592 --> 01:26:44,138
By your passionate kisses

1206
01:26:44,216 --> 01:26:48,387
You lied coldly

1207
01:26:48,425 --> 01:26:52,763
But the curtain
finally came down

1208
01:26:54,425 --> 01:26:57,261
Playacting

1209
01:26:57,342 --> 01:27:01,721
That's what you do best

1210
01:27:01,759 --> 01:27:06,138
A finely rehearsed lie

1211
01:27:06,217 --> 01:27:10,513
A well-turned mockery

1212
01:27:10,593 --> 01:27:15,056
You outdid yourself

1213
01:27:15,092 --> 01:27:18,387
Destroying my heart

1214
01:27:19,426 --> 01:27:23,889
And now that your tears are for real

1215
01:27:23,968 --> 01:27:28,473
I only remember your lies

1216
01:27:28,552 --> 01:27:32,931
Forgive me
if I don't believe you

1217
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:37,973
But I think
you're putting on a show

1218
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:41,221
Don't forget that after all

1219
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:43,471
I'm supposed to be in the wrong

1220
01:27:47,844 --> 01:27:51,222
Playacting

1221
01:27:51,261 --> 01:27:55,724
That's what you do best

1222
01:27:55,802 --> 01:27:59,014
A finely rehearsed lie

1223
01:28:00,094 --> 01:28:04,182
A well-turned mockery

1224
01:28:04,261 --> 01:28:08,724
You outdid yourself

1225
01:28:08,762 --> 01:28:12,891
Destroying my heart
