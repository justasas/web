1
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:39,449
After all... I'm stupid.

2
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:43,699
After all, yes, I must. I must!

3
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,366
- Michel! Take me with you!
- What time is it?

4
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,908
- 10:50.
- No.

5
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,741
I'm on my way, hey-hey!

6
00:02:19,284 --> 00:02:24,574
If he thinks he's gonna pass me
in that crappy thing!

7
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,908
I pick up the cash,

8
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:40,241
I ask Patricia, yes or no, and then...

9
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:55,699
The countryside's nice.

10
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:06,908
I really like France.

11
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,908
If you don't like the sea,

12
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:18,283
if you don't like the mountains,

13
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:24,533
if you don't like the city,
then get stuffed!

14
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,741
Little girls trying to hitch a ride!

15
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,449
I'll charge a kiss per kilometer.

16
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:42,866
The short one's not bad.
Nice thighs.

17
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,908
But the other one...

18
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,199
Shit, they're too ugly.

19
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:15,324
The sun is beautiful.

20
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:26,158
Women are such cowards
behind the wheel. Overtake him!

21
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,616
Oh, there's roadwork’s.

22
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,116
Never use the brakes.

23
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,658
As old Bugatti said:
"Cars are made to run, not to stop. "

24
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,824
Shit! Cops!

25
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:05,699
The wire's come off!

26
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:10,116
This could get me nabbed!

27
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,491
Don't move, or I'll waste you.

28
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:25,408
- Miss Franchini's room?
- She isn't here. She's out.

29
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:37,616
Girls never have any cash!

30
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,491
Espresso.

31
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:45,699
- How much is ham and eggs?
- 1.80.

32
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,658
- Right. I'll have some.
- OK.

33
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:55,324
Just going for a paper.

34
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:20,241
- Oh, wow, Michel!
- Can I come in?

35
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:23,741
- How are you, sweetheart?
- No jacket?

36
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:26,533
I left it in my Alfa Romeo.

37
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:33,449
- Want breakfast at the Royal?
- I must be at the TV station by 9:10.

38
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:41,908
It's torn. Listen to this.

39
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:55,033
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing, I've been travelling.

40
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:57,866
What's new around here?

41
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:03,033
- You don't go out?
- To the discotheque sometimes.

42
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:07,324
- Still making films?
- No. You need to sleep around.

43
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,199
Do you recollect Enrico?

44
00:08:09,284 --> 00:08:14,033
"Remember" or "recall",
not "recollect".

45
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:18,199
I work with him at the station.
I'm a script-girl.

46
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:23,658
When I was broke in December,
I was assistant on a film at Cinecittà!

47
00:08:23,742 --> 00:08:25,408
You?

48
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:30,366
Ever been a gigolo?
I was just asking.

49
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:34,533
I wouldn't mind.

50
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:39,866
Call me back in a few minutes.

51
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,824
Is Gaby back from Spain?

52
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:47,991
He's bought the Pergola.

53
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:51,908
Great. It was stupid
to paint it all black.

54
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:56,908
- What's it say there?
- "Why?"

55
00:08:57,075 --> 00:09:01,408
Never finished it.
I smoke Luckies now.

56
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:06,699
- Can you lend me 5000 francs till noon?
- I might have known.

57
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:11,824
- You're a creep, Michel.
- I'll pay you back.

58
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:15,408
I don't have that much.

59
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:19,658
- Here's 500 if you want.
- No, keep it.

60
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:47,949
- So, no breakfast at the Royal?
- I'm really late.

61
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,616
Okay, then.

62
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,283
- Is Mr Tolmachov here?
- He's here, but he's not here.

63
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:03,616
- Seen Patricia?
- Yes, over there.

64
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,033
Come with me to Rome?

65
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,366
It's crazy, I wanted to see
if I'd be glad to see you again.

66
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,658
Have you been in Monte Carlo?

67
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:28,158
No, Marseilles. I was in Monte Carlo
before that to see a guy.

68
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:32,866
- I called on Monday, from Marseilles.
- I was out of town.

69
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:39,241
- I'll take one.
- That's kind.

70
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:49,866
- You said you hated Paris.
- No, I said I've got enemies here.

71
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,158
- So you're in danger?
- Yes, I am. Will you come to Rome?

72
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:57,283
To do what?

73
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:02,658
- No, I've things to do here.
- You going up or down the Champs?

74
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:06,908
- What's the "Champs"?
- The Champs Elysées.

75
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:13,449
I'm going to Avenue George V.
Go on, walk with me.

76
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:16,366
Just to the corner.

77
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,699
Here, no horoscope! It's the future.
I want to know the future.

78
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:35,699
- Don't you?
- Sure.

79
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:44,658
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, just looking at you.

80
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,949
- You angry I left without a goodbye?
- No, I was furious because I was sad.

81
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,991
It's nice to wake up next to a girl.

82
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:01,824
Are you staying in town?

83
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:04,699
I have to see a man who owes me money.

84
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:10,574
- Then I have to see you.
- You don't have to.

85
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:14,574
- There are prettier girls than me.
- No.

86
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:19,324
I slept with two girls since you.
It was a washout.

87
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:27,116
- What's "washout"?
- They were pretty, but it was no fun.

88
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,949
So will you come to Rome?
I'm fed up with France.

89
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:37,283
I have to enroll at the Sorbonne
so my parents will send money.

90
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:41,283
- We only had 3 nights together!
- No, 5.

91
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:46,616
- Why don't you wear a bra?
- Don't be rude!

92
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:52,741
- What time is it? See you later?
- Not later. Tonight. Okay?

93
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:56,574
- Yes. Where?
- Round here.

94
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:17,824
LIVE DANGEROUSLY UNTIL THE END!

95
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:30,741
- Sir? You've nothing against youth?
- I have. I like old people.

96
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,033
POLICEMAN'S KILLER IDENTIFIED

97
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:05,283
- Is Mr Tolmachov here?
- At the airline desk.

98
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,574
Hi, amigo.

99
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:30,408
- You came by at ten?
- Yeah, for my money.

100
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,866
I got bored down south.
I came up to see a girl.

101
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:53,074
- I'm rusting away here.
- Better rusted than busted.

102
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,241
Over here.

103
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:06,241
Do you have the envelope I gave you?

104
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:17,658
- Idiot! Why did he cross it?
- Just sign it over to someone else.

105
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:21,449
Not to me.
I blew my last penny on the races.

106
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:27,116
- And your pal, Bob Montagné?
- He's in prison.

107
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,033
- There's Berruti, but I don't trust him.
- I thought he was your pal.

108
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:36,783
- Is he back?
- Yes, I saw him last night.

109
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,824
- What was his number again?
- Elysée 99-84.

110
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:51,658
- Can I call from here?
- Go ahead.

111
00:15:54,617 --> 00:15:59,366
- Who's the girl you came for?
- A New Yorker.

112
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,866
She's amusing. I like her.

113
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:06,824
Elysée 99-84?

114
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:10,491
I'd like to speak to Antonio.

115
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:14,741
I see. No, I'll call back.

116
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:19,241
He's out. I'll ask around.

117
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:23,074
- Bye, sonny.
- Ciao, amigo.

118
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,908
- Inter-Americana Agency?
- Yes, that's us.

119
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:38,074
- Do customers have mail sent here?
- Yes.

120
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,366
- Know a certain Michel Poiccard?
- No.

121
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,491
Also goes by the name Laszlo Kovacs?

122
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:49,741
Ask that gentleman.
He'll help you.

123
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:06,116
If it isn't Tolmachov!

124
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:09,324
Hello, Inspector.

125
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:14,074
- In the travel business now?
- As you can see.

126
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:21,449
Remember how you grassed
on your friend Bob?

127
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:26,699
- What of it?
- Well, you're going to do it again.

128
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:32,741
Michel Poiccard, 1 metre 79,
brown hair, former Air France steward.

129
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:37,574
- He has his mail sent here.
- Yes, I know him.

130
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:41,366
- He been around lately?
- No.

131
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,616
Miss!

132
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,074
Nobody been to see
Mr Tolmachov recently?

133
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:58,491
- Just 5 minutes ago, quite a tall man.
- Bloody hell!

134
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,908
Accessory to murder. Think about it!

135
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,949
THE HARDER THEY FALL

136
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,949
Bogey...

137
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,699
I saw a man die.
An accident.

138
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:26,408
- Take me out to dinner?
- Evidently.

139
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:31,283
Let me make another call first.
Wait for me?

140
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:37,866
- Call from the restaurant.
- No. I'll just be a second.

141
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,741
The French always say one second
when they mean 5 minutes.

142
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,741
- Where we going?
- Anywhere. To Saint Michel.

143
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:43,866
Sleep with me tonight?

144
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,366
- Don't you like it with me?
- Sure, I do.

145
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,741
I just read something in the paper.
About a bus conductor.

146
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:57,408
He stole 5 million to seduce a girl.
Impersonated a rich impresario.

147
00:20:57,492 --> 00:21:01,574
He took her down to the Riviera.
They blew the lot in 3 days.

148
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,533
The guy didn't chicken out.
He told her:

149
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:09,908
"It's stolen money, I'm a bad guy,
but I like you. "

150
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,158
It's great she stuck by him.
She said: "I like you, too. "

151
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:21,324
They came back to Paris,
and were caught burgling villas.

152
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:24,991
She was the look-out.

153
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,574
- Excuse me, got a light?
- Go buy yourself some matches!

154
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:37,116
- I forgot! I have an appointment.
- Who with?

155
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,783
A journalist on the Champs Elysees.
It's a press conference.

156
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:48,783
- Where? Now?
- You can really get on my nerves.

157
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:53,199
- So you're leaving me?
- But I'll see you tomorrow.

158
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,658
Not tomorrow, tonight, Patricia.

159
00:21:55,742 --> 00:22:00,533
- I told you I can't.
- Why are you so cruel?

160
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:07,824
- Any taxis around?
- My car's near the Opera. Want a lift?

161
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:13,491
- What happened to the Ford?
- It's in the garage.

162
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:18,241
- Let me stay with you.
- I've got a headache anyway.

163
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:23,616
- We won't make love.
- That's not it, Michel!

164
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:32,908
- Why are you so sad?
- Because I am.

165
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:35,116
That's silly.

166
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:39,324
Why are you sad?

167
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:44,283
- Should I use "vous" or "tu"?
- Either. But I can't do without you.

168
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:48,366
- Yes, you can.
- Maybe. But I don't want to.

169
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,699
Look at that great Talbot. A 2.5 litre.

170
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:59,783
- You're a kid...
- What?

171
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:05,783
- Oh, I don't know.
- I forbid you to meet this guy.

172
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,116
Alas, alas, alas!

173
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:18,283
I love a girl who has a nice neck,
nice breasts,

174
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:24,658
a nice voice, nice wrists,
a nice forehead, nice knees.

175
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:32,491
But she's such a coward!

176
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:39,783
- It's there. Stop.
- I'll park.

177
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,908
Get lost then!

178
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:49,158
I never want to see you again.
Get lost!

179
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:54,324
Get lost, you creep!

180
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,449
- I'd be sad if that happened to you.
- We'll see.

181
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:49,699
What's wrong?

182
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:53,741
If I could dig a hole
and hide in it, I would.

183
00:24:53,825 --> 00:25:00,199
You should be like an elephant.
When they're sad, they vanish.

184
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:15,491
Let me tell you a story.
It'll take your mind off things.

185
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:19,699
I've known a girl 2 years.
And now, I suddenly think:

186
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,699
I'll ask her to sleep with me.
It had never occurred to me.

187
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:29,741
We met for lunch. I wanted to say:
"We're friends, let's sleep together. "

188
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:34,741
I don't know why,
but it completely slipped my mind!

189
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,866
Later I sent her a telegram,

190
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,574
saying I'd forgotten to say
we should sleep together.

191
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,783
3 hours later I get
a message back, saying:

192
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:50,533
"What an amazing coincidence!

193
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:54,866
I was going to suggest the same thing!"

194
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,783
- Is this the late edition?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:34,283
- My key isn't here?
- You must've left it in the door.

196
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,616
Oh, no!

197
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:48,783
- What are you doing here?
- The Claridge was fully booked.

198
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:52,908
So I came here.
I took the key downstairs.

199
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:59,074
- There are other hotels.
- I always stay at the Claridge.

200
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,908
You're crazy!

201
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:05,241
- Don't sulk!
- I can never be alone...

202
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:07,991
It doesn't suit you.

203
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:12,783
- What's "sulk"?
- This.

204
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:22,783
It suits me fine.

205
00:29:22,867 --> 00:29:25,116
You're even crazier than me.

206
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,908
What a pain. I always fall for girls
who aren't for me.

207
00:29:31,992 --> 00:29:36,658
Did you notice
I followed you last night?

208
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:44,199
- What's wrong?
- Leave me alone. I'm thinking.

209
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,449
What about?

210
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:51,283
The thing is, I don't even know.

211
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:55,241
- Well, I do.
- No, nobody does.

212
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:58,908
You're thinking about last night.

213
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:04,158
Last night I was furious,
but now I couldn't care less.

214
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:07,908
I'm not thinking about anything.

215
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:15,866
I'd like to think about something,
but I can't seem to.

216
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:20,074
Well, I'm tired, very tired,

217
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,408
and I'm going back to sleep.

218
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:33,324
- Why are you looking at me?
- Because I am.

219
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:36,991
- You should've stayed last night.
- I couldn't.

220
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:41,324
You should've told the chap
you couldn't see him.

221
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:46,908
I had to. He's getting me articles
to write. It's really important for me.

222
00:30:46,992 --> 00:30:50,366
What's important
is going to Rome with me.

223
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,783
Maybe, I don't know.

224
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:57,491
- Did you sleep with him?
- No.

225
00:30:57,575 --> 00:31:02,116
- I bet you did.
- No. He's really sweet.

226
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,366
He said one day we'd sleep together,
but not now.

227
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,658
- But he doesn't even know me.
- Not you. Him and me.

228
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:18,158
- We had a drink in Montparnasse.
- I was there, too. At what time?

229
00:31:18,242 --> 00:31:22,366
I don't know. We didn't stay long.

230
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,283
Why did you come here, Michel?

231
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:33,074
- I want to sleep with you again.
- That's hardly a reason.

232
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,199
- Sure it is. It means I love you.
- But I don't know yet if I love you.

233
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:44,408
- When will you know?
- Soon.

234
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:51,199
- In a month, in a year?
- Soon means soon.

235
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,116
A woman never wants to do
in eight seconds

236
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,908
what she'll want to do
eight days later.

237
00:31:57,992 --> 00:32:01,741
Eight seconds or eight days,
it's all the same.

238
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:07,283
- Why not eight centuries?
- No, eight days is good.

239
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:11,491
A woman's all half-measures.

240
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:14,324
It gets me down.

241
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,824
Why won't you sleep with me again?

242
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:25,283
Because I'm trying to find out
what it is that I like about you.

243
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:31,283
- I want us to be like Romeo and Juliet.
- Just like a girl!

244
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:37,074
You said last night you couldn't
live without me, but you can.

245
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,158
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet,
but you can.

246
00:32:42,242 --> 00:32:45,991
No, I can't live without you.

247
00:32:46,075 --> 00:32:49,991
Just like a man!

248
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:53,033
Give me a smile.

249
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:56,699
Right. I'll count to 8.

250
00:32:56,784 --> 00:33:01,408
If by 8 you haven't smiled,
I'll strangle you.

251
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:04,574
Two.

252
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:06,324
Three.

253
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,616
Four, five, six.

254
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,491
Seven.

255
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:12,783
Seven and a half.

256
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,699
Seven and three quarters.

257
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:20,449
You're such a coward
I bet you're gonna smile.

258
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:27,449
Enough games for today.

259
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:34,199
- Too bad you're a coward.
- Why do you say that?

260
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:37,991
- You get on my nerves.
- And you get on mine.

261
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:41,283
- I'm not a coward.
- How do you know I'm scared?

262
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:45,658
If a girl says she's not scared,
then can't even light her cigarette,

263
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:51,949
it means she's scared of something.
I don't know of what, but she's scared.

264
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:57,366
- Have one.
- None of those Chesterfields.

265
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,241
Hand me my jacket.

266
00:34:00,325 --> 00:34:04,074
- In this one?
- Give it here!

267
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,241
- This is your passport?
- My brother's. Mine's in the car.

268
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:15,116
- But it says Kovacs here.
- He's not my real brother.

269
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,866
My mum was divorced
by the time he was born.

270
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,783
See? I'm not scared.

271
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:35,574
- I never said you were.
- You bet, pet.

272
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:41,866
But you wish you had said it.
And now you're angry.

273
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:45,574
I'm not talking to you anymore.

274
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:56,324
Do you ever think about death?
I do, all the time.

275
00:34:58,617 --> 00:35:02,783
- What?
- Say something nice.

276
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,199
- Like what?
- I don't know.

277
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:09,408
Then neither do I.

278
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,908
- I like your ashtray.
- It's Swiss.

279
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:19,949
My granddad had a Rolls-Royce.
Great car!

280
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,116
Never had to raise the bonnet
in 15 years!

281
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:29,074
Seen my new poster?

282
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:34,741
Come here!
Come here, for Christ's sake!

283
00:35:34,825 --> 00:35:38,908
It won't do here. Where can I put it?

284
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:44,033
Why did you slap me
when I looked at your legs?

285
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:46,658
It wasn't my legs.

286
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:50,783
It's exactly the same thing.

287
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:55,741
The French always say things
are the same when they're not at all.

288
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,574
- I've thought of something nice.
- What?

289
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,991
I want to sleep with you again
because you're beautiful.

290
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:08,491
I'm not.

291
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:13,366
- Then because you're ugly.
- Is it the same?

292
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,783
Yeah, baby, it's the same.

293
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:24,824
- You're a liar, Michel.
- No, lying's stupid.

294
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:28,366
It's like at poker...
It's better to tell the truth.

295
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:33,866
The others think you're bluffing,
and that's how you win.

296
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,533
What is it?

297
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:43,949
I'll stare at you
until you stop staring at me.

298
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:15,908
I'm going to put my poster
in the bathroom.

299
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:19,616
- Can I phone?
- Yes.

300
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:26,491
- It's not bad here.
- Just fine.

301
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:37,324
- Do you like this poster?
- It's not bad.

302
00:37:38,534 --> 00:37:43,866
- Renoir's a really great painter.
- I said, not bad!

303
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,324
Think she's prettier than me?

304
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:55,783
When you're scared or surprised,
or both at once...

305
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:59,199
.. there's a funny glint in your eyes.

306
00:37:59,284 --> 00:38:03,949
I want to sleep with you again,
because of that glint.

307
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:10,949
Mind if I piss in the sink?

308
00:38:11,784 --> 00:38:16,116
- Guess what I'm going to say.
- No idea.

309
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,283
I'm pregnant, Michel.

310
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:25,158
You heard me.

311
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:29,324
- Whose is it? Mine?
- I think so.

312
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:33,283
- Seen a doctor?
- Yesterday.

313
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:37,324
I have to go back Thursday for tests.

314
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:40,991
You should've been more careful!

315
00:38:54,450 --> 00:39:00,324
Get me Elysée 99-84.
99-84.

316
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:07,908
Is Antonio there?

317
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:14,116
You don't know if he's coming back?
I'll call back.

318
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,824
Michel Poiccard.

319
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,991
Elysée 25-32.

320
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:33,449
I'm calling
the man who owes me money.

321
00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:37,908
Mr Tolmachov, please.

322
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,033
Hey, sonny.

323
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:49,408
I can't find Berruti.

324
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:53,699
I wandered
around Montparnasse all night.

325
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:57,991
The police?

326
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:03,616
Thanks. Ciao, sonny.

327
00:40:05,242 --> 00:40:06,699
Shit!

328
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:09,866
- What?
- I slipped.

329
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,283
Heard the one
about the condemned man?

330
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:19,491
As he's climbing the scaffold,
he slips and says, "that figures!"

331
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:31,408
- You look like a Martian up close.
- Because my head's in the clouds.

332
00:40:31,492 --> 00:40:35,783
- Some idea, having a kid!
- But it's not sure.

333
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,949
I wanted to see what you'd say.

334
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:41,366
- Take your clothes off.
- What's the point?

335
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,824
You Americans are so stupid.

336
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:48,824
You adore La Fayette
and Maurice Chevalier.

337
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:54,408
And they're the stupidest Frenchmen!
I'm making another call.

338
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:59,158
Belle Epine 35-26.

339
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:01,824
Patricia, come here!

340
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,241
Hello, Mr Mansard?

341
00:41:07,325 --> 00:41:13,449
Will he be in this afternoon?
Tell him I'll come by.

342
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:16,783
I'm a friend of Tony's. From Marseilles.

343
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:20,366
Laszlo Kovacs. I've got an American.

344
00:41:22,742 --> 00:41:26,366
- An American?
- Laszlo Kovacs.

345
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:32,741
Not you. An American car.

346
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:42,158
I can't find the man
who owes me money. What a pain!

347
00:41:42,242 --> 00:41:47,366
- Do you prefer records or the radio?
- Quiet, I'm thinking!

348
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:09,074
- I know them all so well.
- How old are you?

349
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:15,324
- I'll put the radio on. I'm 20.
- You don't look it.

350
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:19,949
- Why don't you like music?
- It depends. I do.

351
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:23,199
Come on, Patricia, come to Italy.

352
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:30,949
What's the point of studying
at the Sorbonne?

353
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:34,199
You never took any exams.

354
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:38,408
Sure, the baccalaureate.
But I packed it in.

355
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:43,408
- What's "packed it in"?
- I did other things.

356
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:46,574
- I sold cars.
- Here?

357
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:49,491
No.

358
00:42:49,575 --> 00:42:55,491
In New York,
did you sleep with a lot of men?

359
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:59,449
Not so many.

360
00:42:59,534 --> 00:43:02,158
How many?

361
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:06,408
- How about you?
- Me?

362
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,741
Not so many either.

363
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:18,116
You know where I'd like to live?
Mexico. I hear it's really lovely.

364
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,699
When I was a kid my dad would say:
We'll go next Saturday.

365
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:25,491
But he'd always forget.

366
00:43:27,534 --> 00:43:32,408
No, Mexico doesn't grab me.
I bet it's not all that great.

367
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:38,158
People are such liars.
It's like Stockholm. Everyone says...

368
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:43,283
"Swedish girls are terrific.
I had 3 a day. Go there. "

369
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,908
I went there. It's not true.

370
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:50,283
Swedish girls don't act
the way they do here.

371
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:53,616
Most of them are dogs
like Parisian girls.

372
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,408
No, Swedish girls are very pretty.

373
00:43:57,492 --> 00:44:00,449
It's a myth.

374
00:44:00,534 --> 00:44:06,199
One or two maybe, like in Paris
or London, but not all of them.

375
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:10,241
The cities where the girls are pretty,

376
00:44:10,325 --> 00:44:14,533
not gorgeous, but like you, charming,

377
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:20,949
girls who rate 15 out of 20,
because they have something...

378
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:28,783
Aren't Rome or Paris or Rio
but Lausanne and Geneva.

379
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,033
- Now you tell me something nice.
- I don't know what, either.

380
00:44:40,784 --> 00:44:44,533
Would you let another man caress you?

381
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:51,616
You know, you said I'm scared.

382
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:57,074
It's true, I'm scared.
Because I want you to love me.

383
00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:02,616
But at the same time,
I want you to stop loving me.

384
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,449
I'm very independent, you know.

385
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:12,199
I love you.
But not the way you think.

386
00:45:12,284 --> 00:45:15,533
- How then?
- Not the way you think.

387
00:45:15,617 --> 00:45:19,783
But you don't know what I think.
You don't know.

388
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:23,283
- Yes, I do.
- No, it's impossible.

389
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:29,283
I want to know
what's behind your face.

390
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:34,491
I've looked at it for 10 minutes,
and I still know nothing.

391
00:45:34,575 --> 00:45:38,616
I'm not sad. I'm scared.

392
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,908
Sweet, gentle Patricia.

393
00:45:40,992 --> 00:45:45,908
OK, then, cruel, stupid,
heartless, pathetic...

394
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:49,199
- .. cowardly, despicable.
- Yes.

395
00:45:49,284 --> 00:45:55,658
You don't even how to apply
your lipstick. Now you're hideous.

396
00:45:55,742 --> 00:46:00,783
Say what you like, I don't care.
I'll put all this in my book.

397
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:03,908
- What book?
- I'm writing a novel.

398
00:46:04,034 --> 00:46:08,283
- You?
- Why not me? What are you doing?

399
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:11,699
- Taking off your top.
- Not now.

400
00:46:11,784 --> 00:46:15,824
You're a bloody pain! What is all this?

401
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:18,866
You know William Faulkner?

402
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:24,533
- Who's he? Someone you slept with?
- No way, Jose!

403
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:28,158
To hell with him, then!
Take off your top.

404
00:46:28,242 --> 00:46:31,949
He's one of my favourites.
Have you read Wild Palms?

405
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:38,949
- Take off your top, I said.
- The last sentence is beautiful.

406
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:49,324
"Between grief and nothing,
I will take grief. "

407
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:53,908
- Which would you choose?
- Let me see your toes.

408
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:57,824
Toes are important in a woman.
Don't laugh.

409
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:02,449
- Which would you choose?
- Grief's stupid.

410
00:47:02,534 --> 00:47:04,324
I'd choose nothing.

411
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:09,241
It's not better,
but grief's a compromise.

412
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:14,033
I want all or nothing.
And now I know.

413
00:47:14,117 --> 00:47:17,866
Now I do.
Why are you shutting your eyes?

414
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,949
I'm shutting my eyes tight
so everything goes black.

415
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:25,866
But I can't do it.
It's never entirely black.

416
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:32,366
Your smile, seen in profile,
it's the nicest thing about you.

417
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:36,074
- That's you.
- That's me!

418
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:50,533
We look each other in the eyes,
and it means nothing.

419
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,033
Patricia Franchini.

420
00:47:55,117 --> 00:47:59,783
I hate that name.
I'd like to be called Ingrid.

421
00:48:01,284 --> 00:48:05,533
Kneel for me.

422
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:09,574
What's wrong?

423
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:14,991
- I'm looking at you.
- The French are stupid, too.

424
00:48:22,284 --> 00:48:26,491
- I want you to stay with me.
- OK.

425
00:48:26,575 --> 00:48:32,616
We interrupt our programming
in order to synchronize our networks.

426
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:42,991
Funny, I can see
my reflection in your eyes.

427
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:46,324
A real Franco-American reconciliation.

428
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:49,033
We're hiding like happy elephants.

429
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:53,783
- Women's hips move me somehow.
- It's hot under here.

430
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:11,908
If it was another man caressing you,
would you mind?

431
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:15,741
Our musical program is about to start.

432
00:49:36,992 --> 00:49:39,074
There!

433
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:55,116
You know Dylan Thomas'
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog?

434
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:01,783
Sunday morning is most satisfying

435
00:50:01,867 --> 00:50:05,949
to have a really long lie-in.

436
00:50:06,034 --> 00:50:08,949
I'm getting dressed.

437
00:50:09,034 --> 00:50:12,241
- What time is it?
- Noon.

438
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:14,533
Was it good?

439
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:21,074
- Let's stay in bed.
- Nope, I've got to buy a dress.

440
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,199
- Have you got your car?
- Yeah.

441
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:30,074
Good morning, Michel.

442
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:40,991
Elysée 99-84.

443
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:48,074
Hello.

444
00:50:49,325 --> 00:50:51,699
Good morning.

445
00:50:51,784 --> 00:50:55,241
Has Antonio been back?

446
00:50:55,325 --> 00:50:59,491
Oh, no. This is unbelievable!

447
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:04,533
You don't know where he is?

448
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:09,616
No, never mind.
Michel Poiccard again.

449
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,324
Want me to wear a bra?

450
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:26,116
Which do you like best:
my eyes, my mouth or my shoulders?

451
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,324
If you had to choose.

452
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:39,991
- There was no press conference.
- No, it's at Orly in a little while.

453
00:51:40,075 --> 00:51:44,866
I'm not much of a looker,
but I'm quite a boxer!

454
00:51:48,784 --> 00:51:51,699
Going to your press conference?

455
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:55,866
- I have to drop by the office first.
- I'll come with you.

456
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:58,324
Eisenhower, with General de Gaulle,

457
00:51:58,409 --> 00:52:02,741
will lay a wreath
on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

458
00:52:02,825 --> 00:52:05,658
- Were you in the army?
- Yes.

459
00:52:05,742 --> 00:52:10,908
- What did you do?
- I did in the sentries.

460
00:52:10,992 --> 00:52:16,116
- "Did in"?
- I laid them out flat like this.

461
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:25,033
- I'm exhausted. I'm gonna die.
- You're crazy.

462
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:28,199
Yeah, totally barmy.

463
00:52:28,284 --> 00:52:32,866
- What's "barmy"?
- I am.

464
00:52:51,075 --> 00:52:55,116
- Your car's not here?
- Yes... No... Yes.

465
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,199
It's at the garage.

466
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:24,241
Great, a Ford!

467
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,199
- What floor?
- Fifth.

468
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:59,658
I got the wrong floor.

469
00:54:29,492 --> 00:54:33,658
- Scared of getting old? I am.
- You're stupid!

470
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:40,908
I told you,
the worst flaw is cowardice.

471
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:46,824
- Will you buy me a Dior dress?
- No way!

472
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,741
There are nicer dresses
at the supermarket.

473
00:54:49,825 --> 00:54:52,658
You make calls at Dior.

474
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:57,866
It's the only place
where you can phone for free.

475
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:01,866
France Soir! France Soir!

476
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,616
- Give me one!
- Here you go.

477
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,449
Thank you.

478
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:19,741
- I'll take one, please.
- Yes, sir.

479
00:55:26,950 --> 00:56:14,415
POLICE KILLER STILL AT LARGE

480
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:18,116
- How long will it last?
- Half an hour or so.

481
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,324
I'll go and see my guy, then.

482
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:44,658
Why did you call your novel "Candida"?

483
00:56:46,117 --> 00:56:49,658
I'm sure that the French
will give my book

484
00:56:49,742 --> 00:56:53,449
a cool reception
because of their prudishness.

485
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:56,116
Mr Parvulesco!

486
00:56:58,617 --> 00:57:03,574
Can one still believe
in love in our time?

487
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:07,533
Of course, especially in our time.

488
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,616
What about Rilke's saying:

489
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:15,908
"Modern life increasingly separates
men and women?"

490
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:21,241
Rilke was a great poet,
he was probably right.

491
00:57:21,325 --> 00:57:22,908
Move back a bit!

492
00:57:22,992 --> 00:57:26,866
Typical Pathé-Journal!

493
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:35,366
Do French and American women
differ in their romantic attitudes?

494
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:39,116
French women
are totally unlike Americans.

495
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,074
American women dominate men.
French women don't yet.

496
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:50,824
What's your greatest ambition?

497
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:55,283
Who are more moral:
unfaithful women or deserting males?

498
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:57,116
Unfaithful women.

499
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,949
Are women more sentimental than men?

500
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:05,783
Feelings are a luxury
few women can afford.

501
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:12,658
Do you think there is a difference
between eroticism and love?

502
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:17,491
No, not really.

503
00:58:17,575 --> 00:58:20,533
I don't think so, because...

504
00:58:20,617 --> 00:58:24,616
Eroticism is a form of love,
and vice versa.

505
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,574
Does the soul exist in modern society?

506
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:37,283
Do women have a role to play
in modern society?

507
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:43,533
If she's charming and wears
a striped dress and dark glasses.

508
00:58:43,617 --> 00:58:48,699
Casanova said that there's no woman
who can't be seduced with gratitude.

509
00:58:48,784 --> 00:58:51,449
Cocteau will answer that.

510
00:58:51,534 --> 00:58:57,449
How many men can a woman love
in a lifetime? Physically, I mean.

511
00:59:02,575 --> 00:59:04,949
More than that!

512
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:09,491
- Miss, you're in the shot.
- Two things matter in life.

513
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:14,616
For men, it's women,
and for women, money.

514
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,116
If you see a pretty girl
with a rich chap,

515
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,783
you know she's nice
and he's a bastard.

516
00:59:25,617 --> 00:59:28,908
- Do you like Brahms?
- Like everyone, no.

517
00:59:28,992 --> 00:59:31,699
- And Chopin?
- A creep!

518
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:34,616
What's your greatest ambition?

519
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:42,824
To become immortal and then die.

520
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:28,283
Are you Claudius Mansard?

521
01:00:28,367 --> 01:00:31,116
Yes, Mr Kovacs.

522
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,949
I called this morning.
I was told you'd be here.

523
01:00:36,034 --> 01:00:39,866
- Tony sent me.
- Yes, Mr Kovacs.

524
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:44,741
- Didn't we meet in Nice?
- No, Mr Kovacs.

525
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:49,866
- Did they call?
- They said it'd be an Oldsmobile.

526
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,533
It fell through at the last minute.

527
01:00:52,617 --> 01:00:56,533
- And so?
- So, it's this.

528
01:01:08,784 --> 01:01:11,908
- 800,000.
- OK.

529
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:19,533
- I'll have the money next week.
- You bastard!

530
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:23,824
And you, Mr Kovacs?
Who are you?

531
01:01:25,784 --> 01:01:30,574
- So what?
- You don't get the money now.

532
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:34,116
Tough. Is it 3 o'clock yet?

533
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,324
Can I use the phone?

534
01:01:53,034 --> 01:01:57,824
- Is Antonio there?
- He just left.

535
01:01:57,909 --> 01:02:02,366
He said to meet him at the Escale at 4.

536
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:04,658
OK, thanks.

537
01:02:07,867 --> 01:02:10,949
Don't bother. I carry my cash on me.

538
01:02:11,034 --> 01:02:15,783
- Lend me 10,000.
- No.

539
01:02:15,867 --> 01:02:18,324
5000?

540
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:20,991
2500?

541
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:29,116
She's not running?

542
01:02:30,617 --> 01:02:33,741
Hey, you!

543
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:38,408
You remove the distributor cap?

544
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:43,658
- You owe me a phone call!
- For a taxi!

545
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:50,074
Step on it! Never mind
the pedestrians! Just hurry!

546
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:52,574
Step on it!

547
01:02:53,825 --> 01:03:00,366
The Thunderbird's left wing torn off!
Me, not a scratch!

548
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:07,074
That's where I was born.
Look at the eyesore they built opposite!

549
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:11,574
Houses like that get me down.
They ruin the whole block.

550
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:15,866
I have a feeling for beauty, Beauty.

551
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:22,241
Go through Châtelet!
If we're late it's your fault.

552
01:03:22,325 --> 01:03:25,866
Overtake that Peugeot!

553
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:31,491
Don't brake for a 4CV!
You're being overtaken by a scooter!

554
01:03:31,575 --> 01:03:34,491
Take the next left!

555
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:38,158
- Wait. I'll be back.
- Yes, sir.

556
01:04:05,992 --> 01:04:08,199
He left 5 minutes ago.

557
01:04:08,284 --> 01:04:10,991
The friend who owes you money?

558
01:04:11,075 --> 01:04:15,283
Antonio Berruti, yeah,
and it's your fault.

559
01:04:15,367 --> 01:04:19,741
Now it's double or quits.
I'll tell you later.

560
01:04:19,867 --> 01:04:21,908
Overtake that 2CV.

561
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:26,574
- Where you going?
- To the New York Herald.

562
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:31,533
- Why bother writing?
- To have money and not rely on men.

563
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:35,491
Paris girls look like tarts
in those short dresses.

564
01:04:35,575 --> 01:04:42,116
Makes me want to run up behind them
and do like this.

565
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:56,033
- We'll be right back.
- Not paying the fare?

566
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:06,824
- Where are we going?
- To the Champs Elysees, on foot.

567
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:11,074
I hate taxi-drivers who are afraid
their car will get scratched.

568
01:05:11,159 --> 01:05:15,908
The Gestapo put up a wall here
so nobody could escape them.

569
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:19,658
I've been thinking about that girl.

570
01:05:19,742 --> 01:05:25,783
The one with that chap on the Riviera.
You said you admired her.

571
01:05:25,867 --> 01:05:29,866
Yeah, an ordinary girl. That's rare.

572
01:05:32,409 --> 01:05:36,408
- Come with me to the paper?
- No, I've a call to make.

573
01:05:36,492 --> 01:05:41,574
I'm going to see my tailor.
I'll pick you up later.

574
01:06:00,617 --> 01:06:04,241
You're late. They're waiting.

575
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:35,158
- Miss Patricia Franchini?
- Over there.

576
01:06:53,617 --> 01:06:58,283
You speak French?
Do you know this man?

577
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:07,741
No.

578
01:07:15,784 --> 01:07:20,158
Careful, little girl,
don't mess with the Paris police.

579
01:07:20,242 --> 01:07:23,283
- Yes, it's Michel.
- Poiccard?

580
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:27,408
I didn't recognise him.
It's an old photo.

581
01:07:27,492 --> 01:07:32,991
You were seen with him this morning
just outside.

582
01:07:33,075 --> 01:07:39,574
He was driving
a Ford Thunderbird, 3382 GM 75.

583
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:44,116
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

584
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,074
Watch it,
watch what you say, little girl!

585
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,033
I've seen him five or six times.

586
01:07:51,117 --> 01:07:56,241
I found him nice. I don't know
where he lives or what he does.

587
01:07:56,325 --> 01:07:59,616
Known him long?

588
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:04,158
I met him 3 weeks ago in Nice.
I was on holiday.

589
01:08:04,242 --> 01:08:08,158
He came to Paris to see someone
who owes him money.

590
01:08:08,242 --> 01:08:12,283
- Who?
- I don't know. Some Italian.

591
01:08:14,534 --> 01:08:17,866
- Think you'll see him again?
- Maybe.

592
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:22,908
Sometimes he calls me
and asks me out. Like this morning.

593
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,824
- Got a work permit?
- Yes.

594
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:33,616
You don't want any passport problems?

595
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,866
So if you see him, here's my number.

596
01:08:39,867 --> 01:08:43,241
Danton 01-00.

597
01:11:29,784 --> 01:11:34,324
President Eisenhower
is waving his arms.

598
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:44,116
Was that what you meant
by double or quits?

599
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,949
- More or less.
- Let's go see a western.

600
01:11:48,034 --> 01:11:51,158
Yeah, better wait till dark.

601
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:08,158
Beware, Jessica. On the kiss's
beveled edge time is a void

602
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:12,449
Avoid, avoid memory's broken pledge.

603
01:12:14,867 --> 01:12:20,116
You're wrong. Your tale is noble
and tragic as the mask of a tyrant.

604
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:24,949
No drama so perilous or magnetic.
No detail can make our love pathetic.

605
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:35,991
Hi, cutie!

606
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:53,949
- What's it say?
- I'm reading it.

607
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:59,366
The cops are stupid to be after me.
I'm one of the few who like them.

608
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:03,199
Patricia, let me caress you.

609
01:13:04,825 --> 01:13:08,408
- Say something!
- Well!

610
01:13:08,492 --> 01:13:12,241
- So you're married.
- Show me.

611
01:13:14,784 --> 01:13:19,241
That was ages ago.
She was crazy. She dumped me.

612
01:13:19,325 --> 01:13:24,449
- Or I dumped her. I can't remember.
- I really like you, Michel.

613
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:27,574
What's it like, to ride in a stolen car?

614
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:30,324
- And killing a policeman?
- I was scared!

615
01:13:30,409 --> 01:13:37,324
- How did they know I knew you?
- Someone must've seen us together.

616
01:13:37,409 --> 01:13:41,533
That's very bad.
Grassing people up.

617
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:46,949
No, it's normal. Grasses grass,
burglars burgle,

618
01:13:47,034 --> 01:13:51,199
murderers murder, lovers love.

619
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:56,949
Look, isn't the Concorde gorgeous!

620
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:02,616
Yes, mysterious, with all the lights.

621
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,658
I was a fool to keep this car.
Gotta switch.

622
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:09,866
- What?
- Switch cars.

623
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:27,366
- Let's steal the Cadillac.
- Sure.

624
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:29,908
Cadillac Eldorado.

625
01:14:29,992 --> 01:14:34,658
You drive, I hide.
They leave the keys in the car here.

626
01:14:38,867 --> 01:14:42,783
- What do I tell the man?
- Say goodnight... in English.

627
01:14:42,867 --> 01:14:46,658
He won't say a thing.
The French are chickens.

628
01:14:46,742 --> 01:14:49,491
- "Chickens"?
- Scared stiff.

629
01:14:49,575 --> 01:14:53,741
- Are you scared?
- It's too late to be scared.

630
01:15:00,784 --> 01:15:02,366
Goodnight Madam.

631
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:09,574
ARREST IMMINENT

632
01:15:19,575 --> 01:15:22,449
I really must find Antonio.

633
01:15:22,534 --> 01:15:27,283
Once you look for someone,
you never find him.

634
01:15:30,284 --> 01:15:32,824
Who was that?

635
01:15:32,909 --> 01:15:36,283
- Step on it, poppet.
- What's "poppet"?

636
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:59,908
- Seen Antonio?
- I'll tell you if I can kiss her.

637
01:16:00,992 --> 01:16:03,824
It's not up to me,

638
01:16:03,909 --> 01:16:06,324
it's up to her.

639
01:16:09,409 --> 01:16:12,491
He's with Zumbart in Montparnasse.

640
01:16:14,659 --> 01:16:16,741
Carl!

641
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,783
- How's things?
- Antonio's not with you?

642
01:16:23,867 --> 01:16:26,449
There he is.

643
01:16:28,534 --> 01:16:31,366
- Who's that?
- Antonio?

644
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:35,991
Patricia Franchini, Carl Zumbart.

645
01:16:36,075 --> 01:16:40,783
Let's see those socks.
Silk socks with a tweed jacket!

646
01:16:40,867 --> 01:16:45,324
- I like silk.
- Not with tweed!

647
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:49,741
- Hi, amigo.
- Hi, sonny.

648
01:16:49,867 --> 01:16:56,616
- You wanted to see me?
- I'm in shit, deep shit.

649
01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,366
Shit. Got a minute?
It's that man.

650
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:05,449
- What do I say?
- Anything you want.

651
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:10,366
- What will they do?
- Take photos of her kissing the man.

652
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:13,574
Blackmail, probably.

653
01:17:31,867 --> 01:17:35,366
- Right.
- I'll be right back.

654
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:40,783
- Who's the chick?
- I'm in love with her.

655
01:18:00,867 --> 01:18:03,699
1.3 million, is OK.

656
01:18:03,784 --> 01:18:07,866
- What's your bank?
- The B.N.C.I.

657
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,741
- What shall we do?
- I don't know.

658
01:18:13,825 --> 01:18:19,908
- Where can I reach you tomorrow?
- The hotels are crawling with tourists.

659
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:26,116
- My friend in Montmartre has a big flat.
- Not Montmartre.

660
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,866
- Why not?
- Too many enemies in Montmartre.

661
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:36,074
- Try Zumbart's Swedish girl.
- Rue Campagne Première?

662
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:40,324
- Call me there tomorrow.
- Bye, amigo.

663
01:18:55,659 --> 01:19:02,158
- Antonio said we could stay the night.
- Sit down. I'll be right with you.

664
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,241
OK. Smile.

665
01:19:09,325 --> 01:19:12,074
Smile!

666
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:17,574
- You could pose. It pays good.
- You have to sleep around.

667
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:22,658
I was just thinking... I can't decide.

668
01:19:22,742 --> 01:19:24,616
Decide what?

669
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,866
I don't know.
Otherwise I wouldn't hesitate.

670
01:19:34,784 --> 01:19:38,491
- You dumped your journalist?
- Yes.

671
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:43,033
- Why did you say hello?
- To be sure I didn't love him anymore.

672
01:19:43,117 --> 01:19:45,949
You make life difficult.

673
01:19:46,034 --> 01:19:50,324
That's it.
Drop me on the Champs Elysees?

674
01:19:55,034 --> 01:19:57,116
Bye.

675
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:10,449
- What record is it?
- Mozart's clarinet concerto.

676
01:20:10,534 --> 01:20:14,158
- Do you mind?
- No, I like that one.

677
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:18,658
- I thought you didn't like music.
- This one's OK.

678
01:20:18,742 --> 01:20:25,449
My dad played clarinet.
He was brilliant on the clarinet.

679
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:29,658
Want to turn in? Sleeping's so sad.

680
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:35,366
- We're forced to apart.
- To be apart.

681
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:39,616
They say "sleep together",
but it's not true.

682
01:20:51,409 --> 01:20:54,533
What is it?

683
01:20:57,325 --> 01:20:59,908
Nothing.

684
01:21:02,075 --> 01:21:04,949
Patricia, come here.

685
01:21:14,034 --> 01:21:18,199
Go buy the newspaper
and a bottle of milk.

686
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:28,449
- What time is it?
- Five.

687
01:21:33,617 --> 01:21:35,783
Engaged all the time.

688
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:47,491
- Michel... Nothing.
- The newspaper!

689
01:21:47,575 --> 01:21:50,366
I'm looking at you.

690
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:57,408
It's your lucky day. Take a ticket.

691
01:21:57,492 --> 01:22:01,283
- A whisky.
- Don't have any.

692
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:08,366
Danton 01-00?

693
01:22:09,825 --> 01:22:13,033
Inspector Vital, please.

694
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:22,574
Hello? Patricia Franchini.

695
01:22:23,659 --> 01:22:28,408
I've just seen the man
you're looking for.

696
01:22:28,492 --> 01:22:33,408
He's at 11, rue Première Campagne.

697
01:22:33,492 --> 01:22:38,866
Yes. 11, rue Campagne Première.
Hello?

698
01:23:31,575 --> 01:23:34,324
- Thirsty?
- No.

699
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:38,074
Antonio's on his way. He just called.

700
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,824
We're on our way to Italy, baby!

701
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,116
- I can't go.
- Sure you can, I'm taking you.

702
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:52,741
Berruti's lending me his sports car.
An Amedeo Gordini model.

703
01:23:52,825 --> 01:23:56,158
Michel, I called the police.

704
01:23:56,242 --> 01:24:00,616
- I said you were here.
- Are you mad?

705
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,824
No, I'm fine.

706
01:24:05,075 --> 01:24:10,283
No, I'm not.
I don't want to go with you.

707
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:13,783
I knew it.

708
01:24:13,867 --> 01:24:19,033
I just talked about myself,
and you, yourself.

709
01:24:19,117 --> 01:24:23,033
You should've talked about me,
and me, about you.

710
01:24:23,117 --> 01:24:26,741
I don't want to be in love with you.

711
01:24:27,784 --> 01:24:31,658
That's why I called the police.

712
01:24:31,742 --> 01:24:37,199
I stayed with you
to see if I was in love with you.

713
01:24:37,284 --> 01:24:40,908
Or if I wasn't in love with you.

714
01:24:42,409 --> 01:24:48,658
And since I'm being cruel to you,
it proves I'm not in love with you.

715
01:24:48,742 --> 01:24:50,908
Say that again!

716
01:24:50,992 --> 01:24:57,991
And since I'm being cruel to you,
it proves I'm not in love with you.

717
01:24:59,617 --> 01:25:02,658
They say there's no happy love.

718
01:25:02,742 --> 01:25:07,741
If I loved you... It's too complicated!

719
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:12,574
On the contrary,
there's no unhappy love.

720
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:17,908
- I want people to leave me alone.
- I'm independent.

721
01:25:17,992 --> 01:25:22,241
- Maybe you love me.
- You think you are. You're not.

722
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:27,616
- That's why I gave you away.
- I'm better than you are.

723
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:32,324
Now you have no choice but to go.

724
01:25:32,409 --> 01:25:35,616
You're out of your mind!

725
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:39,491
That's a pathetic way to reason!

726
01:25:45,575 --> 01:25:49,658
You're like those women
who sleep with everyone,

727
01:25:49,742 --> 01:25:54,449
except the one man who loves them,

728
01:25:54,534 --> 01:25:58,699
saying it's because they sleep
with everyone.

729
01:26:00,284 --> 01:26:03,408
Why don't you go?

730
01:26:05,575 --> 01:26:10,033
I've slept with lots of boys.
Don't count on me.

731
01:26:11,284 --> 01:26:14,866
- Just go. Why wait?
- I'm staying.

732
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:18,991
I'm in bad shape.
Anyway I want to go to jail.

733
01:26:19,075 --> 01:26:23,241
- You're mad!
- Yes.

734
01:26:25,117 --> 01:26:31,116
Nobody will talk to me.
I can look at the walls.

735
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,199
Oh, shit! Berruti!

736
01:26:34,284 --> 01:26:37,408
Hey, amigo! I'll just park.

737
01:26:40,242 --> 01:26:44,824
Cops are coming.
The American girl grassed on me.

738
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:50,491
- Get in! You fool! Get in!
- No, I'm staying.

739
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:58,824
I've had enough. I'm tired.
I want to sleep.

740
01:26:58,909 --> 01:27:04,158
- You're crazy! Get in!
- Stuff the police. I'll save my neck.

741
01:27:04,242 --> 01:27:09,199
I shouldn't be thinking of her
but I can't help it.

742
01:27:09,284 --> 01:27:14,033
- Want my automatic?
- No.

743
01:27:14,117 --> 01:27:17,866
- Don't be stupid!
- Get out of here!

744
01:29:19,492 --> 01:29:22,616
I am a real creep.

745
01:29:34,617 --> 01:29:39,824
- What did he say?
- He said: "You're a real creep. "

746
01:29:44,284 --> 01:29:47,241
What's a "creep"?
