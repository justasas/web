SAMir Offers

1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,300
The film-maker does not intend Gustave Minda’s
 “ethics” to be a Morality

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,800
The characters and situations of this work, inspired by a novel…

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,000
…have no basis in reality

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,800
No conclusions should therefore be drawn…

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,000
…from the methods of investigation
 employed in the story

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,000
At birth, man is granted only one
right: the choice of his own death

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,000
But if this choice is governed by disgust with life…

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,700
…then his existence will have been purely ridiculous

9
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,700
Second Breath

10
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,600
It’s set for December 28th

11
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
If it comes off, you get your cut

12
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,900
And if it doesn’t come off?

13
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,000
It’s set for December 28th.
Forget your trip

14
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,500
I’ll be right back, as agreed

15
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,300
You might find yourself detained in Paris,
 and you’re indispensable here

16
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,100
It’s a risky job, and without you…

17
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Without me?  I’ll be back this time tomorrow

18
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,100
Blame the bastard Jacques the Notary

19
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,500
We can deal with him later.
I need you here, Jeannot

20
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,000
No one’s indispensable

21
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,300
-Did you do anything this evening?
-I went to the movies

22
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,700
-Any good?
Not bad

23
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
It’s a good thing the cashier’s coming back next week

24
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,600
What’s up?

25
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,800
Gu has escaped

26
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
Let’s go home

27
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,400
Alban – two cognacs

28
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,600
It’s extraordinary

29
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,300
Ten years ago I tried to help him…

30
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,000
…and he told me just to heave him to die in peace

31
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,300
I was afraid he might kill himself

32
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Now, at forty-six years of age…

33
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Gu has escaped

34
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,200
We must help him lie low

35
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,200
What happened?

36
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,800
Did you see anything?  Then keep
your mouth shut like the rest of us

37
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,300
Look out below

38
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
See you tomorrow

39
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,100
-Is it Madame?
No, Jacques.  Send everyone home

40
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,000
Watch out, they’re here!

41
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Everyone in the wagon.
Don’t touch that, for God’s sake!

42
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,700
Who did the shooting?  Her?

43
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,500
It wasn’t here.  She owns the place

44
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,400
We’ll get you later

45
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,100
I doubt if he’ll tell you much

46
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,300
Good evening, Manouche

47
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
Jacques Ribaldi, “Jacques the
Notary” because he once studied law

48
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,200
He never had a chance to use it

49
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,300
Were you in a better position?

50
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,500
You know I don’t use guns any more

51
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,400
And I know all your enemies are dead

52
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,800
That’s a bit much

53
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,700
Try not to faint.  Anyway, as long as
 Manouche is O.K., that’s all you care

54
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,400
Gather around

55
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,300
I won’t enquire about customers:
I presume there weren’t any tonight

56
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,300
Gentlemen, the remnants of food on the tables…

57
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,500
…are not signs of a hurried departure

58
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,800
It happens all the time, leaving
courses of a meal unfinished

59
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,900
No doubt they heard that the
Queen of England was hitch-hiking outside

60
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,500
Furthermore, Alban here did not see a thing

61
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,000
He was crouched behind the bar, swatting flies

62
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,900
When he looked up, the bad guys –
and who knows what they wanted – had gone

63
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,300
He’s not an inkling whether it was one man
or a tribe of Tuaregs

64
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,000
Right, Alban?

65
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,500
That’s about it

66
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,400
Manouche, now.  Gossip says Jacques the
Notary had a soft spot for her

67
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,100
But what could that have to do with anything?

68
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,400
Manouche saw nothing:
she was concentrating on making up a bill

69
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,300
And here’s the second barman: Marcel
from St Etienne, if memory serves

70
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,700
A fierce man bursting in so distressed
Marcel, he can’t possibly describe him

71
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,800
He hid behind the bar, and only now he has ventured out

72
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,700
He didn’t see a thing.  Right, Marcel?

73
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,600
Take your time

74
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,500
It’s just as if you had been here

75
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,900
Note the honesty and the amenability
of the witness, gentlemen

76
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,100
Here we have the commissionaire,
an honorable man whose name escapes me

77
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,800
He saw customers come in, but
heard nothing because of the traffic

78
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Trains and the trucks are so noisy

79
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,300
He saw customers come out, but of course,
saw nothing unusual in that

80
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,800
They told him a man had died and
he’s still suffering from shock

81
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,700
Are you able to speak yet?

82
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,500
A real shock it was

83
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,400
I have no wish to torture you further.
Do sit down, don’t be so agitated

84
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,700
A village idiot could see that these
people saw nothing, gentlemen

85
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,900
As for the disappearing diners,
 they aren’t paid to reason why

86
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,700
We aren’t all gifted with imagination.  That’s it gentlemen

87
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Don’t bother

88
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Am I mistaken in thinking that
the kitchen staff have gone home, Alban?

89
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,400
There was nothing for them to do

90
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,700
It’s like a kindergarten

91
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,400
May I repeat the request of two years ago?

92
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,000
It’s up-to-date

93
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,900
The staff records;
they won’t provide very rich pickings

94
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,800
Have the corpse picked up

95
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,700
That’s strange; it looks as though they
fired towards the street as they left

96
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,800
Unless someone within was shooting at them

97
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,700
I hope you killed at least one of them, Alban.
We’ll know in a day or two

98
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,000
Only the corpse is to go; the
standard formula will cover the rest

99
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,000
You may be wanted for questioning:
don’t leave town without advising us

100
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,100
He had family in Paris?

101
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
No.  Not as far as I’m aware.
They’re in Corsica

102
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
His mother and two younger brothers

103
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Alone again, Manouche?
It’s a pity the vacancy costs so dear

104
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,700
It’s over

105
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,900
One comes to a dead end, then someone
new turns up and everything changes

106
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,500
Good night, Alban.  You can read this to her tonight

107
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,200
Former Public Enemy No. 1,
 Gu Minda, escapes from jail…

108
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,000
…after serving ten years of a fife sentence
for robbing “The Gold Train”

109
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,600
Jeannot’s still in a coma

110
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,700
-Haven’t you had a doctor?
Sure.  Jeannot’s calling for you

111
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,000
I’ll go to Paris with you

112
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,400
Jacques wanted me to go away with him for a while

113
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,800
Perhaps he did love me

114
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,700
Hold it!

115
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,900
Call Manouche

116
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,200
Don’t you find the artillery heavy?

117
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,800
What have you done to Alban?

118
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,900
Come to finish the job, have you?

119
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
That depends

120
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,600
After fifteen years, I know the score

121
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,300
Maybe you don’t

122
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,500
This business can stop…

123
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,500
…whenever you say

124
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,600
-How much?
We’re not greedy

125
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,300
50,000 francs each

126
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,600
Hands up!

127
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,100
Don’t say anything, Manouche.
You two, lie flat on the floor

128
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,100
Frisk them.  Who has the key to the handcuffs?

129
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,300
He’s out cold.  Tell him not to say my name

130
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Playing games, were we?

131
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,300
So you’re letting punks take you these days, are you?

132
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,400
Get up

133
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,800
Put your hands down.  It’s
easy hitting from behind, isn’t it?

134
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,200
Now we have a little chat.  What’s your name?

135
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,100
Henri… Henri Tourneur

136
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,700
Who sent you?

137
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,700
You shouldn’t make me ask you twice

138
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
-Jo… Jo
who? Jo Ricci

139
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,300
He knew my buddy

140
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He said to hang on, that he’d put us onto something big

141
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,100
So we went to Jo’s every night,
and tonight he told my buddy…

142
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,800
…well, “that chicken’s ripe for plucking”
 is what he said

143
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,300
Why tonight?

144
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,400
They killed Jacques three days ago

145
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,300
Were you told about her?

146
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,500
Just that she couldn’t go to the cops

147
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,000
Alban, let’s go

148
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,900
Where are we going?

149
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,400
Step on it, we’re there

150
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,800
I told Manouche to pick us up outside Ville d’Avray

151
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,900
My place is no good, Gu

152
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
We’ve had Homicide on our tails

153
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,600
Their boss is weird

154
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,500
Yes, Inspector Blot.
We heard quite a bit about him inside

155
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,300
How about Montrouge?

156
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,700
-What’s there?
-Don’t worry, you’ll be fine there

157
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
Your kingdom for a bit

158
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,200
The keys

159
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,800
-Who sent for him?
-He’s my wife’s cousin

160
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,000
I have to get back, but we’d better bury him in the garden first

161
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,000
I’d have met you if I’d known.
How did you get here, by air or by train?

162
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,700
By car.  I’m flying back right away

163
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,900
Why the fast trip?

164
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,700
The cigarette deal with Jacques the Notary…

165
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,600
He and Jeannot are both dead.  End of problem

166
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,100
Jeannot’s dead?

167
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,400
You’ll miss your partner, you always need one

168
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,700
Not always

169
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,600
I went to see my brother Jo, but I realized he wouldn’t do

170
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,600
But I’ve had another idea.
Orloff’s back in France; he’s in Marseilles

171
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,000
Yes, I know.  He has the reputation of being a lone wolf

172
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,100
Big money could change that

173
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,100
I agree.  I’ve asked him to call me at home tonight

174
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,100
Or better – and safer – to come and see us there

175
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,500
A man like Orloff would prefer that.
I’ve sent my wife to see her people

176
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,100
We’ll be alone

177
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,100
-Thanks for coming
When Paul asks, I come

178
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:27,000
Two friends and I have a proposition.
I’d like you to meet them

179
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,400
Pascal Leonetti

180
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,700
Orloff

181
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,900
Antoine Ripa

182
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Do you want to start the year with two million francs?

183
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
A year can begin in many ways;
maybe even not begin at all

184
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,800
Yes, but in this case I have first-hand information

185
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,900
It’s a month from now.
We’ll be given the time, everything

186
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,300
A shipment escorted by two motorcyclists:
500 kilos of platinum

187
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,800
Five shares of two million francs each.
 My informant insists on a share

188
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Four of us and him makes five

189
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,600
Is it getting so hard to find the right man?

190
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,600
As you see

191
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Your confidence overwhelms me

192
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,800
I presume the details are worked out:
I have only to accept or refuse?

193
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,400
I shall therefore ask no questions before deciding

194
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,300
I neither refuse or accept

195
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,100
I need a week in which to make up my mind

196
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,300
We have to be ready in four weeks

197
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:55,400
If I refuse, you will have three weeks
 to find a fourth, or settle on three

198
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
It’s impossible with three

199
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,800
Three is a good combination.  I’ve done jobs on my own, too

200
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,200
But all that platinum warrants handling with care

201
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,600
You’re quite entitled to look around
for someone else while I think it over

202
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,800
-Scotch?
A very small one

203
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,300
To our coming collaboration

204
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,800
Come in a moment, please

205
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,000
Check where these two hung out

206
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Tourneur and Bartel were at Jo Ricci’s
bar in Rue Washington every day

207
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
Two punks, stylishly iced by an ace hit man

208
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,000
Madame Simone Peltier is here

209
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,800
I’m glad to find you here, Inspector

210
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
I came to ask your permission to leave Paris

211
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,900
My cashier is back and I want to get away.
 This business is getting me down

212
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,100
It doesn’t show

213
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,900
We’ve know each other for a long time,
and you know what I think

214
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:58,300
For many women, men killing each other
over them would be the ultimate tribute

215
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,300
I settle for less

216
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Look…

217
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,200
These represent the death of two men…

218
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,200
…left half hidden, as if it hardly mattered
whether they were found or not

219
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,500
The work of a master

220
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,600
Go where you like, Manouche.  Sell up if you want…

221
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,100
…and meet new people, find yourself a new life

222
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,300
It wouldn’t be a bad move, Simone

223
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,500
You know, it’s a bit late to change, Inspector

224
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,700
For a woman like you?  You must be joking

225
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,100
Well?

226
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,900
Permission granted

227
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,300
Thank you

228
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Good luck

229
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,900
-What do you think?
Risky

230
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,900
More than you think

231
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,300
But people like that need a lot of rope

232
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,400
I’ll pay Jo Ricci a visit.  His brother Paul
got screwed in a cigarette deal

233
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,100
Cigarettes killed Jacques the Notary,
and Jo knows about it

234
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,000
The corpses in the car hung out at Jo’s bar

235
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:36,200
And Manouche is quite calm and easy,
as though she’d just found a champion

236
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,500
Look at him: he had a lot of money once

237
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,600
Now he’s broke, and won’t leave the
country that way of he can help it

238
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,500
He’s still dangerous

239
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
Gu, it’s me

240
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
She’s coming to dinner tonight.
I thought you’d like to dress up

241
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,200
She has news about your getaway

242
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,200
I’m off.  Someone has to see to the bar

243
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,200
You’re safe here, you know:
only the three of us know

244
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,400
Manouche said she’ll fix the dinner

245
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,700
It’s me

246
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,200
You shouldn’t have; I wanted to do it all myself

247
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,900
Why?  You’re the guest, aren’t you?

248
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,700
It’s not very nice here

249
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,500
Compared to where I’ve been and what’s ahead…

250
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,300
My picture must be in every cop’s pocket

251
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,300
So what?  A picture isn’t the same thing as the man

252
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,800
Cops aren’t all that bright

253
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,400
Which reminds me, I saw Blot this morning

254
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,100
He sort of flirted with me

255
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,600
Told me I could go wherever I liked, and so forth

256
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,400
Complete freedom, you know the sort of thing

257
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,900
Yes, I know the sort of thing

258
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,100
We have to play it Blot’s way

259
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,000
You and I, we grew up together on the wrong side of the law

260
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,900
It would be the end of the world
if we couldn’t get you clear away

261
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,400
Whatever happens, I’m not going back inside

262
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,900
And me?

263
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,400
What about you?

264
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,300
Where do I fit into all of this?

265
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,000
You haven’t understood at all,
have you, Manouche?

266
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,600
You know it happened: I gambled and I lost

267
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,000
It’s nobody’s fault.  Now they’re looking for me,
 and they’ll never stop

268
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,800
Good evening, Jo.  Discerning as ever

269
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,600
-Will you join us?
-That might be very pleasant

270
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Mesdemoiselles Colette and Marcelline.
What will you have, Inspector?  Cognac?

271
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,300
I never touch alcohol; but if I may
off these young ladies something?

272
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,100
I’ll have a tomato juice

273
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,200
Colette and I do everything together

274
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,500
The two of us are inseparable

275
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,500
I’m not a man I used to be, but I
cound try to get out of my appointment

276
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,500
May I make a call

277
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,300
Pity about the girls,
but I’m too busy

278
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,700
Don’t over do it, Inspector

279
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,800
Tell them my friend has left

280
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,300
I have two corpses on my hands,
so I thought of you

281
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,300
You’re too kind

282
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,600
-Heard from your brother Paul?
-He’s going straight now

283
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,900
He’ll be taking holy orders next

284
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,400
When Jacques the Notary bought it, Paul came to mind

285
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,500
Everyone knew Jacques… Manouche, too

286
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,600
And you know me.  Am I fool enough to
think Jacques died because of Manouche?

287
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,700
Opinions differ

288
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,500
I’m not here to play games or get at you

289
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,800
You’re right about opinions
 differing, and here’s what I think

290
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,600
You had nothing to do with it

291
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,200
Your brother Paul is liquidating opposition

292
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Jacques was the big fish in cigarettes.
Now Paul is taking things easy

293
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,100
More or less easy, I’d say,
because I know something you don’t know

294
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,100
Three days after Jacques…

295
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,000
…a couple of third-class punks,
hardly rating even that high…

296
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,100
…get taken for a ride at Ville
d’Avray – you’ve seen the papers?

297
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I knew them… just as customers,
I mean

298
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,900
Still the same old Jo

299
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,400
-What will you have, Inspector?
-A cognac

300
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,200
So this Tourneur and this Bartel used to come here, did they?

301
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:35,400
Two cheap crooks, yet they get
themselves killed like big shots

302
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,700
You realize what a scene those
 two upstarts wormed themselves into?

303
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,300
Unless someone fixed it

304
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,400
There’s a house close to the spot
 where we found the car…

305
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,300
…yet no one heard a thing

306
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,800
They were shot in the car while it
was still on the road

307
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,900
I spent the night combing a pile of
 records.  Guess what I found?

308
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:13,300
The death of Francis the Gimp, fifteen
 years ago.  A straight road, three shots

309
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:20,000
But at the time everyone thought that
 Gu did it.  I find that extraordinary

310
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
Don’t you?

311
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,400
It is funny

312
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,600
Gu has escaped.  Gu means
 Manouche and Alban

313
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,200
You mean Paul… by extension Jacques.
And Jacqes means Manouche and Alban

314
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:40,400
Get it?  Our two punks were here,
Probably heard about Manouche

315
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,700
I hadn’t thought of that

316
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,300
Never mind.  I’m paid to think,
and sometimes do it without thinking

317
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,700
So our two punks learn that
Manouche’s boyfriend is dead…

318
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,800
…and decide a visit to the widow
might bring easy pickings

319
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,100
Off they go, and run straight into Gu

320
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,500
We can fill in the details later.
Maybe

321
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,800
If he goes on like that,
he won’t stay out long

322
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,300
So much better for you

323
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,300
For me?

324
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,100
That Wop’s got nothing to do with me

325
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,000
Maybe he thinks he has

326
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,000
Gu would have wanted to know
who sent them

327
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,900
And if you ask me, they’re the kind
who talk

328
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:31,800
So your name was mentioned.  Gu will
love someone making trouble for Manouche

329
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,100
I don’t give a damn what he thinks

330
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,400
I’m not responsible for my customers

331
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,200
Suppose he disagrees?  He knows where
you are, but you don’t know where he is

332
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,800
Do you know?

333
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,900
Not yet, but I will

334
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,100
This Gu is crazy

335
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,100
How’s your son doing at school?

336
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,400
I’m sending him to England, then
Germany, to help with his exams

337
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,900
I hope you live to see him receive his diploma

338
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,000
I’m not afraid

339
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That won’t make the danger go away.
Think of your family

340
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,000
I must talk to you again.
I can’t think tonight

341
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,400
You know where to find me.
I’ll leave the back way

342
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,800
It’s me

343
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,500
I was fast asleep

344
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,200
I’ll take these, or she’ll
 go crazy looking for them

345
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,400
She’s leaving

346
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,200
She says she can’t stand the rain in
this country and that you need sun

347
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,400
She’ll make sure she isn’t followed,
then find you a hideout in Marseilles

348
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,200
Her cousin Theo Cassini has a boat.
You know him?

349
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,300
Sort of

350
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,800
He’ll tell you about papers,
depending on where you’re going

351
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,900
I’m broke, Alban.  I can’t leave
 the country empty handed

352
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,100
I know a place in Italy, but
 I need at least a small stake

353
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,800
I have an account to settle, too

354
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,500
I’d hate to leave Jo Ricci
to grow old and fat

355
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,000
Some things you can’t swallow

356
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,900
I know you’d insist on helping,
so maybe I’ll let it go

357
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,300
I’ll just do the driving

358
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,400
Here is Jo Ricci’s bar in Rue Washington,
with a back entry through the yard

359
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,100
This is where he lives,
in the Place des Etats-Unis

360
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,400
Have both telephones monitored…

361
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,200
…his home and the bar

362
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,000
I’ve got Jo nervous enough to make
a move. He may be getting a call

363
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,800
-What sort of call?
An invitation to a funeral

364
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,600
You won’t get advance notice.  Don’t
act until afterwards, and make it good

365
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,300
You won’t have time before, anyway

366
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,300
So, if I get you right, Chapter One:
Jo breakfasts on hot lead

367
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,600
Chapter Two: if we can’t act, we wait.
Who appears in Chapter Three?

368
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,800
Gu and Alban

369
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,400
-Isn’t in the bag
-No, it isn’t

370
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,800
Alban can hit a crow’s foot
at I forget how many paces

371
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,900
He’s why Manouche stays healthy

372
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,400
I told you about Gu the other night

373
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,600
If they come, Jo won’t eat Christmas
Turkey.  Only those two can get to him

374
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,900
So this is an order: if you don’t
have a clear shot, do nothing

375
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:42,200
It’s now or never.  I doubt if
Jo’s going to hang around for long

376
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,700
Leterrier’s in position at the bar.
Alban’s strolling along the street

377
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,800
And Jo Ricci’s booked on the
two o’clock flight to Corsica

378
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,600
At Jo Ricci’s house I saw luggage
being loaded into his Ford

379
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,900
If we’re quick, we can catch him
at the bar

380
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
Drive past without stopping

381
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,200
It’s a one-way

382
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,000
Go round the Etoile and come back

383
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,900
We’re at each end of the street.
Get Leterrier out of there

384
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,900
Alban checked the back entry

385
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,300
With luck there won’t be crowds about

386
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,400
We’re almost there

387
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,600
I’m not going in

388
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,200
Did you spot something?

389
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,500
No, it didn’t feel right

390
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,700
I think I’d better leave you here
until Manouche sends word what to do

391
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,900
My dear Alban… at a loose end?

392
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Out walking

393
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,900
So am I.  Shall we go this way?

394
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,500
-How’s your charming employer?
-She’s gone

395
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,900
She’d had enough

396
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,400
For how long a rest?

397
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,200
Oh, she just went…
 you know how it is

398
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,500
Everyone seems to be leaving.  I know
 someone who’s flown off to Corsica

399
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,200
Some have all the luck

400
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,700
But you’re staying?

401
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,400
I have to run the business
for Manouche

402
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,200
Not a word as the whereabouts
of Gustave Minda

403
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,700
He’s really covered his tracks

404
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,900
Old boars are always the hardest
 to flush out

405
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,400
And when you do, they always manage
to kill two or three hounds

406
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,700
I don’t enjoy hunting a man like that

407
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,900
That’s understandable.
I cross over here

408
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,600
Watch how you go

409
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,200
Long live the underworld!

410
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,600
Tell the boys that’s it for today

411
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
You’ve got to help me, Theo

412
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:54,700
I need a furnished house locally.
Price doesn’t matter, but no names

413
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,900
An out-of-the-way place where
I can hide someone

414
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,900
Who’ll be needing the boat?

415
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,200
It’s Gustave Minda

416
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,000
I thought so

417
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,500
Can you fix it?

418
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:15,000
There’s my father’s old house.
No one goes there in winter

419
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,200
I’ll go and get it ready

420
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,900
You’ll be saving his life

421
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,500
What about the boat?

422
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,400
It isn’t small fry.  It won’t be easy,
getting him through

423
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:32,000
-I’ll try it.  Does he have papers?
-Not yet

424
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,200
We’ll see to it

425
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:44,200
What’s this she’s dreamed up?
A crate marked “This side up”

426
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,900
I might do the trip upside-down, like a fakir

427
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,300
Cops are everywhere

428
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,400
Naturally.  What do you suppose it
was like after I went over the wall?

429
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,800
I live my own plan

430
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,000
Try to work it out right

431
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,300
I’m carrying

432
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,600
This is different.  I’ve never
been parted from it

433
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,300
My dear Alban…

434
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
-Is your boat in good shape, Theo?
-Still afloat, as you see

435
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,400
It could be on its way to Sicily
before very long

436
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:03,200
I’m going to be on a big deal…
or at least, maybe I am

437
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,800
I’ve got an Italian trip on, the south,
I think.  Maybe we could combine them

438
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,800
I’m not too keen.  Which is the
 riskiest bit, leaving or arriving?

439
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,200
Arriving, but mostly during
the trip itself

440
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,500
It’s something important?

441
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,800
You’ll be able to retire soon

442
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,300
-This one I’m only charging expenses
-You’ve changed

443
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,300
The thing is, he needs papers.
You can tell… it’s Gu

444
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,000
I’ll see to the papers.
When does he want to leave?

445
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,800
They’re waiting on me

446
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,800
His woman’s going, too

447
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,300
Tell him the papers will take a week,
 and he should grow a moustache

448
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,900
Also I need to get two photographs,
 or a film I’ll develop

449
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,700
Don’t mention my name

450
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:53,900
Money?

451
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,700
It’s strange, but I feel like
 making a donation, too

452
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,600
One other thing: ask Gu if he wants
to pick up two million before leaving

453
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,300
Miami’s fine for millionaires

454
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,900
Two million francs?

455
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,600
It’s the job I mentioned.
But I’ve got time, Gu hasn’t

456
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,400
It comes off in three weeks from now.
Tell Gu I need a quick decision

457
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,900
Meanwhile, no matter what,
I’ll see about those papers

458
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,800
We have to wait, though

459
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,500
Theo will see about the papers
and tell us when he can take us

460
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,300
I’m in no hurry to get to Italy broke

461
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,500
We’re not broke

462
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,300
Not us.  Me

463
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,600
I thought I was going along

464
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,300
Exactly

465
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,400
It’s Theo

466
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,900
I’ve got news

467
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:05,300
We need two photographs for papers.
I have a camera.  Also…

468
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,200
What would you say to two million?

469
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:17,300
Some guy needs a hand.  Equal shares:
two million francs each

470
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,600
Two million and you’re not
interested yourself?

471
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,100
I’m too old to risk it

472
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,000
You have some nerve!  Don’t you think
it’s risky for Gu, too?

473
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,700
Ask him if that gold train job
he did was easy

474
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,300
It didn’t kill me

475
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,700
What about your friend Roger?

476
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,400
-No one made him take part
-No one’s making you act stupid

477
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,500
I have no choice

478
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,500
I won’t let him do it

479
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,500
-Can you name names?
Paul… Paul Ricci

480
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,900
Count me in, then

481
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,300
If I’d known, I’d never
have got in touch with you

482
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,200
Listen, Manouche…

483
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,700
I know you’re straight, and I like
your care in choosing your team

484
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,600
I didn’t refuse on the spot
because it’s too big a deal

485
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,200
But I’ve considered carefully

486
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,100
If the hold-up is on the highway,
I can only take a few seconds

487
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,400
How can you deal with the motorcycle
escort in so short a time?

488
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,100
Kill them

489
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,700
In that case, two million
doesn’t seem enough to me

490
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:41,300
Don’t worry, a hundred million
wouldn’t be.  I’m opting out

491
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,100
Now, if I may, I’ll tell you about
someone who wants to opt in

492
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,000
No one asked you to do that

493
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,300
It’s a risky job

494
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,700
-Some foreigner?
-No

495
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,600
It’s someone you know well.
His name is Gustave Minda

496
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,000
Gu?  The cops are after him; I thought
he was far away by now

497
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,100
Gu here?  In this hole?

498
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:24,700
A last fling before leaving France.
He doesn’t know who’s in on it, though

499
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,000
Tell him about me, that he’s in, and
if he wants anything, just to ask

500
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,600
He won’t

501
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,500
The years inside must have aged him

502
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,300
I’ve met some of his cell mates

503
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,600
He’s finished.  He might crack
at any time

504
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,900
Yet he escaped

505
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:48,700
They got him out.  That guy who
escaped with him, Bernard…

506
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,900
…he jumped off a cliff when caught

507
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,100
The moral is don’t get caught.
Three of them escaped

508
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:00,400
Gu’s fine, the other two are dead.
I’ll answer for him

509
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,500
You don’t have to work with him

510
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,700
Gu will be in the car with Pascal and
me.  He’ll do fine, better than Jeannot

511
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,800
I’m sure of that

512
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,400
What about afterwards?

513
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,700
During and after.  But so what?
I’ll do my job and take my cut

514
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,100
If things go wrong in the car,
you’ll have to do his job

515
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,800
Afterwards, you said?

516
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,800
Yes.  Gu hasn’t moved with the times

517
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,900
His ideas could lead to problems

518
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,800
I’ll answer for afterwards, too

519
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,700
In that case, I agree

520
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:41,000
-Can we talk details with Gu?
-If you meet me here two hours before hand

521
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:46,100
-How soon will we know when?
-We’ll know the time the day before

522
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,600
Let me know; Gu will be there

523
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:54,200
By the way, don’t mention my name.
Gu doesn’t know I’m involved

524
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,900
He’d want to see me, and I’d rather
not know where he’s hiding out

525
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,300
Some you trust, some you don’t

526
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,400
Gentlemen, you know you have
my good wishes

527
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,000
He’s beginning to get up my nose

528
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,000
I wouldn’t let it show

529
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,400
What could he do, for all his airs?

530
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,400
If you want to grow old to enjoy
your cut, forget Orloff

531
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,500
Tell Alban to stop worrying.
My luck’s come back

532
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,000
Suppose things go wrong,
what could I do?

533
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,900
When you get back, everything will be fine

534
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,500
Here’s Theo

535
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,500
The same night, 23.58

536
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,200
The van and two motorcycles escorts
leave Toulon tomorrow at two p.m.

537
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,500
They’ll head for Cap d’Agde
along secondary roads

538
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,400
There’ll be a man sitting beside
the driver…

539
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,200
…and another with the crates
in the back

540
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,800
I’m glad you’re here, Gu

541
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Gypsy?

542
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,900
Come and sit down

543
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,100
Get him a drink, Antoine

544
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,200
-How do you feel?
Don’t worry, it’ll be fine

545
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,900
It’s a load off our minds
to have you with us

546
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,500
Tell me about it, Paul

547
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:25,200
It’s a big one, Gu, but it means
split-second timing

548
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,500
We’ve picked a pretty wild spot

549
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,300
Antoine will stash an estate car, and
hide on top of the hill with a rifle

550
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,500
There’s a hut right there to lock away
the three guys from the van

551
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,200
We’ve a hideout near at hand

552
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,500
The van will be escorted by
 two motorcyclists

553
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,800
We drive up in the Mercedes

554
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,200
Not far from Antoine…

555
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,400
…an unmade road joins the main
road at the bend

556
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,300
We wait there till the convoy passes

557
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,500
If we followed it too long,
they’d get suspicious

558
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,700
We jump them as soon as Antoine kills
 the first motorcyclist.  The second…

559
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,500
I kill from the car.  That terrifies
the men in the van

560
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,900
We lock them up and go home, right?

561
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,300
Aren’t you afraid they might reinforce
the escort at the last moment?

562
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,900
No.  No chance

563
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,400
My informant is the man who
gives the orders

564
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,400
He asked for two motor-cyclists,
not four

565
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:50,200
The platinum will be in twenty cases,
each twenty-five kilos

566
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,700
About this big, with hand grips,
easy to handle

567
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,200
I think that’s all

568
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:06,600
About the motorcyclists… if we
could have avoided killing them…

569
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:12,100
But if one of them gets away,
we blow it

570
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,200
Besides, the men inside will be armed,
if they’re scared, they’ll keep quiet

571
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,500
Groundsheets?

572
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,400
To cover the bodies with;
saves moving them elsewhere

573
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,100
Good idea

574
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,700
Right, you never know.  I’ve a
big one we can cut in two

575
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,000
What’s the time?

576
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,000
12:05

577
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,500
You can get started, I think,
 but don’t drive too fast

578
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,100
Remember to change the plates
en route

579
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,900
Let me hear your gun drop

580
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,400
What happened?

581
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,700
I don’t know.  I thought I heard shots

582
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,300
Get in, or I’ll kill you

583
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,300
It’s me!

584
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,400
I found him looking at
one of the bodies

585
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:53,100
The place belongs to my in-laws

586
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,700
Forty-five minutes since it started

587
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,800
When the van doesn’t arrive, they’ll
phone Toulon to see what’s up

588
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,300
Well, I’m off.  Who’s coming with me?

589
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:22,900
Me

590
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:27,000
Do you want to come with Pascal
when he picks up the cases?

591
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,000
There’s no need, I trust you

592
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,800
Let me know when, and I’ll come for my cut

593
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,300
You should stay with us

594
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:49,300
Maybe you won’t be around when
 I go to Paul’s place to collect

595
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,600
Maybe

596
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:54,500
I just wanted to say it was good
working with you

597
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,200
I was against you being in on it

598
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,200
But I don’t know…
those motorcyclists…

599
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,800
It was just you and me

600
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:26,000
Your informant… only he would have
known all the details

601
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,500
He’ll be questioned, and he’s
 not like us

602
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,700
-But we can’t…
-We must

603
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,500
-Only Paul knows him
-Then let Paul do it

604
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,700
Drop me at the station

605
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:59,800
Good Luck!

606
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,300
Marseilles, please

607
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:18,600
That’s it for today.  Everyone
back to the station

608
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,500
-Give us a break, Inspector
Bet your life I wll!

609
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,900
You’ve made an arrest already,
haven’t you?

610
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,500
Playing coy won’t help your promotion

611
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:56,700
You here?  I’m too busy to bother
with you

612
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,600
Nice Christmas present you’ve got

613
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:06,400
Killing police escorts, hit and run
style.  Someone will pay for this!

614
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,200
If you can present the bill

615
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,600
Ten years I’ve been on the job
and I know them all

616
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,500
No one gets smart with me.  Wait till
I’ve worked some of them over

617
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,600
I’m sure you’ll be delighted
to co-operate

618
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:25,900
It’s an order to hand over the
bullets removed from the bodies

619
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:34,200
Because we’re no experts, unlike you,
I suppose?

620
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:38,400
Very well.  Make a necklace of them
 if you like

621
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,900
I shall not let your attitude
go unremarked, Fardiano

622
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:08,400
See if these bullets are from the gun
used in the Ville d’Avray killings

623
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,300
Two marksmen, one with a Colt,
the other with a rifle

624
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:30,100
Witnesses in Marseilles
are of no help

625
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:34,300
They say the car was navy, pale green,
maroon, black

626
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,100
As to the make, it wasn’t French

627
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,200
This is the laboratory

628
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,400
It’s the same Colt

629
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,400
Gentlemen, our Marseilles killer
also did the Ville d’Avray job

630
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,100
Now listen carefully

631
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:59,400
Jo Ricci sent two hoods after Manouche,
probably to blackmail her

632
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:04,400
They were nabbed and killed in a car heading
for the Ville d’Avray.  By Whom?

633
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I’d say by Gu, he used the same method
on Francis the Gimp fifteen years ago

634
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:15,500
Afterwards, he didn’t get rid of the
Colt he used

635
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,000
He’s no longer your average killer;
he knows he’s done for

636
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,600
On the Marseilles job…

637
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,600
…he killed the motorcycle escort
with the same gun…

638
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:31,100
…because he was used to it he wouldn’t
try a new one on an important job

639
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:34,000
Now let’s consider the others

640
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:39,200
Manouche returned to Paris before the
job.  Alban never left Paris

641
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:43,800
So Gu was in on it with
 other associates.  Now he’s flush

642
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,800
It’ll be a month or two before
he can cash in and leave the country

643
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:53,300
That’s all we know

644
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,400
Manouche and Alban will try to see him

645
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,800
Yes, but they have no problem
shaking a tail

646
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,400
I’d rather give them a bit of rope

647
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,000
Fardiano?

648
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:13,500
He won’t come up with anything.  He’ll
pull in a few suspicious characters

649
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:18,500
The guys who did the job are something
else.  After all, they knew Gu

650
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:23,600
Policemen aren’t magicians, you know

651
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:29,500
If we don’t get a break, Gu will be off and that’ll be it

652
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,000
We can lay our hands on the others

653
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:36,400
But someone in hiding is easier
 to find

654
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,600
He’s behaving abnormally

655
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,100
We could run pictures in the papers

656
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:45,500
No pictures.  Gu wouldn’t venture out,
and we want him to do that

657
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,600
So have to trust to luck.  Or fate

658
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,300
Call it what you will

659
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:56,500
We need something, then we can
go to work on it

660
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:41,800
Police four hours late at scene
 of bloody hold-up

661
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:57,100
Luckily his name isn’t mentioned
anywhere

662
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,300
Just as well Blot isn’t in
on this

663
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,300
The Parisian police don’t stick their noses into regional affairs

664
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,800
No, of course

665
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,700
I’ve a crazy hankering to go
to Marseilles

666
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:16,300
But I’m scared I might start
something if I do

667
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,600
I’ll be right back

668
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,000
I’m off, then

669
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,700
I have two things to say, if I may

670
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,900
Pascal will tell you what I feel
about your informant

671
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:33,700
Your brother Jo…

672
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:37,000
Yes, I know, but he’s my brother

673
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,100
Tell him nothing

674
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:41,000
You’re pushing it

675
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,300
His dealings are sometimes a bit off

676
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,300
He never knew, but I nearly
knocked him off

677
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:51,800
He ran away, anyway,
guilty conscience

678
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,200
You want to know about it?

679
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,800
His brother is O.K.

680
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:04,500
As a favor for you, Paul, I’ll
let him live to a ripe old age

681
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:13,500
Even if I wasn’t on the run,
I think I wouldn’t stay here

682
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:22,700
-Now what?
I fade into the background

683
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,500
Take care

684
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,000
Keep your hands where they are

685
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:06,700
You can get out

686
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:17,100
This is where the guy who escaped
with you got surrounded

687
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,000
He jumped from up there

688
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:28,300
We thought you’d like to die here.
I know you’re the sentimental type

689
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,800
Not too chatty, are you?

690
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:35,700
We didn’t bring you here to talk about
your life or your platinum

691
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,900
We don’t give a damn about that

692
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,700
You’ve sunk low, Gu.  Very low

693
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,200
You don’t care who you work with

694
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,200
Sorry, but Angel won’t stand
for that

695
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,600
Angel?

696
01:42:54,100 --> 01:42:55,100
Nevada?

697
01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:00,000
That was our job, and Angel doesn’t
like being double crossed

698
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:04,300
You know that, Gu.  We’ve got you…

699
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:07,300
…and we’ll find the others

700
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:11,200
You’re all going to get it,
one after another

701
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:16,000
Angel knows me.  Ten years inside and
I didn’t say a word.  I haven’t changed

702
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:21,100
Yet you stabbed him in the back
for a few bars of platinum

703
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:26,000
Is Nevada crazy, or what?  He knows
I’ve been out of circulation

704
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:30,900
I was offered a job.  If there was any
funny business, I wasn’t in on it

705
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:37,300
Well, you see, Angel thinks different

706
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:40,500
Does the work of a man like me
mean nothing?

707
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:43,700
Look at you, with your hoods
and your guns…

708
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:47,500
…talking nothing but crap.
What do you know about me?

709
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:51,200
You know nothing!  Did Angel dream
I’d double cross him?

710
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,600
Is he crazy, or what?

711
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:57,600
Ricci, now, do you think he’s
on the level?

712
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,800
-Which one?
-Both

713
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,900
Yes, both of them, Jo and Paul

714
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,800
-Paul is my friend
-So what?

715
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:11,500
-Then you weren’t in on it?
-On my word.  Angel could be wrong

716
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,000
No, he couldn’t

717
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:18,800
He had five million coming, and
he hasn’t received a single franc

718
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,000
It’s impossible. Or else Paul’s
gone mad

719
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,100
Nevada turned the job over for a 50%
cut: day, time, everything

720
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:32,300
Instead, Paul kept the lot, and
you’re splitting it four ways

721
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:35,100
Four ways?  No, five

722
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,700
Our informant had to have his cut

723
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,900
That’s the best joke yet!

724
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:46,300
The informant was Nevada

725
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,100
So Paul grabbed himself a double share

726
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:11,700
Listen carefully, now.  I’ve changed
my mind a bit

727
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:15,200
Paul’s for it, no question about that

728
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:20,800
But we want to see the others.
Maybe they were taken, like you

729
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:25,500
Why don’t you take us to them?

730
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,900
You don’t want much

731
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,600
You won’t?

732
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:50,600
Sorry.  Blot of Homicide.
We’ve taped the conversation

733
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:53,600
Everything’s legal

734
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:57,000
I won’t sign a statement, you…

735
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Tell that to Fardiano… and
Paul Ricci.  My job is done

736
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:36,500
Gu Minda did the job with Paul Ricci.
You may find this recording useful

737
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,000
It’s phony, I didn’t talk!

738
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,700
He will here, they all do

739
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:48,400
A silly thing: a warder from the jail
you were in was on leave

740
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:52,300
He was playing boule and he
recognized you in the crowd

741
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,700
Much it does me, knowing that

742
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:57,000
Handcuff him to the pipes

743
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,100
The worst thing about it is that
your reputation’s going to suffer

744
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:14,200
Paul isn’t going to like it.  You
used to keep your mouth shut

745
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:20,000
Time was when anyone hobnobbing with
regional police would be cut dead…

746
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,800
…and police didn’t fraternize with crooks

747
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,300
Now you’re all pals together
and pass each other tips

748
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:32,200
It makes the job easy, but
it makes me want to be sick

749
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:36,600
Try not to be sick here.
Fardiano’s no nurse

750
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:41,000
I’m going back to Paris.  Any messages
for Manouche and Alban?

751
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,500
Friends of yours?

752
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:48,200
No, yours.  Old friends

753
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:53,300
Inspector… you make me laugh

754
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,900
Go ahead, while you still have
a head on your shoulders

755
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:09,800
Well, big shot?  We’re picking up your
friend, then we can all work this out

756
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:15,000
You’ve already shopped him.
Why not tell us a bit more?

757
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,200
I don’t like being looked at like that

758
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:23,200
You won’t be so proud
when I’m done with you

759
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,800
I’ll have my lawyers on you for this!

760
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:32,800
One of your friends says he did that
 platinum job we know so little about

761
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:37,200
He also says you were in on it,
so we picked you up

762
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:41,000
You’ll make us lose our tempers,
shouting like that

763
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:43,700
Keep it for the peasants

764
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:52,900
Listen to this

765
01:48:53,500 --> 01:48:56,000
On my word.  Angel could be wrong

766
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,100
No, he couldn’t

767
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:02,800
He had five million coming, and
 he hasn’t received a single franc

768
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
It’s impossible.  Or else Paul’s
gone mad

769
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:11,600
Nevada turned the job over for a 50%
cut: day, time, everything

770
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:16,900
Instead, Paul kept the lot, and
you’re splitting it four ways

771
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,800
Four ways?  No, five

772
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,100
Our informant had to be cut in

773
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:28,100
That’s the best joke yet!

774
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,200
Our informant was Nevada

775
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,800
So Paul grabbed himself
a double share…

776
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,200
Well, was I bluffing?

777
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,800
It’s not true!

778
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,000
Remorse is to be expected

779
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Is this a madhouse?

780
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
That depends on who we get here

781
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:54,200
I’m innocent.  I know nothing,
met no one!

782
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,500
I want a lawyer!

783
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,400
Bring up a chair

784
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:16,900
You’ll find it easier to talk.  Where
were you on the afternoon of the 28th?

785
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:22,300
At home.  I went down with flu
on Christmas Eve

786
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:25,400
-We’ll check that.  Anyone see you?
-My wife

787
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,700
-Anyone else?
-Isn’t she enough?

788
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:32,500
Sure.  Naturally no one else saw you
because you were out killing policemen

789
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,800
If you have the flu, people don’t pay
social calls

790
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,100
You?  At home with your wife?

791
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:40,800
We love each other.  Is that against the law?

792
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,100
He must be thirsty.  Give him a drink

793
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:50,400
I don’t think it was you who shot
the two motorcyclists

794
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:53,200
You were driving, weren’t you?

795
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:57,800
You won’t be able to claim we
 roughed you up: no bruises

796
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:02,400
Be reasonable.  You’ll make us
get cross

797
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,800
Wouldn’t it be more sensible to talk,
especially if you were driving?

798
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:10,900
I know nothing about a car,
 and I haven’t done anything

799
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:13,600
I want to see my lawyer

800
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,800
Here we go again

801
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,600
Do you know him?

802
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,300
No, I’ve never seen him before

803
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:29,100
But there are limits!
He is a human being

804
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:32,800
Weren’t the two motorcyclists?
Didn’t they have families?

805
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,900
Did you give them a chance?  No,
 you condemned them without a hearing

806
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,900
I’m sure you’ll adopt their kids

807
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,400
Confess, that’s all I ask

808
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:48,700
Out already!  “The bloody hold-up
affair”

809
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,200
“To save his life, Gu Minda talked”

810
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:58,400
“One of his associates, Paul Ricci,
is in custody.  Other arrests imminent”

811
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:06,900
Ambulance!

812
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:14,700
He hates being thought a squealer.
Make sure the word gets around

813
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,900
He didn’t talk, I know that

814
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:26,600
It’s a lie, to make people desert him

815
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,900
No one will believe that,
 Gu was arrested first

816
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:31,300
Do you?

817
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:35,400
I don’t give a damn.
For me, Gu is Gu

818
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:38,900
Mine alone

819
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,000
He won’t want to live with people believing that

820
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:44,300
So we help?

821
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:49,500
We’ll wait a few days.  It’s no use
with the cops on the alert

822
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:56,100
I warned him, but your brother
swore by Gu

823
01:52:56,100 --> 01:53:00,400
It’s no surprise.  Even in prison,
Gu didn’t toe the line

824
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,800
It’s a pity Paul didn’t check with me.
It’s obvious Gu squealed

825
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:11,200
Let’s wait till Paul’s hearing.
There’s only Gu’s word against him

826
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:14,200
Let’s hope that’s all Gu says

827
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,400
He and Orloff are two of a kind

828
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,500
Yes, Paul bawled me out because
I didn’t care for Orloff’s airs

829
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,400
Orloff was in on this?

830
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,800
We went to see him because
he put Gu in touch with Paul

831
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,600
He’s still in Marseilles

832
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:35,100
Let’s ask what he thinks about Gu

833
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:36,900
We should do just that

834
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,300
Tell him I’m waiting

835
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,600
He won’t be overjoyed

836
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,300
A friend… Gu’s woman

837
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:53,900
Orloff, a friend of Gu’s.
I’ve been in touch

838
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,300
-You’ve seen him?
-No, I haven’t seen him

839
01:53:56,700 --> 01:54:00,000
Could you find a way for me to see him?

840
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,500
I’ll try.  I’ll come back tomorrow
around three, to let you know

841
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:15,300
How will this turn out for Gu?

842
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:20,100
With a woman like that on his side,
his troubles will fade away

843
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:23,300
Meanwhile, I have to see Jo Ricci

844
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:27,000
I’ve set up a meeting in a place I own

845
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,100
Watch yourself.  Jo Ricci has a lousy reputation

846
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:34,300
I’m more worried about that kid Antoine

847
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,800
This is serious about Paul

848
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:54,500
He’s always used good men

849
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,600
Them, too

850
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:58,100
Paul’s inside, not them

851
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,600
You wished that louse on Paul,
who was sorry for him

852
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:04,500
You’ve been fed lies

853
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Let’s stick to you and Gu

854
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:11,300
Alright.  If Gu denounced Paul,
why not you two as well?

855
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:14,900
Seeing Paul, maybe

856
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,600
He’ll shop us if he gets scared again

857
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,800
I think a trap was laid for him.
Inspector Blot has been around

858
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:26,700
Traps don’t work if you keep your
mouth shut and mind your airs

859
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,300
You got Paul into this

860
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,200
I’m ready to help

861
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:36,200
Paul has a brother and friends

862
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:39,000
You take care of Gu

863
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:40,800
I see

864
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:47,000
Gu had help all around since his escape,
and it’ll probably continue

865
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:53,000
If he escapes again, kill him
 and we’ll say no more

866
01:59:53,300 --> 01:59:54,600
It’s only right

867
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,600
And we’ll all rest easy

868
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,800
You have it all worked out

869
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:02,200
I like to know where I stand

870
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:11,000
If it can be proved that Gu squealed,
he dies

871
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:13,900
Haven’t you read the papers?

872
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:19,700
They don’t mention Blot.  Only Gu,
Blot and Fardiano know the truth

873
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:24,900
My brother has talked to his lawyer.
  Gu shopped him all right

874
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:30,100
Your brother trusted Gu completely.
 He was all for it when I suggested him

875
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:34,400
That’s no reason.  I have all the
proof I need

876
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:37,500
Gu has got to die

877
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:42,300
Listen, Fardiano isn’t
particulary bright

878
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:48,300
I can make enquiries.  If they confirm
what you say, I’ll kill Gu

879
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:50,100
If not?

880
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,400
It’s not my concern

881
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:55,100
We needn’t follow suit

882
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,600
You can do as you like

883
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,900
And if we can’t get to Gu,
we can always settle with you

884
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,900
When?

885
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:11,100
Whenever you like

886
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:41,500
People get worked up in situations
 like this.  You talk too much

887
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:48,900
You’re looking out for Paul, and that’s
fine.  But I’m not on your payroll

888
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,300
A brother is a brother;
I quite understand

889
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:57,500
But keep your friend under control.  I won’t say that again.

890
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:02,300
If Gu squealed, he dies.
That’s all I have to say

891
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:50,700
I know you’ve done nothing to
blame yourself for

892
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:55,900
I came out with his name.
Me, Gu Minda!  Do you realize…

893
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,100
I have to get him out

894
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:03,900
His lawyers will tell him
 you didn’t sign a statement

895
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:07,100
A taped voice won’t be enough
to convict him

896
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:11,000
The bastard Fardiano’s getting
his own back, saying I talked

897
02:05:11,300 --> 02:05:14,500
I can’t bear that.  It isn’t possible

898
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:25,100
No… you deserved better than this

899
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:28,000
I should have never come back

900
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:32,400
Yes, you should

901
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:09,200
Drive on till I tell you to stop.
We’re going to have a chat

902
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:16,300
Pull up on the left

903
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:28,900
Switch off

904
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:33,600
Take this

905
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:39,200
You’re going to write an open letter
to the press…

906
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:43,600
…saying you lied about me because
you couldn’t make me talk

907
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:49,500
How Blot tricked me, and there’s no
proof Paul and I admit nothing

908
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:53,800
Got the idea?  Go ahead, then,
 and make it convincing

909
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:10,300
Right.  Now sign it

910
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:14,500
Since you’re the in the mood, write
another to the Minister of Justice

911
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,600
Tell him the same thing

912
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,300
Tell him how you get your confessions

913
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:24,700
Say you’re sorry and you’ll never
do it again

914
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,600
-Handcuffs in which pocket?
-The left

915
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:47,000
Lean forward against the wheel

916
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:51,500
Put your hands behind you…
both of them

917
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:10,800
Smile!

918
02:08:33,300 --> 02:08:36,800
One wonders where the papers get their stories…

919
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:39,300
Not from you, of course

920
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:41,600
They misinterpreted me

921
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:46,400
You know, I wasn’t very proud of
killing that motorcyclist

922
02:08:46,700 --> 02:08:49,100
-Why are you telling me this?
-Isn’t it your job to know?

923
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:55,000
There were four of us.  Antoine Ripa,
Pascal Leonetti, Paul and me

924
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:56,700
Stop it!

925
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:01,000
Antoine was waiting with a rifle

926
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,300
I’m not listening!

927
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:07,800
That’s a shame, I know lots of people
who’d like to

928
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:16,000
You’ve changed, but not all that much

929
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:24,300
Don’t play the lone wolf.
You’ll get nowhere

930
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:26,100
I was so worried

931
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:29,000
Some things have to be done

932
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:38,200
Hundreds of cops are looking for you;
you can’t go out

933
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:41,700
Jo Ricci, Pascal and Antoine
are after you, too

934
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,200
Let me finish.  I’m meeting them today

935
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:50,600
I’ll ask for a few hours to prove
you didn’t shop Paul

936
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,800
Meanwhile, you vanish with Manouche

937
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:55,600
What about Paul?

938
02:10:56,100 --> 02:11:00,700
Forget Paul.  His wife and his lawyers
 will take good care of him

939
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:04,600
But I’ll see Fardiano and try to…

940
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,500
Suppose Fardiano won’t play?

941
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:11,800
Then I’ll have it out with the others.
 No problem

942
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:17,100
Meanwhile, I sit here while Manouche
makes me a cup of tea?

943
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:22,400
You won’t have time for that.  Blot
and his men arrived last night

944
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:24,000
Blot is here?

945
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:27,600
He’ll have his work cut out

946
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,200
He works fast.  You’d better leave

947
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:33,300
Not till I clear my name

948
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:35,100
That’s my job

949
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:37,600
No, it’s mine

950
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:43,000
This is Fardiano’s confession.
He wrote it before he died

951
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:27,600
Why have you…

952
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:31,700
Because I don’t need it anymore

953
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:40,600
This is for Alban

954
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:46,300
Fardiano’s confession.  Don’t leave it
with them; the newspapers will want it

955
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:47,800
I’ll be back

956
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:52,600
Tell me where you’re going, so I’ll know just in case

957
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:55,300
There’s no need, I’ll be fine

958
02:12:56,100 --> 02:12:59,700
I trust you, but my whole life
is in this book

959
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:04,500
I put myself on the line to get it.
Anything could happen; I’d rather know

960
02:13:05,700 --> 02:13:08,400
1, Rue Vinci.  Third floor

961
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:12,100
All clear outside?

962
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:03,600
Hold it, Antoine!

963
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:17,400
A bit of a shock, I expect?

964
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:21,700
Are you in the chair, Jo?

965
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:24,300
Nothing to say?

966
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:33,200
So you’re here to avenge Paul?
 That’s nice

967
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:39,700
I’ve Fardiano’s confession in my
pocket.  Do you take my word?

968
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:43,000
I believe you, Gu

969
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:47,600
That’s nice.  What about you two?

970
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:52,700
Sitting like stuffed dummies…
did you hear?

971
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:58,400
He believes me.  So what was
all this fuss about?

972
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:01,100
Where’s Orloff?

973
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:04,200
Shut up!  I’m doing all the talking

974
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
And you, Pascal, have you nothing
to say?

975
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,200
I’m all for believing you

976
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:19,100
That’s nice.  So you just came along
 to pass the time

977
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:26,500
So you two will leave here telling
everyone it was all a misunderstanding?

978
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:32,900
Anyone can make a mistake

979
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:38,600
I wasn’t talking to you, Jo

980
02:16:42,300 --> 02:16:44,900
Put your hands up high

981
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:50,400
Back up

982
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Turn around

983
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:21,800
You see before you
the world’s biggest rat

984
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:24,000
He lives as a scavenger

985
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:28,800
Right now he’s after his brother’s
loot, and probably his wife, too

986
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:34,400
If he could send his brother to the
guillotine, he wouldn’t hesitate

987
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:14,400
Third floor

988
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:16,000
Go to the second floor

989
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,800
Throw down your weapons, Gu

990
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:16,300
Manouche

991
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:26,100
A real massacre. Jo Ricci, Antoine
 Rip and Pascal Leonetti

992
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,700
Please let me through

993
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:58,900
Let her through

994
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:05,300
It’s all over, Manouche

995
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,700
Did he say anything?

996
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,900
Not a thing

997
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:15,700
Go home, Manouche; go back to Paris

998
02:21:34,500 --> 02:21:36,100
What happened?

999
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:39,700
Gu Minda killed three men
and died himself

1000
02:21:45,300 --> 02:21:47,000
You dropped something

1001
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:53,100
I did?

1002
02:21:53,900 --> 02:21:55,100
I’m sure of it
