1
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,216
How are you, David?

2
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:00,517
Bored?

3
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:04,346
I'm Marie.

4
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:05,752
I'm Jeanne.

5
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:06,754
I know.

6
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:08,560
Oh, you do?

7
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,671
You're a great dancer.

8
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,507
Thanks.

9
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,607
You're a pleasure to watch.

10
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,541
It's my job.

11
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:34,944
You're a dancer?

12
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:37,688
Right' it's my job.

13
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:41,560
Sorry, usuaIIy I'm faster. . .

14
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:47,030
You're beautiful, that's enough.

15
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,598
Just a joke.

16
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,368
Know anyone here?

17
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:59,572
Not reaIIy. Frank is
my husband's best friend.

18
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:03,081
I know.
I know Frank well.

19
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:04,908
Known him for ages.

20
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:07,750
I'm his cousin.

21
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,117
I won't be staying long.

22
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:14,926
Me, neither.

23
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,820
I'm working tomorrow.

24
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,798
At parties like this
I like going wild.

25
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,331
I won't stop you.

26
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:28,663
Fancy a dance?

27
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:48,351
- I feel like a big oaf next to you.
- Of course.

28
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,923
- You are one.
- You're awfuI.

29
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,475
I'll just copy you.

30
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:27,064
She's beautiful.

31
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,398
Who is?

32
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:29,626
Your wife.

33
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:36,868
I know.

34
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:43,641
Can I ask what's so funny?

35
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,547
Just girI's taIk.

36
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,548
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

37
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,586
I'll get our coats.

38
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:56,491
Well, see you soon.

39
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,887
- You'll come?
- Sure.

40
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:00,760
I'll give you my number.

41
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,668
Here.

42
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:13,167
Let's go.

43
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:16,611
Hang on, Frank's cousin
is giving me her number.

44
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:29,762
You two have the giggles.

45
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,231
- That's nice.
- It's nothing.

46
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:33,729
Here. . .

47
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:36,457
Well, David. . .

48
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:37,964
- See you.
- Bye.

49
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,706
I'm counting on you.

50
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:47,779
You'II come?

51
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:50,481
Let's go.

52
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,612
His cousin's nice.

53
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,829
I had a good time.

54
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:07,293
- Did you know her?
- By sight.

55
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:12,127
See, you ended up enjoying it.

56
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,002
And you didn't want to go.

57
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,408
Lucky she was there.

58
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,812
Frank's a good guy.

59
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,482
- I shouId see more of him.
- Do.

60
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,689
I'm going to start dancing again.

61
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,363
Does that hurt?

62
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:45,836
Gently. . .

63
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:47,967
Now push.

64
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:49,368
Spread your legs.

65
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:51,375
Better?

66
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:36,419
Marie's not home.
Marie is dancing.

67
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,384
Hello, who's that?

68
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:09,714
- Well, you're calling me.
- I just dialed *69.

69
00:10:10,223 --> 00:10:13,249
This is Jeanne Mazzotti, osteopath.

70
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:14,188
Jeanne?

71
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,894
Yes. Who's this?

72
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:17,863
It's Marie.

73
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:19,896
You called, then?

74
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,200
Yes, but I didn't dare
leave a message.

75
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,238
Hold on.

76
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,142
I'll help you up.

77
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:33,038
Okay?

78
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:38,910
See, I found you again.

79
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:42,147
I wanted to find out
about dance classes.

80
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:45,086
Saturday, 1 1 am, for beginners.

81
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:47,791
Are you ready? Not scared?

82
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,555
See you tomorrow.

83
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:00,837
Mom !

84
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:02,440
Hang on, Louis. . .

85
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:06,440
I'm looking for something.

86
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,818
You've been looking for an hour.

87
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,847
Because I can't find it.

88
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,421
Can't find what exactly?

89
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,423
My dance things.

90
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:23,788
You dance?

91
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:27,325
I used to a while back.
I'm starting again.

92
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,267
Before I was born?

93
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:31,030
What?

94
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,263
When you were young?

95
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,207
I'm still young.

96
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,708
You're late.

97
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,118
Not too tired?

98
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,892
- Why not go tomorrow?
- I promised dad we'd be there.

99
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,188
My brother's coming to play poker.

100
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:02,228
Don't put him to bed too late.
He's already tired.

101
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,562
He's eaten. . .
I made sandwiches for you.

102
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:08,036
You're a doll. By the way. . .

103
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:08,864
I know.

104
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,502
- Where's she going?
- Dance.

105
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:13,838
Dance!

106
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:21,712
Cut it out!

107
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,883
Help me out here.

108
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:27,151
You want that? HoId on. . .

109
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,522
- This?
- DreadfuI thing.

110
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:34,928
- A swimsuit?
- No, it's for dance.

111
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,567
Careful. . . Put your seatbelt on.

112
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:50,205
- Back on Sunday between 7 and 8pm.
- Be careful. And call me!

113
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:53,912
Don't forget.

114
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,250
Great! See you next week!

115
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:51,680
Hop on, we'll go for dinner.

116
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,421
No, I'm going home.

117
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:55,753
You're upset?

118
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,122
I'm not upset.

119
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:01,528
I would be if I were you.

120
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,026
I'm just in a hurry.

121
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,702
Come on, jump on.

122
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:08,539
You're not hungry?

123
00:17:09,308 --> 00:17:11,173
On a diet or something?

124
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,109
Move before you have a fight.

125
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,942
I won't budge unless you get on.

126
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,950
You're crazy.

127
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,550
And you're a pushover.

128
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,486
Hey, don't over-estimate yourself.

129
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:36,963
Not eating?

130
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:39,861
Sure. . .

131
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,174
You don't like it?

132
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,646
I always order what I don't like.

133
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:57,049
Swap, if you like?

134
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:59,256
Do you like it?

135
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:09,056
I'm sorry I was hard you on before.

136
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,361
That's okay.

137
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:14,336
I really wanted to. . .

138
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,237
To be hard on me?

139
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:21,238
To look after you.

140
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,444
You'd have a job.

141
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:28,543
No, you're fine.

142
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,052
You've got the basics, but. . .

143
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,559
But what?

144
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,540
I haven't danced for ages.

145
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:54,736
Really? How Iong?

146
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:59,441
Ten years.

147
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:03,080
A long time.
Didn't you miss it?

148
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,554
Sure.

149
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,465
I always wanted to be a dancer.

150
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:21,805
Me, too.

151
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:26,172
Well, you are one.

152
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,675
Plenty of things I haven't done.

153
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,781
Things I never will do.

154
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,353
Things I've never had
or ever will have.

155
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:43,961
So now everything I get, I keep.

156
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:48,497
You're right to.

157
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:55,866
And now I'm keeping you.
You can call your David.

158
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:58,166
He's gone away.

159
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:06,817
I'm off to the sea. Come with me.

160
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,186
With you?

161
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:15,783
Fetch my brother from school
in Normandy, and go to the sea.

162
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,124
To the sea?

163
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:25,333
Hardly the end of the earth !

164
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,904
Yes, but just like that. . .

165
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,540
Do what you like.

166
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,509
But I have to go.

167
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:25,289
I'm on the freeway. . .

168
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,625
Just like that. . .

169
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:33,132
It'll do me good. . .
Yes, with Marie.

170
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,369
I'll be back before you though.

171
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:39,139
I can't hear you.

172
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:43,078
What? No, nothing.

173
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,073
All right. . .

174
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:49,287
I'll call you tonight, okay.

175
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,750
Nothing. . . I'll call tonight.

176
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:56,946
Beautiful, isn't it?

177
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,526
Yeah, it's beautiful.

178
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:05,452
Nothing like where we're from.

179
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:11,863
Feels strange, suddeny, being here.

180
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:14,797
It's mellow, big-time.

181
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:19,000
I really miss you.

182
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:22,571
I wish you couId live with me.

183
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:25,912
That's up to you.

184
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:30,545
No, it's work, it's life'
it's your boarding school. . .

185
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:49,567
You're beautiful.

186
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:53,544
Don't poke fun.

187
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,673
I'm not. It's what I think.

188
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,218
I needed to speak to him.

189
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,414
Are you bored?

190
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:08,557
Not at all.

191
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,566
The sea is so soothing.

192
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:26,040
The first time I saw it
I was fifteen.

193
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:28,443
It had quite an impact.

194
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:36,116
I wish I'd had a little brother.

195
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,121
Are you an only child?

196
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:44,986
Hey, you're a pair of losers!

197
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:46,891
Losers!

198
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,005
Did I hurt you?

199
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:37,779
I'm sorry. . .

200
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:40,209
Sure you're okay?

201
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,998
You're like kids.

202
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:04,199
Not bad, huh?

203
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:05,870
It's great!

204
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:15,243
I think your room is there.

205
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:26,160
Rather you than me!

206
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:27,858
Taste one.

207
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,660
You're crazy, I'm not eating that.

208
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:37,436
You're such a kid !

209
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,269
- I'll puke.
- How about fries?

210
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,377
There was a first time for them.

211
00:26:42,581 --> 00:26:44,913
I was a baby, I didn't reaIize.

212
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,414
So be an adult.

213
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:47,744
Just try one.

214
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:49,420
Yeah, sure. . .

215
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:50,952
Sorry, he's stupid.

216
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:54,020
I think you're both cute.

217
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,028
I know what makes you uncomfortable.

218
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,624
What?

219
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:06,126
Kindness.

220
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,478
You never wear make-up?

221
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:25,987
No, it always makes me
look so cheap.

222
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:32,325
Let me try. . .

223
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:24,178
I've never met anyone
so alive as you.

224
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:35,659
How can I sleep
with you two giggling?

225
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:37,886
Just concentrate!

226
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:32,249
- They're making fun.
- Not nice.

227
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:35,252
You're a weird pair.

228
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,584
Not weird, different.

229
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,553
- In what way?
- In a lesbian way.

230
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:44,956
You sleep together?

231
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:47,228
You're not lesbians.

232
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:48,894
We are.

233
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:51,467
- Kiss each other then.
- Bullshit!

234
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,364
Go on, kiss her.

235
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:55,699
I don't believe it.

236
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:00,472
We'll do it. Look, we're kissing.

237
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,945
Go on, show us.

238
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:08,415
- Let's go, I've had enough.
- Don't go, lezzies!

239
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:11,917
Hey, you dykes!

240
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:14,157
Don't talk to me like that!

241
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:18,590
What are you waiting for?
Clear off, asshole!

242
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:21,762
That's enough !

243
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,065
- What's going on?
- Don't touch her!

244
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,431
- I'm not touching her.
- Calm down.

245
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:28,732
Behave in the presence of ladies.

246
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,602
Goodnight, ladies.

247
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,355
Can't sleep?

248
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:23,387
Me, neither.

249
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,529
Not feeling well?

250
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:36,038
No, fine. . 
On the contrary, very well.

251
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:42,303
Me, too, very well.

252
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,711
It's funny being here together.

253
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:52,088
I feel like I'm fifteen.

254
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,023
Believe me, you don't look it.

255
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,164
You smoke a Iot for a dancer.

256
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:08,172
Not that much really.

257
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:11,372
I have a rule. . .

258
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,001
I smoke. . .

259
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:17,947
only when. . .

260
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,784
I'm happy.

261
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:33,030
We should get some sIeep.

262
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,700
We can try.

263
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:50,039
Osteopath. . .
That's a masseuse, right?

264
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:54,412
Isn't there a sleep massage?

265
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:59,219
I'll try, if you like.

266
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:36,042
Been up long?

267
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:37,407
A while.

268
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:42,981
Are you stiff?

269
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:44,980
Sorry?

270
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:47,088
From dancing.

271
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:49,620
Oh, right. . .

272
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:52,420
I hurt all over.

273
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:55,327
Tomorrow will be even worse.

274
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:58,067
I guess so. . .

275
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:05,137
- Fancy a nice walk?
- I'm catching the train.

276
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:09,105
Really?

277
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:12,913
It's for the best.

278
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:16,253
- Bad night, huh?
- You should spend. . .

279
00:36:16,454 --> 00:36:18,285
the weekend with your brother.

280
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,592
You think so?

281
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,031
I'm going home.

282
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:31,997
Whatever. . .

283
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:34,632
Morning, girls.

284
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:44,439
See you, then.

285
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:55,951
Honey. . .

286
00:37:56,454 --> 00:37:57,716
You're back.

287
00:37:57,922 --> 00:37:58,889
Were you asleep?

288
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:08,899
A family hug !

289
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:12,269
How was everything?

290
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,428
Tell me about your weekend.

291
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:17,404
Was it good?

292
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,869
You look tired.

293
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:26,812
I got home, did my paperwork. . .
And you?

294
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:32,218
Antonin's costume was useless
compared to mine.

295
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,379
Really?

296
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:35,583
So what did you get up to?

297
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:38,327
Nothing much, walked mostly.

298
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:40,230
I hear she's a bit nuts.

299
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:42,092
- Who?
- Marie.

300
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:46,097
- How do you know that?
- Stuff I heard.

301
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:49,170
- From Frank?
- Frank and the others.

302
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,806
You know, when a girl. . .

303
00:38:52,477 --> 00:38:54,638
is a bit wild. . .

304
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:56,279
And do you know her?

305
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,937
No, sweetheart.

306
00:38:59,517 --> 00:39:01,678
I think I'm falling in love.

307
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,409
It's not true!

308
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:06,255
Who with? Do I know him?

309
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,922
What's he like?

310
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,120
It's a woman.

311
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:17,024
You're kidding. It's not true.

312
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:19,766
It is.

313
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,929
A woman?

314
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,502
That's disgusting.

315
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:28,203
I kissed her.

316
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,443
You kissed her?

317
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:35,846
Is this a joke?

318
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:40,621
I think I'm going into labor!

319
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:45,955
Any cigarettes?

320
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,826
I don't know what it is.

321
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:55,567
It happened all of a sudden.

322
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,302
But it's impossible!

323
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:03,541
The worst thing is,
I wanted her.

324
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:12,254
Do you realize
what you're telling me?

325
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:18,856
It's got to stop there.
You kissed. . .

326
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:20,997
but it must go no further.

327
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:23,230
You're right.

328
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:28,495
It was just a whim.

329
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:30,004
Don't worry.

330
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:32,870
Put that out!

331
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:40,275
It's Marie. . .

332
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:42,912
I just wanted to say hi

333
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:45,622
and to see if you were okay.

334
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:47,918
Love and kisses. . .

335
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:49,950
More love and kisses. . .

336
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,698
I'm sorry. . .

337
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,962
Lie down. . .

338
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:08,605
It's Marie again.
See you Wednesday.

339
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,375
We'll have a girls, night out.
I'm counting on you.

340
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:18,721
''Muffaro was happy.

341
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,291
'' He decided to play a trick
on Lovekins.

342
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:29,495
'' He told him he'd looked everywhere
but couldn't find the little dog. ''

343
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:33,999
Mom, that's the third time
you've read that bit.

344
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:36,266
Really?

345
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:39,476
It's because I'm tired.

346
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:43,245
''As they were in the woods

347
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:46,679
''they climbed a tree
to find a way out.

348
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:51,253
'' Below, a bird smiled
and called to them.

349
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:53,914
''They climbed down towards it. . . ''

350
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:56,651
That's enough.

351
00:41:57,695 --> 00:41:59,322
End of chapter.

352
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,533
Goodnight, honey.

353
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,667
Okay, lights out.

354
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:16,511
Dad, please read some more.
Just one more chapter.

355
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:18,545
Okay, one more page.

356
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,044
Where were you?

357
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:24,817
We were. . . here.

358
00:42:26,791 --> 00:42:29,817
''The bird bit Lovekins on the arm'

359
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:32,724
''but they overpowered it

360
00:42:33,064 --> 00:42:35,157
''and took it back to their camp.

361
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:40,303
''They would either roast it
or eat it raw. . . ''

362
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:42,966
Watch this, it's great.

363
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:50,510
I love this movie.

364
00:42:57,555 --> 00:42:59,887
Jeanne? Are you asleep?

365
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:23,709
You went out like a light.

366
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:26,008
Yes, I know.

367
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:28,674
- How's things?
- Fine and you?

368
00:43:30,254 --> 00:43:31,881
Don't you remember him?

369
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:34,688
From that agency. . .

370
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:35,722
Jean Edouard. . .

371
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:41,231
You shouId come more often.

372
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:43,457
Maybe. . .

373
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:46,262
Work out with us,
it'll do you good.

374
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:51,137
- What will?
- Sports.

375
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:54,904
- But I dance.
- Oh, that's right.

376
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:57,380
Dance is good.

377
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:05,813
I have a class tonight.

378
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,887
I thought it was Saturday mornings.

379
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,655
And Wednesday nights, too.

380
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:13,994
Go ahead.

381
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:17,959
If you think it does you good.

382
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:39,019
Can we get a sitter for Louis?

383
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:42,986
The guys at work are having a drink.

384
00:44:43,361 --> 00:44:46,592
I wasn't going to go
but as you're going out. . .

385
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:57,436
It's like you don't want
to have dinner with me.

386
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:02,444
No, I'm just a little
out of sorts right now.

387
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:09,049
Are you angry about something?

388
00:45:12,823 --> 00:45:14,723
No, not at all.

389
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,155
Roll on the holidays!

390
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:24,720
Great! See you next week!

391
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:28,129
You danced well today.
I'll wait for you.

392
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:45,314
- It was hard today.
- Marie was in a bad mood.

393
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:47,815
Must've been dumped
by her girIfriend.

394
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,828
Shall we go and eat?

395
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,332
Where?

396
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:07,127
Wherever you like.

397
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,140
Where do you want to go?

398
00:47:11,408 --> 00:47:13,103
What if I cook you pasta?

399
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:15,478
At your place?

400
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:19,582
Far to go?

401
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:21,011
Nearly there.

402
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:28,787
You danced well today.

403
00:47:30,194 --> 00:47:31,786
You think so?

404
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:37,160
No answer?

405
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:40,869
I'm happy you came.
It's here.

406
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:50,514
Sorry, I've only just moved in.

407
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:53,375
I'm apartment-sitting for a while.

408
00:47:55,986 --> 00:47:57,954
It's a mess but it's nice.

409
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:03,619
Sit down, I'll boil the water.

410
00:48:39,663 --> 00:48:41,255
It's me.

411
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,894
It was great.

412
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:46,392
No, I didn't lose too much.

413
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:50,267
Well, I'm going to eat at Marie's.

414
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:51,874
How about you?

415
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:54,777
Glad you're having fun.

416
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:57,711
What time will you be home?

417
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:02,677
I'm not sure. I'll see.

418
00:49:03,554 --> 00:49:05,078
Goodbye.

419
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:09,048
Got his permission?

420
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:12,259
I'm not twelve anymore.

421
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:13,760
Cool !

422
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:17,958
Really! I love cool couples.
I'm jealous.

423
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:21,268
When I was young I was jealous.

424
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:24,101
But I'm okay now.

425
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:25,875
You're still young.

426
00:49:27,111 --> 00:49:28,635
I know.

427
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,745
How long you been with David?

428
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:40,320
Eight years.

429
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:42,083
Quite a long time.

430
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:47,153
What's the longest
you were with a guy?

431
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:51,561
Two days.

432
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:55,436
No, just kidding. I don't know. . .

433
00:49:56,573 --> 00:49:58,598
With a girl, two years.

434
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:04,102
With a girl?

435
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:08,752
Are you surprised?

436
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:17,260
I'll check the pasta.

437
00:50:41,552 --> 00:50:43,281
Going already?

438
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:53,052
Is it all right to smoke here?

439
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:56,529
Light one for me.

440
00:51:02,873 --> 00:51:04,465
Are you happy?

441
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:26,819
Do you like pasta?

442
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,064
Kiss me. . .

443
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:52,968
I don't know what to say.

444
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:55,841
Nothing to say.

445
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:08,001
Hi, Marie. She's still asIeep.
She went back to bed.

446
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:10,612
We're late, I'll wake her. . .

447
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,941
Jeanne, wake up.

448
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,520
Call for you.

449
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:20,319
Your darling Marie.

450
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:28,557
I know I shouIdn't call. . .

451
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:32,229
- I miss you.
- Thanks.

452
00:56:32,836 --> 00:56:34,326
That's all.

453
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:36,699
Thanks. Bye.

454
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:51,981
Love, is it?

455
00:56:54,858 --> 00:56:56,689
We just get along well.

456
00:56:58,562 --> 00:57:00,154
What did she want?

457
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:03,422
I Ieft my diary there.

458
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:08,060
You'd better get a move on.

459
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:12,867
I'm off. See you tonight.

460
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:14,766
See you tonight.

461
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:17,341
You'll be late.

462
00:57:17,714 --> 00:57:19,841
I'm already late.

463
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,734
- You're late.
- I came as quick as I could.

464
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:07,393
What's that thing?

465
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:11,291
- You startled me.
- Think you're a singer, do you?

466
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:13,962
It's a gift.

467
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:17,003
And don't poke fun, otherwise. . .

468
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:18,573
I'll cry.

469
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:20,932
That bad, huh?

470
00:58:21,111 --> 00:58:22,806
I don't know what's happening.

471
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,480
You saw the girl again?

472
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:28,012
That's it, I'm a lez.

473
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:30,748
Well that's fantastic!

474
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,421
Have you. . . ?

475
00:58:39,696 --> 00:58:42,324
The lot. For the last three weeks.

476
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:45,262
And?

477
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:49,472
You cannot imagine.

478
00:58:50,307 --> 00:58:53,606
Too right. It's disgusting.
I've got these pictures. . .

479
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:02,043
You must be making this up!

480
00:59:02,619 --> 00:59:04,109
I wish I were.

481
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,188
But I'm not. I told you. . .

482
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:11,451
I'm a dyke.

483
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:16,622
Jesus, I'm pathetic.

484
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:20,496
Not a word to David.
Does he suspect?

485
00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:23,795
I can't stop lying. It's awful.

486
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:27,173
Maybe it's just a phase.

487
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:32,675
I think I love her.

488
00:59:39,322 --> 00:59:42,382
Right, tell me from the beginning.
In detail.

489
00:59:47,564 --> 00:59:49,088
We meet. . .

490
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,539
She's funny.

491
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:05,905
We're close.

492
01:00:11,688 --> 01:00:13,349
She loves me.

493
01:00:13,924 --> 01:00:15,221
I . . .

494
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,049
love. . .

495
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:20,123
you.

496
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:22,959
It's a disaster.

497
01:00:25,302 --> 01:00:27,463
I'm sure it's only phase.

498
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:29,864
You're not stupid.

499
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:34,468
But don't tell David.

500
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:39,806
Aren't you watching?

501
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:45,084
Not interested?

502
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:58,964
Is there a problem?

503
01:00:59,936 --> 01:01:01,927
You've been acting strange.

504
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:04,640
Have I done something?

505
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:09,069
Tell me. . .

506
01:01:09,646 --> 01:01:10,908
What?

507
01:01:13,783 --> 01:01:15,080
What's wrong?

508
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:25,689
Tell me.

509
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:30,527
It's nothing. . .

510
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:34,368
I'm tired. . . I can't relax.

511
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,975
Let me give you a hug.

512
01:01:53,456 --> 01:01:55,356
You're not yourself right now.

513
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:21,677
'' I'm in love with Marie. ''

514
01:02:23,153 --> 01:02:24,677
Is that it?

515
01:02:25,188 --> 01:02:26,746
She feels the same.

516
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:30,917
Do you realize she's a girl?

517
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:36,759
Have you. . . ?

518
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:40,597
Great!

519
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,761
This gets better and better!

520
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:49,401
Give me a cigarette.

521
01:03:04,594 --> 01:03:07,119
In love? What does that mean?

522
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:09,287
Like, you love her?

523
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:13,634
Answer me!

524
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:16,296
Yes. . . I don't know.

525
01:03:18,141 --> 01:03:21,372
You've only just met her.
This is impossible!

526
01:03:21,578 --> 01:03:23,705
Do you know what you're saying?

527
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,744
How am I meant to take this?

528
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:30,252
I don't know.

529
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:33,422
- I'm fed up with lying.
- Lying?

530
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:34,954
Are you kidding?

531
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:38,761
You're saying you're a dyke.
You couId have told me

532
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:42,329
before marrying me!
Isn't that lying?

533
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:54,306
What? Are you ashamed?

534
01:03:54,978 --> 01:03:57,003
You're in deep shit.

535
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:59,477
- I'm not ashamed.
- You're not?

536
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:02,751
That girl is nothing. She's trash !

537
01:04:02,986 --> 01:04:04,317
She's trash !

538
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,781
Jesuss she's a woman !

539
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:13,928
I know.

540
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:20,766
What are you gonna do?

541
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:24,933
I don't know.

542
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:30,272
And we're through?

543
01:04:35,018 --> 01:04:36,280
I don't know.

544
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:38,044
I'm going out.

545
01:04:40,223 --> 01:04:41,656
Enough already.

546
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,835
Don't worry. . .

547
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:02,802
There's nothing to say.

548
01:05:03,146 --> 01:05:05,706
I understand everything.

549
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,583
I'll do anything you want.
Everything.

550
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:14,850
I'm with you. I'm not afraid.

551
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:19,924
I won't ask for anything.
Just a little of you.

552
01:05:21,397 --> 01:05:23,763
What you like, when you like. . .

553
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:45,611
For reaI.

554
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:55,421
Where's dad?

555
01:05:57,567 --> 01:05:59,432
He got up early, honey.

556
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,031
To go to work?

557
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,767
Why aren't you dressed?

558
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,804
Eat.

559
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:21,282
Can we play Scrabble tonight?

560
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:23,756
Huh?

561
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:26,622
We'll see. . . Eat.

562
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,616
Being a lesbian is one thing. . .

563
01:06:55,825 --> 01:06:58,123
It's understandable with your past.

564
01:06:58,628 --> 01:07:00,152
But you've gone too far.

565
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,456
Don't touch me!

566
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,427
Leave Jeanne alone.

567
01:07:04,334 --> 01:07:05,995
She's not for you.

568
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:08,167
One, she's not from your world.

569
01:07:08,504 --> 01:07:09,664
Two, she's married.

570
01:07:10,006 --> 01:07:11,997
Three, she has a child.

571
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,267
And she doesn't love David.

572
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:16,638
Leave her alone, do you hear?

573
01:07:18,948 --> 01:07:20,609
You've had your fun.

574
01:07:22,618 --> 01:07:24,950
Now it's getting heavy.

575
01:07:25,154 --> 01:07:26,849
David was gonna come.

576
01:07:27,857 --> 01:07:30,052
He can go too far.
It's for your own good.

577
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:31,851
Let him come.

578
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,528
Lucky for you I stopped him.

579
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:41,668
You're family.
Don't get mixed up with this.

580
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:45,530
Problem is, I love her.

581
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:49,711
You're in shit.

582
01:07:51,748 --> 01:07:52,680
Do you realize?

583
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:54,816
- Is that it?
- For today.

584
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:57,077
- Don't threaten me, Frank.
- I'm not.

585
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,844
I'm not threatening you.

586
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:00,989
I'm warning you, leave her.

587
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:03,518
Leave her!

588
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:15,934
I'd prefer to walk.

589
01:08:25,782 --> 01:08:27,181
What's the time?

590
01:08:27,683 --> 01:08:29,048
5. 30.

591
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:33,379
I'm not picking up Louis
and I'm not sleeping at home.

592
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:34,747
Where then?

593
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:36,956
At Frank's.

594
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:39,927
Look. . .

595
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:42,925
I know things are going badly.

596
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:45,794
If you're getting back at me. . .

597
01:08:45,968 --> 01:08:48,129
- No, it's not that.
- Let me finish.

598
01:08:50,206 --> 01:08:52,572
I can't wait forever.

599
01:08:53,576 --> 01:08:55,635
Think about it, you're a big girl.

600
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:57,879
I can still forgive you.

601
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:04,283
But if this lesbian thing
is bullshit

602
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:08,446
and you just don't want me,
then say.

603
01:09:09,725 --> 01:09:11,886
If you don't love me, say.

604
01:09:14,764 --> 01:09:16,595
Or there'll be consequences.

605
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:20,058
There will be for Louis's sake.

606
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:38,183
Good day at school?

607
01:09:42,792 --> 01:09:44,953
Can we play Monopoly tonight?

608
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:46,685
I don't know, we'll see.

609
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:49,859
Why don't you know?

610
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,761
Daddy's gone away for a few days.

611
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:55,164
Why didn't he take me?

612
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:57,633
He'll take you next time.

613
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:01,970
Was it a good day today?

614
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:03,473
What did you do?

615
01:10:03,646 --> 01:10:08,549
Let's see. . . Geography, geometry. . .

616
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:11,718
French and. . .

617
01:10:12,722 --> 01:10:16,522
Oh, that's right, drawing.

618
01:10:16,826 --> 01:10:19,192
Drawing? Was it good?

619
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,592
Not good, huh?

620
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:49,277
Do you want to stop seeing me?

621
01:12:54,517 --> 01:12:56,144
As you like.

622
01:13:01,624 --> 01:13:03,319
It's sad.

623
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,890
Sad but predictable.

624
01:13:18,207 --> 01:13:20,471
I'd rather you left quickly.

625
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:24,470
Is that you?

626
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:31,644
Are you sure?

627
01:14:32,448 --> 01:14:34,075
You thought it over?

628
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:40,145
I'll call you later.

629
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,951
Well?

630
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:44,249
Fine.

631
01:14:44,794 --> 01:14:46,728
Jesus, I was scared.

632
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:49,094
Me, too.

633
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,117
What a face!

634
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,155
- It's over.
- David?

635
01:15:23,465 --> 01:15:25,126
The girl, Marie.

636
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:27,259
What a relief.

637
01:15:29,605 --> 01:15:31,129
Oh, damn. . .

638
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:34,139
Are you sad?

639
01:15:38,347 --> 01:15:40,212
Oh,,sweetie. . .

640
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,215
When did you leave her?

641
01:15:45,955 --> 01:15:47,149
Two weeks ago.

642
01:15:48,157 --> 01:15:50,057
Have you seen her since?

643
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:54,155
The worst is over.

644
01:15:55,397 --> 01:15:56,864
I feel so bad.

645
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,997
You did what you had to.

646
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:07,005
You couIdn't leave your guy
for a girl !

647
01:16:08,644 --> 01:16:11,010
You're not a real lesbian.

648
01:16:16,886 --> 01:16:20,219
I said I wouIdn't call.
But I am.

649
01:16:22,157 --> 01:16:23,749
I hope you're okay.

650
01:16:32,368 --> 01:16:33,596
I'm sorry.

651
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,626
When I grow up I want to be a bird.

652
01:17:11,307 --> 01:17:13,070
You're no fun.

653
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:28,952
You're no fun at all lately.

654
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:34,458
I know I'm no fun, honey. . .

655
01:17:35,664 --> 01:17:36,892
but I do love you.

656
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:38,624
I love you, too.

657
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:04,646
Don't move, I'll be back.

658
01:19:11,393 --> 01:19:12,758
Is this better?

659
01:19:13,762 --> 01:19:15,593
Is this what you want?

660
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:17,695
You asshole.

661
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:24,596
Is this what turns you on?

662
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:30,768
Is this what you want?

663
01:19:33,849 --> 01:19:36,374
Is this what you like? Look. . .

664
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:39,443
What's wrong?

665
01:19:40,856 --> 01:19:42,756
Is this in bad taste?

666
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,250
Am I the asshole?

667
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:49,689
Is it good for your son
that his mom loves a dyke?

668
01:19:50,766 --> 01:19:53,291
Never! Do you hear me?

669
01:19:53,469 --> 01:19:55,733
You won't bring him up with a dyke!

670
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:57,437
Look at me!

671
01:19:58,107 --> 01:19:59,039
Look at me!

672
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:01,098
- Stop!
- You bitch !

673
01:20:03,112 --> 01:20:05,478
Don't worry, I won't hit you.

674
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,625
In to bed. . .

675
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,324
My darling. . .

676
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:53,213
I'll work everything out.

677
01:22:53,548 --> 01:22:54,947
For everyone.

678
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:56,815
For Louis?

679
01:22:58,086 --> 01:23:00,646
If I'm unhappy, Louis will be too.

680
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:04,487
- You got divorced.
- But not over a woman.

681
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:06,827
- What does it change?
- Everything.

682
01:23:08,497 --> 01:23:10,897
I'll make sure nothing changes.

683
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,228
Anyway, say nothing to him.
That's up to me.

684
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:17,398
Come, Louis.

685
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:20,931
Come here, honey.

686
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:25,275
Now do as grandma says.

687
01:23:25,447 --> 01:23:29,577
Don't stay up too late
and take your medicine, okay.

688
01:23:30,452 --> 01:23:31,783
Give me a kiss.

689
01:23:32,287 --> 01:23:33,686
Bye, Mom.

690
01:23:33,922 --> 01:23:36,083
And try not to fight with dad.

691
01:23:54,009 --> 01:23:57,536
For personal reasons,
I must cancel my appointments.

692
01:23:57,879 --> 01:24:02,213
I'm very sorry. The practice
will open as usual on Monday.

693
01:24:06,121 --> 01:24:09,181
I'd like to speak
to Mr Bregniaud, my Iawyer.

694
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:12,988
Can you have him call me?
It's urgent.

695
01:24:13,462 --> 01:24:17,193
Yes, Jeanne Mazzotti. . .
Thank you, goodbye.

696
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:50,331
Hi !

697
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:53,666
- She's not in?
- No idea where she is.

698
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:56,894
I'll come back later.

699
01:24:57,072 --> 01:24:58,505
No, come in.

700
01:25:27,602 --> 01:25:29,126
I'm sorry. . .

701
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:32,399
I'm not usually such a wreck.

702
01:25:32,908 --> 01:25:35,570
Don't worry, I know all about grief.

703
01:25:59,468 --> 01:26:01,129
Do you want a drink?

704
01:27:51,379 --> 01:27:52,437
Come. . .

705
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:04,258
I missed you.

706
01:28:10,465 --> 01:28:11,625
I miss you.

707
01:28:18,073 --> 01:28:19,700
I miss you.

708
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:31,552
You'll stay with me?

709
01:28:34,389 --> 01:28:35,822
For real?

710
01:28:41,796 --> 01:28:43,661
You've thought about it?

711
01:28:44,899 --> 01:28:47,060
You know what to expect?

712
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:58,605
Sweet Jesus, Virgin Mary,
you answered my prayer.

713
01:29:07,922 --> 01:29:09,856
Where's your son?

714
01:29:11,126 --> 01:29:12,787
At my mother's.

715
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:18,459
We'll sort everything out.

716
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,327
He'll be happy. . . And so will you.

717
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:28,203
I'm strong. You better believe it.

718
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:33,144
Very strong.

719
01:29:38,553 --> 01:29:40,180
I love you. . .

720
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,488
Shall I cook enough for three
or am I eating alone?
