1
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,034
I was in a forest.

2
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,559
I couldn't find my way.

3
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,913
I was hopelessly lost.

4
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,840
It kept getting darker.

5
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,553
I started to panic.

6
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,079
I thought,
I'll never find my way again.

7
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,271
UNDER THE RAINBOW

8
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,231
And then... I see a man,

9
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,350
stock still,

10
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,120
looking at me,
with so much kindness.

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,278
He reaches out,
and I go to him, without thinking.

12
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,835
And someone is behind him.
Like an angel.

13
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,553
He <i>is</i> an angel.

14
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,399
Pointing at him.

15
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,873
He carries me up and away.

16
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,036
Wait, the angel carries you?

17
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,750
No, the man.

18
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,837
Then he and I are flying.

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,553
On a horse, but a weird one,
with a bird's head.

20
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,796
A hippogriff.

21
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,356
A horse with a bird's head.

22
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,233
It's called a hippogriff.

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,034
So we're flying,

24
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,672
flying over the countryside.

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,713
And suddenly I felt great.
I was confident.

26
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,793
All my fear was gone.

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,798
And we fly over my home,

28
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,373
and I see my dad as tiny.

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,775
Really tiny!

30
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,932
Waving his arms, yelling to me.

31
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,574
Not that way!

32
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,930
Not that way!

33
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,940
"Not that way!"

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,679
Stop that, Lauranie!

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,075
Give me those...

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,438
...wands.
This is not a game.

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,758
Look! Now it's broken.
It won't work anymore!

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,476
And the flowers, the pumpkins!
I'm not picking them up!

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,917
Mathieu, Lulu! You hear me?

40
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,854
Nina is so absorbed.

41
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,495
Stock still,
totally into her book.

42
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,213
Yeah, it's the Bible.

43
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,214
- The Bible?
- Yes.

44
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,809
Every chance she gets,
she reads the Bible.

45
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,536
- Your dream?
- That's all I remember.

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,810
It's idiotic, but I was thinking...

47
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,778
there's a chance
it will never happen to me.

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,916
What?

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,553
I woke up and I thought,

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,433
I've never really felt that.

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,870
I've never been carried away
like that.

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,478
I've never really loved. I...

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,831
never really loved someone.

54
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,633
It got me so depressed.

55
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,273
Come on,
you're so young, you have time!

56
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,352
Nothing but bad luck lately.

57
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,039
Yeah, what can you do?

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,160
I had the 4 and the 11.

59
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,351
4th time in a row I had 2.

60
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,112
That's the trifecta.
You need 3, that's the whole point.

61
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,271
Anyway,
there are more dire things.

62
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,110
Right.

63
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,037
- My condolences, Pierre.
- Thank you.

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,476
You hadn't seen your dad
in how long?

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,160
I was just wondering that,
last night.

66
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,430
I don't know...

67
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,840
2 or 3 months, I guess.

68
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,993
I feel nothing.

69
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,794
I hadn't seen him in ages,
but it affects me.

70
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,197
Affects you.
Because you decided it would.

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,039
My father was nothing to you.

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,756
He was not nothing to me.
What does that mean?

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,955
Don't exaggerate.

74
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,355
He's your dad.
He was always there for Sandro.

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,517
And he was very shaken.

76
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,730
Where is Sandro?

77
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,717
Did you ask him about the deposit?

78
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,199
I didn't get a chance.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,753
We buried someone. You notice?

80
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,075
What deposit?

81
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,156
Well...

82
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,399
I either live at Mum's till I'm 50,
or rent a place.

83
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,670
Pierre!

84
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,311
Oh, I loved your father so!

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,272
- Be strong, OK?
- Yeah.

86
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,153
You can still talk to him.

87
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,273
He hears you.

88
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,392
- You'll talk to him?
- Sure.

89
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,637
In any case, you'll see him soon.

90
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,020
- You must speak to him.
- Yes, I will.

91
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,575
That's good.

92
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,455
Madame Irma. She still exists?

93
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,450
Apparently.

94
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,136
And still sick.

95
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,219
You remember the date?

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,620
Date?

97
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,220
Of your death, remember?

98
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,535
Come on!

99
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,615
How should I remember that crap?

100
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,015
Date of your death?

101
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,733
No, it's horseshit.

102
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,580
A crazy lady
who used to do everyone's horoscope.

103
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,054
It's nonsense.

104
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,458
So... when is it?

105
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,734
I said I can't recall.

106
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,091
I can. It made an impression on me.

107
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,610
Not that I believe it.
Sure, it's horseshit but...

108
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,094
it makes an impression.

109
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,174
There they are, I'm off.

110
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,694
You're off?
Aren't you coming to Odette's?

111
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,413
Certainly not.

112
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,135
Come by the office,
talk about the deposit?

113
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,974
- Your girlfriend has kids?
- As you can see.

114
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,100
Can't be fun for you.

115
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,449
No, it isn't.

116
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,094
I'm parked at the corner.

117
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,216
Pull it up!

118
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,815
Pull the handle up,
the thingy will fall.

119
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,176
This is great.

120
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,691
Enough room for a vegetable garden.

121
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,259
You said a tiny garden.
It's not so tiny.

122
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,293
No, don't drink the water!

123
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,613
It's supposedly drinkable, but...

124
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,858
Which reminds me,
Eric said he might stop by.

125
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,257
Tell him the water's back,
but it's brown.

126
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,133
Nina, I'm leaving!

127
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,209
That's my mum, I'm not taking it.

128
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,979
Did her operation go well?

129
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,217
Hands aren't easy, I'm told.

130
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,820
That's her again.

131
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,455
If I answer,
we'll just argue as usual.

132
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,530
Nina!

133
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,619
She won't say goodbye.
The Red Sea must be parting.

134
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,616
You free Saturday?

135
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,820
Not Saturday.
That's the Princes' Ball.

136
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,580
- You never showed me your dress.
- Right!

137
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,259
Actually, there are two.

138
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,372
I loved them, so I got both.

139
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,296
I don't really want to go.

140
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,810
Why?

141
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,978
Your dream might be an omen.
You could meet someone.

142
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,296
That's exactly
what Mrs Bérard said.

143
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,539
Is she your fortune teller?

144
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,538
Well, she's a radiesthesist.

145
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,854
Hello, Ma'am.
A survey on the fears of the French.

146
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,380
No, thanks!

147
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,460
Hello. A survey...

148
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,470
The crisis.

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,398
This is a time of crisis.

150
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,034
Terrorism.

151
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,949
Unemployment.

152
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,636
Poverty, disease.

153
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,514
Like I said, the climate.

154
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,040
It's all mixed up.

155
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,153
Winter in summer,
summer in winter.

156
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,880
Summer in winter.

157
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,195
Well, thanks.

158
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,640
You're welcome.

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,854
I'm not working enough.

160
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,619
I have to work on the recital!
My goddamn father!

161
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,538
What's he got to do with it?

162
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,290
Here I am doing stupid surveys.
Will he lift a finger?

163
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,396
He runs a driving school.
Is he rich?

164
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,034
No, but...

165
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,756
My grandfather just died.
Left him money, he could help.

166
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,315
Every single time,
I have to beg him.

167
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,458
For the deposit,
I have to get on my knees.

168
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,452
The grandfather you liked?

169
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,310
Going to the party?

170
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,510
What party?

171
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,871
The princes' ball, on Saturday.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,992
I have a quintet rehearsal.

173
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,634
Shit, you're rehearsing.

174
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,160
Why? You're going?

175
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,572
Well I don't know...

176
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,734
I won't know anyone.

177
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,659
Julien's brothers got comps.

178
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,420
Frankly,
I don't feel like going but...

179
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,816
Without you...

180
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,774
They might finish early.
I could meet you there.

181
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,632
I was sure you were going.

182
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,351
I'll try to skip a movement.

183
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,215
Could totally suck.

184
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,094
It could always totally suck.
Why do anything?

185
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,654
Just come and see.

186
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,658
- Got to go!
- Later!

187
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,490
You know them, it's your milieu.
I don't.

188
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,100
I'll feel like an idiot.

189
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,496
My milieu? Don't go overboard.

190
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,213
You're not from the jungle.

191
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,333
And you have to dress.
I don't own a suit.

192
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,534
You don't need one.
Got a black jacket?

193
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,698
Anyway, on Saturdays
I have to pick up my mum.

194
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,176
Pick up your mum?

195
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,815
She works Saturday nights.
I drive her home.

196
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,130
She's afraid she'll get mugged.

197
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,094
So at midnight, in any case,
I'll have to split.

198
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,374
Where's your dad?

199
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,456
He's in the cemetery.

200
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,333
When does he go to heaven?

201
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,655
Heaven? No.

202
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,296
No, he'll stay in the cemetery...

203
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,460
- Morgane, eat your carrots.
- I'm eating them!

204
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,139
Are you going to die?

205
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,855
Sure, one day. We all die.

206
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,414
So when do you die?

207
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,815
I have no idea.

208
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,090
Enough, Johanna.

209
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,495
Doesn't bother me.

210
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,692
Stop, you'll break your glass!

211
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,459
Eat your vegetables.

212
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,650
I'm eating them!

213
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,851
Will you go to heaven when you die?

214
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,972
You don't go to heaven when...

215
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,013
You stay in a sort of...

216
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,239
Like... Like in a box.

217
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,872
Can't hear myself talk!

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,640
- Got any olive oil?
- On the right.

219
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,878
It's not the body.
The spirit goes to heaven.

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,231
And there you meet
everyone you knew.

221
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,114
People think you go to heaven,
because they need

222
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,879
to believe in an afterlife.

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,990
But no.

224
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,636
You turn into a skeleton.
You've seen those before, right?

225
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,991
The skin goes and the bones remain.

226
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,476
Personally, I think we go to heaven.

227
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,150
The truth is, no one knows.
You do as you see fit.

228
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,397
Put that glass down!

229
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,872
No way I drink that water!

230
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,799
Or even wash with it.
Washing with brown water!

231
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,673
It's not dirty, it's rust.

232
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,837
I don't wash with rust.

233
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,076
It won't last.

234
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,558
There you go. It works.

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,957
For more heat, press here.

236
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,150
Minus, plus.

237
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,517
This button. Minus, plus.

238
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,156
Got it?

239
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,957
If it turns off... It won't.

240
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,232
But if it does,
press here, with the flame.

241
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,033
I'll never remember.

242
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,150
Fine.

243
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,676
Well, I'll say goodbye to Nina.

244
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,180
Yeah, I remember.

245
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,257
He's the first one who...

246
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,170
Isn't John the Baptist
from Jesus' family?

247
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,850
No! Jesus has no family.
Even his parents aren't his parents.

248
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,096
Oh I see.

249
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,778
- Know what "Jesus" means?
- Tell me Tuesday.

250
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,539
It means "saviour".

251
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,778
She keeps scratching. Notice?

252
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,574
She never stops.

253
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,532
Then sometimes not at all.

254
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,779
It's very psychosomatic.

255
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,316
Right. Everything is psychosomatic.

256
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,318
Well everything is!

257
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,478
I didn't say it,
the dermatologist did.

258
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,554
I don't get it. I clicked OK.

259
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
And it says to enter my code again.

260
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,455
Enter it.

261
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,335
All right.

262
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,135
I enter it...

263
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,331
And it says "incorrect code".

264
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,214
I don't know.
Maybe you spelled it wrong.

265
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,412
Wait, I know.
It might be another one.

266
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,372
What? You have several codes?

267
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,014
Sure! I have a code for...

268
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,894
Why? Use one code!
I only have one code.

269
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,171
Shit, that one didn't work either!

270
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,694
Take a look?
I know there's a way to...

271
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,220
Why don't you look?

272
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,539
For once, pick up a manual.
Say, "I can do this. I'm no dummy."

273
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,299
Objects don't hate me!

274
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,890
Like an old lady!

275
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,218
Want to end up like my mum,
who can only push on or off?

276
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,536
Is that your technological aim?

277
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,740
Seriously, Marianne!

278
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,977
Fine. I asked because you were here!

279
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,456
Finding your new man's email
is no fun.

280
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,811
He was never my man.
And I no longer see him!

281
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,978
But fine, no problem.
I'll figure it out.

282
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,149
It's no joke.

283
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,632
She really wants a first communion.

284
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,712
Nina!
She wants a first communion.

285
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,197
You quit med school.
What did Dad say?

286
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,913
Not a word...

287
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,996
What's your point?

288
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,555
He was disappointed but he let you.

289
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,718
This is the same.
It's fine for her to do this.

290
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,993
It will give her time to find
what she really wants to do.

291
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,840
Don't answer for her.
I'm talking to Laura.

292
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,051
That's right. A gap year.

293
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,456
And that was your own idea?

294
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,650
Sure.

295
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,091
Incredible. You don't like
what she does, you look at me.

296
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,291
Your daughter keeps scratching.

297
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,732
"The Casseul Empire Shaken."

298
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,214
Listen, no.

299
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,094
Don't bother. Thanks.
Talk to you later.

300
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,800
What was that?

301
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,400
Pain in my ass!

302
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,551
Thierry.
Any article that skewers me,

303
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,558
he just has to read it to me.

304
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,796
Enough!

305
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,812
It's been 2 weeks! I know about it.

306
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,536
They're sick. "An Empire Shaken"!

307
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,413
They have no right!

308
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,896
They can't just print that bull!

309
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,093
Don't worry, darling.

310
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,414
I am worried.

311
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,233
About time! I called twice!

312
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,556
Don't yell at me! I hurried.

313
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,080
My phone's off.

314
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,714
What good is a cell phone?

315
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,433
Get on. I have to get back.

316
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,873
I ask you to pick me up once,
it's like pulling teeth!

317
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,036
Where's your shoe?

318
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,038
Strap your helmet. I got a party!

319
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,439
Is it a shoeless party?
Why are you missing a shoe?

320
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,691
<i>The Casseul Inc. empire is shaken.</i>

321
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,018
<i>The CEO, Vincent Casseul,
and 4 executives,</i>

322
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,938
<i>accused of massive toxic...</i>

323
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,979
Pierre? What's the matter?

324
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,535
I just got in. Everything all right?

325
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,810
Go ahead.

326
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,179
Oh, that's why.

327
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,611
So you're actually interested.

328
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,759
You don't believe in that.
You're reason incarnate.

329
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,195
If you can't remember, I won't say.

330
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,832
March 14th.

331
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,037
This one. This year.

332
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,014
Oh I see.

333
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,371
No. Just asking.
I wanted to know.

334
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,177
Had a little trouble sleeping.

335
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,518
You don't have to tell me that.

336
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,149
Of course!

337
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,795
Of course it's horseshit.
I'm just curious.

338
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,674
You reminded me of it
at the cemetery and...

339
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,555
So I'm feeling a little guilty
about Sandro.

340
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,320
I'm thinking he must be waiting,
all alone.

341
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,354
Then, I see him dancing
with this incredible girl.

342
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,075
And from then on,
hypnotised, under her spell.

343
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,953
She approached me.

344
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,955
I didn't get it.

345
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,309
She liked you.

346
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,999
These things happen.

347
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,270
Can we start?

348
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,313
In any case,
I don't even have her number.

349
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,909
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

350
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,599
You're weird.

351
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,336
Can we start?

352
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,693
There, great.

353
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,974
No! Don't cover his butt,
cover his face!

354
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,830
Now...

355
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,999
Hang on. A little over...

356
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,270
There. Good.

357
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,437
My wand. Or this won't work.

358
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,230
No, not now.

359
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,879
Not too noisy?

360
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,754
I gave them 5 minutes.

361
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,916
No, it's fine.

362
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,311
Joanna wants you to say good night.

363
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,116
Really?

364
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,599
- Yeah.
- Oh my.

365
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,110
What?

366
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,996
No, I...

367
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,834
I don't know how.

368
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,960
To say good night?

369
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,640
It's uncomfortable. What do I say?

370
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,558
- Are you kidding?
- No.

371
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,793
You kiss her, say "Good night."

372
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,470
Well...

373
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,090
All right.

374
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,413
Maybe it was a bad idea
to come here with the kids.

375
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,496
Why?

376
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,815
We put you out.

377
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,500
Not at all.
It's not like that.

378
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,390
It's fine.

379
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,560
No, we're putting you out.
You were alone, 3 of us move in.

380
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,592
Eléonore, I said it's fine.

381
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,680
Come on. I can take it.

382
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,554
I can adjust
for 3 or 4 months, without...

383
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,832
Three months, barely.
I move in on March 14th.

384
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,120
March 14th?

385
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,435
That's right.

386
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,677
- How about that?
- What?

387
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,035
Well it's...

388
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,719
That's very precise.

389
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,557
That's the date on the lease.

390
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,269
Hopefully, it'll be ready on time.

391
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,130
I'm exhausted.

392
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,974
I wanted to kill Morgane tonight.
So annoying!

393
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,609
So is Joanna, in her own way.

394
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,969
They're kids. Kids are annoying.

395
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,718
They demand attention,
every second. It fries your brain.

396
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,471
You repeat yourself over and over.

397
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,877
It's animal training. Awful.
That's undeniable.

398
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,020
I mean, when you look at it head on.

399
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,013
Head on, that's how it is.

400
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,336
No, Laura. Don't confuse things.

401
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,339
I do argue with your dad,
we have differing views.

402
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,450
But I'm sure.

403
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,414
I know he's incapable
of doing such a thing.

404
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,596
Polluting,
knowingly and voluntarily.

405
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,915
No, it's nonsense.

406
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,317
The lady I see told me,
"Ordeals await you."

407
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,794
Your fortune teller?

408
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,389
Not a fortune teller,
a radiesthesist.

409
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,830
I swear,
everything she said is true.

410
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,110
Yeah? Like what?

411
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,675
That ordeals awaited me.

412
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,959
That I was too sensitive.

413
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,512
I had a burning need to be loved.

414
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,379
That I lacked confidence.

415
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,852
And that I'd meet
the man of my dreams.

416
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,098
Why don't you ask her
where your musician is?

417
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,654
She's not a dowser.

418
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,499
I know one who is.

419
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,895
You do?

420
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,456
Nina?

421
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,932
It's your father. Come down!

422
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,254
Now you tell me.

423
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,700
- Couldn't you warn me?
- They just called.

424
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,739
I can't turn work down.

425
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,496
What is it?

426
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,055
Voice work.
For a shampoo.

427
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,330
Eco-friendly.

428
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,791
So I'd keep her till Thursday night?

429
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,714
Fine, what else can I say?

430
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,472
The blue tube is... in any case.

431
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,037
The yellow one
is if it itches really, really bad.

432
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,395
Oh and...

433
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,474
I said no, but...

434
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,236
if she has a fit,
she sleeps with that.

435
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,431
This is getting hard to take.

436
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,794
OK, bye.

437
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,274
Bye, and thanks.

438
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,257
I have to concentrate
full time on my music,

439
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,939
if I want to make it.

440
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,570
You, instead of a bank,
you go see your dad.

441
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,340
Mum told me...

442
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,537
that Grandpa left you something.

443
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,816
Here, this is for the deposit.

444
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,932
About the rest, I'll think it over.

445
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,893
Got a minute for...?

446
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,894
Excuse me. Do you have a minute...?

447
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,454
Excuse me...

448
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,054
TWO MONTHS LATER...

449
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,196
"It's easier to split an atom

450
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,800
"than a prejudice."

451
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,798
According to Einstein.

452
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,437
I would also agree with him

453
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,835
that a rumour

454
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,600
is harder to combat

455
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,949
than an entire army.

456
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,034
Relax, he'll be here.

457
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,356
His rehearsal was over at 4:30.

458
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,914
He should be here.

459
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,156
He'll be here.

460
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,840
That's enough talk.

461
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,794
Now it's time to get down
to serious matters.

462
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,249
Bravo, daddykins.

463
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,613
Where the hell is Sandro?

464
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,971
He's working, constantly.

465
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,693
His audition is coming up.

466
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,140
Plus those surveys.

467
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,878
Why not give him money?

468
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,150
Out of principle?

469
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,595
Yes, principle.

470
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,115
Why are we here?
"So the parents can meet."

471
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,674
Isn't that 19th-century?

472
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,554
Not just the 19th century.
Nowadays, too.

473
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,037
They met a month ago.
The parents have to meet already?

474
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,790
It's been two months.
And this is the occasion.

475
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,480
Don't start, Pierre.
I'm begging you.

476
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,878
I think it's fun.
I never saw a Legion of Honour.

477
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,896
Didn't quote me once in your speech.

478
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,613
What should I have said?

479
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,099
Let me congratulate you.

480
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,973
I'm very happy for you.

481
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,534
You might have said...

482
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,177
"I congratulate my sister.

483
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,172
"An actress unjustly ignored,

484
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,372
"she brings my life
all the humanity it needs."

485
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,775
Oh, Mr Alexis!

486
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,929
Seen my bracelet?

487
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,291
Yes. Really pretty.

488
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,374
He can't afford better.

489
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,493
Which I like.
He's so real-life, it's refreshing.

490
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,260
He struggles all day,
thinks only about music.

491
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,970
He was cute...

492
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,615
Do you have any drinkable red wine?

493
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,091
Then go and see!
Wait.

494
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,940
Want to order?

495
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,017
Hello. I'm fine, thanks.

496
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,575
Sandro, my dad. Dad, Sandro.

497
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,895
Pleasure.

498
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,059
I thought he was a waiter.

499
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,574
Hello, sir.

500
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,696
How are you?

501
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,573
Did your parents come with you?

502
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,456
No, I'll go get them.

503
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,956
Does he stutter, or am I...

504
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,400
I knew you'd say that.

505
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,079
He does? I didn't notice.

506
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,190
Marianne!

507
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,773
What are you doing?

508
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,131
Getting bored silly. Why?

509
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,179
Mum, come on.
We're over here with Laura and...

510
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,915
You have a license.

511
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,952
I have the license, but...

512
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,517
I haven't driven in so long.
I need to regain confidence.

513
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,233
I've moved out of town.

514
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,238
You see?
Now I absolutely have to...

515
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,873
I have a car I don't use.

516
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,834
It's parked outside, I don't use it.
Seriously.

517
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,155
Rules of the road?

518
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,680
Basically, I know them.

519
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,759
No, not basically.
The rules are important.

520
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,574
Anyway, if you want
I could give you lessons.

521
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,170
Nice of you.

522
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,679
Rehearsal go OK?

523
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,234
Yeah, fine. Fine.

524
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,440
But I missed you.

525
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,119
So did I.

526
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,436
I didn't hear a word my dad said.

527
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,915
Your mother is so young.

528
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,269
Not that young.

529
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,314
I have to get back.

530
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,333
It's funny.
He wet the bed until the age of 15.

531
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,611
A lot of people told me that...

532
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,780
that and stuttering
often go together.

533
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,019
But why? I mean...

534
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,777
It happens
to converted left-handers.

535
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,254
But he's a righty! So...

536
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,815
No one knows.

537
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,733
Or some childhood trauma,
they say that often.

538
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,754
As far as I know, frankly,
he wasn't particularly traumatised.

539
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,997
However you bring them up is wrong.

540
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,352
Excuse me,
I must tell my husband something.

541
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,949
I turn around and I see Sandro,
staring back

542
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,497
with an angel pointing him out.

543
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,818
Because there was this statue
behind him, a finger

544
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,090
pointing at him.

545
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,573
The fortune teller said that?

546
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,453
No, it was my dream.

547
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,890
I see,
but the fortune teller said it.

548
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,532
She's not a fortune teller,
but yes she said it.

549
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,134
You remember
I didn't want to go to that party.

550
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,092
I remember. Do you?

551
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,895
Girl's totally nuts.

552
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,979
Come on...
But how old is her mother?

553
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,170
That's her mother?

554
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,940
You're the fairest of them all.
As usual.

555
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,573
Don't bother.
My father believes in nothing.

556
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,169
This is verified. They're facts.

557
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,815
Facts... They're coincidences.

558
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,260
Anyway, anyway...

559
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,372
what we wanted to say is...

560
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,349
we're getting engaged on...

561
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,114
March 14th.

562
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,969
We had said the 13th,
but it was a Friday.

563
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,054
I was wondering,

564
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,058
is there some medicine...?

565
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,620
No connection.

566
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,931
But since I have these thoughts
that keep coming back,

567
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,655
I thought maybe
there's some drug to...

568
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,152
get rid of them, stop them.

569
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,640
What kind of thoughts?

570
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,199
Not the thoughts themselves.

571
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,597
It's how they keep coming back,
all the time.

572
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,636
Listen,
I can't help, I'm a podiatrist.

573
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,117
But I know a good therapist.
Want his address?

574
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,593
No, I was just asking.

575
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,896
No, I'm fine.

576
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,890
It's just...

577
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,298
I'm a little tense right now.
That can't help.

578
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,933
I got people at the house.

579
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,850
Tiresome...

580
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,333
Yes. Getting back to your feet,
the soles.

581
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,370
Wear them every day,
or the pain returns.

582
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,254
Isn't love beautiful?

583
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,894
I'm not objective.

584
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,136
Meaning?

585
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,416
Really?

586
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,330
I get it.

587
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,619
I didn't know.

588
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,138
I meant it ironically.

589
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,217
I don't think love is so great.

590
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,856
Some detail you get attached to,
fabricating a myth.

591
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,056
- Don't you agree?
- Not at all.

592
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,580
Of course not.

593
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,592
I must not be very perceptive.

594
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,640
I didn't see a thing.

595
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,353
No one saw a thing.

596
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,651
Think you'll be destroyed for long?

597
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,010
Lots of charming guys around,
you know?

598
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,735
- Like you?
- Yes, good example.

599
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,658
- You don't believe in love.
- No.

600
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,534
But... I believe in friendship.

601
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,379
I hate seeing you like that.

602
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,160
Kiss her already!

603
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,175
What did we say?
I tap my wand and he turns into...?

604
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,860
- Prince Charming.
- Right, and kiss her!

605
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,640
Come on, not this again.

606
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,559
You wanted to be Prince Charming
and now...

607
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,878
you won't kiss her.
That's not charming, sorry!

608
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,612
You too! Everybody!

609
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,653
Get into character!
You have to believe a little!

610
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,580
Lulu, same thing!

611
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,659
Each time you offer the apple,
you look apologetic.

612
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,220
You're a witch.
So act like a witch a little!

613
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,218
I don't like being a witch.

614
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,791
Oh? What do you want to be?

615
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,910
A tree.

616
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,156
A tree?

617
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,935
Get to the right.

618
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,931
Right. Right!

619
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,779
Get to the right! The right!

620
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,050
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Sorry.

621
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,319
OK, we're all right, but...

622
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,114
when I grab the wheel,
you have to let me.

623
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,277
You fought me, you can't fight.

624
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,232
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry!

625
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,080
How long has it been
since you drove?

626
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,714
I don't know, 10 years.

627
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,071
Sure, but even then,
it was the same.

628
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,395
I was paralysed.

629
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,113
I thought I was more mature.

630
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,880
That I'd be more at ease.
But it's like before.

631
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,010
I'm paralysed... terrified.

632
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,954
No reason to be terrified.

633
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,800
There is!
I keep feeling I'm going to die.

634
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,400
Or else kill people.

635
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,756
It's a fantasy.

636
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,109
I understand.

637
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,229
A fantasy, but that's just it.

638
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,909
It is a fantasy.

639
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,357
You can't always just submit.

640
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,472
Take control, we're not children.

641
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,956
We must be capable
of taking control.

642
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,390
Right.

643
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,512
That's what I'm trying to do.

644
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,159
Maybe acupuncture,
at the same time, could help.

645
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,794
Maybe it will relax me.

646
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,156
Well, in any case, thanks.

647
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,512
For dropping me off.

648
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,711
No problem, it's on my way.

649
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,674
- See you Thursday?
- Right. Thursday.

650
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,237
- Sure you won't have coffee?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.

651
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,499
See? That's my car.

652
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,850
See you Thursday.

653
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,175
Thursday.

654
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,330
Excuse me...

655
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,293
Excuse me, I'm lost.

656
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,935
I'm going to Rue des Acacias.
Lost my way.

657
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,972
Rue des Acacias?
I'm going there.

658
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,500
Can I drop you?

659
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,793
No. Thank you, but...

660
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,480
I wanted to walk. I've been there,

661
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,795
but I always drove.

662
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,513
Now I'm completely lost.

663
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,036
All right.

664
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,231
It depends
what you expect from life.

665
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,799
If you want to go fast,
no time to lose,

666
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,075
if you know exactly what you want,
it's straight ahead, then right.

667
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:22,452
But if you're more of a dreamer,
open to the unknown, a thinker,

668
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,855
that way.

669
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,260
It's longer, but much prettier.

670
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,698
It's called "Needle Way".

671
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,096
Well thanks.

672
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,449
Don't mention it.

673
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,716
I'm waiting to see which way you go.

674
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,174
I got totally lost.

675
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,213
I cut through the woods.
I got all turned around.

676
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,980
Fortunately,
this guy straightened me out.

677
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,654
He wanted to drive me.

678
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,271
He was strange. Know what he said?

679
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,278
This corkscrew is impossible.

680
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,110
Hello.

681
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,158
Was it pretty? Like the walk?

682
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,013
You know each other?

683
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,100
He's the one.
The man who gave me directions.

684
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,896
This is Maxime. My neighbour.

685
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,530
I mentioned him.

686
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,731
Laura, my darling niece.

687
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,816
Laura...

688
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,894
Want some wine?

689
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,090
Sure.

690
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,736
I'll go, Marianne.

691
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,010
You can stay.

692
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,654
I have to go anyway.

693
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,820
A pleasure, Laura.
Maybe see you soon?

694
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,294
Yes, maybe.

695
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,414
Tomorrow your life changes.
You'll have a 21st-century corkscrew.

696
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,020
One that unscrews corks.

697
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,740
Thanks for the extension cord!

698
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,896
He's great.

699
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,418
You know he's in music?

700
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,213
Really? What does he do?

701
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,696
I don't know,
I didn't really get it.

702
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,176
I know he writes articles.

703
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,578
Critiques... I don't know.

704
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,818
And he works for a festival.
Or an orchestra.

705
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,250
I can't recall, but he's in music.

706
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,876
Funny.

707
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,198
- Pretty, right?
- Yeah.

708
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,912
"Hi, Mum! Hi, Laura!"

709
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,110
How are you, Laura?

710
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,192
I have no idea what's wrong.

711
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,950
It's been 2 hours.
She won't talk, won't answer.

712
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,956
The Bible's not doing her any good.

713
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,639
I'll go say hello.

714
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,777
In any case,
I know when this shit got into her.

715
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,154
Well then, please Eric, let's do it.
Let's at least try.

716
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,796
- We'll go see Devaux, the 3 of us.
- No, please.

717
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,798
What's so terrible?

718
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,754
What are you afraid of?

719
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,553
I'm afraid of nothing.

720
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,354
I won't go see some guy
with his own ideas about parenting

721
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,439
so he can drum us full
of his personal morality! What a bore!

722
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,552
You don't know, you never tried.

723
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,172
And this is for Nina.

724
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,860
Not for you.
I'm not trying to convince you.

725
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,530
Try.

726
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,137
A shrink can tell me nothing new.

727
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,058
It's our separation
that Nina can't stand.

728
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,352
Are you doing so much better
since you started therapy?

729
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,434
Yes, I'm doing better.

730
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,154
<i>Hundreds of dead fish.
Utter devastation.</i>

731
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,079
<i>Local people all point
to upriver Casseul Industries,</i>

732
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,873
<i>saying they fill these waters</i>

733
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,714
<i>with toxic waste.</i>

734
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,274
<i>CEO Guillaume Casseul</i>

735
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,950
<i>denies his company had a role
in this ecological disaster,</i>

736
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,278
<i>but the company stock price
took a plunge...</i>

737
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,450
Mum?

738
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,854
Mum, could I take this
to Dad's tomorrow?

739
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,255
You're not going.

740
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,498
He called.
He can't. Something came up.

741
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,750
Come on.

742
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,635
I mentioned it, I didn't call him.
It just came up.

743
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,435
He'll feel obliged.

744
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,315
He'll think I put you up to it.
I don't care if he comes!

745
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,999
Hardly knows I make music!

746
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,537
And if it's so he can scowl

747
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,416
like at the Legion of Honour,
no thanks!

748
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,497
I said it just came up.

749
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,738
I said Sandro's concert is soon.
I didn't say to come.

750
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,060
"Sandro's concert."

751
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,696
What? It's not your concert?

752
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,096
It's a finals recital.

753
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,651
There are others. It's not just me.

754
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,820
I say "Sandro's concert," too.
We don't care about the others.

755
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,493
Did Laura hear it already?

756
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,770
Did she like it?

757
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,177
He won't let me. He wants me
to hear it fresh, in concert.

758
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,939
Directly at the concert?

759
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,716
Of course, Mum. No comparison!

760
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,477
I'll be finished in two minutes.

761
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,239
Where do we meet after?

762
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,656
My place?

763
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,090
Your place?

764
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,334
Your place is better.

765
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,258
My place?
My place.

766
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,158
She sees herself
in a pretty white dress, that's why.

767
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,838
Sure, but...
that's incidental.

768
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,030
Lots of girls
want a first communion.

769
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,514
It's not about that.

770
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,573
The move maybe.

771
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,690
Maybe.

772
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,500
As I see it,

773
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,700
I'm hearing about a girl
who's not with us.

774
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,099
Who isn't concentrating.

775
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,859
You know, when children...

776
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,940
when they feel things are
a little... unstable,

777
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,117
they need to find reassurance.

778
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,078
I was recently separated.

779
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,450
But it's fine. Everything's fine...

780
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,895
For the child,
I certainly hope so.

781
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,650
By the way,

782
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,734
I thought it over.

783
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,495
I'm OK with it.

784
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,574
You're OK with what?

785
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,649
What you wanted.

786
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,633
How you wanted us to be.

787
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,280
To be freer.

788
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,395
I'm OK with it.
You're right.

789
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,354
Want us to try?

790
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,439
To get back together?

791
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,895
You don't love me anymore.

792
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:03,616
Don't. I'll always love you.
That's not the point.

793
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,089
Sorry, I'm no good.

794
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,098
No big deal, we're alive.

795
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,860
No, I can't even drive.

796
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,654
I can't even...
I'll never drive again.

797
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,391
You can drive.
Just check the rear-view mirror.

798
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,917
I'll give you a manual, for review.

799
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,077
My husband did the driving.

800
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,073
He didn't want me to drive.

801
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,371
He was right. We nearly died!

802
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,114
It's your second lesson.

803
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,838
I wanted only to be alone,
to be independent.

804
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,580
It was my dream.

805
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,414
Now I realise...

806
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,413
I need help with everything.

807
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,137
I'm handicapped, it's horrible.

808
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,658
I have to re-learn everything.

809
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,449
It sucks to be alone.

810
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,936
No, don't say that.
It's wonderful.

811
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,420
The peace of mind.

812
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,653
No obligations, no negotiations.
No noise.

813
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,276
Well...

814
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,436
Should we go?

815
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,711
Ignition, signal, rear-view.

816
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,690
Are you sure?

817
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,814
We can't stay here.

818
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,340
You don't want to drive?

819
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,894
I already know how.

820
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,136
We almost died!

821
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,615
No. I'm not supposed to die today.

822
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,136
You're not?

823
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,959
When are you supposed to die?

824
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,309
March 14th.

825
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,756
- This year?
- This year, yes.

826
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,275
Really?

827
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,173
Just a note of levity.

828
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,212
This astrologer, a madwoman...

829
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,172
told me that 40 years ago.

830
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,452
They never say the date of death.

831
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,379
They see it, but they don't tell.
I'm surprised!

832
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,820
Well I don't care.

833
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,250
Fortune-teller ethics don't matter to me.

834
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,053
I really don't care.

835
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,375
Ready to go?

836
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,450
They have no right.

837
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,537
Yeah, I know. But I don't care.

838
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,730
Ignition.

839
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,010
Signal.

840
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,355
Rear-view.

841
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,115
No, the rear-view
is to see behind you.

842
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,138
- Bravo again!
- Thank you.

843
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,250
- Call me?
- Sure.

844
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,815
- I was so embarrassed.
- I didn't hear it.

845
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,613
Like it?

846
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,971
It was remarkable. Quality writing!

847
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,420
Look. Behind you.

848
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,576
The composer?

849
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,970
Maxime Wolff.

850
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,454
I know who you are.

851
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,014
Your work is great.

852
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,371
I'll leave you to your friends.
But here's my card.

853
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,936
This is my card.

854
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,775
Call me.

855
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,812
I'd like to discuss an idea.

856
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,930
All right.

857
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,918
Laura, why are you here?
Are you lost again?

858
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,520
No, not this time.

859
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,472
Too bad, I can't help you.

860
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,190
See you round?

861
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,035
- See you?
- Yes.

862
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,830
You know Wolff?

863
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,399
- Did you know he was coming?
- No, I didn't!

864
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,071
- Incredible. What luck.
- You knew?

865
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,270
No, I didn't know!

866
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,595
Is he famous?

867
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,597
What do we do first?

868
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,554
We put our stuff away!
That's right!

869
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,437
What is it? Why the long face?

870
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,872
Why are you frowning? Simon.

871
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,959
Want to be a squirrel,
if you won't kiss her?

872
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,312
She's the one who won't.

873
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,479
Really? Why?

874
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,398
She doesn't love me anymore.

875
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,520
We'll see, no big deal.

876
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,120
It is a big deal.

877
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,055
No, listen...

878
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,094
We'll think it over...

879
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:04,459
we'll work it out.

880
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,259
- I don't know...
- Can I be a dog?

881
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,890
Sure, yeah...

882
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,535
Well, is there a dog in the show?

883
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,858
There are lots of animals.
Sure, no problem.

884
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,014
Want to be a squirrel?

885
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,893
No, I don't play animals.

886
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,895
Well... Sure you don't mind,
half way through the term?

887
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,977
No! Just the opposite.

888
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,899
No, I need a flower.
I need a squirrel.

889
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,660
My mushroom shows up
only half the time.

890
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,910
See you Wednesday?

891
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,475
- Yes, thanks.
- My pleasure.

892
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,114
Well... goodbye.

893
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,230
Goodbye, girls!

894
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,350
Time to go!

895
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,671
The worst is when even close friends
start to have doubts.

896
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,110
Maybe they're not that close.

897
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,113
It's understandable.

898
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,709
So tempting to join the pack.

899
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,979
And he's not even polluting.

900
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,250
There you are!

901
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,812
One more reason not to worry.

902
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,378
Rumours pass.

903
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,979
People will tire of it.

904
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,297
That's what made you so sad?

905
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,174
Yes. Well...

906
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,573
Life in general.

907
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,592
These days, I don't know...

908
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,320
it's complicated.

909
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,974
True, it's complicated.

910
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,710
Oh, Maxime! You here?

911
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,459
- Hi.
- How are you?

912
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,696
Not cold?

913
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,459
SEPARATE AND GROW

914
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,131
GETTING FAMILIAR WITH DEATH

915
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,773
And with your father?

916
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,699
No, with my father it's fine.

917
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,139
He's dead anyway, so...

918
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,660
Want to talk about him?

919
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,479
How'd your father treat you?

920
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,398
No, listen. I said no.

921
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,593
My problem is...

922
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,080
I don't understand.

923
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,000
I don't recognise myself.

924
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,915
I don't buy that shit.
How can it get to me?

925
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,111
That's what I want to know.

926
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,030
Is this the first time
you can't control something?

927
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,129
Look,

928
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,252
I think coming here was a mistake.

929
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,016
I need an answer here and now.

930
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,460
I don't want to...

931
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,179
spend years just...

932
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,929
How much do I owe?

933
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,096
Nothing.

934
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,896
Thank you.

935
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,893
Very good solo, Julian.

936
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,171
From the same place again, please.

937
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:01,576
So I pushed it, I said,
"why not play it at the festival?"

938
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,259
He said yes, on the spot!

939
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,419
- Horwitz?
- Horwitz!

940
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,139
That's amazing!

941
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:12,455
Horwitz wants to play my piece?

942
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,900
Holy shit!

943
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,540
He liked it that much?

944
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,899
He might tell you himself.

945
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,251
I gave him your number,
he'll call you.

946
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,452
Holy shit, this is... amazing.
Amazing!

947
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,972
Wait a second.
I don't understand.

948
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:30,296
The orchestra is full. So he...

949
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,254
He would take the place
of the 1st violin. Got to.

950
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,833
Julien's place?

951
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,156
If his name is Julien, then yes.

952
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,555
- Really?
- Of course.

953
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,839
He's my friend.

954
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,476
Not about your friend.
You want your music to be known?

955
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,434
This is an uncanny break.
You don't get that?

956
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,535
Sure I do.

957
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,652
It was really special today.

958
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,770
Nice of you.

959
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,732
It's not nice, it's what I think.

960
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,420
Great, Sandro.

961
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,860
I'm very happy.

962
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,694
- Very happy.
- Right.

963
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,410
Sandro!

964
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,139
Starting to shape up!

965
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,730
Did Wolff like it?

966
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,851
- You think I'm awful.
- No way.

967
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,256
- I'm ashamed.
- Of what?

968
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,860
I'm in love with Sandro.

969
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,097
I think of someone else,
it's not normal.

970
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:30,258
Normal or not...
What is normal anyway?

971
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,998
Can't imagine how guilty I feel.

972
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,750
Yes, I imagine it very well.
I ruined my life with that guilt.

973
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,219
He invited me to a party.

974
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,856
Really?

975
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,139
But I'm not going to go.

976
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,475
Fuck...

977
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,559
I have to call Sandro.

978
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,354
I don't know how to tell him.
What do I do?

979
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,636
He left me so many messages,
it's terrible.

980
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,032
Maybe a text message?

981
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,750
Not as harsh.

982
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,118
Well, not as harsh for you.

983
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,833
Eat your apple!

984
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,712
In this light, I see them.

985
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,735
Mum!

986
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,618
My mother says I have wrinkles.

987
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,333
Not wrinkles, fine lines.

988
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,816
- Wrinkles!
- Fine lines.

989
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:06,853
Come on, she's fabulous.
She's perfect.

990
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,119
Marianne, I know about this.

991
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,119
You have to act early.
The sooner the better.

992
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,920
She can't get a facelift at 24,
that's ludicrous!

993
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,030
I use creams.

994
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,836
It's not a facelift. It's acid
produced by the body, re-injected.

995
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,520
She's 24. She's got time!

996
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,871
She doesn't have to act like you.

997
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,292
Like me? Meaning?

998
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,630
I don't know...

999
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,875
Like you.

1000
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,637
You have stuff done.

1001
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,877
Why? What stuff do I have done?

1002
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:43,099
I don't know.
I have no idea what you got done.

1003
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,577
You're 62, Fanfan.

1004
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,650
I didn't mean to hurt her feelings.

1005
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,493
- Then why say that?
- I said her age.

1006
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,420
I can't pretend to...

1007
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:03,892
You think old age is fun?

1008
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,850
What do you mean?

1009
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,370
As an actress, well...

1010
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,476
You like your wrinkles, folds,
sagging flesh?

1011
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,716
You think it's fun?

1012
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,434
No, I don't.

1013
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,994
Neither does she.

1014
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,736
Nobody does.

1015
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,135
It was about Laura.

1016
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,418
We have to go now anyway.

1017
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,650
Nina, stop.
You'll get all marked up.

1018
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,216
Should I drop you?

1019
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:35,336
No, thanks. We'll walk a little.

1020
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,213
You still don't drive?

1021
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:39,619
No, I still don't.

1022
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,415
What are you doing?

1023
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:49,180
The apartment is ready.
I'm starting to pack.

1024
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,651
It's ready? Today is only the 8th.

1025
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,214
Yes, but it's ready.

1026
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,296
Morgane?

1027
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,811
Go get me your sister's bag.

1028
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,215
Why doesn't she go?

1029
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,013
She never does a thing!

1030
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,658
We're leaving tomorrow.

1031
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,372
Tomorrow we'll be gone.

1032
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,295
A relief for you,
and me too actually.

1033
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,774
For everyone.

1034
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,050
But...

1035
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,694
All right.

1036
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:22,018
That contrite pose is great.

1037
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,540
It's not a pose.

1038
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,615
I'm... surprised.

1039
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,538
A pleasant surprise, isn't it?

1040
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,757
We'll get past this rough period.

1041
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,917
- Rough?
- Oh yes.

1042
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,097
You went through hell and I...

1043
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,334
Thank you. You did us a favour.
You took us in.

1044
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,816
Three people, invading your space.

1045
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:47,218
It was your idea.
You suggested it.

1046
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:52,814
I never got why
you were so closed up, so icy.

1047
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,216
I even thought you had
a serious problem, you couldn't share.

1048
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,456
I had one.

1049
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,730
What?

1050
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:08,059
Nothing, it's silly.
Something... stuck inside my head.

1051
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,458
What? You thought I'd force your hand,
form a new family? That it?

1052
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,291
No. You never talk anyway.

1053
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:19,811
You're shut tight like a vault.
No one can talk to you.

1054
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,473
Anyway, we'll be gone tomorrow.

1055
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,931
Who is he? Do I know him?

1056
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,060
Oh, I know him!

1057
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,739
I said no.

1058
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,950
Well...

1059
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,591
Rehearsals going well?

1060
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,314
Yeah, fine.

1061
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,999
I'll come get my things.

1062
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,578
I brought them for you.

1063
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,990
You're a funny one.

1064
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,032
These things happen.

1065
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,389
Four days out.

1066
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,393
Go tell the caterer.

1067
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,792
Cancel everything.
Call everyone back. Lovely.

1068
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,196
I know, everything I do is bad.

1069
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,199
You have time, darling.
To fall in love, to...

1070
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,153
There's nothing in the paper.

1071
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,397
Where do they say you did nothing?

1072
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,672
Page 10. Now that he's innocent,
no one cares.

1073
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,440
I don't get it.

1074
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,472
You met the man of your dreams.
Two minutes later, it's over.

1075
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,975
You don't realise.

1076
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,250
I do realise!

1077
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,690
I'm not a retard,
whatever you think.

1078
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:01,779
I won't get married
because you ordered cheese puffs

1079
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,653
and a new pair of breasts!

1080
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,170
Stop being angry at your dad.

1081
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,576
I'm not angry.
I don't care.

1082
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,133
He always did his part.

1083
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:15,420
I know, Mum. He's perfect.

1084
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,611
- Always has been.
- Not perfect.

1085
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:18,856
He's been up front.

1086
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:22,656
He always said he didn't want kids.
Always been there in a pinch.

1087
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,339
I know, you told me.

1088
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,895
- That's right.
- Right, and all is well.

1089
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:31,934
Are you getting on?

1090
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,857
I'm not taking anything.

1091
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,653
I'm trying to muddle through.

1092
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,175
Is it working?

1093
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,700
Well, no.

1094
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:58,090
I'm stuck.

1095
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,018
Have you tried sophrology?

1096
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,572
Yoga. Yoga is very good.

1097
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,929
Really?

1098
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:06,578
You believe in all that?

1099
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,817
I believe in what does you good.

1100
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,612
Eléonore is very happy.
She says thanks... for the kids.

1101
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,460
- No problem. Very cute girls.
- Yeah.

1102
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:21,570
No?

1103
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,851
Sure, they're cute.

1104
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:29,655
Didn't I park a little crooked?

1105
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,214
No, it's fine.

1106
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:35,492
I can't Tuesday. An audition.

1107
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,532
- Good!
- Well...

1108
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:38,889
But Saturday is good.

1109
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,713
In the morning.
I might be dead by afternoon.

1110
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,479
Oh shit. The 14th?

1111
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,951
If you'd rather stay home, I get it.

1112
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,197
I'm kidding, no problem.

1113
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:56,199
I'm obsessed but...
I haven't gone mad.

1114
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,960
- Saturday?
- Yes.

1115
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,196
Saturday.

1116
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,635
Marianne guessed
we'd get together.

1117
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:16,976
Really?

1118
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,090
Right away!

1119
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,139
You believe in destiny?

1120
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,296
What?

1121
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,615
No, nothing.

1122
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,359
I didn't hear. What?

1123
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,112
Do you believe in destiny?

1124
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,799
I'm going now.

1125
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,912
You staying, or should I drop you?

1126
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,079
I looked at your message.

1127
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,269
By accident.

1128
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,914
My message?

1129
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,240
A text message.

1130
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,315
From Rose.

1131
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,680
By accident.

1132
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,475
You went into my phone by accident?

1133
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,452
I read her message, it was...

1134
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:42,219
"Your kisses all over me.
And now I have to wait!"

1135
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,933
That's her message.

1136
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:47,810
Laura...

1137
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:53,578
it isn't nice to go through
other people's things.

1138
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:59,220
Open the wrong door,
don't complain about what you find.

1139
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,351
If anyone can complain, it's me.

1140
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,812
In case you didn't know,
there is such a thing as privacy.

1141
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,859
I'm going,
close the door behind you.

1142
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,874
<i>... temperatures
well above normal for the season...</i>

1143
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,151
<i>...a crisis without precedent.</i>

1144
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,159
<i>... this spring,
unemployment spiked,</i>

1145
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,192
<i>especially among rural youth...</i>

1146
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,277
<i>...attributable to human activities,</i>

1147
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,791
<i>to deforestation, to greenhouse
gas emission increases.</i>

1148
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,039
<i>Clearly, all this yields
an unrelenting warming of the planet,</i>

1149
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:16,915
<i>at a rate never before
recorded in human history...</i>

1150
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,671
No desire to see it, or know it.

1151
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,998
That's why you shouldn't
have looked, he's right.

1152
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,156
But...

1153
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,040
fidelity...

1154
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,230
It's just an idea.
It doesn't hold up.

1155
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,474
People sleep with each other.
That's how it is.

1156
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,714
Then it's horrible!

1157
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,116
When I'm in love,
I desire no one else.

1158
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,072
Or it means I'm not in love.

1159
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,039
You say that
because your lifestyle...

1160
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,640
is a little unusual.

1161
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,070
But...

1162
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,160
Unusual?

1163
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,270
Really?

1164
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,516
Extremely free.

1165
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,640
Extremely free?

1166
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,190
That's him.

1167
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,889
He wants to see me.

1168
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,052
The way she looked at him...

1169
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:04,659
Like she looked at me,
but it wasn't me.

1170
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:06,737
Wolff is a frisky one.

1171
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:09,649
He's very frisky.

1172
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,932
He wanted to take me home
after rehearsal.

1173
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,760
Really? No!

1174
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,793
Yeah, he did.
He must hit on everybody.

1175
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,359
By the way,
when do you tell Julien he's fired?

1176
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,794
I don't feel right.

1177
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:26,351
I'm going to... tell him.

1178
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,550
I'll tell him.

1179
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,676
That language you use!
"Anti-social"!

1180
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,395
A 9-year-old,
"anti-social, chronic failure"!

1181
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,136
All I said was...

1182
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,820
You have little boxes,
to file people away!

1183
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:45,455
You always imply
Marianne is a bad mother.

1184
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:48,698
I think she's an excellent mother!
And I've seen her!

1185
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,700
No reason to get upset.

1186
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,654
There is reason!
I am getting upset.

1187
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,772
I think it's incredible...

1188
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,210
that you are so... uncharitable.

1189
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,959
There. I'm going.

1190
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,639
Anyway, that covers it.

1191
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:11,379
Sorry. She got to me.

1192
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,095
No, don't be sorry.
That was great.

1193
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:16,371
I wish I could answer her like that.

1194
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:20,210
Plus, Nina's doing better. Right?
Not scratching as much.

1195
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,439
Yes. She hardly scratches anymore.

1196
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,075
- She gave up on communion.
- Really?

1197
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,759
She wants to ride a pony.

1198
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,755
No shit?

1199
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,520
She's searching.

1200
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,915
You really think I'm a good mother?

1201
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,915
Of course I do.

1202
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,413
Bravo.
That's all for today, thank you.

1203
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,090
I have one note.
The woodwinds, at bar 8...

1204
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:53,497
a little more character
and it would be perfect.

1205
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,736
I'll speak to them.

1206
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,877
What's with Clémence? Is she mad?

1207
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,639
I don't know.

1208
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,470
Get a drink?

1209
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,597
I can't, I have an appointment.

1210
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,916
See you tomorrow.

1211
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,520
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

1212
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:24,138
Fine. I'm very glad.

1213
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:29,740
Horwitz will be here at noon
tomorrow, for the second go-around.

1214
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,819
We'll re-schedule rehearsals.
He can't do mornings.

1215
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,176
- Fucking drag!
- Excuse me?

1216
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,416
No, I mean...

1217
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,291
The Julien thing bothers me.

1218
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,254
Bothers you? How?

1219
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:47,894
I don't want to replace him.
I don't want to.

1220
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:49,249
You don't want to?

1221
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:51,454
Little late for regrets.

1222
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,073
I never liked it.
Julien's been there all along.

1223
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,112
He's a friend. My friend.

1224
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,234
Did you say no?

1225
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,474
Did you tell me no?

1226
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,030
No, if you don't mind,
I'd rather you don't drive today.

1227
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,640
Oh yeah, right.

1228
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,632
You very rarely signal.

1229
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,830
Really?

1230
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,472
I must have forgotten.

1231
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:43,655
We could have had coffee
at my house.

1232
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,578
Yeah, that's true.

1233
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,154
How did your audition go?

1234
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,193
I'm in the final three,
they'll call back.

1235
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,436
But...

1236
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,274
The kids' show is coming up.
It's almost ready.

1237
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,955
Will you come see it?

1238
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:10,054
- No?
- Well, no. Because...

1239
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:20,540
You're not seriously
thinking about it?

1240
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:21,650
About what?

1241
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,419
The date of... Today.

1242
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,370
That thing... Your date of death.

1243
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,813
How many lessons do I need?

1244
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,613
You know how to drive already.

1245
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:40,860
It's all in your head.

1246
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,817
When you're with me, I'm OK.

1247
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:46,772
But alone...
Look out!

1248
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,970
Sorry.

1249
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:58,898
- It's OK.
- I never saw it.

1250
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,090
Never saw it.

1251
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,938
What a wonderful wine.

1252
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,411
Won't you order something?

1253
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,175
I'm not hungry.

1254
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,057
You live on love and Saint-Emilion?

1255
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:41,136
Go ahead,
you can answer if you want.

1256
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,455
Yes, I know.

1257
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,560
Did you see her?

1258
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,955
See who?

1259
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,716
Rose.

1260
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,294
Answer me.

1261
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:06,137
We covered this.
Must we speak of Rose each time?

1262
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,237
- If you still love her, tell me.
- If I still love her?

1263
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,029
You don't?

1264
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,431
Stop, this is ridiculous.

1265
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,034
Why? If we're together,
it's natural for...

1266
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,435
If we're together?

1267
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,276
Laura, we've been out 3 times.

1268
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,635
More.

1269
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,158
Five times, maybe six?

1270
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,834
We're not together.

1271
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,752
I don't want to be with anyone.
I thought that was clear.

1272
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:13,691
I was an idiot. Believe me, I know.

1273
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,540
I couldn't tell you.

1274
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,531
I'm sorry. I feel terrible.

1275
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:25,899
That's why I saw Horwitz.

1276
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:29,052
I wondered why he was here.

1277
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,350
Fuck...

1278
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:41,109
It's great.

1279
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,596
- Yeah, but...
- No, it's great!

1280
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,260
Horwitz!

1281
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:48,734
You can't say no.

1282
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,160
You know that Wolff
is seeing Laura?

1283
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,555
I heard, yeah.

1284
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:05,372
Wolff's a charming guy, isn't he?

1285
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,755
I'm cancelling.

1286
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,076
You play or I cancel. He can't...

1287
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,112
No! Don't cancel a thing!

1288
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:20,359
Are you nuts?
It's great. Everyone will come.

1289
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,359
Everyone will hear you.
It's really great.

1290
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:27,697
We've got years to play together.

1291
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,973
We're friends.
We won't be out of touch.

1292
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,415
We're friends, right?

1293
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,617
Why are you here, Mushroom?

1294
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:19,414
My wand! It doesn't work!
Did you replace it?

1295
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,239
You brought it for repair?

1296
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:25,080
It broke right before
the concert. Fantastic!

1297
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,877
What a situation. So...

1298
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,036
Clémence?

1299
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,756
Meet you later?

1300
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,354
I left you a message.

1301
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,120
It's done. I told Julien.

1302
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,094
How did he take it?

1303
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,173
He was great.

1304
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,275
It was horrible.

1305
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:52,037
I said I'd cancel
if he wasn't playing with us.

1306
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,436
- He said no.
- Of course not.

1307
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,319
- What do you mean?
- What could he say?

1308
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:01,512
You knew he'd say that.
The time to act was before.

1309
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:04,375
It's easy to play hero now.

1310
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,360
Wow.
No clemency from Clémence.

1311
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,036
What? You want sympathy, as usual?

1312
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,834
Julien gets my sympathy.
It's always about you!

1313
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,077
I'm sick of showing clemency!

1314
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:22,336
I got to go.

1315
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:29,339
Laura's waiting for you.

1316
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:41,736
How are you?

1317
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:45,734
Looking for Maxime?

1318
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,377
I'm not looking for Maxime.

1319
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,096
Are you well?

1320
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:52,132
Yeah. Sure.

1321
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,752
- And you?
- Great!

1322
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:59,312
How are your parents?

1323
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,832
How are your parents?

1324
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,911
Are you busy? This a bad time?

1325
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,315
No, but...

1326
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,035
You got something to do?

1327
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:14,799
Got something to say?

1328
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,833
Yeah, I can't remember.

1329
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,835
I better go.

1330
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,030
Sure you're OK?

1331
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:26,471
Oh right!
I just wanted to mention this.

1332
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,754
I can't remember which scientist.

1333
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:33,430
My dad is clean as a whistle.
He did nothing, it's proven!

1334
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,794
I just mentioned it.

1335
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,434
Where the hell is my car?

1336
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,756
Oh right, I didn't drive.

1337
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:06,613
Yeah. Jacqueline, it's me.
It's Pierre.

1338
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:09,731
You must be working.

1339
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,797
Actually, I just called to...

1340
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,972
No, it's stupid. Never mind.

1341
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:22,570
Anyway, I hope you're doing well.

1342
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,350
Love you.

1343
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,034
Love you, Jacqueline.

1344
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:41,649
Marianne!

1345
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,300
Too bad you're not home.

1346
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:46,934
Oh shit.

1347
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:53,289
I wanted to tell you, you're right.
It's great to be free.

1348
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:56,915
Marianne...

1349
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:07,709
Want a beer?

1350
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,040
Why are you here?

1351
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,594
I wanted to see you.

1352
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:40,853
So you know where I live?

1353
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:50,715
Come on up.

1354
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,590
Right.

1355
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,000
I wanted to tell you,

1356
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,711
I thought it over. You can have it.

1357
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,229
The money you wanted.

1358
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:11,732
I don't need it, I worked it out.

1359
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:12,896
Really?

1360
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:14,856
Oh shit.

1361
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:22,419
I'll give it to you anyway.

1362
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:24,576
I can't use it.

1363
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:27,295
No, I'm telling you,
I worked it out.

1364
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,916
I thought it over.
It should be yours.

1365
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:35,033
He loved you.
If he had made a will...

1366
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:37,034
If he had the time...

1367
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,229
Come on, please.

1368
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:45,690
Keep it.

1369
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,199
Well, then thank you.

1370
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:11,738
So Laura, in the end...

1371
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:15,010
- Didn't work out?
- No, it didn't.

1372
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:20,420
How's your music?

1373
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:22,930
Yeah.

1374
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,816
Last time, I was curt because...

1375
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:33,339
every time you call
you ask for money.

1376
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:36,860
What else can I ask of you?

1377
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:12,471
I never saw that picture
of you and my father.

1378
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,833
What's going on?

1379
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,280
Nothing.

1380
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:26,298
- I don't like outbursts.
- Yeah, I know that.

1381
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:38,112
Want something to drink?

1382
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,230
Something strong?

1383
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,192
Yeah, I have vodka.

1384
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,879
Vodka would be fine.

1385
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:03,659
- Not too much.
- Say when.

1386
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,369
Did you have plans?

1387
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,616
No, it's fine.

1388
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,760
It's nice.

1389
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:49,915
Wait up.

1390
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,197
That's Laura, Sandro's girl.

1391
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,757
- You sure?
- Yeah, that's her!

1392
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,789
Yes, all right.

1393
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,879
Thank you, Clémence.

1394
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,029
Laura is on the street in a stupor.

1395
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,231
A friend said she's totally drunk.

1396
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,794
Laura, your...

1397
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,299
What can I do about it?

1398
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:23,693
We can't leave her like that.

1399
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:25,889
Where is she?

1400
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,489
I didn't want to worry you, but...

1401
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:32,180
We're here.
We're at the bus stop.

1402
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:37,019
Be right there. She left me
this crazy message. I'm coming.

1403
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:06,533
A little further up.

1404
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:09,819
- Here.
- Yes.

1405
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,450
Careful.

1406
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,972
No-one saw her.

1407
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:47,530
Maxime, finally.
Sorry about the messages...

1408
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:48,696
Really?

1409
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:51,897
Really? Is she...

1410
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:53,649
How is she?

1411
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:58,373
We'll be right there.

1412
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,074
She's outside my house.

1413
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:06,038
He found her on the sidewalk.
Unconscious.

1414
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:07,389
She doesn't react.

1415
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,515
Thirsty...

1416
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,120
Sitting...

1417
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,640
Zirsting, sting...

1418
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,399
She wants to sit up.

1419
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,477
She says she's thirsty.

1420
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:20,738
Let her drink, but wake her up.
She took something.

1421
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:22,499
- Took what?
- Not sure.

1422
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:24,418
I think she said she took stuff.

1423
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,515
I'm going.

1424
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,199
I'll go with you.

1425
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:37,552
Sorry, she won't wake up.
I'm calling an ambulance.

1426
01:43:37,680 --> 01:43:39,672
No, don't get all worried.

1427
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:43,514
I know a way
to wake a sleeping princess.

1428
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:51,775
See? It works.

1429
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:55,573
I have to get up early.
Good night.

1430
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,100
Good night, Marianne.

1431
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,091
Everything worked out in the end.

1432
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:22,850
Well...

1433
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:26,380
I pushed Laura into his arms,
instead of...

1434
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:28,916
Awful.

1435
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:32,417
You say he's usually charming?

1436
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:38,071
When he wants to be,
he is charming. He was...

1437
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,149
super-charming.

1438
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:44,698
By the way, bravo!

1439
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,536
- Bravo?
- Yes!

1440
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:49,530
You drove on your own, at night.

1441
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:52,175
While making calls,
down all those streets!

1442
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,595
Bravo.

1443
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,836
I did?

1444
01:44:56,300 --> 01:44:57,529
I did.

1445
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:04,339
Two-fifteen.

1446
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,170
It's late.

1447
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:08,014
So it's the 15th.

1448
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:14,778
- And you're not dead.
- Hey, that's right.

1449
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:30,813
Guess you're laughing now.

1450
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:33,059
No, I'm not actually.

1451
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,700
Nice of you.

1452
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,734
You took care of me.

1453
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,360
Clémence saw you
and she called me.

1454
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:47,876
Clémence.

1455
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,880
Are you with her now?

1456
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:18,860
Not to Daddy.
The show's going to start.

1457
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:20,972
You can wave from over there.

1458
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,192
Go, Mushroom. Go.

1459
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,350
OK, you stay here.

1460
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:37,039
Go stand behind there.

1461
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:47,300
What are you doing here?

1462
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:49,059
I came to see the show.

1463
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,576
The show?

1464
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:53,379
Watch out, lots of kids in it.

1465
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:00,193
I wanted to see you, too.

1466
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,034
I want to talk.

1467
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,799
You were right, I...

1468
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:10,397
I was afraid of, I don't know.
But I realised...

1469
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:11,954
It's starting.

1470
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:24,218
Once upon a time,
a beautiful young princess,

1471
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:25,933
like every princess,

1472
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:30,056
believed with all her heart
a great love awaited her.

1473
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,274
But... she was lost in a forest

1474
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,517
and couldn't find her way.

1475
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:00,850
Kiss her.

1476
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:03,890
Kiss him!

1477
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:05,010
Kiss him?

1478
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,955
They're supposed to kiss,
but things go awry.

1479
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,471
But the forest is still overjoyed!

1480
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,880
THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER

1481
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:05,618
AND OFTEN STRAYED...

1482
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,095
Bravo!

1483
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:13,691
Anaïs,
the princess and the prince, come!

1484
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:20,620
The princess! Anaïs!

1485
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:22,971
The Prince, Simon.

1486
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:26,655
Gabriel, the mushroom.

1487
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:31,260
Mathieu, the rabbit.

1488
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:35,614
And Selma, the pretty flower.

1489
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:43,135
Lauranie, the squirrel.

1490
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,215
The strawberry, Flore.

1491
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:50,340
Laura, the wolf.

1492
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:54,372
Lulu, the tree.

1493
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:58,852
And another flower, Candy.

1494
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:04,833
And I forgot... the dog, Joanna.

1495
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:07,330
Bravo, thank you.

1496
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:09,417
You can go
and say hello to your parents.
