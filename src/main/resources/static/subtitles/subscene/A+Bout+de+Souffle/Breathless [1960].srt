DEDICATED TO
MONOGRAM PICTURES

2
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:45,296
BREATHLESS

3
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,759
After all, I'm an asshole.

4
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:55,181
After all, yes, I've got to. I've got to!

5
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,708
Michel...

6
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:04,876
Take me with you.

7
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,502
- What time is it?
- 10:50.

8
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,004
No. Ciao!

9
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:11,174
Gotta make tracks, Max!

10
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,114
If he thinks he's gonna pass me
in his crappy Renault!

11
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,043
I collect the dough,

12
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,545
I ask Patricia if it's yes or no,

13
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,464
and then...

14
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,354
Nothing like the countryside.

15
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,907
I really like France.

16
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,039
If you don't like the shore...

17
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,835
if you don't like the mountains...

18
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:32,588
if you don't like the city...

19
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,050
then get stuffed!

20
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:46,227
Little girls hitchhiking!

21
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,938
I'll charge a kiss per mile.

22
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,277
The short one's not bad. Nice legs.

23
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:57,405
Yeah, but the other one...

24
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,949
Oh, hell, they're both dogs.

25
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,267
Nothing like sunshine.

26
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,984
Women drivers
are cowardice personified.

27
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:37,445
Pass him!

28
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,781
Oh, shit, it's the roadwork!

29
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,627
Never brake.

30
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:57,173
As old man Bugatti said:
"My cars are made to run, not stop."

31
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,343
Shit! The pigs!

32
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,276
Contact's gone!

33
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,530
This is the pits!

34
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,714
Hold it right there!

35
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,645
- Miss Franchini's room?
- She isn't here.

36
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,064
- She does live here?
- But she's out!

37
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:48,618
Girls never have cash.

38
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,953
Coffee.

39
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:57,084
- How much for ham and eggs?
- 180 francs.

40
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,297
Make it one.

41
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,719
Gotta get a paper. Be right back.

42
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,494
Can I come in?

43
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,496
How's it going, precious?

44
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,331
No jacket?

45
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,667
It's in my Alfa Romeo.

46
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,003
- Want breakfast at the Royal?
- I'm late.

47
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,673
Gotta be at the TV station at 9:10.

48
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,305
It's torn.

49
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,818
What've you been up to?

50
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,445
Nothing much. Traveling.

51
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,240
- What's new in the Quarter?
- Don't know.

52
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:13,661
- You don't go out?
- Dancing sometimes.

53
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,830
Still in the movies?

54
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,874
No. You gotta sleep around.

55
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,918
Do you recollect Enrico?

56
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:25,631
"Remember" or "recall."
But not "recollect."

57
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:29,135
I work with him at the station.
As script girl.

58
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,889
When I was broke in December,
I was assistant on a picture.

59
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,182
At Cinecittà!

60
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,184
- You?
- Yep, me.

61
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,061
Ever been a gigolo?

62
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:40,312
Why?

63
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,189
Just asking.

64
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:45,484
I wouldn't mind.

65
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,240
Call me back in a few minutes.

66
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,203
Is Gaby back from Spain?

67
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,415
- He bought the Café Pergola.
- He did?

68
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:00,916
Great.

69
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,377
The black paint's a stupid idea.

70
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,798
- What's that say?
- "Why?"

71
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,593
But I switched to Luckies.

72
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,431
Can you lend me 5,000 francs
till noon?

73
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,475
I should've known.

74
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:20,978
You're rotten, Michel.

75
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,272
I'll pay you back at noon.

76
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,566
Anyway, I don't have that much.

77
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:30,654
- Here's 500 if you want.
- Keep it.

78
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:59,850
- So no breakfast at the Royal?
- I'm really late.

79
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,776
Is Mr. Tolmachoff here?

80
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:11,487
He's here, but he's not here.

81
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,656
Seen Patricia?

82
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,043
Come with me to Rome?

83
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,089
It's crazy, but I love you.

84
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:33,467
I wanted to see
if I'd be glad to see you again.

85
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,678
Where you been? Monte Carlo?

86
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:40,266
No, Marseilles.
There was a guy I had to see.

87
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,309
I tried calling you Monday.

88
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,020
I was out of town Monday and Sunday.

89
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,359
- I'll take one.
- That's nice of you.

90
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:59,076
What are you doing here?
I thought you hated Paris.

91
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,912
No, but I've got enemies here.

92
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,539
So you're in danger?

93
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:06,250
Yeah. Will you come to Rome with me?

94
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,127
To do what?

95
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,378
We'll see.

96
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,131
No, I've got lots to do here.

97
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,675
You going up or down the Champs?

98
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,845
- What's the "Champs"?
- The Champs-Élysées.

99
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,392
- I gotta be on Avenue George V.
- See you, then.

100
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,561
Come on, walk me.

101
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,063
Just to the corner.

102
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,910
- Take it back. No horoscope!
- What's "horoscope"?

103
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:45,122
The future. I wanna know
the future. Don't you?

104
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,916
Sure.

105
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,383
- What is it?
- Nothing. Just looking at you.

106
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,639
You're mad I left without a good-bye.

107
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,767
No, I was furious
because I was sad.

108
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:10,105
It's nice to wake up next to a girl.

109
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:12,691
Are you staying in town?

110
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,862
Yeah, I have to see a guy
who owes me money.

111
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,864
Then I have to see you.

112
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,616
You don't have to.

113
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,368
Why?

114
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,079
There are prettier girls than me here.

115
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:28,874
No. It's weird.
I've slept with two girls since you.

116
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,460
We didn't jive at all.

117
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,046
You didn't "jive"?

118
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:39,260
They were pretty,
but we didn't jive. It was sad.

119
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,471
So will you come to Rome?
I'm fed up with France.

120
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,181
I can't, Michel.

121
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:48,394
I have to enroll at the Sorbonne
or my parents will stop sending money.

122
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,230
- I've got money.
- We only had three nights together.

123
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:53,148
No, five.

124
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,318
- Why don't you wear a bra?
- That's no way to talk.

125
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,821
Okay, sorry!

126
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,241
What time is it? See you later?

127
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:05,077
Not later. Tonight. Okay?

128
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,580
- Where?
- Here.

129
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,893
Live dangerously until the end!

130
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:39,737
Have you anything against youth?

131
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,614
Sure do. I prefer old people.

132
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,472
Police Killer Identified

133
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,980
Is Mr. Tolmachoff in?

134
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,566
At the airline desk.

135
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,752
- Hey, amigo.
- Hey, sonny.

136
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,587
You the one who came by at 10:00?

137
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,089
Yeah, for my money.

138
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,091
It's ready for you.

139
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,856
- How's life?
- I got bored down south.

140
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,109
I came up to see a girl. And you?

141
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,694
I'm getting out of here.
I'm rusting away.

142
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:05,322
Better rusted than busted.

143
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,036
Over here.

144
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,626
Have the envelope I gave you?

145
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,136
Why'd the jerk cross it?

146
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,930
Sign it over to someone else.

147
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,642
Not to me.
I blew my last cent at the races.

148
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,103
And your pal, Bob Montagné?

149
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,356
- He's in the pen, the idiot.
- No kidding.

150
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,984
There's Berruti, but I don't trust him.

151
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,194
I thought he was your pal.

152
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,487
Is he back?

153
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:49,158
Yes, I saw him
in Montparnasse last night.

154
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,916
What's his number?

155
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,085
Élysées 99 84.

156
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,920
Can I call from here?

157
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,844
Who's the girl you came for?

158
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,596
A New Yorker.

159
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,847
Pretty?

160
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,391
She's funny. I like her.

161
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,980
Élysées 99 84?

162
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,608
I'd like to speak to Antonio.

163
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,529
I'll call back.

164
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,742
He's out. I'll try somewhere else.

165
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,036
- Bye, sonny.
- Ciao, amigo.

166
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,921
Inter-Americana Agency?

167
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,089
Yes, this is it.

168
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:50,219
Do customers have mail
forwarded here?

169
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,889
Know a certain Michel Poiccard?

170
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:58,060
Also goes by the name
of László Kovács.

171
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,562
Ask the gentleman over there.

172
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,664
If it isn't Tolmachoff!

173
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,583
Hello, Inspector.

174
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,002
In the travel business now?

175
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,004
As you can see.

176
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:33,262
Remember how you ratted
on your friend Bob?

177
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,097
What if I did?

178
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,100
You're going to do it again.

179
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:41,603
Michel Poiccard, 5'9".

180
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,148
Brown hair.
Former Air France steward.

181
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,443
Has his mail sent here.

182
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,028
Yes, I know him.

183
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,948
He been around lately?

184
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,419
Has anyone been to see
Mr. Tolmachoff recently?

185
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,714
Yes, just five minutes ago.
A fairly tall man.

186
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,757
Christ Almighty!

187
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:15,137
"Accessory to murder" -
mean anything to you?

188
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:49,504
The Harder They Fall

189
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,340
Bogey...

190
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,756
- I saw a man die.
- How'd he die?

191
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,383
In an accident.

192
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,551
Take me out to dinner?

193
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,975
Let me make another call first.
Wait for me?

194
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,770
Call from the restaurant.

195
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,524
I'll just be a second.

196
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,903
The French always say one second
when they mean five minutes.

197
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,667
Where we going?

198
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,628
Anywhere. The Latin Quarter.

199
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,423
- Sleep with me tonight?
- I don't know.

200
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,093
- Don't you like it with me?
- Sure, I do.

201
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:05,390
I just read something neat.
About a bus conductor.

202
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:10,145
He stole five million to seduce a girl,
posing as a rich impresario.

203
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:14,274
He took her to the Riviera.
They blew the wad in three days.

204
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:18,195
The guy didn't cop out.
He told her,

205
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,656
"It's stolen money, I'm a hood,
but I like you."

206
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,914
What's great is that she stuck by him.
She said, "I like you, too."

207
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,707
They came back to Paris

208
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,002
and were nabbed trying to rob
some fancy villas.

209
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,172
She stood lookout.
That was sweet of her.

210
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,843
Excuse me, got a light?

211
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,305
Here! Go buy yourself a matchbook.

212
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,307
I totally forgot!

213
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,851
- I have an appointment.
- Who with?

214
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:54,523
A journalist on the Champs-Élysées.
We're going to a press conference.

215
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:56,107
Where? Now?

216
00:21:56,274 --> 00:22:00,570
None of your business.
You can really be annoying.

217
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,824
So you're leaving me?

218
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,992
But I'll see you tomorrow.

219
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,495
Not tomorrow.
Tonight, Patricia.

220
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,580
I told you I can't.

221
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,833
Why are you so mean?

222
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,751
Any taxis around?

223
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:18,588
I'm parked by the Opera. Want a lift?

224
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,552
What happened to the Ford?

225
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,679
It's in the garage.

226
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,181
Let me stay with you.

227
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,725
I've got a headache.

228
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,979
We won't have sex.
I just want to be with you.

229
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,523
That's not it, Michel.

230
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,574
- Why are you so sad?
- Because I am.

231
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,617
That's silly.

232
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,788
Why are you so sad?

233
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,082
Should I use "vous" or "tu"?

234
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,043
No difference.
But I can't do without you.

235
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,336
Yes, you can.

236
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,089
Maybe. But I don't want to.

237
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,679
Just look at that swell Talbot.
A 2.5 liter.

238
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,974
- You're a guy who...
- What?

239
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,852
Oh, I don't know.

240
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:17,898
Look at me.
I forbid you to meet this guy.

241
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,948
Woe is me!

242
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,784
I love a girl with a pretty neck,

243
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,871
pretty breasts, a pretty voice,

244
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,539
pretty wrists,

245
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,124
a pretty forehead,

246
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,543
and pretty knees...

247
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:45,508
But she's such a coward.

248
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,305
- It's right here. Stop.
- Let me park first.

249
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,724
Don't bother.

250
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:57,020
Get lost!

251
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,689
I never want to see you again.

252
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,650
Get lost!

253
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,613
You make me want to puke.

254
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,371
It'd be a shame
if that happened to you.

255
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,040
We'll see.

256
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:01,251
What's wrong?

257
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:06,840
If I could dig a hole
to hide in, I would.

258
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:11,970
Do like elephants do.
When they're sad...

259
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,067
Let me tell you a story.

260
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,570
It'll take your mind off things.

261
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,697
There's this girl I know.

262
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,409
The other day, I figured,
"I'll ask her to sleep with me."

263
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,996
It had never occurred to me before.
We met for lunch.

264
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:42,917
I wanted to say,
"We're friends. Let's sleep together."

265
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:47,922
I don't know why,
but it completely slipped my mind!

266
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:53,053
Later I suddenly remembered
and sent her a telegram saying:

267
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,723
"I forgot to suggest
that we sleep together."

268
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,685
Three hours later I get
a message back, saying:

269
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:03,396
"What an amazing coincidence!

270
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:06,941
I was thinking exactly the same thing!"

271
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:25,478
- This the late edition?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,515
Where's my key?

273
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:47,769
You must've left it in the door.

274
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,109
What the heck!

275
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,280
What are you doing here?

276
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,741
The Claridge was booked up.

277
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:06,162
So I came here.
I took the key downstairs.

278
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,040
There are other places
than the Claridge.

279
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,502
I always stay at the Claridge.

280
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,296
You're crazy.

281
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,632
Don't make such a face.

282
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,135
It doesn't suit you.

283
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:26,140
- What's "making a face"?
- Going like this.

284
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,858
It suits me just fine.

285
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,361
You're even crazier than me.

286
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,154
Goddammit.

287
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:45,034
I always fall for girls
who aren't my type.

288
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:50,248
Did you notice I followed you
last night? Answer me.

289
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,876
What's wrong?

290
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:57,005
Leave me alone. I'm thinking.

291
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,507
What about?

292
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:04,220
What's horrible is, I don't even know.

293
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,222
Well, I do.

294
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,766
No, nobody does.

295
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:12,353
You're thinking about last night.
Yes, you are.

296
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,692
Last night I was furious,
but now I couldn't care less.

297
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,862
I'm not thinking about anything.

298
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:29,120
I'd like to think about something,
but I can't seem to.

299
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:33,499
Well, I'm tired, very tired,

300
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,377
and I'm going back to sleep.

301
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,429
- Why are you looking at me?
- Because I am.

302
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:50,558
- You should've stayed with me.
- I couldn't.

303
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:54,812
You should've told the guy
you couldn't see him.

304
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,732
I had to.
He's getting me articles to write.

305
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,443
It's really important for me.

306
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,780
What's important
is going to Rome with me.

307
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,491
Maybe. I don't know.

308
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,327
Did you sleep with him?

309
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,413
I bet you did.

310
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,583
No. He's really sweet.

311
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,754
He said we'd sleep together
someday, but not now.

312
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,173
But he doesn't even know me.

313
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,218
Not you. Him and me.

314
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,970
We had a drink in Montparnasse.

315
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:31,682
I was there, too. At what time?

316
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,936
I don't know. We didn't stay long.

317
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:39,107
Why'd you come here, Michel?

318
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:43,236
Because I want to sleep
with you again.

319
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:46,114
That's hardly a reason.

320
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,117
Sure it is. It means I love you.

321
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,620
But I don't know if I love you yet.

322
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,790
When will you know?

323
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,834
Soon.

324
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:01,879
What's that mean, "soon"?
In a month, a year?

325
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:04,799
Soon means soon.

326
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:07,760
A woman will never do in eight seconds

327
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:11,222
what she'll gladly do eight days later.

328
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:14,892
It's all the same,
eight seconds or eight days.

329
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,603
Why not eight centuries?

330
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,731
No, eight days is fine.

331
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:25,111
Women always do things halfway.

332
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,613
It gets me down.

333
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,368
Why won't you sleep with me?

334
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:35,079
Because I'm trying to find out

335
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:39,167
what it is that I like about you.

336
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:42,170
I want us to be
like Romeo and Juliet.

337
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,839
That's just like a girl!

338
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:50,720
See? You said last night you couldn't
live without me, but you can.

339
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:55,349
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet,
but you can.

340
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:59,687
No, I can't live without you.

341
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,483
That's just like a guy!

342
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,526
Give me a smile.

343
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,364
I'll count to eight.

344
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:14,994
If by eight you haven't smiled,
I'll strangle you.

345
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,039
Two...

346
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,041
Three...

347
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,084
Four, five, six...

348
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,128
Seven...

349
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,380
Seven and a half...

350
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:29,050
Seven and three quarters.

351
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,887
You're such a coward.
I bet you're gonna smile.

352
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:40,895
Enough games for today.

353
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,025
You're a coward. Too bad.

354
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,902
Why do you say that?

355
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,445
You get on my nerves.

356
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,489
You do, too.

357
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,241
I'm not a coward.

358
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,243
What makes you think I'm scared?

359
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:59,330
If a girl says everything's fine
then can't even light her cigarette,

360
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:02,291
it means she's scared of something.

361
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,503
I don't know of what, but she's scared.

362
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,756
Have one.

363
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:11,175
None of those Chesterfields.

364
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:14,053
Hand me my jacket.

365
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,430
- This pocket?
- Give!

366
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,518
This your passport?

367
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,979
No, my brother's. Mine's in the car.

368
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,648
But it says Kovács here.

369
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:28,859
Oh, yeah? He's not my real brother.

370
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:32,989
My mom was divorced
by the time he was born.

371
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,584
See? I'm not scared.

372
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,628
- I never said you were.
- You bet, pet.

373
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:55,720
But you wish you'd said it.
And now you're annoyed. You can't.

374
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,556
I'm not talking to you anymore.

375
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,148
Do you ever think about death?

376
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,942
I do, all the time.

377
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:13,654
What?

378
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,490
Say something nice.

379
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:17,950
Like what?

380
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,869
I don't know.

381
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,163
Then neither do I.

382
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,501
I like your ashtray.

383
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,587
It's Swiss.

384
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,716
My granddad had a Rolls-Royce.
Great car!

385
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:37,136
Never had to raise the hood
in 15 years!

386
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,974
Seen my new poster?

387
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,019
Come here!

388
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,606
Come here, for chrissake!

389
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:52,526
It won't do here. Where can I hang it?

390
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,865
Why'd you slap me
when I looked at your legs?

391
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:00,368
It wasn't my legs.

392
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,538
It's exactly the same thing.

393
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:09,710
The French always say things
are the same when they're not at all.

394
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,422
I've thought of something nice.

395
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,091
What?

396
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:19,887
I want to sleep with you again
because you're beautiful.

397
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,473
I'm not.

398
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,266
Then because you're ugly.

399
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,310
Is it the same?

400
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,735
Yeah, kid, it's the same.

401
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,445
You're a liar, Michel.

402
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,698
No, lying's stupid.

403
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:42,284
It's like with poker.
It's better to tell the truth.

404
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:46,706
The others think you're bluffing,
and that's how you win.

405
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:48,582
What's wrong?

406
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:56,465
I'll stare at you
until you stop staring at me.

407
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,092
Me, too.

408
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:28,831
I'll hang my poster in the bathroom.

409
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:31,834
Can I make a call?

410
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,549
It's not bad here.

411
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,968
Just fine.

412
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,184
You like this poster?

413
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,020
It's okay.

414
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,274
Renoir's a really great painter.

415
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,651
I said, it's okay!

416
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,822
Think she's prettier than me?

417
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,997
When you're scared or surprised,
or both at once,

418
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,041
there's a funny glint in your eyes.

419
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,375
So what?

420
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:17,379
I wanna sleep with you again,
because of that glint.

421
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,845
Mind if I piss in the sink?

422
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,848
Guess what I'm going to say.

423
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:30,017
No idea.

424
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:33,103
I'm pregnant, Michel.

425
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,193
You heard me.

426
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,861
Whose is it? Mine?

427
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,030
I think so.

428
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,282
Have you seen a doctor?

429
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,368
Yesterday.

430
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:51,455
I have to go back Thursday
for the tests.

431
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:53,958
You should've been more careful!

432
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:12,268
Get me Élysées 9984.

433
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,192
Is Antonio there?

434
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:25,114
You don't know if he's coming back?

435
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,908
I'll call again.

436
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,754
Élysées 2532.

437
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,176
I'm calling the guy
who owes me money.

438
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,724
Mr. Tolmachoff, please.

439
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,436
Hey, sonny.

440
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,651
I couldn't find Berruti.

441
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,947
I wandered
around Montparnasse all night.

442
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:11,619
The police?

443
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:17,124
Thanks. Ciao, sonny.

444
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,128
Shit!

445
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:23,505
- What?
- I slipped.

446
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,134
Heard the one
about the condemned man?

447
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:33,849
As he's climbing the scaffold,
he slips and says, "That figures!"

448
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:42,775
Up close, you look like a Martian.

449
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,819
Because my head's in the clouds.

450
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,988
Some idea, having a kid!

451
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,907
But it's not sure.

452
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:52,326
I wanted to see what you'd say.

453
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:55,496
- Take your clothes off.
- What for?

454
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:57,665
You Americans are so dumb.

455
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,208
I don't see why.

456
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,045
You adore La Fayette
and Maurice Chevalier.

457
00:41:03,212 --> 00:41:06,674
And they're the dumbest French!

458
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,218
I'm making another call.

459
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:13,389
Belle Épine 35 26.

460
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,766
Patricia, come here!

461
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:21,438
Mr. Mansard?

462
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:26,276
Will he be in this afternoon?
Tell him I'll come by.

463
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:31,115
I'm a friend of Tony's.
From Marseilles.

464
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,910
I've got an American.

465
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,038
An American?

466
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,999
László Kovács.

467
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:47,673
Not you. My American car.

468
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:56,056
I can't reach the guy
who owes me. What a drag!

469
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,892
Do you prefer records or the radio?

470
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,603
Quiet, I'm thinking.

471
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,790
I know them all by heart.

472
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,752
- How old are you?
- I'll put the radio on.

473
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,420
I'm 20.

474
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,547
You don't look it.

475
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,925
Why don't you like music?

476
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,136
It depends what kind.

477
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:37,139
Come on, Patricia, come to Italy.

478
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:45,147
What's the point of studying
at the Sorbonne?

479
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:48,192
You never took any exams.

480
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:52,613
Sure, the baccalaureate.
Then I packed it in.

481
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,531
What's "packed it in"?

482
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,283
I did other stuff.

483
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,576
Like what?

484
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,036
I sold cars.

485
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:00,996
Here, in Paris?

486
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,793
In New York.

487
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:09,630
You slept with a lot of guys?

488
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:11,590
Not all that many.

489
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:15,761
How many?

490
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:19,473
How about you?

491
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,020
Not so many either.

492
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:30,275
Know where I'd like to live? Mexico.

493
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,319
I hear it's really great.

494
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:36,949
When I was a kid my dad would say,
"We'll go next Saturday."

495
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:39,618
But he'd always forget.

496
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:44,164
No, Mexico doesn't grab me.

497
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,625
I bet it's not all that great.

498
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,169
People are such liars.

499
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:52,339
It's like Stockholm. You keep hearing,

500
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:57,636
"Swedish girls are terrific.
I laid three a day. Go."

501
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:00,806
I went. It's not true.

502
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:04,476
Swedish girls don't act
the way they do here.

503
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:07,855
And most of them are dogs
like Parisian girls.

504
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:11,233
No, Swedish girls are very pretty.

505
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,570
It's a myth.

506
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:21,201
One or two maybe, just like in Paris
or London, but not all of them.

507
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:24,580
The cities where the girls are pretty,

508
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:28,876
not gorgeous,
but like you, charming,

509
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:33,213
girls who rate eight on a scale of 10,

510
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,049
because they have a certain something...

511
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:43,515
aren't Rome or Paris or Rio,
but Lausanne and Geneva.

512
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:48,061
Say something nice, too.

513
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,898
I don't know what, either.

514
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:59,114
Would you let another guy caress you?

515
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:08,081
You know, you said I'm scared.
It's true, I'm scared.

516
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:11,126
Because I want you to love me.

517
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:16,924
But at the same time,
I want you to stop loving me.

518
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,135
I'm very independent, you know.

519
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:26,600
I love you, but not the way you think.

520
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:28,352
Then how?

521
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:29,811
Not the way you think.

522
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:34,107
But you don't know what I think.
You don't know.

523
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:37,569
- Sure I do.
- No. You can't.

524
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:42,157
I want to know what's behind your face.

525
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:48,956
I've looked at it for 10 minutes now,
and I still know nothing, nothing.

526
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:51,375
I'm not sad, but I'm scared.

527
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,629
Sweet, gentle Patricia.

528
00:45:55,796 --> 00:46:02,302
Then mean, stupid, heartless,
pathetic, cowardly, despicable.

529
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:07,599
You don't even know
how to put on your lipstick.

530
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,309
Now you're hideous.

531
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:12,646
Say what you like, I don't care.

532
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:15,274
I'll put all this in my book.

533
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,485
- What book?
- I'm writing a novel.

534
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:21,196
- You?
- Why shouldn't I?

535
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:22,656
What are you doing?

536
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,157
Taking off your top.

537
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:25,951
Not now.

538
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:29,496
You're a pain! What is all this?

539
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:33,166
You know William Faulkner?

540
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,545
No, who's he?
Someone you slept with?

541
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:39,089
Hardly, sweetie pie.

542
00:46:39,256 --> 00:46:41,133
Then he can go to hell!

543
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,592
Take off your top.

544
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:46,555
He's one of my favorite writers.
Have you read <i>The Wild Palms</i>?

545
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:48,807
I said no! Take off your top.

546
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:53,020
Listen. The last sentence is beautiful.

547
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:06,700
Which would you choose?

548
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,452
Let me see your toes.

549
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:11,872
Toes are important in a woman.
Don't laugh.

550
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:14,166
Which would you choose?

551
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,710
Grief's stupid.

552
00:47:17,252 --> 00:47:19,004
I'd choose nothing.

553
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:20,881
It's not better...

554
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,884
but grief's a compromise.

555
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:25,886
I want all or nothing.

556
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:28,180
And now I know.

557
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:32,392
That's it.
Why are you shutting your eyes?

558
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,438
I'm shutting them tight
so everything goes black.

559
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:40,442
But I can't do it.
It's never entirely black.

560
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:42,444
Your smile...

561
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:46,865
seen in profile,
is the nicest thing about you.

562
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:48,909
That's you.

563
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,911
That's me!

564
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:05,092
We look each other in the eyes,
but what for?

565
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:13,975
I hate that name.
I'd like to be called Ingrid.

566
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:18,021
Sit on your haunches.

567
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,234
What's wrong?

568
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,196
I'm looking at you.

569
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:28,907
The French are stupid too.

570
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,501
I want you to stay with me.

571
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:47,509
<i>We interrupt our programming
to synchronize our transceivers.</i>

572
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:57,853
Funny... I can see myself in your eyes.

573
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:01,189
This is Franco-American
rapprochement.

574
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:03,900
We hide like happy elephants.

575
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,694
A woman's hips are touching.

576
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:07,946
It's hot under here.

577
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:25,213
If it was another man caressing you,
would you mind?

578
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,840
You asked me that.

579
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:31,219
<i>And now ifs time for</i>
Music While You Work...

580
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,575
So that's that.

581
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:10,050
Do you know a book by Dylan Thomas,
<i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog?</i>

582
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:16,556
<i>On Sunday morning,
It's most satisfyin'</i>

583
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:19,142
<i>To enjoy a long lie-in</i>

584
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,771
I'm getting dressed.

585
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,814
What time is it?

586
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:26,608
Noon.

587
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:28,860
Was it good?

588
00:50:31,488 --> 00:50:32,906
Let's stay in bed.

589
00:50:33,073 --> 00:50:35,617
Nope, I have to buy a dress.

590
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:36,952
Got your car?

591
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,621
My car? Sure.

592
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:55,971
Élysées 9984.

593
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:09,025
Did Antonio come by?

594
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:15,073
This is maddening!

595
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:18,076
You don't know where he is?

596
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:21,454
No, never mind.

597
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:24,332
Michel Poiccard again.

598
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,335
Want me to wear a bra?

599
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,431
Do you prefer my eyes,
my mouth or my shoulders?

600
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:43,435
If you had to choose?

601
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,984
There is no press conference?

602
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:54,279
There is. At Orly airport.

603
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:59,826
I'm not much of a looker,
but I'm quite a boxer.

604
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,499
Going to your press conference?

605
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,336
I have to drop by the office first.

606
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:11,046
I'll come with you.

607
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,340
<i>President Eisenhower,
with General De Gaulle,</i>

608
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:17,427
<i>will lay a wreath
on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</i>

609
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,012
Were you in the army?

610
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,058
What did you do?

611
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:25,727
I bumped off sentries.

612
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:27,187
"Bumped off"?

613
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:28,855
I laid them out like this.

614
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:31,024
Don't, Michel!

615
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:37,530
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna die.

616
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:39,532
You're crazy.

617
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:42,577
Yeah, totally bonkers.

618
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:44,746
What's "bonkers"?

619
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:46,539
That's me.

620
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:07,727
Your car's not here?

621
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:13,316
It's at the garage.
I'll go pick it up now.

622
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:38,591
Swell, a Ford!

623
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:51,813
- What floor?
- Sixth.

624
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,793
I got the wrong floor.

625
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:48,745
- Are you scared of aging? I am.
- You dope!

626
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:55,376
I told you,
the worst flaw is cowardice.

627
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,465
Buy me a dress at Dior?

628
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:04,677
No way! There are
nicer ones at the five-and-ten.

629
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:07,597
You don't buy dresses at Dior,
you make calls.

630
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:10,391
It's the only place
where you can call for free.

631
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:13,102
There are 12 phone booths.

632
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,146
<i>France-soir!</i>

633
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:31,704
Thank you, sir.

634
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:45,218
POLICE KILLER STILL AT LARGE

635
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,389
How long will it last?

636
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:33,182
Half an hour or so.

637
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:35,852
I'll go see my man, then.

638
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:59,709
Why did you call your novel <i>Candida?</i>

639
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:04,797
I'm convinced that the French
will give my book

640
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:08,968
a cool reception
because of their prudishness.

641
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:11,137
Mr. Parvulesco!

642
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:17,852
Can one still believe in love in our time?

643
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:23,149
Of course, especially in our time.

644
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:30,156
Was Rilke right to say, "Modern life will
increasingly separate men and women"?

645
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:34,702
Rilke was a great poet,
so he was probably right.

646
00:57:37,664 --> 00:57:39,332
Out of my way!

647
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,418
You and your Pathé-Journal!

648
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:50,802
Are French women romantically
different from American women?

649
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,595
French women

650
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:54,722
are totally unlike American women.

651
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,808
The American woman
dominates the man.

652
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:59,686
The French woman
doesn't dominate him yet.

653
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,441
What's your greatest ambition in life?

654
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:09,696
Which is more moral: an unfaithful woman
or a man who walks out?

655
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:12,657
An unfaithful woman.

656
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:16,536
Are women more sentimental
than men?

657
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:20,373
Feelings are a luxury
few women indulge in.

658
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,797
Is there a difference
between eroticism and love?

659
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:32,760
No, not really.

660
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:35,972
I don't think so, because...

661
00:58:36,139 --> 00:58:39,600
eroticism is a form of love,
and vice versa.

662
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:43,229
Does the soul exist in modern society?

663
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:52,905
Do women have a role to play
in modern society?

664
00:58:54,073 --> 00:58:58,411
If they're charming and wear
striped dresses and dark glasses.

665
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:01,205
Casanova said that there's no woman

666
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:04,000
who can't be seduced
with displays of gratitude.

667
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:07,086
See Cocteau's
<i>Testament of Orpheus.</i>

668
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:10,923
How many men can a woman
love in a lifetime?

669
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,092
Physically, I mean.

670
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:19,515
More than that.

671
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:22,351
Miss, you're in the frame.

672
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:28,357
Two things matter in life. For men,
it's women, and for women, money.

673
00:59:28,524 --> 00:59:30,276
See? You are a pessimist.

674
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:33,488
If you see a pretty girl
with a rich man, you know

675
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:36,783
she's nice and he's a bastard.

676
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,039
Do you like Brahms?

677
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:44,499
Like everyone, no.

678
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,334
- And Chopin?
- Makes me want to puke!

679
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:50,296
What's your greatest ambition?

680
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:58,513
To become immortal, and then die.

681
01:00:41,973 --> 01:00:43,683
You Claudius Mansard?

682
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,768
Yes, Mr. Kovács.

683
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,605
I called this morning.
I was told you'd be in.

684
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:51,399
Yes, Mr. Kovács.

685
01:00:51,566 --> 01:00:53,651
Tony sent me.

686
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:57,738
Didn't we meet in Nice?

687
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:01,742
Nobody phoned you?

688
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:05,329
Yes. But they said
it'd be an Oldsmobile.

689
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:08,040
It fell through at the last minute.

690
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,834
So?

691
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:12,295
So it's this one.

692
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,225
800,000.

693
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:32,481
But I can't pay you till next week.

694
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:34,108
You're a bastard!

695
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:39,155
And you, Mr. Kovács? What are you?

696
01:01:41,324 --> 01:01:42,867
So what?

697
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:46,078
So you don't get the money now.

698
01:01:46,245 --> 01:01:49,665
- Tough. Is it 3:00 yet?
- Quarter past.

699
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,876
Can I use your phone?

700
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:11,354
- Is Antonio there?
<i>- He just left.</i>

701
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,314
Goddammit!

702
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:16,317
<i>He said to meet him at L'Escale at 4:00.</i>

703
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:20,488
Four o'clock at L'Escale. Okay, thanks.

704
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:26,494
Don't bother. I carry my cash on me.

705
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,788
Lend me 10,000.

706
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:32,625
5,000.

707
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:36,003
2,500.

708
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:43,803
It's not running?

709
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:48,266
Hey, you!

710
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,103
You remove the distributor cap?

711
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:56,899
Pay for the call!

712
01:02:57,066 --> 01:02:58,651
Pay for my taxi!

713
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:02,405
Step on it! Step on it!

714
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:05,700
Never mind the pedestrians!
Just move it!

715
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:08,494
Step on it, for chrissake!

716
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:14,208
The Thunderbird's fender torn off!
Me, not a scratch!

717
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:18,045
That's where I was born.

718
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:21,340
Look at the eyesore
they built opposite!

719
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:26,846
Buildings like that get me down.
They ruin the block.

720
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,268
I have a feeling for beauty, beautiful.

721
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:36,480
Go through Chatelet.
It's your fault if we're late.

722
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,190
No, it isn't.

723
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:40,234
Pass that Peugeot!

724
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:41,777
Don't shift gears!

725
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:47,408
Braking for a 4CV!
That scooter just passed you!

726
01:03:47,575 --> 01:03:49,744
Take the next left.

727
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:51,912
Stop here. Be right back.

728
01:04:22,026 --> 01:04:23,986
He left five minutes ago.

729
01:04:24,153 --> 01:04:26,697
The friend who owes you money?

730
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:30,701
Antonio Berruti, yeah. It's your fault.

731
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,204
Now it's double or nothing.

732
01:04:33,371 --> 01:04:35,748
- Why?
- Later.

733
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:37,917
Pass that 2CV, pops.

734
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:40,628
- Where you going?
- To the <i>Herald</i>.

735
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:42,213
Eyes on the road!

736
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,798
Why bother writing?

737
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:47,510
To have money and not rely on men.

738
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:51,180
Parisians look like tarts
in those short dresses.

739
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:55,101
Makes me wanna run up behind them
and do like this...

740
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:57,311
Don't mind me!

741
01:04:57,478 --> 01:04:58,729
Stop here!

742
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,740
- Be right back.
- Okay.

743
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,034
- Not paying?
- Quick!

744
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:22,878
- Where are we going?
- The Champs-Élysées.

745
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,632
I hate cabbies who worry
about scratching the bodywork.

746
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:29,468
The Gestapo put up a wall here

747
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:31,720
so nobody could get away.

748
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:34,265
I've been thinking about that girl.

749
01:05:34,432 --> 01:05:35,558
What girl?

750
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:39,019
The one with that guy on the Riviera.

751
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:41,564
You said you admired her.

752
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:45,484
Yeah, a normal girl. That's rare.

753
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,239
Come with me to the paper?

754
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,158
No, I have a call to make.

755
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:55,494
I'm going to see my tailor.
I'll pick you up later.

756
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,580
Ciao, kiddo!

757
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,518
You're late. They're waiting.

758
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,592
Over there.

759
01:07:09,652 --> 01:07:10,986
You speak French?

760
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:13,822
You know this man?

761
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:36,095
Careful, kid.
You can't fool the Paris police.

762
01:07:36,262 --> 01:07:38,013
Yes, it's Michel.

763
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:43,435
I didn't recognize him.
It's an old photo.

764
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:47,898
You were seen with him
this morning just outside.

765
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:49,066
Who saw me?

766
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:53,779
He was driving
a Ford Thunderbird 3382 GM75.

767
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:57,032
Where is he now?

768
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,285
I don't know.

769
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:04,081
Watch what you say, kid.

770
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:06,709
I've seen him five or six times.

771
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:11,839
I found him nice. I don't know
where he lives or what he does.

772
01:08:12,423 --> 01:08:14,842
Known him long?

773
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:20,139
I met him in Nice last month.
I was on vacation.

774
01:08:20,306 --> 01:08:24,143
He came to Paris to see someone
who owes him money.

775
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,311
Who?

776
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:28,647
I don't know.
He had an Italian name.

777
01:08:30,316 --> 01:08:32,901
Think you'll see him again?

778
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:39,158
Maybe. Sometimes he calls me
and asks me out. Like this morning.

779
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,872
Got a work permit?

780
01:08:45,998 --> 01:08:48,375
You don't want any passport problems?

781
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:49,543
No, I don't.

782
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:53,213
So if you see him, here's my number.

783
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:59,678
Danton 01 00.

784
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:50,724
<i>President Eisenhower
is waving to the crowds...</i>

785
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:59,024
Was that what you meant
by double or nothing?

786
01:12:00,526 --> 01:12:02,152
More or less.

787
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:04,071
Let's go see a Western.

788
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:07,074
Yeah, better wait till dark.

789
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,421
<i>Beware, Jessica</i>

790
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:24,007
<i>On the kiss's beveled edge
Time is a void</i>

791
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:27,886
<i>Avoid, avoid
Memory's broken pledge</i>

792
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,683
<i>You're wrong, sheriff</i>

793
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:36,144
<i>Your tale is noble and tragic
Like the mask of a tyrant</i>

794
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:40,983
<i>No drama so perilous or magnetic
No detail can make our love pathetic</i>

795
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,494
Hey, cutie!

796
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:06,967
POLICE CLOSING IN ON MICHEL POICCARD...

797
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:09,845
- What's it say?
- I'm reading it.

798
01:13:10,012 --> 01:13:12,097
The cops are stupid to be after me.

799
01:13:12,264 --> 01:13:15,350
I'm one of the few people
who likes cops.

800
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:20,147
Let me caress you.

801
01:13:21,148 --> 01:13:22,274
Say something!

802
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:24,484
- Wow!
- What?

803
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:27,279
- So you're married.
- Show me.

804
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:33,035
That was ages ago.

805
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:35,787
She was a wacko. She dumped me.

806
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:37,873
Or I dumped her. Don't remember.

807
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,626
I'm really fond of you.

808
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:43,795
What's it feel like,
riding in a stolen car?

809
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,840
- And killing a policeman?
- I was scared.

810
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,217
How did they know I knew you?

811
01:13:49,384 --> 01:13:53,221
Someone must've seen us together
and informed on us.

812
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:55,766
- That's horrible.
- What is?

813
01:13:55,933 --> 01:13:58,018
Informing on people.

814
01:13:58,185 --> 01:14:01,355
No, it's normal. Informers inform,

815
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:03,023
burglars burgle,

816
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:07,569
murderers murder, lovers love.

817
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:13,533
Look, isn't the Concorde gorgeous!

818
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,956
Yes, mysterious, with all the lights.

819
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:22,918
I was a fool to keep this car.
Gotta switch.

820
01:14:23,085 --> 01:14:25,087
- What?
- Switch cars.

821
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:41,436
Let's steal the Cadillac?

822
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:45,941
What about the keys?

823
01:14:46,108 --> 01:14:50,362
You drive, I hide.
They leave the keys in the car here.

824
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:58,996
- What do I tell the man?
- Say good night, in English.

825
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:02,874
That'll shut him up.
The French are yellow-bellied.

826
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,334
"Yellow-bellied"?

827
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:07,212
Scared stiff. You scared?

828
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:10,382
It's too late to be scared.

829
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:27,190
MICHEL POICCARD: ARREST IMMINENT

830
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:38,744
I just gotta find Antonio.

831
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:42,414
Once you look for someone,
you never find him.

832
01:15:47,002 --> 01:15:48,462
Who was that?

833
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:51,590
- Step on it, poppet.
- What's "poppet"?

834
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:14,029
Have you seen Antonio?

835
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:16,615
I'll tell you if I can kiss her.

836
01:16:17,532 --> 01:16:19,618
It's not up to me.

837
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,287
It's up to her.

838
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,627
He's with Zumbach.

839
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,589
Carl!

840
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:40,222
- How's life?
- The same. Antonio here?

841
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:42,974
There he is.

842
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,978
- Who is he?
- Antonio?

843
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:48,105
No, the other one.

844
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,528
Let's see those socks.

845
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,114
Silk socks with a tweed jacket!

846
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,866
- I like silk.
- Not with tweed!

847
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:03,829
- Hey, amigo.
- Hey, sonny.

848
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:05,539
I'll be off.

849
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:09,584
You been looking for me?
You called several times.

850
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:13,338
Yeah, I'm in the shit. Goddammit!

851
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:15,882
Got a minute?

852
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:17,801
- See that guy?
- What do I say?

853
01:17:17,968 --> 01:17:19,511
Anything you want.

854
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:21,680
I'll just be a sec.

855
01:17:22,097 --> 01:17:26,017
- What will they do?
- Take photos of her kissing the guy.

856
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:29,437
- What for?
- Blackmail, probably.

857
01:17:49,124 --> 01:17:50,876
Be right back.

858
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:53,461
Who's the chick?

859
01:17:53,628 --> 01:17:56,840
- To make things worse, I love her.
- Damn!

860
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:20,030
1.3 million. Can do.

861
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,032
What's the bank?

862
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:24,409
- B.N.C.I.
- Let me see.

863
01:18:27,454 --> 01:18:28,705
What do we do?

864
01:18:28,872 --> 01:18:30,373
Don't know.

865
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,585
- Where can I reach you tomorrow?
- Don't know.

866
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:36,755
The hotels are crawling with
goddamn tourists.

867
01:18:36,922 --> 01:18:39,424
My friend in Montmartre
has a big place.

868
01:18:39,591 --> 01:18:42,928
- Not Montmartre.
- Not Montmartre, he says.

869
01:18:43,094 --> 01:18:44,471
Why not?

870
01:18:44,638 --> 01:18:47,265
Too many enemies in Montmartre.

871
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:49,601
Try Zumbach's Swedish girl.

872
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:52,604
Rue Campagne-Première?

873
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:54,814
Call me there tomorrow.

874
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,960
Antonio said we could sleep here.

875
01:19:15,126 --> 01:19:19,005
Sure. Sit down.
I'll be right with you.

876
01:19:24,636 --> 01:19:26,137
Smile!

877
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,892
Why not pose? Pay's good.

878
01:19:31,518 --> 01:19:33,478
You have to sleep around.

879
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,273
I was just thinking...

880
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:39,276
- What?
- I'm not sure.

881
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,194
About?

882
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:45,282
I don't know. Otherwise I'd be sure.

883
01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:54,332
You dump your journalist?

884
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,668
Why'd you say hello?

885
01:19:57,127 --> 01:19:59,921
To make sure
I didn't love him anymore.

886
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:02,340
You complicate your life.

887
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:05,510
That's it.
Drop me on the Champs-Élysées?

888
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:24,029
What are you playing?

889
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:29,034
The "Clarinet Concerto" by Mozart.
Do you mind?

890
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,785
No, I like that one.

891
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:33,705
I thought you didn't like music.

892
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:37,292
This one's okay.
My dad was a clarinetist.

893
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:41,379
My dad was a great clarinet player.

894
01:20:42,047 --> 01:20:44,215
Want to go to bed?

895
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,384
Sleeping's so sad.

896
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:48,136
We have to separ.

897
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:51,264
- ...ate.
- "Separate."

898
01:20:52,307 --> 01:20:55,435
You say "sleep together," but you don't.

899
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:10,116
What is it?

900
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:15,830
Nothing.

901
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:21,836
Come here.

902
01:21:30,929 --> 01:21:33,723
Go buy a <i>France-soir</i>
and a bottle of milk.

903
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:43,274
What time is it?

904
01:21:43,608 --> 01:21:45,318
Five o'clock.

905
01:21:50,365 --> 01:21:52,409
Still busy.

906
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,460
- What?
- Nothing.

907
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:04,087
<i>France-soir!</i>

908
01:22:04,254 --> 01:22:06,214
I'm looking at you.

909
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:14,472
It's your lucky day. Buy a ticket.

910
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,141
- A Scotch.
- Don't have any.

911
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,101
Make it coffee.

912
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:25,316
Danton 01 00?

913
01:22:26,693 --> 01:22:29,654
Inspector Vital, please.

914
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:40,081
Patricia Franchini.

915
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:45,003
I've just seen the man
you've been looking for.

916
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:48,923
He's at 11, rue Première-Campagne.

917
01:22:50,341 --> 01:22:53,178
Yes. 11, rue Campagne-Première.

918
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:49,984
Thirsty?

919
01:23:51,569 --> 01:23:55,073
Antonio's coming. He just called.

920
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,867
We're going to Italy, kid.

921
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,621
I can't go.

922
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:04,040
Sure you can. I'm taking you.

923
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:07,001
Berruti's lending me his Simca Sport.

924
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:12,507
- A Gordini engine.
- Michel, I called the police.

925
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:14,592
I said you were here.

926
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:17,428
What! Are you crazy?

927
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:20,473
No, I'm fine.

928
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,185
No, I'm not fine.

929
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:27,272
I don't want to go away
with you now.

930
01:24:27,605 --> 01:24:29,232
I knew it.

931
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:30,942
I don't know.

932
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:34,571
I just talked about myself,
and you, yourself.

933
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:36,114
I'm so stupid.

934
01:24:36,281 --> 01:24:40,118
You should've talked about me,
and me, about you.

935
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:43,246
I don't want to be in love with you.

936
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:47,792
That's why I called the police.

937
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:54,299
I stayed with you
to make sure I was in love with you.

938
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:57,343
Or that I wasn't.

939
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:02,807
And since I'm being mean to you,

940
01:25:02,974 --> 01:25:05,810
it proves I'm not in love with you.

941
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,729
Say that again!

942
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:11,858
And since I'm being mean to you,

943
01:25:12,025 --> 01:25:15,361
it proves I'm not in love with you.

944
01:25:16,863 --> 01:25:19,365
They say there's no happy love.

945
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:21,909
If I loved you...

946
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,871
It's too complicated!

947
01:25:25,038 --> 01:25:28,833
On the contrary, there's no unhappy love.

948
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:32,837
I want people to let me be.

949
01:25:33,338 --> 01:25:35,048
I'm independent.

950
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:39,344
- Maybe you love me.
- You think you are. You're not.

951
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,721
That's why I turned you in.

952
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:44,265
I'm better than you are.

953
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:48,019
Now you have no choice but to go.

954
01:25:49,604 --> 01:25:51,648
You're crazy!

955
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:55,985
That's a pathetic argument.

956
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:05,995
You're like the girl
who sleeps with everyone...

957
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:10,458
except the one man who loves her...

958
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:14,962
saying it's because she sleeps
with everyone.

959
01:26:17,632 --> 01:26:20,051
Why don't you go?

960
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:27,016
I've slept with lots of men.
Don't count on me.

961
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:30,895
What are you waiting for?

962
01:26:31,062 --> 01:26:33,439
No, I'm staying. I'm in bad shape.

963
01:26:33,606 --> 01:26:36,067
I prefer prison.

964
01:26:36,234 --> 01:26:38,069
You're mad!

965
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:44,742
Nobody'll talk to me.

966
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:47,120
I can look at the walls.

967
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:49,956
Damn, Berruti!

968
01:26:51,582 --> 01:26:54,210
Hey, amigo! I'll just park.

969
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:59,507
- The cops are coming.
- Your money!

970
01:26:59,674 --> 01:27:02,051
The American girl turned me in.

971
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:04,011
- Get in!
- No, you go!

972
01:27:04,178 --> 01:27:07,557
- Get in!
- No, I'm staying.

973
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:12,770
I'm fed up.

974
01:27:12,979 --> 01:27:14,522
I'm tired.

975
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:16,107
I want to sleep.

976
01:27:16,274 --> 01:27:17,775
You're nuts!

977
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:20,570
Damn the police. I'll save my neck.

978
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:26,200
I shouldn't be thinking of her
but I can't help it.

979
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:28,578
Want my pistol?

980
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:34,000
- Don't be stupid!
- Get lost!

981
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:39,500
Makes me want to puke.

982
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:53,431
What did he say?

983
01:29:53,598 --> 01:29:56,934
He said you make him want to puke.

984
01:30:01,731 --> 01:30:04,483
What's that mean, "puke"?
