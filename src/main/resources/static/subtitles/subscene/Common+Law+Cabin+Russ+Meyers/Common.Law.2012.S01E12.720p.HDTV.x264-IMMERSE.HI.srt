00:00:01,306 --> 00:00:03,808
(screaming)

2
00:00:05,844 --> 00:00:07,678
(coughing)

3
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:12,083
Good.
No, no, great.

4
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:13,217
Wes,

5
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:14,552
you go.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,053
Take a deep breath.

7
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:18,189
Let every ounce of rage
bubble to the surface,

8
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:22,226
then let it all out
with one big, primal scream.

9
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,334
(inhales)

10
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:34,772
No.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,240
This is your birth mother.

12
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:41,379
This, this is
your old therapist,

13
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:43,247
who strung you along

14
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:45,450
and then kicked you
out of her group.

15
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,921
Don't know if I'd put it
that way, but okay.

16
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:51,189
Crumple 'em up.

17
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:52,557
Wad them into a ball.

18
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:54,492
Then rip them into pieces
until you have confetti

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,595
for people to throw on you
at your "Travis Is Awesome,

20
00:00:57,663 --> 00:01:00,231
And You Don't Need Any Woman
To Validate You" parade.

21
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:05,570
No.

22
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:11,108
Today, we're gonna go
through my ex-wife's files.

23
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:14,946
We're gonna be looking for
accounting irregularities.

24
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:16,214
WES:
Excuse me?

25
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:18,749
What is the therapeutic value
of this, exactly?

26
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,657
We're just helping you
with your divorce.

27
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:22,548
The value is
confronting your feelings

28
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:25,216
when you come upon a written
record of mendacity and deceit.

29
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,981
A forensic accountant is just
a fancy name for somebody

30
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,817
who can read a spreadsheet.
$200 an hour, my ass.

31
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:33,253
In this room, we say no to
the divorce industrial complex.

32
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:35,522
In this room,

33
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:37,757
we go through
the files ourselves.

34
00:01:37,825 --> 00:01:38,992
No.

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,827
Absolutely not.

36
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:49,002
Could I talk to you two guys
for a second?

37
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,737
Rest of you dive in.

38
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:55,508
(exhales)

39
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,547
You know, I thought
it might be fun

40
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:02,982
to have a couple
cool cops around.

41
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,685
But we have to face facts:
you two suck at therapy.

42
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:07,087
We suck?
Yeah. You keep resisting my methods,

43
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:09,522
and I'll tell you
something else:

44
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,157
you really bring the energy
in the room down.

45
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:13,093
I-I don't want you here anymore.
We can't get

46
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,394
kicked out of another group.

47
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:15,929
I'm not throwing you out.
You've just seen

48
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:17,364
some things; there's
a couple new techniques

49
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:18,631
I don't want getting around.

50
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,234
So, I'm offering you
the deal of a lifetime.

51
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:23,036
You don't have to show up
anymore.

52
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,604
Couple months, I'll
call up your captain,

53
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:25,739
tell him your all better.

54
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,475
End of therapy.

55
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,710
Come on, guys.
It's a win-win.

56
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,393
TRAVIS: So, how much you think
these guys get

57
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,328
for robbing a food truck?

58
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:49,996
Well, I think they robbed
three in the last two months.

59
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:51,898
They must be making
some kind of money at it.

60
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,967
(Travis exhales)

61
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,069
So, this is good.

62
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:57,437
Hmm?
Huh?

63
00:02:57,505 --> 00:02:59,906
We don't have to show up
for therapy anymore.

64
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,241
Oh, heck, yeah.
(chuckles)

65
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:02,275
Of course, it's good.

66
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:04,310
I mean, you and me?

67
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:06,045
We're doing better, baby.

68
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:07,680
We're doing so much better.
Yeah.

69
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:09,315
Doing way better.
I feel great.

70
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:12,252
I feel... healed.

71
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,088
Feel much better.

72
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:17,290
It's just,

73
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:18,625
you know,

74
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:22,128
Pack-Man's birthday
is a few days away.

75
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:26,099
You think I don't know that?
I've been thinking

76
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,501
about it, man.

77
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,372
I-I just... I wouldn't mind
talking to Dr. Ryan about it.

78
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,507
Well, we don't have
that option, Travis.

79
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:36,709
Pack-Man's birthday-- it's gonna
come, and it's gonna go,

80
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:39,112
and neither one of us-- we're
not gonna do anything about it.

81
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:54,894
WES:
That's got to be them.

82
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:56,362
Let's go.

83
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:17,317
L.A.P.D!

84
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:18,451
On the ground!

85
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,619
(groans)

86
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:22,822
What the hell?

87
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,891
You're under arrest!
Stay down!

88
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,429
Hey! What the hell are

89
00:04:29,497 --> 00:04:32,265
you guys doing here?
Hey! Check it out.

90
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,434
R.H.D. in the house.
Sorry, boys,

91
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,102
this is an S.I.S. bust.

92
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,971
We've been tracking
these two all week.

93
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:39,572
Give us a heads-up
next time, okay?

94
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,641
MAN: We work undercover.
You know that.

95
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,076
Mitchell.

96
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:45,178
Marks. How you doing?

97
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,080
WES: We're good.
We're just, uh,

98
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:48,915
moving out.
How's therapy?

99
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:50,483
You okay?

100
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,484
Hugging it out?

101
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,052
Crying on each other's
shoulders?

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,821
We're fine.

103
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,623
We're just leaving.

104
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,925
I only ask 'cause Pack-Man's
birthday's coming up.

105
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:00,693
Do not let him
get under your skin.

106
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:02,195
He ain't worth it.

107
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:05,064
Me and the fellas-- we're gonna
have a few beers in his honor.

108
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:06,466
You should stop by.

109
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:08,368
Do not...
Travis, no!

110
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:09,502
Travis, no, he's not...

111
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:12,371
MAN: Come and get it.
Come here.

112
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:14,607
Come here!

113
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:16,643
Relax and cut it out!

114
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,145
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you're doing fine.

115
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:22,916
Doing great.

116
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,267
RYAN: Guys, thanks so much
for your help

117
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:42,702
with the chairs.

118
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,804
These yoga people
have been insisting.

119
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:45,972
Night, Dr. Ryan.
Good night.

120
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,774
I'll see you all in a few days.

121
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:49,175
RYAN:
Okay. Take care.

122
00:05:50,878 --> 00:05:52,178
WES:
We need your help.

123
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:54,914
We're not as better off
without you

124
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:56,516
as we thought we'd be,

125
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:58,384
but other than that,
we're-we're good.

126
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:00,987

Look, uh,

127
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:02,488
you're the only doctor

128
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:04,390
that's been able to do
a damn thing for us,

129
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,493
and, uh... and we need you.

130
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:13,132
We need...

131
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,701
this.

132
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:16,603
We're sorry
that we broke your trust.

133
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,104
It wasn't just that.

134
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:20,039
I mean, you've been
reluctant to be here

135
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:22,342
since day one,
dragging your heels.

136
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,811
We'll do... better.

137
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:28,014
And what reason have
you given me to believe that?

138
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:33,486
None.

139
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:35,154
We want to change that,

140
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:38,791
and, uh, we've got
an offer for you.

141
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,561
TRAVIS (clears throat):
If...

142
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:43,396
you'll take us back,

143
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,331
we'll answer the question
we've been dodging

144
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,599
the entire time
we've been here.

145
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,968
We'll tell you

146
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:53,006

why I pulled the gun on you,

178
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,072
we have to tell her
the whole story.

179
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,474
(sighs) We have to start
from the beginning.

180
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,445
We have to tell her
about Pack-Man.

181
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,783
Yeah.

182
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,518
Who's Pack-Man?

183
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,492
(exhales)

184
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,094
Why are you even
bothering to enter

185
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,929
the sharpshooting
competition?

186
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,199
Why, the man asks.

187
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,274
(laughs)

188
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,809
Ain't no shame
in second place, baby.

189
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,811
Well, remind yourself that
when you're standing next to me

190
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,812
on the podium.

191
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,014
MAN: Damn it!
Something is

192
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,082
clearly wrong
with this weapon.

193
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,016
What's up with that guy?

194
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,886
Hey, you still working
the theory

195
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,355
that someone's killing
those working girls

196
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,689
who are disappearing
off Skid Row?

197
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,258
When I can, man. Why?

198
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,694
I was on a task force
with a guy from Missing Persons

199
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,329
who thinks the exact
same thing.

200
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,999
That's him right there.

201
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,000
MAN:
Hey, Mitchell!

202
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,168
Yeah?

203
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,636
Hey, Pack-Man, what's up?

204
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,038
PACK-MAN (chuckling):
You got to relax, bro.

205
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,806
You're gonna give
yourself an ulcer.

206
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,009
Hey, get over here.
I want you to meet someone.

207
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,748
(whispering):
What's with the suit?

208
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,586
This is Travis Marks.
He works Narco and Vice.

209
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,334
This is Wes Mitchell,
from Missing Persons.

210
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,255
Yeah.

211
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,458
You, uh, you spoke when
I was a cadet at the Academy.

212
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,994
Well, meet for real.

213
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,230
What's the line from that movie?

214
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,699
"This is gonna be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

215
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,971
RYAN: <i>So David Paek</i>
<i>introduced you two?</i>

216
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,055
No one called him David.
His name was Pack-Man.

217
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,690
Just Pack-Man.
But, yeah.

218
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,244
Travis and I teamed up
to catch the guy

219
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,046
who was killing
all those prostitutes.

220
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,348
Oh, I remember that case, yeah.
TRAVIS: Kind of a big deal.

221
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,083
Wes and I, we got, uh,

222
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,651
we got promoted to R.H.D.

223
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,787
It was a good year.
Yeah.

224
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,855
A lot of good police work,
a lot of arrests.

225
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,157
You remember "Storm Front"?

226
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,258
"Storm Front"?
"Storm Front."

227
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,592
Oh, God.

228
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,861
It's getting cloudy in here.
Cloudy.

229
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,797
So what's "Storm Front"?

230
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,598
You idiot cops.

231
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,169
You really think two of you
will bring down Los Guerreros?

232
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,337
Oh, you think
it's just the two of us?

233
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,706
We're just the tip
of the spear.

234
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,308
We got cops all over
this building.

235
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,677
If you're smart, you guys
would drop your guns

236
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,845
and give up.

237
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,013
I don't see nobody else.

238
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,115
How about you drop your guns?

239
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,917
Now!

240
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,224
(whispering): Any idea when
backup's coming?

241
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,559
Not soon enough.

242
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,860
Got an idea?

243
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,328
Now step back!

244
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,297
I think I see
a storm front coming.

245
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,801
Cloudy, cloudy storm front.
Got it.

246
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:26,051
(coughing)

247
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,419
Stay down.

248
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,454
Stay down.

249
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,491
(grunting and coughing)

250
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,192
WES:
I never would have guessed it.

251
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,228
Looks like Cuahtemoc's
a mellow high.

252
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,163
Yep. If you're going to jail,

253
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,764
that's the best way to do it,
right, guys?

254
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,600
(coughing and laughing)

255
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,035
Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh.
TRAVIS: Stop laughing.

256
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,304
I'm gonna breathe this stuff in.
(both laughing)

257
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,173
Well, it sounds like you enjoy
each other's company.

258
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,209
Well, for a while.

259
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,477
What happened?

260
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,812
We just kind of
went at each other.

261
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,414
And R.H.D. was different
back then.

262
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,984
You know, Captain Sutton
hadn't done therapy yet.

263
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,320
Damn thing never works!

264
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,389
Geez!

265
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,458
WES: Travis, I can't read
this report

266
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,627
because you printed it
on three-hole paper.

267
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,095
Of course you can read it.

268
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,429
It's only like
five words cut off.

269
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,132
The burden is not mine to posit
what words might be.

270
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,634
TRAVIS: It's right there...
Yo, boys.

271
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,003
You think you can put off
the catfight for a few minutes?

272
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,138
If you can, I'm buying.

273
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,842
PACK-MAN: Tacos, Wes, free tacos.
I can't believe it.

274
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,445
What is this?!

275
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,480
So, it sounds like
your friend was the only thing

276
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,015
that helped you get along.

277
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,716
At the time, yeah.

278
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,151
He pretty much was the only
thing we could agree on.

279
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,521
So, we decided
to help him out.

280
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,456
How so?

281
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,292
Well, Pack-Man introduced us,
and six weeks later,

282
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,127
we were working
Robbery-Homicide together.

283
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,462
And that's one of the best
assignments you can get.

284
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,932
Now, Pack-man, he was stuck back
in property crimes.

285
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,935
So we decided to throw
some busts his way.

286
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,603
Help boost his profile.

287
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,250
That's some solid shooting, kid.

288
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,621
You David Paek?

289
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,889
Pack-Man, yeah.

290
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,324
John Crowell.

291
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,426
S.I.S.
Nice to meet you.

292
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,461
I, uh, I wrote you a letter
when I was at the Academy.

293
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,396
Your name--
it keeps showing up

294
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,864
in these arrest reports.

295
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,633
It's impressive.

296
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,802
I just lost a guy
to desk duty.

297
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,503
I'm looking for someone.
If you're interested,

298
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,339
come and talk to me.

299
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,508
Gentlemen.

300
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,514
Oh, my God. Did he just...

301
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,717
Offer you a job
in S.I.S.? Yeah.

302
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,419
Welcome to the NFL, baby.
(laughing)

303
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,454
There ya go.

304
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,860
Uh, so, what is the S.I.S?

305
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,028
Special Investigations Section.

306
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,696
It's the other best assignment
you can get.

307
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,865
It's a covert tactical
surveillance team.

308
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,533
They do whatever they want,
whenever they want.

309
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,168
They don't have to answer
to anybody.

310
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,470
Wow, sounds like a great job.

311
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,771
Your friend must
have been delighted.

312
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,773
Well, we really didn't
see him much.

313
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,276
He was running undercover.
It was such a good gig,

314
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,677
we just assumed
he was fine until...

315
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,013
six months ago.

316
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,081
(rings)

317
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,117
R.H.D. Marks.
PACK-MAN: You gotta help me, man.

318
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,485
These guys are bad news, Trav.

319
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,986
It's gettin' weird.

320
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,554
What are you talking
about, Crowell?

321
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,023
No, all of them.

322
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,291
I think they're lining
their pockets,

323
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,026
skimming from the busts

324
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,494
they make, maybe even
pulling jobs of their own.

325
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,797
Hey, Pack-Man, it's Wes.
You sure about this?

326
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,065
I'm pretty sure.

327
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,267
I heard them talking
about something big.

328
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,735
A score that's going
to set them up for life.

329
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,570
I don't know.
What's the score?

330
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,907
I heard them say two things:

331
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,142
"We bought off Henry."

332
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,077
And a date: August 22nd.

333
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,378
It's right before my birthday.

334
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,414
I think they know that I know.

335
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,516
Crowell's been looking at me
weird, I swear.

336
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,551
Okay, just calm down.
Where are you right now?

337
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,354
Staking out a check-cashing
place in the Valley.

338
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,722
(cell phone beeps)

339
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,957
Guys, I got to go.
That's Crowell.

340
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,493
Okay, sit tight.
We'll be right there.

341
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,196
(siren blaring)

342
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,468
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

343
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,403
Where's Pack-Man?

344
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,338
Whoa, slow down.
We've been tracking

345
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,580
a whole bunch of robberies.

346
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,258
Pack-Man was running
surveillance, all right?

347
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:09,941
Where is he?

348
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:10,975
By the time
we got here,

349
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,844
he had taken
two of these guys out.

350
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,413
Your boy--
he wasn't wearing a vest.

Travis...
(cocks gun)

354
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:32,346
Do not move another inch

355
00:16:32,414 --> 00:16:34,415
or I swear to God I'll shoot.

356
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,921
TRAVIS:
<i>Okay, who's exaggerating now?</i>

357
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:42,556
I'm trying to make
a point here, okay?

358
00:16:42,624 --> 00:16:44,925
Guys, I think you're getting
ahead of yourselves.

359
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:46,794
What happened
after your friend was killed?

360
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:48,596
(sighs)

361
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:50,831
I, um, I just couldn't
let it go.

362
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:52,633
I mean, nothing about it
made sense.

363
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,069
Yeah, your friend said
he'd overheard them

364
00:16:55,137 --> 00:16:58,072
saying they'd turn
some guy named Henry?

365
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,740
Did you ever find out
who he was?

366
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:01,208
There's no way
to know for sure.

367
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:03,277
We started looking into S.I.S.

368
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,846
And the more we looked,
the less we liked these guys.

369
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:07,448
We went to Sutton,

370
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:10,051
and by that time, you got
your hooks into him.

00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,367
Are you awake?

00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:28,002
Of course I'm awake.

(sighing):
Wow, Cap.

376
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:38,212
You really getting into
this therapy thing, huh?

377
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,848
It was either that
or lose Helen.

378
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:44,185
Now why are you two
disturbing my peace?

379
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:46,754
WES:
Pack-Man was shot six times.

380
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:48,255
But the shot

381
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:50,624
that actually killed him

382
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,526
came from behind.

383
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:53,761
He was murdered
by the guys

384
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:55,296
who held up
that check-cashing place.

385
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:58,065
How'd that happen?

386
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,867
Well, the driver
could have shot him.

387
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,268
Not possible.
Getaway driver was seen

388
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:03,070
parked right out front
of that store.

389
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:04,872
And there's no way
he could have flanked Pack-Man.

390
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,006
What are you trying to say?

391
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:07,141
Listen, Captain,
we've been looking

392
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:09,043
into these S.I.S guys,
and it's not good.

WES:
Financials don't add up.

Each one of them lives
in a place no cop can afford.

Well, you live in a house

I don't have a bank account
in Curacao.

John Crowell does.

398
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:23,858
You make accusations against
four highly decorated cops,

399
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,594
you better be able to bounce
a quarter off the evidence.

400
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:28,496
Now, what you guys have got
is circumstantial.

401
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,097
You guys got
to be careful.

402
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:32,066
These guys are dangerous.

403
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:33,534
That's why we got
to stay on this.

404
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:35,202
I wasn't finished.
I said they're dangerous.

405
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,371
(phone rings) You get me something
that I can work with.

406
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,273
I'll go after them
with everything we got.

407
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:41,142
It's the hospital.

408
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,643
I told them to get
in touch with me

409
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:44,445
if the cashier ever came
out of his coma.

410

WES: Can you work
with a witness, Captain?

411
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:50,751
He hasn't opened his eyes yet,
but he is responding to stimuli.

412
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:52,586
He's been mumbling
about getting shot.

What are you doing?

417

Hey, hey,
get away from him.

418
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,164
I'm bringing him flowers.

419
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:05,332
Carrano's our witness.
Relax.

420
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,001
Well, I think we can
take it from here.

421
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:09,103
You guys paranoid
about something?

422
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:10,938
You clear on who
the bad guys are?

423
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:13,941
Yeah, we're clear.

424
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:16,010
Good.

00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:23,818
WOMAN:
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

426
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:25,452
They must have known
you were on to them.

427
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:29,824
Uh... yeah.

428
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:31,325
How long have you been sitting there?
Sorry...

429
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,327
It's just technically
we're supposed

430
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:35,329
to have the room right now
and it's just such a good story.

431
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:37,565
I really appreciate
your understanding,

432
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:40,734
but these are my patients;
they need their space.

433
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:42,570
Can you at least tell us
how it ends?

434
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,773
Sorry.

435
00:19:52,514 --> 00:19:54,548
You just said
we're your patients.

436
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:57,051
You are my patients
at this exact moment.

437
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:58,919
We will see where we are
when this is done.

438
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:02,523
Okay.

439
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:04,859
Well, Carrano
eventually did wake up.

440
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:06,794
He said he saw someone
sneak up behind Pack-Man

441
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,929
and shoot him in the back.

442
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:10,664
Couldn't give
an exact description,

443
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,700
but it was damn close
to John Crowell.

444
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,902
And that was enough
to start a formal inquiry.

445
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,670
That's great.

446
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:19,640
That's not good?

447
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,844
Counselor, I've granted you
two separate continuances.

448
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:26,080
Now, can you produce
your witness or not?

449
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,515
Your Honor, we're trying
to locate Damian Carrano.

450
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,150
He hasn't been to work
in over a week.

451
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,986
His apartment is empty.

452
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,287
That's unfortunate
for your case.

453
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,089
If you can find
Mr. Carrano,

454
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:36,290
you can refile
your charges.

455
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:37,925
Dismissed.
(bangs gavel)

456
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:41,662
Easy, easy.

457
00:20:49,971 --> 00:20:51,605
TRAVIS: <i>We had people</i>
<i>protecting Carrano,</i>

458
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:53,007
<i>and these guys are so good</i>

459
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:54,508
that they must have
paid them off,

460
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:56,377
made them run,
or buried him somewhere.

461
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:59,313
We couldn't even
refile the case.

462
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,515
Wow.
That must have been painful.

463
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,784
Yeah.
Yeah.

464
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:05,686
TRAVIS: The thing is,
John Crowell not only

465
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:09,623
needed to win in court;
he needed to gloat about it.

466
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,261
You ready to tell this for real?

467
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,814
Tough one, kid.

468
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:36,183
I've eaten it
plenty of times in court, too.

469
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,418
You must be feeling

470
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:39,820
like ass right now.

471
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,956
Let me tell you something
that might give you

472
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:43,958
some clarity
on the situation.

473
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:48,929
(whispering)

474
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:52,833
Now, I want you
to think about that

475
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:55,369
when you're rewinding
that one in your brain.

476
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:08,482
What'd the meatheads want?

477
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,684
Hey.

478
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:11,685
Hey, Travis.

479
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:15,389
Travis.

480
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:17,524
Travis, talk to me.

481
00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:23,564
Travis? Hey, Travis.

482
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:24,965
Hey, hey, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

483
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:26,233
Hey, no. Talk to me.

484
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:28,435
Let's sit down and talk
about it, all right?

485
00:22:28,503 --> 00:22:30,104
What did he say?

486
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:34,141
Travis!

487
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,275
(cocks gun)

488
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:39,446
You move one more inch,

489
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:41,281
I swear to God I'll shoot.

490
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,388
Mitchell!

491
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:49,256
Put it down, kid.

492
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:52,426
You got 30 cops
in this room.

493
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:55,529
If you don't stand down,
somebody's got to draw.

494
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:00,501
Come on.

495
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,102
Lower the gun.

496
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,175
(handcuffs clicking)

497
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:22,623
What did he say to you?

498
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:28,762
He told me he killed Pack-Man.

499
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,783
I was suspended pending
an administrative hearing.

500
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,618
And when I told the trial board

501
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:49,320
why I pulled my gun
on my partner, that I did it

502
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,989
to keep him from
shooting John Crowell...

503
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:52,123
I wasn't gonna shoot him.

504
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:53,124
Damn it, Travis!

505
00:23:53,192 --> 00:23:54,392
Yes, you were.

506
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,227
I saw the look on your face!

507
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:57,896
You cocked your gun.
There was no consoling you.

508
00:23:57,963 --> 00:23:59,230
So what?

509
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:00,198
There was no restraining you!

510
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:06,938
When I told

511
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:10,175
the trial board
why I did what I did,

512
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,310
they ordered us both
to stay away from

513
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:14,112
John Crowell and his men.

514
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,448
And they let us
back on duty,

515
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:17,549
th two conditions.

516
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:19,517
One, we do this.

517
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,453
And two, neither one of us

518
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,222
could go anywhere
near S.I.S.

519
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,493
So it worked out perfectly
for John Crowell.

520
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:30,662
It seems that way.

521
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,430
It was a smart play.

522
00:24:32,498 --> 00:24:34,065
He provoked a hothead
into coming after him.

523
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,303
And now that we know

524
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,472
Crowell and his buddies
are planning something big,

525
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,440
we're not even allowed to sniff around.
That shouldn't stop us.

526
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:44,309
That's not all
that's stopping us, Travis!

527
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:46,678
I'm not gonna let you throw your
life away and shoot this guy.

528
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,146
I just said I wasn't
gonna shoot him!

529
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:49,547
How do you know it?!
You're not even willing

530
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:50,615
to admit you were gonna
shoot him

531
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:52,350
six months ago!
I know!

532
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:54,252
You haven't even thanked me

533
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,322
for saving you from making the
biggest mistake of your life!

534
00:24:57,389 --> 00:24:59,557
At great cost

535
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,327
to my own career, I might add.

536
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:06,397
Why should I believe you now?

537
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,267
Because they killed Pack-Man.

538
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,002
Do you understand that?
They killed Pack-Man!

539
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,837
I know that.

540
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:14,405
You don't have the market
cornered on grief, Travis.

541
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,974
When did I say that?!

542
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,008
Huh?
Guys.

543
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:18,510
When did I say that?

544
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:19,511
Guys, guys, guys.

545
00:25:19,578 --> 00:25:20,612
You are so close

546
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:22,147
to making real progress here.

547
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:24,349
Don't start sniping
at each other.

548
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,050
Travis, have you
told Wes the truth

549
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:27,786
about what happened that night?

550
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:40,498
No.

551
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:49,107
I don't really know what was
gonna happen that night.

552
00:25:53,913 --> 00:25:55,780
And I did have my gun.

553
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:04,522
Thank you.

554
00:26:07,493 --> 00:26:09,527
I wasn't in a good place.

555
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:19,103
But that was six months ago.

556
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:20,939
I'm different now.

557
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:24,342
We're different now.

558
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,013
I promise you,
I'm not gonna shoot him.

559
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:31,883
Wes, do you believe
that Travis has changed?

560
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:35,186
Can you take his word for it?

561
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:44,062
Yeah.

562
00:26:46,265 --> 00:26:48,233
Then, guys, I think

563
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,901
you're in agreement.

564
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:51,769
I've only got one
thing left to say,

565
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:54,038
and it really isn't
very therapeutic.

566
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:59,410
Go kick their ass.

567
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:07,852
♪

568
00:27:15,794 --> 00:27:17,695
TRAVIS:
<i>You wanted me to see</i>

569
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,831
<i>the Southern California</i>
<i>Expo Center?</i>

570
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,165
WES:
Mm-hmm.

571
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:22,267
Why?

572
00:27:31,143 --> 00:27:33,845
They come here.

573
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:37,115
Crowell, Reese,
Serra, Prince

574
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:40,051
come here at night,
take pictures

575
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:43,087
and walk around
the perimeter.

576
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:45,189
I'd say they're
casing the place.

577
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,594
You've been following them.

578
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:52,030
When I can.

579
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:53,865
You're not supposed
to do that.

580
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:57,535
They killed Pack-Man.

581
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:05,677
Why this place?

582
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:07,211
Well...

583
00:28:31,303 --> 00:28:34,305
WES:
Captain? Captain?

584
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:36,374
Did you sleep here
all night?

585
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:38,409
(sighs):
Oh, geez.

586
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:40,445
I set the alarm
so I could get up

587
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,347
before anybody got here.

588
00:28:42,414 --> 00:28:44,983
What are you guys doing here?

589
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,918
Well...

590
00:28:53,592 --> 00:28:55,860
I already tried diamonds
with Helen.

591
00:28:55,928 --> 00:28:57,395
It didn't work.

592
00:28:57,463 --> 00:29:00,999
No, Cap, uh,
it's not about Helen.

593
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,900
There's millions of dollars
worth of stones

594
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:05,703
moving through
that trade show.

595
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:07,105
S.I.S. is planning
to rip it off.

596
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:09,607
And you know this how?

597
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:11,309
TRAVIS: Pack-Man says that
they pulled jobs on

598
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:13,344
their own sometimes, Cap.
They been casing the place.

599
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:15,646
SUTTON:
You go after these guys,

600
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,548
you're gonna roll the dice
with your careers.

601
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:19,117
Not to mention mine.

602
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:20,818
That's why we're here.

603
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:22,353
We don't move unless
you want us to move.

604
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:24,155
No, what I want you to do
is be right.

605
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,590
I suggest you get
the hell out of here,

606
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:28,793
let me get dressed, huh?

607
00:29:42,474 --> 00:29:44,776
TRAVIS: <i>We don't know how they're</i>

608
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:46,911
<i>so we have to be ready</i>
<i>for anything.</i>

609
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:49,414
We need people on every
exit, every entrance.

610
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:52,250
These guys know what they're
doing; they will shoot back.

611
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:53,985
TRAVIS: <i>There's no guarantee</i>
<i>that this ends well.</i>

612
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:01,426
You join this op, you put
your career on the line.

613
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,861
Does anybody want out?

614
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:05,730
Good.

615
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:06,831
Let's go.

616
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:32,657
TRAVIS:
Slip in through the side door,

617
00:30:32,724 --> 00:30:35,460
gear up where nobody can
see you, and then pull the job.

618
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:38,362
(alarm ringing)

619
00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:41,699
They work fast.

620
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,935
All units, be advised,
we are going in.

621
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:46,404
(people screaming, clamoring)

622
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:50,074
Hey!
LAPD! Put it down!

623
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:20,071
Police!

624
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:57,175
Don't move.
Don't move.

625
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:59,644
Hands up.
Hands up. Hands up.

626
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,047
Up, up, up.

627
00:32:03,115 --> 00:32:04,482
Hey!

628
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,321
You're not S.I.S.

629
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,223
What the hell?

630
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,333
Police!

631
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:25,102
Stay there!

632
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,537
Damn it!

633
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:28,472
Hey! Get him up, now!
CROWELL: Hey!

634
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,542
Why the hell are you
shooting at my men,

635
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,378
and why are you in the middle
of our bust again?

636
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:36,514
What are you talking about, "your bust?"
Yeah!

637
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,249
We've been tracking
the Huns for a year.

638
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,884
And all those people
you put in danger...

639
00:32:39,952 --> 00:32:41,485
Then you take a shot
at my guy.

640
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:43,921
Your guy should have identified
himself, all right?

641
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:46,157
Before the operation!
You have no right.

642
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:48,092
This is harassment!

643
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,562
You're not gonna
survive this.

644
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:55,233
You're done.

645
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:07,698
CROWELL:   Backing your men is one thing,
Captain, but when your men

646
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:10,334
are pursuing a vendetta,

647
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:12,710
somebody's gotta step in
and be a grownup!

648
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:14,617
TRAVIS: Looks like
he's holding his own in there.

649
00:33:15,215 --> 00:33:16,991
No, come on. He's getting
torn apart in there.

650
00:33:16,992 --> 00:33:18,807
These guys put a year of police work... 
WES: I don't get it.

651
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:20,843
Pack-Man said they were planning

652
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,578
something big right
before his birthday.

653
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:24,981
Anthey were staking out
that Expo Center.

654
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:26,749
They were staking it out because
they were planning a big bust.

655
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:28,418
You believe Pack-Man was just...

656
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:29,419
Wrong?

657
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:32,555
I don't know.

658
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:44,367
How'd it go?

659
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:46,536
You're each going to get
a two-month rap,

660
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:49,205
and after your suspension,
you have a choice.

661
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:52,375
You stay together,
you go to Pawn Shop Division.

662
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:54,310
Or you split up
and you go back

663
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:56,546
to the respective departments
that you came from.

664
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,581
TRAVIS: So... pick between
a crap detail

665
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:01,217
or split up?
You're lucky you have a choice at all.

666
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:03,019
Figure out what you
want to do, but...

667
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:05,121
you got to turn your shields in
in the morning, huh?

668
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:08,891
What's gonna happen to you?

669
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:12,361
My career's in the rear-view
mirror as it is anyway.

670
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:16,065
I'll be all right.

671
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:27,243
Oh, you're here.

672
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:29,645
Good.

673
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:31,447
Everything okay?

674
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:32,682
It, uh...

675
00:34:32,749 --> 00:34:33,950
(clears throat)

676
00:34:34,017 --> 00:34:35,118
it didn't go our way.

677
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:38,821
I'm sorry.

678
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,824
Uh... I've got a few minutes
before the session starts,

679
00:34:41,892 --> 00:34:43,626
but we could talk about it...

680
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:46,095
We're not here for therapy.
We just wanted to say good-bye.

681
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,664
TRAVIS: If Wes and I want to stay
detectives, we have to split up,

682
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:51,000
so no more couple...

683
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:52,535
you know, no more
couples therapy.

684
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:55,037
I see.

685
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:56,739
You've been a good doctor.

686
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:58,174
So thank you.

687
00:34:58,242 --> 00:35:00,076
I was a good doctor,

688
00:35:00,144 --> 00:35:01,677
and I will continue to be one
until you walk out of that door.

689
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:02,912
Talk to me.

690
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,647
What happened?

691
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:06,415
Look, it doesn't matter.

692
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,684
We were wrong about this one.

693
00:35:08,752 --> 00:35:10,786
Ha.

694
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:13,322
In the last two months,
I have seen the two of you

695
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,358
bet on the outcome
of therapy exercises.

696
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:17,059
I have seen you start

697
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:19,495
and finish
a spitball competition...

698
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:20,963
Yeah, listen,
we suck at therapy...

699
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:23,099
I'm not done.

700
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,134
But I have never, in that time,

701
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:26,802
known you to be wrong
about your work.

702
00:35:28,138 --> 00:35:30,273
Not when it was this important.

703
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,475
So think about that
before you quit.

704
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:55,731
You need some help
cleaning all this up?

705
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:57,200
Nah, I'm good.

706
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,483
So, um...

707
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:24,927
I'll see you.

708
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:26,862
What if she was right?

709
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,665
Dr. Ryan. What if...
what if we aren't wrong?

710
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:31,334
You think I haven't
wondered that, Travis?

711
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:33,169
Maybe Crowell and his men were
gonna steal some of those jewels

712
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,704
after they arrested the Huns,

713
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:36,839
but we're not going to
know that for sure now.

714
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,808
Their plan changed
once they saw us there.

715
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,843
Wes, four guys cannot
set themselves up

716
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:44,780
for life off of
<i>some</i> of the jewels.

717
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:54,257
Okay.

718
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,262
I'll play.

719
00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:04,133
Crowell and his men couldn't
have arrested the Huns

720
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:05,735
and then just had all
that evidence disappear

721
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:07,436
from the crime scene.

722
00:37:07,504 --> 00:37:08,704
There's... there's
too many questions.

723
00:37:08,772 --> 00:37:10,539
Those jewels have
not disappeared

724
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,508
off the face of the earth.
They might as well have.

725
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,710
To get at them now,
S.I.S. would have to get

726
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:16,245
into that evidence locker.

727
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:19,448
It could be done.

728
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:21,651
Once you pay off the right guy.

729
00:37:24,254 --> 00:37:25,988
Henry.

730
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:27,723
We always assumed

731
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:29,859
Henry was working somewhere they
were planning to hit, right?

732
00:37:29,926 --> 00:37:31,727
What if he works here?

733
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:33,529
Yeah, they make a big bust,

734
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:34,797
look like heroes.

735
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:36,299
Then, a little while later,

736
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:37,667
millions of dollars' worth
of evidence just....

737
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:39,435
disappears.

738
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:41,404
Or maybe someone breaks in,
holds the place up.

739
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:43,973
Another member of the Huns?

740
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:46,709
Make sure you check "Henry"
as a first and a last name.

741
00:37:46,777 --> 00:37:47,977
Of course I'm going
to check it

742
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:50,012
as a first and last name,
Travis.

743
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,781
Please, it's our last day
together; don't be patronizing.

744
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:52,948
Ooh.
Ooh?

745
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:55,818
Look at this.

746
00:37:55,886 --> 00:37:59,588
There are eight cops with the
last name Henry in the LAPD.

747
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:02,091
