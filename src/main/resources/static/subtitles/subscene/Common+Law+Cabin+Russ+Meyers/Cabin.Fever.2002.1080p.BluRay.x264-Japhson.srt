1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:00,167
23.976

2
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:14,583
Hey, boy.

3
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:22,292
Hey, boy!

4
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,542
Come on, boy.

5
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:29,875
Hey!

6
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,000
Hey!

7
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,875
Hey, fella.

8
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,292
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

9
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,042
No more fucking finals!

10
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:50,042
Hey, don't do it!
Don't go to college.

11
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,083
It's a fucking scam.
It fucking sucks!

12
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,417
- Bert, got any more smokes?
- No.

13
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,042
Bert: So I'm fat. So what?
I hope she's not anorexic.

14
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Put her there, sport!

15
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:41,500
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

16
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,708
- Jesus!
- God damn it, Dennis, no!

17
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,167
No, Dennis, no!

18
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,500
No, don't hit him
or anything.

19
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:53,125
Everybody knows not
to sit next to Dennis.

20
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:57,292
- He'll give you tetanus.
- Maybe you should make a sign.

21
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,792
There's a stream around back,
if you want to wash your hand.

22
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,833
I'll get you a towel.

23
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,708
Hey, pal,

24
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,417
do you think it's a smart idea
leaving your kid here

25
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,208
where he might be
a danger to people?

26
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,958
What are you saying exactly?

27
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,125
I'm just saying,
if such an incident

28
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,625
were to bring about a "lawsuit,"

29
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:30,375
- you might be held liable.
- Jeff, save it for law school.

30
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:42,458
Cute kid.

31
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,667
Hey.

32
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,417
What's your name?

33
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,750
Yeah!

34
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Man: If you're interested
in really good glasswork,

35
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,417
it's cheap,
but it's an antique.

36
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,167
Some of those bottles
up there

37
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,667
are dated
before the Civil War.

38
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,708
And over there,
I used to have-

39
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,750
in that empty space,
I used to have

40
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:25,667
some of the prettiest
Shirley Temple bottles I've ever seen.

41
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:29,542
And this woman came in here
with the palsy, the poor soul.

42
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,708
She thought
they were so cute,

43
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,875
and she reached for them
and knocked every one down

44
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,500
and broke them all
to damn pieces.

45
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:38,042
So I took her in the back and gave her
some coke and ammonia.

46
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,750
I thought she was
gonna have a spell.

47
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,917
We should get something
for your mom to say thanks.

48
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,542
How about some fox piss?

49
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,583
- My mom would love fox piss.
- Oh Lord, don't drop that.

50
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,000
If you do,
that's powerful stuff.

51
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:51,708
All the foxes around
would come down here.

52
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,292
You'd have friends
you'd never had before.

53
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,458
You all here for a vacation?

54
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,167
Jeff: Yeah, we're renting
a cabin for a week.

55
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,625
That's nice. And if you go
in the woods...

56
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:05,333
- be very careful.
- Why, what's in the woods?

57
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,583
Tommy, get those kids
their sandwiches.

58
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,500
They're all wrapped up.

59
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:13,458
- So, what's the fox urine for?
- That's for foxes.

60
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:17,583
- What's the rifle for?
- That's for niggers.

61
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,417
Okay, let's see.
Let's give you those sandwiches now.

62
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,917
I think we're about ready
to get y'all out of here.

63
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,417
- That's $56 even.
- Okay.

64
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,458
Anything I can do
for you, friend?

65
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,375
No, I think that's...

66
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:34,083
Thank you.

67
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,250
You all have
a good vacation now.

68
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:39,125
- You too.
- Come back and see me.

69
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,792
Thanks a lot, man.
You have a nice day.

70
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,250
Jeff: Did that guy
just say, "nigger"?

71
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,208
Marcy: Yeah, you
don't have to repeat it.

72
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,500
You can call it the "n" word.

73
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,958
Hey.

74
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,167
Boy, you want to give me
one good reason

75
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,375
why you would steal
a Snickers bar.

76
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,500
The nougat?

77
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,458
Sorry, man.
My bad.

78
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,167
All right. Enjoy.

79
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:16,542
Thanks.

80
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,958
What?

81
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,583
Moron.

82
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,417
Jeff:
What's wrong with you, dude?

83
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,208
Bert: Sorry.

84
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,333
I should burn his fucking
store down, the racist fuck!

85
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,583
- Marcy: All right, make a left.
- Jeff: Here?

86
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,833
- Marcy: Make a left.
- Jeff: Where else am I gonna go?

87
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,500
- Jeff: Oh, and then down here...
- Bert: Stop the car!

88
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,250
Stop, stop!

89
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:49,333
I left my Mott's apple juice
back at the store!

90
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,417
- Women: Oh my God.
- Come on!

91
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,333
- Paul: No, we're not going back.
- Come on!

92
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,875
Paul: I'm sure this river
is in the map, right?

93
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:57,083
Yes!

94
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,167
Paul: There's no way
that this is on the map.

95
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,042
Karen: It is on the map.
Do you want to look?

96
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,792
This map's for Cincinnati.

97
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,625
Karen: Shut up.

98
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,542
Jeff: Fine, fuck it.
We'll go this way.

99
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,542
Marcy:
Oh my gosh. Wow.

100
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,708
"Welcome, y'all.

101
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,542
Enjoy your vacation
from all of us

102
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,542
at Bunyan Mountain Getaways."

103
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,875
Oh my God, Jeff,
check it out.

104
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:01,375
It's so cute- this little room,
this little bed...

105
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,125
lts view is so beautiful.

106
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,625
The view of the shrubs...

107
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,875
and the bush
and the antlers.

108
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:12,167
It's gonna be so perfect.
We're here for a week,

109
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,708
and there's no one
to bother us.

110
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,417
Who's up for a dip?

111
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,583
We're- they're-

112
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,917
Yeah. Safe sex.

113
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,917
- Eh, Paul?
- Yeah?

114
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:31,167
Have fun.

115
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,583
It's kind of sweet,
you know?

116
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,750
They seem pretty in love.

117
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:48,167
Bert, what the hell is that?

118
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,917
Huh? I'm gonna go shoot
some squirrels.

119
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,083
Why would you want
to kill squirrels?

120
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,000
- 'Cause they're gay.
- Don't be a fucking retard.

121
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,000
Kidding. I don't care if
they're gay or straight.

122
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,250
- I'll kill them either way.
- Will you be careful with that?

123
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,833
Would you relax, man?
It's a fucking BB gun. Relax.

124
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,083
Sorry.

125
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,792
So, Karen...

126
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,625
how long have we
known each other?

127
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,958
Seventh grade, right?

128
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:17,208
Yeah.

129
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:22,208
I was thinking, we've known
each other for so long,

130
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,083
and even though we-

131
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,417
Karen: That's hot!

132
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,708
And, even though we've
always been good friends,

133
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,833
we never actually-

134
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,917
I've always thought
you were really cool.

135
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,250
Hey, race you to the raft.

136
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:56,125
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la ¢Ü

137
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,083
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la la la... ¢Ü

138
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:03,333
Fuck!

139
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,417
Jeff: Oh my God!

140
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,708
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la la la... ¢Ü

141
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,500
Oh, feels fucking great!

142
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,958
- You like that?
- Yeah!

143
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,458
Jeff: I'm sorry.
Oh yeah!

144
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,958
So you know Ken Webb?

145
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:44,958
Yeah.

146
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,958
Short, greasy Ken.

147
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,667
The guy with the CDs, right?

148
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

149
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,917
He tried to kiss me.

150
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,792
- He did?
- Yeah.

151
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,667
Two days ago.

152
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,750
This guy I've known
for 12 years,

153
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,667
he's a family friend.

154
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,917
He puts his hands
on my face,

155
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:10,125
full-on tongue!
It was so gross!

156
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,625
Why, was it gross because
you've known him for so long or...

157
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,958
'cause he's gross?

158
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,625
No, it was definitely him.

159
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,667
I don't know. When you've known
someone a long time,

160
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,792
you just want to kiss them just
to see if they're a good kisser.

161
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,958
There's nothing wrong
with that, right?

162
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:49,958
No.

163
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,083
- Where are you going?
- What's it look like?

164
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:10,292
- I thought we were kissing.
- Yeah, we were.

165
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,875
So-

166
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,708
so what, you like me now?
Is this like a date?

167
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,458
Don't be gay.

168
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,292
Come back, Mr. Woodchuck.

169
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:56,333
I'm gonna get you now.

170
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,458
Oh shit.

171
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,583
Oh fuck.

172
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,333
I'm sorry, man.

173
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,208
What?

174
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:25,333
- Why did you shoot me?
- I thought you were something else.

175
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,167
I didn't- fuck!

176
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,625
- Are you all right?
- I'm s-

177
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:31,833
sick.

178
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,458
- I need help.
- Oh man.

179
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,500
I'll get you
some help, all right?

180
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,583
I'll be right back.
I got a car.

181
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,333
Oh fuck.

182
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,500
Oh please, help me.

183
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,208
- Fuck.
- I'm sick. I need water.

184
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,958
Just lay down.
Don't move, man.

185
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,958
- Water.
- I'll get you water.

186
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,542
Just stay-
don't come near me, okay?

187
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,333
Is that your-

188
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,375
- is that your cabin?
- No!

189
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:59,042
Just stay there!
Please, stay there.

190
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,167
Don't make me
fucking shoot you, man.

191
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,917
Just stay the fuck back,
please!

192
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,417
Fuck!

193
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,500
Fuck!

194
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,000
Fuck!

195
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,667
What the fuck, man?
Where were you?

196
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,458
You gonna burn the whole
fucking place down?

197
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,208
What are you,
Smoky the Clown now?

198
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,042
Don't you mean,
Smoky the Bear?

199
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,042
Whatever.
This is horseshit, man.

200
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,458
- It's a fireplace.
- How old are you?

201
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,625
Can't you be responsible
for anything?

202
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,292
We can't leave you alone
for five minutes

203
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,500
without you destroying something!
What were you shooting at?

204
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,542
I heard a squirrel.
I was just looking for a squirrel.

205
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,167
- A squirrel?
- Yeah.

206
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,292
- Fucking idiot.
- Jeff: To stick up his ass.

207
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,750
Jeff: Why don't you
tell us the story?

208
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,500
What are you gonna roast
on that thing?

209
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,000
Come on, Paul,
tell them story.

210
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,375
No, I can't.
It's a traumatic experience.

211
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,292
- I don't want to talk about it.
- We like traumatic stories.

212
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,333
- Not about me, but...
- Trauma bonds people.

213
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,083
- You can tell us.
- It bonds those who go through it,

214
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,042
- not the people you tell it to.
- Tell the fucking story!

215
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,917
All right!

216
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,917
So there's this bowling alley
when we were growing up.

217
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,042
You guys might remember it-
Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl?

218
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,750
It was in Brighton, right?

219
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,458
That's probably why it was
called Brighton Bowl.

220
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,750
We used to go there
for birthday parties

221
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,292
or with my dad
for the weekend.

222
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:38,042
This one time, I asked
my dad if we could go.

223
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,708
He's like, "No.
The bowling alley's closed."

224
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,208
This marshmallow's so burnt!

225
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,917
It turned out there had
been a break-in.

226
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,583
All the employees
were held at gunpoint.

227
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:55,000
After they had been
gagged and beaten,

228
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:58,042
they were tied to chairs.

229
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,500
The chairs...
they were set in a circle,

230
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:07,583
so that way everybody
was forced to watch

231
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,625
everybody else.

232
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,708
And then the robber,

233
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,208
this sick maniac,

234
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,042
he goes and finds one of those
little ball-peen hammers.

235
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,083
And then one by one...

236
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:24,708
he smashed the backs
of their heads open with the hammer.

237
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:27,292
Everyone had to watch
their friends die,

238
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,167
knowing that they'd
soon be next.

239
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,583
Ball-peen...

240
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,292
The guy doesn't stop there.

241
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,708
He breaks out the fire axe.

242
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,708
The alarm goes off...
he doesn't give a shit.

243
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,917
He hacked off
all of their limbs.

244
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,958
The cops found six
bloody torsos

245
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,208
tied to the bowling seats.

246
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,625
Blood everywhere...

247
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,917
Turns out the guy was
some disgruntled employee.

248
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,708
That was
my childhood playground.

249
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,542
Bert, you asshole,
it's not funny.

250
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,500
Yes it is,
you fucking slut.

251
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:09,667
Jeff?

252
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,083
What?

253
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,417
Tell them about
the happy bald guy.

254
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:17,000
- No, I can't take it.
- He gave us our shoes

255
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:19,250
and quarters for
the video games.

256
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,250
There was a room with
a pool table,

257
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,292
but my dad wouldn't
let us go there.

258
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,750
The bald guy was always happy,
always smiling.

259
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,917
But the killer
got him too.

260
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,917
When the cops searched
the place,

261
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,125
they found hacked off limbs
at the end of the bowling lanes.

262
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,250
The guy had bowled
people's organs.

263
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:39,792
Arms, legs, everything.

264
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,917
They found the bald guy's head
in the ball return.

265
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,292
- He was still smiling.
- Oh, no.

266
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,917
I knew you were full of shit!
You suck!

267
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,583
No! It was in the paper.
I swear!

268
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,083
I'm laughing because

269
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,542
Jeff is an asshole
and he's making me laugh.

270
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,792
I swear...

271
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,917
I loved this place.
I still remember the sounds...

272
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,083
the cracking,
the bouncing.

273
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,917
The smell of the shoes,
the sound of the Q-Bert machine...

274
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,208
Holy shit!
What are you doing?!

275
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,625
- I'm cool.
- Are you spying on us?

276
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,958
- I'm cool.
- Is your dog friendly?

277
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,042
Yeah, he's cool.

278
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,042
This is Dr. Mambo.
Here, boy.

279
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,750
Come on, Dr. Mambo.

280
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,917
Is it "Dr." like a physician
or a professor?

281
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,375
Yeah, he's a professor...

282
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:34,125
of being a dog.
Oof! Faced!

283
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,167
Scratch-moded.

284
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:50,542
It's a positive bonfire.

285
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,000
Got room for one more?

286
00:21:55,917 --> 00:22:00,042
Actually, we were having a private
conversation, if you don't mind.

287
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,958
That's cool.

288
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,500
I guess I'll smoke
all this weed by myself.

289
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,917
All: No, no.
It's fine.

290
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,083
It's not that private.

291
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,167
Awesome.

292
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,958
Yeah, sit right here.

293
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,042
Bert: I think he's gonna
fuck her.

294
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,000
Guy: Awesome.

295
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,500
- Wait, so your name was...
- Justin...

296
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,042
- but you can call me "Grim."
- Grim.

297
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,375
Like Grimace?

298
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:29,708
"Grim" is my skating name.

299
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,833
I got it in Berkeley while
competing in the X-Games.

300
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,875
Really? Karen's going
to go to Berkeley.

301
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,375
Dude...

302
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:39,333
awesome.

303
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,208
I love Berkeley.
People there are so wacked.

304
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:47,167
I met these guys and they had me
fucked up for five days straight.

305
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,625
They wouldn't let me drink
anything but beer.

306
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:53,292
Yeah, I've done that,
except I did it with JD.

307
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,458
Karen's got a great idea.

308
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,292
We should only drink beer
for the rest of the trip.

309
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,125
I could probably do that,
but I doubt you could.

310
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:03,792
I'll bet you. I can only drink
beer the rest of the trip.

311
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:07,000
If I drink anything else,
you can have the rest of my supply.

312
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:09,417
All right, you're on.
We only drink beer.

313
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,875
Bert: You're on.

314
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:14,542
So, you're a skater?
Is that your occupation?

315
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:17,667
Oh, crap.

316
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,958
Party's over.

317
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,792
Hey Justin...
Grim...

318
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,792
you want to come inside?

319
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,875
I'd love to, but I left
all this shit outside my tent.

320
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,792
It's starting to rain,
if it gets fucked up,

321
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,792
it's like $4,000 worth
of shit pissed away.

322
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,292
How far away is your tent?

323
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,958
20 minutes away, but if I book
I can be back in 30.

324
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,292
- Cool. Bring the weed.
- I will.

325
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,833
Check you dudes later.
Come on, Dr. Mambo.

326
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,125
- Jeff: Freak.
- Karen: I thought he was funny.

327
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,208
Bert:
How did it work?

328
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,083
What do you mean "how"?
It had a hose...

329
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,292
a bunch of different settings,

330
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,792
pulse, power...

331
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,333
stream.

332
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,625
And you came every time?

333
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:09,042
Totally.

334
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,833
You can imagine my disappointment
the first time I had sex.

335
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,000
Tell me about it.

336
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:17,458
What's that supposed
to mean?

337
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
- I've got a better story.
- Paul: I'm sorry,

338
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,625
but no story is better
than Karen and the shower massage.

339
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,125
No, seriously.

340
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:28,333
One time I was masturbating...

341
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,250
and my dog came up
and started licking my balls.

342
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:34,208
Right as I came it stuck
its tongue up my ass.

343
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,042
That's serious fucking
masturbation talent right there.

344
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,042
Fucking good.

345
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:45,417
He'd better have brought more weed
or I won't let him in.

346
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,625
Relax, pal.
I'm coming.

347
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,458
His name's Grim.

348
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,667
Jesus Christ.

349
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:01,250
Help me...
please.

350
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,750
I need a doctor.

351
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:05,458
Oh shit.

352
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,958
Man: Doctor.

353
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,917
Yeah, all right.

354
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,500
Somebody grab a blanket
or something.

355
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,333
You...

356
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,792
you shot me.

357
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:26,833
No, no, no.

358
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:29,417
There's no way this contagious
fucker's coming in here.

359
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,500
- He's sick, for Christ's sake.
- You want him to come in here

360
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:36,500
and touch all of your shit,
your fucking soap...?

361
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:38,500
Let's throw him
a blanket or something.

362
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,625
- Or your douche?
- Let's drive him to a doctor.

363
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,500
He's not coming in!

364
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,625
We're out of range.
I'm not getting anything.

365
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:45,583
- Fuck!

366
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,417
- What's that?
- He's in the car.

367
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,125
What?

368
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,708
- Jeff: Motherfucker.

369
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,417
- Karen: Why's he fucking with us?
- Grab your gun.

370
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,250
Fuck!

371
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,917
Hurry up!
He's in the car already!

372
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,583
Get out of the fucking car!

373
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,250
Get out of there.
Get out of the car!

374
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:13,333
Get out!
Get out of the fucking car!

375
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:14,417
Fuck!

376
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:17,208
Get the fuck out!
Get out of there!

377
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,083
- Fucker!

378
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,708
- You shot the car!

379
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,875
What was I supposed to do?

380
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh my God!

381
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,125
Fuck!

382
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,250
Paul: Shit!

383
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,417
Shit!

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,792
Oh!

385
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:47,042
- Get him!
- He's coming towards us.

386
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,333
Stop or I'll fucking
stab you!

387
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,292
Stop! Stop!

388
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,208
Back off.

389
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,917
Fuck off!
Leave us alone!

390
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,750
Fuck off!

391
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,042
I know. I know.

392
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,542
What else were we gonna do?

393
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,875
First he gets his shit
all over the car,

394
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:25,583
and I don't want him
touching me, you, or anybody.

395
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,792
I think the rain will
put him out.

396
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:30,750
He's dead anyway.
You saw that shit on him.

397
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,000
He looked like he was
skinned alive.

398
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,542
We have to tell the police
it wasn't our fault.

399
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,375
I think we should tell them now.

400
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,333
Calm down.

401
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,875
There's nothing we can do.
The car's fucked.

402
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:48,708
We need a mechanic. We'll find
somebody who knows one,

403
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,250
and then we'll report
the accident.

404
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:54,750
That's the keyword here.
It was an accident.

405
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,042
Paul: The guy's skin...

406
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,042
holy shit.

407
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,625
You should clean up some
of this shit while we're gone.

408
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:06,708
I'll save some for you guys.

409
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,083
- Just stick with the girls.
- What's that supposed to mean?

410
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,708
It means you're
a fucking pussy.

411
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,250
That's fucked up.

412
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:16,333
What's fucked up is you beating
the shit out of my truck.

413
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,958
What about the jag-off
with the rifle?

414
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,167
Did you forget about him?

415
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,083
We all fucked up that car,
don't just put it on me.

416
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,708
Good morning, boys.

417
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:26,583
Are you going
to kill each other now?

418
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:28,792
Where are you going?

419
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,000
To get help.

420
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:15,917
So...
Bert and Jeff are gone.

421
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,375
I know.

422
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:24,375
Last night was
a fucked up situation,

423
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:27,208
- and I think...
- That guy asked for our help.

424
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,083
We lit him on fire.

425
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,833
Can you understand if I'm not
in a particularly social mood?

426
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,792
I got scared.

427
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:41,208
I was...

428
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,667
I was just trying to help.

429
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,625
Karen...

430
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm sorry, Paul.

431
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:58,458
Every time I close my eyes
I see him.

432
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,083
It was an accident.

433
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,792
The guy was going to die
anyway.

434
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:15,500
Better?

435
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,208
Yeah.

436
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,333
Thanks, Paul.

437
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,500
Jeff: Hello?

438
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,083
God damn it!

439
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,250
God damn it!
God damn it!

440
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:32,500
God damn it!

441
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,833
Hold it! You there!

442
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:40,042
Do you see this?!
Do you see this shit?!

443
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,792
We didn't see anything.

444
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:45,500
Tell Murray I can't eat this shit.
Some animal's been running around

445
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,292
infecting everything.

446
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,083
What am I supposed to do
with a sick hog? Huh?

447
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:53,083
I am not about to
eat that meat. Would you?

448
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:56,958
- No, I'm a vegetarian.
- None of this shit is good.

449
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,500
It's all sick.
It's all gotta go back.

450
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,542
I want me a new hog!

451
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,792
We were just looking
for a mechanic.

452
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,917
Mechanic?
You won't find one around here.

453
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:09,417
- You'll have to go to town.
- Bert: That's the thing.

454
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,292
Our car's busted,
so we can't get into town.

455
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,375
We need somebody to take
us into town

456
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,625
- so we can find a mechanic.
- Oh.

457
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:19,667
I've already been
in town today, sorry.

458
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:23,667
All right, if you do go back,
would you tell us?

459
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:26,833
We're staying at a cabin,
and...

460
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,958
we don't know Murray.

461
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,708
Oh, I'm sorry.

462
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,500
Yes, of course,
of course.

463
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:38,458
Why didn't you
just come out and say that?

464
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,708
Come on inside,
I've got a radio.

465
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,958
We'll call Ricky.
He's got a tow truck.

466
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,750
- Call Ricky.
- Ricky.

467
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:47,833
Sorry to bother you, but this
crazy guy came out of the woods

468
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,500
and tried to trash
our car.

469
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:53,792
Woman: Sounds terrible.
I have some juice.

470
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,542
So this person damaged
your car?

471
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:59,833
It was just this crazy hermit.
Real dangerous.

472
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:03,333
- We chased him away with bats.
- It wasn't Henry, was it?

473
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,750
Nah, shit, never.

474
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,083
Henry?

475
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:14,667
My cousin Henry.
He knows about that ordinance.

476
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:17,708
He wouldn't do something like that.
You hit him with a bat?

477
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:19,083
Both: No.

478
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:21,583
No, it wasn't Henry.

479
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:25,125
Our friend Walter, he got drunk.
One thing led to another...

480
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:28,208
- That's no good.
- Yeah.

481
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,583
I've got a great idea. Why don't
we take a walk down ourselves?

482
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:36,208
- It's really nice out.
- We'll just walk.

483
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,958
- I haven't seen the scenery.
- You sure? Ricky's awfully handy.

484
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,208
- Thanks for your help.
- Are you sure?

485
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,458
A little fresh air
sounds great.

486
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,958
We really appreciate your help.
Take care.

487
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,125
We burned Henry.

488
00:34:51,875 --> 00:35:16,708
Fuck!

489
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:39,208
Hello?

490
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:57,167
Hello?

491
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:09,167
Hello?

492
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,958
Hello?

493
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,167
Hello?

494
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,708
Is anyone home?

495
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,250
Hello?

496
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,042
- Ah!

497
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,333
- Bert, you dick-nose.
- Shut up.

498
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,917
What the hell?

499
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,042
- Did you find anybody?
- No, nothing.

500
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,375
I followed the path
that the old guy ran,

501
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:57,042
but I couldn't find him.
He could still be alive.

502
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,875
No, it's impossible.

503
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:03,500
- Want any beef jerky?
- No, put it away.

504
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,500
- Why?
- It's not our house.

505
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,792
So?

506
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,417
- Did you find a phone?
- No.

507
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:14,000
I felt weird looking around.
There's nobody here.

508
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:16,417
We found this other place,
but...

509
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:18,375
there was
nobody there either.

510
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,583
I wonder if the cops
know about it yet.

511
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,625
I doubt it.
If they did know,

512
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:24,667
they'd have been
at the cabin by now.

513
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,625
Good morning.
Deputy Winston,

514
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,708
Bunyan County
Sheriff's Department.

515
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,833
Hi.
What can I do for you?

516
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,833
I'm on patrol
in my jurisdiction

517
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,625
and I heard there was a lot
of commotion here last night.

518
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,625
I wanted to know
what the story is.

519
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:54,083
Yeah, sure. Some guy tried
to break into our cabin.

520
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,292
And he was sick.

521
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,917
I don't know what kind
of disease he had,

522
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,083
but he was a mess.

523
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,208
I have to report this.

524
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,708
Yeah, totally.

525
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:08,125
My friends are out looking for
a neighbor so we could call you.

526
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:10,250
We don't have a phone here.

527
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:13,208
Everyone uses radios.
That's what I use.

528
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,292
Hey...

529
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,750
Looks like you guys were doing
some pretty good partying, huh?

530
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:25,000
Yeah, you know,
we were drinking...

531
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:27,000
and then this guy came along

532
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,458
and tried to break into
the cabin.

533
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,292
We had no choice
but to get rough.

534
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:35,250
I feel awful,
but he was going crazy.

535
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,292
He smashed into our car,

536
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,917
and then he wouldn't come out,
so...

537
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:41,917
we had to hit him.

538
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,917
We hurt him.

539
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,333
We were terrified.
We didn't know what to do.

540
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:48,292
That's why we went
to look for help-

541
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:51,583
Hey, man, I told you...
I'm gonna make a report.

542
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,500
Don't worry about it.
He ain't gonna come back.

543
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:57,042
Looks like you guys
scared him away pretty good.

544
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,250
I ain't gonna let him
ruin your fun.

545
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,042
Thank you.

546
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,542
My friend's inside right now
and she's pretty freaked out.

547
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,417
She wants to go home.

548
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,417
We all kind of do.

549
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:11,958
A lady friend, huh?

550
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,375
I bet you like to party...

551
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,583
with the ladies.

552
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,708
Karen: Paul?

553
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,167
Is everything okay?

554
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:25,833
Howdy, ma'am.
Everything's fine.

555
00:39:25,917 --> 00:39:28,583
Just go back inside,
have yourself a big 40,

556
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,500
just party.

557
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:31,958
Umm...

558
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:36,333
okay.

559
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:42,083
Oh, Daddy, why are you
talking about leaving?

560
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:44,167
You've got to stay and party.

561
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:47,208
That's why we came here
in the first place.

562
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,250
I'm telling you,
this is a major party town.

563
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,250
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?

564
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,292
You know what it's like
when you go

565
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,333
to a new town
and you're the new guy?

566
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:00,125
All the girls see you
walking down the street...

567
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,083
they don't know you've got
five pounds of dangling meat.

568
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:06,208
They're looking for
no commitment.

569
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,833
- You understand what I'm saying?
- I've heard that theory before.

570
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,833
This is that town.

571
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:15,042
It's like when I go party
up at Wambusau.

572
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,042
My cousin goes to school there.

573
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,750
When I party at Wambusau,
I know I'm gonna get pussy.

574
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:24,125
Plus the girls there don't know
I'm a deputy.

575
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:26,792
So I know they're gonna
party hard with me.

576
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,833
Believe me, man,
they do.

577
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:33,458
That's too bad, I bet you ruled
this town before you had a badge.

578
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:36,958
Yeah, but a badge
makes you grow up quick.

579
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:41,625
Shit, this guy went and did
a number on your ride.

580
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,542
I'm gonna put out an APB.
We're gonna catch this guy.

581
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,750
Yeah, it wasn't totally him.

582
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,458
We hit it too.

583
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,125
But we were trying
to scare him away.

584
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:53,500
Could you get somebody
up here to fix it?

585
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,625
What do I look like?
An idiot?

586
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:59,458
I'll have someone up here
by tomorrow afternoon.

587
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,417
You're top priority.
You're the party man.

588
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:05,083
Do you realize how many
great parties we're gonna have?

589
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,042
Fortune's shining on you.

590
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,958
I know where all
the big parties are at.

591
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,958
Remember, my name is Winston.

592
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,208
You know how to
get a hold of me, right?

593
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:18,083
- 9-1-1?
- That's it, my man.

594
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,167
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.

595
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,083
Did he say he was gonna
report this shit or not?

596
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,458
I think he is.
He didn't make it seem like

597
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,500
we did anything wrong. He said
he'd get a tow truck up here.

598
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:53,083
- Sounds weird to me.
- The guy was weird.

599
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:56,542
Once he saw Karen,
he didn't want to leave.

600
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,125
Has Karen left her room yet?

601
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,958
No, she's still sleeping.
I don't know what's up with her.

602
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,083
She wants to get out of here
as soon as she can.

603
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:10,292
- Puts a kink in your plan, huh?
- What plan?

604
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,167
What plan?

605
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:14,958
The plan you've been trying
to execute

606
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,083
since eighth grade.

607
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:20,042
No, there's no plan.
Not anymore.

608
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,333
Whatever.
You guys are funny.

609
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,042
Fucking...

610
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:28,250
she likes you because you're nice
to her and she's nice to you

611
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,292
because she can control you.

612
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:34,833
- Fucking, you're nice to her...
- Bert, don't move.

613
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,500
Bert: Fuck.

614
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,833
- It's that freak's dog.

615
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:47,125
- Should I hit it?
- I don't know.

616
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,333
If you're gonna hit it,
hit it hard.

617
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,292
So where's Grim?

618
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,042
He's out there rotting.
There's some sick shit

619
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:10,333
in the woods and the hermit's
spreading it around.

620
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,750
I'm not waiting for
that deputy to come back.

621
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:15,292
- Let's get out of here now.
- Should we say something

622
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:18,708
on our way out, like, "By the way,
we burned some guy alive"?

623
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,708
- Yes.
- No.

624
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,042
- Jeff.
- Fine, we'll tell the cops.

625
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,667
We have to.
They're gonna figure it out.

626
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:27,708
The deputy knows something happened.
We're the only outsiders.

627
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,333
They're gonna trace it
back to us.

628
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,042
I feel nauseous.

629
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,375
Karen...

630
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,667
How soon can you
get us out of here?

631
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:41,875
I don't know if
I can fix the car.

632
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:45,125
I'm thinking I could
make it drivable,

633
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,917
we could drive into town
and tell them what happened.

634
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,667
And that'll be that, right?

635
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,833
But you're gonna have
to watch me with the gun.

636
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:57,542
I'm not gonna go out there
with that fucking dog around.

637
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,625
I need a bath.

638
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:03,125
Jeff's mom has
the stupidest ideas-

639
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:05,625
"Let's get a cabin."
So gay.

640
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:26,792
Hey.

641
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,000
Hey.

642
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,417
Sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you.

643
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:33,958
That's okay.

644
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,583
I think Marcy made some chili.

645
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,708
I'm not hungry.

646
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:48,250
All right, then.
I'll let you go back to sleep.

647
00:44:48,292 --> 00:44:49,625
No, wait.

648
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,375
Stay.

649
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:04,667
- Fuck.

650
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:09,083
- Why did you stop?
- Would you shoot him already?

651
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,125
Don't stop.
Keep working!

652
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:14,667
- Shoot it!
- If it gets closer, I can hit it.

653
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,958
Just keep working!

654
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:24,125
Oh my God!

655
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,208
Shit!

656
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:33,792
Marcy!

657
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,542
She's got it! She's sick.

658
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,583
Oh no, she's
fucking got it.

659
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:43,625
- Oh shit.
- I think I'm really sick.

660
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,625
Oh shit.
Stay in your fucking bed!

661
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,292
- Bert, can you help me?
- Calm down.

662
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,125
No! Get the fuck out!
Everybody out!

663
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,792
- Just get the fuck out!
- Bert, please!

664
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,958
- Stay in your fucking bed!

665
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,125
- I'm bleeding.
- Get the fuck out!

666
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,625
- Calm down!
- Can I go to the bathroom?

667
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:03,875
Listen, you bitch!
Get the fuck in bed!

668
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:05,458
- Leave her alone!

669
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,333
- Leave her alone!
- Fucking bitch!

670
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:11,417
- What the fuck is your problem?
- She's your fucking friend!

671
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,833
She's sick!
She's not coming near me!

672
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:16,625
I'm doing this for you
and all you fucks!

673
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:19,542
- Don't leave me!
- Stop it!

674
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:22,167
- Bert, Bert... calm down.
- Oh God.

675
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:24,708
- Okay.

676
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:29,208
What?

677
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:11,958
Fuck you, guys.

678
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,333
Karen, I'm sorry.
We just don't want to get it.

679
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:17,292
- I'm going to die in here.
- Paul: No, you're not.

680
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:20,458
Karen, please.
We're going to get help now.

681
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,708
- What about that guy's dog?
- Someone'll keep watch with the gun.

682
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,667
We'll bolt the door shut.

683
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:28,708
Somebody'll be out here.
We won't leave you alone.

684
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:33,208
I want to go home.

685
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,708
Ah!

686
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,333
- Ah!

687
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,417
Karen?

688
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:20,250
Karen.

689
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:35,792
Come on, Karen,
you've got to eat.

690
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,250
Let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

691
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,750
Okay?

692
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,375
Better close the door,
Marcy.

693
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,750
I don't want
to infect everyone.

694
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:03,250
- Oh God.
- What are you doing?

695
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:05,083
My friend...
she's very sick.

696
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:07,875
- You are very sick.
- Oh my God, I'm sorry.

697
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:10,833
- No, I'm-
- That's my wife in there!

698
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:13,417
My friend's dying!
We need a phone, please.

699
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:15,917
- Get the fuck off my property!

700
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,917
- Shit!
- Git!

701
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:27,125
Where have you been?

702
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,750
Did you find anyone?

703
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,500
Well, come on inside.
Marcy made chili.

704
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:40,042
Nobody's hungry?

705
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:46,833
- What if Karen used those bowls?
- Jesus! I washed them!

706
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:50,083
He's right. I'm not gonna eat
until we get back to town.

707
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,750
Jeff: You know, any
of you guys could have it.

708
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:56,167
I know we checked, but I'm
not gonna sleep near you guys.

709
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:58,833
So go sleep in the car
and give us all a break.

710
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,917
The car?
That thing's a germ factory!

711
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:03,958
- I don't even want to ride in it!
- Calm down. I cleaned it.

712
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,500
- So why don't you sleep in it?
- Maybe I will!

713
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,417
You're right. We should
prepare our own meals.

714
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,417
Who am I? I'm melting!

715
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:17,542
I'm burning!

716
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,250
What's your problem?

717
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:20,917
You're gonna
burn down this place!

718
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,208
- What?
- You asshole!

719
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,583
- Fucking prick!
- Marcy: Stop it!

720
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:26,250
- Jeff!
- Motherfucker!

721
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,917
Shut the fuck up!

722
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:34,458
Christ!

723
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,625
I can't take it anymore!

724
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,083
Just no more yelling.

725
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:44,000
We can eat alone,
we can sleep alone. Whatever.

726
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:48,083
We have to talk to each other.
We have to work together.

727
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:52,458
Bert, you just lost the bet.

728
00:54:58,583 --> 00:54:59,708
Shit!

729
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:17,583
Okay, Karen, he's gone.

730
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:21,125
We're gonna stay out here
all night for you, all right?

731
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,208
Karen?

732
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,875
Fuck!

733
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:54,167
Come on, let's go, everybody.
Hurry up!

734
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:56,292
The Jeep's running.
Jeff, come on!

735
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:17,208
Come on, Karen.
We've got to go.

736
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,292
I think I've got a fever.

737
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,333
Let's go!

738
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:19,625
Come on, Jeff,
let's go!

739
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,375
Come on, motherfucker!

740
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,667
All right...
put her in the back.

741
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,000
I don't think
we should sit next to her.

742
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:30,208
Fuck off!
Put her in the front, then.

743
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,542
No, I'm not driving
with her sitting next to me.

744
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:35,625
I'm driving.
Just get in the fucking car.

745
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:37,000
Fine.

746
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:40,958
Paul: Karen?

747
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:44,042
Karen, you okay?

748
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:50,375
- Marcy: Oh God, Karen.

749
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:54,500
Marcy: We've got to get her
to town. She's gonna die.

750
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:55,708
Paul:
She's not going anywhere.

751
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:58,708
Come on.
You guys coming?

752
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,833
Are you nuts?
She just infected the car.

753
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:04,583
- I'll take my chances, man.
- I can't leave Karen.

754
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,833
- Bert, you don't look so hot.
- I don't feel so hot either.

755
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:12,333
But the longer we sit here,
the more she lies and rots!

756
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:14,833
How sick are you?
Did that old guy touch you?

757
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,167
This is fucking horseshit!
Come on!

758
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:20,000
- Did he?
- Fuck this, man!

759
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:25,000
Bert: I'll get her
a fucking doctor.

760
00:58:25,042 --> 00:58:27,375
Marcy: We should move her
back to the shed.

761
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,292
Oh God, she's bleeding again.

762
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:41,167
Don't move her.

763
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,208
It's okay, Karen.
We're gonna get help.

764
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:53,292
- Going somewhere?
- Anywhere but here.

765
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,583
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

766
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:05,667
Jeff?

767
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,542
- Just let him go.
- Jeff!

768
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:08,667
Jeff!

769
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:10,542
Don't fucking
come near me. Stop!

770
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:14,333
I don't want to get sick.
I don't want any of us getting sick!

771
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,500
But you two fuckers
insist on touching her!

772
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:18,708
Now she's bleeding
all over both you guys.

773
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,167
So you two can fucking rot!
But not me!

774
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,417
No fucking way!
Not me!

775
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,125
Asshole!

776
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,583
Oh shit.

777
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:00,542
We're all going to get it.

778
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,625
We're all going
to get sick...

779
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:06,000
and Jeff's in the woods
getting drunk.

780
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:12,750
Bert's going to get help.

781
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:17,167
Karen will be fine.
I promise.

782
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:19,375
It's like being on a plane

783
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:21,708
when you know
it's going to crash.

784
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:25,250
Everyone around you
is screaming and yelling,

785
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:28,292
"We're going down!
We're going down!"

786
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,417
All you really want to do

787
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,958
is grab the person next to you
and fuck the shit out of them

788
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:37,958
'cause you know you're
gonna be dead soon anyway.

789
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:46,208
- You don't use condoms?
- Don't worry. I'm healthy.

790
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:14,500
Oh fuck!

791
01:01:46,042 --> 01:01:47,583
Hello?

792
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:50,000
Somebody help! Hello!

793
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,958
What the hell
happened to you?

794
01:01:55,417 --> 01:01:58,000
My friend, she's sick.

795
01:01:58,042 --> 01:02:00,458
- You don't look so good.
- I know.

796
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,417
There's this disease.

797
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,792
I think all my
friends are getting it.

798
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:08,167
Do you know where
a hospital is around?

799
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,375
Yeah.

800
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:12,708
Stay right there.
Don't come any closer.

801
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,583
I'll get a doctor.

802
01:02:14,625 --> 01:02:16,875
Bert: Thanks.

803
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:18,583
Pancakes!

804
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:21,917
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes.

805
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:25,083
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes!

806
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:37,708
Dennis, I told you
to stay on the swing!

807
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:40,625
Dennis!

808
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:51,042
Fuck!

809
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:56,625
God damn it!
What pancakes!

810
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,583
Why did you come here?

811
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:01,833
Now look what you've done.

812
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,917
I just need a doctor, okay?

813
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:06,375
Look what you've done
to this poor boy!

814
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:09,375
- What has he done to you?
- I just need...

815
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,750
a fucking doctor, man!

816
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:14,083
I already lost one boy.

817
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,042
I ain't losing another.

818
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,583
What if the doctors
can't fix my boy?

819
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:22,250
You get my boy sick,
it's the same as killing him.

820
01:03:22,292 --> 01:03:24,833
- It's murder!
- What?!

821
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:28,500
You being sick,
that's your problem.

822
01:03:28,542 --> 01:03:31,958
Now Dennis is sick,
that's my problem!

823
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,458
And if I get sick,
that's Lucille's problem.

824
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,500
So we got to stop
the problem.

825
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:42,000
We got to stop
the problem right now!

826
01:03:42,042 --> 01:03:44,083
Fenster! Rifle!

827
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:45,625
Fuck you, man!

828
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,625
There are some kids in a cabin.
They got a disease.

829
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,583
They just gave it to Dennis.

830
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,792
We'll need the kit.

831
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,417
Jesus, Paul,
you did a number on my back.

832
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,750
I'm gonna go find Jeff
and we're walking out of here.

833
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,792
- What about Bert?
- I can't wait for him.

834
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:17,667
- I have to get out of here.
- What about Karen? Paul?

835
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,167
- Fuck!

836
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,708
Fuck!

837
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:03,292
Fuck! Fuck!

838
01:06:22,792 --> 01:06:24,500
Oh, fuck!

839
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:01,708
Shit.

840
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:35,208
Up here!

841
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,708
Help me!

842
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:14,125
- Bert!
- They're coming for you.

843
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:18,500
- Who? The deputy?
- No, the guy from the store.

844
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:40,500
I knew these kids were trouble
the minute they stole from Cad.

845
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,583
Good God.

846
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:45,292
They're doing sacrifices
or something.

847
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:47,250
This ain't Christian.

848
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:22,458
Good night, fucker!

849
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,125
Got him.

850
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:04,583
Jeff!

851
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:07,750
Jeff! It's the water!

852
01:13:07,792 --> 01:13:11,000
Wherever you are,
don't drink the water!

853
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,792
Hello?

854
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,208
Jeff?

855
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:53,667
Jeff!

856
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,333
Jeff?

857
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,042
Fuck!

858
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,000
¢Ü So cheer up,
things will get better... ¢Ü

859
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:11,208
Here, have a big beer.

860
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,083
Come on, drink up.

861
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:15,583
You've got some sexy hair.

862
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:18,292
You got sexy shoes, too.

863
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,292
Shit, what the fuck
happened to you, man?

864
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:39,667
The tow truck.

865
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:41,708
What happened to
the tow truck, Winston?

866
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,167
Oh shit.

867
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:46,292
The fucking party man.

868
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,500
I'm so fucking sorry
about the tow truck.

869
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:51,000
I sent it, it broke down.
I had to get a tow truck

870
01:16:51,042 --> 01:16:52,917
to get that fucking
tow truck.

871
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:54,458
What do you need,
you need a ride?

872
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,083
Yeah.

873
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,333
Yeah, a ride would be good.

874
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,333
Radio: Winston!

875
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:04,042
- Winston, do you copy?
- Yes, sir, I copy.

876
01:17:04,083 --> 01:17:06,250
I'm still looking for
that underage booze party.

877
01:17:06,292 --> 01:17:08,958
Radio: Never mind.
We've got bigger problems.

878
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:11,875
Some kids up in a cabin
are on a killing spree.

879
01:17:11,917 --> 01:17:14,417
There's two,
possibly three casualties.

880
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,208
They are armed and hostile.
Do not go anywhere near them!

881
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,417
They've got some kind of skin virus
that will eat you alive.

882
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:23,792
So if you do see them,
do not hesitate to shoot them.

883
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:26,792
- Do you copy?
- Yes. Can you repeat the last part?

884
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:31,583
I said, if you see the kids,
just shoot them on sight!

885
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:40,375
So, how about that ride?

886
01:17:40,458 --> 01:17:43,167
What the fuck?
Just shoot him!

887
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:46,208
- Hey, I can't.
- You heard the walkie-talkie dude!

888
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:49,250
- The fucking gun is in the car.
- I just want to get into town.

889
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:52,250
- Why don't you just relax?
- Get away, fucking fruitcake!

890
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,458
You're not going anyplace!

891
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,542
- Fuck!
- Shit.

892
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:04,708
Come on, be cool.
Be cool.

893
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:08,250
Oh fuck!

894
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:23,542
You fucking idiot!

895
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:27,250
You just fucked up the whole
party, you fucking idiot!

896
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,875
The party's over, Winston.

897
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:28,542
Man: Son.

898
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:31,833
We need you to start
from the beginning.

899
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,542
Everybody's dead.

900
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:43,708
We need to know...

901
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:46,417
where you got this disease.

902
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:49,750
It was a guy
from the woods.

903
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:56,042
Oh God, he looked
like Bert's marshmallow.

904
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:02,500
Paul: He told me
he would get a tow truck.

905
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:06,792
I should have killed him too.

906
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:19,458
Doctor: We're not equipped
to handle a situation like this.

907
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,500
Cook County is
his only shot.

908
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:23,667
Fine.

909
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:26,125
You put him in the car...

910
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:29,042
and I'll take care of him.

911
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,792
Hey, look who's waking up!

912
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:39,917
The fucking party man!

913
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,167
I guess the party
ain't over, huh?

914
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,417
We have a long night
of partying.

915
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,958
- A long night.
- Water.

916
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,583
- I ain't got no water.

917
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,958
All I got's a 40.
But if you want some water,

918
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,958
I'll find some
for you, okay?

919
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,125
You just sit tight,
I'll take care of you.

920
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:45,792
Holy shit.

921
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:38,125
They're dead.

922
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,750
My God.

923
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:44,542
All dead.

924
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,500
I made it.

925
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:54,792
I made it.

926
01:24:57,417 --> 01:24:59,667
Oh God, I made it.

927
01:25:01,542 --> 01:25:03,083
I did it.

928
01:25:03,167 --> 01:25:05,708
I fucking made it.

929
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,500
I fucking made it.

930
01:25:09,542 --> 01:25:11,417
I did it.

931
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:14,042
I fucking made it!

932
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:15,708
I knew it!

933
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:19,208
I knew it!
I fucking made it!

934
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:23,708
I fucking made it!

935
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:27,833
I made it!

936
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:30,375
I fucking made it!

937
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:50,375
You got rid
of that other one, right?

938
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:55,583
Hey, I think there's another one
in the basement.

939
01:25:58,917 --> 01:26:00,708
Come on, boys!

940
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,667
Let's do this!

941
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:49,625
Hey, fellas!

942
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:52,375
It's been a rough morning
up here.

943
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:53,708
Lemonade, mister?

944
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,250
Thanks, son.
Don't mind if I do.

945
01:26:55,292 --> 01:26:57,792
That's five cents.

946
01:26:57,833 --> 01:27:00,583
Businessmen.

947
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:03,292
You almost take
after your granddad.

948
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:05,708
Cad: They're running me out
of my own business.

949
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,083
Stealing me blind right here.

950
01:27:08,167 --> 01:27:11,792
Whoa! Now,
that is mighty fine.

951
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,167
Mighty fine. Grab a cup, boys.
This round's on me.

952
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:41,083
Here you go, all
polished and everything.

953
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:43,083
Ain't that a beauty?
Look at that, honey.

954
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,000
Looks like it's brand new.

955
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:48,000
- Hi, my nigga, how are you?
- What's up, nigga?

956
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,250
Where you been, man?
