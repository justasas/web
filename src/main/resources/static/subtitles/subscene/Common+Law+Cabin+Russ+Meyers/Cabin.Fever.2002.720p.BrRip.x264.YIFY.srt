4
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,360
Hey, boy!

5
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Come on, boy.

6
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,640
Hey!

7
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,640
Hey!

8
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,360
Hey, fella.

9
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,480
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

10
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
No more fucking finals!

11
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey, don't do it!
Don't go to college.

12
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,920
It's a fucking scam.
It fucking sucks!

13
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,320
- Bert, got any more smokes?
- No.

14
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,200
So I'm fat. So what?
I hope she's not anorexic.

15
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,120
Put her there, sport!

16
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,920
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

17
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,960
- Jesus!
- God damn it, Dennis, no!

18
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
No, Dennis, no!

19
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,560
No, don't hit him
or anything.

20
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,080
Everybody knows not
to sit next to Dennis.

21
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,080
- He'll give you tetanus.
- Maybe you should make a sign.

22
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,480
There's a stream around back,
if you want to wash your hand.

23
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,440
I'll get you a towel.

24
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,920
Hey, pal,

25
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,400
do you think it's a smart idea
leaving your kid here

26
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,120
where he might be
a danger to people?

27
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,800
What are you saying exactly?

28
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,840
I'm just saying,
if such an incident

29
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,240
were to bring about a "lawsuit,"

30
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,840
- you might be held liable.
- Jeff, save it for law school.

31
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,440
Cute kid.

32
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,800
Hey.

33
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,360
What's your name?

34
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,640
Yeah!

35
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,760
If you're interested
in really good glasswork,

36
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,080
it's cheap,
but it's an antique.

37
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,760
Some of those bottles
up there

38
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,160
are dated
before the Civil War.

39
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,120
And over there,
I used to have-

40
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,080
in that empty space,
I used to have

41
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,880
some of the prettiest
Shirley Temple bottles I've ever seen.

42
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,600
And this woman came in here
with the palsy, the poor soul.

43
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,720
She thought
they were so cute,

44
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,800
and she reached for them
and knocked every one down

45
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,360
and broke them all
to damn pieces.

46
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,760
So I took her in the back and gave her
some coke and ammonia.

47
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
I thought she was
gonna have a spell.

48
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
We should get something
for your mom to say thanks.

49
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
How about some fox piss?

50
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,960
- My mom would love fox piss.
- Oh Lord, don't drop that.

51
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,320
If you do,
that's powerful stuff.

52
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,880
All the foxes around
would come down here.

53
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,360
You'd have friends
you'd never had before.

54
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,440
You all here for a vacation?

55
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,040
Yeah, we're renting
a cabin for a week.

56
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
That's nice. And if you go
in the woods...

57
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,960
- be very careful.
- Why, what's in the woods?

58
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Tommy, get those kids
their sandwiches.

59
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,960
They're all wrapped up.

60
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,760
- So, what's the fox urine for?
- That's for foxes.

61
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,720
- What's the rifle for?
- That's for niggers.

62
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Okay, let's see.
Let's give you those sandwiches now.

63
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,680
I think we're about ready
to get y'all out of here.

64
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,080
- That's $56 even.
- Okay.

65
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,040
Anything I can do
for you, friend?

66
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
No, I think that's...

67
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,520
Thank you.

68
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,600
You all have
a good vacation now.

69
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,360
- You too.
- Come back and see me.

70
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,840
Thanks a lot, man.
You have a nice day.

71
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,160
Did that guy
just say, "nigger"?

72
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,040
Yeah, you
don't have to repeat it.

73
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
You can call it the "n" word.

74
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,600
Hey.

75
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,640
Boy, you want to give me
one good reason

76
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,760
why you would steal
a Snickers bar.

77
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,760
The nougat?

78
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,400
Sorry, man.
My bad.

79
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,000
All right. Enjoy.

80
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,240
Thanks.

81
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,520
What?

82
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,040
Moron.

83
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,760
What's wrong with you, dude?

84
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
Sorry.

85
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,480
I should burn his fucking
store down, the racist fuck!

86
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,400
- All right, make a left.
- Here?

87
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,560
- Make a left.
- Where else am I gonna go?

88
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,080
- Oh, and then down here...
- Stop the car!

89
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,760
Stop, stop!

90
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,680
I left my Mott's apple juice
back at the store!

91
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,680
- Oh my God.
- Come on!

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,560
- No, we're not going back.
- Come on!

93
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm sure this river
is in the map, right?

94
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,120
Yes!

95
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,120
There's no way
that this is on the map.

96
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,920
It is on the map.
Do you want to look?

97
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
This map's for Cincinnati.

98
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,360
Shut up.

99
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,080
Fine, fuck it.
We'll go this way.

100
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,600
Oh my gosh. Wow.

101
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,640
"Welcome, y'all.

102
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,400
Enjoy your vacation
from all of us

103
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
at Bunyan Mountain Getaways."

104
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,560
Oh my God, Jeff,
check it out.

105
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,880
It's so cute- this little room,
this little bed...

106
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,480
lts view is so beautiful.

107
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
The view of the shrubs...

108
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,040
and the bush
and the antlers.

109
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,240
It's gonna be so perfect.
We're here for a week,

110
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,720
and there's no one
to bother us.

111
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,360
Who's up for a dip?

112
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,280
We're- they're-

113
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,520
Yeah. Safe sex.

114
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,400
- Eh, Paul?
- Yeah?

115
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,440
Have fun.

116
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,360
It's kind of sweet,
you know?

117
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,440
They seem pretty in love.

118
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,760
Bert, what the hell is that?

119
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,400
Huh? I'm gonna go shoot
some squirrels.

120
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Why would you want
to kill squirrels?

121
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,240
- 'Cause they're gay.
- Don't be a fucking retard.

122
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Kidding. I don't care if
they're gay or straight.

123
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,320
- I'll kill them either way.
- Will you be careful with that?

124
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,800
Would you relax, man?
It's a fucking BB gun. Relax.

125
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,880
Sorry.

126
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,440
So, Karen...

127
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,200
how long have we
known each other?

128
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,440
Seventh grade, right?

129
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,640
Yeah.

130
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,440
I was thinking, we've known
each other for so long,

131
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
and even though we-

132
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,400
That's hot!

133
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,480
And, even though we've
always been good friends,

134
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
we never actually-

135
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,480
I've always thought
you were really cool.

136
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,680
Hey, race you to the raft.

137
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,960
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la ¢Ü

138
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,720
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la la la... ¢Ü

139
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:33,880
Fuck!

140
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,880
Oh my God!

141
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,880
¢Ü La la la la la
la la la la la la... ¢Ü

142
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,520
Oh, feels fucking great!

143
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,360
- You like that?
- Yeah!

144
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,720
I'm sorry.
Oh yeah!

145
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,880
So you know Ken Webb?

146
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,800
Yeah.

147
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,720
Short, greasy Ken.

148
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,280
The guy with the CDs, right?

149
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,560
Yeah.

150
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,360
He tried to kiss me.

151
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,120
- He did?
- Yeah.

152
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,920
Two days ago.

153
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,920
This guy I've known
for 12 years,

154
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,760
he's a family friend.

155
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,920
He puts his hands
on my face,

156
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,960
full-on tongue!
It was so gross!

157
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,200
Why, was it gross because
you've known him for so long or...

158
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,440
'cause he's gross?

159
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,000
No, it was definitely him.

160
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I don't know. When you've known
someone a long time,

161
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,760
you just want to kiss them just
to see if they're a good kisser.

162
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,720
There's nothing wrong
with that, right?

163
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:16,200
No.

164
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,760
- Where are you going?
- What's it look like?

165
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,720
- I thought we were kissing.
- Yeah, we were.

166
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,200
So-

167
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,840
so what, you like me now?
Is this like a date?

168
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,480
Don't be gay.

169
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,960
Come back, Mr. Woodchuck.

170
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,880
I'm gonna get you now.

171
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,600
Oh shit.

172
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,560
Oh fuck.

173
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,120
I'm sorry, man.

174
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,800
What?

175
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,720
- Why did you shoot me?
- I thought you were something else.

176
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,440
I didn't- fuck!

177
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
- Are you all right?
- I'm s-

178
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:53,960
sick.

179
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,480
- I need help.
- Oh man.

180
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,440
I'll get you
some help, all right?

181
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,440
I'll be right back.
I got a car.

182
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,080
Oh fuck.

183
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,120
Oh please, help me.

184
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,720
- Fuck.
- I'm sick. I need water.

185
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,400
Just lay down.
Don't move, man.

186
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,320
- Water.
- I'll get you water.

187
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,800
Just stay-
don't come near me, okay?

188
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,520
Is that your-

189
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,480
- is that your cabin?
- No!

190
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,040
Just stay there!
Please, stay there.

191
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Don't make me
fucking shoot you, man.

192
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,720
Just stay the fuck back,
please!

193
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,120
Fuck!

194
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,040
Fuck!

195
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,320
Fuck!

196
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,760
What the fuck, man?
Where were you?

197
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,480
You gonna burn the whole
fucking place down?

198
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,120
What are you,
Smoky the Clown now?

199
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,920
Don't you mean,
Smoky the Bear?

200
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,840
Whatever.
This is horseshit, man.

201
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,160
- It's a fireplace.
- How old are you?

202
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,240
Can't you be responsible
for anything?

203
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,760
We can't leave you alone
for five minutes

204
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,840
without you destroying something!
What were you shooting at?

205
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,800
I heard a squirrel.
I was just looking for a squirrel.

206
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,320
- A squirrel?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,320
- Fucking idiot.
- To stick up his ass.

208
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,360
Why don't you
tell us the story?

209
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,960
What are you gonna roast
on that thing?

210
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,440
Come on, Paul,
tell them story.

211
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,720
No, I can't.
It's a traumatic experience.

212
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,520
- I don't want to talk about it.
- We like traumatic stories.

213
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,440
- Not about me, but...
- Trauma bonds people.

214
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,080
- You can tell us.
- It bonds those who go through it,

215
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,920
- not the people you tell it to.
- Tell the fucking story!

216
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,720
All right!

217
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,600
So there's this bowling alley
when we were growing up.

218
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,600
You guys might remember it-
Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl?

219
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,240
It was in Brighton, right?

220
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,840
That's probably why it was
called Brighton Bowl.

221
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,000
We used to go there
for birthday parties

222
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,440
or with my dad
for the weekend.

223
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,040
This one time, I asked
my dad if we could go.

224
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,560
He's like, "No.
The bowling alley's closed."

225
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,960
This marshmallow's so burnt!

226
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
It turned out there had
been a break-in.

227
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,040
All the employees
were held at gunpoint.

228
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,320
After they had been
gagged and beaten,

229
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,240
they were tied to chairs.

230
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,440
The chairs...
they were set in a circle,

231
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,400
so that way everybody
was forced to watch

232
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,320
everybody else.

233
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,320
And then the robber,

234
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,720
this sick maniac,

235
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
he goes and finds one of those
little ball-peen hammers.

236
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,360
And then one by one...

237
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,840
he smashed the backs
of their heads open with the hammer.

238
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,280
Everyone had to watch
their friends die,

239
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,080
knowing that they'd
soon be next.

240
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,360
Ball-peen...

241
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,920
The guy doesn't stop there.

242
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,280
He breaks out the fire axe.

243
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,160
The alarm goes off...
he doesn't give a shit.

244
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,160
He hacked off
all of their limbs.

245
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,120
The cops found six
bloody torsos

246
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,280
tied to the bowling seats.

247
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,560
Blood everywhere...

248
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,720
Turns out the guy was
some disgruntled employee.

249
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,360
That was
my childhood playground.

250
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,960
Bert, you asshole,
it's not funny.

251
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes it is,
you fucking slut.

252
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:22,960
Jeff?

253
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,320
What?

254
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,560
Tell them about
the happy bald guy.

255
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,000
- No, I can't take it.
- He gave us our shoes

256
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,160
and quarters for
the video games.

257
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,080
There was a room with
a pool table,

258
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,040
but my dad wouldn't
let us go there.

259
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,320
The bald guy was always happy,
always smiling.

260
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,400
But the killer
got him too.

261
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,360
When the cops searched
the place,

262
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,400
they found hacked off limbs
at the end of the bowling lanes.

263
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,400
The guy had bowled
people's organs.

264
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,880
Arms, legs, everything.

265
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,800
They found the bald guy's head
in the ball return.

266
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,920
- He was still smiling.
- Oh, no.

267
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,440
I knew you were full of shit!
You suck!

268
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,920
No! It was in the paper.
I swear!

269
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm laughing because

270
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,720
Jeff is an asshole
and he's making me laugh.

271
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,920
I swear...

272
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,920
I loved this place.
I still remember the sounds...

273
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,000
the cracking,
the bouncing.

274
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,640
The smell of the shoes,
the sound of the Q-Bert machine...

275
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
Holy shit!
What are you doing?!

276
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,200
- I'm cool.
- Are you spying on us?

277
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,440
- I'm cool.
- Is your dog friendly?

278
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,440
Yeah, he's cool.

279
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,360
This is Dr. Mambo.
Here, boy.

280
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,000
Come on, Dr. Mambo.

281
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Is it "Dr." like a physician
or a professor?

282
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
Yeah, he's a professor...

283
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,000
of being a dog.
Oof! Faced!

284
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,800
Scratch-moded.

285
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,720
It's a positive bonfire.

286
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,120
Got room for one more?

287
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Actually, we were having a private
conversation, if you don't mind.

288
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,680
That's cool.

289
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,120
I guess I'll smoke
all this weed by myself.

290
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,440
No, no.
It's fine.

291
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,520
It's not that private.

292
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,480
Awesome.

293
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,080
Yeah, sit right here.

294
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
I think he's gonna
fuck her.

295
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,960
Awesome.

296
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,400
- Wait, so your name was...
- Justin...

297
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
- but you can call me "Grim."
- Grim.

298
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,080
Like Grimace?

299
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,320
"Grim" is my skating name.

300
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,320
I got it in Berkeley while
competing in the X-Games.

301
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,240
Really? Karen's going
to go to Berkeley.

302
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,680
Dude...

303
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,560
awesome.

304
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,280
I love Berkeley.
People there are so wacked.

305
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,080
I met these guys and they had me
fucked up for five days straight.

306
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,440
They wouldn't let me drink
anything but beer.

307
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,960
Yeah, I've done that,
except I did it with JD.

308
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,080
Karen's got a great idea.

309
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,840
We should only drink beer
for the rest of the trip.

310
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,520
I could probably do that,
but I doubt you could.

311
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,040
I'll bet you. I can only drink
beer the rest of the trip.

312
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,120
If I drink anything else,
you can have the rest of my supply.

313
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,440
All right, you're on.
We only drink beer.

314
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,840
You're on.

315
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,360
So, you're a skater?
Is that your occupation?

316
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,360
Oh, crap.

317
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,560
Party's over.

318
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,240
Hey Justin...
Grim...

319
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,160
you want to come inside?

320
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,120
I'd love to, but I left
all this shit outside my tent.

321
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,960
It's starting to rain,
if it gets fucked up,

322
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,880
it's like $4,000 worth
of shit pissed away.

323
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,320
How far away is your tent?

324
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,880
20 minutes away, but if I book
I can be back in 30.

325
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,080
- Cool. Bring the weed.
- I will.

326
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,520
Check you dudes later.
Come on, Dr. Mambo.

327
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,560
- Freak.
- I thought he was funny.

328
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,400
How did it work?

329
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,160
What do you mean "how"?
It had a hose...

330
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,280
a bunch of different settings,

331
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,680
pulse, power...

332
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,160
stream.

333
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,320
And you came every time?

334
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,680
Totally.

335
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,320
You can imagine my disappointment
the first time I had sex.

336
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,400
Tell me about it.

337
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,800
What's that supposed
to mean?

338
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,720
- I've got a better story.
- I'm sorry,

339
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,720
but no story is better
than Karen and the shower massage.

340
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,120
No, seriously.

341
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,160
One time I was masturbating...

342
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,960
and my dog came up
and started licking my balls.

343
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,800
Right as I came it stuck
its tongue up my ass.

344
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,480
That's serious fucking
masturbation talent right there.

345
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,400
Fucking good.

346
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,560
He'd better have brought more weed
or I won't let him in.

347
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,680
Relax, pal.
I'm coming.

348
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,440
His name's Grim.

349
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,480
Jesus Christ.

350
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,720
Help me...
please.

351
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,120
I need a doctor.

352
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,760
Oh shit.

353
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,160
Doctor.

354
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,040
Yeah, all right.

355
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,520
Somebody grab a blanket
or something.

356
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,080
You...

357
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,360
you shot me.

358
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,280
No, no, no.

359
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
There's no way this contagious
fucker's coming in here.

360
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,720
- He's sick, for Christ's sake.
- You want him to come in here

361
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,600
and touch all of your shit,
your fucking soap...?

362
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,520
Let's throw him
a blanket or something.

363
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
- Or your douche?
- Let's drive him to a doctor.

364
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,320
He's not coming in!

365
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
We're out of range.
I'm not getting anything.

366
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,280
- Fuck!

367
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,000
- What's that?
- He's in the car.

368
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,640
What?

369
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,120
- Motherfucker.

370
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,720
- Why's he fucking with us?
- Grab your gun.

371
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,520
Fuck!

372
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,080
Hurry up!
He's in the car already!

373
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,400
Get out of the fucking car!

374
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
Get out of there.
Get out of the car!

375
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,920
Get out!
Get out of the fucking car!

376
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:12,960
Fuck!

377
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,640
Get the fuck out!
Get out of there!

378
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,480
- Fucker!

379
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,000
- You shot the car!

380
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,080
What was I supposed to do?

381
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Oh my God!

382
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,960
Fuck!

383
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,960
Shit!

384
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,920
Shit!

385
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,160
Oh!

386
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,240
- Get him!
- He's coming towards us.

387
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,400
Stop or I'll fucking
stab you!

388
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,280
Stop! Stop!

389
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,040
Back off.

390
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,600
Fuck off!
Leave us alone!

391
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,320
Fuck off!

392
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I know. I know.

393
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,440
What else were we gonna do?

394
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,680
First he gets his shit
all over the car,

395
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,240
and I don't want him
touching me, you, or anybody.

396
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,360
I think the rain will
put him out.

397
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,200
He's dead anyway.
You saw that shit on him.

398
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,360
He looked like he was
skinned alive.

399
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,760
We have to tell the police
it wasn't our fault.

400
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,440
I think we should tell them now.

401
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,320
Calm down.

402
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,760
There's nothing we can do.
The car's fucked.

403
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,440
We need a mechanic. We'll find
somebody who knows one,

404
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,880
and then we'll report
the accident.

405
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,240
That's the keyword here.
It was an accident.

406
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,360
The guy's skin...

407
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,280
holy shit.

408
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,280
You should clean up some
of this shit while we're gone.

409
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,280
I'll save some for you guys.

410
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,560
- Just stick with the girls.
- What's that supposed to mean?

411
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,040
It means you're
a fucking pussy.

412
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,520
That's fucked up.

413
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,480
What's fucked up is you beating
the shit out of my truck.

414
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,040
What about the jag-off
with the rifle?

415
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,200
Did you forget about him?

416
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,000
We all fucked up that car,
don't just put it on me.

417
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,560
Good morning, boys.

418
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,320
Are you going
to kill each other now?

419
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,440
Where are you going?

420
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,560
To get help.

421
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,680
So...
Bert and Jeff are gone.

422
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,000
I know.

423
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,800
Last night was
a fucked up situation,

424
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,520
- and I think...
- That guy asked for our help.

425
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,280
We lit him on fire.

426
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,840
Can you understand if I'm not
in a particularly social mood?

427
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,600
I got scared.

428
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:28,960
I was...

429
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,320
I was just trying to help.

430
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,080
Karen...

431
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,280
I'm sorry, Paul.

432
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,520
Every time I close my eyes
I see him.

433
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,040
It was an accident.

434
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,600
The guy was going to die
anyway.

435
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,840
Better?

436
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,280
Yeah.

437
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
Thanks, Paul.

438
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,600
Hello?

439
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,640
God damn it!

440
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
God damn it!
God damn it!

441
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
God damn it!

442
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,920
Hold it! You there!

443
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,000
Do you see this?!
Do you see this shit?!

444
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,680
We didn't see anything.

445
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,240
Tell Murray I can't eat this shit.
Some animal's been running around

446
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,960
infecting everything.

447
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,640
What am I supposed to do
with a sick hog? Huh?

448
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,520
I am not about to
eat that meat. Would you?

449
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,240
- No, I'm a vegetarian.
- None of this shit is good.

450
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,680
It's all sick.
It's all gotta go back.

451
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,640
I want me a new hog!

452
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,800
We were just looking
for a mechanic.

453
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,800
Mechanic?
You won't find one around here.

454
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,200
- You'll have to go to town.
- That's the thing.

455
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,960
Our car's busted,
so we can't get into town.

456
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,960
We need somebody to take
us into town

457
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,080
- so we can find a mechanic.
- Oh.

458
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,960
I've already been
in town today, sorry.

459
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,800
All right, if you do go back,
would you tell us?

460
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,840
We're staying at a cabin,
and...

461
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
we don't know Murray.

462
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

463
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,160
Yes, of course,
of course.

464
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Why didn't you
just come out and say that?

465
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,160
Come on inside,
I've got a radio.

466
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,320
We'll call Ricky.
He's got a tow truck.

467
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,040
- Call Ricky.
- Ricky.

468
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,000
Sorry to bother you, but this
crazy guy came out of the woods

469
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,560
and tried to trash
our car.

470
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,720
Sounds terrible.
I have some juice.

471
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,360
So this person damaged
your car?

472
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,520
It was just this crazy hermit.
Real dangerous.

473
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,880
- We chased him away with bats.
- It wasn't Henry, was it?

474
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,200
Nah, shit, never.

475
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,360
Henry?

476
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,760
My cousin Henry.
He knows about that ordinance.

477
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,680
He wouldn't do something like that.
You hit him with a bat?

478
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,000
No.

479
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,400
No, it wasn't Henry.

480
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,800
Our friend Walter, he got drunk.
One thing led to another...

481
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,760
- That's no good.
- Yeah.

482
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,920
I've got a great idea. Why don't
we take a walk down ourselves?

483
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,440
- It's really nice out.
- We'll just walk.

484
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,040
- I haven't seen the scenery.
- You sure? Ricky's awfully handy.

485
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,200
- Thanks for your help.
- Are you sure?

486
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,360
A little fresh air
sounds great.

487
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,760
We really appreciate your help.
Take care.

488
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,760
We burned Henry.

489
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:53,320
Fuck!

490
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:14,880
Hello?

491
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:32,120
Hello?

492
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,640
Hello?

493
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,840
Hello?

494
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,920
Hello?

495
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,320
Is anyone home?

496
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,520
Hello?

497
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,160
- Ah!

498
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,320
- Bert, you dick-nose.
- Shut up.

499
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,760
What the hell?

500
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
- Did you find anybody?
- No, nothing.

501
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,040
I followed the path
that the old guy ran,

502
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,600
but I couldn't find him.
He could still be alive.

503
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,360
No, it's impossible.

504
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,800
- Want any beef jerky?
- No, put it away.

505
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,680
- Why?
- It's not our house.

506
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,920
So?

507
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,400
- Did you find a phone?
- No.

508
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,880
I felt weird looking around.
There's nobody here.

509
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,160
We found this other place,
but...

510
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,080
there was
nobody there either.

511
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,200
I wonder if the cops
know about it yet.

512
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,160
I doubt it.
If they did know,

513
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,120
they'd have been
at the cabin by now.

514
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,520
Good morning.
Deputy Winston,

515
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,480
Bunyan County
Sheriff's Department.

516
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,440
Hi.
What can I do for you?

517
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,360
I'm on patrol
in my jurisdiction

518
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,000
and I heard there was a lot
of commotion here last night.

519
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,960
I wanted to know
what the story is.

520
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,320
Yeah, sure. Some guy tried
to break into our cabin.

521
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
And he was sick.

522
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,880
I don't know what kind
of disease he had,

523
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,000
but he was a mess.

524
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
I have to report this.

525
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,480
Yeah, totally.

526
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,760
My friends are out looking for
a neighbor so we could call you.

527
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
We don't have a phone here.

528
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,600
Everyone uses radios.
That's what I use.

529
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Hey...

530
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,840
Looks like you guys were doing
some pretty good partying, huh?

531
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,960
Yeah, you know,
we were drinking...

532
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,840
and then this guy came along

533
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,240
and tried to break into
the cabin.

534
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,960
We had no choice
but to get rough.

535
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,800
I feel awful,
but he was going crazy.

536
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,720
He smashed into our car,

537
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,280
and then he wouldn't come out,
so...

538
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,240
we had to hit him.

539
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,160
We hurt him.

540
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,440
We were terrified.
We didn't know what to do.

541
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,320
That's why we went
to look for help-

542
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,440
Hey, man, I told you...
I'm gonna make a report.

543
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,280
Don't worry about it.
He ain't gonna come back.

544
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,680
Looks like you guys
scared him away pretty good.

545
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,840
I ain't gonna let him
ruin your fun.

546
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,520
Thank you.

547
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,920
My friend's inside right now
and she's pretty freaked out.

548
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,680
She wants to go home.

549
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,600
We all kind of do.

550
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,000
A lady friend, huh?

551
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,320
I bet you like to party...

552
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,480
with the ladies.

553
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,440
Paul?

554
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,800
Is everything okay?

555
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,360
Howdy, ma'am.
Everything's fine.

556
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,000
Just go back inside,
have yourself a big 40,

557
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,840
just party.

558
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,240
Umm...

559
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,440
okay.

560
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,960
Oh, Daddy, why are you
talking about leaving?

561
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,960
You've got to stay and party.

562
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,880
That's why we came here
in the first place.

563
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,720
I'm telling you,
this is a major party town.

564
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,640
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?

565
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,640
You know what it's like
when you go

566
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,560
to a new town
and you're the new guy?

567
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,240
All the girls see you
walking down the street...

568
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,040
they don't know you've got
five pounds of dangling meat.

569
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,080
They're looking for
no commitment.

570
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,560
- You understand what I'm saying?
- I've heard that theory before.

571
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,480
This is that town.

572
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,560
It's like when I go party
up at Wambusau.

573
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,440
My cousin goes to school there.

574
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,000
When I party at Wambusau,
I know I'm gonna get pussy.

575
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,280
Plus the girls there don't know
I'm a deputy.

576
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,840
So I know they're gonna
party hard with me.

577
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,760
Believe me, man,
they do.

578
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,240
That's too bad, I bet you ruled
this town before you had a badge.

579
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,560
Yeah, but a badge
makes you grow up quick.

580
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,040
Shit, this guy went and did
a number on your ride.

581
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,880
I'm gonna put out an APB.
We're gonna catch this guy.

582
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,960
Yeah, it wasn't totally him.

583
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,640
We hit it too.

584
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,200
But we were trying
to scare him away.

585
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,440
Could you get somebody
up here to fix it?

586
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,480
What do I look like?
An idiot?

587
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,200
I'll have someone up here
by tomorrow afternoon.

588
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,040
You're top priority.
You're the party man.

589
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,600
Do you realize how many
great parties we're gonna have?

590
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,440
Fortune's shining on you.

591
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,280
I know where all
the big parties are at.

592
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,160
Remember, my name is Winston.

593
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,320
You know how to
get a hold of me, right?

594
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,080
- 9-1-1?
- That's it, my man.

595
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,040
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.

596
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,920
Did he say he was gonna
report this shit or not?

597
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,240
I think he is.
He didn't make it seem like

598
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,160
we did anything wrong. He said
he'd get a tow truck up here.

599
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,640
- Sounds weird to me.
- The guy was weird.

600
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,960
Once he saw Karen,
he didn't want to leave.

601
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,440
Has Karen left her room yet?

602
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,040
No, she's still sleeping.
I don't know what's up with her.

603
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,040
She wants to get out of here
as soon as she can.

604
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,120
- Puts a kink in your plan, huh?
- What plan?

605
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,920
What plan?

606
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,600
The plan you've been trying
to execute

607
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
since eighth grade.

608
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,480
No, there's no plan.
Not anymore.

609
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,680
Whatever.
You guys are funny.

610
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,280
Fucking...

611
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,360
she likes you because you're nice
to her and she's nice to you

612
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,320
because she can control you.

613
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,680
- Fucking, you're nice to her...
- Bert, don't move.

614
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,120
Fuck.

615
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,360
- It's that freak's dog.

616
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,440
- Should I hit it?
- I don't know.

617
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,600
If you're gonna hit it,
hit it hard.

618
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,920
So where's Grim?

619
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,600
He's out there rotting.
There's some sick shit

620
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,760
in the woods and the hermit's
spreading it around.

621
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,080
I'm not waiting for
that deputy to come back.

622
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,520
- Let's get out of here now.
- Should we say something

623
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,800
on our way out, like, "By the way,
we burned some guy alive"?

624
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,720
- Yes.
- No.

625
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,000
- Jeff.
- Fine, we'll tell the cops.

626
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,520
We have to.
They're gonna figure it out.

627
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,440
The deputy knows something happened.
We're the only outsiders.

628
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,960
They're gonna trace it
back to us.

629
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,520
I feel nauseous.

630
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,800
Karen...

631
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,920
How soon can you
get us out of here?

632
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,000
I don't know if
I can fix the car.

633
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,160
I'm thinking I could
make it drivable,

634
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,840
we could drive into town
and tell them what happened.

635
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,480
And that'll be that, right?

636
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,480
But you're gonna have
to watch me with the gun.

637
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,080
I'm not gonna go out there
with that fucking dog around.

638
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
I need a bath.

639
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,440
Jeff's mom has
the stupidest ideas-

640
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,800
"Let's get a cabin."
So gay.

641
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,120
Hey.

642
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,240
Hey.

643
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,560
Sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you.

644
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,000
That's okay.

645
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,400
I think Marcy made some chili.

646
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,440
I'm not hungry.

647
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,720
All right, then.
I'll let you go back to sleep.

648
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,040
No, wait.

649
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,680
Stay.

650
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,480
- Fuck.

651
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,760
- Why did you stop?
- Would you shoot him already?

652
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,680
Don't stop.
Keep working!

653
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,080
- Shoot it!
- If it gets closer, I can hit it.

654
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,280
Just keep working!

655
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,280
Oh my God!

656
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,200
Shit!

657
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,560
Marcy!

658
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,080
She's got it! She's sick.

659
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,040
Oh no, she's
fucking got it.

660
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,000
- Oh shit.
- I think I'm really sick.

661
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,920
Oh shit.
Stay in your fucking bed!

662
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,440
- Bert, can you help me?
- Calm down.

663
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,200
No! Get the fuck out!
Everybody out!

664
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,720
- Just get the fuck out!
- Bert, please!

665
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,800
- Stay in your fucking bed!

666
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,880
- I'm bleeding.
- Get the fuck out!

667
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,280
- Calm down!
- Can I go to the bathroom?

668
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,440
Listen, you bitch!
Get the fuck in bed!

669
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,960
- Leave her alone!

670
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,720
- Leave her alone!
- Fucking bitch!

671
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,680
- What the fuck is your problem?
- She's your fucking friend!

672
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,000
She's sick!
She's not coming near me!

673
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,680
I'm doing this for you
and all you fucks!

674
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,480
- Don't leave me!
- Stop it!

675
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,000
- Bert, Bert... calm down.
- Oh God.

676
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,440
- Okay.

677
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,760
What?

678
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,320
Fuck you, guys.

679
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,600
Karen, I'm sorry.
We just don't want to get it.

680
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,440
- I'm going to die in here.
- No, you're not.

681
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,480
Karen, please.
We're going to get help now.

682
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,600
- What about that guy's dog?
- Someone'll keep watch with the gun.

683
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,520
We'll bolt the door shut.

684
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,400
Somebody'll be out here.
We won't leave you alone.

685
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,720
I want to go home.

686
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,080
Ah!

687
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,600
- Ah!

688
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,160
Karen?

689
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,840
Karen.

690
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,760
Come on, Karen,
you've got to eat.

691
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,560
Let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

692
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,960
Okay?

693
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,440
Better close the door,
Marcy.

694
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,640
I don't want
to infect everyone.

695
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,680
- Oh God.
- What are you doing?

696
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,440
My friend...
she's very sick.

697
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,120
- You are very sick.
- Oh my God, I'm sorry.

698
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,960
- No, I'm-
- That's my wife in there!

699
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,440
My friend's dying!
We need a phone, please.

700
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,880
- Get the fuck off my property!

701
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,760
- Shit!
- Git!

702
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,600
Where have you been?

703
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,120
Did you find anyone?

704
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,720
Well, come on inside.
Marcy made chili.

705
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,000
Nobody's hungry?

706
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,520
- What if Karen used those bowls?
- Jesus! I washed them!

707
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,640
He's right. I'm not gonna eat
until we get back to town.

708
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,200
You know, any
of you guys could have it.

709
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,480
I know we checked, but I'm
not gonna sleep near you guys.

710
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,040
So go sleep in the car
and give us all a break.

711
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,040
The car?
That thing's a germ factory!

712
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,960
- I don't even want to ride in it!
- Calm down. I cleaned it.

713
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,400
- So why don't you sleep in it?
- Maybe I will!

714
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,080
You're right. We should
prepare our own meals.

715
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,920
Who am I? I'm melting!

716
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,960
I'm burning!

717
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,600
What's your problem?

718
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,200
You're gonna
burn down this place!

719
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,440
- What?
- You asshole!

720
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,760
- Fucking prick!
- Stop it!

721
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,320
- Jeff!
- Motherfucker!

722
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,760
Shut the fuck up!

723
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,200
Christ!

724
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,280
I can't take it anymore!

725
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,560
Just no more yelling.

726
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,360
We can eat alone,
we can sleep alone. Whatever.

727
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,280
We have to talk to each other.
We have to work together.

728
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,480
Bert, you just lost the bet.

729
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,440
Shit!

730
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,560
Okay, Karen, he's gone.

731
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,960
We're gonna stay out here
all night for you, all right?

732
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,920
Karen?

733
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,640
Fuck!

734
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,680
Come on, let's go, everybody.
Hurry up!

735
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,720
The Jeep's running.
Jeff, come on!

736
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,800
Come on, Karen.
We've got to go.

737
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,720
I think I've got a fever.

738
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,680
Let's go!

739
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,720
Come on, Jeff,
let's go!

740
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,400
Come on, motherfucker!

741
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,520
All right...
put her in the back.

742
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,720
I don't think
we should sit next to her.

743
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,840
Fuck off!
Put her in the front, then.

744
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,080
No, I'm not driving
with her sitting next to me.

745
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,040
I'm driving.
Just get in the fucking car.

746
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,360
Fine.

747
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,160
Karen?

748
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,120
Karen, you okay?

749
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,200
- Oh God, Karen.

750
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,160
We've got to get her
to town. She's gonna die.

751
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,320
She's not going anywhere.

752
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,200
Come on.
You guys coming?

753
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,240
Are you nuts?
She just infected the car.

754
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,840
- I'll take my chances, man.
- I can't leave Karen.

755
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,920
- Bert, you don't look so hot.
- I don't feel so hot either.

756
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,280
But the longer we sit here,
the more she lies and rots!

757
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,680
How sick are you?
Did that old guy touch you?

758
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,920
This is fucking horseshit!
Come on!

759
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,600
- Did he?
- Fuck this, man!

760
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,400
I'll get her
a fucking doctor.

761
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,680
We should move her
back to the shed.

762
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,120
Oh God, she's bleeding again.

763
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,960
Don't move her.

764
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,840
It's okay, Karen.
We're gonna get help.

765
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,560
- Going somewhere?
- Anywhere but here.

766
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,400
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

767
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,440
Jeff?

768
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,240
- Just let him go.
- Jeff!

769
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,320
Jeff!

770
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,120
Don't fucking
come near me. Stop!

771
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,760
I don't want to get sick.
I don't want any of us getting sick!

772
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,840
But you two fuckers
insist on touching her!

773
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,960
Now she's bleeding
all over both you guys.

774
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,320
So you two can fucking rot!
But not me!

775
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,480
No fucking way!
Not me!

776
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,040
Asshole!

777
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,720
Oh shit.

778
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,080
We're all going to get it.

779
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,040
We're all going
to get sick...

780
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,320
and Jeff's in the woods
getting drunk.

781
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,800
Bert's going to get help.

782
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,040
Karen will be fine.
I promise.

783
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,160
It's like being on a plane

784
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,440
when you know
it's going to crash.

785
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,800
Everyone around you
is screaming and yelling,

786
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,720
"We're going down!
We're going down!"

787
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,760
All you really want to do

788
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,120
is grab the person next to you
and fuck the shit out of them

789
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,000
'cause you know you're
gonna be dead soon anyway.

790
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,920
- You don't use condoms?
- Don't worry. I'm healthy.

791
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,080
Oh fuck!

792
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,800
Hello?

793
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,120
Somebody help! Hello!

794
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,920
What the hell
happened to you?

795
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,800
My friend, she's sick.

796
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,160
- You don't look so good.
- I know.

797
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,080
There's this disease.

798
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,320
I think all my
friends are getting it.

799
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,560
Do you know where
a hospital is around?

800
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,720
Yeah.

801
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,920
Stay right there.
Don't come any closer.

802
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,720
I'll get a doctor.

803
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,920
Thanks.

804
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,560
Pancakes!

805
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,760
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes.

806
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,800
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes!

807
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,880
Dennis, I told you
to stay on the swing!

808
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,680
Dennis!

809
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,680
Fuck!

810
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,040
God damn it!
What pancakes!

811
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,840
Why did you come here?

812
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,040
Now look what you've done.

813
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,040
I just need a doctor, okay?

814
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,400
Look what you've done
to this poor boy!

815
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,280
- What has he done to you?
- I just need...

816
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,600
a fucking doctor, man!

817
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,800
I already lost one boy.

818
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,680
I ain't losing another.

819
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,120
What if the doctors
can't fix my boy?

820
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,640
You get my boy sick,
it's the same as killing him.

821
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,120
- It's murder!
- What?!

822
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,640
You being sick,
that's your problem.

823
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,960
Now Dennis is sick,
that's my problem!

824
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,320
And if I get sick,
that's Lucille's problem.

825
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,240
So we got to stop
the problem.

826
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,600
We got to stop
the problem right now!

827
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,600
Fenster! Rifle!

828
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,080
Fuck you, man!

829
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,640
There are some kids in a cabin.
They got a disease.

830
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,520
They just gave it to Dennis.

831
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,560
We'll need the kit.

832
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,920
Jesus, Paul,
you did a number on my back.

833
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,160
I'm gonna go find Jeff
and we're walking out of here.

834
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,080
- What about Bert?
- I can't wait for him.

835
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,800
- I have to get out of here.
- What about Karen? Paul?

836
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,840
- Fuck!

837
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,320
Fuck!

838
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,600
Fuck! Fuck!

839
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,520
Oh, fuck!

840
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,200
Shit.

841
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,360
Up here!

842
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,680
Help me!

843
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,400
- Bert!
- They're coming for you.

844
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,600
- Who? The deputy?
- No, the guy from the store.

845
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,720
I knew these kids were trouble
the minute they stole from Cad.

846
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,720
Good God.

847
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,320
They're doing sacrifices
or something.

848
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,200
This ain't Christian.

849
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,960
Good night, fucker!

850
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,520
Got him.

851
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,360
Jeff!

852
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,440
Jeff! It's the water!

853
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,520
Wherever you are,
don't drink the water!

854
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,760
Hello?

855
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,600
Jeff?

856
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,520
Jeff!

857
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,720
Jeff?

858
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,600
Fuck!

859
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,320
¢Ü So cheer up,
things will get better... ¢Ü

860
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,480
Here, have a big beer.

861
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,280
Come on, drink up.

862
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,680
You've got some sexy hair.

863
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,280
You got sexy shoes, too.

864
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,520
Shit, what the fuck
happened to you, man?

865
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,800
The tow truck.

866
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,760
What happened to
the tow truck, Winston?

867
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,120
Oh shit.

868
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,160
The fucking party man.

869
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,240
I'm so fucking sorry
about the tow truck.

870
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,680
I sent it, it broke down.
I had to get a tow truck

871
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,520
to get that fucking
tow truck.

872
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,960
What do you need,
you need a ride?

873
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,520
Yeah.

874
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,680
Yeah, a ride would be good.

875
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,640
Winston!

876
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,200
- Winston, do you copy?
- Yes, sir, I copy.

877
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,320
I'm still looking for
that underage booze party.

878
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,920
Never mind.
We've got bigger problems.

879
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,680
Some kids up in a cabin
are on a killing spree.

880
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,080
There's two,
possibly three casualties.

881
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,800
They are armed and hostile.
Do not go anywhere near them!

882
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,880
They've got some kind of skin virus
that will eat you alive.

883
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:18,120
So if you do see them,
do not hesitate to shoot them.

884
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,000
- Do you copy?
- Yes. Can you repeat the last part?

885
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:25,600
I said, if you see the kids,
just shoot them on sight!

886
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,040
So, how about that ride?

887
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,720
What the fuck?
Just shoot him!

888
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,640
- Hey, I can't.
- You heard the walkie-talkie dude!

889
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,560
- The fucking gun is in the car.
- I just want to get into town.

890
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,440
- Why don't you just relax?
- Get away, fucking fruitcake!

891
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,560
You're not going anyplace!

892
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,560
- Fuck!
- Shit.

893
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,400
Come on, be cool.
Be cool.

894
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,800
Oh fuck!

895
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,480
You fucking idiot!

896
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,040
You just fucked up the whole
party, you fucking idiot!

897
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,520
The party's over, Winston.

898
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,400
Son.

899
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,560
We need you to start
from the beginning.

900
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,000
Everybody's dead.

901
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,920
We need to know...

902
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,560
where you got this disease.

903
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,760
It was a guy
from the woods.

904
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,800
Oh God, he looked
like Bert's marshmallow.

905
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,960
He told me
he would get a tow truck.

906
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,120
I should have killed him too.

907
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,280
We're not equipped
to handle a situation like this.

908
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,240
Cook County is
his only shot.

909
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,320
Fine.

910
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,640
You put him in the car...

911
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,480
and I'll take care of him.

912
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,840
Hey, look who's waking up!

913
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,880
The fucking party man!

914
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,040
I guess the party
ain't over, huh?

915
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,200
We have a long night
of partying.

916
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,640
- A long night.
- Water.

917
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,120
- I ain't got no water.

918
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,440
All I got's a 40.
But if you want some water,

919
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,400
I'll find some
for you, okay?

920
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,360
You just sit tight,
I'll take care of you.

921
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,600
Holy shit.

922
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,840
They're dead.

923
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,320
My God.

924
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,000
All dead.

925
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,720
I made it.

926
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,880
I made it.

927
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,560
Oh God, I made it.

928
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,840
I did it.

929
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,360
I fucking made it.

930
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,000
I fucking made it.

931
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,840
I did it.

932
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,360
I fucking made it!

933
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,920
I knew it!

934
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,320
I knew it!
I fucking made it!

935
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,640
I fucking made it!

936
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,600
I made it!

937
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,040
I fucking made it!

938
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,200
You got rid
of that other one, right?

939
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,240
Hey, I think there's another one
in the basement.

940
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,120
Come on, boys!

941
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,960
Let's do this!

942
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,080
Hey, fellas!

943
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,720
It's been a rough morning
up here.

944
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,000
Lemonade, mister?

945
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,480
Thanks, son.
Don't mind if I do.

946
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,920
That's five cents.

947
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,600
Businessmen.

948
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,200
You almost take
after your granddad.

949
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,560
They're running me out
of my own business.

950
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,800
Stealing me blind right here.

951
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:42,360
Whoa! Now,
that is mighty fine.

952
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,520
Mighty fine. Grab a cup, boys.
This round's on me.

953
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,440
Here you go, all
polished and everything.

954
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,360
Ain't that a beauty?
Look at that, honey.

955
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,200
Looks like it's brand new.

956
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,080
- Hi, my nigga, how are you?
- What's up, nigga?

957
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,240
Where you been, man?

958
01:24:37,160 --> 01:29:19,240
