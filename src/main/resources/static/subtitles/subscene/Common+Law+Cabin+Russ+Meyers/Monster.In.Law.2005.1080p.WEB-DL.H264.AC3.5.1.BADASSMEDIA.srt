00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:53,999
I'm sorry about before.

183
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:56,100
I didn't mean to be eavesdropping.

184
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,970
Oh, you're right.
You shouldn't have.

185
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,385
You should have stayed
and talked to me.

186
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:03,385
Well, your girlfriend
seemed pretty offended.

187
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,307
Oh no, that's...
that's not my girlfriend.

188
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,846
I don't have a...
I'm single...

189
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:09,538
I don't have a girlfriend.

190
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,974
What?

191
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:13,836
Nothing.

192
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:16,326
Nothing. Um, I'm Charlie.

193
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:17,362
Charlotte, but Charlie.

194
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,724
Well, I'm Kevin.

195
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:20,611
Nice to meet you.

196
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:21,888
Nice to meet you, too.

197
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:22,582
Yeah.

198
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:23,812
Uh-oh.

199
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:25,799
What?

200
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:27,487
What does "uh-oh" mean?

201
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,998
It looks like someone else
is mowing your lawn, Fiona.

202
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,645
I'm gonna go destroy these.

203
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:43,049
Excuse me.
I'll see you guys.

204
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,525
Oh, my shoes are killing me

205
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,546
which means
they must look fabulous.

206
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:54,021
Can I get you anything?

207
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:56,344
One of him on a platter.

208
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,908
Such a waste.

209
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,360
What's a waste?

210
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,589
Oh, you didn't know?

211
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:05,402
Kevin's gay.

212
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,450
What?

213
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:08,909
Yeah.

214
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:11,209
That's Kit, the groom.

215
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,242
Or maybe he's the bride.
I can't remember

216
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:16,608
which one's the top
and which one's the bottom.

217
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:19,475
Yeah, they're getting married
next Christmas in Maui.

218
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:24,139
I didn't get that vibe.

219
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:26,098
Trust me.

220
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:29,513
Thanks.

221
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:36,286
Look at that dude's arms!

222
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:38,498
I used to have
such a good gaydar.

223
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:05,922
Oh, you're home.
Thank God.

224
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:07,822
I'm exhausted.

225
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,236
What did you do today?
- Hi, it's Charlie. Leave a message.

226
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,022
Went to the post office.

227
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,011
Hi, Charlie.

228
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:15,032
- This is Kevin Fields.
- That's him.

229
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,460
I don't know if you remember me
from the party the other night,

230
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:21,925
but I was just calling,
to see if...

231
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,284
maybe... maybe you wanted
to walk my dog.

232
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,537
What? No!

233
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,753
Oh, hang up the phone.

234
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:33,102
No, actually, no, you can't,
'cause I don't have a dog. So...

235
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,721
maybe you could walk me.

236
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:39,622
Hang it up.

237
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,733
All right, you know,
I'm gonna go now.

238
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,147
Just call me at 555-0118
and ask for Dr. Fields, okay?

239
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,185
Thanks. Bye.

240
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:50,261
Oh man, that was...

241
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:51,056
That was horrible.

242
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:53,333
Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath
for a callback on that.

243
00:11:53,358 --> 00:11:55,847
Yeah. Well, she'll call me back
if she wants to walk an idiot.

244
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,501
Yeah, I'm not gonna disagree with you.

245
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:06,083
So takeout
or raid your fridge?

246
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:10,351
Here we go.

247
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:14,037
Take it easy, Lilly.

248
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:15,703
Easy.

249
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:24,652
Hi.

250
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,432
You never called me back so I figured
I'd bring the coffee to you.

251
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:31,098
Thanks. Um...

252
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:34,769
Look, I think you're a really nice guy
and everything, but...

253
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,592
I don't know why
you called me.

254
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:38,193
You know? I'm a woman.

255
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,543
Yeah, I love that fact.

256
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,134
Have you ever been
with a woman?

257
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:48,547
Excuse me?

258
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:50,534
I mean, have you only
ever been with men?

259
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,117
Men?
What are you talking...

260
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:54,894
Whoa whoa whoa.
Wait a minute, I'm not gay.

261
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,883
You're not?

262
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:56,674
No.

263
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:59,941
No, I like women.
Lots of... no, not lots of women,

264
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:01,480
but you know what I mean.

265
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:03,652
Why did you think
I was gay?

266
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:06,801
Awkward.

267
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:09,143
Okay, I got to go now.

268
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:10,846
Wait wait.
Wait wait wait.

269
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:13,050
Okay, I'll prove to you
that I'm not gay, okay?

270
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,819
Let me take you out on Friday night.
We'll watch the playoffs,

271
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:18,141
I'll order a pizza,
I'll completely ignore you.

272
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:22,064
Give me one good reason.

273
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,478
'Cause I'm different.

274
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,932
Really?

275
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:29,917
Okay, what color
are my eyes?

276
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:36,415
Well, at first glance,
your eyes are brown.

277
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:39,298
But when the light hits them
they change to amber.

278
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:42,893
And if you look really closely around the iris
the color is pure honey.

279
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:47,975
But when you look
into the sun

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,293
they almost look green.

281
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:51,670
That's my favorite.

282
00:13:58,661 --> 00:13:59,899
How'd I do?

283
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,997
I would've settled
for brown.

284
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:04,752
Okay!

285
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:06,227
Peanut, let go!

286
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:07,378
Off! Off!

287
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,082
I'm sorry he bit you.

288
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,694
I mean, they all have their shots
so it should be fine.

289
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,076
Seriously, don't worry about it.
(It) barely broke the skin.

290
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:16,322
Outside.

291
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,021
Did you just move
in or something?

292
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,834
No, I've been here
a year and a half.

293
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,661
Oh, nice place.

294
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:25,102
I should have some hydrogen peroxide
around here somewhere.

295
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,765
What is all this stuff?

296
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,643
Oh, I'm a yoga instructor.

297
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:29,549
This?

298
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,533
And a Little League coach.

299
00:14:31,558 --> 00:14:33,055
And a dog walker
and a caterer.

300
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,753
I told you I'm a temp.

301
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:37,932
That is not true.
She is an incredibly talented artist.

302
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:38,400
Remy.

303
00:14:38,425 --> 00:14:39,399
I mean, look at her sketchbook.

304
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:39,870
Remy!

305
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:40,883
She hides it
right under there.

306
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:41,725
Remy!

307
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,475
What?

308
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:45,520
The hell's he doing here?

309
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,065
He's not gay.

310
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:47,789
Not gay?

311
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:48,650
No!

312
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:53,785
Are you all right?

313
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,147
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

314
00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:58,669
Found it!

315
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,007
So you're an artist, too?

316
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:04,537
Uh, I like to dabble in
a lot of different things.

317
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:07,724
I mean, life's too short
to live the same day twice, right?

318
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:09,657
That's a good
philosophy to live by.

319
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,600
Yeah. My dad always used
to say that. Come on.

320
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,750
Used to?

321
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:15,996
Oh, yeah, my parents died
when I was little.

322
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:17,155
 Oh, I'm sorry.

323
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,614
That's okay.
(It) was a really long time ago.

324
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,254
Ready?

325
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,916
Yeah, I mean, it's a little embarrassing.

326
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:24,766
And I'm the doctor.
I'm the one who's supposed to look at the...

327
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,016
Ouh! Ow!

328
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,400
Oh my God. I'm sorry!

329
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:28,322
I'm just kidding.

330
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:29,825
I just...
I never get to do that.

331
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:34,122
Okay, because the cut is,
like, three inches higher.

332
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:35,700
Sorry.

333
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:38,126
Do you need my phone?

334
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:38,959
Oh, no thanks.

335
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:41,203
It's just my mom.

336
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:42,426
And it's only her
second page of the day.

337
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:43,785
She's just getting started.

338
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:46,332
Well, you're all set.

339
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:47,042
Thank you.

340
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:51,516
So, do you think...

341
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,315
we could do this again sometime,
maybe without the biting?

342
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:57,246
Yeah, that would be nice.

343
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:02,416
You heard from Kevin yet?

344
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,777
Not yet. I've paged him.

345
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,226
Would you page
him again?

346
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:06,492
- Good morning, Stan.
- Good morning.

347
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:07,695
You're in a good mood.

348
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,636
Hey, the last time the network executives
came to my dressing room

349
00:16:10,661 --> 00:16:12,282
I got my own show and a big fat raise.

350
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:13,494
Yeah and I had to start kissing your...

351
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,851
Viola Fields?

352
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:16,770
Oh my God!

353
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:19,568
It is such an honor
to meet you.

354
00:16:19,593 --> 00:16:21,106
Oh thank you, darling.

355
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,439
Would you mind
just signing this autograph?

356
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:26,165
For my grandmother.

357
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:29,899
I'd love to.

358
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,347
You know what else I'd love?
I'd love you to get me a latte.

359
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:34,563
Do you mind?

360
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:35,588
Okay.

361
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:36,581
Thanks, hon.

362
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,036
Hi, guys.
How are you?

363
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:44,774
That woman is a legend.

364
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:46,843
Shouldn't you be
getting the latte?

365
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:49,655
I just can't believe
they picked me to replace her.

366
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:56,573
Oh, shit!

367
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,315
I've been replaced?

368
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,574
I'm so sorry, Viola.

369
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:03,414
I'm fine.

370
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:08,375
I mean, you've had
an amazing career, Viola.

371
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:14,377
It's just that we're trying to appeal
to a younger demographic.

372
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,250
I'm fine.

373
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:17,103
I'm fine.

374
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,869
God damn!
Get my manager on the phone!

375
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,724
And then I'm gonna call
the head of the...

376
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:24,397
Um...

377
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:25,890
We're on in two minutes.

378
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:26,690
Okay.

379
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,664
Will you get her to come?

380
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:29,194
Please!

381
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:30,526
Okay, she'll be ready.

382
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:35,933
I'm ready.

I'm great.

Hey, I've had
a great run.

392
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,193
I've done exclusives with
Kissinger, the Dalai Lama,

Muhammad Ali,

four sitting presidents,

00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:00,983
three of them hit on me.

Five Emmys!

whose grandmother loves me.

00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:09,913
You know what
I'm gonna do?

400
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,305
I'm gonna finish out my contract

401
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,420
and I'm gonna leave this show
with my dignity intact.

402
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,384
Okay, coming back
from commercial.

403
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,351
Take 3, cue announcer.

404
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:20,355
Today on Public Intimacy,

405
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,382
pop singing sensation
Tanya Murphy.

406
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:26,968
And now we're live
with Viola Fields.

407
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:30,100
Four, three, two...

408
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,013
Well, that was very nice.

409
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,536
My goodness, you have a big voice
for such a tiny girl.

410
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:38,260
You're gonna miss
Viola Fields.

411
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,843
Have you always
been a singer?

412
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,401
Ever since I was a child,

413
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:44,013
I would sing
in school plays, choirs.

414
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:45,475
How old are you?

415
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,317
I'll be 17 next month.

416
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,874
What do you do for fun?

417
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,250
I love watching
really old movies.

418
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:56,072
They're my favorite.

419
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:58,017
Really? Really, which ones?

420
00:18:58,397 --> 00:19:00,982
Uh, well, "Grease"
and "Grease II."

421
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,840
Um, "Benji."
I love "Benji."

422
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,924
"Free Willy,"

423
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:08,680
"Legally blonde,"

424
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:10,989
"The Little Mermaid."

425
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:12,913
Yeah. Oh, I know.

426
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,757
You ever read a newspaper?

427
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:21,996
Newspaper?

428
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:24,546
Viola, the girl
has stars on her nipples.

429
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:27,320
I don't have
much time for that.

430
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:31,797
So basically, you have absolutely
no idea what's going on in the world?

431
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,447
Oh, l...
- And yet, you've sold over

432
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:37,652
five million albums, CDs,

433
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,038
to millions of kids who listen to your insipid lyrics.
- What is she doing?

434
00:19:41,063 --> 00:19:43,390
"You wanna know me,
look in my makeup bag."

435
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,418
You're influencing
an entire generation of kids

436
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:49,460
who won't know how
to think straight,

437
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,494
or vote for a president,

438
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,442
or remember the significance
of Roe versus Wade.

439
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:55,845
Oh!

440
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,898
 I don't support
boxing as a sport.

441
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,626
I think it's too violent.

442
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:02,560
You all better get that
little girl out of there.

443
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:07,922
Holy crap!

444
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:09,339
Get us off the air!
Quick!

445
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:11,914
Go to commercial! Go to commercial!

446
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:12,954
Crazy bitch!

447
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:13,814
Get off of me!

448
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,791
Cut! Cut!
- Get her off!

449
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,036
Put in the BowFlex tape!

450
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:17,492
Juiceman, something!

451
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:23,512
Oh, I don't support
boxing as a sport.

452
00:20:23,537 --> 00:20:25,161
I think it's too violent.

453
00:20:31,743 --> 00:20:32,760
Oh.

454
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:37,390
I wanted you to take one last look
at the old Viola.

455
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:40,558
Oh, thank God
I've changed.

456
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:42,464
Yes.

457
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,738
Well, just remember,

458
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:46,483
the breakdown was
only a few months ago.

459
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:47,759
So...

460
00:20:47,784 --> 00:20:49,850
take it nice
and slow out there.

461
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,032
No stress.

462
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:53,295
Absolutely.

463
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:56,481
In fact, I'm gonna take a vacation.

464
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:58,882
I've been promising my son
we'd go to Africa

465
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,548
since he was a little boy.

466
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:03,112
And I finally have
the time.

467
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:04,759
That's wonderful.

468
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,315
Not to worry,

469
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,844
I'm in complete control.

470
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:11,258
Ruby!

471
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,445
Ruby, my dear old friend.

472
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,925
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.

473
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,832
You look good.
They still have you medicated.

474
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:21,389
Ruby, I figured it out.

475
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,243
Life, I mean.

476
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:23,983
Oh, this ought to be good.

477
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:27,606
It's not about how many celebrities
I interviewed or what my ratings are.

478
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:30,674
It's about relationships
and family.

479
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:31,387
Oh!

480
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:33,221
Me and my son.

481
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,311
Oh, I just spoke to Kevin.

482
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:36,882
Did you get the tickets?

483
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,855
Sure did. Right here.

484
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,798
He's gonna be so surprised.

485
00:21:40,823 --> 00:21:43,168
Yeah, the three of you
shall have a good time.

486
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,379
Three?

487
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,006
Yeah.

488
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,797
You, Kevin and
his new girlfriend.

489
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:50,169
New girlfriend?

490
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:52,976
Oh, that's a lovely surprise.

491
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,012
Is it?

492
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:56,686
Well, I mean,
it can't be too serious.

493
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,898
I've only been away
a few months.

494
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:15,649
Well, that's
the end of it.

495
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,270
Where do you want me
to put this?

496
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,263
Oh, under the bed.

497
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:22,358
Uh, you sure you don't want me
to put it by the door

498
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:26,064
so you can make a quick escape to the apartment you still have for some reason?

499
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:28,937
No. Come on, you agreed to me
subletting my apartment.

500
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:31,988
I would have agreed to anything
to get you to move in here.

501
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:35,358
Oh, these are great.
Are they new?

502
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:37,383
Oh, no!
You can't look at those!

503
00:22:37,408 --> 00:22:38,357
'Cause they're
not finished yet.

504
00:22:38,382 --> 00:22:39,249
Oh, sorry.

505
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,080
Okay?
- Okay.

506
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:40,623
Please?

507
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:41,832
Here, I'll put them back.

508
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:43,506
Oh, I forgot to tell you,

509
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:45,928
we're having lunch with
my mom tomorrow.

510
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:47,620
Oh!

511
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:50,406
It'll be fine.
I promise.

512
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:58,027
You wanna take a shower?

513
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:00,367
Hmm.

514
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,098

00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:15,716
Well, he died
when I was two.

520
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:17,538
But that was just
her first husband.

521
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,401
At the time she was
a freelance journalist

522
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,845
and then she married this guy
who was a network exec

523
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,054
and got her her first
on-air break,

524
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,157
but divorced him
for Alec Wrigley.

525
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:28,326
Wait, the actor?

526
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:29,293
I thought he was...

527
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:31,055
Oh, he was.
It lasted about two years

528
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,938
till she threw him out for sleeping
with her second husband.

529
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,786
Wait, how many times
has she been married?

530
00:23:36,811 --> 00:23:37,616
About four.

531
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:38,184
Wow.

532
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,762
But, you know, her career
was always the main thing.

533
00:23:39,787 --> 00:23:41,382
She just lived for it.

534
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:43,673
Well, her career
and me, of course.

535
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:46,229
And, basically,
now I'm all she's got.

00:23:51,436 --> 00:23:52,787
Here we are.

537
00:23:52,812 --> 00:23:54,039
Oh, no.

538
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:04,520
Oh, playing dress-up,
are we?

539
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:10,841
Shut up! Is that
the Dalai Lama?

540
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,726
Yeah.

541
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:15,195
Oh my God, That can't be real.

542
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,134
It is.

543
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:20,268
Did you know
all these people?

544
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:20,937
Some of them.

545
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:21,966
Kevin!

546
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:24,657
Look at you, all handsome.

547
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:25,510
Ruby!

548
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:27,216
Good to see you.

549
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:28,735
You too.

550
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,998
Now, forget about
my mother.

551
00:24:30,023 --> 00:24:31,980
This is the woman
you need to get through.

552
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:33,328
Charlie, this is Ruby.

553
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,925
Well, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

554
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,775
Oh, the pleasure's mine.

555
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,700
Uh, excuse us.
I've got to talk to him about a rash.

556
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:47,812
You're bringing a girl home
to meet your mother now?

557
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,007
Yeah, Ruby, I am.

558
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,830
The women is fresh off
the funny farm.

559
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:55,354
Hey, why don't you come back,
let's say, next spring?

560
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:56,918
Oh, the trees
will be blooming.

561
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:57,498
Oh.

562
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:59,084
It'll be so beautiful.
She'll love it.

563
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:00,246
How is she?

564
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,222
She's good.

565
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:05,978
The first thing she did when she got home
was make me lock up all the booze.

566
00:25:06,003 --> 00:25:07,381
It's Oprah!

567
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:09,990
Oprah!

568
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:11,711
Yeah, Oprah.

569
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:14,646
There's one in there
with the cast from "Good Times" too.

570
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:17,338
So how big is this place?

571
00:25:17,363 --> 00:25:18,405
About four acres.

572
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,486
There's a tennis court, two swimming pools,
indoor and outdoor.

573
00:25:21,511 --> 00:25:22,814
It's kind of crazy.

574
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,077
What?
No helicopter pad?

575
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:27,007
Oh, no.
There's one out back.

576
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,153
I'm kidding.

577
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:29,406
Kevin!

578
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,035
Oh, I've missed you
so much!

579
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,908
I promise I'll never
leave you again.

580
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:39,347
Oh my God, Mom.
Look at you. You look fantastic.

581
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,283
Oh, just something
I threw together.

582
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:43,012
Come here.

583
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:44,080
What?

584
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:44,921
Introduce you to someone.

585
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:46,636
- Charlie. Mom?
- Kevin.

586
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:48,940
Charlie, this is Mom.

587
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,183
Mom, Charlie.

588
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:53,633
Oh, hi.

589
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,015
Oh, I'd love to just be able
to think of it and make it.

590
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,287
I must have spent the last 30 years
looking for the perfect little black...

591
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,708
cocktail dress.

592
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:04,618
Yes.

593
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:05,475
I know.

594
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,773
Well, it doesn't matter. You could
wear anything with your figure.

595
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:10,370
I mean, you look amazing.

596
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:11,705
Oh, honey, thanks.

597
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,275
Listen, when you're my age,
if ain't broke, you fix it before it is.

598
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,932
Why the question mark?

599
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:37,585
Oh, 'cause
I just don't know.

600
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:40,339
Oh.

601
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:41,439
I love your jewelry.

602
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:42,533
Oh, yes.
- I love that.

603
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:44,040
Yes, thank you.

604
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:45,284
I like it, the earth tones.

605
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:46,035
It's fantastic.

606
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,374
Where did you get this from?

607
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,267
My first husband.

608
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:50,968
That's Kevin's father. He gave it to me
when we were in Peru.

609
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:53,003
It's very earthy.
- It's like the dress,

610
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,007
Yeah, very earthy.

611
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:04,265
I just think it's wonderful
that you've tried so many temp jobs.

612
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,656
Think of all
the experiences you have.

613
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,335
You've been so quiet, Kevin.

614
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,231
Oh, it's kind of hard to
get a word in edgewise with you two.

615
00:27:14,722 --> 00:27:17,057
Oh, is he great,
or what?

616
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:19,175
I tell you too,
it's a little scary.

617
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,791
Enjoy it while you can.

618
00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:23,289
Here you go,
some more coffee.

619
00:27:23,314 --> 00:27:25,695
Actually, I was a little nervous
about the two of you meeting.

620
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,014
- Really?
- Why?

621
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,785
Well, 'cause it's
important to me.

622
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,306
Mom, you're the most
amazing woman I've ever known.

623
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:35,873
And, Charlie,
I've never met anyone like you.

624
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:38,069
You're real,
you're honest.

625
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:39,803
And although we've only
known each other for a few months,

626
00:27:39,828 --> 00:27:42,666
I feel like
I've known you forever.

627
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,898
I guess what I'm
trying to say here...

628
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,744
is what are you doing
for the rest of your life?

629
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:54,937
What?

630
00:28:01,154 --> 00:28:02,452
Oh my God!

631
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:05,725
Charlie, will you
marry me?

632
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:09,071
It's...

633
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:10,245
it's too sudden.

634
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,282
She's in shock.

635
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:11,820
No!

636
00:28:11,845 --> 00:28:14,492
I mean, I am, but...

637
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:18,662
Seriously?

638
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:19,940
Seriously.

639
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,954
No, no. Say "no."

640
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:24,180
Yes. Yes!

641
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:26,355
Yeah!

642
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:28,153
Oh, gee... oh!

643
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:30,609
Oh!

644
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,731
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

645
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:38,989
- Congratulations!
- Oh my God. I can't believe this.

646
00:28:39,014 --> 00:28:40,403
I am so happy for you.

647
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:42,804
Congratulations!
I'm so pleased

648
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:46,294
that you're gonna be
my daughter-in-law.

649
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:49,527
Oh, congratulations.

650
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:50,568
I can't believe this.

651
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:52,328
I'm so happy for you.

652
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,127
Thank you!

653
00:28:54,152 --> 00:28:55,751
You're gonna
need a moment alone.

654
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:58,512
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

655
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,598
Oh!

656
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:00,592
Shit!

657
00:29:03,732 --> 00:29:04,702
Ugh!

658
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:13,294
What's...

659
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,277
Ah!

660
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:16,196
14% alcohol!

661
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,735
You are so crazy! Oh my God!

662
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,962
Oh, I almost forgot.

663
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:27,628
I've been carrying this around for two weeks
 waiting for the perfect moment.

664
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:30,015
I can't believe that this
turned out to be it.

665
00:29:33,912 --> 00:29:35,172
Kevin.

666
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:36,229
Try it on.

667
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:44,302
It is the perfect moment.

668
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,360
Maybe you should go
check on your mom.

669
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:52,320
Oh, she's fine. She's probably
calling all of our relatives.

670
00:29:53,235 --> 00:29:55,667
Oh, Holy Spirit...

671
00:29:55,692 --> 00:29:57,667
surround me with light.

672
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:02,146
Please rid me
of my negative karma

673
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:04,273
and my wickedness.

674
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,238
Please help me be
a better person.

675
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:13,118
I could just kill
that dog-walking slut!

676
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,692
Of course.

677
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:21,459
She's pregnant.

678
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:24,447
So, goodness.

679
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:27,315
That was a lot to
take in at teatime.

680
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,773
- Oh, you're telling me.
- I had no idea

681
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:31,910
that you guys were so serious.

682
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:34,359
Kevin, you never
mentioned anything.

683
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:36,232
- Mom.
- Here's what I wanna say.

684
00:30:36,257 --> 00:30:38,396
It's wonderful
being in love.

685
00:30:39,188 --> 00:30:42,819
But I don't think marriage is
the best solution to a thing like this.

686
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:48,456
Well, you know nowadays a girl has
so many alternatives to getting married.

687
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:51,265
I'm mean, there's adoption, abortion,
lesbianism...

688
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,154
Whoa, Mom!

689
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:53,009
Hmm?

690
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:54,507
What are you talking about?

691
00:30:54,962 --> 00:30:58,524
Well, I mean, it's so sudden I have to
assume there's a pressing reason.

692
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:00,462
Oh, oh, no.

693
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:01,959
Charlie's not pregnant.

694
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:06,957
Call me old-fashioned,

695
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:09,318
marriage is a sacred union

696
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:12,739
that should only be entered into
with the utmost care.

697
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:15,039
Weren't you married
four times?

698
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:18,180
Yes, dear.

699
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:21,950
Which would make me an expert,
don't you think?

700
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:23,335
Excuse me.

701
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:24,843
I'm sorry.

702
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:27,575
Oh, it's the hospital.

703
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,528
I'll be right back.

704
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,465
Okay.

705
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,304
You want me to go
with you?

706
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:33,387
No, stay right there.

707
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,457
You know, this is as sudden
for me as it is for you.

708
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:51,537
It's too sudden, right?

709
00:31:51,562 --> 00:31:52,503
You think?

710
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:54,608
Yeah.

711
00:31:55,357 --> 00:31:56,273
Really?

712
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:06,047
I mean, what's the rush?
It's not like the old days

713
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,007
when you have to get married
and have kids, and

714
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:09,699
have it all figured out
by the time you are 21.

715
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:10,628
Exactly.

716
00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:11,743
We would have options now.

717
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:12,246
Yeah.

718
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:13,764
And I've always liked
having my options, you know?

719
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:15,248
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

720
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:18,715
This is so... big.

721
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,275
What am l...
what am I doing?

722
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:29,956
I love Kevin.

723
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,699
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with him.

724
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:37,120
Oh my God!
I'm getting married!

725
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,656
Ruby!

726
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:44,730
Ruby, I need a bottle of champagne.

727
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,094
We're gonna celebrate.

728
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:48,612
May I have the key
to the liquor cabinet please?

729
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:49,637
What key?

730
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:53,322
The key, Ruby.

731
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,872
Key?
There's no key.

732
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:58,885
Ruby, give me the key.

733
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,353
You want to take this
outside?

734
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:05,987
Bring me the key!

735
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:13,599
And fix your hair.

736
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,661
You look like
a damned cockatoo.

737
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:22,839
She is such
a fabulous assistant.

738
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,083
Hey, do you think
your mother liked me?

739
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:34,408
Of course. Why?

740
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:37,789
I don't know, because she called me
a pregnant lesbian?

741
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:41,853
I'm sure she meant that
as a compliment.

742
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,288
Trust me.
She loved you.

743
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,400
Oh, they're gone?

744
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:49,562
Ok. Well, I'll just put this baby
back to bed, okay?

745
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:53,670
My son,
the brilliant surgeon

746
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:57,550
is gonna marry a temp.

747
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:09,109
Gonna need something
stronger than this.

748
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,590
Where's that martini?

749
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,322
Hooch will not solve
your problems.

750
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:18,474
She's gonna destroy him.

751
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,312
It is so clear.

752
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:23,030
She's got no money,
no career goals.

753
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,865
She's just waiting for a rich innocent
to step right in her path.

754
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,314
Oh, Kevin's smarter than that.

755
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:32,232
Come on,
you raised him well.

756
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:33,473
He's a good boy.

757
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:36,525
But he's a man.
That's the problem.

758
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,704
The only time they think straight
is when they have an erection,

759
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:42,381
and it's usually pointed
right at the trampiest woman.

760
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,793
You talking about
her or you?

761
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:49,066
Look, there's nothing
you can do.

762
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:50,372
Just let it go.

763
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:51,915
You know what you need?

764
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,091
A project.

765
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:54,596
Or another husband.

766
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:56,912
You know, why don't you
marry another gay guy?

767
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:57,910
That was fun.

768
00:34:59,366 --> 00:35:00,411
You know, you're right.

769
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:01,824
I do need a project.

770
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:05,451
And I have
the perfect one.

771
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:07,573
I am gonna save my son.

772
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:09,663
Here.

773
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:10,175
What?

774
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,880
You go use those old
contacts of yours

775
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:14,966
to get all the information you can
about that little pimp.

776
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:17,514
And exactly what do you
expect to find?

777
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:20,716
Everybody's got a past, honey.

778
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:22,409
Find something.

779
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:25,298
And I'm gonna open up
the Montecito house

780
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,760
and get a party planner.

781
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:29,868
I'm gonna give them
an engagement party.

782
00:35:29,893 --> 00:35:31,631
And then what?
Lock her in the basement?

783
00:35:31,656 --> 00:35:34,369
When he sees how out of place
she is in his world,

784
00:35:34,394 --> 00:35:35,855
it's gonna be over.

785
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,100
This will end badly.

786
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:41,316
Get me another one
of those.

787
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:44,359
♪Ooh-ohh

788
00:35:44,384 --> 00:35:47,586

Is it me, or is each house
you take me to bigger than the last?

794
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:08,800
Well, I thought your mom
said this was a barbecue.

795
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:12,486
Oh my God. Looks like she's invited
everyone I've ever known.

796
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:16,806
And they're all
in black tie.

797
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:18,956
Oh, there's my mom.
Mom!

798
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:19,869
Darlings!

799
00:36:20,236 --> 00:36:21,412
How was the trip?

800
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:24,250
- I'm sorry.
- Welcome.

801
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:26,247
I didn't know this was a formal party.

802
00:36:26,272 --> 00:36:28,926
Well, that's because I have something for you.
I bought you a new dress.

803
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:30,703
Oh, see?
There's a dress upstairs.

804
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,363
- Thank you.
- Besides, you look great in anything.

805
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:36,001
Exactly. You always look
so clean and shiny.

806
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:40,131
Oh, Kevin, your tuxedo's upstairs
in your room.

807
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,246
But first I want you to meet
some friends. Come.

808
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:42,607
Ok.

809
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:43,944
- Prince Amir.
- Can I change first?

810
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:48,423
This is Sarah.

811
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:49,480
You know Kevin?

812
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,584
And this is Charlie.

813
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,824
She's a temp.

814
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:57,349
Oh, Charlie, this is the man that introduced the
euro to the global market.

815
00:36:57,374 --> 00:36:58,788
- Mr. Prime Minister.
- Viola.

816
00:36:58,813 --> 00:37:00,125
Oh, Marie.

817
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,335
You know my son, but
this is Charlie.

818
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,599
Very good to meet you.

819
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:05,052
It's so nice to meet you.

820
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:06,173
She's a temp.

821
00:37:07,034 --> 00:37:07,781
Yeah.

822
00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:10,078
I worked in a bank once.

823
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,744
Oh, look! There's
the Poet Laureate and...

824
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:15,540
Oh, Charlie, first I want you to meet
the Secretary of Commerce.

825
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:17,147
Viola, please let me
change first.

826
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:19,123
I don't wanna meet her
in my flip-flops.

827
00:37:19,687 --> 00:37:23,112
Of course, of course. Ruby, would
you show Charlie to the guest room?

828
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:24,968
- Come on, Charlie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

829
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:32,833
Wow!

830
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,566
Oh my...

831
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,824
It's vintage.

832
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:41,510
Oh, Fiona.

833
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:42,893
You look stunning.

834
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:44,235
Thank you. So do you.

835
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,649
My goodness.

836
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,139
Kevin just went up
to his old room.

837
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:50,478
Why don't you go
say hello to him?

838
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:51,523
I'd love to.

839
00:37:52,297 --> 00:37:53,167
Good girl.

840
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:10,107
Fiona, what are you doing here?
I'm dressing.

841
00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:13,128
Why don't you let me give you
a hand with that?

842
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:14,261
Give it up, Fiona.

843
00:38:16,613 --> 00:38:17,483
You know,

844
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:20,881
you and I had a very
strong bond once.

845
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:24,358
No, you and I had
very strong drinks once.

846
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:25,391
That's not true.

847
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,178
Kiss me. I'll remind you
how good it was.

848
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:30,443
What are you doing?

849
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:32,225
I'm engaged.
I'm happy.

850
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:34,463
It's gonna fit!

851
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,574
Why'd she get me
such a small dress?

852
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,528
I've two asses.

853
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:46,026
It'll fit.

854
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:47,089
There we go.

855
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:48,567
Okay.

856
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:49,936
Okay!

857
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,123
Okay!

858
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:57,393
What is it about her
that's so special?

859
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,284
I don't know, but I plan on spending
the rest of my life finding out.

860
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,642
Kevin!

861
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:09,153
God! Men in love
are really hot.

862
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,610
Fiona!

863
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:13,964
Oops!

864
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:14,832
Um...

865
00:39:14,857 --> 00:39:17,764
I was just giving Kevin
a congratulatory kiss.

866
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:20,149
Don't, uh, worry.

867
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,184
Why would I worry?
He's gay, right?

868
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:29,063
Charlie!

869
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:38,935
Charlie, that was not
what it looked like.

870
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,568
I'm going home.

871
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,594
I destroyed priceless couture,

872
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:48,373
embarrassed myself
in front of 70% of the world's royalty.

873
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:51,085
Oh! I forgot, yeah!

874
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:54,625
I just caught you making out
with your ex-girlfriend.

875
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,168
Charlie, let me explain.

876
00:39:57,193 --> 00:39:58,775
Ugh!
It doesn't matter.

877
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:03,604
I can't do this.

878
00:40:08,587 --> 00:40:10,196
I don't belong here,
Kevin.

879
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:14,185
And if I don't belong here
then maybe we don't...

880
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,652
Hey hey hey.
Listen to me.

881
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:17,990
It's you and me now.

882
00:40:19,772 --> 00:40:21,505
This isn't my world anymore.

883
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,292
You're my world.

884
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:31,827
Okay?

885
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:35,366
Let's get the hell out of here.
I'm taking you home.

886
00:40:36,344 --> 00:40:37,237
Okay.

887
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:38,836
Um...

888
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:42,036
Let me try and get out
of this dress and then...

889
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:44,540
Okay, see you

Yeah, it's great.

00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,046
I'm so glad you
finally decided to do it.

897
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:34,745
I don't know. I just woke up today
and it just felt like home.

898
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,921
I'm gonna do
all three walls.

899
00:41:37,684 --> 00:41:39,525
You know, I think it's time
to take a break.

900
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,688
Oh, wait!

901
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,082
- Wait a minute.
- Whoo whoo whoo!

902
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:45,260
I can't let it dry
too much.

903
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,223
Oh God!

904
00:41:49,871 --> 00:41:52,143
Are we getting out of bed
today, "Camille"?

905
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,306
What for?

906
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,185
I could die
and nobody would care.

907
00:41:57,537 --> 00:41:58,468
I would.

908
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,646
You promised me
a face-lift.

909
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:05,037
Sit down, Ruby.
Sit with me, hold my hand.

910
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,277
Have you got anything
on the girl yet?

911
00:42:10,302 --> 00:42:11,781
Nothing. Nada.

912
00:42:11,806 --> 00:42:13,140
No criminal record.

913
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:14,148
No debt.

914
00:42:14,173 --> 00:42:14,929
Good grades.

915
00:42:14,954 --> 00:42:17,243
Went to design school.
Then a string of odd jobs.

916
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,695
Isn't that exactly what
somebody with a past does?

917
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,577
What about drugs?
What about promiscuity?

918
00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:24,986
She's had fewer lovers
in her entire life

919
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:27,477
than you did
at closing day of Woodstock.

920
00:42:28,985 --> 00:42:30,201
Well, find something.

921
00:42:30,904 --> 00:42:35,223
Well, I guess if I had a hair sample, maybe I
could take it to my little crime lab and...

922
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:36,136
Perfect.

923
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:38,948
I'll get to work on it.

924
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:40,643
Listen to me.

925
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:41,959
There is nothing.

926
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:44,963
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe she's a good girl?

927
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:46,591
Oh, don't joke.

928
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:51,716
I would like to speak to that woman
who got back from the loony bin.

929
00:42:52,013 --> 00:42:53,238
Is she around?

930
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,462
Because you are taking me
for a spin in the crazy mobile.

931
00:42:58,897 --> 00:42:59,916
Ruby, Ruby.

932
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,691
Everybody knows when
a woman marries a man

933
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:04,546
she marries his mother
too, right?

934
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:07,632
What if I drive her crazy?

935
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,286
Okay, now you're
foaming at the mouth.

936
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:19,753
Charlie and Kevin's house.

937
00:43:20,238 --> 00:43:22,475
Oh, I forgot you live there.

938
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:27,201
I didn't realize that you
had already moved in.

939
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:30,192
Kevin, stop it. I'm on the phone
with your mother!

940
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:31,132
I'm sorry, Viola.

941
00:43:31,157 --> 00:43:33,155
The slut's practically
fornicating with him!

942
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:33,878
Stop it!

943
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:34,647
I don't blame her.

944
00:43:34,672 --> 00:43:36,286
That boy's a fine piece of ass.

945
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,576
Hold on, Viola.
He's...

946
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:40,392
Stop it! Right here.

947
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,008
Actually, Charlie,
the reason I'm calling

948
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:44,729
is I wondered if you'd like to
have lunch next week.

949
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:46,837
Really?

950
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:49,428
How would Tuesday
work for you?

951
00:43:49,453 --> 00:43:51,249
Yeah,
Tuesday's perfect!

952
00:43:52,019 --> 00:43:54,832
Listen, Viola, I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now,

953
00:43:54,857 --> 00:43:57,124
Um, but Tuesday's fine.

954
00:43:57,149 --> 00:43:58,253
Yeah, me too.

955
00:43:58,757 --> 00:44:00,011
Lots to do!

956
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:01,345
Okay, bye!

957
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:04,080
Oh.

958
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,203
I'll go get the vodka.

959
00:44:22,844 --> 00:44:24,321
It's good to see you.

960
00:44:24,945 --> 00:44:26,022
There she is.

961
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:32,197
Charlotte.

962
00:44:34,176 --> 00:44:36,610
Hi. I'm gonna have the garden salad

963
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:40,514
and the low-cal Chinese dressing
and a decaf iced tea.

964
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:41,505
And you, miss?

965
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,276
Oh, um, I'll just have a...

966
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:46,636
cheeseburger
with fries and a soda.

967
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:47,859
- All right.
- Okay.

968
00:44:48,971 --> 00:44:50,811
You continue
to surprise me.

969
00:44:52,006 --> 00:44:54,473
Arert you worried about fitting
in your wedding dress?

970
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:58,014
Well, I mean, I'm making the dress
to fit my body,

971
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,050
not the other way around.

972
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:02,031
Whoa. I wish I had been
that confident when I got married.

973
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:04,882
I'll tell you one thing
you're gonna have that I never did,

974
00:45:04,907 --> 00:45:06,889
a stupendous wedding.

975
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,444
And it's important that we
book the church right away.

976
00:45:11,538 --> 00:45:14,317
I always thought
that Kevin looked like Jesus

977
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:16,346
in the cathedral down on Second Street.

978
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:21,647
Actually, we were thinking
of having a

979
00:45:21,672 --> 00:45:23,524
non-denominational service,

980
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:26,163
being that I'm more spiritual
than religious.

981
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:27,293
Oh.

982
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:31,623
What about my place then?

983
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:34,079
That way we don't even
need to book a location.

984
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:35,965
And Kevin was born there
and grew up there.

985
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,111
Oh, it would mean
so much to him.

986
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:39,130
I'll plan it all.

987
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:42,767
We'll have that marvelous band
that the Swansons' had at their wedding,

988
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:43,951
and a divine cake.

989
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:44,862
Oh, honey!

990
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:46,159
No no no!

991
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,118
Chewing,
it's a disgusting habit.

992
00:45:50,637 --> 00:45:52,743
Oh, hold still.
I've gotta...

993
00:45:52,768 --> 00:45:53,467
- There!
- Ow!

994
00:45:53,492 --> 00:45:54,151
Got it!

995
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:57,289
Thanks, um...

996
00:45:57,915 --> 00:45:59,420
What do you think
about peach?

997
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,663
- Oh, um, excuse me.
- Yes?

998
00:46:03,688 --> 00:46:05,410
Can I get another salad
without the nuts?

999
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:06,957
I have allergies.

1000
00:46:06,982 --> 00:46:07,846
Okay.

1001
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,548
I'm allergic to nuts,
and eggs, and shellfish,

1002
00:46:10,573 --> 00:46:11,928
and blueberries.

1003
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:13,334
Oh, and soy.

1004
00:46:13,455 --> 00:46:16,242
It's amazing you've been able
to nourish yourself all these years.

1005
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:19,590
Oh, yeah!
The cake!

1006
00:46:19,615 --> 00:46:23,944
I'm thinking traditional vanilla
with strawberry drizzle.

1007
00:46:24,888 --> 00:46:28,615
Look, Viola, I really do have
all of this under control.

1008
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,698
I made this for you.

1009
00:46:29,723 --> 00:46:32,164
It's your wedding planner book.
Peach.

1010
00:46:36,204 --> 00:46:36,929
Oh.

1011
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,675
Is that a picture
of me and Kevin?

1012
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,972
Oh, and...

1013
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,089
present time from your new mama!

1014
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,806
Thanks.

1015
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:51,796
Wow!

1016
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:55,418
Big!

1017
00:46:55,443 --> 00:46:56,777
You can see the thorns on the roses.

1018
00:46:56,802 --> 00:46:59,014
You'll wear it on your wedding day,
just like I did.

1019
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:02,218
Of course I was
a virgin when I wed.

1020
00:47:02,984 --> 00:47:05,057
But we'll just pretend
with you.

1021
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:07,290
Now, about the wedding,

1022
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:10,012
the two of you are gonna arrive
in a horse and carriage.

1023
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:13,302
And the driver's top hat
will match the horse's saddles

1024
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:15,099
and the ribbons on the doves

1025
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:20,494
that will be released at the
exact moment of "I do."

1026
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:21,318
Hmm?

1027
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:24,789
And I've been in touch
with your bridesmaids.

1028
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:26,919
How do you know
their names?

1029
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,553
Well, Kevin told me.
And I think for the honeymoon

1030
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:31,994
St. Bart's is the absolute
best place for you to go

1031
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:32,961
'cause Kevin adores it.

1032
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,568
Hey, just... hold on!

1033
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:36,069
Just wait
a minute, okay?

1034
00:47:39,386 --> 00:47:40,444
No.

1035
00:47:41,308 --> 00:47:42,994
Thank you, but no.

1036
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:45,722
Thank you,
but no to everything.

1037
00:47:46,012 --> 00:47:48,565
No to the horse
and buggy.

1038
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:52,318
No to the top hats,
and to the doves and geese

1039
00:47:52,343 --> 00:47:54,985
and any other farm animals
you're thinking of using that day.

1040
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:57,671
And definitely no to you
planning our honeymoon.

1041
00:47:58,048 --> 00:47:59,396
- What?
- Oh no.

1042
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:00,480
I can... oh!

1043
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:01,660
Oh!

1044
00:48:01,864 --> 00:48:03,361
- What's wrong?
- Oh!

1045
00:48:03,386 --> 00:48:05,409
- "Oh no" what?
- My pills, my pills!

1046
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:06,806
Okay.
Well, let me help you.

1047
00:48:06,831 --> 00:48:07,774
Oh!

1048
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,024
Viola!

1049
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,851
- Oh, no!
- Wait, Viola!

1050
00:48:11,794 --> 00:48:12,687
Viola!

1051
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:14,042
Viola!

1052
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:17,931
Oh my God, Viola.
Oh my God!

1053
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:20,095
- Give her some room.
- Help!

1054
00:48:21,092 --> 00:48:22,619
My God, is she dead?

1055
00:48:22,644 --> 00:48:24,043
- No!
- Get her some help.

1056
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:26,648
It couldn't be
that easy.

1057
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:34,262
She's had an anxiety attack,

1058
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,177
which can feel like
a heart attack.

1059
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:37,829
She's gonna be okay.

1060
00:48:38,305 --> 00:48:41,174
But she definitely needs
to take it easy. No stress.

1061
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:45,556
Uh, she said that you were yelling at her,
refused her gift

1062
00:48:45,581 --> 00:48:47,848
and said she couldn't
plan our wedding.

1063
00:48:48,308 --> 00:48:49,650
Tell me that's
not true.

1064
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:54,501
Well, technically...

1065
00:48:54,526 --> 00:48:55,227
yes.

1066
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:57,412
But, hold on.
I didn't yell at her.

1067
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:00,214
And she just kept pushing
and pushing and pushing.

1068
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,392
And, okay, I admit it.
I snapped a little bit. But...

1069
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:06,360
I mean, what was I supposed to do?
She wouldn't take no for an answer.

1070
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:08,585
Oh, come on, look, you know
what a hard time she's been having.

1071
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:09,892
So she's a little difficult.

1072
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:10,930
Difficult?

1073
00:49:10,955 --> 00:49:12,232
A two-year-old
is difficult.

1074
00:49:12,257 --> 00:49:15,080
- She's like... ah!
- Come on, I mean, she's all alone.

1075
00:49:15,105 --> 00:49:16,859
I'm all she's got...
we're all she's got.

1076
00:49:17,683 --> 00:49:18,704
Come on.

1077
00:49:19,801 --> 00:49:20,737
Excuse me.

1078
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:23,214
I'm Dr. Chamberlain,
the psychiatrist in residence.

1079
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:24,062
You Mrs. Fields's son?

1080
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:24,774
Yes.

1081
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:25,832
May we speak in private?

1082
00:49:25,857 --> 00:49:27,816
Oh, actually, this is my fiancée.
We can talk.

1083
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:29,506
Um, is she okay?

1084
00:49:29,813 --> 00:49:32,617
Well, I just completed your mother's
interview and I'm concerned.

1085
00:49:33,107 --> 00:49:36,510
It's possible that she's on the verge
of a psychotic break.

1086
00:49:37,146 --> 00:49:40,575
I should probably see her
at least twice a week, minimum.

1087
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,177
Also, I prescribed her
some anti-anxiety medication.

1088
00:49:43,202 --> 00:49:46,031
If she starts to feel overwhelmed,
they'll relax her.

1089
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:47,488
Does she live alone?

1090
00:49:47,513 --> 00:49:48,559
Uh, yeah.

1091
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:51,142
Well, I feel it would be best

1092
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,262
if she were cared for
by relatives,

1093
00:49:53,287 --> 00:49:55,274
people that are closest
to her during this time.

1094
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:58,123
Just until we're confident
that she's out of danger.

1095
00:49:58,876 --> 00:49:59,626
All right.

1096
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:00,718
Well, thank you, Doctor.

1097
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:04,201
Ah, God.

1098
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:05,968
I've got that
medical conference.

1099
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:07,124
What am I gonna do?

1100
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:09,663
You know what?
Don't...

1101
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:10,661
Don't worry about it.

1102
00:50:10,686 --> 00:50:13,259
Um, I'll take care of her.

1103
00:50:16,553 --> 00:50:17,484
Thank you.

1104
00:50:18,034 --> 00:50:18,776
Come on.

1105
00:50:19,012 --> 00:50:19,633
What?

1106
00:50:19,657 --> 00:50:21,563
- You know, come with me.
- No no, the doctor said no stress.

1107
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:23,045
- All right? Charlie, come on.
- I'll stay here.

1108
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,004
- Enough already.
- Kevin.

1109
00:50:24,029 --> 00:50:25,020
Come on.

1110
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:29,517
Come on.

1111
00:50:34,129 --> 00:50:35,877
I am so sorry.

1112
00:50:36,114 --> 00:50:38,622
No, Mom, don't be.
It's okay, really.

1113
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:39,636
Charlie?

1114
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:43,664
I'm sorry too, Viola.

1115
00:50:44,038 --> 00:50:45,842
No, I was too pushy.

1116
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:49,507
No.

1117
00:50:49,532 --> 00:50:52,092
You weren't.
Look, Viola...

1118
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,980
I would love it if you would
help me with the wedding.

1119
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:58,635
It's all right, sweetheart,
l...

1120
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,514
I don't really think
I'm up to it.

1121
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:02,794
My nerves are shot.

1122
00:51:06,694 --> 00:51:07,728
Mom...

1123
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:12,513
Mom, Charlie and I think
you should live with us for a while,

1124
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:13,914
until you feel better.

1125
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,440
Are you sure?

1126
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:19,677
Oh!

1127
00:51:21,468 --> 00:51:23,636
- Oh, I can't possibly.
- Mom.

1128
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:25,445
- I couldn't.
- It's okay. Relax.

1129
00:51:27,764 --> 00:51:29,187
I couldn't possibly.

1130
00:51:31,397 --> 00:51:33,593
Not unless I know
Charlotte's forgiven me.

1131
00:51:35,102 --> 00:51:36,166
Will you?

1132
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:39,370
Me?

1133
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,099
Yeah, I forgive you.

1134
00:51:46,662 --> 00:51:47,075
Oh.

1135
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,642
Yeah, you just put those
anywhere.

1136
00:51:53,718 --> 00:51:54,973
- Hi!
- Hi.

1137
00:51:54,998 --> 00:51:57,174
- Are you feeling better?
- I'm much better, thank you.

1138
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:58,014
Great.

1139
00:51:58,639 --> 00:51:59,777
Sweetheart, I'm kind of thirsty.

1140
00:51:59,802 --> 00:52:01,225
Would you...
Is the kitchen over there?

1141
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:01,893
Yeah, sure.

1142
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:02,635
Great.

1143
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:04,009
Okay.

1144
00:52:06,461 --> 00:52:07,371
Hey, Charlie.

1145
00:52:07,396 --> 00:52:08,556
You moving in, too?

1146
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:10,155
No, I don't like
the neighborhood.

1147
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,579
Look, do you have any
firearms in the house?

1148
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,170
No.

1149
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,132
You might wanna get one.

1150
00:52:23,294 --> 00:52:24,609
When will you be back?

1151
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:26,799
Soon as I can, honey.
I promise.

1152
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:30,207
(Are you) sure you're gonna be okay?

1153
00:52:30,572 --> 00:52:33,837
Yeah. I mean, hey, it's
only at night, right?

1154
00:52:33,862 --> 00:52:34,748
And...

1155
00:52:34,773 --> 00:52:38,182
I mean, she's gonna sleep most of the time
with those pills the doctor gave her.

1156
00:52:38,207 --> 00:52:38,925
 Right?

1157
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,488
Look, I know my mom can be
a little challenging.

1158
00:52:41,513 --> 00:52:43,149
So if you have any
problems, just call me.

1159
00:52:43,174 --> 00:52:44,965
I'm on the first flight back,
I promise.

1160
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:45,788
Okay.

1161
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:47,924
Well, hurry home.

1162
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:50,515
And who knows?
By the time I get back,

1163
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,297
maybe you two will be best friends.

1164
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:55,181
Oh, am I interrupting
something?

1165
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:56,634
Uh, no, Mom, come in.

1166
00:52:56,659 --> 00:52:57,564
The caterer called.

1167
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:59,533
He still thinks
I'm doing the wedding.

1168
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:01,961
He sent over a sample plate
'cause I gave him the colors you wanted.

1169
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:04,310
I said absolutely no peach.

1170
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,806
And from now on, everything
goes through my new daughter.

1171
00:53:09,463 --> 00:53:10,326
Thank you.

1172
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:11,067
Yeah?

1173
00:53:11,092 --> 00:53:12,561
Okay, I'll be
right down, thanks.

1174
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:13,623
Oh, here. Look.

1175
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,925
Oh, it's beautiful, Viola.

1176
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:19,076
- Thank you.
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.

1177
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:20,843
My car's here. Gotta go.

1178
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:22,441
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.
- Okay.

1179
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:23,378
Oh, bye, sweetie.

1180
00:53:23,873 --> 00:53:25,123
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

1181
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:26,867
- We're gonna have such a good time.
- Okay.

1182
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:29,435
- I'll be a good roommate. I promise.
- Okay.

1183
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,387
It's so nice
to have a girlfriend.

1184
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,404
Yeah.

1185
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:05,712
Viola?

1186
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:07,425
Are you all right?

1187
00:54:07,772 --> 00:54:09,004
I can't sleep.

1188
00:54:12,095 --> 00:54:13,878
I feel so alone.

1189
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:15,887
I do.

1190
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,014
You're not alone.
I'm here.

1191
00:54:21,188 --> 00:54:22,956
Did you take
your pills?

1192
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:23,934
My pills?

1193
00:54:25,004 --> 00:54:26,055
Oh no, I forgot.

1194
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,659
Could you get them
for me, sweetie?

1195
00:54:28,684 --> 00:54:29,872
They're on the sink.

1196
00:54:31,987 --> 00:54:32,777
Sure.

1197
00:54:33,072 --> 00:54:33,873
Okay.

1198
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,516
Here they are.

1199
00:54:44,305 --> 00:54:45,077
Thank you.

1200
00:54:45,102 --> 00:54:46,359
You're welcome.

1201
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:49,249
Oh, I don't have any water.
Could you get me some water please?

1202
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:50,825
Okay.

1203
00:54:51,562 --> 00:54:53,691
Oh, I can't drink out
of the tap.

1204
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:58,210
Would you get me some Evian
with ice?

1205
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:00,740
Yeah.

1206
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:10,560
Here you go.

1207
00:55:10,585 --> 00:55:11,660
Oh, thank you.

1208
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:16,410
You have a good night,
okay?

1209
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:19,129
Charlotte?

1210
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:21,441
I hate to ask you this,

1211
00:55:21,466 --> 00:55:23,360
but it's my first night here.

1212
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:26,549
Could you stay with me?

1213
00:55:27,635 --> 00:55:28,577
Please?

1214
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:30,600
Sleep with me.
Be a good girl.

1215
00:55:34,554 --> 00:55:37,019
Huh? No no no!

1216
00:55:37,624 --> 00:55:38,437
Don't!

1217
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:41,300
God!

1218
00:55:41,518 --> 00:55:42,398
Viola!

1219
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:44,567
- Are you okay?
- No, let go of me, you!

1220
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:52,029
No.

1221
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:04,996
Oh!

1222
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,964
Okay. Okay.

1223
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:31,989
Hi, how was your day?

1224
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:33,987
It was... okay.

1225
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:35,589
Wonderful!

1226
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:36,933
You're cooking.

1227
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:39,423
I wanted to make you
dinner all by myself.

1228
00:56:40,851 --> 00:56:41,795
Sit.

1229
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:42,794
Okay.

1230
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:47,338
It's steak
and kidney pie.

1231
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:50,904
Actually, the steak didn't defrost
in time so it's mostly kidney.

1232
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:51,880
Mmm!

1233
00:56:52,987 --> 00:56:53,730
Do you like it?

1234
00:56:53,755 --> 00:56:54,594
Mm-hm!

1235
00:56:57,718 --> 00:56:59,108
I made a decision today.

1236
00:56:59,845 --> 00:57:02,573
I called my lawyer
and I asked him to redo my will.

1237
00:57:03,669 --> 00:57:05,375
I wanna include
my new daughter.

1238
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:11,413
Really, Viola,
that's not necessary.

1239
00:57:11,438 --> 00:57:12,816
Oh, don't be silly.
I want to.

1240
00:57:12,841 --> 00:57:15,996
Of course they have all these
stupid questions that they wanna ask.

1241
00:57:16,021 --> 00:57:18,888
You know, like, "Are you
currently an illegal alien?"

1242
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:21,173
Oh, uh...

1243
00:57:21,198 --> 00:57:21,831
No.

1244
00:57:23,156 --> 00:57:25,071
Oh, that's interesting.
Okay.

1245
00:57:25,456 --> 00:57:28,494
Um, are there any hereditary illnesses
in your family?

1246
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:31,578
You know, the kind that could be
passed on to grandchildren?

1247
00:57:31,603 --> 00:57:32,589
Uh, no.

1248
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:33,306
No.

1249
00:57:33,331 --> 00:57:36,067
How many men have you been
sexually active with?

1250
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:37,249
What?

1251
00:57:37,274 --> 00:57:38,640
Why would they wanna know that?

1252
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:40,306
That many, huh?

1253
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:44,507
Would you be willing to sign
a prenuptial agreement?

1254
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:48,211
Excuse me?

1255
00:57:48,236 --> 00:57:48,972
I know.

1256
00:57:48,997 --> 00:57:51,612
They're such nosy bastards.
It's none of their business.

1257
00:57:51,637 --> 00:57:52,689
Let's just deal with this later.

1258
00:57:52,714 --> 00:57:54,320
No, why don't we deal
with it right now?

1259
00:57:58,525 --> 00:57:59,496
I'll tell you what,

1260
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:02,373
I'll clean up the kitchen and you
continue enjoying your dinner.

1261
00:58:03,204 --> 00:58:04,474
No no no.

1262
00:58:05,632 --> 00:58:07,340
You did all the cooking.
I'll clean up.

1263
00:58:07,772 --> 00:58:08,541
Are you sure?

1264
00:58:08,566 --> 00:58:09,234
Yeah.

1265
00:58:09,259 --> 00:58:10,762
I am kind of tired.

1266
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:11,789
Thanks.

1267
00:58:12,196 --> 00:58:13,410
Well, I'll just
go up to bed then.

1268
00:58:13,435 --> 00:58:16,085
I had kind of a difficult
night last night.

1269
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,913
You had (a difficult night?)

1270
00:58:22,556 --> 00:58:23,907
He's skidding
out of control.

1271
00:58:23,932 --> 00:58:25,488
This bus is out of control.

1272
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:34,490
Somebody there?

1273
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:35,445
Tina.

1274
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,922
Tina.

1275
00:58:40,412 --> 00:58:41,680
Who the hell is that?

1276
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:02,086
Oh.

1277
00:59:02,553 --> 00:59:03,492
What?

1278
00:59:03,517 --> 00:59:04,751
Oh my God.

1279
00:59:04,776 --> 00:59:05,867
I thought you were sleeping.

1280
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:06,939
Well, I couldn't sleep.

1281
00:59:07,736 --> 00:59:09,747
Hmm? What do you think
of my outfit?

1282
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,012
This is a ceremonial robe
given to me by Chairman Mao.

1283
00:59:13,037 --> 00:59:14,499
These go with the robe.

1284
00:59:14,524 --> 00:59:17,563
This was a birthday gift
from the Dalai Lama,

1285
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:19,584
who never forgot my birthday.

1286
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:22,287
Of course now
he doesn't care anymore.

1287
00:59:22,784 --> 00:59:24,070
- Do you mind if I sit with you?
- No.

1288
00:59:24,095 --> 00:59:25,017
Just for a little while.

1289
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:25,696
Okay.

1290
00:59:29,342 --> 00:59:30,563
Why's she running?

1291
00:59:31,212 --> 00:59:33,130
Well, someone's
chasing her.

1292
00:59:34,587 --> 00:59:35,995
Why is he chasing her?

1293
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:37,784
I'm not sure.

1294
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:38,691
Well, who is he?

1295
00:59:38,716 --> 00:59:39,793
Well...

1296
00:59:39,818 --> 00:59:41,644
I don't know.
We have to watch.

1297
00:59:41,669 --> 00:59:42,919
You have to stop talking.

1298
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:43,702
Mm.

1299
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:45,493
Don't you hate
what she's wearing?

1300
00:59:45,518 --> 00:59:46,390
I mean,

1301
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:48,222
running out there with bare feet,
and

1302
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:51,051
what is that, a pajama top?
It's so unrealistic.

1303
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,648
I once did a whole segment
on nighttime television.

1304
00:59:54,673 --> 00:59:56,666
You would not believe

1305
00:59:56,691 --> 00:59:59,578
how much the demographics
influence the networks.

1306
00:59:59,603 --> 01:00:01,691
I mean it's just ridiculous.
All they care about is the bottom line.

1307
01:00:01,716 --> 01:00:05,036
Oh, it's so nice just to sit
with family and do nothing, huh?

1308
01:00:05,356 --> 01:00:07,336
Don't even need to talk.
It's wonderful.

1309
01:00:08,399 --> 01:00:10,318
I miss so much
being a working mom.

1310
01:00:10,343 --> 01:00:12,056
I used to bring Kevin,
though, to the set.

1311
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:14,098
That's where he met
Gore Vidal and Jackie Chan.

1312
01:00:14,123 --> 01:00:15,504
Is there anybody famous
in this movie?

1313
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,234
Because I don't know
any of them.

1314
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:18,287
And they all look the same.

1315
01:00:18,312 --> 01:00:20,272
All the girls have the same body,
all the boys have the same hair.

1316
01:00:20,297 --> 01:00:22,986
I wonder why there're so many beautiful people
who live in Los Angeles?

1317
01:00:23,011 --> 01:00:26,856
I think all the beautiful genes
ended up in California.

1318
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:28,559
Why is he kissing her?

1319
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:29,596
It's beyond me.

1320
01:00:48,009 --> 01:00:51,174
I'm sorry. I thought
it was air freshener.

1321
01:01:01,316 --> 01:01:02,000
Charlie?

1322
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,311
Dr. Batel's office.

1323
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:06,456
Miss Reynolds?

1324
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:08,466
Hi.

1325
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,628
Yeah.

1326
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:11,185
Nope.

1327
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:12,466
Okay.

1328
01:01:12,692 --> 01:01:13,534
Bye.

1329
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,582
Oh, God. I...

1330
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:22,952
I'm sorry. You know what?
That's probably my fault.

1331
01:01:22,977 --> 01:01:23,928
I...

1332
01:01:23,953 --> 01:01:25,694
I mean,
I never thought she'd...

1333
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:27,893
I mean, she's a little
eccentric, you know?

1334
01:01:28,422 --> 01:01:29,751
I'm sorry.

1335
01:01:29,776 --> 01:01:30,562
Well, It doesn't matter.

1336
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:33,917
I don't want to talk about your mom
tonight. I want to talk about us.

1337
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:35,457
I miss you.

1338
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,324
I miss you too.

1339
01:01:38,582 --> 01:01:41,542
Especially now
when I'm in the tub...

1340
01:01:42,538 --> 01:01:44,636
naked and wet...

1341
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:46,303
and naked.

1342
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,549
Really?

1343
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,391
Well, do you know what I'd do
to you if I was there?

1344
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,011
What?

1345
01:01:52,036 --> 01:01:53,019
Well, for starters...

1346
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:53,749
Charlie!

1347
01:01:54,899 --> 01:01:57,183
- I'm not looking. I'm not looking.
- Hello?

1348
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,951
- I wanted to return your shampoo.
- Your mom just walked in.

1349
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:01,965
You know, you really should use a shampoo
that doesn't dry your hair so much.

1350
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,566
We don't want a bride
with straw under her veil.

1351
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:06,069
- Oh, is that Kevin?
- Yeah, it is.

1352
01:02:06,094 --> 01:02:07,623
Oh, honey, your mom
wants to talk to you.

1353
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:08,830
Sweetie, hi.

1354
01:02:09,254 --> 01:02:09,880
Hi, Mom.

1355
01:02:09,905 --> 01:02:12,372
Oh, honey, I can't thank
you both enough.

1356
01:02:12,755 --> 01:02:13,400
Of course.

1357
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:15,764
I'm having the
most wonderful time.

1358
01:02:16,355 --> 01:02:17,222
How's Charlie?

1359
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:18,776
Oh, she's been a doll.

1360
01:02:19,222 --> 01:02:20,997
We've been girlfriends
all week.

1361
01:02:21,522 --> 01:02:22,453
Great.

1362
01:02:22,478 --> 01:02:24,025
I'm gonna be sad to go home.

1363
01:02:25,017 --> 01:02:25,807
You do?

1364
01:02:25,832 --> 01:02:28,347
Well, you never know what the future's
gonna bring, right?

1365
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:30,309
I mean, I do love
this neighborhood.

1366
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:32,246
In fact, you know,
two doors down,

1367
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:33,806
there's this house for sale.

1368
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:35,773
It's got two big bay windows

1369
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:37,555
and a great rose garden.

1370
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,277
You know how
I love rose gardens.

1371
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:42,049
And you know, basically,
it's got my name all over it.

1372
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:43,885
I'm having my...

1373
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,685
real estate guy
look into it.

1374
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,034
She's buying a house here?

1375
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:49,609
Two doors away.

1376
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:53,221
"Lovely property.
Beautiful bay windows."

1377
01:02:53,246 --> 01:02:54,672
It's bullshit!

1378
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,220
She doesn't even like
this neighborhood.

1379
01:02:57,755 --> 01:02:59,524
Oh God, I'm so exhausted.

1380
01:02:59,549 --> 01:03:01,319
She's driving me insane!

1381
01:03:02,385 --> 01:03:03,760
I can't do this.

1382
01:03:03,785 --> 01:03:05,159
Yes, you can!

1383
01:03:05,184 --> 01:03:08,202
Stop being
such a big baby.

1384
01:03:08,227 --> 01:03:10,304
Kevin is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1385
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:13,233
Charlie, do not
give up on this one.

1386
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:17,904
(It) seems Mommy Dearest has been keeping
a very close eye on you, sweetie.

1387
01:03:18,611 --> 01:03:21,007
What are you talking about?
What are you doing in her clothes?

1388
01:03:21,508 --> 01:03:24,684
I was just upstairs in her room
minding my own business.

1389
01:03:24,709 --> 01:03:27,318
And I found all of this
in her closet.

1390
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:29,797
She's been investigating you.

1391
01:03:30,502 --> 01:03:31,450
Whoa.

1392
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,739
Why does she have
your high school transcripts?

1393
01:03:33,764 --> 01:03:34,557
I know.

1394
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:39,499
There's a picture of me
at the beach?!

1395
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,707
- Oh my God, I can not believe that.
- Yes, it is.

1396
01:03:41,732 --> 01:03:43,260
There's another picture
of you in here.

1397
01:03:43,285 --> 01:03:44,202
And it's...

1398
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:46,338
Look, look at that.
It's like a closeup.

1399
01:03:46,363 --> 01:03:49,057
- But you have to be close to take that, right?
- Oh, my God!

1400
01:03:49,082 --> 01:03:50,924
Look at all this Gucci!

1401
01:03:50,949 --> 01:03:53,631
It's just
Gucci Gucci Gucci!

1402
01:03:53,656 --> 01:03:57,095
Oh, she has skin caviar.
This stuff sells for $400 a jar.

1403
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,435
I've heard of that.
I want a try.

1404
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,203
Here.

1405
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:00,799
- Mm.
- Doesn't that smell good?

1406
01:04:01,191 --> 01:04:02,906
Ooh, hello.

1407
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:05,085
What are these?

1408
01:04:05,646 --> 01:04:07,472
Those are
just her anti-anxiety pills.

1409
01:04:07,497 --> 01:04:09,523
Ooh, these are good.

1410
01:04:09,548 --> 01:04:10,016
Really?

1411
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:12,268
They'd knock out a horse.
I have these at home.

1412
01:04:12,293 --> 01:04:12,935
You do?

1413
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,708
Wait.

1414
01:04:15,228 --> 01:04:17,222
Well, I don't know what these are.
But they're definitely not what I take.

1415
01:04:17,247 --> 01:04:18,011
These...

1416
01:04:18,036 --> 01:04:19,549
They smell like oranges.

1417
01:04:19,574 --> 01:04:20,554
Are you sure?

1418
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:21,282
Yeah.

1419
01:04:21,477 --> 01:04:22,272
Let me see.

1420
01:04:26,919 --> 01:04:28,133
Hi, Andy.

1421
01:04:28,158 --> 01:04:29,043
It's Charlie.

1422
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,173
Yeah. No, I'm not working
for Dr. Batel's office this week.

1423
01:04:32,198 --> 01:04:33,765
But I had a question.

1424
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,379
Yeah, about some pills.

1425
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:36,417
Can I stop by?

1426
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:39,531
Charlie, I'm having
a bit of a bad day,

1427
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:42,285
so Ruby's gonna take me
to see Dr. Chamberlain.

1428
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,364
Okay!

1429
01:04:43,822 --> 01:04:45,060
You take care!

1430
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,341
Let's see
what you're up to.

1431
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:58,605
- There you go.
- Well, thank you. Thank you so much.

1432
01:04:59,117 --> 01:05:01,031
- And thank you.
- Wear that, sister.

1433
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:03,545
Okay, now Cartier's one right down.

1434
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:04,868
Where's Niketown?

1435
01:05:04,893 --> 01:05:05,450
What?

1436
01:05:05,475 --> 01:05:06,262
Niketown.

1437
01:05:06,287 --> 01:05:07,219
Niketown?

1438
01:05:07,601 --> 01:05:08,977
Bad day, my ass.

1439
01:05:21,694 --> 01:05:22,763
Wait a minute.

1440
01:05:23,643 --> 01:05:25,044
Dr. Chamberlain?

1441
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:27,299
All right.

1442
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,040
Hello?

1443
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:34,866
Hey, Andy.

1444
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:36,954
Yeah. What are they?

1445
01:05:39,205 --> 01:05:41,352
Chewable vitamin Cs, huh?

1446
01:05:42,142 --> 01:05:43,264
Okay, thanks.

1447
01:05:52,551 --> 01:05:54,875
I know. I can't believe
the wedding's only a week away.

1448
01:05:56,847 --> 01:05:58,731
No, we do the final
walk-through on Monday.

1449
01:05:58,756 --> 01:05:59,697
Oh!

1450
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,340
Wait a minute. I think
I hear her car.

1451
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:06,637
Drop my stuff
at my house, okay?

1452
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,035
All right.
Look crazy.

1453
01:06:23,433 --> 01:06:24,311
Ouh!

1454
01:06:24,336 --> 01:06:25,252
Charlie!

1455
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:32,973
Charlie!

1456
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,019
Oh, I had to bring him
home with me today.

1457
01:06:35,044 --> 01:06:36,028
He's harmless.

1458
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:38,459
Sit.

1459
01:06:38,484 --> 01:06:39,251
No!

1460
01:06:39,276 --> 01:06:40,812
No. No.

1461
01:06:40,837 --> 01:06:42,124
No, Zorro! Sit!

1462
01:06:42,837 --> 01:06:43,615
Ugh!

1463
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:50,905
Is that expensive?

1464
01:06:53,793 --> 01:06:54,709
It was.

1465
01:06:59,577 --> 01:07:00,517
Sorry!

1466
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:13,453
Oh!

1467
01:07:16,235 --> 01:07:17,720
Charlie!

1468
01:07:21,112 --> 01:07:21,901
Bonus.

1469
01:07:23,284 --> 01:07:24,565
Good boy.

1470
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:25,510
Come on.

1471
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:27,207
Come on.

1472
01:07:31,585 --> 01:07:32,540
Mmm.

1473
01:07:33,969 --> 01:07:36,218
Hello, old friend.

1474
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:37,610
Viola!

1475
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,043
You can't mix alcohol
with your pills!

1476
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:44,829
I'm a little upset

1477
01:07:44,854 --> 01:07:46,353
as you can imagine.

1478
01:07:46,732 --> 01:07:48,792
Well, I know that
and I'm sorry,

1479
01:07:48,817 --> 01:07:50,956
but your doctor said

1480
01:07:50,981 --> 01:07:52,218
if you're feeling upset,

1481
01:07:52,243 --> 01:07:54,468
then you should take
your pills, not alcohol.

1482
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,410
So you relax.
I'll get them.

1483
01:08:01,739 --> 01:08:02,713
Shit.

1484
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,515
Here we go.

1485
01:08:21,952 --> 01:08:23,367
This'll make you feel better.

1486
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:24,850
Drink up.

1487
01:08:29,223 --> 01:08:31,021
Now I hope you like
what I made.

1488
01:08:31,689 --> 01:08:33,834
It's one of my mother's
specialties.

1489
01:08:38,049 --> 01:08:39,258
What's that?

1490
01:08:39,747 --> 01:08:40,660
Tripe.

1491
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:42,324
It's a delicacy.

1492
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,165
Try it.

1493
01:08:49,398 --> 01:08:52,363
It's like nothing
you've ever tasted.

1494
01:08:52,894 --> 01:08:53,824
Trust me.

1495
01:08:59,701 --> 01:09:00,987
So Kevin called.

1496
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,076
He's coming home tomorrow.
I can't wait.

1497
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:05,103
I'm so excited.
I miss him so much.

1498
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:07,605
I was thinking maybe the three of us
could go to lunch tomorrow.

1499
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:08,539
What do you think?

1500
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:11,438
Yeah, I think it's
a great idea too.

1501
01:09:11,728 --> 01:09:13,342
I'll make reservations.

1502
01:09:14,224 --> 01:09:16,085
It'll be so much fun.

1503
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:18,718
Don't you just love
being girlfriends?

1504
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:29,158
Night-night,
sleep tight.

1505
01:09:42,067 --> 01:09:43,941
And good morning
to you too.

1506
01:09:46,928 --> 01:09:48,237
Ruby, is that you?

1507
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:49,173
In here!

1508
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,453
Oh my God.
Is she all right?

1509
01:09:55,004 --> 01:09:56,460
I thought she went
to bed.

1510
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,070
I don't know.

1511
01:09:58,095 --> 01:10:00,726
I haven't seen her like this
since "The View" won an Emmy.

1512
01:10:01,728 --> 01:10:03,037
I wish I could stay and help

1513
01:10:03,062 --> 01:10:05,270
but I have to go
pick up Kevin at the airport.

1514
01:10:10,299 --> 01:10:11,241
What?

1515
01:10:11,892 --> 01:10:13,470
I underestimated you.

1516
01:10:14,101 --> 01:10:15,604
You don't need a gun.

1517
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,148
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1518
01:10:21,173 --> 01:10:22,384
Mm-hm.

1519
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:27,717
Last call!

1520
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:33,371
We'll see you
tomorrow night.

1521
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:37,185
Uh, there's a reservation
under Fields, Kevin.

1522
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,493
Yes, right this way.

1523
01:10:39,449 --> 01:10:42,096
I'm so glad my mom and you
had a great week.

1524
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:44,082
We did. I learned
a lot about her.

1525
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,902
So who's
the mystery guest?

1526
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:48,404
Oh, surprise!

1527
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,833
I thought your office
said we were having lunch alone.

1528
01:10:52,858 --> 01:10:55,685
Well, I hope you guys
forgive me. I just...

1529
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,842
I wanted to talk
to you and Kevin together.

1530
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:02,481
So how are you, Mom?

1531
01:11:02,506 --> 01:11:03,243
Fine.

1532
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:08,446
Although I did have
a rather difficult night.

1533
01:11:08,471 --> 01:11:11,217
Ooh, it was probably
that martini you had.

1534
01:11:12,087 --> 01:11:15,329
Mom, you're not supposed to drink alcohol
with those pills you're taking.

1535
01:11:16,799 --> 01:11:18,817
You know, the truth is

1536
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:20,479
I owe you an apology.

1537
01:11:21,201 --> 01:11:23,103
You know, I was so insensitive
to your feelings

1538
01:11:23,128 --> 01:11:25,222
about wanting to help
with the wedding.

1539
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,134
Oh,

1540
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,718
it's ancient history.

1541
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,282
A young bride doesn't want to hear
the opinions of an old widow.

1542
01:11:30,307 --> 01:11:32,439
No no,
that is not true.

1543
01:11:32,464 --> 01:11:34,377
I mean, you're gonna be my mom soon.

1544
01:11:36,676 --> 01:11:39,379
And a grandma shortly
after, hopefully.

1545
01:11:42,169 --> 01:11:45,313
And I want you to know
that I will do anything it takes

1546
01:11:45,338 --> 01:11:47,157
to make this relationship work.

1547
01:11:49,754 --> 01:11:51,500
That said...

1548
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,651
will you be my maid...

1549
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,188
I mean, my matron of honor?

1550
01:11:56,958 --> 01:11:58,051
Charlie, that's...

1551
01:11:58,076 --> 01:11:59,152
that's amazing.

1552
01:11:59,177 --> 01:12:01,192
- Mom, what do you say?
- But, uh...

1553
01:12:01,736 --> 01:12:03,598
Morgan is gonna be
your maid of honor.

1554
01:12:03,623 --> 01:12:06,766
Oh no, she has graciously
relinquished her title to you.

1555
01:12:08,356 --> 01:12:09,712
And I had this
specially made up.

1556
01:12:09,737 --> 01:12:12,728
A dress in your
favorite color, peach.

1557
01:12:14,135 --> 01:12:15,238
Come on, open it.

1558
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,005
Well, that's...

1559
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:18,379
Char... ah.

1560
01:12:23,393 --> 01:12:25,105
I don't think I can.

1561
01:12:25,405 --> 01:12:26,804
Mom, I think
it's a great idea.

1562
01:12:26,829 --> 01:12:28,528
Well, I just don't think
I'm up to it.

1563
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:31,023
I really don't. I've got
to talk to my doctor.

1564
01:12:31,048 --> 01:12:32,392
Oh, I called him.

1565
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:33,103
Yeah!

1566
01:12:33,128 --> 01:12:34,921
And he said he thought
it was a great idea.

1567
01:12:36,808 --> 01:12:38,351
You called my psychiatrist?

1568
01:12:38,376 --> 01:12:39,294
Mm-hmm.

1569
01:12:39,495 --> 01:12:41,782
In fact, we had lunch
at The lvy.

1570
01:12:42,949 --> 01:12:43,991
Well, anyway,

1571
01:12:44,016 --> 01:12:46,532
he said, considering, you know,
this turning point in your life,

1572
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:49,642
you know, losing so much
so suddenly,

1573
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:51,157
that being involved in the future

1574
01:12:51,182 --> 01:12:53,703
would be the best therapy
in the world for you right now.

1575
01:12:53,728 --> 01:12:55,547
Careful. You know
those are strong.

1576
01:12:56,835 --> 01:12:58,852
You know, we...

1577
01:12:58,877 --> 01:13:00,650
are your future.

1578
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:02,363
And we want you
to be part of it.

1579
01:13:02,388 --> 01:13:03,458
So...

1580
01:13:04,793 --> 01:13:07,008
I can have a list of duties
for you tomorrow.

1581
01:13:08,147 --> 01:13:08,923
No.

1582
01:13:11,127 --> 01:13:12,417
Mom... no, Mom.

1583
01:13:12,962 --> 01:13:14,034
Mom, don't cry.

1584
01:13:15,862 --> 01:13:16,620
Here.

1585
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:22,066
Charlie.

1586
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:25,369
I didn't think
I would be this emotional.

1587
01:13:25,394 --> 01:13:26,963
Mom, here.
Can I?

1588
01:13:30,298 --> 01:13:31,755
Thank you, baby.
I love you.

1589
01:13:32,122 --> 01:13:33,786
- I love you too.
- I love you too!

1590
01:13:33,811 --> 01:13:35,184
I love you too, Mom.

1591
01:13:36,982 --> 01:13:37,666
Kevin, you know what?

1592
01:13:37,691 --> 01:13:40,209
Why don't you give your mom and I
a moment alone?

1593
01:13:40,234 --> 01:13:41,277
Yes, of course.

1594
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,613
Just so you know,
the crying bits are getting old.

1595
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:52,363
Just so you know,
Kevin likes his girls thin.

1596
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:54,413
Oh! Well,
I could always get liposuction.

1597
01:13:54,438 --> 01:13:56,495
I've been meaning to ask.
Is it painful?

1598
01:13:57,124 --> 01:13:59,195
That maid of honor bit.

1599
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:00,954
Priceless!

1600
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:02,111
Well, you know what they say?

1601
01:14:02,136 --> 01:14:05,201
Keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer.

1602
01:14:05,226 --> 01:14:06,034
Oh!

1603
01:14:06,059 --> 01:14:07,728
Now you listen to me.

1604
01:14:07,753 --> 01:14:09,478
This is my game now.

1605
01:14:09,503 --> 01:14:12,511
You are going to tell Kevin that you
are not moving into our neighborhood,

1606
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:14,778
and that you've decided
that you're feeling like it's time

1607
01:14:14,803 --> 01:14:17,170
that you go on with your own life!

1608
01:14:17,545 --> 01:14:19,942
You're moving out
of our house immediately.

1609
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:22,235
This is over!

1610
01:14:25,655 --> 01:14:29,302
This isn't over,
not even close, girlie!

1611
01:14:29,327 --> 01:14:31,004
Well, bring it on,
Grandma.

1612
01:14:33,992 --> 01:14:35,270
That little bitch!

1613
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,931
Let's go someplace near
the ocean and drink lunch.

1614
01:14:40,097 --> 01:14:41,033
What?

1615
01:14:41,682 --> 01:14:43,441
You know exactly what.

1616
01:14:44,425 --> 01:14:45,257
Move!

1617
01:14:45,282 --> 01:14:47,315
Move! Move!

1618
01:14:48,763 --> 01:14:50,327
What's wrong with you?

1619
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:51,540
I am sick.

1620
01:14:51,565 --> 01:14:54,617
I am sick sick
sick of your shit.

1621
01:14:54,642 --> 01:14:56,969
And I when I'm not sick,
I'm tired.

1622
01:14:56,994 --> 01:14:59,258
I am sick and tired.

1623
01:14:59,822 --> 01:15:01,423
What are you saying?

1624
01:15:02,227 --> 01:15:04,110
Damn you
and your luggage!

1625
01:15:04,135 --> 01:15:06,991
Ruby, you're not gonna leave me too,
are you?

1626
01:15:07,681 --> 01:15:09,782
Oh, I'm leaving you.

1627
01:15:09,807 --> 01:15:11,163
You old slut!

1628
01:15:13,065 --> 01:15:14,000
Ruby!

1629
01:15:17,869 --> 01:15:18,603
Ruby, please...

1630
01:15:18,628 --> 01:15:20,286
Hey, you almost
forgot your dress!

1631
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:22,214
You'll have nothing
to wear to the wedding.

1632
01:15:23,337 --> 01:15:24,338
See you, Ruby!

1633
01:15:24,782 --> 01:15:26,759
Maybe we can get you
a matching bonnet.

1634
01:15:26,784 --> 01:15:28,721
See you
at the rehearsal dinner!

1635
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,215
Motherf...!

1636
01:15:46,344 --> 01:15:47,943
So, how's the bride-to-be
holding up?

1637
01:15:47,968 --> 01:15:50,529
Ooh, under the circumstances
I'd say mediocre.

1638
01:15:50,554 --> 01:15:51,639
But she's tough.

1639
01:15:51,664 --> 01:15:53,509
Not as tough
as the old bird.

1640
01:15:54,463 --> 01:15:55,275
What does that mean?

1641
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,635
For your own safety,

1642
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:00,500
make sure you know where
the emergency exits are at all times.

1643
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:05,657
Hey, are you
and my mom okay?

1644
01:16:05,682 --> 01:16:08,292
Great. Yeah, I just have a little
of the pre-wedding nerves,

1645
01:16:08,317 --> 01:16:10,151
but everything's
under control.

1646
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:11,650
Of course.

1647
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,217
Hello, everyone!

1648
01:16:17,242 --> 01:16:19,398
Welcome
to the rehearsal dinner.

1649
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,522
My God, she looks amazing.

1650
01:16:24,547 --> 01:16:25,387
I know.

1651
01:16:25,734 --> 01:16:26,276
Oh!

1652
01:16:27,718 --> 01:16:28,849
Father Tyson.

1653
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,555
Hello, Blaire.

1654
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,368
Hello.

1655
01:16:32,094 --> 01:16:33,239
Kit, how are you?

1656
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:34,144
Hello.

1657
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:37,313
- Oh, you are Morgan.
- Yes.

1658
01:16:37,338 --> 01:16:40,306
I have heard so much about your delicious
catering service.

1659
01:16:40,331 --> 01:16:42,228
Oh! Oh, wow!

1660
01:16:42,253 --> 01:16:44,968
I have a lot of friends.
You're gonna be a busy girl.

1661
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:48,098
And you're Remy.

1662
01:16:48,123 --> 01:16:48,667
Yeah.

1663
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:51,634
Oh, I recognize you from all the wonderful
things Charlie's told me about you.

1664
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:52,490
Wow.

1665
01:16:52,838 --> 01:16:54,187
Well, Ms. Fields,
I have to say...

1666
01:16:54,212 --> 01:16:57,308
Oh, call me Viola.
Please, I insist.

1667
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,212
Viola.

1668
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,511
All right, I'm gonna
go get a drink.

1669
01:17:00,536 --> 01:17:01,376
Okay.

1670
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:04,583
I am such a huge fan.

1671
01:17:04,617 --> 01:17:06,245
Oh, you sweet...

1672
01:17:06,508 --> 01:17:07,499
Oh, l...

1673
01:17:08,016 --> 01:17:10,436
Well, mi casa, su casa.
Make yourself at home.

1674
01:17:11,019 --> 01:17:11,643
Oh.

1675
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:12,924
Thank you.

1676
01:17:12,949 --> 01:17:13,943
Bye, Viola.

1677
01:17:14,345 --> 01:17:16,244
- Goodbye.
- I like her a lot. Hi.

1678
01:17:16,269 --> 01:17:17,258
- Hey!
- Hi!

1679
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:20,284
You guys have a nice
little chit-chat?

1680
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:22,179
Oh my God. She came over
and started talking to us.

1681
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:23,458
What did you want us to do?
Ignore her?

1682
01:17:23,483 --> 01:17:24,381
Yes!

1683
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:27,730
So then getting her autograph
would be completely out of the question?

1684
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:34,950
- Was that yes? 'Cause... okay.
- No.

1685
01:17:35,341 --> 01:17:37,655
So there I was sitting next
to the Sultan of Brunei

1686
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:41,251
with Maureen Dowd,
Carrie Fisher and Snoop Dogg.

1687
01:17:41,276 --> 01:17:43,098
You know the story, Kevin.
And...

1688
01:17:43,123 --> 01:17:45,067
I said to Snoop, "Snoop,
I think your lyrics

1689
01:17:45,092 --> 01:17:48,005
are sometimes a little sexist
and unfair to women."

1690
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,441
And the Sultan of Brunei said,
"Really? I have 114 wives

1691
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:53,328
and they're all
huge fans of the Dogg!"

1692
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:02,621
Honey, would you see
who's at the door?

1693
01:18:02,646 --> 01:18:03,444
Sure.

1694
01:18:06,017 --> 01:18:07,675
These are delicious, Viola.

1695
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,526
Oh, Kit,
I'm glad you like it.

1696
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:10,714
Mm, yeah.

1697
01:18:11,657 --> 01:18:13,624
Look who's here.
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1698
01:18:13,948 --> 01:18:15,350
Oh my God!

1699
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:16,684
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1700
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:19,057
Hi! Everybody,
it's Dr. Chamberlain!

1701
01:18:19,082 --> 01:18:20,036
Hi. Good evening.

1702
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:21,447
Thanks so much
for inviting me.

1703
01:18:21,472 --> 01:18:22,557
Oh, shit!

1704
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:24,345
That's Dr. Chamberlain.

1705
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:25,363
Viola's doctor.

1706
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:27,464
Oh, we're gonna need
another place setting.

1707
01:18:27,489 --> 01:18:29,205
Oh, please,
let me get that.

1708
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:30,742
And there's a chair
in the living room.

1709
01:18:30,767 --> 01:18:31,211
Sure.

1710
01:18:31,236 --> 01:18:32,905
Well, scootch down, you guys.

1711
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,173
Come on, make room.

1712
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:36,360
Remi, you guys move down.

1713
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:38,268
Cheers. Thank you.

1714
01:18:38,838 --> 01:18:39,721
Who's he?

1715
01:18:39,746 --> 01:18:41,490
It's Viola's therapist.

1716
01:18:41,515 --> 01:18:42,514
Move down, you guys!

1717
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:47,830
Here's you chair, Doctor.

1718
01:18:47,855 --> 01:18:49,135
Here. Have mine, too.

1719
01:18:50,414 --> 01:18:51,460
Hello.

1720
01:18:51,485 --> 01:18:51,995
Hi.

1721
01:18:52,888 --> 01:18:53,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

1722
01:18:57,093 --> 01:18:57,927
I'll get it.

1723
01:18:58,686 --> 01:19:00,061
So you just got here?

1724
01:19:00,086 --> 01:19:01,128
You expecting anyone else?

1725
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:01,935
Mm-hmm.

1726
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,490
Hello, everybody!

1727
01:19:03,515 --> 01:19:04,348
Fiona!

1728
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:06,400
I'm so glad to see you.

1729
01:19:06,948 --> 01:19:10,380
I just couldn't resist bringing
the happy couple a little gift.

1730
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:14,092
That's great. I will
get you a place setting.

1731
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,548
She's bringing a gift?

1732
01:19:15,573 --> 01:19:16,895
I think she is the gift.

1733
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:19,144
What the hell's she doing here?

1734
01:19:19,169 --> 01:19:20,843
Hey, how about some
more wine, everyone?

1735
01:19:20,868 --> 01:19:22,220
Yeah!

1736
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:24,138
How much longer do
we have to stay?

1737
01:19:24,163 --> 01:19:25,327
I have midterms tomorrow.

1738
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:27,866
Oh, I get it.

1739
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:29,394
No, baby, not now, okay?

1740
01:19:29,419 --> 01:19:30,444
It's not the time.

1741
01:19:31,863 --> 01:19:34,437
So, Dr. Chamberlain,

1742
01:19:34,462 --> 01:19:36,526
tell us about med school.
Where did you do your residency?

1743
01:19:36,551 --> 01:19:38,327
Uh, now that's...

1744
01:19:38,352 --> 01:19:39,152
That's a long story.

1745
01:19:39,177 --> 01:19:40,651
I don't think your guests
want to hear that.

1746
01:19:40,676 --> 01:19:41,679
No, we really wanna know.

1747
01:19:41,704 --> 01:19:43,515
I think we need
some more gravy.

1748
01:19:49,511 --> 01:19:50,920
What is going on?

1749
01:19:52,061 --> 01:19:52,724
What are you doing?

1750
01:19:52,749 --> 01:19:53,724
I'm behaving.

1751
01:19:55,443 --> 01:19:56,554
Viola, no!

1752
01:19:56,856 --> 01:19:57,676
You can't!

1753
01:19:57,701 --> 01:19:58,923
Charlie's allergic to nuts!

1754
01:19:58,948 --> 01:19:59,847
Give it to me!

1755
01:20:07,491 --> 01:20:09,296
Viola, you're crazy.

1756
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:15,372
Oh, get up.

1757
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,642
Put the gravy down
or I'm telling Kevin.

1758
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,239
Yeah!

1759
01:20:21,861 --> 01:20:22,704
What's the big deal?

1760
01:20:22,729 --> 01:20:24,329
So her face swells up...

1761
01:20:24,748 --> 01:20:26,578
swells up a little.
So what?

1762
01:20:26,603 --> 01:20:27,590
Swells up a little?

1763
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:29,795
Her face'll blow up like
a Macy's Day balloon.

1764
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,878
Well, good. It'll match
the other body parts!

1765
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:35,129
Viola, think about
what you're doing.

1766
01:20:35,396 --> 01:20:37,554
Come on, the girl's
getting married tomorrow!

1767
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:39,253
Ruby, when did you
lose your edge?

1768
01:20:39,278 --> 01:20:40,878
Right after
you lost your mind.

1769
01:20:42,188 --> 01:20:42,953
Come on.

1770
01:20:42,978 --> 01:20:44,975
All right. Okay.
No nuts.

1771
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:45,763
Come on.

1772
01:20:46,202 --> 01:20:48,735
Viola, I think you
dislocated my vagina.

1773
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,171
Where's the...

1774
01:20:50,196 --> 01:20:50,881
Where's the what?

1775
01:20:50,906 --> 01:20:52,139
Gravy? More gravy?

1776
01:20:52,164 --> 01:20:53,983
Anyone for more gravy?

1777
01:20:54,562 --> 01:20:57,211
Oh, I am not
doing time for you!

1778
01:20:57,236 --> 01:20:57,942
Where's the back door?

1779
01:20:57,967 --> 01:20:58,790
Stay cool, Ruby!

1780
01:20:58,815 --> 01:20:59,311
Stay cool!

1781
01:20:59,336 --> 01:21:00,474
This is no time to
lose your nerve.

1782
01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:03,025
Oh, if we get arrested
I'm gonna sing like a canary.

1783
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:04,992
Maybe she won't
take any gravy.

1784
01:21:05,017 --> 01:21:06,731
That's a lot of gravy.

1785
01:21:06,756 --> 01:21:07,579
Mmm!

1786
01:21:08,306 --> 01:21:09,633
This gravy's delicious!

1787
01:21:10,877 --> 01:21:12,399
You... you gotta go
stop her!

1788
01:21:12,424 --> 01:21:13,349
Come on, stop her.
Go stop her.

1789
01:21:13,374 --> 01:21:15,014
No, you go, you go.

1790
01:21:15,936 --> 01:21:17,778
Why me?
You're the culprit? You go!

1791
01:21:17,803 --> 01:21:19,360
You're my assistant.

1792
01:21:19,385 --> 01:21:20,300
What am I supposed to do?

1793
01:21:20,325 --> 01:21:22,894
Go out there and stick my finger
down her throat?

1794
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:23,724
Yeah.

1795
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,191
Baby, you okay?

1796
01:21:26,683 --> 01:21:28,465
Kevin, my tongue
feels weird.

1797
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:29,932
I think
something's wrong!

1798
01:21:30,992 --> 01:21:32,020
Charlie, are you okay?

1799
01:21:32,045 --> 01:21:33,638
What are we gonna do now?

1800
01:21:33,663 --> 01:21:34,947
Hide the damn nuts!

1801
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:38,948
Are you all right?

1802
01:21:38,973 --> 01:21:40,006
Get her some water.

1803
01:21:44,263 --> 01:21:45,573
Flat or sparkling?

1804
01:21:47,386 --> 01:21:49,844
The caterer says he doesn't know how
this could have happened.

1805
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:52,757
Well, I feel like I ate
a loaf of nuts.

1806
01:21:53,052 --> 01:21:55,069
I mean, even my tongue
is swollen.

1807
01:21:56,717 --> 01:22:01,325
You're marrying a big, fat,
puffy tomato mouth.

1808
01:22:03,094 --> 01:22:05,618
It's not that bad, really. Besides,
the swelling's already going down.

1809
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,104
- Yeah?
- Hey, Kev.

1810
01:22:08,129 --> 01:22:08,760
Yeah.

1811
01:22:08,785 --> 01:22:10,413
Just coming to
check up on the bride-to-be.

1812
01:22:10,438 --> 01:22:11,772
For the love of God...

1813
01:22:11,797 --> 01:22:12,574
Out!

1814
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:13,614
You see?

1815
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:15,944
I told you it looks terrible.

1816
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:16,912
I told you.

1817
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:17,929
Baby, I promise you.

1818
01:22:17,954 --> 01:22:20,512
In 24 hours the swelling
will be completely gone.

1819
01:22:21,298 --> 01:22:22,281
Give me that!

1820
01:22:47,714 --> 01:22:48,840
The door was open.

1821
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,891
Oh thank God.

1822
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:54,284
The bride of Frankenstein is gone.

1823
01:22:54,309 --> 01:22:55,189
I know.

1824
01:22:55,214 --> 01:22:56,841
I was up half
the night worrying.

1825
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:57,628
I know.

1826
01:22:57,652 --> 01:22:58,589
You look great.

1827
01:22:58,614 --> 01:23:00,335
I just don't know how
those nuts got in there.

1828
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,300
Yeah.

1829
01:23:01,545 --> 01:23:02,431
Hmm.

1830
01:23:03,036 --> 01:23:03,979
Wait.

1831
01:23:04,296 --> 01:23:06,125
Do you think
she would...

1832
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:09,805
No!

1833
01:23:10,316 --> 01:23:11,194
Come on.

1834
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:12,834
I mean, she's crazy,

1835
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:15,985
but she's not like,
psycho-killer crazy.

1836
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:16,915
Hmm.

1837
01:23:19,697 --> 01:23:20,720
No!

1838
01:23:22,758 --> 01:23:25,692
Oh, hey, I was wondering.
Could I bring a date

1839
01:23:25,717 --> 01:23:27,068
to your wedding?

1840
01:23:27,533 --> 01:23:28,803
Of course.

1841
01:23:29,303 --> 01:23:30,715
My God. How exciting.

1842
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:33,149
Great. Thanks.
So then, I'll see you later.

1843
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,546
Wait!

1844
01:23:34,571 --> 01:23:35,573
Who is he? Tell me!

1845
01:23:35,598 --> 01:23:36,371
Oh, it's...

1846
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:38,276
Um, okay, don't be mad.

1847
01:23:38,301 --> 01:23:39,817
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1848
01:23:39,842 --> 01:23:41,284
Actually "Paul."

1849
01:23:42,086 --> 01:23:43,143
Is that his real name?

1850
01:23:43,168 --> 01:23:44,399
That's very funny.

1851
01:23:44,424 --> 01:23:46,844
I gotta go get a mani, pedi
and get my eyebrows waxed.

1852
01:23:46,869 --> 01:23:48,574
But I'll see you in
a couple of hours, okay?

1853
01:23:48,599 --> 01:23:49,850
Oh, let me go down with you.

1854
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:50,657
Okay.

1855
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,297
Ugh, God!

1856
01:23:58,125 --> 01:23:59,689
She added
even more ruffles!

1857
01:24:00,009 --> 01:24:02,211
Where's your prom date,
señorita?

1858
01:24:03,751 --> 01:24:06,188
Oh, wait a minute.
This is too damn good.

1859
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:08,530
Where's my camera?
This is just too good.

1860
01:24:08,555 --> 01:24:11,456
Will you just get me
out of this right now?

1861
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:12,555
Come here.

1862
01:24:31,078 --> 01:24:31,956
Cheers.

1863
01:24:32,344 --> 01:24:33,095
Hey.

1864
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:36,337
Thanks for coming.

1865
01:24:36,743 --> 01:24:38,744
Okay, guys, let's go see
how Charlie's doing.

1866
01:24:39,054 --> 01:24:40,485
Ah, yes, please.

1867
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:41,393
Uh-huh.

1868
01:24:42,378 --> 01:24:43,536
Oh my God.

1869
01:24:43,561 --> 01:24:45,281
Those are so much better than mine.

1870
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,156
Don't... touch me!

1871
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:57,403
I got out of that car
the same way I got in it

1872
01:24:57,428 --> 01:24:58,752
without you.

1873
01:24:59,347 --> 01:25:00,564
Now where is she?

1874
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:09,964
You here with the bride
or the groom?

1875
01:25:09,989 --> 01:25:11,922
I'm here with my mother.

1876
01:25:11,947 --> 01:25:12,702
Oh.

1877
01:25:17,343 --> 01:25:18,990
She looked a lot older. I...

1878
01:25:22,642 --> 01:25:24,818
Well, look
what we have here.

1879
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:27,048
Oh my God.

1880
01:25:27,603 --> 01:25:29,884
You look beautiful.
Oh my God.

1881
01:25:30,189 --> 01:25:31,200
Oh my God.

1882
01:25:31,225 --> 01:25:32,106
This is it!

1883
01:25:32,131 --> 01:25:32,944
Yeah!

1884
01:25:34,143 --> 01:25:35,892
Oh God, did you talk to the priest?

1885
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:36,596
I talked to him.

1886
01:25:36,621 --> 01:25:39,427
He's just gonna skip right over that whole
"if anyone should object" part.

1887
01:25:39,452 --> 01:25:40,539
Okay.

1888
01:25:40,834 --> 01:25:44,197
You're a vision in white,
sweetie, really.

1889
01:25:44,496 --> 01:25:45,514
Knock knock.

1890
01:25:46,338 --> 01:25:47,735
Look at you!

1891
01:25:48,523 --> 01:25:51,341
And so is your
mother-in-law.

1892
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:53,882
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

1893
01:25:55,309 --> 01:25:57,011
All right.
Everybody out.

1894
01:25:57,693 --> 01:25:59,388
Out.
Give the bride a moment.

1895
01:26:02,716 --> 01:26:03,937
No way.

1896
01:26:04,354 --> 01:26:05,280
What?

1897
01:26:11,677 --> 01:26:12,912
What is that?

1898
01:26:12,937 --> 01:26:13,919
What?

1899
01:26:13,944 --> 01:26:15,246
Where's your
bridesmaid's dress?

1900
01:26:15,839 --> 01:26:17,641
Oh, I gave it
to Ruby's daughter.

1901
01:26:17,889 --> 01:26:20,041
She works at Hooters.
She was thrilled.

1902
01:26:20,066 --> 01:26:21,635
I don't have a daughter.

1903
01:26:21,863 --> 01:26:22,694
Oh.

1904
01:26:24,003 --> 01:26:24,739
Rude.

1905
01:26:27,155 --> 01:26:28,774
Take off that white dress right now

1906
01:26:28,799 --> 01:26:30,341
or I'll take it off for you.

1907
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:34,494
Don't you tell me
what to do!

1908
01:26:35,902 --> 01:26:37,428
You did not
just poke me!

1909
01:26:37,453 --> 01:26:40,158
Don't you touch me,
you two-bit tramp!

1910
01:26:42,368 --> 01:26:43,282
Oh my God!

1911
01:26:43,315 --> 01:26:44,616
Viola, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

1912
01:26:47,133 --> 01:26:48,986
You don't go and slap somebody
then apologize.

1913
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:50,697
Get some backbone!

1914
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:59,463
God! This is crazy!

1915
01:26:59,488 --> 01:27:01,029
Why don't you just
face it?

1916
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:03,517
I'm marrying Kevin today and there's
nothing you can do about it.

1917
01:27:03,542 --> 01:27:04,535
You face it!

1918
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,536
You'll never be good
enough for him!

1919
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:09,267
Didn't stop you
from marrying my son.

1920
01:27:09,612 --> 01:27:11,081
Oh God, no.

1921
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,853
Well, look at you.

1922
01:27:13,321 --> 01:27:14,644
All in white.

1923
01:27:14,974 --> 01:27:17,554
You are so predictable.

1924
01:27:17,579 --> 01:27:19,013
Oh, Gertrude.

1925
01:27:19,038 --> 01:27:20,606
I didn't know you were coming.

1926
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:22,003
You didn't?

1927
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:23,376
Wonder why.

1928
01:27:23,401 --> 01:27:24,830
Oh, I know.

1929
01:27:25,312 --> 01:27:27,554
You didn't send me
an invitation!

1930
01:27:27,579 --> 01:27:29,126
I thought you were dead.

1931
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:30,766
But evil doesn't die
so easily.

1932
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:33,642
I heard you got sacked
and thrown into a loony bin.

1933
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:34,172
Oh!

1934
01:27:34,197 --> 01:27:35,381
My congratulations.

1935
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:36,265
Oh.

1936
01:27:36,848 --> 01:27:38,150
Oh my God.

1937
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,201
Oh my God!

1938
01:27:40,226 --> 01:27:42,539
These hors d'oeuvres
taste like old socks.

1939
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:48,540
Now, I wanna get an
up-close look at the bride.

1940
01:27:49,068 --> 01:27:50,282
Holy Toledo!

1941
01:27:50,815 --> 01:27:53,358
You are a stunner!

1942
01:27:53,984 --> 01:27:55,929
My grandson
is a lucky fella.

1943
01:27:55,954 --> 01:27:56,706
Look, what he did.

1944
01:27:56,731 --> 01:28:01,622
He went out and found
himself an exotic Latina!

1945
01:28:03,053 --> 01:28:05,573
Would that my son
had been that lucky.

1946
01:28:05,598 --> 01:28:06,827
Here we go again.

1947
01:28:06,852 --> 01:28:07,892
What?

1948
01:28:07,917 --> 01:28:11,183
You were a television weatherwoman
in Dubuque, Montana.

1949
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:13,749
You drove around
in your broken-down minivan

1950
01:28:13,774 --> 01:28:16,889
and you drank red wine
from a box!

1951
01:28:19,856 --> 01:28:21,061
Classy.

1952
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:23,173
You killed him,
you know?

1953
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:23,851
What?!

1954
01:28:23,876 --> 01:28:25,102
You killed him.

1955
01:28:25,127 --> 01:28:27,123
All the doctors agreed,

1956
01:28:27,148 --> 01:28:30,985
my son died
of terminal disappointment!

1957
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,935
If anybody killed him,
you did.

1958
01:28:33,622 --> 01:28:34,831
You smothered him
to death!

1959
01:28:34,856 --> 01:28:36,578
Nobody was ever
good enough for him!

1960
01:28:38,804 --> 01:28:40,472
My God, you look old!

1961
01:28:43,547 --> 01:28:44,258
Fine.

1962
01:28:44,934 --> 01:28:46,990
This woman's gonna drive me insane.

1963
01:28:47,015 --> 01:28:50,257
Now, I'd rather not
take all the credit.

1964
01:28:54,799 --> 01:28:55,796
You'll get over it.

1965
01:28:58,469 --> 01:28:59,829
Okay, I love you.

1966
01:28:59,854 --> 01:29:00,797
You're kidding.

1967
01:29:14,857 --> 01:29:16,744
This is never gonna end, is it?

1968
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:20,532
I mean, that's gonna be
me and you in 30 years.

1969
01:29:20,557 --> 01:29:22,777
We'll be doing
the exact same thing.

1970
01:29:27,257 --> 01:29:28,456
You know what?

1971
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,016
I wanted to marry Kevin
because we make each other happy.

1972
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,636
But you're never gonna
let that happen.

1973
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:38,643
Are you?

1974
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:43,988
Oh my God.
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1975
01:29:49,523 --> 01:29:50,980
You win, Viola.

1976
01:29:53,355 --> 01:29:54,543
What do you mean?

1977
01:29:55,387 --> 01:29:56,328
The wedding's off.

1978
01:29:58,174 --> 01:29:59,165
Bye, Ruby.

1979
01:30:03,055 --> 01:30:06,066
I cannot believe
she compared me to Gertrude.

1980
01:30:06,091 --> 01:30:07,251
I know.

1981
01:30:07,276 --> 01:30:08,581
Now that's just wrong.

1982
01:30:08,956 --> 01:30:09,763
Thank you.

1983
01:30:09,788 --> 01:30:11,166
You are far worse.

1984
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:12,032
Yeah.

1985
01:30:12,057 --> 01:30:14,774
I don't recall Gertrude
ever trying to poison you.

1986
01:30:14,799 --> 01:30:16,936
And I'm pretty sure
she wore black to your wedding.

1987
01:30:16,961 --> 01:30:17,783
Black.

1988
01:30:17,808 --> 01:30:19,317
Yeah, she said she was in mourning.

1989
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:20,156
Mm-hmm.

1990
01:30:21,972 --> 01:30:24,075
I just want my son
to be happy.

1991
01:30:25,309 --> 01:30:27,292
Whatever made you
think he wasn't?

1992
01:30:36,555 --> 01:30:38,234
Hey, what are you
doing here?

1993
01:30:38,786 --> 01:30:40,564
Don't you know it's
bad luck to see the...

1994
01:30:41,714 --> 01:30:42,895
Charlie, what's wrong?

1995
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:46,357
What is it?

1996
01:30:47,231 --> 01:30:48,480
Are you nervous?

1997
01:30:48,505 --> 01:30:49,340
Hey.

1998
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:54,189
Kevin, I need...

1999
01:30:54,214 --> 01:30:55,274
Charlie,

2000
01:30:55,848 --> 01:30:57,264
I need to talk to you.

2001
01:30:57,289 --> 01:30:58,030
Viola, stop it!

2002
01:30:58,055 --> 01:31:00,012
Uh, it's the flower girls.

2003
01:31:00,649 --> 01:31:02,130
They're drunk again.

2004
01:31:02,532 --> 01:31:03,153
What?

2005
01:31:03,178 --> 01:31:05,016
Yeah, in the toilet.

2006
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,664
Not now, Viola, okay?

2007
01:31:06,689 --> 01:31:08,307
It's really important.

2008
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,684
Mom, just give us a minute.
She'll be right there.

2009
01:31:13,332 --> 01:31:14,403
Please?

2010
01:31:15,545 --> 01:31:16,691
Charlie, what is it?

2011
01:31:21,662 --> 01:31:22,844
I'll be right back.

2012
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,175
What do you want, Viola?

2013
01:31:32,007 --> 01:31:34,860
I don't want you
to walk out on this wedding.

2014
01:31:35,519 --> 01:31:36,705
You don't?

2015
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:38,346
No, I don't.

2016
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:41,515
What, am I supposed to believe
that you've had some epiphany?

2017
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:44,056
That all of the sudden,
everything's gonna be different?

2018
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:46,077
It's never been
about you, Charlie.

2019
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:47,702
It's me.

2020
01:31:48,029 --> 01:31:49,840
I've been so afraid
of losing him.

2021
01:31:49,865 --> 01:31:52,038
He's the only family
I've got.

2022
01:31:53,324 --> 01:31:55,345
This is my chance
for a family, too.

2023
01:31:57,001 --> 01:31:58,019
And I'm scared.

2024
01:31:58,044 --> 01:31:58,766
Oh!

2025
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,332
Don't blow your chance
for happiness.

2026
01:32:01,961 --> 01:32:03,229
You've never needed
my approval.

2027
01:32:03,254 --> 01:32:05,413
He's loved you
from the very beginning.

2028
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:09,368
And I promise I will
get out of the way

2029
01:32:09,393 --> 01:32:11,156
and let the two of you
be happy.

2030
01:32:11,969 --> 01:32:13,332
That's not what I want.

2031
01:32:13,957 --> 01:32:16,933
I mean, there just has
to be some boundaries, Viola.

2032
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,356
I can do boundaries!

2033
01:32:20,966 --> 01:32:23,179
I don't love boundaries
but I can do them.

2034
01:32:23,554 --> 01:32:24,224
All right.

2035
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:26,865
How about the number of times
you call Kevin every day?

2036
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:29,004
Can we limit that to, like, one?

2037
01:32:29,029 --> 01:32:31,960
Oh, I need at least
four minimum.

2038
01:32:31,985 --> 01:32:33,507
He's 35 years old.

2039
01:32:33,532 --> 01:32:34,201
Three?

2040
01:32:34,226 --> 01:32:35,296
Two.

2041
01:32:35,321 --> 01:32:36,075
Deal.

2042
01:32:36,856 --> 01:32:38,810
Two long-ass calls!

2043
01:32:39,686 --> 01:32:41,770
When Kevin and I have kids,

2044
01:32:41,795 --> 01:32:43,691
he and I will decide
how they're raised.

2045
01:32:43,716 --> 01:32:44,435
All right.

2046
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,604
But you know I have raised 
one wonderful boy.

2047
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:49,566
- And my advice could be very...
- Will be solicited when needed.

2048
01:32:49,591 --> 01:32:52,579
All right, as long as one kid
is named after me.

2049
01:32:53,079 --> 01:32:54,095
Middle name.

2050
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:54,957
Deal.

2051
01:32:56,193 --> 01:32:57,136
What else?

2052
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,384
Holidays
and special occasions.

2053
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:01,895
Are you gonna keep
me away?

2054
01:33:02,754 --> 01:33:06,888
You must be present
for every Christmas,

2055
01:33:06,913 --> 01:33:08,759
Thanksgiving,

2056
01:33:08,784 --> 01:33:10,039
birthday,

2057
01:33:10,064 --> 01:33:11,564
school play,

2058
01:33:11,589 --> 01:33:12,700
clarinet recital

2059
01:33:12,725 --> 01:33:16,055
and soccer game
in our kids' lives.

2060
01:33:17,638 --> 01:33:19,912
I want you to love them
and spoil them

2061
01:33:19,937 --> 01:33:22,319
and teach 'em things
that Kevin and I can't.

2062
01:33:23,744 --> 01:33:25,822
Like how to throw
a right hook for example.

2063
01:33:29,549 --> 01:33:30,939
I want you there, Viola.

2064
01:33:32,223 --> 01:33:34,033
I do, up front and center.

2065
01:33:36,359 --> 01:33:38,904
On this point
I will not negotiate.

2066
01:33:40,138 --> 01:33:42,817
Damn. That girl can give
a nice little speech.

2067
01:33:44,472 --> 01:33:45,394
Deal?

2068
01:33:47,807 --> 01:33:49,067
Oh...

2069
01:33:49,092 --> 01:33:52,048
can they call me "Aunt Viola"
instead of "Grandma"?

2070
01:33:52,484 --> 01:33:53,310
Fine.

2071
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:06,502
Come on, unzip me.

2072
01:34:07,389 --> 01:34:09,550
Viola, you don't
have to wear that dress, really.

2073
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:12,472
Yes, I do. Really.

2074
01:34:17,623 --> 01:34:19,432
Kevin and Charlie!

2075
01:34:26,148 --> 01:34:27,013
Yeah!

2076
01:34:43,164 --> 01:34:43,955
Mom!

2077
01:34:46,196 --> 01:34:48,347
Do you really think I'd leave without
saying goodbye?

2078
01:34:51,343 --> 01:34:52,346
I love you, Mom.

2079
01:34:53,393 --> 01:34:54,253
Thanks for everything.

2080
01:34:54,278 --> 01:34:54,981
Go.

2081
01:35:00,318 --> 01:35:02,594
Okay, everybody gather around
the back of the car!

2082
01:35:03,933 --> 01:35:05,051
Charlie!

2083
01:35:05,076 --> 01:35:06,793
Charlie, right here!

2084
01:35:06,818 --> 01:35:08,072
Right here, Charlie!

2085
01:35:27,854 --> 01:35:28,689
Shit.

2086
01:35:29,163 --> 01:35:31,107
Oh, Hawaii! I cannot wait!

2087
01:35:31,132 --> 01:35:32,256
I know. I can't either.

2088
01:35:34,445 --> 01:35:35,780
Have a great
time in Hawaii!

2089
01:35:35,805 --> 01:35:36,303
Good luck!

2090
01:35:36,328 --> 01:35:37,715
Have fun in Hawaii!

2091
01:35:42,697 --> 01:35:44,337
Just you and me
now, Ruby!

2092
01:35:44,362 --> 01:35:46,689
Jesus. Who'd I kill
in a past life?

2093
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,793
And take off
that damn dress.

2094
01:35:50,818 --> 01:35:52,432
You look like
a giant peach cobbler.

2095
01:35:52,457 --> 01:35:53,997
You're making me hungry.

2096
01:35:54,455 --> 01:35:57,478
Come on, weathergirl,
I'll buy you a box of wine.
