1
00:00:10,994 --> 00:00:12,344
Lisa!

2
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,914
Lisa!

3
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:35,549
Lisa!

4
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:01,183
Lisa!

5
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,440
What in the hell are you doing?

6
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:33,864
Stop it!

7
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:57,085
Honey, are you awake?

8
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:02,668
Can't you have breakfast with me
before I go to work?

9
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,100
Can't you stay in bed a little longer?

10
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:11,507
I don't have time.
What would we do in that case?

11
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:14,334
I don't know. Sleep.

12
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:24,534
What are you gonna do today?

13
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:29,549
Nothing.

14
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:34,281
- I might visit Mackan in his office.
- Okay.

15
00:04:34,778 --> 00:04:39,756
Can you pick up a bottle of wine for
your parents tonight?

16
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:42,795
That's not necessary.
Dad has plenty.

17
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:46,642
Would you please do it, I don't want
to come empty handed again.

18
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,088
I feel embarrassed about it. Please?

19
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:52,524
- I'll fix it.
- Thanks.

20
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,532
I really need to go now.

21
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,391
Go, then.

22
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,443
Damn you're hot.

23
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:17,230
Now I really have to go.
I'm opening today.

24
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,981
Can't you check with the girls,
so they are free.

25
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:23,306
- What do you mean?
- This weekend.

26
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:25,333
Oh, of course.

27
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:29,273
Say hi to Mackan for me.

28
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:33,437
Don't forget the wine.

29
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,651
I checked up on the house
we talked about,

30
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:42,768
it seems like it's been abandoned
since forever.

31
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:45,717
- So I think you can walk straight in.
- Sounds great!

32
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:49,798
That's perfect. Now we have a place
to stay for the weekend.

33
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:52,563
But are you sure it's abandoned?

34
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,445
Yes, of course.
If you run into any problems you can

35
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,182
just forward them to me.

36
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:02,154
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- Of course we'll be careful, Eva.

37
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:06,441
If you get bored, Dad and I
might come over.

38
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,856
Anyone for a whisky, Albin?

39
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:12,141
No, I hate whisky.
You know that.

40
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,546
I can take a whisky.
A small one.

41
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:15,980
Alright, nice.

42
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:18,825
Mom, could I have another beer?

43
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:30,957
Have you made any other
plans for the summer?

44
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,660
We talked about going somewhere in
August, but that depends

45
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,392
on if I can get time off.

46
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,614
- I see.
- Thanks.

47
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,385
If you're not doing anything else, you
could always come out to the cabin.

48
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:47,191
Well, you can barbeque,
go fishing or help out dad.

49
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,591
It sounds nice, mom, we'll consider it.

50
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:53,906
Dad, what do we do about
the electricity?

51
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:57,218
- Elin? (A girl's name)
- Electricity. In the house.

52
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,512
Aha, I thought you said Elin.

53
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:05,944
That's not gonna be a problem. I can
power it up temporarily from work.

54
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,809
I work for all the power distribution
so that's not a problem.

55
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,009
How long has the house been abandoned,
do you know that?

56
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:14,394
- I don't know, five years, maybe.
- Is there still furniture?

57
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,928
Yes, absolutely.

58
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:19,864
I'll make a map for you.

59
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:23,240
There are some small, hard to find
roads, but it'll be alright.

60
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:24,771
Great.

61
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:29,124
Now let's make a toast.
To Elin. No, what am I saying?

62
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:33,288
- For Ida and Albin.
- Cheers!

63
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,378
Something like this.
What do you think?

64
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,590
Looks great.

65
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,036
- Bye.
- Bye.

66
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:46,646
Hi.

67
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:53,301
- God, you are sweaty.
- Sorry, I was at the gym with Marie.

68
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,761
- Did you talk about the weekend?
- Sorry, she can't come.

69
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:58,994
What?

70
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,705
Of course she's coming.

71
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,914
What a relief. I've been
looking forward to this.

72
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:06,905
Tove is coming too,
so we'll be four girls.

73
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,097
- That's perfect.
- So we can take my car.

74
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:12,240
Okay, so the guys take the
other car, perfect.

75
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,980
So, who's coming?

76
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:20,883
Albin and Markus of course.
And... I haven't talked to him.

77
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,635
But can you call and ask at least?

78
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:26,949
I think he's busy with his friends.
I don't think he wants to.

79
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:31,239
I don't want you to see him.
He's a player.

80
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,966
You can't say that,
you are siblings.

81
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:38,778
That's exactly why I know
what he's like.

82
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:42,863
Okay, but if I promise not to do
anything with him?

83
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,061
What kind of promise is that?

84
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,506
I don't want to, but okay,
I'll call him.

85
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:54,298
It's gonna be so much fun.
But tell him we are three

86
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:57,338
single girls that are coming.

87
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,211
Absolutely, I'll tell him that.

88
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,191
- I have a customer soon, so...
- Okay, I'm leaving. Later, kiss kiss.

89
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,756
- I'm so excited!
- Linnea, I have a surprise for you.

90
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:15,827
- What is it?
- You'll have to wait and see.

91
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,090
I'm so happy you could make it.
I don't know if I would want

92
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:19,571
to come along otherwise.

93
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:22,399
The asshole didn't want to give me
the weekend off at first.

94
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,216
So how did you manage?

95
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:27,258
I'm not going back anymore.

96
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:30,128
Marie, tonight you and I are
gonna go all in!

97
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,952
We're gonna get so wasted!

98
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,653
I have a good wine with me, Linnea.
You're gonna love the taste.

99
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:37,759
It's sweet and dry at the same time.

100
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:40,539
Okay. I've got liquor.

101
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:43,508
Marie, you should do wine reviews.

102
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,460
Sweet and dry at the same time.

103
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:49,183
- Linnea, stop, there is Simon.
- What, is he coming?

104
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,649
Yes, I told him you were coming.

105
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,765
Thanks for the heads up,
I haven't had time to fix myself up.

106
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:10,502
- Hi sis.
- Hi Simon.

107
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,827
- What's up?
- I'm fine, thanks.

108
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,093
This looks like a promising weekend.

109
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,681
Simon.

110
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,878
- Do I go with you?
- I don't think so.

111
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,551
But ask Albin if he can drive ahead,
we don't know where to go.

112
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:27,647
- Okay, I'll tell him. See you there.
- Bye, Simon.

113
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,013
- Hi, Simon.
- Hi.

114
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:38,727
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

115
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:39,955
- Good to see you.
- You too.

116
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:41,587
- This is Markus.
- Hi.

117
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:43,512
- Hi, Markus.
- Hi, Simon.

118
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:47,939
Have you... traded up?

119
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,926
- No, this is Olof's car.
- What happened to the Mazda?

120
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,017
I still have it.

121
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,934
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:57,461 --> 00:11:02,318
The girls asked us to drive first.
They didn't seem to know the way.

123
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:03,860
- Okay.
- Where are we going?

124
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:06,494
- It's a house that my dad found for us.
- Cool.

125
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:09,839
It looked promising in the other car.

126
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,294
That sure as shit wasn't three miles.

127
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:04,125
- Where are we?
- You're so impatient.

128
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,651
- Where are we?
- We just need to go straight in here.

129
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,120
Isn't he hot, Ida's brother?

130
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:24,091
Shall we?

131
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:30,761
Abbe, I have a feeling this
is gonna be so much fun.

132
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:31,552
Yeah, I know.

133
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,082
It sure was a long time since we
got together like this.

134
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:37,851
- Yeah, as long as Dad keeps his promise.
- You haven't seen the house?

135
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:41,359
No, I haven't. But it's cool,
he said it was fine.

136
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:57,196
- How are things with Ida?
- It's good. In fact, better than ever.

137
00:12:57,591 --> 00:13:02,502
I'll have to keep chasing girls myself.
C'mon, what happened to my wingman?

138
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,019
C'mon, I'm always on your side,
you know that.

139
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,018
You have lots to choose from this weekend.
I almost wish I were single.

140
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:09,966
Look, someone's standing over there.

141
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,995
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

142
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:30,173
Hi.

143
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,675
Do you want something?

144
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:45,002
Hey! I'm talking to you! Fucking idiot,
who the hell does he think he is?

145
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:49,738
Cut it, Simon, maybe he just doesn't want
to talk to you. Take it easy. Let's go.

146
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:57,277
- What was that about?
- Eh, forget it.

147
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:30,713
- Shit it's rundown.
- Three doors, that is something new.

148
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,561
All the doors are locked.

149
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,450
Albin, do you have a key?

150
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,245
No.

151
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:49,292
- How did you think we were gonna get in?
- He didn't think at all.

152
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,300
- I can try and lockpick the door.
- Can you do that?

153
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,661
I had a certain need for
that back in school.

154
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:05,580
So you have some gypsy in you after all,
I wouldn't have thought that.

155
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,866
Marie, over here.

156
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,205
Come.

157
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:06,016
- Can't we scare the shit out of Albin?
- Okay, but how?

158
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,262
Look, this window is open.

159
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,076
I'll help you get inside, then you can
open the front door from within.

160
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,814
- But I don't want to go in alone.
- C'mon, you can do it.

161
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:19,174
If you'll take my bag for me.

162
00:16:29,926 --> 00:16:33,941
- Markus, I can't see anything in here.
- Use your eyes.

163
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:42,689
"Use your eyes".

164
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:18,936
This is awesome.

165
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,204
Hello?

166
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,062
Who said I was the best?
Most handsome too, was that you?

167
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:26,528
- What, is it open?
- Oh, you're so talented, sweetheart.

168
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:32,504
- Let's not exaggerate here.
- Exactly, I would've kicked the door in.

169
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:36,128
That's great, Simon, then we can be
eaten by mosquitos all night.

170
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,324
Shall we go in?

171
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:45,188
- So this is what it looks like.
- Does it smell a little funny in here?

172
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,741
What a place.

173
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:58,240
- Imagine they just left it like this.
- Yeah, really.

174
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:05,526
Oh, my God.
Shit, you scared me.

175
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:09,507
- How the hell did you come in?
- You really startled me.

176
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:13,308
My idea. We got you good.

177
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:22,640
- Is there gonna be any action here tonight?
- For sure.

178
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:28,116
- Wanna check it out upstairs?
- Alright.

179
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:37,418
- My Dad did great, right?
- Absolutely.

180
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:40,198
It's been so long since we had a
whole weekend together.

181
00:21:40,472 --> 00:21:42,374
The girls really appreciate this.
And it's good for Tove

182
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:45,763
to get away from
all her problems for awhile.

183
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:50,303
- Where are we gonna sleep?
- We're not gonna need that.

184
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:51,969
We won't be sleeping.

185
00:21:55,257 --> 00:22:01,372
It's strange how you can be so different.
My parents would never do anything for us.

186
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:06,526
I guess. We didn't get to
choose our parents.

187
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:17,696
Wow. So this is where we're
supposed to sleep tonight?

188
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:24,442
Pink. That's really my color, isn't it?

189
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:33,222
- What are you thinking now?
- I don't know. What do you want?

190
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:56,177
We were suppose to scare Albin,
what happened?

191
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:00,606
I don't know.
I don't feel so well.

192
00:23:01,385 --> 00:23:05,237
Is it something serious?
C'mon, we're suppose to have a good time,

193
00:23:05,557 --> 00:23:07,383
you can't be sick now.

194
00:23:08,781 --> 00:23:12,900
I'm sure it'll pass.
I'm going inside.

195
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,325
Mackan, do you want your bag or not?

196
00:23:21,228 --> 00:23:23,733
I'm looking forward to a cold drink.

197
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:58,794
Guys, Linnea is here.
Screw Markus.

198
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,565
- You might need this.
- Thanks.

199
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,345
It feels really fun to be able to get
together for a weekend again like this,

200
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:07,554
it's been a long time.

201
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:11,485
I mean, Marie has been talking about moving
to Japan for like, five years now.

202
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:14,275
Now you're stuck with us instead.

203
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:18,853
- All jokes aside, cheers.
- Cheers for Marie.

204
00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:40,331
Tasty.

205
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,863
Marie, been drinking too much already?

206
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:51,732
I need to go to the bathroom.

207
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,538
Fuck, I feel horrible.

208
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,361
<i>Low battery level</i>

209
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:56,311
You scared me.

210
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:04,642
Could you move over, Marie?
C'mon, let's head down to the others.

211
00:29:07,593 --> 00:29:09,721
Hello, Marie?

212
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:13,342
C'mon, answer me.

213
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:51,005
- Albin, you have to help Linnea.
- What the hell happened?

214
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,618
What the fuck is happening?

215
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:05,933
Oh, fuck.

216
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,016
Albin, come here!

217
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:23,767
Get something to tie her with.
Sit still!

218
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,797
Tove, can you hear me?

219
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,936
Oh God, she spit on me.

220
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,879
I found this.

221
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,478
- How is it going?
- Not good. Her upper lip is torn off.

222
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,309
- She needs to go to a hospital.
- I have to help Simon, where is Markus?

223
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:17,819
I don't know, maybe he
went outside or something.

224
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:23,381
- Hit me. Hit me!
- Shut the fuck up.

225
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:27,307
Shut up before I knock your teeth out.

226
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:52,319
Oh, shit.

227
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:57,769
I have an idea!

228
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:00,417
- Abbe?
- Where the hell have you been?

229
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,126
- What the hell has happened?
- Stay away.

230
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:06,976
- Why is she tied up?
- She was totally insane before, okay?

231
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:13,029
- How did she become like this?
- She came down the stairs and attacked me.

232
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:16,046
Move over.

233
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,278
Have you seen her eyes?

234
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:23,470
What happened to you?

235
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:26,559
Did she get rabies?

236
00:32:26,882 --> 00:32:29,627
Rabies? Do you think you become
like this from rabies?!

237
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:36,971
- Has she been drugged?
- Have you even tried drugs?

238
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:44,987
- Don't fucking open the door.
- Mackan, in the kitchen, now.

239
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,393
Close the side door and stand behind me.

240
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:52,771
- Stay behind me now.
- Give me the towel.

241
00:32:57,588 --> 00:32:59,868
Keep quiet both of you, I'll handle this.

242
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:07,874
Hey.

243
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:16,102
Hello there.
Is everything alright in there?

244
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,813
Yes, why wouldn't it be?

245
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:21,763
I need you to let me in.

246
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:24,128
Why?

247
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:28,302
I want to have a look at your friend.

248
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:31,041
Who the hell are you?

249
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:35,150
- Have you been spying on us?
- Wait inside.

250
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:42,818
Let's put it this way, I was nearby and
you people aren't exactly quiet.

251
00:33:43,008 --> 00:33:44,330
Let me in now.

252
00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:49,051
Look, I don't know who you are,
and you're standing here with a rifle.

253
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:51,099
I want you to leave now.

254
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:56,109
- That's enough, let me in.
- Okay, just take it easy.

255
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,167
Where is she?

256
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,884
Behind the door.

257
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:38,999
Hello, can you hear me?

258
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:51,493
- This girl is dead.
- Are you out of your mind?

259
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,832
She's sitting there, damn it.

260
00:34:54,118 --> 00:35:00,519
She has been turned into something else.
It's too late, you have to get rid of her.

261
00:35:03,682 --> 00:35:10,139
Let's take it easy. If you know something
about this, you need to tell us right now.

262
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:18,216
Back up! I said back up.
Stand over there, let's go.

263
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:28,519
- What are you doing?
- Listen to me now very carefully...

264
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:36,429
A couples of days ago, me, my wife and
daughter were out here in the woods.

265
00:35:37,556 --> 00:35:40,978
Keep in touch when you're getting
ready so we can meet up here again.

266
00:35:41,218 --> 00:35:43,368
Of course. But are you sure
this is alright with you?

267
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:47,277
Yes, I'm sure. You get the fish
and we'll get the chanterelles.

268
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:48,669
Okay.

269
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:56,206
We parted there. I went fishing and
Karin and Lisa went to pick mushrooms.

270
00:35:56,664 --> 00:36:00,023
About chanterelles, you know it's those
yellow things, right?

271
00:36:00,263 --> 00:36:02,374
Yes, dad, I know that.

272
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,069
- Alright, good luck now.
- Take care.

273
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:10,399
And then they found this fucking house.

274
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,779
I don't know what happened,
but it was something.

275
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:21,702
Her eyes, I can't describe it,
but... it wasn't her.

276
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,945
What exactly do you think you know?

277
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:29,088
Okay...

278
00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:32,237
My grandfather told me a story
when I was a little kid.

279
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:38,069
About a legend that was about creatures
that lived beneath the ground.

280
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:45,983
I was told that if you trespassed on their lands,
things could go very bad.

281
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:54,997
If you saw one of these creature,
you should turn and run as fast as you could.

282
00:36:57,773 --> 00:37:06,125
They were so powerful if you gazed into
their eyes, they would take your soul.

283
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:16,163
- Wait up, old man, is this your theory?
- That's exactly what I mean.

284
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:21,245
- And that is what has happened in here.
- What happened to your family?

285
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:24,684
They didn't make it.

286
00:37:25,797 --> 00:37:29,379
Just before Lisa...

287
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:33,802
She whispered to me...

288
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:44,351
Mom and I found a house. We went in.
We found a basement. Help me Dad...

289
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:54,372
I think your girl suffered the same fate
that my grandfather told me about...

290
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:58,629
Like my wife and Lisa suffered...

291
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:05,765
- So you're saying Marie has...
- Listen to me now.

292
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:14,265
This girl is dead. Something has taken her
body. What happens here is dangerous.

293
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:18,152
You have to call the police.
But the most important thing is...

294
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:20,872
We get rid of her.

295
00:38:21,324 --> 00:38:24,888
You don't touch Marie,
we have to take her to a hospital.

296
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:27,630
A doctor can't do anything about this.

297
00:38:29,497 --> 00:38:33,293
Have anyone been in contact with her
since she changed into this?

298
00:38:34,336 --> 00:38:36,863
We've all been near her, why?

299
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:40,162
I don't understand what you mean.

300
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:45,230
I mean, if anyone has gotten any blood on
themselves, or has been scratched or bitten?

301
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:48,349
What has that got to do with anything?

302
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:54,310
Once you've been exposed, it spreads easily.

303
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,207
We have to get rid of her.

304
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:02,476
Preferably, burn her.

305
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:06,928
Of course we're not gonna do that.
I have to call an ambulance.

306
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,365
Shoot her!

307
00:42:16,591 --> 00:42:18,347
Stay back.

308
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:34,250
- Are you okay?
- What happened, where is Tove?

309
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:36,842
She went completely crazy and attacked me.
She jumped out the window.

310
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:38,908
This can't be fucking happening.

311
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,216
- Where are you going?
- Ida, come now, we're leaving.

312
00:42:42,504 --> 00:42:44,360
Simon, wait.
I have to call the police.

313
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:46,548
Come on.

314
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:50,780
Simon, if we're getting out of here,
everyone needs to come along.

315
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,938
I don't give a shit about
the others, okay?

316
00:42:54,026 --> 00:42:56,444
Do as I say for once and get going.

317
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,638
We need help, I don't know exactly
what's going on but...

318
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:05,620
- You don't have a choice, okay?
- Simon, release her.

319
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,373
Excuse me,
you want something?

320
00:43:07,656 --> 00:43:11,032
You heard me, it's not up to you
to decide what Ida should do.

321
00:43:11,518 --> 00:43:13,624
I talked to the police and they told
me that someone has to go

322
00:43:13,863 --> 00:43:17,140
- and meet them by the cars.
- Fine. I guess I'm going.

323
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:19,707
Stay here and fucking rot.

324
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:22,049
I'll go with you.

325
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:24,624
Yeah, that's gonna be fun.

326
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:27,539
You're the last person on
earth I want with me.

327
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:29,993
I'll go.

328
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:32,058
No, you're gonna stay here.

329
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:37,052
It's okay. It's better if we are two,
it's gonna be fine.

330
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,941
Let's go.

331
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:46,228
Sweetheart, it's gonna be okay,
I promise. Be careful now.

332
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,969
Yes, Daddy.

333
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:52,455
- Hello? Are you still there?
- Hello?

334
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,433
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

335
00:43:54,691 --> 00:43:57,973
- What did you decide?
- Two guys are meeting you by our cars.

336
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,325
Where are you going?

337
00:44:06,806 --> 00:44:08,457
I'm just gonna check something out.

338
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,690
Do you really have to?

339
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,963
Just over here.

340
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,631
Keep close to me.

341
00:44:36,148 --> 00:44:38,788
- Here, take this.
- What am I suppose to do with it?

342
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:40,812
You never know.

343
00:44:50,636 --> 00:44:52,527
I'll take this.

344
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:55,098
What is this?

345
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,011
No, are those birds? Oh, shit.

346
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:19,296
Have they eaten each other?

347
00:45:20,742 --> 00:45:22,606
Let's go.

348
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,333
I'm coming.

349
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:12,739
Motherfucking idiot.

350
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:16,157
Now you son of a bitch.

351
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:26,931
Hold that rifle for me.

352
00:49:32,254 --> 00:49:35,388
Fucking shit, hell.

353
00:51:10,128 --> 00:51:12,025
Wait up, Simon,
I can't keep up with you.

354
00:51:12,222 --> 00:51:13,848
We can't stop now, come on.

355
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:17,102
I can't see anything when you're
walking ahead with the flashlight.

356
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:23,137
There are fucking stones everywhere.

357
00:51:25,393 --> 00:51:27,529
Okay, come here.
Let's stick together.

358
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:36,340
This is probably the wrong
time to ask but...

359
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:38,559
What?

360
00:51:39,706 --> 00:51:41,606
Wait a second.

361
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:45,762
What's the matter?

362
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,285
It's not very good.

363
00:51:53,002 --> 00:51:55,683
I know you feel a bit shocked because
of everything that has happened.

364
00:51:56,107 --> 00:51:59,395
Marie and Tove,
I barely know them but...

365
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:05,043
I feel a bit down myself.

366
00:52:07,025 --> 00:52:09,254
It's gonna be alright.

367
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:12,336
We're on our way to the police now.

368
00:52:13,357 --> 00:52:16,025
It didn't turn out the way we planned.

369
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:24,081
- Oh, shit, stay there.
- What is it?

370
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:26,220
Don't come any fucking closer.

371
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,126
I said stay there.

372
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,024
- Simon, what's wrong?
- I go, you stay.

373
00:52:32,555 --> 00:52:34,602
Are you insane?
You can't just leave me here.

374
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,267
What the fuck.

375
00:52:43,642 --> 00:52:45,683
I told you to stay away.

376
00:54:24,734 --> 00:54:28,725
I don't feel so good.
I have to lie down.

377
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:33,798
Do you want something to drink?

378
00:54:50,781 --> 00:54:54,043
- I'm screwed, right?
- Mackan, drink this.

379
00:55:00,325 --> 00:55:03,163
Mackan, listen to me now. The police
are gonna be here soon.

380
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:05,551
Everything's gonna be alright.

381
00:55:06,494 --> 00:55:10,290
- Mackan, it's gonna be alright.
- Why the hell are you still here?

382
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:14,350
Listen, the police are
gonna be here soon.

383
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:26,130
- Marie is gone.
- What do you mean, gone?

384
00:55:36,617 --> 00:55:38,630
Markus, you need to get up now.

385
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:47,246
Damn, I'm bleeding.

386
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:54,744
- Was that Marie?
- I don't know.

387
00:56:10,696 --> 00:56:12,403
What do we do?

388
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,270
Wait.

389
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:35,733
Ida, stay there now.

390
00:57:49,085 --> 00:57:52,262
Albin, you fucking cunt,
get over here!

391
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,128
No!

392
01:01:15,301 --> 01:01:17,311
Honey, look at me.

393
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:21,647
We got to go now, we can't wait
any longer. Where is your phone?

394
01:01:22,806 --> 01:01:25,367
On the sofa, I think.

395
01:01:34,753 --> 01:01:37,639
- Okay, let's go.
- Weren't we suppose to wait?

396
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:40,824
No, we need to get out of here, we
need to go through the woods.

397
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:49,898
Albin, get up.
We have to go now.

398
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:59,781
Fuck, this isn't gonna work.
Get inside again.

399
01:04:23,656 --> 01:04:25,726
Ida!

400
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:40,809
Ida. Where are you?

401
01:04:56,423 --> 01:05:00,093
Ida. Open the door.

402
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:06,872
- Open the door.
- Simon, are the police with you?

403
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,861
Where is Linnea?

404
01:05:16,582 --> 01:05:18,161
I said, open it!

405
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,459
Open it!

406
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:31,879
Fuck.

407
01:05:37,194 --> 01:05:38,456
Come on, fucker!

408
01:05:39,866 --> 01:05:40,866
Come on!

409
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:44,202
Forgive me, Linnea.

410
01:06:44,816 --> 01:06:47,970
I didn't know what I was doing.

411
01:06:48,999 --> 01:06:51,154
Please, don't do it.

412
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,006
Please!

413
01:06:54,214 --> 01:06:56,191
No, Linnea, Please.

414
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:06,016
He's still outside.
I think it's Markus.

415
01:07:44,446 --> 01:07:46,435
It's too high up,
we're gonna break our necks.

416
01:07:47,415 --> 01:07:49,254
We need to get out,
It's our only chance.

417
01:07:49,378 --> 01:07:52,887
How? We're never gonna
get out of here.

418
01:08:20,383 --> 01:08:22,938
Okay, honey, let's do like this.

419
01:08:24,421 --> 01:08:26,242
We can't wait for the police anymore.

420
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,575
I'm gonna loosen the ropes now.

421
01:08:29,224 --> 01:08:31,394
If Markus is outside
I'm gonna hit him immediately.

422
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,898
Stay right behind me and don't do
anything before I say so.

423
01:08:35,099 --> 01:08:36,706
- Okay.
- Okay.

424
01:09:06,645 --> 01:09:07,177
Okay.

425
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:12,295
We're not gonna see shit in the woods, but
we'll get through this. Are you ready?

426
01:09:18,778 --> 01:09:20,638
Okay, let's do it.

427
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:48,476
Ida, down.
Go down the stairs.

428
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:00,348
Linnea?

429
01:10:05,552 --> 01:10:08,374
Ida, get up again.
Get up!

430
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:21,816
Try to find another way out!

431
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:06,795
Up! Up!

432
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,671
Ida, fuck that, Ida!

433
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:09,798
Ida!

434
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,365
Albin!

435
01:14:18,983 --> 01:14:22,530
We need to go. We need to go.

436
01:14:23,788 --> 01:14:26,491
- I'll be right behind you.
- I can't do it.

437
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,656
I'll be right there. Hurry!

438
01:16:01,109 --> 01:16:03,907
Simon. Simon!

439
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,673
Simon, come here!

440
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:05,458
Ida!

441
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,082
Ida. Ida!

442
01:21:54,365 --> 01:21:56,298
Ida. Honey.

443
01:21:58,075 --> 01:22:03,409
Can you hear me?
Say something.

444
01:22:53,078 --> 01:22:55,920
Fuck!

445
01:23:12,171 --> 01:23:15,011
Fuck!

446
01:24:41,668 --> 01:24:46,684
Albin. Albin.

447
01:24:56,208 --> 01:24:58,195
Honey?

448
01:26:40,827 --> 01:26:43,223
Fuck! Fuck!

449
01:30:14,663 --> 01:30:16,633
No, no, no!

450
01:32:59,056 --> 01:33:01,326
Die!
