Dead.

It's okay. I'm a cop.

9

Both.

14
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,814
They're going back and forth.
It's getting kind of loud.

15
00:01:17,882 --> 00:01:19,516

I drop my keys.

00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,189
Yeah.

Your mother killed Christmas.

She killed it dead, Clyde.

25
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,647
Every year, it's the same.

26
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:52,149
"You're coming to
Pittsburgh, right?

27
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:54,584
I don't want to be
alone for the holiday."

28
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:56,019
Well, she is alone.

29
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:57,954
In-laws.

30
00:01:58,022 --> 00:02:00,390
Even when they're not
in the same time zone,

31
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,592
they can ruin your day.

32
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,194
Yes, in-laws are a
universal problem.

33
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:06,029
But one of the
benefits of group

34
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:08,231
is that we all get to
share our experiences.

35
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:09,633
Does anyone
have anything?

36
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,234
Change your phone number.

37
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:13,270
Or move, don't tell
them where you went.

38
00:02:13,338 --> 00:02:14,805
Wes, you disagree?

39
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:16,206
Hmm?

40
00:02:16,274 --> 00:02:18,842

Clyde, Rozelle, look.

42
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:24,681
When I was married to Alex,
my mother was a problem.

43
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:26,950
Didn't get better until I
confronted her about it.

44
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:28,819
And that's what you got
to do here, Clyde.

45
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,620
It's got to be you;
otherwise, Rozelle

46
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:32,856
is just the harpy who stole
her son away from her.

47
00:02:32,924 --> 00:02:34,491
That's what I keep telling him.

48
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:36,293
Call her up. Say, "Mom,

49
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,861
"I'm the decider now.

50
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:39,162
"You don't pay
my bills anymore.

51
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,497
"You don't clothe
me anymore.

52
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:41,832
"I make my own choices.

53
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,367
That's the way it is."

54
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:45,869
She does help us with money.

55
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:50,173
Wes, how did that
strategy work for you?

56
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:52,609
Great. There's a beautiful
relationship there now.

57
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,313
Between my mother and Alex.

58
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,981
Neither of 'em

59
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:59,616
really got over me
quitting the law.

60
00:02:59,684 --> 00:03:01,151
And, uh,

61
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,120
my mom and I e-mail
occasionally.

62
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:05,188
It's... cordial.

63
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:07,190
Yeah.

64
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:08,859
Sorry, Dr. Ryan.
I got a text message

65
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:10,827
from my old boss.

66
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:12,329
Dan Noone?

67
00:03:12,397 --> 00:03:13,797
What's he want,
a designated driver?

68
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,265
It's not funny.

69
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,200
We-we got to go.
Excuse me. Sorry.

70
00:03:36,754 --> 00:03:38,054
You know you're lucky, right?
Yeah?

71
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,956
You get to watch a legend
at work.

72
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:41,525
Yeah, I heard
the stories.

73
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:44,728
Now you get to live
the Dan Noone experience.

74
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:47,164
He made me the finely-tuned
investigative machine that I am.

75
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,466
Yeah? Well, in that
case, I am lucky.

76
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:51,011
Got a few things
I want to say to him.

77
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,202
Nooner!

78
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:55,105
Hey, T!

79
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:57,374
How they hangin', jefe?
Ah, they're headin'

80
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:58,809
for the knees,
and I wish to Christ

81
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:00,710

Wes Mitchell.

83

How are yours hangin'?

85

They're hang...
Just... I can't.

86
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:08,652
Nah.

87
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,120
So, what happened?

88
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:11,721
It's a mess.

89
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:14,224
We had an informant
inside of Los Ladrones.

90
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,792
You know, the
Guatemalan outfit

91
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,360
that holds down all the
corners in Glassell Park?

92
00:04:17,428 --> 00:04:19,930
Our guy said he was
making a wholesale buy

93
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:21,665
first thing this morning,
so we set up surveillance

94
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:23,900
about a block away, and soon
as we got audio, well...

95
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:26,770
all hell broke loose, and the
rest you can see for yourself.

96
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:29,372
We got four bodies, and
one of 'em's my snitch.

97
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,308
I guess someone wanted those
corners for themselves, huh?

98
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,843
Looks like it.

99
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,544
We'll get a description
of the shooters

100
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:36,213
as soon
as my witness stops puking.

101
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,148
So, you have a witness?

102
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,683
How's he doing?

103
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,117
Still going,
last I checked.

104
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:43,053
I don't know how
he got anything left.

105
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:46,523
How long has he been
in there?

106
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:47,891
15, maybe 20.

107
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,326
What's his name?

108
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:50,694
Charlie Perez.

109
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:52,996
Mr. Perez, open up.

Fallen soldiers, son.
Fallen soldiers.

149
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,487
This is Snowy Two.

150
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:50,023
Our runner

151
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,025
introduced himself
as Charlie,

152
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:55,161

mean that his name is Charles.

153
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:56,763
The man that
we're looking for

154
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,432
is Carlos Perez.

155
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,401
Here is his photo.

156
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,403
That's him. That's our guy.

157
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,671
I just said that.

158
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,406
Now, Carlos

160
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:09,676
under Charles Perez

161
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:11,844
because he's a two-time felon.

162
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:13,813
Grand larceny and possession
of stolen property.

163
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:17,183
All right, so, an ex-con
is there for a drug deal

164
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:18,751
that becomes a massacre.

165
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,253
He then flees the scene.

166
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:21,721
Anybody thinking

167
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,089
what I'm thinking?

168
00:07:23,157 --> 00:07:24,891
Yeah. He might not be a witness.

169
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,659

for a shooter.

170
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,896

Yeah. What's up, Nooner?

174
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,608
Listen, this whole thing's
getting ugly.

175
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:45,478
I mean, I got a dead informant,
I let this Perez guy slip

176
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:47,413

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

operation.

00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:53,086
You got to take risks.

180
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,088
You taught me that.

181
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:56,489
Yeah, I did. I did.

182
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:58,358
You see, we got this new major.

183
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,560
It's a 35-year-old chick.

184
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,262
She keeps telling me the era
of the cowboy cop is over.

185
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,898
I know this is your case,

186
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:07,734
but, you see, my boss--

187
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:10,903
she's just itching
to find a reason to suspend me.

188
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:15,775
If somebody else makes
the collar,

189
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,510
well, she's gonna have
a reason.

190
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,812
You want to put cuffs
on the shooter, I got your back.

191
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,314
You'd do that?
Yeah.

192
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:24,217
I'll be there for you any time,

193
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:26,619
any place, any way. Uh...

194
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:29,455
Stay ready.
So you don't have to get ready.

195
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,600
Hi.

196
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,468
I'm Travis Marks.

197
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,641
This crime scene hasn't been
adequately photographed.

198
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:55,181
Well, we'll, uh...
we'll be sure

199
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:56,816
to send the techs
a harshly-worded e-mail.

200
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,618
First principles, son.

201
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:01,521
If your techs can't
process a crime scene

202
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:03,856
thoroughly, then,
the entire investigation

203
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:05,625
is nothing but a leaky boat.

204
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:21,140
Your old boss
is a freak show.

205
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,542
Snowy Two?

206
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,610
He does know

207
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:28,748
it's weird to name your new dog
after your old dead one, right?

208
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:31,250
Look, Fred Bandak has a long
and distinguished career.

209
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:33,252
He's entitled to
a few... quirks.

210
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,720
Yeah. Whatever.
This is our case.

211
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:37,190
Can we ditch him now
and go get some work done?

212
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:38,658
Be patient.

213
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,526
Hey, Fred?

214
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:42,628
Don't, don't. Don't.

215
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:44,697
Uh, hey, Fred, is there
anything we can do,

216
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:46,199
help save some time?

217
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,234
Good investigation takes
as long as it takes.

218
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:49,769
You know that.

219
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:53,239
Yes, sir.

220
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:56,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's onto something.

221
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,311
He's onto something.

222
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,379
Okay, okay.

223
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:02,081
Okay. Now, watch this.

224
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:08,087
What are you doing now, Fred?

225
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:09,889
I'm waiting, son.

226
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,291
Waiting for the truth.

227
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,460
Okay. Okay, that's
an expression.

228
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,863
He analyzes everything, doesn't
want to jump to any conclusions.

229
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,331
He's smart.

230
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:20,233
Let me ask you something.
Does he frighten you?

231
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,034
No.

232
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:23,603
No. Why would he frighten me?

233
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,972
He is the Ghost
of Future Wes.

234
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,108
If I were you, I'd be terrified
of winding up like...

235
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:31,410
that.

236
00:10:31,478 --> 00:10:35,515
My guy doesn't lose witnesses.

237
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:37,350
Or suspects, or whatever
you call Charlie Perez.

238
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,018
No, no.

239
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:42,054
He just carries a dog around
like a man-purse.

240
00:10:42,122 --> 00:10:43,589
Hey, Fred?

241
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,124
No, no, no, don't.

242
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,492
No, I'll be sweet.
I'll be sweet.

243
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,860
Listen, man,
uh, quick question.

244
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:50,863
Um, while you're waiting,

245
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:54,567
do you mind if we just go ahead
and, um, investigate?

246
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:57,904
If you can't refrain from
talking, I'd actually prefer it.

247
00:10:57,971 --> 00:10:59,539
Okay, sorry, Fred.

248
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:00,706
Got it.

249
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:02,708
Got Fred mad at us.

250
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:04,277
Don't have to get
all snooty at me.

251
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:05,545
I mean, I'm just
asking a question.

252
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,783
<i>Got the address on Perez.</i>

253
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:12,351
Keep it locked and loaded, team.

254
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,187
Thanks, Noone.

255
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,067
Wait.

256
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:30,870
Should we wait for the truth
or knock on the door?

257
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:32,371
I don't know. What
would Dan Noone do?

258
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,006
Oh, wait, I do know.
Let's have a drink

259
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:36,175
and talk about it while
the suspect escapes.

260
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:37,210
LAPD! Open up!

261
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:40,379
Ready?

262
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:41,347
Yeah.

263
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:00,833
LAPD!

264
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:02,001
Behind the table,
come up.

265
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:03,236
Hands up right now.

266
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:04,537
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

267
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:05,705
Don't shoot!
Okay, okay, relax.

268
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,473
No one's gonna shoot,
all right?

269
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,941
Are you really police?

270
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,977
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:13,012
My husband said men might be
coming here to hurt us.

272
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,146
We were just about to leave.

273
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:15,281
Is your husband Carlos Perez?

274
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,283
Is he in the house?

275
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,317
Where is he?!

276
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:20,152
I don't know!

277
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,654
He came here an hour ago.

278
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:23,522
He said he was
in big, big trouble.

279
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,626
He gave us this,
then he said we had to run.

280
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:29,362
Charlie got away with some money
from the crime scene.

281
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,130
I warned him

282
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,266
not to get involved
with those people.

283
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,267
What people?

284
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:41,440
Ma'am, if your husband's
in danger,

285
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:43,743
we're your best shot
at keeping him safe.

286
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:51,317
Charlie wanted to start
his limousine company,

287
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:55,354
but he couldn't get a loan or a
license, 'cause he's an ex-con.

288
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,057
Changed his name to get around
the licensing thing,

289
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,793
then he went to them
for the loan.

290
00:13:00,861 --> 00:13:02,261
Saavedra people.

291
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,096
The cartel?

292
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:06,232
Everyone around here knows,
if you want to borrow money

293
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,302
till payday, you go see
Miguel Avila at Safari Car Wash.

294
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:12,805
I knew something
like this would happen.

295
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:14,240
Something like what?

296
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:16,309
He said they made him
do something.

297
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:19,312
Okay.

298
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,915
We'll go to the car wash,
meet with this Miguel Avila,

299
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:25,151
see if he can tell us
where your husband might be.

300
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,520
In the meantime,
an officer's gonna come by here,

301
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,456
he'll take you and
your daughter to a hotel, okay?

302
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,725
You hear from Charlie,
you call us.

303
00:13:34,895 --> 00:13:35,828
Thank you.

304
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:50,109
Okay, so this guy Perez
takes cartel money,

305
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:52,812
he starts a business,
so now he owes them a marker.

306
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,314
Looks like they called
it in last night.

307
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,683
But if Perez is the one who
mowed down the four guys

308
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:00,686
from Los Ladrones, why does he
think the cartel's after him?

309
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:02,088
He did what
they wanted.

310
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:03,122
I don't know.

311
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:08,694
Those guys don't look like
car wash employees to me.

312
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:12,498
Stay on your toes.

313
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:19,905
Hello?

314
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,308
Hello?

315
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:25,244
Detective.

316
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,053
LAPD. Stay
right there.

317
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:36,288
Go!

318
00:14:36,356 --> 00:14:38,424
LAPD!

319
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,993
Open up right now!

320
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:42,762
Travis, get down!

321
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:46,599
You all right?

322
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,566
Yeah.

323
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:48,567
On three, yeah?

324
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,503
Yeah. One, two, three.

325
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:54,540
He's going, he's going!

326
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:59,412
♪

327
00:15:31,778 --> 00:15:32,912
Get in the car!

328
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:05,878
LAPD.

329
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:07,580
Put them down.
Drop the guns now!

330
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,014
Right now!
Drop them now, now!

331
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:10,015
Put the guns down!

332
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,150
Cops right here!

333
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:12,751
Hey, this is a misunderstanding!

334
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:14,086
Get on the ground now!
Get down!

335
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:15,354
A misunderstand.

336
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,789
They're my bodyguards.

337
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:17,990
They thought you were
gonna hurt me.

338
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:19,358
Miguel Avila?

339
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:20,659
Yeah.

340
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,294
You and your bodyguards
are under arrest.

341
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:27,338
I don't know anything
about a drug deal.

342
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,073
I told you, I'm a
legitimate businessman.

343
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:32,143
Oh, a legitimate businessman
whose employees carry Mac-10s?

344
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,245
Hey, it's a dangerous
neighborhood.

345
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,381
I only called
my bodyguards in

346
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:39,050
after that maniac bursted into
my office and attacked me.

347
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:40,885
Wait, are you telling us that
Carlos Perez threatened you?

348
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:42,553
Yeah. I lent
him money.

349
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:44,656
Something I do for
people in the community.

350
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:47,592
Well, your philanthropy
is very impressive, Miguel.

351
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,128
Look, Charlie always
paid on time, no problem.

352
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:51,462
But today, he
went crazy.

353
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,830
He attacked me.

354
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:55,133
He said that if I
hurt his family,

355
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,336
he would do the same to
my wife and my daughter.

356
00:16:58,404 --> 00:17:00,605
Now, why would I
hurt his family?

357
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,107
Because your business is a front
for the Saavedra cartel, Miguel.

358
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,209
Because, no matter what happened
in that parking garage,

359
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:06,878
you know Carlos Perez
left with

360
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:08,346
a stack load
of your boss's money.

361
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:09,914
My boss.

362
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:10,948
I'm a legitimate...
Legitimate businessman.

363
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:11,949
Yeah, we heard you

364
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:13,551
the last ten times you said it.

365
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,086
Now you can tell
the booking officer

366
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:16,120
down at the station.

367
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:18,489
Oh, come on.

368
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:20,425
All right,
I got a text from Fred.

369
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:23,261
"Dear Wesley,

370
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:25,263
"I do loathe
these digital leashes,

371
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,031
"but they have their uses.

372
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,033
"Please come down to the
station when you have a chance.

373
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:29,901
Sincerely yours,
Fred Bandak."

374
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:36,374
He knows this is
not his case, right?

375
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:38,309
Well, I did... ask
him for a consult.

376
00:17:38,377 --> 00:17:40,708
Which he gave to you.

377
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:41,713
Now it's time to take
Snowy 2 for a walk,

378
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:43,381
and get the hell
out of our business.

379
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:45,149
It'll be fine.
He's just excited

380
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:47,685
to be out in the field, all right?
Whatever.

381
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:50,021
Who signs a text message?

382
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:57,128
<i>So, I analyzed</i>

383
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:58,796
every aspect of this melee--

384
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,765
lines of fire,
avenues of escape--

385
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,800
and after four and a half hours,

386
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:05,203
I got it all
right here in my head.

387
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,638
And this is what I found.

388
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:09,373
Spot of blood

389
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:10,808
on one of the tires

390
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,577
of the limousine.

391
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:14,378
Your techs missed it.

392
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:17,215
You found a spot of blood
at a massacre. Congratulations.

393
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,050
What's he even doing here?

394
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:20,952
He's not on this case.

395
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:22,487
Well, this isn't your case,
either, Dan.

396
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:24,021
You're still here.

397
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:25,723
It says the spot of
blood doesn't match

398
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,291
any of the dead bodies.

399
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,060
Doesn't match
Charlie Perez, either.

400
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:30,828
Which means there was
someone else at that scene.

401
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:31,829
Exactly.

402
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:33,297
Someone else who got away.

403
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:34,732
Took the DNA
and did a search

404
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,267
of the VICAP database.

405
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:38,503
We found a partial match
with a degraded sample

406
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,005
at a crime scene
of the Cabo San Lucas massacre

407
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:43,307
in Mexico.

408
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,977
13 top lieutenants
of the Escamilla cartel

409
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,579
dead on a beach
at a resort.

410
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:50,248
Now, Escamilla's people
say that they think

411
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:52,617
that this is the work
of a Saavedra assassin

412
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:55,419
they call "El Ingeniero."

413
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:56,854
El Ingeniero.

414
00:18:56,922 --> 00:18:58,289
Yeah, I've heard that before.

415
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:59,657
Of course you
heard about it--

416
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:00,691
'cause I told
you about 'em.

417
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:01,692
I'm in Narcotics.

418
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,994
I know about 'em.

419
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,829
El Ingeniero is "The Engineer."

420
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,964
He's a fairy tale.

421
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:08,666
Story that cartel goons
talk about

422
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:11,035
and sit around and tell
each other when they're bored.

423
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:12,904
Yeah? Well, I believe he's real,

424
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:14,438
that he's in L.A.,

425
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,873
that he's the gunman
that we're looking for.

426
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,508
Carlos Perez
is the gunman,

427
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:19,710
who's a real person
we can place at the scene.

428
00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:22,380
Come on, T, tell him you're
not going on some snipe hunt.

429
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:25,316
Tell him you're not gonna ignore
an essential piece of forensic data.

430
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:26,818
Guys, guys,

431
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,920
let's just relax, all right?
Doesn't have

432
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:31,022
to be one or the other.
Uh...

433
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:34,158
Charles Perez's cousin
drives the other limo

434
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:35,693
for the service, right?

435
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:37,528
So if Charlie is looking
to skip town,

436
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,430
he's probably gonna get
in touch with him.

437
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:40,865
We could squat on the cousin,

438
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,433
maybe get a wiretap
on his phones.

439
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,869
Yeah. And while we check up
on Fred's lead,

440
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:47,038
we'll wait and see
if Carlos gets in touch

441
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:48,272
with his cousin, okay?

442
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,615
Hey, guys,
there is no boogie man.

443
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:05,890
You know, it'd really be
nice to work this case

444
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,160
without your greedy, needy
ex-boss in my ear.

445
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:11,162
I can absolutely relate
to how you feel.

446
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,538
Evening, sir.

447
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:22,206
Ah.
You okay?

448
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:25,376
Yeah, yeah, I'm just, uh,
giving Snowy a little exercise.

449
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:28,946
Okay, uh...

450
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:30,948
well, have a good night.
Uh, Wes?

451
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:32,683
I just wanted to thank you

452
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:34,785
for letting me saddle up
with you again.

453
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:38,923
This is gonna be one
of my last times at the rodeo.

454
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:40,391
What do you mean?

455
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,727
You haven't heard?

456
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:46,697
Missing Persons is being
consolidated out of existence.

457
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:49,800
All duties to be absorbed
by the other departments.

458
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:51,535
I'm being forced
to retire, buddy.

459
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:53,604
What?
Yeah.

460
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,008
Well, why don't
you just transfer?

461
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,711
No one wants me.

462
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:03,414
Look, you spend
your career

463
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,289
upholding the standards
of conduct, you're not gonna

464
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:08,227
wind up with many friends.

465
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,455
I'm sorry, sir.

466
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:13,324
That's all right.
It's life.

467
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:15,726
I'm not gonna whine about it.

468
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:19,497
Of course, if I <i>were</i>
to catch El Ingeniero,

469
00:21:19,564 --> 00:21:21,966
that'd bring a lot
of headlines our way,

470
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:23,334
wouldn't it?
Yeah.

471
00:21:23,402 --> 00:21:26,103
Yeah. A-And it'd
keep the lights on

472
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,005
for a few more years.
Yeah.

473
00:21:28,073 --> 00:21:29,206
Yeah.

474
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:31,208
Well, let me see what I can do.

475
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,576
Hey, it's your theory, Fred.

476
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:34,245
You should get the collar.

477
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:37,148
All right.

478
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,284
Sir.

479
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:49,327
Snowy.

480
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,162
Come on!

481
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:05,576
So, you promised the arrest
to your old boss.

482
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:07,678
Correct.

483
00:22:07,746 --> 00:22:09,814
And <i>you</i> promised the arrest
to <i>your</i> old boss.

484
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:12,149
He needs it.
I owe him.

485
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:14,485
Yeah, I did.
Look, Dan Noone may need the arrest,

486
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,454
but he doesn't deserve it--
we'd have our perp

487
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:18,356
in custody right now
if he hadn't blown it.

488
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:20,091
Like your guy's any better?

489
00:22:20,158 --> 00:22:21,726
Yes.
He arrives uninvited,

490
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:23,961
he craps on everyone's work,
he hijacks the investigation

491
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:26,297
to go hunt for a ghost--
with his <i>mind.</i>

492
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:29,033
Well, at least his mind
isn't pickled,

493
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:30,735
like Dan's.

494
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:33,170
If Fred did more doing
and less thinking...

495
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:36,674
What? He'd live in the past,
have a record like Dan's?

496
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:39,491
Come on, man, you got
to look back at his career--

497
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:40,478
he's done more good than harm.

498
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,846
It's-it's not even close.
Oh. Oh, oh,

499
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:43,714
so we have to weigh
his whole career now.

500
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:49,587
Guys, it's interesting--
what you're dealing with

501
00:22:49,654 --> 00:22:52,289
Please. All
due respect,

502
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:54,158
this is nothing like an argument over
whose in-law's house

503
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:55,626
we're going to
for Christmas.

504
00:22:55,694 --> 00:22:57,061
Yeah.
Yeah, we're talking

505
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:58,829
about dead bodies,
drugs, stolen money.

506
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:00,965
All right, put the
particulars aside,

507
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:03,200
you're talking about
two parental surrogates,

508
00:23:03,268 --> 00:23:05,369
important figures
in your professional lives,

509
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:08,305
both of whom are demanding
your time and attention,

510
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:10,708
and only one of whom
can be satisfied.

511
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:12,443
Okay. That's
a good analogy.

512
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:15,613
But, you know,
what-what do we do?

513
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,214
What, you're asking
me for a ruling?

514
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:19,216
Yeah. Why not?

515
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:21,318
You do a lot of clever
metaphor-making in here, Doctor,

516
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:22,720
and not much
solution-providing.

517
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:26,123
Then I say...
trust your instincts.

518
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:29,827
No. No. See,
that's not an answer,

519
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:32,163
because my instincts
are telling me to help Dan,

520
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,299
and his instincts are
telling him to help Fred.

521
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,268
Well, if that's
what you both think,

522
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:38,803
then you have
your answer.

523
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,406
I knew you were
gonna say that.

524
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:48,546
Hey, T! T!

525
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:49,747
Nooner!
Hey!

526
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:51,515
Got some good news, buddy.

527
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,684
We got the tap on Perez's
cousin's cell phone.

528
00:23:53,752 --> 00:23:55,252
Charlie called him
two hours ago,

Dan, this case is not about
cleaning up your mess.

The truth is,

632

you just want to make this
collar so you can keep

treats for the next couple of years.

Oh, I thought
it was Snowy 2.

636

when we fight?

637
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:51,548

Drink it all in, boys.

639
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:56,252

the guys who brought us here,

640
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,321
even when they're
not teaching us by example.

641
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:01,124

00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,110
I'm of the opinion
that if we leave

647
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:23,413
these two out of it,
our lives will get a lot easier.

00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:07,410
I don't suppose he, uh,
told you his first name?

706
00:32:07,478 --> 00:32:10,413
Um... I think it was Donald.

707
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,549
I hailed a cab for him a few times,
but he didn't talk much.

708
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:15,585
I remember
he had some wild eyes.

709
00:32:15,652 --> 00:32:18,020
One brown, one blue.

710
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,059
How you doing, Charlie?

711
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:25,395
Well...

712
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:29,899
We know

713
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:32,168
who your lawyer is, Charlie.

714
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:34,070
We know that he's the man
that you picked up

715
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:35,671
from the Wilshire
Sands Hotel.

716
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:37,573
He's <i>El Ingeniero,</i> isn't he?

717
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,342
I don't know
what you're talking about.

718
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,576
Whatever he told you
to get you to confess,

719
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:41,811
whatever deal
you think you struck...

720
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:43,446
Hey...
He's lying, man.

721
00:32:43,514 --> 00:32:45,314
All right, Travis, take it
easy on him. Can't you see

722
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:47,116
he's having a tough day, okay?
He'll come around.

723
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:48,951
We can help you right now.

724
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:51,154
You know what,
you're a loose end.

725
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,523
And I promise you,
as soon as you get to county...

726
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,791
they'll take care of you.

727
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:57,293
We're trying
to help you.

728
00:32:57,361 --> 00:32:59,595
It's not about me.

729
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:00,997
Who's it about?

730
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:02,432
You know who these people are.

731
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:03,866
You know what they do.

732
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,935
You really want
to throw in with them?

733
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,174
This guy, <i>El Ingeniero...</i>

734
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,708
he showed me a picture.

735
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,781
It's my wife and my kid.

736
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,218
He's got 'em.

737
00:33:36,045 --> 00:33:37,645
Hi, you've reached Martha Perez.
Please leave a message,

738
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:39,714
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

739
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:41,708
Okay.
You hear anything?

740
00:33:41,775 --> 00:33:43,543
No.

741
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,845
Uniform has been swinging
by the hotel to check on him,

742
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:48,281
says the room's empty and they
have not checked out yet.

743
00:33:48,348 --> 00:33:49,849
There you are.
Where the hell you guys been?

744
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,851
T, I've been calling your
cell phone...

745
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,586
Dan, Dan, not now.

746
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:54,687
<i>El Ingeniero's</i> got

747
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:56,255
Charlie Perez's wife and kid.

748
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:58,024
What?
Yes.

749
00:33:58,092 --> 00:34:00,026
All right, look...
No.

750
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:02,028
Here's what we do...
No, no, no, no. Okay, w-w-wait.

751
00:34:02,096 --> 00:34:03,362
I...

752
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,898
I am the decider now.

753
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:08,134
You don't have to boss
of me anymore; you don't...

754
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:09,969
get to solve this case,
and that's just the way it is...

755
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:11,871
man.

756
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,373
What the hell's
that all about?

757
00:34:14,441 --> 00:34:15,775
I think Travis just had

758
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:18,111
a breakthrough.
We can analyze that later, okay?

759
00:34:18,178 --> 00:34:19,612
<i>El Ingeniero</i> is
alive and well.

760
00:34:20,763 --> 00:34:22,363
<i>El Ingeniero</i>
may be alive and well,

761
00:34:22,402 --> 00:34:23,810
but we don't know
where he is, Fred.

762
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,945
we don't even know
his real name.

763
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,847
The Saavedra cartel

764
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:28,315
knows how to get in touch
with <i>El Ingeniero.</i>

765
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:29,783
Miguel--

766
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:31,549
from the car wash--
he's got a line to him.

767
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,318
You think he's gonna tell us
where to look?

768
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,519
He will if he's
properly motivated.

769
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:35,653
Dan...
No, T, T, T,

770
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:37,355
I'm cool.

771
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:40,024
I'm cool. I just want to help.
I really do.

772
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:41,359
Look, you two guys,

773
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:42,894
you know how
to get to the truth

774
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:44,863
by sitting on it and waiting
and waiting, and you did.

775
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,397
You did the right thing.
You got the answers

776
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:48,399
you were looking for.
You were right. I admit it.

777
00:34:50,102 --> 00:34:52,837
What I want to know is...

778
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:55,874
Well, are you willing
to get your hands dirty?

779
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:01,112
You haven't even told me
why I'm here.

780
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,480
Here you go, gentlemen.

781
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:04,182
Signed, sealed,
and delivered.

782
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,850
I'm gonna sue you guys for this.
Yeah,

783
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:07,519
yeah, yeah.

784
00:35:07,586 --> 00:35:10,021
What happened
to your hand, Miguel?

785
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:11,656
That stupid dog bit me.

786
00:35:11,724 --> 00:35:13,191
Now will

787
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:14,959
somebody tell me
why the hell I'm here?

788
00:35:15,027 --> 00:35:17,228
- I'm out on bail.
- Yeah, we know.

789
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:18,863
Your lawyer sprung you.
But here's the thing, uh,

790
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,265
my partner and I were
just talking about

791
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:22,233
this whole World War III
thing that happened

792
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:23,902
over at your car wash
the other day.

793
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:25,904
I don't know if you
know this or not,

794
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:28,106
but stressful situations like...

795
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:31,209
a bunch of men firing at you
with automatic weapons,

796
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:32,844
that just clouds up your memory.
Yeah.

797
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:34,345
Yeah, we talked about it.

798
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:36,247
And we realized
we had it all wrong.

799
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:37,982
But now we're clear.
See,

800
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,852
you were holding
one of those guns.

801
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,354
What?

802
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:45,290
No, that's a straight lie.

803
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:47,025
No, that's attempted murder,
two counts.

804
00:35:47,092 --> 00:35:48,426
And you can

805
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:49,561
hire a lawyer,
you can complain

806
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:50,995
all you want,
but who

807
00:35:51,063 --> 00:35:52,797
do you think
a jury is gonna believe?

808
00:35:52,865 --> 00:35:55,300
You, a loan shark fronting
a business for a drug cartel,

809
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:57,802
or two
decorated detectives?

810
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,004
You can't do that.

811
00:36:00,072 --> 00:36:01,673
I didn't shoot anybody.

812
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,941
We're gonna do it.

813
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:04,676
Yeah, we did it.

814
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:05,977
Oh, yeah, you're
going to jail.

815
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:07,011
Long time.
Done.

816
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,179
There it is.
See you in court.

817
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:09,881
Bye-bye.
No, w-w-wait.

818
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,282
Wait. Hang on.
Hang on.

819
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,622
All right, Miguel...

820
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,524
we're feeling generous today.

821
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:22,093
So you tell us
what we want to know,

822
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:23,828
we'll reconsider.

823
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:27,131
Where is <i>El Ingeniero?</i>

824
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,634
And where is Charlie Perez's family?
You tell us that,

825
00:36:29,702 --> 00:36:30,735
we'll forget
about what happened

826
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,403
at your car wash.

827
00:36:36,442 --> 00:36:40,111
He's leaving the country
tomorrow morning.

828
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:42,780
And I've never known
the man to travel

829
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:44,983
unless he's done with a job.

830
00:37:06,438 --> 00:37:07,939
Shh.

831
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:14,612
Go.

832
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,021
LAPD!

833
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,856
Drop your weapons;
get your hands in the air!

834
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:32,130
But do not shoot,
he has hostages!

835
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:50,715
Go, go, go.

836
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,552
Dan.

837
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,586
Dan!

838
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:58,323
Got him?

839
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:00,792
Yeah.

840
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:08,733
You're okay.

841
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:13,905
Well, the EMT's saying
you're gonna be fine.

842
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:16,374
Just have to learn to shoot
with your left hand.

843
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:20,311
No, my shooting
days are over.

844
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:22,880
Why? What are you saying?

845
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:25,483
Eh, maybe my lieutenant
was right.

846
00:38:25,551 --> 00:38:28,319
The era of the cowboy cop
is over.

847
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:30,588
Might be time
for me to settle into

848
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,658
a desk job, leave all this
to the new generation.

849
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:36,527
From what I can see,
you guys are doing okay.

850
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:39,197
We're trying, sir.
We're trying.

851
00:38:39,264 --> 00:38:40,932
It doesn't mean
you're gonna get a minivan.

852
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:44,202
Hey.

853
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:46,137
T?

854
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:49,307
I know you promised
me the collar, but...

855
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,642
I think it should
go to Bandak.

856
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,444
He needs it more than me,

857
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:56,114
and besides that grumpy
son of a bitch was right.

858
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:58,015
Should I tell him
you said that?

859
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,318
Just the grumpy
son of a bitch part.

860
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:03,454
Stay ready.

861
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:05,022
Sir, you don't
have to get ready.

862
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,524
You said it.

863
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,050
Charlie's agreed to testify

864
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:17,685
against the cartel.

865
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:19,354
And in exchange,
the government has agreed

866
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:22,357
to put the Perez family
into the WITSEC program.

867
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:25,326
Give them a new start in life.

868
00:39:25,394 --> 00:39:27,495
Nice collar, boys.

869
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:29,063
Nice collar.

870
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:34,135
Thanks, Cap.
This was not ours, though.

871
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:36,671
This one belongs to
the Missing Persons Department.

872
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:38,773
Sorry fellas,
but I'm gonna have to object.

873
00:39:38,841 --> 00:39:42,210
It's not my arrest,
it's yours.

874
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:44,946
What are you talking about, sir?
You need this.

875
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:47,415
Missing Persons is a thing
of the past.

876
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:49,417
No collar's
gonna change that.

877
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:52,854
So what are you
gonna do now?

878
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:55,323
I have no earthly idea.

879
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:57,759
I guess I'll think
of something.

880
00:39:57,826 --> 00:39:59,327
Wes,

881
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:03,031

a fine detective.

882
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:05,566
Travis,

883
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:07,735

Ha, funny guy.

884
00:40:07,803 --> 00:40:09,203
Mike.

885
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:10,872

886
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:12,240

887
00:40:12,308 --> 00:40:13,675
They were men before
they came here

888
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:15,143
because of guys like you.

889
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,812
I appreciate that.

890
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:21,115
Dinnertime.

891
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:25,553
See ya in the funny papers.

892
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,124
Wow.

893
00:40:30,192 --> 00:40:33,027
You are so gonna end up
with a little dog like that.

894
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:34,262
You're so gonna wind up
with an old,

895
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,997
beat-up sports car like Dan's.

896
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:37,231
Trudy?

897
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:38,633
Come on, man.
Trudy's O.G.

898
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:40,635
O.G.? What does that mean?
Old and grimy?

899
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:41,903
She has one working
headlight.

900
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,304
Boys.
What?

901
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:44,772

902
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,107
He started it.
But we waitin'.

903
00:40:46,175 --> 00:40:48,509
Get out.
