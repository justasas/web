1
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:10,181
Wes, you're early.

2
00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:12,083
Uh, do you need a minute?

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:14,152
'Cause I can just wait out
in the hall.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,287
No, sit.

5
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:17,255
Come, sit.

6
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:19,824
I've been wanting to have a word
with you in private, anyway.

7
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:21,526
Okay.

8
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:25,597
How do you feel
it's going? Therapy?

9
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:28,933
Well, I hated it at first.

10
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,669
Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:31,903
But it is occasionally...

12
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:33,838
helpful.

13
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:35,407
I can't tell you
how happy I am

14
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:37,275
to hear you say that.

15
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:40,312
You are the most
complicated patient

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,547
I have ever had.

17
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:46,051
Do you think you're ready

18
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:48,053
to go to the next step?

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,421
Next step?

20
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:51,990
You and me.
Private sessions.

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,129
Because there is a
connection there, Wes.

22
00:00:58,197 --> 00:00:59,831
Don't pretend
you haven't felt it.

23
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,866
I, uh...

24
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:03,468
Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:11,042
People are gonna
be here any minute.

26
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,445
Any minute.

27
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,014
What do you say, Wes?

28
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,717
We have to get you ready
for the first exercise.

29
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:42,607
Travis, it's not even
7:00 in the morning.

30
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:44,676
Never too early
to catch a bad guy.

31
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:46,711
Come on, get up, man.
Get out of bed.

32
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,279
Just got a break
in the hijacking case.

33
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:50,281
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,172
That's Barry Kennefick.

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,974
His buddies at the Port
call him Barry Forty

36
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:16,941
because...

37
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:19,043
he likes malt liquor.

38
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,679
Anyway, Forensics has just
been scrubbing the computers

39
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:23,148
of all the dispatchers
at the Port.

40
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,616
Turns out Barry's been
sending off e-mails

41
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:27,152
from a private account,
one for every truck

42
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,220
that's been jacked
on its way out.

43
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:31,689
Okay, so Barry's tipping
off the hijackers. All right.

44
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:33,858
Yeah, giving up the routes
and describing the cargo.

45
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:35,693
I figure we
lean on him hard enough,

46
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:38,930
maybe he'll give up
the actual thieves.

47
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:40,865
So when's he getting here?

48
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:43,001
Well, he's
not working today.

49
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:45,503
I guess he'll
be home eventually.

50
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:46,604
Hmm.

51
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:48,940
Yeah.

52
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:52,110
Yeah.

53
00:02:52,178 --> 00:02:55,013
You ever dream about Dr. Ryan?

54
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:00,118
No. Why?

55
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:01,486
No.

56
00:03:01,554 --> 00:03:02,720
No!
You?

57
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:04,789
Never mind.
No, no, no.

58
00:03:04,857 --> 00:03:07,225
What kind of dreams
you been having about Dr. Ryan?

59
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:09,060
Look, I...
I don't want to...

60
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:11,296
Fine.

61
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:14,098
They're just,
you know, they're...

62
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,134
dreams.
Okay.

63
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,069
You dirty dog, you.

64
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:21,072
It's involuntary, okay?
I mean, I can't help it.

65
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,741
Ever since she showed up
with that ring on her finger.

66
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:25,176
I can't help
but think about it.

67
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:26,544
Her personal life, you know?

68
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:27,779
Yeah, how many dreams?
What happened?

69
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:29,314
How's she smell?
How's she feel?

70
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,949
Leave nothing out.
Travis, that's between...

71
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:32,450
All right, that's
between me and her, okay?

72
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:33,885
No, it's between you
and the dream version of her.

73
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:35,420
You got to be so smart,
don't you?

74
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:36,988
I'm trying to confide
something in you...

75
00:03:37,056 --> 00:03:38,323
Confide in me, brother.
And you're being smart.

76
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,624
Trust me. I want to hear
all the details

77
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:40,825
That's him.

78
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,494
Thank God.

79
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:44,562
This conversation isn't over.

80
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:57,575
Hey, Barry Forty?

81
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:00,345
LAPD.

82
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:01,646
Why do they always think

83
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:03,147
they can get away?
I don't know.

84
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:11,089
Got him.

85
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:20,865
You might want
to consolidate those keys.

86
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,768
Just keep the
important ones.

87
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:26,671
Make them easier to find
when you're in a jam. Like this.

88
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:28,172
Put them down.
Get out of the car.

89
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:35,313
I'm cooperating here, guys.

90
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:37,015
I'll give you names,
phone numbers...

91
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:38,616
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay,
we'll get to that.

92
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:40,818
So, these dreams--
did you have one last night?

93
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:42,520
Travis, I do not
want to talk about it.

94
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:43,955
You brought it up.
In a moment of weakness,

95
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,557
I brought it up.
You were confiding in me.

96
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:46,891
We spend a lot of
time together.

97
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,259
I think it's
perfectly natural

98
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:51,963
that she shows up in
my dreams, all right?

99
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:53,898
Was she naked?
She was naked.

100
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:55,166
Oh, man.

101
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:57,969
Wait, wait, wait.

102
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:00,872
I'm definitely
awake right now, right?

103
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,308
Not dreaming?
Yeah. Ow.

104
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:09,914
Huh.

105
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,816
Dietz.

106
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:13,418
Yeah, what's up?
Hey, man, uh,

107
00:05:13,485 --> 00:05:15,019
can you take this guy
to the box for us, please?

108
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:17,255
Yeah, you got it.

109
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,990
You're not gonna
say anything, right?

110
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:22,260
Travis?
Dr. Ryan.

111
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:24,662
Hey, Wes was just
talking about you.

112
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,197
What brings you down here?

113
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:27,665
Hey, guys, I'm, uh, I'm just,

114
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,767
I'm waiting for Captain Sutton.

115
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:32,103
You okay?

116
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,605
Yes. Fine.

117
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:36,674
Sorry.

118
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:37,742
I'm rattled.

119
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,811
Um, Robert, my fiancé,

120
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:41,412

Hi. Hi.

I recognize you
from the news.

139
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:41,246
I saw you on the--
You were building malls.

140
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:42,814
On the east side, right?

141
00:06:42,882 --> 00:06:45,183
Yeah, marketing people
prefer to call them

142
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,886
open-air retail communities,
but guilty.

143
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,421
So, um,

144
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:50,956
what happened to you?

145
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:55,227
I'm building this new
development in Atwater Village.

146
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:57,429
I was just working late last
night, and a couple kids jumped

147
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:59,297
me on the way to my car...
We talked about this.

148
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:00,966
Yeah, we did talk about this.

149
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,234
Guys, don't have to
get involved in this.

150
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,403
It's a conflict of interest.

151
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,704
What? Why?

152
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,472
Why is there a conflict
of interest?

153
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,842
Oh. Oh.

154
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,845
She does not talk about
her work at home.

155
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,714
I promise you that.
But I did know

156
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,683
that she was working
with a couple of cops.

157
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,551
I just assumed that it was
a man and a woman.

158
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,888
No, just us.

159
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:24,056
Okay, you're done
with your statement?

160
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:26,825
I am.
Thank you so much.

161
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,593
Guys, I will see you
both later.

162
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,762
- Yeah.
- We'll do what we can

163
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,597
to catch these guys
that tuned you up.

164
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,232
I appreciate that, Captain,
but seriously...

165
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,234
Please do not break your back
on my account.

166
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:37,402
It was a mugging.

167
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,037
I got to go.

168
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:41,073
And honestly, I would not
even of come down here

169
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,275
to make a report if this one
had not insisted.

170
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:45,177
Nice to meet you.

171
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,313
Huh.

172
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,782
No. No "huh."

173
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,451
She's your doctor, huh?

174
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:53,919
You stay away from
this, all right?

175
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:56,688
I gave the case to
Stiefvater and Rafalski.

176
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,523
Stiefvater and Rafalski?

177
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:00,029
Captain, What are you,
mad at Dr. Ryan?

178
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:00,992
No.

179
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:02,627
They were working the night tour
last night.

180
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:04,396
So I gave them the case.

181
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:08,200
Plus, you guys have
a hijacking ring to break up.

182
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,768
Yes...

183
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,340
Hmm.

184
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,345
You're gonna e-mail your
contacts in this hijacking ring.

185
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,013
You're gonna tell them
there's a truck

186
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,982
headed out today

187
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,585
that they're
gonna want to rob.

188
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:28,453
What should I tell them
is in it?

189
00:08:28,521 --> 00:08:30,288
What are they
looking for?

190
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,773
<i>Air bags?</i>

191
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,408
<i>Why would anybody</i>
<i>want to steal 800 airbags?</i>

192
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,744
Black market
for everything, man.

193
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:55,147
Does he seem
kind of like a...

194
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:57,783
weatherman?

195
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,619
Who?
Dr. Ryan's fiancé.

196
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,821
Robert.

197
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:04,589
You got a developer?

198
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:06,858
I always saw her
with someone more serious.

199
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:08,460
Yeah, yeah,
someone intense, huh?

200
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:10,162
Brooding?

201
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,596
Someone who nobly
fights his tendency

202
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,532
to irritate others?

203
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,834
You think you are so smart.
I'm not talking about me.

204
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:18,003
Hmm. Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

205
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,171
Yes, you are.
I mean, listen,

206
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:20,472
subconscious doesn't lie.

207
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,340
Travis, that guy
blow dries his hair.

208
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:33,552
<i>Dr. Ryan has substance.</i>

209
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:36,354
She volunteers her time
to treat us.

210
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,323
Think about that.

211
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:40,759
Surprises me she'd be seeing
a guy who builds malls,

212
00:09:40,827 --> 00:09:41,893
that's all.

213
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,528
Yeah, but...

214
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,463
I mean, really,
you don't really know her,

215
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,165
and you sure as hell
don't know him,

216
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,100
so why would you
be surprised?

217
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,669
You're a terrible
conversationalist,

218
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,204
you know that?

219
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:53,538
Here we go.

220
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:02,814
I think you
should tell her.

221
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:05,150
Hmm? What?

222
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,786
Dr. Ryan, I think
you should tell her

223
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:09,821
that you've developed
serious, passionate...

224
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:11,122
feelings for her.
What?!

225
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,824
Yeah.
No.

226
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,492
A: I haven't developed
any feelings,

227
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,627
and B: No.

228
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:24,302
LAPD!
Don't move.

229
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,137
Get down on the ground.
Right now.

230
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:27,939
Now!
Slowly.

231
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,709
Easy...

232
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,481
You okay?
Yeah. Go, go, go, go!

233
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,651
Put the cuffs on him now.

234
00:10:43,823 --> 00:10:46,725
LAPD! Put your hands in
the air! Do it!

235
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:51,263
Whoo! You're out of there!

236
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,832
Whoa! Nice play at
the plate, baby.

237
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,267
You're under arrest.

238
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:56,801
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

239
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:58,536
All right!

240
00:10:58,604 --> 00:10:59,804
You see that, Dietz?

241
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:01,740
Hey, you know what?

242
00:11:01,807 --> 00:11:05,410
I think I'm gonna have to tell
Dr. Ryan about them dreams.

243
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:06,678
What?

244
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:08,813
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to tell her.

245
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:11,049
You can't do that?
Why not?

246
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,618
'Cause, you know-- Bro Code.

247
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:16,821
No, no. See, you don't
subscribe to Bro Code.

248
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,189
We already been
through this.

249
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:20,025
Are you guys gonna read me
my rights?

250
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,526
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we'll get to that.

251
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:24,696
Catcher's mask?

252
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:26,231
What's wrong with the
catcher's mask? They're cool.

253
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:30,035
I can still see your
face, dumb-ass!

254
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:35,173
That's one hijacking
ring off the books.

255
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,910
Let's pull out
some open cases

256
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:41,179
and see what we can
attack next, huh?

257
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,484
Yeah, we could do that.

258
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:48,019
Should do that.

259
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,688
What else would we do?

260
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,560
Yeah, Mr. Mitchell,
I... this is...

261
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:57,495
Stiefvater's here?

262
00:11:57,563 --> 00:11:58,897
Hmm.

263
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,799
What's he doing
working the day shift?

264
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:02,901
I don't know.
But we could ask him

265
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,903
how it's going
with Dr. Ryan's thing.

266
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:06,938
We're not supposed
to get involved.

267
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:10,442
We're just checking up.
No rule against that, right?

268
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,512
That's a business expense.

269
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,482
Yes, seriously.

270
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,984
I have a stressful job, i.e.,

271
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,619
I need a place in Ojai
to unwind,

272
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,855
i.e., business expense.

273
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,491
You know, I think
you're saying "i.e."

274
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,726
where you mean "ergo."

275
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,527
I-I gotta go.

276
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:32,998
What do you guys want?

277
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:35,667
Well, you caught a mugging.
How's it going?

278
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:37,869
Sutton told me not to
talk to you guys about that.

279
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,738
You make any arrests yet?

280
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:42,507
I got a full caseload,
and I'm getting audited.

281
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,809
You think we got time
to work a favor job for Sutton?

282
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:47,312
I think you caught a case.
You should work it.

283
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,682
I <i>am</i> working it.

284
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,018
I gotta go, guys.

285
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,586
That's fine. Okay.

286
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:56,354
Keep up the good work.

287
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,426
You got it?

288
00:13:01,494 --> 00:13:02,894
Indeed, I did.

289
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,963
Dr. Ryan's is a
woman of substance.

290
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:06,831
She deserves a much better
class of detective.

291
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,800
Upstairs.
Downtown.

292
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:13,138
So, weatherman Bob goes
by his construction site

293
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,672
in the middle
of the night.

294
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,341
Not a weatherman.
He's one

295
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,676
of the most successful
builders in L.A.

296
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:20,345
Okay, fine.

297
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,946
So, the builder goes there
to check, make sure

298
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,548
his equipment's all stocked,

299
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:24,549
and he gets jumped by two
African-Americans

300
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:25,950
on the way back to his BMW.

301
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,552
Yeah. about that,

302
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,154
they just ran up
and clocked him?

303
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:30,789
He didn't even see their faces

304
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:33,191
These construction
site's have a lot

305
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,859
of valuable stuff
lying around.

306
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,095
I'm sure there's a
night watchman on duty.

307
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:38,563
Abort.

308
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,031
Hey, I got a captains' meeting

309
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,266
in here in a little while.

310
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,434
What are you guys

311
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:43,835
doing in here?

312
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:45,236
Well, we wrapped up
the hijacking,

313
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,038
so we're just reviewing
open cases.

314
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,773
And you can't do that
from your own desk?

315
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:49,908
Oh, it's too loud
out there, Cap.

316
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:51,142
Have a good meeting.

317
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,144
Yeah.

318
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:54,879
Whew!

319
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:04,656
Robert Ewell
has you working nights?

320
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:06,958
Yeah, I was on
shift last night.

321
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,793
But I'm confused.

322
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:12,163
One guy hit Mr. Ewell,
and he wasn't black.

323
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,365
You're sure?
Positive. But I heard

324
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:17,735
a call coming in,
so I went to the front gate.

325
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:19,504
A guy had just let
himself in.

326
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:20,872
Had a key and
everything.

327
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,341
Why didn't you call
the police?

328
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,543
Mr. Ewell told me
not to.

329
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,045
Mr. Ewell lied to us.

330
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:29,247
I knew there was
something off about him.

331
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,916
What did the attacker
look like?

332
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:34,853
He was, like, mid-20ish.

333
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,055
Dark skin,
but like European dark.

334
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,490
Armenian, Turkish,
something like that.

335
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:40,358
Is this the spot?

336
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:43,194
Yeah. Everything
looks normal.

337
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,696
I don't think
he took anything.

338
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,574
Sorry.

339
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,480
You seeing what I'm seeing?

340
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,249
Yeah.

341
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,392
It's not even done setting yet.

342
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,861
This poured concrete, did one
of the workers lay this in?

343
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,129
No, I don't think so.

344
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:23,902
I've been absolutely dying
to use this thing.

345
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:26,237
The department
wouldn't spring for it,

346
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:28,806
so I finally broke down
and got it myself.

347
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:31,142
You paid for that
thing on your own?

348
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,977
One of the advantages
of flipping

349
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,546
your company before you're 30.

350
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,781
That's gonna tell us
what's in there, huh?

351
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:39,817
Yep. It uses ultrasound.

352
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,131
Well, looks like nothing.

353
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,300
Wait, hold on.

354
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:58,570
There we go.

355
00:15:58,637 --> 00:16:00,171
What is that, a face?

356
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,507
Hey, there.

357
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:05,109
Who are you?

358
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:27,357
Hey, what's going on?

359
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,325
Why'd you you guys call
me down here?

360
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:31,461
We need to talk to you
about last night.

361
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:33,363
Oh. I thought you weren't
supposed

362
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,798
to be looking into that.

363
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:37,267
Well, we were naughty.

364
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:39,536
But you know a little something
about that, don't you?

365
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,906
What's this?

366
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:46,042
There's a dead guy
down in there?

367
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,077
Who is he?

368
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:50,513
We were wondering if
you could tell us that, Robert.

369
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:52,482
I have no idea!

370
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,150
You lied about getting mugged,
Robert. Your word doesn't have

371
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:55,518
a whole lot of credibility
right now.

372
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:57,854
And I get that.
Look, I am sorry about that.

373
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:01,057
But...

374
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,325
but this?

375
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:04,260
Come on. I build things.
I don't get

376
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:05,895
involved in
this kind of thing.

377
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,130
Then who beat you up?

378
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,199
I don't know.

379
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:11,935
Honestly, I don't.

380
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:14,971
I am in construction.
I'm not a criminal,

381
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,673
but if I want
to get anything done,

382
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,308
sometimes I have
to do business with them.

383
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,243
Did you do business with
criminals here?

384
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,912
The head of the Steam and
Pipe Fitters' Union is a man

385
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,148
named Aram Parisyan.

386
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:27,584
He is not a great guy,
from what I've heard.

387
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:30,220
I had to issue him a payment

388
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:32,589
to ensure that my workers
would show up. Cash.

389
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:34,958
You bribed him.

390
00:17:35,025 --> 00:17:37,193
This is the way the construction
business works, okay?

391
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:40,163
Now, Parisyan, he thought that
gave him the run of the place.

392
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:42,031
He wanted keys,
he told me his people

393
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,867
were gonna be coming
through day and night.

394
00:17:43,934 --> 00:17:47,303
And I said no, but obviously
somehow they got keys anyway.

395
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,805
Was Aram Parisyan here
last night?

396
00:17:48,873 --> 00:17:50,006
No, just that guy.

397
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:53,443
Tell us about him.

398
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,445
He was driving
a Mercedes.

399
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:57,847
And he held up his fist
before hit me,

400
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:01,017
he had tattoos, like,
letters on his knuckles.

401
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:04,621
"R.I.P." on one hand--
like Rest in Peace--

402
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:06,022
and "Anna" on the other.

403
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,759
Guys, guys,
know that

404
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:11,761
I'm not in a position to ask,

405
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,630
but you have,
you have to do me a favor.

406
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:15,598
I mean, Emma and I...

407
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,334
we're planning a wedding in
Descanso Gardens in two months.

408
00:18:18,402 --> 00:18:21,471
You just can't tell her
about this. I know

409
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:23,473
I was wrong to pay
that bribe, I know that.

410
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,808
And the only reason
I lied about it to you was

411
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:27,510
that so Emma
wouldn't find out.

412
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:30,980
Really, I'm not
a bad guy, okay?

413
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,816
I just got in
over my head here.

414
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:40,890
I was specific when I told you

415
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,126
to stay the hell away
from this case!

416
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:44,427
Whoa, Cap.
Deep breaths, man.

417
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:45,361
Let's find your
little happy place, man.

418
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:46,763
How about some serenity?

419
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,131
I'll find my happy place.

420
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:50,266
I had my happy place until you

421
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:52,468
walked into this room and set
these pictures on my desk!

422
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,537
Okay, you're mad.
Really?

423
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,906
Just tell us what
you want us to do here.

424
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,741
You got a body.
You got to work it.

425
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,710
We are working it, Cap.

426
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:02,478
We got the medical examiner's
office is digging the body

427
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:04,447
out of the concrete. We're
trying to get an I.D.

428
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,215
We sent a description
of the ink on

429
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:08,384
the guy's knuckles
to Gang squads,

430
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:10,301
but what I'm asking is

431
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:12,360
what do you want us to do
about Dr. Ryan, Captain?

432
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:14,157
What about her?

433
00:19:14,224 --> 00:19:17,393
Well, the man she's planning
to marry bribed some gangsters

434
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:19,462
who buried a corpse
at his construction site.

435
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,164
Everyone makes bribes

436
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:22,832
in the construction business.

437
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,300
It doesn't mean that
Ewell's a bad guy.

438
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:25,501
No, but maybe
Dr. Ryan should decide

439
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:26,736
whether or not
he's a bad guy.

440
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:28,338
Maybe you should let him decide.
Enough.

441
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:29,305
That's what I want...
That's enough!

442
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:30,773
I happen to know this guy.

443
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:33,476
He paid a bribe,
and then he lied about it.

444
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:35,812
I'm not saying that's
the right thing to do,

445
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,947
but we don't have the right
to put our noses

446
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,349
in Dr. Ryan's business!

447
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,883
When's your next session?

448
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,986
In about 45 minutes.
Later tonight.

449
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:45,088
Okay. Listen to me.

450
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:48,758
This girl's responsible
for changing my life,

451
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:50,460
and God bless her,
she's actually trying

452
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:52,595
to do the same thing
for you two guys.

453
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,931
Stay the hell
out of it!

454
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:59,135
Just go to the session and be
your usual stupid selves!

455
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:01,404
No problem.
Wes has got lots to talk

456
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:03,373
to her about, anyway.
No, I don't.

457
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,074
What's going on, kid?

458
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:06,468
Wes is having sex dreams
about Dr. Ryan.

459
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:07,577
No, no.

460
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:10,847
Oh, sex dreams.

461
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,583
What do you mean,
Yeah, the sex dreams"?

462
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,817
You having 'em, too?

463
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:17,887
Well, I did. It's, it's natural.

464
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,255
See? That's what
I was saying.

465
00:20:19,323 --> 00:20:21,257
You should talk to her about it.

466
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:22,658
See? Now that's what
I was saying.

467
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:24,160
Travis,
you say a one word,

468
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:26,763
I'll kill you
where you're sitting.

469
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,642
Hey, Dr. Ryan.
How's it going?

470
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,177
Hi. Hey.

471
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:44,047
So...

472
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:47,683
what is on the
agenda for tonight?

473
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:50,620
It's up to the group,
isn't it?

474
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,288
How come we never talk
about dreams in here?

475
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:53,656
Travis.

476
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:55,425
Do you want to talk
about dreams?

477
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:56,692
I think Wes
would love to.

478
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:01,397
Okay, I not going
to be held hostage here.

479
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,666
I'm a cop, a cop knows

480
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,701
how to deal with
a blackmail threats.

481
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,570
You put it everything
on the table.

482
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:09,505
You reclaim your power.

483
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:13,309
So, I've been having
dreams about you.

484
00:21:13,377 --> 00:21:14,911
Go on.

485
00:21:14,978 --> 00:21:17,480
Yes, please,
go on.

486
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,818
They're are, uh...

487
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:24,987
Oh!
scintillating in nature.

488
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:28,191
And I can't help it.

489
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:29,525
I really would like 'em
to stop,

490
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:31,194
so please help me make
them go away.

491
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:33,129
Oh, Wes, you don't have
to be embarrassed.

492
00:21:33,197 --> 00:21:34,997
It's very common.

493
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:38,468
In fact, it's probably my
favorite side effect of therapy.

494
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:42,205
You're happy about this?

495
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,840
Well, I'm flattered.

496
00:21:43,907 --> 00:21:45,441
Haven't you been dreaming
about me?

497
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:51,948
Uh... no.

498
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:53,749
No?

499
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:55,184
You don't find me attractive?

500
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:58,221
Yeah. Yeah.

501
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:00,356
Yeah, sure I... I do.

502
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:02,225
Ab-Absolutely.

503
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:04,060
Oh, good. Let's get to work.

504
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,531
Wes, would you excuse us?

505
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:13,002
Yeah.

506
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:17,073
Yeah.

507
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:19,242
Could you tell the others

508
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:22,211
that I'm gonna need 20
minutes alone with my patient?

509
00:22:31,355 --> 00:22:35,258
Damn it!

510
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:36,926
Oh, this is all your fault.
What?

511
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:38,661
What? I caught the
dreams from you.

512
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,264
They're dreams, Travis.
Not the flu.

513
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:43,366
Morning, Wes.
Just give me a minute

514
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,468
while I finish up
with our friend here.

515
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:46,836
No problem.

516
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:49,839
Hi, Jonelle.

517
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:52,241
Right.

518
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:58,414
So, they always
start in therapy.

519
00:22:58,482 --> 00:22:59,815
What?

520
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:01,184
My dream.

521
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:03,586
Yeah?

522
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:06,856
Me, too.

523
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:10,359
Listen, no details,
but, uh...

524
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:14,130
it almost started just like
our last therapy session.

525
00:23:14,198 --> 00:23:16,299
You got there early,
it's a little bit awkward,

526
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:19,869
then things start
happening... differently.

527
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:21,537
We started talking
about your dreams.

528
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:23,406
You sold me out
to Dr. Ryan?

529
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:26,342
You sold me out to
Dr. Ryan in your dream.

530
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,511
It was a dream.
No. Subconscious doesn't lie.

531
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,379
Okay, listen, okay,
okay, just hear me out.

532
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,449
This has to stop, okay?

533
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:36,018
It took me a long time
to accept the fact

534
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:37,753
that Dr. Ryan was
a no-fly zone.

535
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:39,322
I can't let my deviant
subconscious start

536
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:40,790
to mess with that.

537
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:42,992
What am I supposed
to do about the dream?

538
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,627
You boys getting are hot
for teacher.

539
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:47,964
How much of that
did you hear?

540
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:50,333
Only the
good parts.

541
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:56,539
So, I guess I have you two
to thank so very, very much

542
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:57,974
for keeping me on my toes.

543
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,709
It's not every day

544
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:02,478
that I get to use a jackhammer
to identify a corpse.

545
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:04,780
It's exhausting.

546
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:08,017
Uh, what did you learn?

547
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:10,419
Your John Doe died
from blunt force trauma.

548
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:12,488
He was wearing a track
suit, so it looks like

549
00:24:12,556 --> 00:24:13,990
somebody jumped him
while he was jogging.

550
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:15,825
I got some DNA
from the assailant

551
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:17,793
underneath his fingernails,
but no match to the assailant's

552
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:22,064
DNA, but, however, your
John Doe is in the system.

553
00:24:22,132 --> 00:24:24,333
His name is Craig
Joseph Seward.

554
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:25,868
Craig Seward?
Yeah.

555
00:24:25,936 --> 00:24:27,870
I know that name.
Of course you do.

556
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:29,939
He's one of the worst
lawyers on the planet.

557
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:33,175
Well, he was.

558
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:35,411
If you've been arrested
for a D.U.I.,

559
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:37,980
don't let the government trample
on your rights.

560
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:42,018
I'm five-star D.U.I. Defense
Attorney Craig J. Seward,

561
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:44,887
and I'm ready to go
to war for you.

562
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:46,322
I hate that guy.

563
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,823
Yeah. Everybody
hates that guy.

564
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,892
Why would the Armenian
mob want him killed?

565
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,127
You mean, <i>besides</i>
his commercials?

566
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:54,697
Have to find out if
there's a connection

567
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:56,332
between Seward
and the man

568
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,967
that Dr. Ryan's
fiancé was paying off.

569
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:59,835
Parisyan?
Yeah.

570
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:01,337
All right, we'll get
to that later.

571
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:03,272
Listen, the gang squad
found a match

572
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,975
for those R.I.P. Anna tattoos
in their photo file.

573
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:07,977
They belong to a guy
named Karl Rezian.

574
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:09,845
He did two years
for aggravated assault.

575
00:25:09,913 --> 00:25:11,681
Okay, so where
do we find him?

576
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:14,216
He told his parole officer
he has a job

577
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:16,552
at a dog shelter
in Atwater Village.

578
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:28,998
I guess Anna
was a dog.

579
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:32,702
Yeah, Anna was one of our best
reclamation projects.

580
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,737
Reclamation projects?

581
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:36,539
We rescue fighting dogs here.
I have some literature

582
00:25:36,606 --> 00:25:38,274
if you guys want
to learn more about it.

583
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:41,610
LAPD.

584
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:43,312
We need to speak
to a Karl Rezian, please.

585
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,648
Uh, yeah,
he's in the back.

586
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:47,516
Thank you.

587
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:58,961
Karl Rezian?

588
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,330
Yes. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

589
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:03,733
LAPD. Can we talk
to you for a minute?

590
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,768
Attack, Shirley!

591
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:12,174
You get the dog.
I'm gonna get the car.

592
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:14,076
How do I get the dog?!

593
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:20,049
See that? It's shiny, isn't it?

594
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:21,584
Just like a human liver.

595
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:25,788
Want that? Go get it!

596
00:26:32,696 --> 00:26:34,930
Freeze!

597
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:37,166
You're under arrest
for the murder of Craig Seward.

598
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:39,402
Down on your knees. Down!

599
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:45,837
What did he do to you, Karl?
Why did you murder Craig Seward?

600
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,539
- I didn't kill anybody.
- We've got two people

601
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,641
who can place you where
his body was found, Karl.

602
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,577
Your DNA test results are
gonna be back any minute,

603
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,812
and if they match what we found
on Seward's body,

604
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,981
you're gonna go away... forever.

605
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,283
I didn't kill anybody.

606
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,085
That's all I'm saying.

607
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,554
You heard the man.
He's done talking.

608
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,189
Gentlemen,

609
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:08,292
Timothy Mullin, counsel
to Mr. Rezian.

610
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,027
I didn't call a lawyer.

611
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,630
No. My services are provided
for you free of charge.

612
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,031
Let me guess.

613
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,233
By Aram Parisyan?

614
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,335
No, that's no concern of yours.

615
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,237
Are we done here?

616
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,838
We sure as hell
are not done here.

617
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,809
DNA's back.

618
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,114
And I guess
that concludes

619
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,482
our business.
Let's go, Karl.

620
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,085
I don't think it does.
Sit down, Karl.

621
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,890
Look, even if you didn't
kill Craig Seward,

622
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,826
you dumped the body
for whoever did, didn't you?

623
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,461
We're gonna go
pick up your boss,

624
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,296
so if there's anything
you want to say to us

625
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,198
before we put cuffs
on him, you should say it.

626
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,399
As it happens,
I also represent

627
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,867
Aram Parisyan.

628
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,470
Yeah, what a coincidence.
He's aware

629
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,639
that his name has come up
during this investigation,

630
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,842
and he's willing to offer
his full cooperation.

631
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,118
Gentlemen, let me introduce
you to Aram Parisyan.

632
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,853
Hey, guys, how you doing?

633
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,689
Hi.

634
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,124
You get in a fight?
Hi.

635
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,759
What, this?

636
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,894
No, I just had my nose
done again.

637
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,183
Again?

638
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,734
Yeah, well, you know,
we keep, uh... refining.

639
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,633
I actually went in
for an eye lift,

640
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,402
but my guy offered me a rate.

641
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,271
Would your guy have
some contact information?

642
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:30,975
Absolutely. Hey, uh,
if you mention I referred you,

643
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,827
he'll give me a discount
on my next procedure.

644
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:33,778
Okay, well,

645
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,246
this isn't a referral.

646
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,480
We're just confirming
your story.

647
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,215
All right.

648
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,451
Why would you think
I wanted plastic surgery?

649
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,621
Hey, we're all racing
Father Time.

650
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,289
Doesn't hurt
to get a head start.

651
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,291
Yeah. That's
awesome.

652
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,294
Listen, the lab is down on
the third floor,

653
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,496
and the lab tech will take
your DNA swab.

654
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,565
Oh, that's okay.
I brought my own.

655
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,335
This is a piece
of my, uh, columella.

656
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,070
That's like the, um...

657
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,505
the little nub
that divides up your nose?

658
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,840
My guy took a whack
at it yesterday,

659
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,742
gave me that
as a keepsake.

660
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,612
Should be some good DNA in there.
Okay.

661
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,114
We'll stick
with the usual procedures.

662
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,649
Thank you.

663
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,285
All right,
suit yourself.

664
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,653
Lab's on the third floor.

665
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:16,988
All right.
Take care, guys.

666
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,689
Good seeing you, man.

667
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,057
Thanks for your
cooperation.

668
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,293
Really good
to see you.

669
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,329
Okay.

670
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,865
That was strange
and disgusting, but...

671
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,269
most murderers don't usually
provide their own DNA sample.

672
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,638
Well, we'll find
out soon enough.

673
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,306
Even if Parisyan's
not a match,

674
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,907
we've still got Karl Rezian
for dumping that body.

675
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,577
Yeah, but if we ask Robert Ewell
to testify,

676
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,679
Dr. Ryan's gonna know
what he did.

677
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,181
Security guard can put
Rezian at the scene.

678
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,984
Okay. Sounds good.

679
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,220
Hey, man, sweet dreams.

680
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,888
Thank you.

681
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,590
Shut up.

682
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,563
Good morning, everyone.

683
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,965
I'm sorry I'm late.
Morning.

684
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,902
Good sleep?

685
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,071
I can't take it much more.

686
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,572
You too, huh?

687
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,609
Okay, let's get started.

688
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:14,045
Wes is having dirty dreams
about you.

689
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,946
How does he get it to stop?

690
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,782
What the hell
is wrong with you?

691
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,717
Look, he's having
dirty dreams, too, okay?

692
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,585
I had, like, two.
You had, like, a hundred.

693
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,821
Okay, first of all, I did
not have a hundred, Travis.

694
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,023
I'm not a degenerate, and
secondly, I don't see why

695
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,892
we have to embarrass Dr. Ryan
by bringing this up.

696
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,394
I'm not embarrassed.
I'm encouraged.

697
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,129
Oh, no.

698
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,665
You're not gonna stand up and
take off your dress, are you?

699
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,501
No. Never mind.

700
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,970
Um, erotic dreams are

701
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,173
an extremely common occurrence
in therapy.

702
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,574
It's called transference.

703
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,142
You're hardly the first people

704
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,744
in the room
to have experienced it.

705
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,345
Really?

706
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,654
You had the dreams, too?

707
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:57,513
Cool.

708
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:59,485
I'd say it's happened to
about half my patients.

709
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,192
It's a little uncomfortable
on both sides,

710
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,027
but it's a sign
that the therapy's working.

711
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,662
Really?
It is?

712
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,697
Yes, it means
that your mind has metabolized

713
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,432
what we're doing in here.

714
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,101
It's seeped into your thoughts.

715
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,203
Hence, the dreams.

716
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,671
Okay, hold on.

717
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:17,074
So, you want us
to have dirty dreams about you?

718
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:20,478
Ah. I want you
to have breakthroughs.

719
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,713
I want you to change
your lives and how

720
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,682
you relate to each other.

721
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,517
This is just a signpost
along the way.

722
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,452
but it's a significant one,
because it means

723
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,355
that you have committed to
therapy on a subconscious level.

724
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,257
Great.

725
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,626
Uh, okay, all right.

726
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,696
Keep right on dreaming, then.

727
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,564
Right.

728
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:47,371
I, uh... I'm sorry,
but he's not in there.

729
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,906
What?

730
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:50,708
I'm sorry, but the guy

731
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,844
that drove onto the lot
that night-- he's not there.

732
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,412
Look again.

733
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,014
That's enough.

734
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,517
Wait, wait, wait.
Did Parisyan threaten you?

735
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,851
Because if he did,
we can protect you.

736
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,286
That's enough.

737
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:03,888
We had a lineup,
there was no I.D.

738
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,656
End of story.
Hey!

739
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,192
I'm sorry.

740
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,360
Yeah.

741
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,497
Rezian's DNA

742
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,932
doesn't match
the killer.

743
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,700
Parisyan's DNA does not
match the killer.

744
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,369
Our witnesses recanting
their testimony...

745
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,171
One witness.

746
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:24,074
We make Robert Ewell go on
record, this thing goes public.

747
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:28,345
Dr. Ryan knows exactly
what her fiancé did...

748
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,914
If Ewell doesn't testify,

749
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,449
the only thing you have
on this Rezian character

750
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,451
is that he sicced a dog on you.

751
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,921
Now, you guys started it,

752
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,123
you gotta live with
the consequences.

753
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:45,572
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>to do here, guys.</i>

754
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,200
A couple of
Aram Parisyan's... buddies

755
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,935
came to my office yesterday.

756
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,703
And they made it very clear

757
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,505
that I shouldn't say anything
about what I saw.

758
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,540
Well, we're pretty sure
the other witness

759
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,942
got the same treatment, 'cause
he's not talking to us either.

760
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,510
Yeah, can you blame him?

761
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,512
I mean, you can
have my DNA, fine.

762
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,647
But...

763
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,850
other than that, we're-we're
talking about my family here.

764
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,918
Okay. We will
protect your family.

765
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,220
What does that mean?

766
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,654
What, I...
I get to tell my fiancé

767
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:11,989
that we're going to have cops

768
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,858
following us around
all the time?

769
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,659
We've been doing everything
we can to keep you out of this,

770
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,994
but if you don't cooperate
with us right now,

771
00:33:17,062 --> 00:33:18,529
a man who buried

772
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:21,031
another man in concrete,
at your construction site...

773
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,233
He walks.
Okay.

774
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,902
Dr. Ryan is
a good woman.

775
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,137
And you don't think she'd
really want that, do you?

776
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,041
She's a great woman.

777
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,309
And there she is.

778
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,079
Well, we can go.

779
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:38,816
Hi, darling...

780
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,017
Hey.

781
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:42,553
What are you doing here?

782
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,322
Uh, Detective Mitchell
and Marks

783
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,657
have been investigating my case.

784
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,425
What?

785
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,327
No, I asked you
to stay out of it.

786
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,319
Yeah. We-we know.
Yeah. We know.

787
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,875
We didn't mean to,
it was this other detective,

788
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,218
he wasn't very good...
Yeah.

789
00:33:55,219 --> 00:33:56,757
And so we took his file, and we
decided we were gonna try...

790
00:33:56,782 --> 00:33:57,220
Mistake?

791
00:33:57,221 --> 00:33:58,955
...and follow up on it.
It was a mistake.

792
00:33:59,022 --> 00:34:01,028
Could someone please
tell me what is going on?

793
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:02,091
Yes.

794
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:06,109
We need to talk.

795
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:08,444
Let's go upstairs.

796
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,745
How pissed off do you think
she's gonna be?

797
00:34:20,746 --> 00:34:21,947
How pissed off
would you be?

798
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:30,622
Hi...
Robert will identify the man.

799
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,191
He'll testify at any trial.

800
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:35,594
He'll provide you with
a DNA sample that proves

801
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:37,262
he had nothing to
do with this murder.

802
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,865
We spent the night together,
we had dinner, we went to bed...

803
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:41,900
We were both woken
by the phone call.

804
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:44,436
He told me he had to
check on something at work.

805
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,741
Thank you.

806
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:52,344
Yeah. Listen, uh, Dr. Ryan,
we were just trying to...

807
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:53,845
Is there anything else you need?
No.

808
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:56,014
Good.

809
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:01,519
Pissed.
Yeah.

810
00:35:01,587 --> 00:35:03,755
We have a witness that puts
you at the site of the murder.

811
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:06,324
That's conspiracy
after the fact.

812
00:35:06,392 --> 00:35:08,026
You'll do 20 years, Karl.

813
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:09,194
Add that to the time
you're facing

814
00:35:09,262 --> 00:35:11,096
for siccing your
pit bull on us...

815
00:35:11,163 --> 00:35:12,597
you should get free just in time

816
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:15,166
to start collecting
Social Security checks, Karl.

817
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:16,401
Stop trying to
intimidate my client.

818
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:17,869
Karl, a lot can
happen at a trial.

819
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:19,104
Yeah. We could just
decide to charge him

820
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:20,572
with Craig Seward's murder.

821
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,873
Make a circumstantial
case out of it.

822
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:23,174
I didn't kill him!

823
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:24,476
You don't have to
talk to these men.

824
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:26,044
Shut up!
I didn't even hire you.

825
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:27,579
Karl.

826
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:30,415
Talk to us.
Tell us what happened.

827
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:31,983
We'll ask the D.A.
to cut a deal.

828
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:33,418
You might only do five years.

829
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:37,589
I got an e-mail.

830
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:41,293
Told me to go to the fountain
in Riverside Park

831
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,729
and bring the trash over
to that construction site.

832
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:48,533
I got there, that guy's body
was stuffed under a bench.

833
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:49,701
So I cleaned
up the garbage.

834
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:51,303
Who sent the e-mail?

835
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,338
Karl...

836
00:35:53,406 --> 00:35:56,107
Aram Parisyan.

837
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:04,482
So his DNA's wasn't
found on Seward's body,

838
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,217
but he gave Rezian the order

839
00:36:06,285 --> 00:36:08,019
to dispose of that corpse.
That's conspiracy.

840
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:09,621
Let's see if that's
enough to convince him

841
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,790
to give up the murderer.

842
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:13,491
Hey, Mullin... what are you
doing? Give me that!

843
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,659
Give it to me.

844
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:25,804
Don't let him go anywhere.

845
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:27,939
He just committed a felony.

846
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,356
Maxine, I gotta
leave early today...

847
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:47,058
You want me to
forward your calls?

848
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:48,827
Take messages...

849
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:50,895
Damn it!

850
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:56,067
Ah!
Stay down. Stay down!

851
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:03,108
My nose isn't set yet!

852
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,945
My, uh... my bad.

853
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:09,214
If you expect my client
to cooperate,

854
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:10,410
let me assure you
you're dead wrong.

855
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:12,016
Be quiet.

856
00:37:12,018 --> 00:37:13,286
We're charging you the
second we're done here.

857
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:14,252
With what?

858
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:16,121
I advised my client of a
development, that's all.

859
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:17,989
Oh, come on.
I'm  still Aram Parisyan's attorney...

860
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:19,624
You told him to run, Mullin.

861
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:21,226
Why would he run?

862
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:22,794
You got the word of a convicted
felon that says, what?

863
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,195
He sent an e-mail?

864
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:25,964
He conspired to
cover up a murder.

865
00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:28,299
And Rezian's gonna
give up the cell phone

866
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:29,968
where he checked the e-mail.

867
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:32,470
Anyone could have borrowed
my client's phone.

868
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:35,907
Oh! Is that the defense
you're planning on using?

869
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:37,809
Because if that's the case,

870
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:39,844
I suggest you find
new counsel, Mr. Parisyan.

871
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:45,083
Who killed Craig Seward?

872
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:47,052
You don't have to
do this, Aram.

873
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,354
Oh, shut up, Tim!

874
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:52,957
It's over, man.

875
00:37:54,693 --> 00:37:55,760
I'm sorry.

876
00:38:06,305 --> 00:38:07,806
Stop him!

877
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:17,649
Get him out of here.

878
00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:19,584
All right, Cap!

879
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:21,186
Always wanted to
do that to a lawyer.

880
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:24,489
Nicely done.
Yeah.

881
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:25,990
All right.

882
00:38:26,058 --> 00:38:27,358
Let's get back.

883
00:38:27,426 --> 00:38:30,361
Wow. Mullin.
I know.

884
00:38:30,429 --> 00:38:32,497
Should've known
by the suit.

885
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:35,333
It turns out that
Aram Parisyan and his lawyer

886
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:37,168
have been friends
since they were kids.

887
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:39,337
Now, Timothy Mullin
and Craig Seward,

888
00:38:39,405 --> 00:38:40,805
they went to
law school together.

889
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:42,707
Mullin got a DUI
a little while back,

890
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,609
so he hired his old
schoolmate to represent him.

891
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:47,245
See, the thing is...
Mullin started talking about

892
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:49,614
the work he was doing
for Aram Parisyan.

893
00:38:49,682 --> 00:38:51,449
He said some things
he shouldn't have.

894
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:53,852
Seward started blackmailing him.

895
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:56,054
Mullin paid for a few months,

896
00:38:56,122 --> 00:38:58,857
Seward tried to up the payments,
then Mullin snapped.

897
00:38:58,924 --> 00:39:01,025
He called Aram Parisyan
to get rid of the body.

898
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:03,561
Parisyan just farmed out that
disposal out to Karl Rezian.

899
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:06,030
Now, Mullin, Parisyan, Rezian,

900
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:08,366
all these guys are in jail now.

901
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:10,135
They're not gonna bother
your family anymore.

902
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:14,606
Thank you.

903
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,308
Okay.

904
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:19,010
Um, listen, Dr. Ryan...

905
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:20,612
we owe you an apology.

906
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,780
Well, you did what
you're trained to do.

907
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:26,518
You're not wearing
your engagement ring.

908
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:29,621
Look, uh, this is
none of our business.

909
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:30,889
You know relationships.

910
00:39:30,956 --> 00:39:32,790
We know criminals.

911
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:35,360
Your fiancé got involved in some
stuff, made some mistakes...

912
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:36,694
You did what you're
trained to do,

913
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:38,229
and I'm going to do the same.

914
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:40,832
So, gentlemen, we have
a conflict of interest.

915
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,333
I'm terminating your therapy.

916
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:44,369
What?

917
00:39:44,436 --> 00:39:46,638
There's a group that
meets over in Hollywood

918
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:49,407
under Dr. Van Waals.

919
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:51,509
I'm going to refer you over to him.
Wait.

920
00:39:51,577 --> 00:39:54,012
Hold on.
Don't do this.

921
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,880
You're a good doctor.
Yeah.

922
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:58,550
We're-we're
metabolizing therapy.

923
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:00,852
We're doing better...

924
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:03,755
We like you.

925
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:05,356
Regardless.

926
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:07,258
We are where we are.

927
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:14,265
Okay, I'm sorry.

928
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,568
Travis said it,
I didn't say it.

929
00:40:16,635 --> 00:40:18,903
It's better that I know.

930
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:21,706
But I can't help you
if I can't trust you.

931
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:27,712
I wish you the best of luck.

932
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:40,888
You ready for this?

933
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,857
I don't really want to
break in a new therapist.

934
00:40:42,924 --> 00:40:44,992
Well, then, you shouldn't have
stolen that case file, Travis.

935
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,061
What are you talking about?
You wanted me to steal it.

936
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:49,430
I never said to steal it.
You didn't have to say anything...

937
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:51,298
I just said,
"Let's check in on Doctor..."

938
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,968
I do not care to!
Let's just... go.

939
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,269
You're the one that
wanted this divorce.

940
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:57,304
Do you hear that?

941
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,540
No, it is not my problem,
Susan, it is <i>your</i> problem!

942
00:40:59,608 --> 00:41:01,041
You want the divorce,
that's just fine!

943
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:02,810
But my lawyers are
gonna grind you into dust!

944
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,880
And I'm gonna take that dust and
put it in a jar on a shelf

945
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:08,549
next to a picture of my new
wife, who, in addition to being

946
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:10,551
younger and hotter than you,
is also gonna be dumber

947
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:12,219
so she's gonna go for
the freaking pre-nup!

948
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:15,456
Geez!

949
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:17,024
Hey.

950
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:18,292
Hi.

951
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,428
Welcome. You here for...?

952
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:21,929
Yeah. Yeah.

953
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:23,330
You, too.

954
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,665
And just in time, huh?

955
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:28,035
Well, actually, uh... no.

956
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:29,570
I'm Dr. Van Waals.

957
00:41:29,638 --> 00:41:30,805
I'm your new therapist, and...

958
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:32,540
the thing is...

959
00:41:32,607 --> 00:41:34,775
you weren't supposed to
hear any of that.

960
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,516
We've really need to get
Dr. Ryan to take us back.

961
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,717
Hells, yeah.
'Cause this guy is...

962
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:46,220
Okay.

963
00:41:46,288 --> 00:41:48,355
Please. Come into
the safe circle.

964
00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:55,963
Let's sit,

965
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:58,299
and let's find some inner peace

966
00:41:58,366 --> 00:41:59,967
with a deep, cleansing breath.
