00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,840
Hi, it's Charlie.
Leave a message.

2
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,040
Hi, Charlie. It's Carol
from the LA Temp Agency.

3
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,710
Listen, Dr. Batel's office needs you
for tomorrow. Is that okay?

4
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,940
Let me know. Bye.

5
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,910
Good morning, neighbor.

6
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,540
Hey.
Help yourself.

7
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,980
Thanks.
I was out of everything.

8
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,450
Aw, why do I even bother?

9
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,980
You know, Remy, I gave you
that key for emergencies.

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,580
Extreme emergencies.

11
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,310
It was.
I needed caffeine.

12
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,250
I don't know.
This is good. I'd even wear it.

13
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,710
Good, 'cause I've got to go.
I'm late for my first client.

14
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,610
But you stay,
have breakfast, take a shower.

15
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,780
Go through my drawers.

16
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,890
- Hey, Charlie.
- Morning.

17
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,030
- Are the boys ready?
- Dragon! Zorro!

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,240
Hey!
There are my boys.

19
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,670
Come on. Yay.

20
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,600
- See you later!
- Bye!

21
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,150
- Be good, boys!
- Whoa! Slow down!

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,940
"Romance is in the air today.

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,420
No one can resist
your obvious charms. "

24
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,310
Well, Otis, your horoscope
seems accurate.

25
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,030
Stop it.
Come on.

26
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,020
Let's read mine.
Okay.

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,330
"Do not leave your house today. "
Too late.

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,230
"And stop looking so hard.
Love is right in front of you. "

29
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,430
Hey.
What's wrong?

30
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,290
I ordered a nonfat latte.
I can taste the fat.

31
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,920
I would be happy
to change it for you, sir.

32
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,060
Can't you even make a friggin' cup
of coffee? I can taste the fat.

33
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,550
How hard it is to make
a friggin' cup of coffee?

34
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,300
I can make another one
for you if you'd like. I'd be happy

35
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,260
- to exchange it for you, sir.
- Hello? It's okay.

36
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,440
- You've done enough, thanks.
- I'm sorry.

37
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,210
Karma.

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,670
- Have a good one.
- Thanks, girl!

39
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,080
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

40
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,540
Hi.

41
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,940
Hi.

42
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,710
I don't know how
to read tarot cards.

43
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,960
- Why am I in the cards?
- Come on, just try.

44
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,820
Okay, well, this crazy old lady
keeps coming up.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,500
The knight
in shining armor.

46
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,530
- Mmm! That's mine.
- No no no. What?

47
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,050
- I saw this guy twice today.
- That guy?

48
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,030
Two times in one day.
That's got to be a sign, right?

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,820
Mm, a sign.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah, okay. What did he say
when you talked to him?

51
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,370
I didn't talk to him.

52
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,210
Well, are you sure
he saw you?

53
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,470
Yeah!
I mean, I think so.

54
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,330
Okay, honey,
we're worried about you

55
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,210
because you're turning
into a little bit of a freak.

56
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,640
Yeah, we think
it's from not having sex.

57
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,240
- Exactly.
- Look, just because...

58
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,100
I haven't been in
a relationship in a while

59
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,880
doesn't mean
I'm miserable.

60
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,410
I just want a sweet guy,

61
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,220
you know, a guy
who's strong but still...

62
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,590
...opens a door
once in a while.

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,450
And who notices
things and...

64
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,920
you know, maybe
makes a difference.

65
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,590
Maybe he completes you.

66
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,170
You complete me.

67
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,120
Sorry.

68
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,270
Dr. Batel's office.
Hi, Mrs. Reynolds.

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,140
- Go to Grandma's, tell her
I'll be home late.

70
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,610
- I still have stitches to do...
- Yeah, can you please hold?

71
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,070
I'll see you
at home.

72
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,070
You know what? You go ahead.
I can do that for you.

73
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,070
- Thank you, Charlie. You're a doll.
- No problem.

74
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey, George.

75
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,970
- How're you doing, Charlie?
- Good.

76
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,800
- What do you got there?
- The doctor asked me

77
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,810
to bring it from home.

78
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,020
Whew! Okay!

79
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,190
All right. The doctor
will be right with you.

80
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,830
- Thank you.
- ? Come on, dive into the stove...?

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,360
We're here!

82
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,870
Thank God
you guys are here.

83
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,560
I am down two girls
tonight. Here.

84
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,430
- Sorry, that's all I got left.
- Sweet.

85
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,030
Wow. You know, I love that I am
now comfortable enough with my sexuality

86
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,140
- to wear something like this, you know?
- Looks good on you.

87
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,680
- Hey, what's up?
- Take off the apron now.

88
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,380
- Sorry.
- Where do we start?

89
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,080
Okay, hand out
these shrimp balls.

90
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,110
There has got to be
a better name for those.

91
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,020
- I don't think it's that bad of a name.
- What's wrong with the name?

92
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,750
- Oh my God, that's him.
- Who? Who?

93
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,020
The guy I ran into.
He's here.

94
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,810
- Where?
- What?

95
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,750
That is three times in two days.
What are the chances of that?

96
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,320
- Um, like, none.
- That's Dr. Fields.

97
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,560
This is his party. He just moved
back from San Francisco.

98
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,930
Well, you're right.
He is hot.

100
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,460
- Here's the best part.

101
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,250
The guy then goes
into cardiac arrest,

102
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,790
Kevin performs CPR
on the guy,

103
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,150
saves his life again.

104
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,000
God.
Disgusting, isn't he?

105
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,630
No, you are amazing.

106
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,840
Yeah.

107
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,280
Excuse me?

108
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,970
W- wait wait wait.
What do we have there?

109
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,140
Oh, um, balls.

110
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,200
Shrimp balls.

111
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
Shrimp in...

112
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,740
...balls.

113
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,450
I'm sorry,

114
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,720
but we're not really
into fish genitalia.

115
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,820
Yeah, okay.

116
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,490
Was she really listening
to our conversation?

117
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,880
Excuse me.

118
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,620
Wait a second.

119
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,450
So I know two things
about you... you work in catering,

120
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,290
and you have a lot of dogs.

121
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,350
Oh, that... no.

122
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,870
I'm a dog walker.

123
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,760
I'm not some crazy dog-lady
with 12,000 dogs.

124
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,300
- That's why.
- And I'm sorry about before.

125
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,170
I didn't mean
to be eavesdropping.

126
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,690
Well, you're right.
You shouldn't have.

127
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,700
You should have stayed
and talked to me.

128
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,130
Well, your girlfriend
seemed pretty offended.

129
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,470
Oh no, that's...
that's not my girlfriend.

130
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,330
I- I don't have a...
I'm sing...

131
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,380
I don't have
a girlfriend.

132
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,210
What?

133
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,110
Nothing.

134
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,380
Nothing. I'm Charlie.
Charlotte, but Charlie.

135
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,510
Well, I'm... I'm Kevin.

136
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,350
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

137
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,510
What? What does
"uh-oh" mean?

138
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,680
It looks like someone else
is mowing your lawn, Fiona.

139
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,340
I'm gonna go
destroy these.

140
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,130
Excuse me.
I'll see you guys.

141
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,830
My shoes
are killing me

142
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,840
which means
they must look fabulous.

143
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,440
Can I get you anything?

144
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,200
One of him on a platter.

145
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,900
Such a waste.

146
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,730
What's a waste?

147
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,240
You didn't know?

148
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,100
Kevin's gay.

149
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,120
- What?
- Yeah.

150
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,780
That's Kit, the groom.

151
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,190
Or maybe he's the bride.
I can't remember

152
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,880
which one's the top
and which one's the bottom.

153
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,850
Yeah, they're getting married
next Christmas in Maui.

154
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,390
I didn't get that vibe.

155
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,420
Trust me.

156
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,190
Thanks.

157
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,900
Look at
that dude's arms!

158
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,770
I used to have
such good gaydar.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,890
You're home.
Thank God.

160
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,190
- I'm exhausted.
- What did you do today?

161
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,990
- Hi, it's Charlie. Leave a message.
- Went to the post office.

162
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
Hi, Charlie.

163
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,490
- This is Kevin Fields.
- That's him.

164
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,290
I don't know if you remember me
from the party the other night,

165
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,860
but I was just calling
to see if,

166
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,970
maybe... maybe you wanted
to walk my dog.

167
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,440
What? No!

168
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,100
Hang up the phone.

169
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,000
No, actually, you can't,
because I don't have a dog.

170
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,050
So maybe you could
walk me.

171
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,910
Hang it up.

172
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,780
All right, you know,
I'm-I'm gonna go now.

173
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,810
Call me at 555-0118
and ask for Dr. Fields.

174
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,680
Okay, thanks. Bye.

175
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,950
Oh man, that was...
that was horrible.

176
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,590
Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath
for a callback on that.

177
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,990
Yeah, she'll call me back
if she wants to walk an idiot.

178
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,850
Yeah, I'm not going
to disagree with you.

179
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,240
So takeout
or raid your fridge?

180
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,760
Here we go.

181
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,890
Take it easy, Lilly.

182
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,690
Easy.

183
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,230
Hi.

184
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,500
You never called me back so I figured
I would bring the coffee to you.

185
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Thanks.

186
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,140
Look, I think you're
a really nice guy and everything,

187
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,370
but I don't know why
you called me.

188
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,110
- Hmm?
- I'm a woman.

189
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,510
Yeah, I love that fact.

190
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,480
Have you ever been
with a woman?

191
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,610
Excuse me?

192
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,950
I mean, have you only
ever been with men?

193
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,420
Men?
What are you talking...

194
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,360
whoa whoa whoa.
Wait a minute, I'm not gay.

195
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,550
- You're not?
- No.

196
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,550
No, I like women.
Lots of... no, not lots of women,

197
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,120
but you know what I mean.

198
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,260
Why did you think
I was gay?

199
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,690
Awkward.

200
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,120
Okay, I got to go now.

201
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,070
Wait wait.
Wait wait wait.

202
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,100
Okay, I'll prove to you
that I'm not gay.

203
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,900
Let me take you out on Friday night.
We'll watch the playoffs,

204
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,370
I'll order a pizza,
I'll completely ignore you.

205
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,900
Give me one good reason.

206
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,670
'Cause I'm different.

207
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,230
Really?

208
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,280
Okay, what color
are my eyes?

209
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,330
Well, at first glance,
your eyes are brown.

210
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,880
But when the light hits them
they change to amber.

211
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,680
And if you look really closely around the
iris the color is pure honey.

212
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,620
But when you look
into the sun

213
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,920
they almost look green.

214
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,080
That's my favorite.

215
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,060
How did I do?

216
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,930
I would've settled
for brown.

217
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
- Okay!
- Peanut, let go!

218
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,220
Off! Off!

219
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,810
I'm sorry he bit you.

220
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,170
I mean, they all have their shots
so it should be fine.

221
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,810
Seriously, don't worry about it.
It barely broke the skin.

222
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,770
- Outside.
- Did you just move in or something?

223
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,100
No, I've been here
a year and a half.

224
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,700
Nice place.

225
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,000
I should have some hydrogen peroxide
around here somewhere.

226
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,540
What is all this stuff?

227
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,530
I'm a yoga instructor.

228
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,750
- This?
- And a Little League coach.

229
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,310
And a dog walker
and a caterer.

230
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,180
I told you I'm a temp.

231
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,610
That is not true.
She is an incredibly talented artist.

232
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,840
- Remy! Remy!
- I mean, look at her sketchbook.

233
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,350
- She hides it right under there.
- Remy!

234
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,640
What?

235
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,550
He's not...

236
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,390
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

237
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,270
Found it!

238
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,460
So you're an artist, too?

239
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,570
I like to dabble
in a lot of different things.

240
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,470
I mean, life's too short
to live the same day twice, right?

241
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,400
Yeah. That's a good
philosophy to live by.

242
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,570
My dad always used
to say that. Come on.

243
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,130
- Used to?
- Yeah,

244
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,500
- my parents died when I was little.
- I'm sorry.

245
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,840
That's okay.
It was a really long time ago.

246
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,810
- You ready?
- Yeah... I mean,

247
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,710
it's a little embarrassing.
I'm the doctor.

248
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,850
I'm the one who's supposed
to look at the... ah! Ow!

249
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,940
- Oh my God. I'm sorry!
- I'm just kidding.

250
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,640
I never get to do that.

251
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,440
Okay, because the cut is,
like, three inches higher.

252
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,110
Sorry.

253
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,480
- Do you need my phone?
- No thanks.

254
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,690
It's just my mom. And it's only
her second page of the day.

255
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,390
She's just getting started.

256
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,030
- Well, you're all set.
- Thank you.

257
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,760
So, do you think...

258
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,030
we could do this again sometime,
maybe without the biting?

259
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,630
Yeah, that would be nice.

260
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,770
- Heard from Kevin yet?
- Not yet. I've paged him.

261
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,160
Would you page
him again?

262
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,900
- Good morning, Stan.
- Good morning.

263
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,710
- You're in a good mood.
- The last time the network executives

264
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,210
came to my dressing room
I got my own show and a big fat raise.

265
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,810
- Yeah and I had to start kissing your...
- Viola Fields? Oh my God!

266
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,610
It is such an honor
to meet you.

267
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,080
Thank you, darling.

268
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,370
Would you mind
just signing this autograph?

269
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,280
For my grandmother.

270
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,480
I'd love to.

271
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,350
You know what else
I'd love?

272
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,950
I'd love you to get me a latte.
Do you mind?

273
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,090
- Okay.
- Thanks, hon.

274
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,530
Hi, guys.
How are you?

275
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,520
That woman is a legend.

276
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,860
Shouldn't you be
getting the latte?

277
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,520
I just can't believe
they picked me to replace her.

278
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,800
Shit!

279
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,730
I- I've been replaced?

280
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,270
I'm so sorry, Viola.

281
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,810
Psst!
I'm fine.

282
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,810
I mean, you've had
an amazing career, Viola.

283
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,780
It's just that we're trying to appeal
to a younger demographic.

284
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,980
I'm fine.

285
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,720
God damn!
Get my manager on the phone!

286
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,710
And then I'm gonna call
the head of the...

287
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,590
Uh, we're on in two minutes.

288
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,010
- Okay.
- Will you get her to come?

289
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,220
- Please!
- Okay, she'll be ready.

290
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,230
I'm ready.

291
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,600
?... love got jeans
and a tee?

292
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,210
- Are you okay?
- I'm great.

293
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,130
Hey, I've had
a great run.

294
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,910
I've done exclusives
with Kissinger, the Dalai Lama,

295
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,340
Muhammad Ali...

296
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,270
four sitting presidents...

297
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,940
three of them hit on me.

298
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,110
Five Emmys!

299
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,450
Now I'm being replaced
by a young thing

300
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,050
whose grandmother
loves me.

301
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,920
You know what
I'm gonna do?

302
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,540
I'm gonna finish out
my contract

303
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,420
and I'm gonna leave this show
with my dignity intact.

304
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,180
Okay, coming back
from commercial.

305
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,550
Three, cue announcer.

306
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,710
Today on "Public Intimacy,"

307
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,430
pop singing sensation
Tanya Murphy.

308
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,490
And now we're live
with Viola Fields.

309
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,130
Four, three, two...

310
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,630
Well, that was
very nice.

311
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,760
My goodness, you have a big voice
for such a tiny girl.

312
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,300
You're gonna miss
Viola Fields.

313
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,760
Have you always
been a singer?

314
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,630
Ever since I was
a child.

315
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,460
I would sing
in school plays, choirs.

316
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,080
- How old are you?
- I'll be 17 next month.

317
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,240
W- what do you do for fun?

318
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,680
I love watching
really old movies.

319
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,110
- They're my favorite.
- Really? Really, which ones?

320
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,940
Well, "Grease"
and "Grease II."

321
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,680
"Benji. "
I love "Benji. "

322
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,640
"Free Willy," um...

323
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,180
"Legally Blonde,"

324
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,580
"The Little Mermaid. "

325
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,490
- Oh.
- Yeah... oh, I know.

326
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,530
You ever read
a newspaper?

327
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,000
Newspaper?

328
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,430
Viola, the girl
has stars on her nipples.

329
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,060
I don't have
much time for that.

330
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,400
So basically, you have absolutely
no idea what's going on in the world?

331
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,360
- I...
- And yet, you've sold

332
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,930
over five million albums... CDs,
to millions of kids

333
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,140
- who listen to your insipid lyrics.
- What is she doing?

334
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,910
"You want to know me,
look in my makeup bag. "

335
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,210
You're influencing
an entire generation of kids

336
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,080
who won't know how
to think straight,

337
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,940
or vote for a president,

338
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,670
or remember the significance
of Roe versus Wade.

339
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,180
I don't support
boxing as a sport.

340
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,880
I think
it's too violent.

341
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,960
Y'all better get that
little girl out of there.

342
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,590
- Holy crap!
- Get us off the air!

343
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,660
- Quick!
- Go to commercial! Go to commercial!

344
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,530
Crazy bitch!
Get off me!

345
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,660
- Cut! Cut! Put in the Bow Flex tape!
- Get her off!

346
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,430
Juice Man, something!

347
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,490
I don't support
boxing as a sport.

348
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,110
I think
it's too violent.

349
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,440
I wanted you to take one last look
at the old Viola.

350
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,480
Oh, thank God
I've changed.

351
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,250
Yes.

352
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,990
Well, just remember

353
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,520
the breakdown was
only a few months ago

354
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,210
so take it nice
and slow out there.

355
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,940
No stress.

356
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,870
Absolutely.

357
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,610
In fact, I'm going
to take a vacation.

358
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,970
I've been promising my son
we'd go to Africa

359
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,710
since he was a little boy.

360
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,050
And I finally have
the time.

361
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,590
That's wonderful.

362
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,320
Not to worry,

363
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm in complete control.

364
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,450
Ruby! Ruby,
my dear old friend.

365
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,550
I'm so happy
to see you.

366
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,620
Well, good,
they still have you medicated.

367
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,820
Ruby, I figured it out.

368
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,330
- Life, I mean.
- Oh, this ought to be good.

369
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,160
It's not about how many celebrities
I interview or what my ratings are.

370
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,040
- It's about relationships and family.

371
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,270
Me and my son.

372
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,390
I just spoke to Kevin.

373
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,770
- Did you get the tickets?
- Sure did. Right here.

374
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,930
He's going
to be so surprised.

375
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,300
Yeah, the three of you
should have a good time.

376
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,130
- Three?
- Yeah, you, Kevin

377
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,520
- and his new girlfriend.
- New girlfriend?

378
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,810
That's a lovely surprise.

379
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,280
Is it?

380
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,150
Well, I mean,
it can't be too serious.

381
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,280
I've only been away
a few months.

382
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,490
Well, that's
the end of it.

383
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,560
Where do you want me
to put this?

384
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,430
Under the bed.

385
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,360
You sure you don't want me
to put it by the door so you can

386
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,440
make a quick escape to the apartment you
still have for some reason?

387
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,700
Now come on. You agreed to me
subletting my apartment.

388
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,910
I would have agreed to anything
to get you to move in here.

389
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,110
These are great.
Are they new?

390
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,640
Oh, no!
You can't look at those!

391
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,570
- 'Cause they're not finished yet.
- Sorry.

392
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,300
- Okay? Please?
- Okay.

393
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,940
Here, I'll put them back.

394
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,410
I forgot to tell you, we're having lunch
with my mom tomorrow.

395
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,050
Lt'll be fine.
I promise.

396
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,860
You want
to take a shower?

397
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,870
Yeah! Okay!

398
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,140
All right, so tell me
about your dad.

399
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,860
Well, he died
when I was two.

400
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,570
But that was just
her first husband.

401
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,830
At the time she was
a freelance journalist

402
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,070
and then she married this guy
who was a network exec

403
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,930
and got her her first
on-air break,

404
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,880
but divorced him
for Alec Wrigley.

405
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,610
Wait, the actor?
I thought he was...

406
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,480
He was.
It lasted about two years

407
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,750
till she threw him out for sleeping
with her second husband.

408
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,610
Wait, how many times
has she been married?

409
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,150
- Well, four.
- Wow.

410
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,680
But, you know, her career
was always the main thing.

411
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,750
She just lived for it.
Well, her career and me, of course.

412
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,180
And, basically,
now I'm all she's got.

413
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,460
Here we are.

414
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,160
Oh, no.

415
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,620
Playing dress-up,
are we?

416
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,110
- Shut up. Is that the Dalai Lama?
- Yeah.

417
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,870
- Oh my God, That can't be real.
- It is.

418
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,980
Did you know
all these people?

419
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,840
- Some of them.
- Kevin!

420
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,710
- Look at you, all handsome.
- Ruby!

421
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,550
Good to see you.

422
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,190
Yeah, you too.

423
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,650
Now, forget about
my mother.

424
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,730
This is the woman you need
to get through. Charlie, this is Ruby.

425
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,720
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure's mine.

426
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,590
Excuse us.
I've got to talk to him about a rash.

427
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,300
You're bringing a girl home
to meet your mother now?

428
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,960
Yeah, Ruby, I am.

429
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,230
The women is fresh off
the funny farm.

430
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,570
I mean, why don't you
come back, let's say... next spring?

431
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,510
The trees
will be blooming.

432
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,040
- It'll be so beautiful. She'll love it.
- How is she?

433
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,710
She's good.
The first thing she did

434
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,110
when she got home was make me
lock up all the booze.

435
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,970
It's Oprah!

436
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,280
Oprah!

437
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,870
Yeah, Oprah.

438
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,910
There's one in there
with the cast from "Good Times" too.

439
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,320
So how big is this place?

440
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,690
About four acres.
There's a tennis court,

441
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,620
two swimming pools,
indoor and outdoor... it's kind of crazy.

442
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,090
What?
No helicopter pad?

443
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,350
Oh, no.
There's one out back.

444
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,880
I'm kidding.

445
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,250
Kevin!

446
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,050
I've missed you
so much!

447
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,160
I promise I'll never
leave you again.

448
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,590
Oh my God, Mom.
Look at you. You look fantastic.

449
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,270
- It's just something I threw together.
- Come here.

450
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,730
- What?
- I want to introduce you to someone.

451
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,440
- Charlie. Mom.
- Kevin.

452
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,000
Charlie, this is Mom.

453
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,530
Mom, Charlie.

454
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,830
Oh, hi.

455
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,760
I'd love to just be able
to think of it and make it.

456
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,110
I must have spent
the last 30 years

457
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,910
looking for the perfect
little black...

458
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,780
- Cocktail dress.
... cocktail dress. Yes.

459
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,340
I know.

460
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,450
Well, it doesn't matter. You could
wear anything with your figure.

461
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,680
- I mean, you look amazing.
- Oh, honey, thanks.

462
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,510
Listen, when you're my age,
if ain't broke, you fix it before it is.

463
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,030
Why the question mark?

464
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,830
Oh, 'cause
I just don't know.

465
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,040
I love your jewelry.

466
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,910
- Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.
- I love that.

467
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,410
- I like it... the earth tones.
- It's fantastic.

468
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,510
- Where did you get this from?
- My first husband.

469
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,150
That's Kevin's father. He gave it to me
when we were in Peru.

470
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,010
- It's very earthy.
- It's like the dress,

471
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,540
very earthy.

472
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,250
I just think it's wonderful
that you've tried so many temp jobs.

473
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,410
Think of all
the experiences you have.

474
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,530
You've been
so quiet, Kevin.

475
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,460
Well, it's kind of hard to get
a word in edgewise with you two.

476
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,030
Is he great,
or what?

477
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,890
I tell you too,
that's a little scary.

478
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,900
Enjoy it while you can.

479
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,460
Here you go,
some more coffee.

480
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,990
Actually, I was a little nervous
about the two of you meeting.

481
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,360
- Really?
- Why?

482
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,060
Well, 'cause it's
important to me.

483
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,730
Mom, you're the most
amazing woman I've ever known.

484
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,370
And, Charlie,
I've never met anyone like you.

485
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,580
You're real,
you're honest.

486
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,070
And although we've only
known each other a few months,

487
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,540
I- I feel like
I've known you forever.

488
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,440
I guess what I'm
trying to say here...

489
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,940
is what are you doing
for the rest of your life?

490
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,320
What?

491
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,280
Oh my God!

492
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,930
Charlie, will you
marry me?

493
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,300
It's...
it's too sudden.

494
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,570
- She's in shock.
- No!

495
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,300
- I mean, I am, but...
- Yes!

496
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,260
Seriously?

497
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,100
Seriously.

498
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,760
No no. Say "no. "

499
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,000
Yes. Yes!

500
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,470
Yeah!

501
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,450
I'm so happy for you.

502
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,310
- Congratulations!
- Oh my God. I can't believe this.

503
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,720
I am so happy for you.

504
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,380
Congratulations!
I'm so pleased

505
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,750
that you're going to be
my daughter-in-law.

506
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,850
Congratulations.

507
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,250
- I can't believe this.
- I'm so happy for you.

508
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,520
- Thank you!
- You're going to need a moment alone.

509
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,090
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

510
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,400
Shit!

511
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,970
Medicine.

512
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,840
Let's see.

513
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,370
No.

514
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,430
What's... ah!

515
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,240
14% alcohol!

516
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,440
- You are so crazy! Oh my God!
- I almost forgot.

517
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,810
I've been carrying this around for two
weeks waiting for the perfect moment.

518
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,970
I can't believe this
turned out to be it.

519
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,590
- Kevin.
- Try it on.

520
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,660
It is the perfect moment.

521
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,430
Maybe you should go
check on your mom.

522
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,260
She's fine. She's probably
calling all of our relatives.

523
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,090
Holy Spirit...

524
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,570
surround me with light.

525
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,460
Please rid me
of my negative karma

526
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,230
and my wickedness.

527
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,560
Please help me be
a better person.

528
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,480
I could just kill
that dog-walking slut!

529
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,640
Of course.

530
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,610
She's pregnant.

531
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,780
So, goodness.
That was a lot to take in at teatime.

532
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,240
- You're telling me.
- I had no idea

533
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,050
that you guys
were so serious.

534
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,980
Kevin, you never
mentioned anything.

535
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,380
- Mom.
- Here's what I want to say.

536
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,320
It's wonderful
being in love.

537
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,100
But I don't think marriage is
the best solution to a thing like this.

538
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,860
Well, you know nowadays
a girl has so many alternatives

539
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,200
to getting married...
there's adoption, abortion,

540
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,390
- lesbianism... Hmm?
- Whoa, Mom!

541
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,320
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I mean, it's so sudden

542
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,460
I have to assume
there's a pressing reason.

543
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,430
Oh oh, no.

544
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,160
Charlie's not pregnant.

545
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,640
Call me old-fashioned,

546
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,980
marriage is a sacred union

547
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,340
that should only be entered into
with the utmost care.

548
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,510
Weren't you married
four times?

549
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,810
Yes, dear.

550
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,070
Which would make me an expert,
don't you think?

551
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,220
Excuse me.

552
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,540
It's the hospital.
I'll be right back.

553
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,230
Okay.

554
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,090
You want me to go
with you?

555
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,260
No, stay right there.

556
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,700
You know, this is as sudden
for me as it is for you.

557
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,570
It's too sudden, right?

558
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,270
You think?

559
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,630
Yeah.

560
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,400
Really?

561
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,370
I mean, what's the rush?
It's not like the old days

562
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,190
where you had to get married
and have kids,

563
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,250
and have it all figured out
by the time you were 21.

564
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,190
- Exactly.
- We have options now.

565
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,180
And I've always liked
having my options, you know?

566
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,450
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

567
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,990
This is so... big.

568
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,250
What am I...
what am I doing?

569
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,800
I love Kevin.

570
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,690
I want to spend the rest
of my life with him.

571
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh my God!
I'm getting married!

572
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,940
Ruby!

573
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,710
Ruby, I need a bottle of champagne.
We're going to celebrate.

574
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,240
May I have the key
to the liquor cabinet please?

575
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,680
What key?

576
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,940
The key, Ruby.

577
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,370
Key?
There's no key.

578
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,240
Ruby, give me the key.

579
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,850
You want to take this
outside?

580
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,350
Bring me the key.

581
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,690
And fix your hair.

582
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,810
You look like
a damned cockatoo.

583
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,800
She is such
a fabulous assistant.

584
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,640
Hey, do you think
your mother liked me?

585
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,770
Of course. Why?

586
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,340
I don't know, because she called me
a pregnant lesbian?

587
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,980
I'm sure she meant that
as a compliment.

588
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,320
Trust me.
She loved you.

589
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,750
They're gone?

590
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,320
I'll just put this baby
back to bed, okay?

591
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,990
My son
the brilliant surgeon

592
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,860
is gonna marry a temp.

593
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,490
Gonna need something
stronger than this.

594
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,800
Where's that martini?

595
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,400
Hooch will not solve
your problems.

596
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,540
She's going to destroy him.

597
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,480
It is so clear.

598
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,980
She's got no money,
no career goals.

599
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,780
She was just waiting
for a rich innocent

600
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,280
to step right
in her path.

601
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,610
Kevin's
smarter than that.

602
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,440
Come on,
you raised him well.

603
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,980
He's a good boy.

604
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,970
But he's a man.
That's the problem.

605
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,950
The only time they think straight
is when they have an erection,

606
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,990
and it's usually pointed
right at the trampiest woman.

607
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,190
You talking about
her or you?

608
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,220
Look, there's nothing
you can do.

609
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,560
Just let it go.

610
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,920
You know what you need?
A project.

611
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,450
Or another husband.

612
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,690
You know, why don't you
marry another gay guy?

613
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,220
That was fun.

614
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,190
You know, you're right.

615
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,000
I do need a project.

616
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,670
And I have
the perfect one.

617
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,700
I am going
to save my son.

618
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,740
Here.

619
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,830
- What?
- You go use those old contacts of yours

620
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,530
to get all the information you can
about that little pimp.

621
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,940
And exactly what do you
expect to find?

622
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,000
Everybody's got
a past, honey.

623
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,040
Find something.

624
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,210
And I'm going to open up
the Montecito house

625
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,810
and get a party planner.

626
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,710
I'm going to give them
an engagement party.

627
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,880
And then what?
Lock her in the basement?

628
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,010
When he sees how out of place
she is in his world,

629
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,310
it's gonna be over.

630
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,850
This will end badly.

631
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,880
Get me another one
of those.

632
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,430
Is it me, or is each house
you take me to bigger than the last?

633
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,980
But I thought your mom
said this was a barbecue.

634
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,560
Oh my God. It looks like she's invited
everyone I've ever known.

635
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,510
And they're all
in black tie.

636
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,390
There's my mom.
Mom!

637
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,620
Darlings!
How was the trip?

638
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,680
- Welcome.
- I'm sorry.

639
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,780
- I didn't know this was a formal party.
- Well, that's because

640
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,880
I have something for you.
I bought you a new dress.

641
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,630
Oh, see?
There's a dress upstairs.

642
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,790
- Thank you.
- Besides, you look great in anything.

643
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,630
Exactly. You always look
so clean and shiny.

644
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,160
Kevin, your tuxedo
is upstairs in your room.

645
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,670
But first I want you to meet
some friends. Come.

646
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,670
- Prince Amir.
- Can I change first?

647
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,160
- This is Sarah. Kevin.
- You know Kevin.

648
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,970
And this is Charlie.
She's a temp.

649
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,500
Charlie, this is the man that introduced the
euro to the global market.

650
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,180
- Mr. Prime Minister.
- Viola.

651
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,780
Marie. You know my son,
but this is Charlie.

652
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,620
- Very good to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

653
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,780
- She's a temp.
- Yeah.

654
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,220
I worked in a bank once.

655
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,310
Look! There's
the Poet Laureate and...

656
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,610
Charlie, first I want you to meet
the Secretary of Commerce.

657
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,180
Viola, please let me
change first.

658
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,210
I don't want to meet her
in my flip-flops.

659
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,530
Of course, of course. Ruby, would
you show Charlie to the guest room?

660
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,060
- Come on, Charlie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

661
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,270
Wow!

662
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,900
Oh my...

663
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,200
it's vintage.

664
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,430
Fiona.

665
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,360
- You look stunning.
- Thank you. So do you.

666
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,300
My goodness.

667
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,430
Kevin just went up
to his old room.

668
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,980
- Why don't you go say hello to him?
- I'd love to.

669
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,050
Good girl.

670
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,360
Fiona, what are you doing here?
I'm dressing.

671
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,790
Why don't you let me give you
a hand with that?

672
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,460
Give it up, Fiona.

673
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,530
You know, you and I had
a very strong bond once.

674
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,730
No, you and I had
very strong drinks once.

675
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,200
That's not true.

676
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,240
Kiss me. I'll remind you
how good it was.

677
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,510
What are you doing?

678
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,170
I'm engaged.
I'm happy.

679
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,380
It's gonna fit!

680
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,380
Why did she get me
such a small dress?

681
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,720
I have two asses.

682
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,510
It'll fit.
There we go.

683
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,040
Okay.

684
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,710
Okay! Okay!

685
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,260
What is it about her
that's so special?

686
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,430
I don't know but I plan on spending
the rest of my life finding out.

687
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,990
Kevin!

688
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,200
God! Men in love
are really hot.

689
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,700
Fiona!

690
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,570
Oops!

691
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:39,070
I was just giving Kevin
a congratulatory kiss.

692
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,660
Don't worry.

693
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,280
Why would I worry?
He's gay, right?

694
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,580
Charlie!

695
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,690
Charlie, that was not
what it looked like.

696
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,250
I'm going home.

697
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,190
I've destroyed
priceless couture.

698
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:09,080
I embarrassed myself
in front of 70% of the world's royalty.

699
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,940
I forgot, yeah!

700
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,050
I just caught you making out
with your ex-girlfriend.

701
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,910
Charlie, let me explain.

702
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,360
Ugh!
It doesn't matter.

703
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,090
I can't do this.

704
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,040
I don't belong here,
Kevin.

705
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,930
And if I don't belong here
then maybe we don't...

706
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,470
Hey hey hey.
Listen to me.

707
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,630
It's you and me now.

708
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,230
This isn't my world anymore.

709
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,400
You're my world.

710
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,900
Okay?

711
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,380
Now let's get the hell out of here.
I'm taking you home.

712
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,740
Okay.

713
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,720
Let me try and get out
of this dress and then...

714
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,090
Okay, see you
downstairs.

715
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,130
Do you like it?

716
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,730
Yeah, it's great.

717
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,920
I'm so glad you
finally decided to do it.

718
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,100
I don't know. I just woke up today
and it just felt like home.

719
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,360
I'm gonna do
all three walls.

720
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,970
You know, I think it's time
to take a break.

721
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,240
Wait!

722
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,440
- Wait a minute.
- Whoo whoo whoo!

723
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,070
I can't let it dry
too much.

724
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,980
Oh God!

725
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,040
Are we getting out of bed
today, "Camille"?

726
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,240
What for?

727
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,440
I could die
and nobody would care.

728
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,870
I would.

729
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,490
You promised me
a face-lift.

730
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,110
Sit down, Ruby.
Sit with me, hold my hand.

731
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,890
Have you got anything
on the girl yet?

732
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,750
Nothing. Nada.

733
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,590
No criminal record.
No debt.

734
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,820
Good grades. Went to design school.
And then a string of odd jobs.

735
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,420
Isn't that exactly what
somebody with a past does?

736
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,760
What about drugs?
What about promiscuity?

737
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,620
She's had fewer lovers
in her entire life

738
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,170
than you did
at closing day of Woodstock.

739
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,960
Well, find something.

740
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,570
Well, I guess if I had
a hair sample maybe I could take it

741
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,600
- to my little crime lab and...
- Perfect.

742
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,410
I'll get to work on it.

743
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,970
Listen to me.
There is nothing.

744
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,970
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe she's a good girl?

745
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,140
Don't joke.

746
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,640
I would like to speak to that woman
who got back from the loony bin.

747
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,320
Is she around?

748
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,250
Because you are taking me
for a spin in the crazy mobile.

749
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,750
Ruby, Ruby.

750
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,250
Everybody knows that when
a woman marries a man

751
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,120
she marries his mother
too, right?

752
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,920
What if I drive her crazy?

753
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,580
Okay, now you're
foaming at the mouth.

754
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,290
Charlie and Kevin's house.

755
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,230
I forgot you live there.

756
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,740
I didn't realize that you
had already moved in.

757
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,540
Kevin, stop it. I'm on the phone
with your mother! I'm sorry, Viola.

758
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,810
The slut's practically
fornicating with him!

759
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,210
- Stop it!
- I don't blame her.

760
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,680
That boy's a fine piece of ass.

761
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:52,140
Hold on, Viola.
He's... stop it! Right here.

762
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,040
Actually, Charlie,
the reason I'm calling

763
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,680
is I wondered if you'd
like to have lunch next week.

764
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,220
- Really?
- How would Tuesday work for you?

765
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,790
Yeah,
Tuesday's perfect!

766
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,650
Listen, Viola, I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now,

767
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,620
but Tuesday's fine.

768
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,350
Yeah, me too.

769
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,520
- Lots to do!
- Okay, bye!

770
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,500
I'll go get the vodka.

771
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,700
It's good to see you.

772
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,870
There she is.

773
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,320
Charlotte.

774
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,560
Hi. I'm going to have
the garden salad

775
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,450
and the low-cal Chinese dressing
and a decaf iced tea.

776
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,090
- And you, miss?
- I'll just have a...

777
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:56,390
cheeseburger
with fries and a soda.

778
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,930
- All right.
- Okay.

779
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,660
You continue
to surprise me.

780
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,660
Aren't you worried about fitting
in your wedding dress?

781
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,530
Well, I mean, I'm making the dress
to fit my body,

782
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,070
not the other way
around.

783
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,910
Whoa. I wish I had been
that confident when I got married.

784
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,540
I'll tell you one thing
you're gonna have that I never did,

785
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,510
a stupendous wedding.

786
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,240
And it's important that we
book the church right away.

787
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,280
I always thought
that Kevin looked like Jesus

788
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,110
in the cathedral down
on Second Street. Mmm.

789
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,240
Actually, we were thinking
of having...

790
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,410
a non-denominational
service,

791
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,280
being that I'm more spiritual
than religious.

792
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,090
What about my place then?

793
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,420
That way we don't even
need to book a location.

794
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,630
And Kevin was born there
and grew up there.

795
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,290
It would mean
so much to him. I'll plan it all.

796
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,830
We'll have that marvelous band
that the Swansons' had at their wedding.

797
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,760
And a divine cake.
Oh, honey!

798
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:53,790
No no no!
Tsk tsk tsk!

799
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,940
Chewing,
it's a disgusting habit.

800
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,670
Hold still.
I've gotta... gotta...

801
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:00,240
- There! Got it!
- Ow!

802
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:03,430
Thanks...

803
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,710
What do you think
about peach?

804
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,540
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

805
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,470
Can I get another salad
without the nuts?

806
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,440
- I have allergies.
- Okay.

807
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,200
I'm allergic to nuts,
and eggs, and shellfish,

808
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,680
and blueberries.
... and soy.

809
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,050
It's amazing you've been able
to nourish yourself all these years.

810
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,920
Oh, yeah!
The cake!

811
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:28,880
I'm thinking traditional vanilla
with strawberry drizzle.

812
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,160
Look, Viola, I really do
have all of this under control.

813
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,690
I made this for you.

814
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,660
It's your wedding planner book.
Peach.

815
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,330
Is that a picture
of me and Kevin?

816
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,920
And... present time
from your new mama!

817
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,930
Thanks.

818
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,840
Wow!

819
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,710
It's big! You can see
the thorns on the roses.

820
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,240
You'll wear it on your wedding day,
just like I did.

821
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,820
Of course I was
a virgin when I wed.

822
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,510
But we'll just pretend
with you.

823
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,370
Now, about the wedding...

824
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,980
the two of you are going to arrive
in a horse and carriage.

825
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,240
And the driver's top-hat
will match the horse's saddles,

826
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,860
and the ribbons
on the doves

827
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,820
that will be released
at the exact moment

828
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,940
of "I do," hmm?

829
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,530
And I've been in touch
with your bridesmaids.

830
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,130
How do you know
their names?

831
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,860
Well, Kevin told me.
And I think for the honeymoon

832
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,560
St. Bart's is the absolute
best place for you to go

833
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,700
- 'cause Kevin adores it.
- Hey, just hold on!

834
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,530
Just wait
a minute, okay?

835
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,440
No.

836
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,570
Thank you, but no.

837
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,340
Thank you,
but no to everything.

838
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,470
No to the horse
and buggy.

839
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,310
No to the top-hats,
and to the doves and geese

840
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,110
and any other farm animals
you're thinking of using that day.

841
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,570
And definitely no to you
planning our honeymoon.

842
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,840
- What?
- Oh no.

843
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,110
I can...

844
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,850
- Oh oh!
- What's wrong?

845
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,750
- "Oh no" what?
- My pills, my pills!

846
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:06,950
Okay.
Well, let me help you.

847
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,450
- Viola!

848
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,360
- Oh, no!
- Wait, Viola!

849
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:14,950
Viola!

850
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,650
Oh my God, Viola.
Oh my God!

851
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:19,520
- Give her some room.
- Help!

852
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,160
- Give her some air.
- My God, is she dead?

853
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,130
- No!
- Get her some help.

854
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,290
It couldn't be
that easy.

855
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,700
She's had
an anxiety attack,

856
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,800
which can feel like
a heart attack.

857
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,340
She's gonna be okay.

858
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,940
But she definitely needs
to take it easy. No stress.

859
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:42,900
She said that you were
yelling at her,

860
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,540
that you refused her gift
and said she couldn't plan our wedding.

861
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,140
Tell me that's
not true.

862
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,980
Well, technically...

863
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,150
yes.

864
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,820
But, hold on.
I didn't yell at her.

865
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,080
And she just kept pushing
and pushing and pushing.

866
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,850
And, okay, I admit it.
I snapped a little bit. But...

867
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,650
What was I supposed to do?
She wouldn't take no for an answer.

868
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,280
Come on, look, you know
what a hard time she's been having.

869
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,250
- So she's a little difficult.
- Difficult?

870
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,590
A two-year-old
is difficult.

871
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,720
- She's like... ah!
- Come on, she's all alone.

872
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:13,580
I'm all she's got...
we're all she's got.

873
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,790
Come on.

874
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,150
Excuse me.

875
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,620
I'm Dr. Chamberlain,
the psychiatrist in residence.

876
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,050
- Are you Mrs. Fields's son?
- Yes.

877
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,610
- May we speak in private?
- Actually, this is my fiance.

878
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,320
We can talk.
Is she okay?

879
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:28,390
Well, I just completed your mother's
interview and I'm concerned.

880
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,160
It's possible that she's on the verge
of a psychotic break.

881
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:35,990
I should probably see her
at least twice a week, minimum.

882
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,700
Also, I prescribed her
some anti-anxiety medication.

883
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,260
If she starts to feel
overwhelmed, they'll relax her.

884
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,770
Does she live alone?

885
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,030
Yeah.

886
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,060
Well, I feel
it would be best

887
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,870
if she were cared for
by relatives...

888
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,170
people that are closest
to her during this time.

889
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,580
Just until we're confident
that she's out of danger.

890
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,180
All right.
Well, thank you, Doctor.

891
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,380
Oh, God.

892
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,170
I've got that
medical conference.

893
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,540
What am I gonna do?

894
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,540
You know what?
Don't... don't worry about it.

895
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,370
I'll take care of her.

896
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,350
Thank you.

897
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,080
- Come on.
- What?

898
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,260
- No, come with me.
- No no, the doctor said no stress.

899
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,660
- Charlie, come on. Enough already.
- I'll stay here. Kevin!

900
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,960
Come on.

901
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,830
I am so sorry.

902
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,130
No, Mom, don't be.
It's okay, really.

903
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,290
Charlie?

904
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,490
I'm sorry too, Viola.

905
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,940
No, I was too pushy.

906
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,500
No.

907
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,980
You weren't.
Look, Viola...

908
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,810
I would love it if you would
help me with the wedding.

909
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,550
It's all right,
sweetheart, I...

910
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,670
I don't really think
I'm up to it.

911
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,710
My nerves are shot.

912
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,510
Mom...

913
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,980
Mom, Charlie and I think
you should live with us for a while,

914
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,830
until you feel better.

915
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,830
Are you sure?

916
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,360
I can't possibly.

917
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,330
- I couldn't.
- Mom, it's okay. Relax.

918
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,170
I couldn't possibly.

919
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,260
Not unless I know
Charlotte's forgiven me.

920
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,400
Will you?

921
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,630
Me?

922
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,790
Yeah, I forgive you.

923
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,950
You just put those
anywhere.

924
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,880
- Hi!
- Hi.

925
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,250
- Are you feeling better?
- I'm much better, thank you.

926
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,320
- Great.
- Sweetheart, I'm kind of thirsty.

927
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,520
- Would you... is the kitchen over there?
- Yeah, sure.

928
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,020
- Great. Goodbye.
- Okay.

929
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,580
- Hey, Charlie.
- Are you moving in, too?

930
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,450
No, I don't like
the neighborhood.

931
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,790
Look, do you have any
firearms in the house?

932
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,100
- No.
- You might want to get one.

933
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,200
When will you be back?

934
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,340
Soon as I can, honey.
I promise.

935
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,470
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

936
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,540
Yeah. I mean, hey,
it's only at night, right?

937
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,910
And, I mean, she's gonna
sleep most of the time

938
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,740
with those pills
the doctor gave her. Right?

939
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,380
Look, I know my mom can be
a little challenging.

940
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,610
So if you have any
problems just call me.

941
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,590
I'm on the first flight back,
I promise.

942
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,780
Okay.
Well, hurry home.

943
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,650
And who knows?
By the time I get back,

944
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,080
maybe you two
will be best friends.

945
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,990
Am I interrupting
something?

946
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,020
- No, Mom, come in.
- The caterer called.

947
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,880
He still thinks
I'm doing the wedding.

948
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,890
He sent over a sample plate
'cause I gave him the colors you wanted.

949
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,960
I said absolutely no peach.

950
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,430
And from now on, everything
goes through my new daughter.

951
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,190
- Thank you.
- Yeah?

952
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,700
Okay, I'll be
right down, thanks.

953
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,560
- Here. Look.
- It's beautiful, Viola.

954
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,870
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you like it.

955
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,760
- Thanks.
- My car's here. Gotta go.

956
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,130
- Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.
- Okay.

957
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,830
Bye, sweetie.
It's gonna be fun.

958
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,970
- We're gonna have such a good time.
- I love you.

959
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,180
- I'll be a good roommate. I promise.
- Okay.

960
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,910
It's so nice
to have a girlfriend.

961
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,540
Viola?

962
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,150
- Are you all right?
- I can't sleep.

963
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,650
I feel so alone.

964
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,510
I do.

965
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,650
You're not alone.
I'm here.

966
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,810
Did you take
your pills?

967
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,290
My pills?
Oh no, I forgot.

968
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:12,660
Could you get them
for me, sweetie?

969
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,590
They're on the sink.

970
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,760
Sure.

971
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,690
Here they are.

972
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,240
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

973
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:32,070
I don't have any water.
Could you get me some water please?

974
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,460
Okay.

975
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,110
I can't drink out
of the tap.

976
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:41,240
Would you get me some Evian...
with ice?

977
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,660
Yeah.

978
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:53,020
Here you go.

979
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,860
Thank you.

980
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,060
You have a good night,
okay?

981
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:01,930
Charlotte?

982
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,720
I hate to ask you this,

983
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,980
but it's my
first night here.

984
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,500
Could you stay with me?

985
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,300
Please?

986
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,910
Sleep with me.
Be a good girl.

987
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,470
No no no!

988
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,210
No no, don't!

989
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,670
God! Viola!

990
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,980
- Are you okay?
- No, let go of me, you!

991
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,540
No.

992
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,090
Okay. Okay.

993
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,720
Hi, how was your day?

994
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:14,350
It was... okay.

995
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,060
Wonderful!

996
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:17,420
You're cooking.

997
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,390
I wanted to make you
dinner all by myself.

998
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,220
- Sit.
- Okay.

999
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,260
It's steak
and kidney pie.

1000
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,420
Actually, the steak didn't defrost
in time so it's mostly kidney.

1001
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,350
Mmm!

1002
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,520
- Do you like it?
- Mm-hm!

1003
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,500
I made a decision today.

1004
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,340
I called my lawyer
and I asked him to redo my will.

1005
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,380
I want to include
my new daughter.

1006
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,780
Really, Viola,
that's not necessary.

1007
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,540
Don't be silly.
I want to.

1008
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,710
Of course they have all these
stupid questions that they want to ask.

1009
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,480
You know, like, "Are you
currently an illegal alien?"

1010
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,380
Oh no.

1011
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,390
That's interesting.
Okay.

1012
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,490
Are there any hereditary illnesses
in your family?

1013
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,360
You know, the kind that could be
passed on to grandchildren?

1014
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,120
- No.
- No.

1015
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,030
How many men have you been
sexually active with?

1016
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,120
What? Why would they
want to know that?

1017
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,830
That many?

1018
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,690
Would you be willing to sign
a prenuptial agreement?

1019
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,770
- Excuse me?
- I know.

1020
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,570
They're such nosy bastards.
It's none of their business.

1021
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,000
Let's just deal
with this later.

1022
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,610
No, why don't we deal
with it right now?

1023
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,400
I'll tell you what,
I'll clean up the kitchen

1024
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,640
and you continue
enjoying your dinner.

1025
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:41,170
No no no.

1026
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,530
You did all the cooking.
I'll clean up.

1027
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,270
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1028
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,580
I am kind of tired.
Thanks.

1029
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,380
Well, I'll just
go up to bed then.

1030
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,850
I had kind of a difficult
night last night.

1031
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,020
You had a difficult night?

1032
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,720
He's skidding
out of control.

1033
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,060
This bus is out of control.

1034
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,260
Is somebody there?

1035
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,690
Tina.

1036
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,060
Tina.

1037
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:16,890
Who the hell is that?

1038
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,420
What?
Oh my God.

1039
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:42,290
- I thought you were sleeping.
- Well, I couldn't sleep.

1040
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,160
What do you think
of my outfit?

1041
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,960
This is a ceremonial robe
given to me by Chairman Mao.

1042
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,490
These go with the robe.

1043
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,350
This was a birthday gift
from the Dalai Lama.

1044
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,440
He never forgot
my birthday.

1045
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,780
Of course now
he doesn't care anymore.

1046
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,650
- Do you mind if I sit with you?
- No.

1047
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:59,530
- Just for a little while.
- Okay.

1048
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,790
Why is she running?

1049
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,330
Well, someone's
chasing her.

1050
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,530
Why is he chasing her?

1051
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,600
I'm not sure.

1052
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:12,130
Well, who is he?

1053
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,190
I don't know.
We have to watch.

1054
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,390
- You have to stop talking.
- Mm.

1055
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,270
Don't you hate
what she's wearing?

1056
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,970
Running out there
with bare feet and, what is that,

1057
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,170
a pajama top?
It's so unrealistic.

1058
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,010
I once did a whole segment
on nighttime television.

1059
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,400
You would not believe

1060
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,710
how much the demographics
influence the networks.

1061
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,810
I mean it's just ridiculous.
All they care about is the bottom line.

1062
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,800
It's so nice just to sit
with family and do nothing?

1063
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,550
Don't even need to talk.
It's wonderful.

1064
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,650
I miss so much
being a working mom.

1065
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,450
I used to bring Kevin,
though, to the set.

1066
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,280
That's where he met
Gore Vidal and Jackie Chan.

1067
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,790
Is there anybody famous
in this movie?

1068
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,210
Because I don't know
any of them.

1069
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,820
And they all look
the same... all the girls

1070
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,080
have the same body,
all the boys have the same hair.

1071
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,610
...so many beautiful people
who live in Los Angeles?

1072
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,430
I think all the beautiful genes
ended up in California.

1073
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,830
Why is he kissing her?
It's beyond me.

1074
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:21,280
I'm sorry. I thought
it was air freshener.

1075
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,260
- Charlie?
- Dr. Batel's office.

1076
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:36,030
Miss Reynolds?

1077
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,890
Hi.

1078
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:39,590
Yeah.

1079
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,820
Nope. Okay.

1080
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:44,190
Bye.

1081
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,570
Oh God. I-I'm sorry.

1082
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,800
You know what?
That's probably my fault.

1083
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,410
I mean,
I never thought she'd...

1084
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,330
I mean, she's a little
eccentric, you know?

1085
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,940
- I'm sorry.
- Well, It doesn't matter.

1086
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,200
I don't want to talk about your mom
tonight. I want to talk about us.

1087
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,410
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

1088
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:09,070
Especially now
when I'm in the tub...

1089
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,100
naked and wet...

1090
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,990
and naked.

1091
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,680
Really?

1092
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,720
Well, do you know what I would do
to you if I was there?

1093
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,280
- What?
- Well, for starters...

1094
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,950
Charlie!

1095
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,780
- I'm not looking. I'm not looking.
- Hello?

1096
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,860
- I just wanted to return your shampoo.
- Your mom just walked in.

1097
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,550
You really should use a shampoo
that doesn't dry your hair so much.

1098
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,950
We don't want a bride
with straw under her veil.

1099
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,830
- Is that Kevin?
- Yeah, it is.

1100
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,190
- Honey, your mom wants to talk to you.
- Sweetie, hi.

1101
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:38,570
- Hi, Mom.
- Honey, I can't thank you both enough.

1102
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,400
- Of course.
- I'm having the most wonderful time.

1103
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,740
- How's Charlie?
- She's been a doll.

1104
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,800
We've been girlfriends
all week.

1105
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,640
- Great.
- I'm gonna be sad to go home.

1106
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:53,500
You do? Well, you never know
what the future's gonna bring right?

1107
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,340
I mean, I do love
this neighborhood.

1108
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,810
In fact, you know,
two doors down,

1109
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,740
there's this house
for sale.

1110
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,610
It's got two
big bay windows

1111
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,310
and a great rose garden.

1112
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,180
You know how
I love rose gardens.

1113
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,580
And basically,
it's got my name all over it.

1114
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,450
I'm having my...
my...

1115
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,340
real estate guy
look into it.

1116
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,910
She's buying a house here?

1117
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,650
Two doors away.

1118
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:16,580
"Lovely property.
Beautiful bay windows. "

1119
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,450
It's bullshit!

1120
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,550
She doesn't even like
this neighborhood.

1121
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,720
Oh God, I'm so exhausted.

1122
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,620
She's driving me insane!

1123
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,790
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can!

1124
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,590
Stop being
such a big baby.

1125
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,890
Kevin is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1126
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:36,070
Charlie, do not
give up on this one.

1127
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,930
It seems Mommy Dearest
has been keeping

1128
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:40,670
a very close eye on you,
sweetie.

1129
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,430
What are you talking about?
What are you doing in her clothes?

1130
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:46,800
I was just upstairs in her room
minding my own business.

1131
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,400
And I found all of this
in her closet.

1132
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,830
She's been
investigating you.

1133
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,400
Whoa.

1134
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,570
Why does she have
your high school transcripts?

1135
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,220
I know.

1136
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,010
There's a picture of me
at the beach?!

1137
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,550
- Yes, it is.
- I can't believe that.

1138
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,580
There's another picture
of you in here.

1139
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,780
And it's... look.

1140
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,240
Look at that.
It's like a closeup.

1141
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,670
But you have to be close
to take that, right?

1142
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,480
Look at all this Gucci!

1143
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,320
It's just
Gucci Gucci Gucci!

1144
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,320
She has skin caviar.
This stuff sells for $400 a jar.

1145
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:19,190
- I've heard of that. I want a try.
- Here.

1146
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:21,060
- Mm.
- Doesn't that smell good?

1147
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,920
Ooh, hello.

1148
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,860
What are these?

1149
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:27,120
Those are
just her anti-anxiety pills.

1150
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:29,380
- These are good.
- Really?

1151
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,700
They'd knock out a horse.
I have these at home.

1152
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,690
- You do?
- Wait

1153
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:37,000
I don't know what these are.
But they're definitely not what I take.

1154
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:38,700
They smell like
oranges or something.

1155
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,930
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1156
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,370
Let me see.

1157
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,710
Hi, Andy.
It's Charlie.

1158
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,570
Now, I'm not working
for Dr. Batel's office this week.

1159
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,670
But I had a question.
Yeah, about some pills.

1160
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:55,210
Can I stop by?

1161
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,610
Charlie, I'm having
a bit of a bad day,

1162
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,150
so Ruby's gonna take me
to see Dr. Chamberlain.

1163
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,080
Okay!
You take care!

1164
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,990
Let's see
what you're up to.

1165
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,120
- There you go.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

1166
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,490
- And thank you.
- Wear that, sister.

1167
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,360
Okay, now Cartier
is one right down.

1168
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,550
- Where's Niketown?
- What?

1169
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,430
- Niketown.
- Niketown?

1170
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,590
Bad day, my ass.

1171
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,080
Wait a minute.

1172
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,780
Dr. Chamberlain?

1173
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,580
All right.

1174
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,610
Hello?

1175
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,480
Hey, Andy.

1176
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:54,820
What are they?

1177
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,610
Chewable vitamin Cs?

1178
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:00,090
Okay, thanks.

1179
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,860
I know. I can't believe
the wedding's only a week away.

1180
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:14,310
No, we do the final
walk-through on Monday.

1181
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,040
Wait a minute.
I think I hear her car.

1182
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,880
Drop my stuff
at my house, okay?

1183
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:24,170
All right.
Look crazy.

1184
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,930
Charlie!

1185
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,690
Charlie!

1186
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,490
I had to bring him
home with me today.

1187
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:51,670
He's harmless.

1188
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,600
Sit. No!

1189
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,140
No. No.

1190
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,540
No, Zorro! Sit!

1191
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,280
Is that expensive?

1192
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,350
It was.

1193
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,630
Sorry!

1194
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,930
Charlie!

1195
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:35,730
Bonus.

1196
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:39,140
Good boy.
Come on.

1197
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:41,010
Come on.

1198
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:46,910
Mmm.

1199
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,240
Hello, old friend.

1200
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,480
Viola!

1201
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,710
You can't mix alcohol
with your pills!

1202
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:57,080
I'm a little upset

1203
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,950
as you can imagine.

1204
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,150
Well, I know that

1205
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,360
and I'm sorry,
but your doctor said

1206
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,180
if you're feeling upset

1207
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,420
that you should take
your pills, not alcohol.

1208
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:09,760
So you relax.
I'll get them.

1209
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,970
Shit.

1210
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:32,910
Here we go.

1211
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,780
This will make
you feel better.

1212
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,780
Drink up.

1213
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,950
Now I hope you like
what I made.

1214
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:44,500
It's one of my mother's
specialties.

1215
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:51,310
- What's that?
- Tripe.

1216
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,620
It's a delicacy.

1217
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,280
Try it.

1218
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,760
It's like nothing
you've ever tasted.

1219
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:04,560
Trust me.

1220
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:11,360
So Kevin called.

1221
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:13,160
He's coming home tomorrow.
I can't wait.

1222
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:14,700
I'm so excited.
I miss him so much.

1223
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,270
I was thinking maybe the three of us
could go to lunch tomorrow.

1224
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,130
What do you think?

1225
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:20,700
Yeah, I think it's
a great idea too.

1226
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,730
I'll make reservations.

1227
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:25,110
It'll be so much fun.

1228
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,880
Don't you just love
being girlfriends?

1229
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,420
Night-night,
sleep tight.

1230
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,860
And good morning
to you too.

1231
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:58,140
- Ruby, is that you?
- In here!

1232
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,040
Oh my God.
Is she all right?

1233
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,900
I thought she went
to bed.

1234
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,910
I don't know.
I haven't seen her like this

1235
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,770
since "The View"
won an Emmy.

1236
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,840
I wish I could stay
and help

1237
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,380
but I've got to go
pick up Kevin at the airport.

1238
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,000
What?

1239
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,120
I underestimated you.

1240
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,380
You don't need a gun.

1241
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,320
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1242
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:29,890
Mm-hm.

1243
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,100
Last call!

1244
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:40,560
We'll see you
tomorrow night.

1245
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,700
There's a reservation
under Fields, Kevin.

1246
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:45,190
Yes, right this way.

1247
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,060
I'm so glad my mom and you
had a great week.

1248
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,240
We did. I learned
a lot about her.

1249
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:52,140
So who's
the mystery guest?

1250
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,680
Surprise!

1251
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:58,610
I thought your office
said we were having lunch alone.

1252
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:01,110
Well, I hope you guys
forgive me. I just...

1253
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,410
I wanted to talk
to you and Kevin together.

1254
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,850
So how are you, Mom?

1255
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,710
Fine.

1256
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,470
Though I did have
a rather difficult night.

1257
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:16,460
It was probably
that martini you had.

1258
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,520
Mom, you're not supposed
to be drink alcohol

1259
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,060
with those pills
you're taking.

1260
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,650
You know, the truth is

1261
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,660
I owe you an apology.

1262
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:27,760
You know, I was so insensitive
to your feelings

1263
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,390
about wanting to help
with the wedding.

1264
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,560
It's ancient history.

1265
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:34,190
A young bride doesn't want to hear
the opinions of an old widow.

1266
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,870
No no,
that is not true.

1267
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,340
I mean, you're going
to be my mom soon.

1268
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,040
And a grandma shortly
after, hopefully.

1269
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,840
And I want you to know
that I will do anything it takes

1270
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,710
to make this
relationship work.

1271
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,840
That said...

1272
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,780
will you be my maid...

1273
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,910
I mean, my matron
of honor?

1274
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,850
Charlie, that's...
that's amazing.

1275
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:03,820
- Mom, what do you say?
- But...

1276
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:05,980
Morgan is gonna be
your maid of honor.

1277
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,290
No, she has graciously
relinquished her title to you.

1278
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:12,190
And I had this
specially made up.

1279
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,270
A dress in your
favorite color... peach.

1280
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,420
- Come on, open it.
- Well, that's...

1281
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,590
Char... ah.

1282
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,960
I- I don't think I can.

1283
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:28,900
Mom, I think
it's a great idea.

1284
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,440
I just don't think
I'm up to it.

1285
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:32,470
I really don't. I've got
to talk to my doctor.

1286
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:33,970
I called him.
Yeah!

1287
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,040
And he said he thought
it was a great idea.

1288
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:39,770
- You called my psychiatrist?
- Mm-hmm.

1289
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,700
In fact, we had lunch
at The Ivy.

1290
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,610
Well, anyway...

1291
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,870
he said, considering
this turning point in your life,

1292
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,540
you know, losing
so much so suddenly,

1293
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,020
that being involved
in the future

1294
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:53,550
would be the best therapy
in the world for you right now.

1295
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:56,520
Careful. You know
those are strong.

1296
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:00,580
You know, we...
are your future.

1297
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,250
And we want you
to be part of it.

1298
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:07,250
I can have a list of duties
for you tomorrow.

1299
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,230
No.

1300
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,850
M- mom... no, Mom.

1301
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,930
Mom, don't cry.

1302
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:16,510
Here.

1303
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:20,960
Charlie.

1304
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,200
I didn't think
I would be this emotional.

1305
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,000
Mom, here.
Can I?

1306
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,240
Thank you, baby.
I love you.

1307
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:32,270
- I love you too.
- I love you too!

1308
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,710
I love you too, Mom.

1309
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,840
Kevin, you know what? Why don't you
give your mom and I a moment alone?

1310
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:39,640
Yes, of course.

1311
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,320
Just so you know,
the crying bits are getting old.

1312
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:50,050
Just so you know,
Kevin likes his girls thin.

1313
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:52,190
Well,
I can always get liposuction.

1314
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,050
I've been meaning to ask.
Is it painful?

1315
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,360
That maid of honor bit.

1316
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,050
Priceless!

1317
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:01,460
You know what they say? Keep your
friends close, keep your enemies closer.

1318
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,100
- Now you listen to me.

1319
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,960
This is my game now.

1320
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:09,000
You are going to tell Kevin that you
are not moving into our neighborhood,

1321
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,530
and that you've decided
that you're feeling like it's time

1322
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:13,500
that you go on
with your own life!

1323
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,930
You're moving out
of our house immediately.

1324
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:18,550
This is over!

1325
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,470
This isn't over,
not even close, girlie!

1326
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:27,120
Well, bring it on,
Grandma.

1327
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,080
That little bitch!

1328
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,620
Let's go someplace near
the ocean and drink lunch.

1329
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,590
What?

1330
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,280
You know exactly what.

1331
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,520
Move!

1332
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:42,420
Move! Move!

1333
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,890
What's wrong with you?

1334
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:49,350
I am sick.
I am sick sick sick of your shit.

1335
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,690
And I when I'm not sick,
I'm tired.

1336
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,870
I am sick and tired.

1337
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,890
What are you saying?

1338
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,270
Damn you
and your luggage!

1339
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,600
Ruby, you're not going
to leave me too, are you?

1340
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,270
No, I'm not leaving you!

1341
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,930
You old slut!

1342
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,170
Ruby!

1343
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:13,570
- Ruby, please...
- Hey, you almost forgot your dress!

1344
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,730
You'll have nothing
to wear to the wedding.

1345
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,610
See you, Ruby!

1346
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,840
Maybe we can get you
a matching bonnet.

1347
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,580
See you
at the rehearsal dinner!

1348
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:30,380
Motherf...!

1349
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:40,730
So, how's the bride-to-be
holding up?

1350
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:44,030
Under the circumstances
I'd say mediocre. But she's tough.

1351
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,100
Not as tough
as the old bird.

1352
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:48,630
- What does that mean?
- For your own safety,

1353
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,170
make sure you know where
the emergency exits are at all times.

1354
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,380
Hey, are you
and my mom okay?

1355
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:00,370
Great. Yeah, I just have a little
of the pre-wedding nerves,

1356
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:01,910
but everything's
under control.

1357
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,070
Of course.

1358
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,650
Hello, everyone!

1359
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,190
Welcome
to the rehearsal dinner.

1360
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,690
- My God, she looks amazing.
- I know.

1361
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,680
Father Tyson.

1362
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:22,060
Hello, Blaire.

1363
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,160
Kit, how are you?

1364
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:25,290
Hello, hello.

1365
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,000
- You are Morgan.
- Yes.

1366
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,030
I have heard so much about your delicious
catering service.

1367
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:35,900
I have a lot of friends.
You're going to be a busy girl.

1368
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:38,860
- And you're Remy.
- Yeah.

1369
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,040
I recognize you from all the wonderful
things Charlie's told me about you.

1370
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:44,370
Wow. Well, Ms. Fields,
I have to say...

1371
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:48,110
- Call me Viola. Please, I insist.
- Viola.

1372
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:51,150
- All right, I'm gonna go get a drink.
- Okay.

1373
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,010
I'm such a huge fan.

1374
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:56,980
- You...
- I...

1375
01:13:57,150 --> 01:13:59,780
Well, mi casa, su casa.
Make yourself at home.

1376
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:03,150
- Thank you. Bye, Viola.
- Cheers.

1377
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,080
- Goodbye.
- I like her a lot. Hi.

1378
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,950
- Hey!
- Hi!

1379
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,420
- You guys have a nice little chit-chat? - Oh
my God. She came over

1380
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:11,490
and started talking to us.
What did you want us to do?

1381
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:13,030
- Ignore her?
- Yes!

1382
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,990
So then getting her autograph
would be completely out of the question?

1383
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:23,230
- Was that yes? 'Cause... okay.
- No.

1384
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,900
So there I was sitting next
to the Sultan of Brunei

1385
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,940
with Maureen Dowd,
Carrie Fisher and Snoop Dogg.

1386
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:30,800
You know the story, Kevin.

1387
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,740
I said to Snoop, "Snoop,
I think your lyrics

1388
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:35,560
are sometimes a little
sexist and unfair to women. "

1389
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:38,660
And the Sultan of Brunei said,
"Really? I have 114 wives

1390
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,940
and they're all
huge fans of the Dogg!"

1391
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,800
Honey, would you see
who's at the door?

1392
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:50,970
Sure.

1393
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:54,370
These are delicious, Viola.

1394
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:56,250
Kit,
I'm glad you like it.

1395
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,040
Mm, yeah.

1396
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,550
Look who's here.
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1397
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,780
Oh my God!
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1398
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,180
- Hi! Everybody, it's Dr. Chamberlain!
- Hi. Good evening.

1399
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,690
- Thanks so much for inviting me.
- Shit!

1400
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:11,350
That's Dr. Chamberlain.
He's Viola's doctor.

1401
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:13,120
We're going to need
another place setting.

1402
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:14,720
Please,
let me get that.

1403
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,920
- There's a chair in the living room.
- Sure.

1404
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:19,620
Scootch down, you guys.
Come on, make room.

1405
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,390
You guys move down.

1406
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,260
Cheers. Thank you.

1407
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:24,320
Who's he?

1408
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,430
It's Viola's therapist.
Move down, you guys!

1409
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,290
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

1410
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:33,500
- Here's you chair, Doctor.
- Here. Have mine, too.

1411
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:35,230
Hello.

1412
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:36,270
Hi.

1413
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

1414
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:41,940
I'll get it.

1415
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:44,180
So you just got here?

1416
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,540
- Are you expecting anyone else?

1417
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,010
- Hello, everybody!
- Fiona!

1418
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,970
I'm so glad to see you.

1419
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,610
I just couldn't resist
bringing the happy couple

1420
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,470
a little gift.

1421
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,610
That's great. I will
get you a place setting.

1422
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,910
She's bringing a gift?
I think she is the gift.

1423
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,850
What the hell
is she doing here?

1424
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,990
- How about some more wine, everyone?
- Yeah!

1425
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,650
How much longer do we have to stay?
I have midterms tomorrow.

1426
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,090
Shh.

1427
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,750
- I get it.
- No, baby, not now, okay?

1428
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,690
It's not the time.

1429
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,820
So, Dr. Chamberlain,

1430
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,460
tell us about med school.
Where did you do your residency?

1431
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,720
Now that's...
that's a long story.

1432
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,190
I don't think your guests
want to hear that.

1433
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,330
No, we really
want to know.

1434
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,400
I think we need
some more gravy.

1435
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:32,200
What is going on?

1436
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,030
What are you doing?

1437
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:36,000
I'm behaving.

1438
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:37,200
Viola, no!

1439
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,600
You can't!
Charlie's allergic to nuts!

1440
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,440
Give it to me!

1441
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,950
Viola, you're crazy.

1442
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:55,720
Get up.

1443
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:58,120
Put the gravy down
or I'm telling Kevin.

1444
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,590
Yeah!

1445
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,250
What's the big deal?
So her face swells up...

1446
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:06,060
swells up a little.
So what?

1447
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:09,050
Swells up a little? Her face'll
blow up like a Macy's Day balloon.

1448
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,260
Well, good. It'll match
the other body parts!

1449
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:14,520
Viola, think about
what you're doing.

1450
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:16,700
Come on, the girl's
getting married tomorrow!

1451
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,270
Ruby, when did you
lose your edge?

1452
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,800
Right after
you lost your mind.

1453
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:21,940
Come on.

1454
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,430
All right. Okay.
No nuts.

1455
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:24,840
Come on.

1456
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,100
Viola, I think you
dislocated my vagina.

1457
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,970
- Where's the...
- Where's the what?

1458
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,160
Gravy? More gravy?

1459
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:32,040
Anyone for more gravy?

1460
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:34,980
I am not
doing time for you!

1461
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,970
- Where's the back door?
- Stay cool, Ruby!

1462
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:38,410
Stay cool! This is no time
to lose your nerve.

1463
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,300
If I get arrested
I'm gonna sing like a canary.

1464
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,280
Maybe she won't
take any gravy.

1465
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,370
- That's a lot of gravy.
- Mmm!

1466
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:46,750
This gravy's delicious!

1467
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,470
You... you gotta go
stop her!

1468
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,450
- Go on, stop her. Go stop her.
- You go, you go, you go.

1469
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:54,150
Why me?
You're the culprit? You go!

1470
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,680
- You're my assistant.
- What am I supposed to do?

1471
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:58,320
Go out there and stick my finger
down her throat?

1472
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:00,080
Yeah.

1473
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,350
Baby, are you okay?

1474
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,620
Kevin, my tongue
feels weird.

1475
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,120
I think
something's wrong!

1476
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,750
Charlie, are you okay?

1477
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,820
- What are we gonna do now?
- Hide the damn nuts!

1478
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,370
- Are you all right?
- Get her some water.

1479
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,030
Flat or sparkling?

1480
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:24,570
The caterer says he doesn't know how
this could have happened.

1481
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:27,570
Well, I feel like I ate
a loaf of nuts.

1482
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,310
I mean, even my tongue
is swollen.

1483
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,310
You're marrying
a big, fat, puffy tomato mouth.

1484
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:40,310
It's not that bad, really. Besides,
the swelling's already going down.

1485
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,410
- Yeah?
- Hey, Kev.

1486
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:43,910
- Yeah.
- Just coming to check up

1487
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,790
on the bride-to-be.
For the love of God...

1488
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,920
- Out!
- You see?

1489
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,020
I told you it looks terrible.

1490
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:51,780
- I told you.
- Baby, I promise you.

1491
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,190
In 24 hours the swelling
will be completely gone.

1492
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,160
Give me that!

1493
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,310
Door was open.

1494
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,250
Thank God.

1495
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,950
- The Bride of Frankenstein is gone.
- I know.

1496
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,990
I was up half
the night worrying.

1497
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,150
- You look great.
- I just don't know

1498
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,120
- how those nuts got in there.
- Yeah.

1499
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:36,650
Hmm.
Wait.

1500
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,390
Hey, do you think
she would...

1501
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,520
No!

1502
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,930
Come on.

1503
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,700
I mean, she's crazy,

1504
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:47,890
but she's not like,
psycho-killer crazy.

1505
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:49,060
Hmm.

1506
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,730
No!

1507
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:57,200
I was wondering.
Could I bring a date

1508
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:59,070
to your wedding?

1509
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,470
Of course. My God.
How exciting.

1510
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,770
Great. Thanks.
So then, I'll see you later.

1511
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:05,270
But... w-wait!

1512
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,310
- Who is he? Tell me!
- It's...

1513
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,410
okay, don't be mad.
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1514
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,280
Actually "Paul. "

1515
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:15,010
- Is that his real name?
- That's very funny.

1516
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,880
I gotta go get a mani, pedi
and my eyebrows waxed.

1517
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:19,510
But I'll see you in
a couple hours, okay?

1518
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:20,780
- Let me go down with you.
- Okay.

1519
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,480
Oh God.

1520
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,350
She added
even more ruffles!

1521
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,790
Where's your prom date,
seorita?

1522
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:36,560
Wait a minute. This is too
damn good. Where's my camera?

1523
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:37,960
This is just too good.

1524
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,760
Will you just get me
out of this right now?

1525
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:42,770
Come here.

1526
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,020
- Cheers.
- Hey.

1527
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,780
Thanks for coming.

1528
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,110
Okay, guys, let's go see
how Charlie's doing.

1529
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:09,390
Ah, yes, please.

1530
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,790
Oh my God. Those are
so much better than mine.

1531
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,530
Don't... touch me!

1532
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:25,140
I got out of that car
the same way I got in it...

1533
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:28,970
without you.
Now where is she?

1534
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:37,240
You here with the bride
or the groom?

1535
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:39,380
I'm here with my mother.

1536
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:46,880
She looked a lot older. L...

1537
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:52,120
Well, look
what we have here.

1538
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,290
Oh my God.

1539
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:57,200
You look beautiful.
Oh my God.

1540
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:59,120
- Oh my God.
- This is it!

1541
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,930
Yeah!

1542
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,220
- Oh God, did you talk to the priest?
- I talked to him.

1543
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,260
He's just going
to skip right over that whole

1544
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:07,260
- "if anyone should object" part.
- Okay.

1545
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,700
You're a vision in white,
sweetie, really.

1546
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:14,200
Knock knock.
Look at you!

1547
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:17,880
And so is your
mother-in-law.

1548
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:20,140
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

1549
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:22,970
All right.
Everybody out.

1550
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,310
Out.
Give the bride a moment.

1551
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,980
- No way.
- What?

1552
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,950
What is that?

1553
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,550
- What?
- Where's your bridesmaid's dress?

1554
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:42,860
I gave it
to Ruby's daughter.

1555
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:44,680
She works at Hooters.
She was thrilled.

1556
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,920
I don't have a daughter?

1557
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,840
Rude.

1558
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,430
Take off that
white dress right now

1559
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:56,700
or I'll take it off
for you.

1560
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,920
Don't you tell me
what to do!

1561
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,730
You did not
just poke me!

1562
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,420
Don't you touch me,
you two-bit tramp!

1563
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:08,230
Oh my God!
Viola, I'm so sorry.

1564
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,760
I didn't mean to...

1565
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,900
You don't go and slap somebody
then apologize.

1566
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,640
Get some backbone!

1567
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:22,770
God! This is crazy!

1568
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:24,380
Why don't you just
face it?

1569
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:26,710
I'm marrying Kevin today and there's
nothing you can do about it.

1570
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:29,710
You face it! You'll never be
good enough for him!

1571
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,240
Didn't stop you
from marrying my son.

1572
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:35,710
- Oh God, no.
- Well, look at you.

1573
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,580
All in white.

1574
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,050
You are so predictable.

1575
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:42,760
Gertrude.
I didn't know you were coming.

1576
01:23:42,930 --> 01:23:43,880
You didn't?

1577
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,790
Wonder why.
I know.

1578
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,520
You didn't send me
an invitation!

1579
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:50,860
I thought you
were dead.

1580
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,750
But evil doesn't die
so easily.

1581
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:55,590
I heard you got sacked
and thrown into a loony bin.

1582
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,800
- My congratulations.

1583
01:23:57,970 --> 01:23:59,530
Oh my God.

1584
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:01,400
Oh my God!

1585
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:03,500
These hors d'oeuvres
taste like old socks.

1586
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,330
Now, I want to get

1587
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,360
an up-close look
at the bride.

1588
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,900
Holy Toledo!

1589
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:13,900
You are a stunner!

1590
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,970
My grandson
is a lucky fellah.

1591
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:17,180
Look, what he did.

1592
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:21,940
He went out and found
himself an exotic Latina!

1593
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,980
Would that my son
had been that lucky.

1594
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:26,580
Here we go again.

1595
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,550
What? You were
a television weatherwoman

1596
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,740
in Dubuque, Montana.

1597
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,050
You drove around
in a broken-down minivan

1598
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:36,520
and you drank red wine
from a box!

1599
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,290
Classy.

1600
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,160
You killed him,
you know?

1601
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:44,020
- What?!
- You killed him.

1602
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:45,890
All the doctors agreed,

1603
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:49,320
my son died
of terminal disappointment!

1604
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,360
If anybody killed him,
you did.

1605
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:53,020
You smothered him
to death!

1606
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,970
Nobody was ever
good enough for him!

1607
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,890
My God, you look old!

1608
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,900
Fine.

1609
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:04,710
This woman is going
to drive me insane.

1610
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,280
Now, I'd rather not
take all the credit.

1611
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,480
You'll get over it.

1612
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,350
- Okay, I love you.
- You're kidding.

1613
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,100
This is never gonna end, is it?

1614
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:37,360
I mean, that's going
to be me and you in 30 years.

1615
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:40,700
We'll be doing
the exact same thing.

1616
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
You know what?

1617
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,340
I wanted to marry Kevin
because we make each other happy.

1618
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:53,240
But you're never gonna
let that happen.

1619
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:55,410
Are you?

1620
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:00,560
Oh my God.
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1621
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,520
You win, Viola.

1622
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,490
What do you mean?

1623
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,180
The wedding's off.

1624
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,690
Bye, Ruby.

1625
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:21,220
I- I cannot believe
she compared me to Gertrude.

1626
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,110
I know.
Now that's just wrong.

1627
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,640
- Thank you.
- You are far worse.

1628
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:29,830
I don't recall Gertrude
ever trying to poison you.

1629
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:32,210
And I'm pretty sure
she wore black to your wedding.

1630
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:34,400
Black. Yeah, she said
she was in mourning.

1631
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:36,170
Mm-hmm.

1632
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,700
I just want my son
to be happy.

1633
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,910
Whatever made you
think he wasn't?

1634
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:52,310
Hey, what are you
doing here?

1635
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:54,960
Don't you know it's
bad luck to see the...

1636
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:57,120
Charlie, what's wrong?

1637
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:01,060
What is it?

1638
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,560
Are you nervous?

1639
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:04,530
Hey.

1640
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,630
- Kevin, I need...
- Charlie,

1641
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,560
I need to talk to you.

1642
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:13,460
- Viola, stop it!
- It's the flower girls.

1643
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:16,390
- They're drunk again.
- What?

1644
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:17,980
Yeah, in the toilet.

1645
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,540
Not now, Viola, okay?

1646
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,130
It's really important.

1647
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:23,470
Just give us a minute.
She'll be right there.

1648
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,040
Please?

1649
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,210
Charlie, what is it?

1650
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:35,480
I'll be right back.

1651
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:42,680
What do you want, Viola?

1652
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,620
I don't want you
to walk out on this wedding.

1653
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,100
You don't?

1654
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:50,290
No, I don't.

1655
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,820
What, am I supposed to believe
that you've had some epiphany?

1656
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,300
That all of the sudden,
everything is going to be different?

1657
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,190
It's never been
about you, Charlie.

1658
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:59,000
It's me.

1659
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:00,820
I've been so afraid
of losing him.

1660
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,060
He's the only family
I've got.

1661
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:07,440
This is my chance
for a family, too.

1662
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,340
- And I'm scared.

1663
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:11,610
Don't blow your chance
for happiness.

1664
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,400
You've never needed
my approval.

1665
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,850
He's loved you
from the very beginning.

1666
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:19,700
And I promise I will
get out of the way

1667
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,080
and let the two of you
be happy.

1668
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,140
That's not what I want.

1669
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:26,510
I mean, there just has
to be some boundaries, Viola.

1670
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,010
I can do boundaries!

1671
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,550
I don't love boundaries
but I can do them.

1672
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:35,820
How about the number of times
you call Kevin a day?

1673
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:37,850
Can we limit that
to, like, one?

1674
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,860
I need at least
four minimum.

1675
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:43,020
- He's 35 years old.
- Three?

1676
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,960
- Two.
- Deal.

1677
01:28:45,130 --> 01:28:47,890
Two long-ass calls!

1678
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:49,890
When Kevin and I
have kids,

1679
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:52,030
he and I will decide
how they're raised.

1680
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,060
All right. But you know I have
raised one wonderful boy.

1681
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,670
- And my advice could be very...
- Will be solicited when needed.

1682
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,500
All right, as long as one kid
is named after me.

1683
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,300
- Middle name.
- Deal.

1684
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:04,630
What else?

1685
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:07,040
Holidays
and special occasions.

1686
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:09,300
Are you gonna keep
me away?

1687
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,470
You must be present
for every Christmas,

1688
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,810
Thanksgiving,
birthday,

1689
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:19,780
school play,
clarinet recital

1690
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:23,320
and soccer game
in our kids' lives.

1691
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,680
I want you to love them
and spoil them

1692
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:29,190
and teach them things
that Kevin and I can't.

1693
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:32,230
Like how to throw
a right hook for example.

1694
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,390
I want you there, Viola.

1695
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,620
I do, up front and center.

1696
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:45,100
From this point
I will not negotiate.

1697
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:48,860
Damn. That girl can give
a nice little speech.

1698
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,000
Deal?

1699
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:57,480
can they call me "Aunt Viola"
instead of "Grandma"?

1700
01:29:57,650 --> 01:30:00,310
Fine.

1701
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:12,190
Come on, unzip me.

1702
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,020
Viola, you don't
have to wear that dress, really.

1703
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,990
Yes, I do. Really.

1704
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,900
Go, Kevin and Charlie!

1705
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:31,930
Yeah!

1706
01:30:47,660 --> 01:30:50,720
Mom!

1707
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:52,760
Do you really think I would leave without
saying goodbye?

1708
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:56,930
I love you, Mom.

1709
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,500
- Thanks for everything.
- Go.

1710
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,160
Bye, you guys!

1711
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,830
Okay, everybody gather around
the back of the car!

1712
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:09,470
Charlie!

1713
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:11,930
Charlie, right here!
Right here, Charlie!

1714
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,460
Sheesh.

1715
01:31:32,630 --> 01:31:35,970
- Hawaii! I cannot wait!
- I know. I can't either.

1716
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:39,060
Have a great
time in Hawaii!

1717
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,330
- Good luck!
- Have fun in Hawaii!

1718
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,430
Just you and me
now, Ruby!

1719
01:31:47,610 --> 01:31:51,500
Jesus. Who did I kill
in a past life?

1720
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,700
And take off
that damn dress.

1721
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,170
You look like
a giant peach cobbler.

1722
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:57,000
You're making me hungry.

1723
01:31:57,180 --> 01:32:00,310
Come on, weathergirl,
I'll buy you a box of wine.
