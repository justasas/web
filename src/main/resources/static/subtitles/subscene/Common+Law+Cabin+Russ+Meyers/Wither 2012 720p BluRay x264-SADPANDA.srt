1
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,380
Lisa!

2
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,930
Lisa!

3
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,570
Lisa!

4
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,220
Lisa!

5
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,490
What in the hell are you doing?

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Stop it!

7
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,100
Honey, are you awake?

8
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,690
Can't you have breakfast with me
before I go to work?

9
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,110
Can't you stay in bed a little longer?

10
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,530
I don't have time.
What would we do in that case?

11
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,370
I don't know. Sleep.

12
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,550
What are you gonna do today?

13
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Nothing.

14
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,310
- I might visit Mackan in his office.
- Okay.

15
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,770
Can you pick up a bottle of wine for
your parents tonight?

16
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,810
That's not necessary.
Dad has plenty.

17
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,690
Would you please do it, I don't want
to come empty handed again.

18
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,630
I feel embarrassed about it. Please?

19
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,570
- I'll fix it.
- Thanks.

20
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,580
I really need to go now.

21
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,420
Go, then.

22
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,460
Damn you're hot.

23
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,270
Now I really have to go.
I'm opening today.

24
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,020
Can't you check with the girls,
so they are free.

25
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,360
- What do you mean?
- This weekend.

26
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,360
Oh, of course.

27
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,320
Say hi to Mackan for me.

28
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,450
Don't forget the wine.

29
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,700
I checked up on the house
we talked about,

30
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,790
it seems like it's been abandoned
since forever.

31
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,750
- So I think you can walk straight in.
- Sounds great!

32
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,840
That's perfect. Now we have a place
to stay for the weekend.

33
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,590
But are you sure it's abandoned?

34
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,510
Yes, of course.
If you run into any problems you can

35
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,220
just forward them to me.

36
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,190
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- Of course we'll be careful, Eva.

37
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,480
If you get bored, Dad and I
might come over.

38
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,900
Anyone for a whisky, Albin?

39
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,240
No, I hate whisky.
You know that.

40
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,570
I can take a whisky.
A small one.

41
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,030
Alright, nice.

42
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,870
Mom, could I have another beer?

43
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,010
Have you made any other
plans for the summer?

44
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,760
We talked about going somewhere in
August, but that depends

45
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,430
on if I can get time off.

46
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,640
- I see.
- Thanks.

47
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,480
If you're not doing anything else, you
could always come out to the cabin.

48
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,230
Well, you can barbeque,
go fishing or help out dad.

49
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,610
It sounds nice, mom, we'll consider it.

50
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,290
Dad, what do we do about
the electricity?

51
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,280
- Elin? (A girl's name)
- Electricity. In the house.

52
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,530
Aha, I thought you said Elin.

53
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,960
That's not gonna be a problem. I can
power it up temporarily from work.

54
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,900
I work for all the power distribution
so that's not a problem.

55
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,526
How long has the house been abandoned,
do you know that?

56
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,420
- I don't know, five years, maybe.
- Is there still furniture?

57
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,970
Yes, absolutely.

58
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,890
<i>I'll</i> make a map for you.

59
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,270
There are some small, hard to find
roads, but it'll be alright.

60
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,930
Great.

61
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,150
Now let's make a toast.
To Elin. No, what am I saying?

62
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,320
- For Ida and Albin.
- Cheers!

63
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,450
Something like this.
What do you think?

64
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Looks great.

65
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,080
- Bye.
- Bye.

66
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,660
Hi.

67
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,340
- God, you are sweaty.
- Sorry, I was at the gym with Marie.

68
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,840
- Did you talk about the weekend?
- Sorry, she can't come.

69
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,130
What?

70
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,720
Of course she's coming.

71
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,930
What a relief. I've been
looking forward to this.

72
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,070
Tove is coming too,
so we'll be four girls.

73
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,150
- That's perfect.
- So we can take my car.

74
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,270
Okay, so the guys take the
other car, perfect.

75
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,030
So, who's coming?

76
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,910
Albin and Markus of course. And...
I haven't talked to him.

77
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,770
But can you call and ask at least?

78
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,000
I think he's busy with his friends.
I don't think he wants to.

79
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,330
I don't want you to see him.
He's a player.

80
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,000
You can't say that,
you are siblings.

81
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,840
That's exactly why I know
what he's like.

82
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,890
Okay, but if I promise not to do
anything with him?

83
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,100
What kind of promise is that?

84
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,560
I don't want to, but okay,
<i>I'll</i> call him.

85
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,400
It's gonna be so much fun.
But tell him we are three

86
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,360
single girls that are coming.

87
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
Absolutely, <i>I'll</i> tell him that.

88
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,200
- I have a customer soon, so...
- Okay, I'm leaving. Later, kiss kiss.

89
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,790
- I'm so excited!
- Linnea, I have a surprise for you.

90
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,880
- What is it?
- You'll have to wait and see.

91
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,530
I'm so happy you could make it.
I don't know if I would want

92
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,590
to come along otherwise.

93
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,430
The asshole didn't want to give me
the weekend off at first.

94
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,260
So how did you manage?

95
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,310
I'm not going back anymore.

96
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Marie, tonight you and I are
gonna go all in!

97
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,980
We're gonna get so wasted!

98
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,960
I have a good wine with me, Linnea.
You're gonna love the taste.

99
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,780
It's sweet and dry at the same time.

100
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,570
Okay. I've got liquor.

101
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,530
Marie, you should do wine reviews.

102
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,490
Sweet and dry at the same time.

103
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,200
- Linnea, stop, there is Simon.
- What, is he coming?

104
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,660
Yes, I told him you were coming.

105
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,790
Thanks for the heads up,
I haven't had time to fix myself up.

106
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,520
- Hi sis.
- Hi Simon.

107
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,850
- What's up?
- I'm fine, thanks.

108
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,110
This looks like a promising weekend.

109
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,730
Simon.

110
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,900
- Do I go with you?
- I don't think so.

111
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
But ask Albin if he can drive ahead,
we don't know where to go.

112
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,660
- Okay, <i>I'll</i> tell him. See you there.
- Bye, Simon.

113
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,090
- Hi, Simon.
- Hi.

114
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,670
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

115
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,080
- Good to see you.
- You too.

116
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,630
- This is Markus.
- Hi.

117
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,550
- Hi, Markus.
- Hi, Simon.

118
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,970
Have you... traded up?

119
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,930
- No, this is Olof's car.
- What happened to the Mazda?

120
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,060
I still have it.

121
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,980
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

122
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,360
The girls asked us to drive first.
They didn't seem to know the way.

123
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,900
- Okay.
- Where are we going?

124
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,530
- It's a house that my dad found for us.
- Cool.

125
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,870
It looked promising in the other car.

126
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,330
That sure as shit wasn't three miles.

127
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,170
- Where are we?
- You're so impatient.

128
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,690
- Where are we?
- We just need to go straight in here.

129
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,150
Isn't he hot, Ida's brother?

130
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,110
Shall we?

131
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,820
Abbe, I have a feeling this
is gonna be so much fun.

132
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,570
Yeah, I know.

133
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,160
It sure was a long time since we
got together like this.

134
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,870
- Yeah, as long as Dad keeps his promise.
- You haven't seen the house?

135
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,380
No, I haven't. But it's cool,
he said it was fine.

136
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,230
- How are things with Ida?
- It's good. In fact, better than ever.

137
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,520
<i>I'll</i> have to keep chasing girls myself.
C'mon, what happened to my wingman?

138
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,110
C'mon, I'm always on your side,
you know that.

139
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,200
You have lots to choose from this weekend.
I almost wish I were single.

140
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,990
Look, someone's standing over there.

141
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,040
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

142
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,220
Hi.

143
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,720
Do you want something?

144
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,020
Hey! I'm talking to you! Fucking idiot,
who the hell does he think he is?

145
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,780
Cut it, Simon, maybe he just doesn't want
to talk to you. Take it easy. Let's go.

146
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,330
- What was that about?
- Eh, forget it.

147
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,740
- Shit it's rundown.
- Three doors, that is something new.

148
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,580
All the doors are locked.

149
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,500
Albin, do you have a key?

150
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,290
No.

151
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,340
- How did you think we were gonna get in?
- He didn't think at all.

152
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,350
- I can try and lockpick the door.
- Can you do that?

153
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,680
I had a certain need for
that back in school.

154
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,600
So you have some gypsy in you after all,
I wouldn't have thought that.

155
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,900
Marie, over here.

156
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Come.

157
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,040
- Can't we scare the shit out of Albin?
- Okay, but how?

158
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,290
Look, this window is open.

159
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,396
<i>I'll</i> help you get inside, then you can
open the front door from within.

160
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,840
- But I don't want to go in alone.
- C'mon, you can do it.

161
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,220
If you'll take my bag for me.

162
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,980
- Markus, I can't see anything in here.
- Use your eyes.

163
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,700
"Use your eyes".

164
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,990
This is awesome.

165
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,230
Hello?

166
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,090
Who said I was the best?
Most handsome too, was that you?

167
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,550
- What, is it open?
- Oh, you're so talented, sweetheart.

168
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:47,550
- Let's not exaggerate here.
- Exactly, I would've kicked the door in.

169
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,230
That's great, Simon, then we can be
eaten by mosquitoes all night.

170
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Shall we go in?

171
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,230
- So this is what it looks like.
- Does it smell a little funny in here?

172
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,780
What a place.

173
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,290
- Imagine they just left it like this.
- Yeah, really.

174
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,550
Oh, my God.
Shit, you scared me.

175
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,550
- How the hell did you come in?
- You really startled me.

176
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,350
My idea. We got you good.

177
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,690
- Is there gonne be any action here tonight?
- For sure.

178
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,150
- Wanna check it out upstairs?
- Alright.

179
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,450
- My Dad did great, right?
- Absolutely.

180
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,250
It's been so long since we had a
whole weekend together.

181
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,766
The girls really appreciate this.
And it's good for Tove

182
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,790
to get away from
all her problems for awhile.

183
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,380
- Where are we gonna sleep?
- We're not gonna need that.

184
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,010
We won't be sleeping.

185
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:16,390
It's strange how you can be so different.
My parents would never do anything for us.

186
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,570
I guess. We didn't get to
choose our parents.

187
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,740
Wow. So this is where we're
supposed to sleep tonight?

188
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,460
Pink. That's really my color, isn't it?

189
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,260
- What are you thinking now?
- I don't know. What do you want?

190
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,200
We were suppose to scare Albin,
what happened?

191
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,620
I don't know.
I don't feel so well.

192
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,250
Is it something serious?
C'mon, we're suppose to have a good time,

193
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,420
you can't be sick now.

194
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm sure it'll pass.
I'm going inside.

195
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,350
Mackan, do you want your bag or not?

196
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,770
I'm looking forward to a cold drink.

197
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,840
Guys, Linnea is here.
Screw Markus.

198
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,600
- You might need this.
- Thanks.

199
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,390
It feels really fun to be able to get
together for a weekend again like this,

200
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,690
it's been a long time.

201
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,520
I mean, Marie has been talking about moving
to Japan for like, five years now.

202
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,320
Now you're stuck with us instead.

203
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,860
- All jokes aside, cheers.
- Cheers for Marie.

204
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,340
Tasty.

205
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,910
Marie, been drinking too much already?

206
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,750
I need to go to the bathroom.

207
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,560
Fuck, I feel horrible.

208
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,380
(Low battery level)

209
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,350
You scared me.

210
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,690
Could you move over, Marie?
C'mon, let's head down to the others.

211
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,740
Hello, Marie?

212
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,370
C'mon, answer me.

213
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,030
- Albin, you have to help Linnea.
- What the hell happened?

214
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,670
What the fuck is happening?

215
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Oh, fuck.

216
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,060
Albin, come here!

217
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,810
Get something to tie her with.
Sit still!

218
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,820
Tove, can you hear me?

219
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,950
Oh God, she spit on me.

220
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,920
I found this.

221
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,530
- How is it going?
- Not good. Her upper lip is torn off.

222
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,320
- She needs to go to a hospital.
- I have to help Simon, where is Markus?

223
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,870
I don't know, maybe he
went outside or something.

224
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:38,410
- Hit me. Hit me!
- Shut the fuck up.

225
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,330
Shut up before I knock your teeth out.

226
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,360
Oh, shit.

227
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,780
I have an idea!

228
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,450
- Abbe?
- Where the hell have you been?

229
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,160
- What the hell has happened?
- Stay away.

230
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,000
- Why is she tied up?
- She was totally insane before, okay?

231
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,050
- How did she become like this?
- She came down the stairs and attacked me.

232
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,090
Move over.

233
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,300
Have you seen her eyes?

234
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,520
What happened to you?

235
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Did she get rabies?

236
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,650
Rabies? Do you think you become
like this from rabies?!

237
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,990
- Has she been drugged?
- Have you even tried drugs?

238
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,040
- Don't fucking open the door.
- Mackan, in the kitchen, now.

239
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,420
Close the side door and stand behind me.

240
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,790
- Stay behind me now.
- Give me the towel.

241
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,880
Keep quiet both of you, <i>I'll</i> handle this.

242
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,890
Hey.

243
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,150
Hello there.
Is everything alright in there?

244
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,860
Yes, why wouldn't it be?

245
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,780
I need you to let me in.

246
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,160
Why?

247
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,330
I want to have a look at your friend.

248
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,080
Who the hell are you?

249
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,170
- Have you been spying on us?
- Wait inside.

250
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,930
Let's put it this way, I was nearby and
you people aren't exactly quiet.

251
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,350
Let me in now.

252
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,100
Look, I don't know who you are,
and you're standing here with a rifle.

253
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,140
I want you to leave now.

254
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,150
- That's enough, let me in.
- Okay, just take it easy.

255
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,200
Where is she?

256
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,910
Behind the door.

257
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,030
Hello, can you hear me?

258
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,620
- This girl is dead.
- Are you out of your mind?

259
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,870
She's sitting there, damn it.

260
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:15,550
She has been turned into something else.
It's too late, you have to get rid of her.

261
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,180
Let's take it easy. If you know something
about this, you need to tell us right now.

262
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,230
Back up! I said back up.
Stand over there, let's go.

263
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:43,530
- What are you doing?
- Listen to me now very carefully...

264
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:51,460
A couples of days ago, me, my wife and
daughter were out here in the woods.

265
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,000
Keep in touch when you're getting
ready so we can meet up here again.

266
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,420
Of course. But are you sure
this is alright with you?

267
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,300
Yes, I'm sure. You get the fish
and we'll get the chanterelles.

268
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
<i>Okay.</i>

269
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:11,230
We parted there. I went fishing and
Karin and Lisa went to pick mushrooms.

270
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,060
About chanterelles, you know it's those
yellow things, right?

271
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Yes, dad, I know that.

272
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,110
- Alright, good luck now.
- Take care.

273
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,450
And then they found this fucking house.

274
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,830
I don't know what happened,
but it was something.

275
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:36,750
Her eyes, I can't describe it, but...
It wasn't her.

276
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,960
What exactly do you think you know?

277
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,220
Okay...

278
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,260
My grandfather told me a story
when I was a little kid.

279
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:53,100
About a legend that was about creatures
that lived beneath the ground.

280
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:01,030
I was told that if you trespassed their
lands, things could go very bad.

281
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:10,040
If you saw one of these creature, you
should turn and run as fast as you could.

282
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:20,870
They were so powerful if you gazed into
their eyes, they would take your soul.

283
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,800
- Wait up, old man, is this your theory?
- That's exactly what I mean.

284
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,270
- And that is what has happened in here.
- What happened to your family?

285
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,730
They didn't make it.

286
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,400
Just before Lisa...

287
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,830
She whispered to me...

288
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:57,370
Mom and I found a house. We went in.
We found a basement. Help me Dad...

289
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:09,390
I think your girl suffered the same fate
that my grandfather told me about...

290
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,640
Like my wife and Lisa suffered...

291
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:20,820
- So you're saying Marie has...
- Listen to me now.

292
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,280
This girl is dead. Something has taken her
body. What happens here is dangerous.

293
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,200
You have to call the police.
But the most important thing is...

294
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,910
We get rid of her.

295
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,920
You don't touch Marie,
we have to take her to a hospital.

296
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,670
A doctor can't do anything about this.

297
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,340
Have anyone been in contact with her
since she changed into this?

298
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,890
We've all been near her, why?

299
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,180
I don't understand what you mean.

300
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,270
I mean, if anyone has gotten any blood on
themselves, or has been scratched or bitten?

301
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,400
What has that got to do with anything?

302
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,320
Once you've been exposed,
it spreads easily.

303
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,240
We have to get rid of her.

304
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,500
Preferably, burn her.

305
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,960
Of course we're not gonna do that.
I have to call an ambulance.

306
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,400
Shoot her!

307
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:33,360
Stay back.

308
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,330
- Are you okay?
- What happened, where is Tove?

309
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,186
She went completely crazy and attacked me.
She jumped out the window.

310
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,920
This can't be fucking happening.

311
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,260
- Where are you going?
- Ida, come now, we're leaving.

312
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,390
Simon, wait.
I have to call the police.

313
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,600
Come on.

314
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,810
Simon, if we're getting out of here,
everyone needs to come along.

315
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,940
I don't give a shit about
the others, okay?

316
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,400
Do as I say for once and get going.

317
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,650
We need help, I don't know exactly
what's going on but...

318
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,660
- You don't have a choice, okay?
- Simon, release her.

319
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,410
Excuse me, you want something?

320
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,080
You heard me, it's not up to you
to decide what Ida should do.

321
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,976
I talked to the police and they told
me that someone has to go

322
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,170
- and meet them by the cars.
- Fine. I guess I'm going.

323
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,750
Stay here and fucking rot.

324
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,090
<i>I'll</i> go with you.

325
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,680
Yeah, that's gonna be fun.

326
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,550
You're the last person on
earth I want with me.

327
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,010
<i>I'll go.</i>

328
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,100
No, you're gonna stay here.

329
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,100
It's okay. It's better if we are two,
it's gonna be fine.

330
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,980
Let's go.

331
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Sweetheart, it's gonna be okay,
I promise. Be careful now.

332
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,990
Yes, Daddy.

333
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,500
- Hello? Are you still there?
- Hello?

334
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,600
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

335
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,000
- What did you decide?
- Two guys are meeting you by our cars.

336
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,340
Where are you going?

337
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,470
I'm just gonna check something out.

338
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,720
Do you really have to?

339
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,020
Just over here.

340
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,640
Keep close to me.

341
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,870
- Here, take this.
- What am I suppose to do with it?

342
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,840
You never know.

343
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,560
<i>I'll</i> take this.

344
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,140
What is this?

345
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,030
No, are those birds? Oh, shit.

346
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,330
Have they eaten each other?

347
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,630
Let's go.

348
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,380
I'm coming.

349
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,780
Motherfucking idiot.

350
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,200
Now you son of a bitch.

351
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,960
Hold that rifle for me.

352
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,420
Fucking shit, hell.

353
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,140
Wait up, Simon,
I can't keep up with you.

354
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:28,980
We can't stop now, come on.

355
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,150
I can't see anything when you're
walking ahead with the flashlight.

356
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,150
There are fucking stones everywhere.

357
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,570
Okay, come here.
Let's stick together.

358
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,380
This is probably the wrong
time to ask but...

359
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,590
What?

360
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,630
Wait a second.

361
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,800
What's the matter?

362
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,300
It's not very good.

363
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,861
I know you feel a bit shocked because
of everything that has happened.

364
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:14,440
Marie and Tove,
I barely know them but...

365
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,070
I feel a bit down myself.

366
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,280
It's gonna be alright.

367
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,370
We're on our way to the police now.

368
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:31,040
It didn't turn out the way we planned.

369
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:39,130
- Oh, shit, stay there.
- What is it?

370
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,260
Don't come any fucking closer.

371
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,180
I said stay there.

372
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:47,060
- Simon, what's wrong?
- I go, you stay.

373
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,640
Are you insane?
You can't just leave me here.

374
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,320
What the fuck.

375
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,690
I told you to stay away.

376
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,760
I don't feel so good.
I have to lie down.

377
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,840
Do you want something to drink?

378
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,070
- I'm screwed, right?
- Mackan, drink this.

379
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:18,210
Mackan, listen to me now. The police
are gonna be here soon.

380
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,580
Everything's gonna be alright.

381
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:25,340
- Mackan, it's gonna be alright.
- Why the hell are you still here?

382
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:29,380
Listen, the police are
gonna be here soon.

383
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,150
- Marie is gone.
- What do you mean, gone?

384
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,660
Markus, you need to get up now.

385
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,290
Damn, I'm bleeding.

386
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,760
- Was that Marie?
- I don't know.

387
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,440
What do we do?

388
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,320
Wait.

389
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
Ida, stay there now.

390
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:07,290
Albin, you fucking cunt,
get over here!

391
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,170
No!

392
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,330
Honey, look at me.

393
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:36,670
We got to go now, we can't wait
any longer. Where is your phone?

394
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,380
On the sofa, I think.

395
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:52,770
- Okay, let's go.
- Weren't we suppose to wait?

396
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,850
No, we need to get out of here, we
need to go through the woods.

397
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,950
Albin, get up.
We have to go now.

398
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,830
Fuck, this isn't gonna work.
Get inside again.

399
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:40,770
Ida!

400
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:55,830
Ida. Where are you?

401
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:15,140
Ida. Open the door.

402
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:21,890
- Open the door.
- Simon, are the police with you?

403
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,900
Where is Linnea?

404
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:33,200
I said, open it!

405
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,490
Open it!

406
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,920
Fuck.

407
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,510
Come on, fucker!

408
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:55,970
Come on!

409
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:59,240
Forgive me, Linnea.

410
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:02,990
I didn't know what I was doing.

411
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,210
Please, don't do it.

412
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,130
Please!

413
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,210
No, Linnea, Please.

414
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:21,050
He's still outside.
I think it's Markus.

415
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:01,470
It's too high up,
we're gonna break our necks.

416
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,310
We need to get out,
It's our only chance.

417
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,930
How? We're never gonna
get out of here.

418
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,960
Okay, honey, let's do like this.

419
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,260
We can't wait for the police anymore.

420
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,590
I'm gonna loosen the ropes now.

421
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:46,430
If Markus is outside
I'm gonna hit him immediately.

422
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:50,020
Stay right behind me and don't do
anything before I say so.

423
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,730
- Okay.
- Okay.

424
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,220
<i>Okay.</i>

425
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:27,350
We're not gonna see shit in the woods, but
we'll get through this. Are you ready?

426
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,690
Okay, let's do it.

427
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,510
Ida, down.
Go down the stairs.

428
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:15,390
Linnea?

429
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,400
Ida, get up again.
Get up!

430
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,830
Try to find another way out!

431
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,810
Up! Up!

432
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,710
Ida, fuck that, Ida!

433
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:24,830
Ida!

434
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,400
Albin!

435
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:37,570
We need to go. We need to go.

436
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:41,540
- <i>I'll</i> be right behind you.
- I can't do it.

437
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,710
<i>I'll</i> be right there. Hurry!

438
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,920
Simon. Simon!

439
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:22,720
Simon, come here!

440
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:20,500
Ida!

441
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:29,110
Ida. Ida!

442
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,320
Ida. Honey.

443
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:18,450
Can you hear me?
Say something.

444
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:10,960
Fuck!

445
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:30,060
Fuck!

446
01:24:56,780 --> 01:25:01,700
Albin. Albin.

447
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:13,210
Honey?

448
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:58,270
Fuck! Fuck!

449
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:31,650
No, no, no!

450
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:16,360
Die!
