Good.

3
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:17,256
Could've slept
an extra 20 minutes, man.

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,987
Well, now we have plenty of time
to eat our breakfast.

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,785
(groaning)
Huh? What do you want,

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,019
you want the onion or do you
want the everything?

7
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:25,918
I know what you want,
you want that everything.

8
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:27,951
There you go. Eat that up.
(yawning)

9
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:29,886
Okay.

10
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:33,925
Uh, there's no cream cheese.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,126
Well, they must have forgotten it.
And you forgot to check

12
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,761
because you were
in such a rush to get here

13
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:39,496
so we could be early, right?

14
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,530
Well, being early is not
going to kill you, Travis.

15
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,931
You know what I'm going to do?
Take a nap.

16
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:47,334
Wait for everyone else
to get here.

17
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:51,639
You know, being early
is better than being late.

I don't want to be late.
I want to be on time.

yourself a cushion

Wes, something going wrong

22

is a perfectly valid
excuse to be late.

23
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:03,886

you're late.

147
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,354
The way she talked
about him, it wasn't

148
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:22,889
author-subject, you know?
He's a genius, all that crap.

149
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:24,458
I think there's more.

150
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:27,360
Meanwhile,
back at the evidence...

151
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:29,897
I went full-out, Wes--
I gave her the smile,

152
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:32,599
the eye contact,
the empathetic nods...

153
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:34,368
Far be it for me to discredit
the forensic value

154
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:35,702
of the empathetic nod.

155
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:37,137
I'm telling you, if there
was anything in there,

156
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,373
they would have found
the cash 10 years ago.

157
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:41,041
Oh, yeah? So, you're saying
your not smarter

158
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,809
than any other cop
that's worked this case?

159
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,546
I'm smarter than at least one.

160
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,014

00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:52,251
Okay, robber here, caught here.

162
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,553
Which means Cooper
couldn't have gone

163
00:07:54,587 --> 00:07:57,723
outside this area
to hide his money.

164
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:00,559
You're already wrong.

165
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:03,462
The money had to be
at least 50 pounds. Thank you.

166
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:06,931
A man can't run much farther
than that with that much weight.

167
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:10,635
Five million dollars
weighs 110 pounds exactly.

168
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,637
Just... let me finish.
How do you...

169
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,506
So he couldn't have gone
any further that that.

170
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,408
But after he dumped it,
he still had to

171
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,543
make it to
where he was caught.

172
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:25,116
And that's a row
of office buildings.

173
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,785
What'd he do, hide it in
a plant for ten years?

174
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,754
Yeah, I don't know.
But I just

175
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:31,790
turned your big-ass circle
into one square block.

176
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:33,491
Here's the money.

177
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:34,826
Yeah, if it's anywhere.

178
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:41,366
That's a lot of office buildings.
Yeah, but what isn't there?

179
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,504
The Spencer building, that big
hideous glass building.

180
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:48,539
Oh, right, okay.

181
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:52,009
It says here, construction
started in November of '01.

182
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:53,858
Okay, that's three months
before the robbery.

183
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:54,879
Mm-hm.

184
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,383
So if Cooper's back in town,
that's where he's going.

185
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:01,819
TRAVIS: Glad I solved it.
No wait-wait-wait-wait-wait...

186
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,454
You gave up like
three minutes ago.

187
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:06,457
And then I solved it. Yeah.

188
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm a wizard.

189
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:10,695
I am videotaping
our next conversation.

190
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:26,509
Keep it out front.
We're LAPD.

191
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:28,711
You just going to go
knocking on walls?

192
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:30,146
Well, we'll take
a look downstairs,

193
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:31,648
find out if anyone's
seen him.

194
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:33,350
Yeah, it's a long shot.

195
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:35,185
No, it's the only
shot we got.

196
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:41,892
How you doing today?

197
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:43,527
(sighs)
I'd rather be outside.

198
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:45,163
But other than that,
I'm all right.

199
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:48,099
Mm! I hear that.

200
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:49,534
Oh, the empathetic
head nod.

201
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:51,336
Good God.

202
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,937
We're detectives
with the LAPD

203
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:54,505
and we'd like
to see your basement.

204
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,773
Yeah, knock yourself out.

205
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:57,742
The other detective,
he's already down there.

206
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,081
TRAVIS: I can't believe
I was right.

207
00:10:03,115 --> 00:10:05,684
Say it again,
I'm going to shoot you.

208
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:07,586
If I were dead, you'd finally
be a better cop than me.

209
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,653
(mocking laugh)

210
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:15,427
(fire alarm blares)

211
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:19,064
You all right?!

212
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,800
Cooper?!

213
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,301
(gunfire)

214
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:24,969
Go! Go!

215
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:30,608
Fire alarm...
WES: LAPD! Move! Move!

216
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:31,576
TRAVIS: LAPD!

217
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,611
(gun cocks)

218
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:38,083
Where is it?!
Where is it?!

219
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:39,751
(engine roars,
tires screech)

220
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,508
(applause)
AMY: Nice work, gentlemen.

221
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,825
KATE: Did they valet your car?

222
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,200
Please tell me they
valeted your car. (chuckles)

223
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,461
Okay, a little respect here.

224
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,195
We solved a 10-year-old
case in five minutes.

225
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,531
Listen to this: "From the moment
Cooper strode into the room,

226
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:56,698
"you could tell
he was different.

227
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:57,933
"He had the breezy insouciance

228
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,368
of a movie star who
just won his third Oscar."

229
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:01,770
Wow, that is bad writing.

230
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:05,307
W-W-Wait, this is why I got
nothing from her, man.

231
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:06,577
She's in love with him.

232
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:07,976
A woman turning you down
isn't evidence of anything.

233
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,844
But taste.

234
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:14,115
A guy's in prison for years,

235
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,119
this ten walks in and fawns all over...
Thought she was a seven.

236
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:18,120
It's a prison ten.

237
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:19,488
It makes sense.

238
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:22,291
She's his only connection
on the outside.

239
00:11:22,326 --> 00:11:25,495
And she's clearly crazy for him.
Says you.

240
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,965
Hey, Captain, we, uh, wanted to...
Shh!

241
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:36,474
On your case...

242
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:37,842
I found the car.

243
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,644
It was dumped
by a Metro station

244
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:41,512
about two miles from
where you lost them.

245
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:43,181
No sign of Cooper.
WES: We were close.

246
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:45,316
(groans)
Almost good work, boys.

247
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:47,786
Thanks, Cap.
Amazing you got what you did.

248
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,056
We were...
Almost caught him, I know.

249
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:56,128
Any ideas how we can
catch him for reals?

250
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:58,463
Nothing...

251
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:01,199
solid... no.

252
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:04,169
Except for the author--
Lisa Clark.

253
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:08,975
We, uh, we think there's
a relationship there.

254
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,043
We think he may try to make
contact; try to use her.

255
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:15,348
It's possible.
Thanks for the support.

256
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:16,465
I said it's possible.

257
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,484
No, no, no, 
I'm not appreciated.

258
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:21,220
WES: Give me a break. It's your support.
TRAVIS: Thank you, so supportive.

259
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:23,990
Nah, well, I try...
SUTTON: You were right once.

260
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:26,192
All right, so you got it.

261
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:28,461
We'll set up surveillance
and split the shifts

262
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:29,996
with Kate and Amy.

263
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:33,066
Captain, we feel good about
this, don't we, partner?

264
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,302
Yeah.
All right, fellas, look,

265
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:37,237
this is a textbook example

266
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,473
of a challenging task.

267
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,475
What do you say?

268
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,912
We close our eyes,
and we visualize

269
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:46,648
a positive outcome together.

270
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,683
Come on.

271
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,300
(chuckles)

272
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,441
(clears throat)

273
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:14,775
Hey, sweetheart.

274
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,044
How's your day going?

275
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:20,213
Good, good.

276
00:13:20,248 --> 00:13:22,382
Hey, listen,
I been thinking, uh,

277
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,719
after I was meditating,
and I had an epiphany.

278
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:32,292
How about you and I
have a date night?

279
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,596
MANAGER:
It's our best executive unit.

280
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,633
Everything is top of the line.

281
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:42,202
Oh, there is one thing:

282
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:44,071
The sauna's being retiled.

283
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:46,207
Hm.

284
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,775
So?
MANAGER: It's just, um...

285
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,212
Male tenants living together
tend to enjoy the sauna.

286
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:53,547
Hm.

287
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,549
Um...

288
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,486
We're not...
Sauna people, no.

289
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,554
Girl, he gets a heat rash, oh.

290
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,923
Don't you?

291
00:14:01,957 --> 00:14:03,391
My little sensitive man.

292
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:06,195
I'll let you boys settle in.

293
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,601
Why are you pretending
we're gay? Will you stop it?

294
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,069
It's our cover.

295
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,171
Now, no one knows we're cops.

296
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,942
Great.

297
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:20,476
All right, the home phone
and the cell phone

298
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:21,978
are already tapped.

299
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:24,313
Our tech overheard
her saying she's got

300
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,514
a doctor's appointment

301
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,583
this afternoon, so we can
get on in there

302
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,184
and plant a bug then.

303
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:30,919
Yes, I did get a warrant.

304
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,422
Even though, no, you don't care.

305
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,525
All right.

306
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:43,198
So, I've got our friend
at her computer.

307
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,900
And, uh...

308
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:49,605
Ooh, it's yoga time!

309
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,874
While she's writing?

310
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:53,009
No, it's her neighbor.

311
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:59,449
Travis, now what
you're doing is illegal.

312
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,851
Ooh, Ooh...

313
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:05,821
This should be illegal
what she is doing to me-- uh!

314
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:08,657
Man, if I bent like that,
I'd snap in half.

315
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,228
Bird of Paradise pose.

316
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,596
She needs to drop her hip
and point her toes.

317
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,468
You can take the joy
out of anything.

318
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,670
Thank you.

319
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:31,580
Man, you cook this well and
still can't get a woman?

320
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:35,551
You know how to
bury a compliment.

321
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:38,820
And I've cooked for you before.
With Alex, but...

322
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,522
I always thought
she did the cooking

323
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:41,923
and you took all the credit.

324
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,595
Lisa's on the move.

325
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,896
Carter, this is Mitchell.

326
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,764
(over radio):
Target is leaving her apartment.

327
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:53,333
We'll pick her up when she
clears the building.

328
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,201
All right, copy that.

329
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:57,837
All right, that should
buy us at least a half an hour.

330
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:59,772
She's leaving early.
I knew I didn't like her.

331
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,102
Okay, now listen to me.
You listening?

332
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:02,642
Mm-hm.

333
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:05,078
This is not a toy;
this is a delicate tool.

334
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:08,281
Do not scrunch, twist,
crinkle, bend...

335
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,083
I've planted a bug before.

336
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:12,552
Can you at least
wash your hands first?

337
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,054
Yeah, all right.
That's delicate.

338
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:16,756
Yeah... all right.

339
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,193
I'll be back.

340
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:23,262
Just, uh...
(door closes)

341
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:24,530
Just leave
that anywhere, Travis.

342
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:25,665
No, I'll get it later.

343
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:43,950
Okay... now we're going
to plant this bug,

344
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:46,452
and we're going to
get out of there...

345
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,855
Right, Travis?

346
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:51,591
Travis?

347
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:55,662
Travis, can you hear me?

348
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:57,531
(cell phone rings)

349
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:01,302
Yeah.

350
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,270
WES:
Put in your earpiece!

351
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,276
Okay, can you hear me?

352
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,412
Yeah, I can hear you.
Testing...

353
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,649
Please don't say testing, one, two...
One, two, three...

354
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,751
(sighs)
Where you going?

355
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,286
Why are you going
into the kitchen?

356
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,456
See if she's got
some of these cookies.

357
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:23,325
Travis, you can't go in for
cookies right now.

358
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,993
We're on a stakeout.
You're planting a bug.

359
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,061
We're on a schedule.
You got to do this thing.

360
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:31,098
(chuckles)
Okay...

361
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,933
When you're finished
with your cookies,

362
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,135
remember to put this thing
someplace high up.

363
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,637
Preferably not near
a wire in the wall.

364
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,776
Bingo.

365
00:17:43,811 --> 00:17:45,478
Letters from Cooper.

366
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:50,583
All right.
Anything interesting?

367
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:55,656
Well, they were all
read by the prison,

368
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,290
so there wouldn't be.

369
00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:59,326
But the fact that she kept them
proves my point.

370
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,862
CARTER: Mitchell. Mitchell.
You there?

371
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:03,671
Target just turned
around and is heading home.

372
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:04,397
All right, copy that.

373
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:06,500
Hey, Travis, you got to
get out of there.

374
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:08,168
She's on her way back
to the apartment.

375
00:18:08,202 --> 00:18:09,869
You got to hurry hurry, okay?

376
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:13,840
Come on, get it,
get it, get it going.

377
00:18:17,177 --> 00:18:18,511
WES:
You got it up there?

378
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,479
Travis?

379
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,548
Travis, I'm not getting anything
out of your microphone.

380
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:23,849
You want to check your mic?

381
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,688
Check your mic!
I don't know what you're saying!

382
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,256
Tra... something's wrong
with your microphone.

383
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,690
Check your mic.

384
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:33,825
What is in that?!

385
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:35,827
Why are you holding that?!

386
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,595
Put it down!
Get out of the apartment.

387
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:39,897
I don't know why you're
shaking the box around.

388
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,866
What does that mean? I can't...
(thud)

389
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:45,937
I heard that. Are you...?

390
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:47,338
Are you moving
your lips right now?

391
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:48,606
You're not saying anything?

392
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,575
Good work, Detective.
Good work.

393
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,277
(chuckles)

394
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:04,257
WES: Okay, all right,
where's the remote?

395
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:10,364
You know, this thing
goes in a cradle.

396
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:12,867
Can I just tell you,
you've outdone yourself.

397
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,535
I mean, you should have
your own show,

398
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,970
<i>The Anal Chef.</i>

399
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,741
Don't miss.

400
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:25,412
(doorbell rings)

401
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:27,214
Are you expecting anyone?

402
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:28,948
Kate and Amy aren't supposed
to be here till 10:00.

403
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:37,123
(raspy laugh)
Mr. T!

404
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:40,927
Let's get this party started.

405
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:42,061
Captain.

406
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:44,631
SUTTON:
Hey, Wes, my man.

407
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:47,901
Ah, you guys ate already.

408
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,170
Eh, that's all right.

409
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:51,839
I bet I can finish this
chicken all on my own.

410
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:54,575
Is there really a winner
in a bet like that, Cap?

411
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,943
(chuckles)
Any progress?

412
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,411
Not really, no.

413
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,146
Uh, kind of a dead end.

414
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,381
Drink up, me hearties.

415
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,919
Probably shouldn't on duty.

416
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,320
Near beer.

417
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:09,023
Come on, what kind of
a captain do you think I am?

418
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:10,825
Everything okay at home, sir?

419
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,259
You kiddin' me?
Couldn't be better.

420
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,995
This therapy saved our lives.

421
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:15,864
I don't have to tell
you guys that.

422
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:18,867
No, no, you don't, uh,
'cause you forced us to go.

423
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,703
"Forced" is a strong word.
WES: It is a strong word.

424
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:24,339
It is.
It's what happened, though.

425
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:28,109
WES: When is he going to leave?
I don't think he ever is.

426
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,111
WES: If you're wrong
about this and Cooper

427
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,479
never tries to contact Lisa,

428
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:32,848
we're stuck
with him, forever.

429
00:20:32,882 --> 00:20:34,650
No, no, no, don't even say that.
Don't even put

430
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:36,618
that thought out there
in the universe.

431
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,487
Hey, boys, we're going
to need some more beer.

432
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,569
TRAVIS: I'll go!
No, I'll go get that for ya.

433
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,481
WES (whispers): Don't you dare
go get that....

434
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:44,506
What, the hell you will,
shoot for it.

435
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,428
(whispers) No!
(exclaims)

436
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,902
(sighs)

437
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,404
Wes, my man.

438
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:57,339
(patting seat)
Park it.

439
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,411
So, you were telling me
about your parents.

440
00:21:02,445 --> 00:21:04,546
Was I?

441
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:05,848
Kind of doubt it.

442
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:08,217
Probably wouldn't surprise
you to find out

443
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:10,152
that my old man was
a heavy drinker, huh?

444
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,220
(wry laugh)

445
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:13,089
I mean, I told him
I loved him once.

446
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:14,857
I actually said the words,

447
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:20,430
"I love you," to which he
responded, "I love food, too."

448
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:22,065
He never let me in.

449
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:23,033
(intercom buzzes)

450
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,768
Never once.

451
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:27,038
Hey, Cap, was that a call?
DOORMAN: Pizza's on his way up, ma'am.

452
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:29,073
Nah, it's just the doorman
letting the pizza guy up.

453
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:30,842
Did she call for a pizza?

454
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:32,844
Travis, you better get in there.

455
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:34,346
Guy just delivered pizza.

456
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,415
<i>It could be Cooper.</i>

457
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:45,057
Freeze.

458
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:48,894
Don't move. Don't move.

459
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:55,033
I've got like
three bucks.

460
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,302
Take it.

461
00:21:57,336 --> 00:21:59,471
All right, just relax.

462
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:01,039
I'm a cop.
(elevator bell dings)

463
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:03,307
Yeah, 'cause police
never shoot anyone.

464
00:22:17,923 --> 00:22:19,157
Okay.

465
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:21,159
Who put the note
in the box?

466
00:22:21,193 --> 00:22:24,062
Some guy was waiting for me
outside the shop.

467
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:26,194
He gave me 100 bucks
to put it in here.

468
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:26,832
Whoa.

469
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,901
You told me you only had
three dollars, you little liar.

470
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:30,937
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Now, here's
what you're going to do.

471
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,639
You're going to take this box,
you're going to

472
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:34,274
deliver it
to the person who ordered it,

473
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:36,009
and you're not going to tell her
anything about us.

474
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:37,578
You understand?

475
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:39,613
Put the microphone pen
on him so he doesn't talk.

476
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:40,848
Microphone pen?
Yeah.

477
00:22:40,882 --> 00:22:42,583
We only have
one microphone pen.

478
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:44,284
You sure you want to waste it?
They're expensive.

479
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,487
Put it on him. He's a liar.
Hey, all right. Relax.

480
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:52,994
Remember.

481
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,298
We're listening.

482
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:05,597
Cooper sent a note.

483
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:06,910
What'd it say?

484
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:08,412
It said, "Meet me
in MacArthur Park

485
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:10,314
at 6:00 p.m.
tomorrow."

486
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,715
Yep.

487
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:15,052
Travis, you were right--
she's in on it.

488
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:16,653
Was I?

489
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,488
I guess I was.

490
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:21,391
Listen, I'm not going to gloat
about it, guys, all right?

491
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:22,760
Thank you.

492
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:25,829
So I'll just simply
say, uh, you know...

493
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,131
Touchdown!

494
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,613
Are you done?

495
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:44,615
Wait.

496
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,517
I'm done now.

497
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:54,791
Uh, before we get started,

498
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:57,760
I did want to check in
on a couple of things.

499
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:00,162
Clyde, how is our new
strategy going?

500
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:01,764
It's not bad.

501
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:03,199
Uh, every time I get a,
uh, frustrated thought,

502
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,967
I count to ten
before I say it.

503
00:24:06,637 --> 00:24:08,972
Oh, no, no, no, we're still
having the same fights.

504
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:11,040
They're just lasting longer now.

505
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,842
Clyde, would you say
that was fair?

506
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:17,479
Oh. He's counting.

507
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:19,783
Still a little work to do.

508
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:21,318
TRAVIS: I, uh...
I've got something.

509
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:26,023
Wes and I
have moved in together.

510
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:27,958
Hey! Congrats.

511
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:29,393
Well, we're working on
a stakeout together.

512
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:30,695
Not really
living together.

513
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:32,163
RYAN:
Either way,

514
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:33,698
I see it as an opportunity
to work

515
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:35,333
on some of the roadblocks
the two of you have.

516
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:36,668
How is it going?
TRAVIS: It's been...

517
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:38,370
it's been great.
It's been great.

518
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:40,639
Let's... you know what,
let's start with his cooking.

519
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:42,807
Ladies, don't let Wes
cook for your husbands,

520
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:44,676
or you'll lose them.

521
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,177
(laughter) And, I mean, I'm...
I'm that guy

522
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:47,712
who's always lived alone,

523
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:49,247
but there's something great
about being able

524
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,416
to flip on the game
and having someone there

525
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:54,153
to argue about it with.

526
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:55,855
You done?
Yeah.

527
00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:57,256
WES: I don't want,
uh, anyone in the room

528
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,524
to think I'm
exaggerating here

529
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,594
when I say that Travis...

530
00:25:01,628 --> 00:25:05,264
Travis here is, uh,
the worst roommate

531
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:07,665
anyone has ever had.

532
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,233
He never
offered to help

533
00:25:09,268 --> 00:25:11,035
with the cooking
or the shopping.

534
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,170
I guess he figures there's
some magical kitchen elf

535
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:14,505
that just makes food appear.

536
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,106
TRAVIS:
That's not...

537
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,008
WES:
When the meal is done,

538
00:25:18,043 --> 00:25:20,177
he just, uh, drops the plate
wherever he's standing.

539
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:23,014
I guess he wants me
to clean that up.

540
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:25,116
The only time he's seen
the inside of the kitchen

541
00:25:25,151 --> 00:25:28,220
is, uh, when he hid in
there when we had a guest.

542
00:25:28,254 --> 00:25:29,521
Okay, you hid
in there, too, man.

543
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:30,956
I practically live in there!

544
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:32,692
Glasses sweating

545
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:34,060
all over every tabletop.

546
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:36,363
Used tissues
littering the room.

547
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:38,098
He is like
this selfish,

548
00:25:38,132 --> 00:25:42,402
destructive... monster

549
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:45,739
just leaving a trail
of carnage in his wake.

550
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:47,574
And the worst
part about it is,

551
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:49,809
I've seen his apartment,
and it's spotless.

552
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:52,078
He knows how to clean--
or maybe he makes

553
00:25:52,112 --> 00:25:55,015
the parade of women he has
over there clean up for him.

554
00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:59,219
Okay.

555
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,054
Well, I think it's fair to say

556
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,323
that you both
had different experiences.

557
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:06,593
And you've been
silently harboring all of this,

558
00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:08,428
just waiting

559
00:26:08,462 --> 00:26:10,597
to vomit it all
out in therapy.

560
00:26:10,631 --> 00:26:12,265
No wonder you and Alex
didn't work out.

561
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,367
Nobody has any idea
what you're thinking!

562
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,442
Should I start talking
about how it went

563
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:26,111
putting on my listening
ears this week?

564
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:31,782
(door opens)

565
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,184
Hey, guys.

566
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,452
Totally quiet.

567
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:35,920
KATE:
We'll set up

568
00:26:35,954 --> 00:26:37,421
in the park about 5:30.

569
00:26:37,456 --> 00:26:39,623
FBI is set up in the hotel
across the street.

570
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:41,091
They've got agents
as homeless guys.

571
00:26:41,126 --> 00:26:42,326
Whole nine yards.

572
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,627
Good.
Fine.

573
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,097
Everything all right
with you two?

574
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:48,866
Good.
Fine.

575
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,369
Okay.

576
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:54,539
Have fun locked up
here together all day.

577
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:57,609
I'll be in the kitchen.

578
00:26:57,643 --> 00:27:00,178
Let me know if you need
any help finding it.

579
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:01,680
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
With the Marcelini team

580
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:03,315
taking a nice lead as a group,

581
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:06,452
two-three coming off
a downward trend there.

582
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:09,321
(announcer continues
indistinctly)

583
00:27:09,356 --> 00:27:11,390
They had a great
climbing day yesterday.

584
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:13,292
Really worked as a team
really well

585
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:15,361
and got Marcelini
right in front.

586
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:17,130
If you're waiting
for me to clean up,

587
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:18,898
you can keep waiting.

588
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:20,466
That's great.

589
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:23,403
I love it like this.

590
00:27:23,437 --> 00:27:24,737
...that long, uphill stretch.

591
00:27:24,772 --> 00:27:26,205
What'd you do to the TV?

592
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,575
Did you do something
to the remote?

593
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:30,243
Hmm?

594
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:32,012
Oh, you took
the batteries out.

595
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:33,747
Okay.

596
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:36,249
That's fine.

597
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:38,485
Um, I like bike...

598
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,922
the Tour de Whatever.

599
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:42,490
You hate it.

600
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:45,460
Which makes me love it more.

601
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,364
Don't you touch it.

602
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:50,833
Hey, Ice King, not everybody

603
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:52,701
wants to see their breath
indoors.

604
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:54,503
It's a perfect 72 degrees
in here right now.

605
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:55,738
Not anymore.

606
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:57,173
Travis, if you're cold,

607
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,742
you can put
another layer on.

608
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:00,677
If I'm hot,
I got to suffer.

609
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:02,846
You what?

610
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,382
I suffer.

611
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,050
We can do it all day.

612
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:08,785
I'll do it
all day, man.

613
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:11,354
Ow.

614
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,823
(bell dings)

615
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,263
What is that?

616
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,298
Chicken parm.

617
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,006
Isn't that, uh...
isn't that your favorite?

618
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,745
I suppose you
didn't make me any.

619
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,347
Good work, Detective.

620
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,818
She's going.

621
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,587
Early again.

622
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:46,756
(mouth full):
You must love her.

623
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,926
Good God.

624
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,095
Needs salt.

625
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:57,599
MAN (over radio):
FBI in position.

626
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:02,271
WOMAN (over radio):
LAPD in position.

627
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,847
WES (over radio):
Amy, you got eyes on her?

628
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,883
We got her.

629
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,422
Okay.

630
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,758
So, she was a little squirrelly
on the ride over here.

631
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,293
Something might be off.
Uh-huh.

632
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,295
We definitely
shouldn't move in

633
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,097
till we know it's, uh,
Cooper, all right?

634
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,132
Mm-hmm.

635
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,136
Good talk.

636
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,571
You both really
blend in here nicely.

637
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Hey, I got a jogger.

638
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,216
(over radio):
All agents, this is Valtini.

639
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,484
Get ready
to move in on my...

640
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,719
Can we just make sure?

641
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,721
Is it him? Is it Cooper?

642
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,256
I can't get a clear view.

643
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,997
AMY:
I see him.

644
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,065
It's not him.
Repeat, not Cooper.

645
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,167
Pick him up.
Make sure.

646
00:30:04,201 --> 00:30:05,868
AMY:
She's heading back to her car.

647
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:07,237
We'll stay with her.

648
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:12,008
Thanks for wasting
our time.

649
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:16,412
You see what's
going on here?

650
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,180
She's playing us, man.

651
00:30:18,214 --> 00:30:20,616
She's testing to see if
she's being followed.

652
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,759
What happened in here?

653
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:32,062
Do you slobs expect us
to clean up after you?

654
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,666
I'm teaching Travis a lesson.

655
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,501
TRAVIS:
I'm driving Wes crazy

656
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,104
while he's trying
to teach Travis a lesson.

657
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:41,106
It's like a million degrees
in here.

658
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,840
Seriously?

659
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,342
Hey. You weren't here.

660
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,110
You don't know what he's like.

661
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,545
So, what was all that
in the park?

662
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,080
(sighs)

663
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,015
I think it was a test.

664
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,717
We know this
Cooper's careful.

665
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,685
He wanted to make sure
Lisa wasn't being followed,

666
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,554
so he set this whole thing up.

667
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:59,122
(knock at door)

668
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:03,126
WES: Did someone buzz up?
TRAVIS: No, no calls.

669
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:10,732
It's him.
Cooper's in the apartment.

670
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:16,604
(gun fires)

671
00:31:16,638 --> 00:31:18,673
What just happened?

672
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:23,144
She shot him.

673
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,200
TRAVIS:
Self-defense?

674
00:31:25,674 --> 00:31:26,874
You murdered him
in cold blood.

675
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:28,142
I was watching.

676
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:29,877
You two warned me.

677
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:31,179
This was a dangerous felon.

678
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:32,747
Now, I keep a registered gun,

679
00:31:32,781 --> 00:31:34,014
and when he showed up

680
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,416
and lunged at me,
I defended myself.

681
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,351
He opened his
arms to hug you.

682
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:38,819
And he looked
confused,

683
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:40,655
and you shot him.

684
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:42,090
Maybe that's
what it looked like,

685
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:43,825
but it's not what happened.

686
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,060
What about the
note in the pizza

687
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:47,595
and the meet in the park?

688
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:49,029
I'm a crime writer.

689
00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:50,865
You wouldn't believe
the kooky ways

690
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:52,400
people try to get
in contact with me.

691
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:53,701
You saved the note.

692
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:55,903
Well, I save
all the letters I get.

693
00:31:55,938 --> 00:31:58,672
You never know
what will come in handy.

694
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:00,107
Here's what I think.

695
00:32:00,142 --> 00:32:02,777
I think you two fell in love.

696
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:05,279
He breaks out-- hell, maybe
you help him break out.

697
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:07,047
Maybe you planted
that gun.

698
00:32:07,082 --> 00:32:09,850
And when he busts out and gets
the money and he comes to you

699
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:11,551
and says "Let's run away
together," you think,

700
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:13,553
"What kind of life
is living on the run?

701
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:19,059
If I shoot him,
I get all the money."

702
00:32:19,094 --> 00:32:21,295
I know how this all must look,

703
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:26,034
but I'm as surprised as you are
that he showed up.

704
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:27,836
Sorry.

705
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:31,673
You have any
questions, partner?

706
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,181
No, I'm good.

707
00:32:41,852 --> 00:32:43,987
Hey, I saw her murder him.

708
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:45,622
If I tried
to indict her,

709
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:47,790
I'd get laughed out
of the grand jury.

710
00:32:47,825 --> 00:32:49,426
You have a cop
as an eyewitness!

711
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,128
I've got an escaped
con carrying a gun

712
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:53,496
breaking into
her apartment.

713
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,964
Okay, what about the money?

714
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:56,266
That's the FBI's problem.

715
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,767
Missing money's
still missing money.

716
00:32:57,802 --> 00:32:59,636
Captain, I'm telling you,
there is more to this

717
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,970
You got to believe me.

718
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,739
I'm sorry, guys.

719
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:04,107
You got Cooper.

720
00:33:04,142 --> 00:33:06,710
And your instincts
were right.

721
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:18,355
Travis.

722
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:20,591
Travis.

723
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,461
What?
What are we gonna do?

724
00:33:23,495 --> 00:33:26,697
We?
You could try having my back.

725
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:28,365
I just witnessed a murder.

726
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,434
You're not gonna get
a conviction,

727
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:32,169
and the DA just said
he doesn't care.

728
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:34,338
You know what, man?

729
00:33:34,372 --> 00:33:36,807
You haven't had
my back this entire case.

730
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:38,275
If you have a theory,

731
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:40,444
I'd run it into the ground
with you.

732
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:43,480
I might argue with you,
yeah, but I'd have your back.

733
00:33:43,514 --> 00:33:46,983
As a your partner,
you gotta let this thing go.

734
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:48,785
All we have to do is stay on her

735
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,453
and see if she's goes
for the cash.

736
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:53,156
You better hurry,
because she just left.

737
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:59,563
Where you going?

738
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:02,132
To stake out the pizza place.
Travis...

739
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,901
I don't care what she says,
Wes, all right?

740
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:06,303
I know Cooper sent that note.
And if I were him,

741
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,507
and I wanted to hide a message
in a pizza box, I would order it

742
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,343
from the nearest place
to where I'm hiding.

743
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:14,312
I'm betting anything the money
is still around there somewhere.

744
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:16,748
It's just a "feeling," but I'm
pretty sure I'm right about it.

745
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:18,516
All right, let's go.
No, no.

746
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:20,551
Do not do me
any favors.

747
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,268
How we doing
over here, Mike?

748
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:38,036
Any word
from your wife yet?

749
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:40,039
She'll be here. Traffic.
A few minutes, huh?

750
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:41,507
It's been over an hour,

751
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:43,675
and we're getting
pretty backed up.

752
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,179
Is there any chance I can
get you to wait at the bar?

753
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:48,848
I'll get you another order
of gnocchi on the house.

754
00:34:48,882 --> 00:34:50,917
Look, just give her
a few more minutes, huh?

755
00:34:50,951 --> 00:34:52,952
Just, just hold on. Oop!

756
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:56,789
Ah, here she is. Hey!

757
00:34:56,824 --> 00:35:00,694
Yeah, I figured
traffic. What?

758
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:01,928
Sure.

759
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:04,164
(phone rings)

760
00:35:06,568 --> 00:35:11,105
Hey, look, I got a bottle
of wine chilling here.

761
00:35:14,843 --> 00:35:16,611
Oh.

762
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:19,347
I'll see you
when you get home.

763
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,751
She, uh...

764
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:24,586
Caught in traffic.

765
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:28,156
Yeah.

766
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:30,492
Look, I'll take that
gnocchi to go, huh?

767
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:31,860
Of course.

768
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,861
♪ ♪

769
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:10,903
(door opens)

770
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:16,008
Is this a bad time?

771
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:19,778
That, that's not gonna end well.

772
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,280
Hands up.

773
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:23,282
You know the drill.

774
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:25,284
(door creaks)

775
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:27,753
Hands up. You know the drill.

776
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:40,131
One-hand cuffing, huh?
You police?

777
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:41,733
Prison guard.

778
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:44,535
I see.

779
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,171
Oh, I see, okay.

780
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,639
The author comes to prison

781
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,540
to interview the inmate
for her new book.

782
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,477
You get to know
the prison guard

783
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,245
who's there for all
the interviews.

784
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,547
The prisoner has a bunch of
money hidden somewhere,

785
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,082
and you two get to thinking,

786
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,151
"Hmm, maybe we could get
our hands on it."

787
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:04,321
Congrats.
You almost solved the crime.

788
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,691
I've been getting a lot
of that lately.

789
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,726
Dude, she used you
to help Cooper escape.

790
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:11,863
(laughs) She didn't use me.
It was my idea.

791
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,432
Oh, she let you think that,
too, huh?

792
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:17,836
Put him in the car.
We can't shoot him here.

793
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,370
Let's go.

794
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,181
All right, let me see
those hands.

795
00:37:29,215 --> 00:37:30,916
Get 'em up!

796
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:33,485
(grunts)

797
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:37,723
(tires squeal)

798
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,830
Get her! Get her!

799
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:47,234
(tires squeal)

800
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:04,419
(tires squeal)

801
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:21,938
(tires screech)

802
00:38:29,646 --> 00:38:31,814
(panting)

803
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,783
(indistinct radio communication)

804
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:40,690
Hey, guys, we found your money.
It's right here.

805
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:42,025
Yeah, no need
to thank us.

806
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:44,761
We're happy
to help out.

807
00:38:44,795 --> 00:38:46,463
I hate the FBI.

808
00:38:48,399 --> 00:38:50,099
Look, uh,
you were right.

809
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:52,635
You would have had
my back.

810
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,505
I'm just happy
that I was right.

811
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:56,973
About everything.

812
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:59,275
Well, let's not forget
about who got the money,

813
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,144
who saved your ass.
Yeah, you cut it

814
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:03,012
a little close though, didn't ya?
Well, I saw her

815
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:04,446
pull that gun on you,
I figured I'd give you

816
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:05,848
a little distraction.
Worked out nicely.

817
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:07,183
Yeah, but if you'd been
there a few minutes earlier,

818
00:39:07,217 --> 00:39:08,951
I might not have had
a gun on me at all.

819
00:39:08,986 --> 00:39:11,554
Well, my partner taught me that
being late's as good as being early.

820
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:13,189
Oh, that is absolutely not
what I said.

821
00:39:13,223 --> 00:39:15,057
That's not what you said?
That's not what I said.

822
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:16,959
I thought... What did you say?
No, what I said was that...

823
00:39:16,993 --> 00:39:18,394
See? You don't even know
what you said.

824
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:25,167
Hey, I have something
to say to you.

825
00:39:25,202 --> 00:39:27,203
Oh-oh.

826
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:31,507
You are a horrible
roommate.

827
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:35,877
and a terrible cook, but

828
00:39:35,912 --> 00:39:39,180
you really pushed
this case along

829
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:41,382
and you got
good instincts.

830
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:45,019
I'm gonna do what I can to
support that in the future.

831
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:47,154
No, you're not.
(chuckles)

832
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:56,329
Hey...

833
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:00,467
you know how you said

834
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:03,202
that my place is spotless
in therapy?

835
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:06,773
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry
about that. I was...

836
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:08,107
Wes...

837
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:14,279
my home is permanent.

838
00:40:14,314 --> 00:40:16,615
It's mine, man.

839
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:19,084
I know it can never
be taken away from me,

840
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,585
so I take care of it.

841
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:25,923
Growing up in foster homes...

842
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:28,726
I always knew it was
just a temporary stop

843
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:31,062
on my way to the next one.

844
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,965
And I guess I figured
that if I cared about it...

845
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,971
I'd get real messed up
when I had to leave.

846
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:43,708
Yeah, I get that.

847
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,845
All right.

848
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,320
Crap, you know what?
I forgot my keys.

849
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:56,514
I'll see you
down there, okay?

850
00:40:56,515 --> 00:40:58,784
All right, cool.

851
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:18,301
