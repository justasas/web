1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,960
You're here?

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,240
Yes.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,270
Ever since your younger grandson was found, 
you have been beaming.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,290
Leave aside the beam on my face
to keep beaming...

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,300
What is it that led you to be at the police station?

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,140
For someone who is a lawyer...

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,760
I am sorry.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,360
Will Bo Yeong let you back in now?

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,330
What kind of absurd misunderstanding was that?

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,270
I am sorry.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,050
Looks like you are kicked out from home.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,240
No, well...

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,900
Gyu Ho, let's go now.

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,790
Let me finish this. Just ten minutes.

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,850
When you leave, take some appetizers along.

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,110
Yes.

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,010
Grandpa. New Zealand...
What kind of country is it?

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,090
Why do you ask?

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,450
As we have a classmate sent from New Zealand,
our assignment is to learn of New Zealand.

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,920
New Zealand... is the country next to Australia.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,060
Beside Australia?

22
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,510
Where is Australia?

23
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,350
Beside New Zealand.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,740
Then New Zealand is?

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,790
Beside Australia.

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,640
Awesome.

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,160
What is it?

28
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,200
I asked where New Zealand is, and
Grandpa says it's beside Australia,

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,470
and Australia is beside New Zealand!

30
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,510
It's in the South Pacific. It's Oceania.

31
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,020
What about New Zealand, suddenly?

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,920
My assignment is to get to know New Zealand.

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,200
It's Grandfather that you asked about that?

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,710
It's a country famous for its sheep.

35
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,990
They primarily rely on stock-farming.
And they speak English.

36
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,260
Lord of the Rings was filmed
in New Zealand, right?

37
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,540
It's the southern hemisphere, so the
seasons are opposite to our country's.

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,170
If we have winter, it's summer there.

39
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,810
If we have summer, it's winter there.

40
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,670
That's right. That kind of country.

41
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,750
Why are you asking Grandpa on assignments?

42
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,640
Give it a rest!

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,780
Huh? Rest what?

44
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,440
Why did you ask him twice asking grandpa?

45
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,950
What is it that you know so much of?

46
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,470
Did I say that I know something?

47
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,370
Asking Grandfather about a distant country...

48
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,880
He could well ask me, right?

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,920
Then, should he ask a shitty female
trade school grad like you?

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,820
He keeps harping on it... really!

51
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,090
Why is my school a shitty female trade school?

52
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,470
Please leave it that.

53
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,610
Hold on a bit...

54
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,260
You are so ready to say that
my school and I are ignorant!

55
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,780
Father-n-law, what, you are
more cultured than me?

56
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,670
Better than you.

57
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,060
Better than me? Oh really?

58
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,330
The banking friends I meet are
all alumni of famous colleges.

59
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,850
They are all shocked seeing me.

60
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,990
Why shocked?

61
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,260
You jump out from behind to shock them?

62
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,440
You know a little about real estate and stocks,
so you think you know a lot more than me?

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,850
It is not just real estate and stocks, that 
I happen to know a lot more than you.

64
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,020
In the few things I am about to say now,
if you know of any one thing, pray tell.

65
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,440
Enviro-hormone. Sociopath. LA Dodgers.

66
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,570
You know any of that?

67
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,850
I know all of that--

68
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,750
I know all that. Why?

69
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,880
Then what is Enviro-hormon?

70
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,780
Are you now doing a test on me?

71
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,920
Obviously you don't know.

72
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,440
What don't I know?

73
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,090
I know but I don't care to tell. So what?

74
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,020
Those with true knowledge will not 
show off like you everywhere!

75
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,540
Even if they know, they'll only keep quiet.

76
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,060
If you did that, that will be nice!

77
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,090
Then, let me also ask you something.

78
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,750
Do you know what is a yellow bird song?

79
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,920
I'll tell you of intellect. Knowing a few 
buzz words is not what intellect is.

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,060
Historical classics...

81
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,330
I do know the Yellow bird song.
How would I not know?

82
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,090
What is it?

83
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,230
The yellow bird song by King Yu Ri, right?

84
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,920
Mirthfully fly the orioles, male-female pair to nest.
Lonely as I feel, whom do I go back to nest with?

85
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,820
Isn't that the one?

86
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,090
I finished it. Dad. Now we can go.

87
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,230
Okay.

88
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,510
Please leave it at that. We will leave now.

89
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,160
- Take care 
- See you again. See you again.

90
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,060
Good bye.

91
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,370
Hola, Jun Hyeok.

92
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,400
I have to greet you differently.

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,710
In future when I see you, I will be affectionate
with you. No objection, right?

94
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,750
We have no memories of us playing
together in childhood, right?

95
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,920
When you were 4 years and me 5 years,
you had disappeared, you know.

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,230
As for memories of you, at one time we had all 
the family gathered at seaside and had sashimi.

97
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,400
May be it was vinegar sauce? It fell in your eyes
and you cried loudly, as I vaguely remember.

98
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,060
That apart, I don't remember anything.

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,330
Let's enjoy it from here on.

100
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,230
If anybody bullies me, guard me well.

101
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,020
Isn't that the younger brother's duty?
Right?

102
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,470
Shouldn't we get Jun Hyeok
to go for his studies?

103
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,160
If he is to work in the company in future,
he needs to have an education isn't it?

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,200
About the DNA testing hospital. 
Why did we do it at such a small place?

105
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,330
Was it you who asked for it?

106
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:20,130
No but, rather than do that... 
with Min Hyeok in this state,

107
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,640
should we first have him learn managing?

108
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,680
Why weren't you putting some care into
where such an important test is done?

109
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,570
What?

110
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,510
Looking at Min Hyeok's condition, shouldn't we 
let him join, and formally have him manage,

111
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,780
for him to quickly learn the business?

112
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,440
Son-in-law Gim says there was a
case of mistakes in test results.

113
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,750
Studying... can be done on the side
as he work at the company, right?

114
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,400
Why aren't you hearing what I say
and just talking by yourself?

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,820
Look who's talking, aren't you not hearing me
and talking by yourself?

116
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,230
Fine. Why do I even bother to talk?

117
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,020
Good, then. Try not to talk.

118
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,330
<i>Ignoramus, really!</i>

119
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,230
How dare she disgrace people like that!

120
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,640
Your daughter-in-law is smart
and knows a lot too.

121
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,680
Knows a lot, my foot! Coming out of a 
shit-bucket female trade school, what can--

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,200
Whether a shit-bucket trade school grad,

123
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,090
or a piss-bucket trade school grad,
she knows quite a bit.

124
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,130
It's because you're ignorant, 
that you see it that way.

125
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,300
I should show her what a 
real intellectual can do.

126
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,200
What a real intellectuals can do?

127
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,230
What then? Write a Chinese poem
to show her that true ability?

128
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,610
Chinese poem?

129
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,920
But you don't have such ability, you know.
So just stay put.

130
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,950
Old brat. You think I am like you?
Ignorant fellow.

131
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,610
Look at this!... You open your mouth
and it's "ignorant fellow".

132
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,750
How the hell am I ignorant?

133
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,640
Aren't you ignorant, old brat?

134
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,160
You were No. 1 ranked from the back in school.

135
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,060
Shut up. You this...

136
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,990
It's because you're like this, that you 
have no friends. You know that?

137
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,020
What? My friends have all died.
That's why I have no friends.

138
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,160
Why wouldn't I have friends?

139
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,060
Yeah, you don't have! 
You say you had, you fart?

140
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,230
What?

141
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,750
A brat 3 years younger than me
but I still play with him... Rascal!

142
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,570
You call me older-brother
from now on, you old brat!

143
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,300
You are only older by 3, but if you keep this up,

144
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,950
I won't be friends with you anymore!

145
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,080
This... Forget it. Forget about it.

146
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,750
Forget it, fine... you old brat.

147
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,880
This damn shit...

148
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,460
Crap face.

149
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,090
Can't you wait just a little bit more?

150
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,370
I might be able to get a hold of it soon.

151
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,640
It's still a deposit of 50 million, right?

152
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,160
Still into wishful thinking, really?

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,060
What?

154
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,020
Are you going out somewhere?

155
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,780
Yeah.

156
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,920
Where?

157
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,570
It's just...

158
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,990
Taking young sir to the departmental store.

159
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,260
The aunt wanted some clothes
to be bought for him.

160
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,020
Yes.

161
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,440
Please get in. Aunt will be out real soon.

162
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,200
Okay.

163
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,090
So you are off to the departmental
store for clothes?

164
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,130
Now on you'll be like rich kids,
only in brand-name items!

165
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,880
No. I'm not.

166
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,020
There comes the "no" syndrome.

167
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,300
Right. When are you treating
me to the rib-eye steak?

168
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,440
What?

169
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,710
See this noble-fellow... 
Like you're hearing it the first time.

170
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,300
Somebody who will soon wear 
branded clothes worth millions

171
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,400
won't keep a promise to buy rib-eye steaks? 
You will keep it, right?

172
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,540
Yeah.

173
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:08,920
When?

174
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,680
Soon.

175
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,090
When is soon?
What month? What day? What time? What min?

176
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,710
Fine. Buy it whenever, for me.

177
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,160
You don't buy, you're dead.

178
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,160
You alma mater female trade school, ignorant...
(Supposedly in Chinese?)

179
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,230
You, You alma mater trade school female...
This does not rhyme.

180
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,160
If she even knows the Yellow bird song,
This is too obvious for her.

181
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,060
You brat, now you're even 
stealing my credit card.

182
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,950
That's why I ask why you took 
my card away?

183
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,470
Why do you stop studying 
just as you wish?

184
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,130
Didn't I say I'm now mulling over it?
Give me my bag. Now.

185
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,260
No way. Tomorrow I'm returning it.

186
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,300
Don't be like this. It's a limited edition. 
Mom, if you share it, won't that do?

187
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,060
No way.

188
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,200
Hey, really...

189
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,900
- Not giving it back?
- What is this?

190
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,200
- So you want this?
- Ah, yikes, ah, ah...

191
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,510
You brat, seriously!

192
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,510


193
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,400
Must you hit somebody's head?

194
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,440
So what if I hit? If you do 
what invites a hit, I will hit.

195
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,990
[Spanish] It's bad. Very bad. 
I hate you, and you're stupid.

196
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,570
What?

197
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,160
[Spanish] Why not? You are very bad and stupid.
And you don't go. Okay?

198
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,440
You swore at me, right? You brat.

199
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,640
Su Yeong.

200
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,540
What? What do you want to do,
learning Spanish?

201
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,570
I want to piss off your mom. 
To help you take revenge.

202
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,090
But when she can't even understand?

203
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,260
That's why she'll be more pissed off!
Didn't you just do that?

204
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,370
That's right. With those with crappy education,
what's most detestable is a foreign language.

205
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,540
[Spanish] <i>La Escuela...</i>
(The school)

206
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,230
Where is Jun Hyeok?

207
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,510
Washing his face. He will be coming soon.

208
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,400
The bag... In the end you returned it?

209
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,300
You thought I wouldn't?

210
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,990
Shouldn't the newspaper be left in the living room? 
Why did you take it into the bedroom?

211
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,880
Yeah. Why did you take it in? Why?

212
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,440
I'll bring it out later. Why are you adding 
to the confusion? You don't even read it.

213
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,330
I read it. Why wouldn't I?

214
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,370
[Spanish] La escuela pobre como caca.
(Your school is poor as shit!)

215
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,510
Huh?

216
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,260
What did you say?

217
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,400
Awesome!

218
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,330
You just spoke to me in Spanish?

219
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,470
What did you say?

220
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,610
I won't tell you.

221
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,130
How was that?

222
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,920
Jun Hyeok.

223
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,570
After having breakfast, go with me 
to the company.

224
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,470
Pardon?

225
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,990
This is a working day for me.

226
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,780
Isn't it good for you also to have a look
at how the company is?

227
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,680
Wear the suit we bought yesterday.

228
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
Why take him there already?

229
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,090
What, why not?

230
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,330
Hello.

231
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,470
Sure.

232
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,160
This is the new office building
since our merger this time.

233
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,020
Hello.

234
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,440
Toy companies are in general small in size.

235
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,850
But our toy company is seen as a large firm.

236
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,540
You have come over!

237
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,680
There are no problems, right?

238
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,230
Ah, yes.

239
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,440
<i>Why did you come to the company? If there's 
time, shouldn't you be finding the USB quickly?</i>

240
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,470
<i>It's not in the room.</i>

241
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,880
<i>Did you look through the clothes worn
when No Min Hyeok fell?</i>

242
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,920
<i>Yes. It wasn't there.</i>

243
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,330
<i>Did you check all the clothes
before they were laundered?</i>

244
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,990
<i>Yes.</i>

245
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,020
<i>Why isn't it there if you checked through?
I'm going insane, really!</i>

246
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,440
<i>Isn't it because you keep thinking it isn't there
that it's going like this?</i>

247
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,470
<i>Have a positive mindset that you will find it
and look for it again!</i>

248
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,990
Director O. You're not getting out?

249
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,260
<i>This is a life or death matter for me, damn it!</i>

250
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,780
Director O.

251
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,440
What's wrong?

252
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,950
Not getting out? It's the 7th floor.

253
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,230
Yes.

254
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,780
A bit... strange, don't you think so?

255
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,820
Stop saying that. How often do
test results turn out wrong?

256
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,710
I have to go to a get-together.

257
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,130
Why haven't you brought the newspaper out still?

258
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,640
Isn't it here?

259
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,820
[Spanish] La escuela pobre como caca.

260
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,230
Since earlier, what's this you have been saying?

261
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,880
Whatever it is, even if I explain it,
you just won't get it.

262
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,160
As you have no foreign language basics.

263
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,020
La escuela pobre como caca.

264
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,060
Excuse me please. I am sorry.

265
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,090
Excuse me please. Coming through.

266
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,020
How come you had to be here?

267
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,540
Just like that...

268
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,540


269
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,570
What's with this outfit?

270
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,640
You were always dressed like a bum 
and I had never quite noticed,

271
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,540
but now that you look like this...

272
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,820
Huh?

273
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,710
You look more like a bum!

274
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,610
Already learning management? 
Whoa...

275
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,510
It's not like that.

276
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,640
I came just for a look.

277
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,920
Hey, what are you doing? The director is waiting.

278
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,680
Yes.

279
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,200
Put that back up. Hurry!

280
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,750
Hey... What are you doing? Hey!

281
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,610
I am sorry.

282
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,370
<i>Could you please stop that?</i>

283
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,130
<i>What?</i>

284
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,160
<i>La escuela pobre como caca.</i>

285
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,970
Caca?

286
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,700
Shit?

287
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,470
I knew as much.

288
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,020
<i>La escuela pobre como caca.</i>

289
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,920
La escuela.

290
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,680
Shit-like school?

291
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,330
Shit-bucket girls' trade school?

292
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,990
I knew that would be it.

293
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,640
Fine. So this is how it will be?

294
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,060
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.

295
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,640
Seeing you come with me to the company...

296
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,300
I don't know how happy I am...

297
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,610
I had a cancer surgery a little while back.

298
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,640
This stuff... is good for the body, they said.

299
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,470
Now I've got to see you after 20 years, like this...

300
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,640
I should at least see your marriage and die...

301
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,570
Why am I like this suddenly?

302
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,130
They say anal hair grows if you cry while laughing.

303
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,300
It's if you laugh while you cry that it grows, I hear.

304
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,510
Anyway, studying is also the same,
with a lot to do up ahead.

305
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,540
For the moment, just do what you want to do,

306
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,060
and just live free and easy.

307
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,850
Yes.

308
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,640
Really, all these years, you must've had
things you wanted to do but couldn't.

309
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,680
What is it that you want to do the most?

310
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,310
What?

311
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,780
I have a friend whom I had given a lot of trouble.

312
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,920
Is that so?

313
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,440
And so?

314
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,470
So...

315
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,260
I wish to repay that friend.

316
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,400
Repay?

317
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,060
How so?

318
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,990
- Meat.
- Meat?

319
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,880
Yes. Meat.

320
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,160
May be buying some beef would be nice...

321
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,820
Buy it, buy it. Isn't it fine to just buy it?

322
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,090
You have no money, is it?

323
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,880
Shouldn't you have... just told me earlier?

324
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,680
For the moment, if you need to spend on it,
do it with this.

325
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,570
I'll return it to you right after
I buy the meat.

326
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,850
No need. You just keep it.

327
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,880
Shouldn't you be a bit careful?

328
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,020
I am sorry about that.

329
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,540
What a pity!

330
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,710
He gave you a credit card?

331
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,470
Yes.

332
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,990
That old scrooge?

333
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,640
Wow, he really loves his son or what?

334
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,200
A fellow who borrows 1000 Wons from a contract
worker and won't repay even at end-of-contract.

335
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,090
Is it okay to take and spend it?

336
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,610
Spend, spend.

337
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,260
He is such a miser, but you 
won't believe how rich he is.

338
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,920
If you take a scoop of water from 
the Pacific Ocean, is it noticeable?

339
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,880
Why is the TV always on with no one watching?
Switching it off.

340
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,820
What's your problem?
[Spanish] La escuela pobre como caca.

341
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,130
You love to say "shit-bucket 
girls' trade school", I see.

342
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,060
I have no foreign language basics and
can't understand it, you think?

343
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,090
Just surfing the internet for some 
self-study is enough to figure it out.

344
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,260
What? What did you say?

345
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,160
You didn't get what the basics-less me said?

346
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,200
[Spanish] Comportarse bien, por favor.

347
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,710
What was she just saying?

348
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,990
Better not to know. 
Knowing will only make you angry.

349
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,780
What is it? What? What was she saying?

350
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,230
Yes, CEO sir.

351
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,750
How have you been lately?

352
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,780
Seeing NarARa Superboard, and studying.
(Korean animation, circa 1992)

353
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,680
Right. Starting yesterday, I'm writing a diary.

354
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,950
Wow, really?

355
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,850
Is it fun to do?

356
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,750
It must be a diary to show the doctor?

357
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,260
Yes. Shall I read it for you?

358
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,920
Yes, I'm curious about how interesting it is.

359
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,780
November 11. Clear skies.

360
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,990
Ate a meal. What did I eat?

361
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,170
I had some soup.

362
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,780
After that, I watched NarARa Superboard.

363
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,440
How many episodes did I see?
I saw 3 of them.

364
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,330
Then the nurse nuna came over.
(Nuna - Elder girl or sister)

365
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,130
Which nuna was it? 
It was Pak Sueng Hui nuna who came in.

366
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,920
Have you had dinner?

367
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,440
No. Not yet.

368
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,090
Yes. It was very interesting.

369
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,750
Next time read more for me. You must, okay?

370
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,880
Okay.

371
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,400
Let's go out. 
I will buy you rib-eye steaks.

372
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,160
Really?

373
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,440
I am finally getting to eat rib-eye steaks?

374
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,570
What? Rib-eye steak?

375
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,470
Why rib-eye steak?

376
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,260
Ajumoni also come with us.

377
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,160
Okay if I come too?

378
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,440
What are you doing?

379
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,470
[Spanish] Compartarse bien, por favor.

380
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,610
Will you stop it, please?

381
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,130
I am also going to do some Spanish.

382
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,400
Though a shit-bucket girl's trade school grad
with no foreign language basics,

383
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,540
learning by myself is quite easy.

384
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,820
[Spannish] Compartarse bien, por favor.

385
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,090
Let's have a go at it, is that it?

386
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,370
You think I can't do it, as I'm 90 years old?

387
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,640
[Spanish] Compartarse bien, por favor.

388
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,060
Fine! You just watch!

389
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,230
I'll show you how far a shit-bucket girls' trade
school grad can hang with me on this.

390
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,260
Su Yeong. Get the Spanish book and come........

391
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,780
You'll get a headache this way. Enough, Grandpa.

392
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,440
What enough? When she's messing with me,
will I say enough?

393
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,570
You, don't try stop me.

394
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:04,680
-=You have ignorance. I'm educated=-
[Spanish] Tu tienes ignorancia. Soy educado.

395
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,850
Why are you messing with him?
Grandpa is crazily learning Spanish.

396
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,750
I'm sure he is. I'm not stopping, right?

397
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,330
-=I have no ignorance. I'm erudite.=-
[Spanish] No tengo ignorancia. Soy erudito.

398
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,990
Sorry that even Mom came along.

399
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,510
Did I bother you by coming along?

400
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,540
No, you didn't. I know how much 
food I have eaten from you.

401
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,060
Naturally I should invite you.

402
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,200
Welcome.

403
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,710
For you.

404
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,750
Just briefly... to the bathroom...

405
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,230
Oh... What?

406
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:50,200
I'm sorry, but other than the friend I earlier 
told you of, one more friend has come.

407
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,370
There is no way... but to get...
one more order of meat, I think.

408
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,880
So what about it?

409
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,920
Even if I get one more order, will it be okay?

410
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,820
Get it, get it.

411
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,710
Ah, yes. Thank you very much.

412
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,880
That kid. Maybe from how he grew up?

413
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,780
He takes it all seriously.

414
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,570
Then, should we order it?

415
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,470
Over here. Rib-eye steak, 3 orders.

416
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,990
Sure.

417
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,610
Not filling enough?

418
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,130
No. It's all right.

419
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,640
It's not quite that filling.

420
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,680
Meat ordered by headcount
is never filling enough.

421
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,330
I need a brief trip to the restroom.

422
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,060
Yeah, what?

423
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,950
It's that...

424
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,230
I'm sorry...

425
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,400
but I wondered if I could order 
a little bit more of meat.

426
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,060
Just get more. It's fine to get more, right?

427
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,610
We've had 3 orders. Another 3 more orders
will be needed, it seemed...

428
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,880
Oh, sure! Just order and have it.

429
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,780
Thank you very much!

430
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,850
So the meat is not filling, right?

431
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,370
Over here... please get us 3 more
orders of rib-eye steaks.

432
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,510
Sure, I've got it.

433
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,300
If we're ordering meat, shouldn't we order some
staple too? Cold noodles for me. What about you?

434
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,440
Not sure.

435
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,710
I need to... just briefly...

436
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,260
I'm not having it. We have 3 more orders meat
coming. How do we eat staples too? I won't.

437
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,260


438
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,400
Can't eat anymore?

439
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,160
And you youngster?

440
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,680
I am all right too.

441
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,820
Really?

442
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,470
Then I'll also have to eat just the meat.

443
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,710
- Weren't you going to the washroom? 
- No.

444
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,610
Really, you fed us so well!

445
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,130
It's nothing.

446
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,160
Look at the card, it's a gold card!

447
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,440
Whatever you say, rich people are different!

448
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,950
It's nothing.

449
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,990
So great to be out, after so long!

450
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,640
Even better that us 3 are together like this.

451
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,680
I am really feeling like having a drink!

452
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,570
There, again! What drunk act
do you want to do now?

453
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,850
It's not any liquor to drown sorrows.

454
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,880
At that kind of a place, in a happy mood,
and having a glass of wine--

455
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,160
Stop saying such useless stuff. Yeah right, wine...

456
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,200
As I'm sorry to keep calling you,
I'm texting you instead.

457
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,610
I'm really sorry, but my friends
want to have some wine.

458
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,510
Would it perhaps be fine to have the drinks?

459
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,060
PS. If we add appetizers, the estimate
is 100000 Wons, I think. (~US$ 85)

460
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,610
The kid! Come on...

461
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,130
May be from living a hard life?

462
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,020
He thinks small, eh?

463
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,300
Whom does he take after?

464
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,570
Drink, drink!

465
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,610
I can't even talk about that? Damn you...

466
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,260
Should we go and have some wine?

467
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,020
Really?

468
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,160
Yes.

469
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,440
Let's just go to that bar.

470
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,370
Wow. This is what they say is 
the might of the rich, really!

471
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,260
Aren't you supposed to be back home quickly?

472
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,540
No.

473
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,090
Grandfather?

474
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,230
He will be coming soon.

475
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,510
Suddenly, with all the Spanish study,
he's a bit out of it.

476
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,540
What's with this sudden fascination with Spanish?
Your mother too...

477
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,570
What else can it be? Those two are
in a battle of pride using that.

478
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,090
Over this while, you both learned a
new way of talking? Awesome!

479
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,020
[Spanish] blah blah... how dare... blah blah.
blah blah... I'm smarter... blah blah.

480
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,200
Isn't that enough? Is it some 3rd-rate
foreign film we're are watching here?

481
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,020
I seem to be a bit drunk. 
I should stop drinking now.

482
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,200
Yeah. You had one glass after another from
earlier on. It was no small sipping.

483
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,260
So much trouble. Taking a beggar 
mom and daughter to eat good food.

484
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,540
Thank you.

485
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,200
It's nothing.

486
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,470
Having let some fluids out,
I'm a little bit sober.

487
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,610
Drink some more, then.

488
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,750
Huh? Yeah.

489
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,400
Come on, let's go.

490
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,920
Wait a moment.

491
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,440
Youngster...

492
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,710
I have a favor to ask from you.

493
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,610
What is it?

494
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,020
Well... aren't you quite well off?

495
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,540
I'll repay you in a jiffy, but lend a 50 million--
(~US$ 45K)

496
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,680
What are you doing?

497
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,570
You...

498
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,470
Stop with that, really!

499
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,260
So scared, I can hardly talk...

500
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,570
My heart is... jumping, o haeyo....

501
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,850
If you... would know it--

502
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,370
Don't sing anymore.

503
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,260
What? Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo...

504
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,370
[Spanish] La escuela como caca.
comportarse bien, por favor.

505
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,540
That whole while, their gestures were great.

506
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,960
Live long enough, and one 
gets to see the wonder

507
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,850
of the wife and her 90 years old 
father-in-law fighting in Spanish.

508
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,640
[Spanish]

509
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,540
The credit card!

510
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,680
The card isn't there?

511
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,820
This is weird!

512
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,470
Earlier after having wine,
didn't you use it to pay the bill?

513
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,990
Yes.

514
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,640
Just now when you held mom, 
you must have dropped it!

515
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,920
I am all clear-headed after the wine buzz.

516
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,510
I'm really sorry.

517
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,020
What's there to be sorry?

518
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,060
Quickly report the loss and it'll be fine.

519
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,610
What did he say?

520
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,400
It is fine. He asked to report the loss now itself.

521
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,300
Where's ajumeoni?

522
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,570
I found it! I found it!

523
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,990
It got dropped at the shop front there.

524
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,820
You need to take this.

525
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,370
No need. He said it's already invalid,
so I will need to re-apply.

526
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,780
Really? Then, I'll keep it as a
memento of finding it.

527
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,570
Thank you for today.

528
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,610
Thanks to the rich family friend,
I had my first rib-eye steak.

529
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,880
Take care, go in.

530
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,780
Hey, Na Jin A.

531
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,570
Just tell me anytime in future.

532
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,330
Tell what?

533
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,990
Rib-eye steak. Just tell me if you want to eat it.

534
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,640
I'll treat you anytime.

535
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,990
Once more.

536
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,060
Just as expected.

537
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,090
Ajumma, you are not alone here.

538
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,260
Please wait a bit. Just one last time. 
Just once more.

539
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,990
I beg you, please work. I beg you.

540
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,020
Grandfather is still studying Spanish?

541
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,920
Yeah. Mom too.

542
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,330
What are these two up to, really?

543
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,370


544
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,920
<i>Grandpa and Mom are studying even harder
just to piss off each other.</i>

545
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,850
<i>Just like Columbus who headed for India 
but discovered the New World,</i>

546
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,160
<i>both unexpectedly discovered 
their own new interests in life.</i>

547
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,330


548
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:12,020
<i>Grandpa at 92 years old, discovered 
his dormant desire for knowledge.</i>

549
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,230
<i>Mom was attracted to
Spanish art and culture</i>

550
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:28,330
[Spanish] I am a boy. You are a girl.

551
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,510
I would like it if I can learn dancing.

552
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,020
What kind of dancing?

553
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,440
A dance that is suitable for this outfit.

554
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,330
Someone had sent me this from Spain. 
As it's really pretty...

555
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,610
Isn't it Lady Boss?

556
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,260
Hello.

557
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,020
How come you are here?

558
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,920
I'm a member here.

559
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,950
You should be telling me, why you would be here?

560
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:32,820
- The capital is Palma de Mallorca. The languages 
are Catalan, although we speak in Mallorquin, 
and Castellano, which is Spanish.
- I have a question. Is Don Quijote the best
Spanish novel?

561
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,230
Caramba! You fool!

562
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,810

563
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,950
The rumors on the CEO No are that

564
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,430
he dies, he's gone crazy, he had a 
sex change operation, etc.

565
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,800
I'm looking for a job.

566
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,580
Just work for my family. 
Won't that be enough?

567
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,340
How does one looking so 
perfectly all right be an idiot--

568
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,570
I have been so worried.

569
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,090
- I'll be sure to come back.
- What?

570
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,010
I wrote down all what you need to do. 
You should finish before noon.

571
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,080
Rest and do at the same time.

572
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,990
Support yourself with this and try to walk.

573
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,940
Left leg, left leg.

574
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,800
Perhaps the house is too big.
There are lots to do.

575
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,510
Hurry up bring the rag, ajumma.

576
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,410
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

577
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
-=Behave yourself right... Please=-
[Spanish] Comportarse bien, por favor.
