I think it's the first time that 2 such different contestants ended up in the finals.

8
00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:39,644
It's simply the matter of whether it being a vocalist? Or an artist?

Soo-jung has her distinct color.

She even received a 100 last time.

13
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,001
She's good.

14
00:00:55,711 --> 00:01:00,610
Ye-eun continues to write her songs and

15
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,272
I'm scared because she's really good.

16
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:09,847

Today we have left Lee Soo-jung and Ahn Ye-eun.

47
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:11,069
No one is able to predict who will be the winner of these 2.

48
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:15,900
Mr. Yang, representing the judges, how do you think today will go like?

49
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,306
Because today is a special day, Yang Hyun-suk came without a hat today!

50
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:25,340
This is personally my first time seeing his hair.

51
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:28,170
It's your own hair right?

52
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:33,610
Honestly before you mentioned that, when I first saw him,

53
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:36,170
I thought he had plastic surgery.

54
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,340
Doesn't his hair kind of look like GD's?

55
00:03:39,407 --> 00:03:39,847
It does.

56
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,137
It feels like you got it done at where GD gets his hair done.

57
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:44,306
It wasn't from GD's place, it was around his neighborhood.

58
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,968
Oh just around the neighborhood?

59
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,035
Alright no pun intended.

60
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,272
Mr. Yang. What do you predict?

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,745
Out of the 2 of them, whoever wins,

62
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,745
I don't think anyone will object but-

63
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:01,847
it's another topic of interest for us judges

64
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:04,711
to see which company the winner will choose.

65
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:08,847
Last year JYP took Bernard Park

66
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,678
and last year YG took Katie Kim.

67
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:15,711
It is my hope that this year's contestant

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,813
will consider going to Antenna.

69
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:23,644
That is my hope.

70
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:24,880
Mr. Yoo what do you think?

71
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:29,542
Unfortunately there has not been a winner that chose Antenna yet.

72
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,678
What do you predict?

73
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:31,934
I

74
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:34,204
can't really tell what the contestants are thinking.

75
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:37,340
And because this is a decision with their life dependent on it

76
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,069
rather than thinking about where you go,focus on today's performance.

77
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:45,272
I ask that you'll show us everything you have, like it's your concert.

78
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:47,678
You'll focus on the performances too right?

79
00:04:48,103 --> 00:04:49,103
Yes.

80
00:04:51,644 --> 00:04:55,678
Because as soon as the winner is announce, they are to choose a company.

81
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,644
The 3 judges can't help but to be nervous as well.

82
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:01,847
Mr. Park today's final round is a little different from the past rounds correct?

83
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:05,340
Yes the 2 contestants will be competing twice against one another.

84
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:10,509
The first competition will consist of songs that they each want to sing.

85
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:15,069
The second competition you can only see at Kpop star.

86
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:20,610
The contestant chooses a song that the opponent contestant sang in the past

87
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:23,711
and interprets in their own to way to sing. It's a round with a mission.

88
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:24,204
Yes.

89
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:26,103
Through these 2 competitions,

90
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:27,475
the winner will be decided.

91
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:35,373
Today's round will also be 60% of the judges' scores and 40% of viewers votes

92
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:38,340
and the total score will decide the winner today.

93
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,880
Then I will announce the order of performances today and their numbers!

94
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:44,103

I was thankful that they told me that but

140
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:26,934

[Where did they go?]

146
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:47,813
There's a place I used to perform and work at.

147
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:53,475
I was able to build up my experiences there so I wanted to go before the final round.

148
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:54,968
But it's really pretty.

149
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,745
The stage is really pretty.

150

151

[What is Ahn Ye-eun's new song that she's written for the final round?]

158
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:28,711
The title is not as unusual as the song titles before but

159
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:32,745
for some reason I think the song will be very unusual because the title isn't.

160
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:36,170
I wrote this song in 2012 so

161
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,509
I remember being really excited when I was writing this song.

162

00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:36,610
No matter how much I think about it and think back,

178
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:42,103
I don't know why you're mad.

179
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,542
I rewind, untangle, and piece them back together again,

180
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:53,204
Do you know what I did wrong?

181
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:57,001
Tell me.

182
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,644
Please. Just let me at least feel you breathe for just once.

183
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:16,306
Please untangle the knots that you have tightly roped around your heart.

184
00:12:16,306 --> 00:12:21,779
Please look at the once-beautiful memories.

185
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:27,373
What to do with my love that's been cut by the ends of your sharp stares?

186
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,711
What to do with my future?

187
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:33,509
What to do with the rest of my life?

188
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,204
No matter how much I think about it,

189
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:46,035
No matter how much I think about it,

190
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,847
No matter how much I think about it and think back,

191
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,644
I don't know why you're mad.

192
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,711
I untangle, rewind, and piece it back together.

193
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:08,170
Do you know what I did wrong?

194
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:10,373
Tell me.

195
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:20,779
She presents us with another unique and a dynamic stage today.

196
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,069
We'll hear from the judges.

197
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,069
I thought Park Jin-young's face lit up.

198
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:30,509
Can we hear from you?

199
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:41,441
I think the most common thing I've said about your stages is that it's a work of art.

200
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:43,900
Products? Or a work of art.

201
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:48,475
A product and a work of art can be similar in its idea but

202
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:51,035
they have a astronomical difference.

203
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:57,103
It's a work of art if it has within it the mind and the thoughts of the maker,

204
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:02,373
if it's just for the purpose and its looks it's a product. Like this pen.

205
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:08,170
When I look at all the songs you've written I can tell what kind of a person you are.

206
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:13,441
The song carries much of your past life, personality, and your daily life.

207
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,272
So I keep referring to them as works of art.

208
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:22,238
Today's song as well. It seems like you have always loved this way.

209
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:24,779
You give everything like a fool

210
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:28,340
and in front of the person you love you don't know how to manipulate them or lie.

211
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,711
You just love them.

212
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:33,407
And men took advantage of that in your past.

213
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:37,880
Because I feel like I can know the kind of person that you are,

214
00:14:38,137 --> 00:14:40,542
I can't help but to say that it's a work of art.

215
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:47,968
I think your music, and the person that you are is a work of art.

216
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,745
I wasn't too surprised by your music this time, just a little bit.

217
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:55,644
That's a minute detail I wish I could've seen.

218
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:58,900
I didn't know a day would come when you'd be able to go crazy like this on stage

219
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:01,968
this is all thanks to the love the people pour out to you.

220
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:03,509
JYP's score is-

221
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,880
He said that Ahn Ye-eun is a work of art herself.

222
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,813
Out of a 100, what is JYP's score?

223
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:10,272
92!

224
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:13,407
Mr. Yoo?

225
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,968
Not many people would've predicted that Ye-eun would have made it to the final round.

226
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:24,373
Especially because you didn't make the cut for episodes 1 through 10,

227
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:28,644
the viewers were not able to see you and you made you appearance at episode 11.

228
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:33,934
You are persistent in coming up with a variety of your songs that you write yourself.

229
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,103
I was surprised once again to see you bring your own song to the final round as well.

230
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,542
I was surprised by 2 aspects.

231
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:43,001
The first was

232
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:47,441
your vocal skills are getting better from the first time I heard you.

233
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:52,340
It feels like your vocal is becoming more developed.

234
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:53,779
Second.

235
00:15:54,934 --> 00:16:01,103
Up to this point, starting from Hong-yeon, probability of numbers, Mr. Mystery, etc.

236
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:05,103
There were a variety of songs but the song that you sang today, "Tell me,"

237
00:16:05,475 --> 00:16:10,678
I feel like what's musically unique about you is all inside of this one song.

238
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:11,745
So

239
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:14,475
apart from the fact that this song is special,

240
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:15,745
it's complete.

241
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:19,576
It feels a lot more lyrically organized.

242
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,272
this might be your signature song.

243
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:26,779
I have been waiting for a musician that could be rendered special.

244
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,204
I think that's you Ye-eun.

245
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:30,900
Okay. Antenna's score.

246
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:34,678
He praised that this was Ahn Ye-eun's signature song.

247
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:38,306
Antenna.. 97 points!

248
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,373
It's high!

249
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:40,779
It's high.

250
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,880
Mr. Yang.

251
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:51,340
This might be something that Park Jin-young said the most this season.

252
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,475
I think he compared products and work of art the most this season.

253
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:59,407
Usually artists, the drawing artists,

254
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:02,340
only draw one kind of work.

255
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:06,137
For example Korea's artist Paik Nam Jun made one work of art,

256
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,441
and a famous artist like Andy Warhol draws only one work of art.

257
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:13,137
That's why we call their creation a work of art.

258
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,509
I 100% agree that Ahn Ye-eun is a work of art because

259
00:17:17,509 --> 00:17:23,509
I honestly believe that it'll be difficult to find another artist like Ahn Ye-eun.

260
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:28,306
Since is this the final round I'll talk more about your strengths.

261
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:30,306
Your vocal style

262
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:36,238
is kind of like trot, something that even the older 50s and 60s audiences will enjoy.

263
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,306
But then her music has many characteristics of indie music.

264
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:45,847
And your lyrics are very hip, something that young generation will like.

265
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:50,678
You're a contestant that no one has ever seen or heard before.

266
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:52,934
So it's really difficult for me to give you a score.

267
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,644
YG's score is-

268
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:56,900
What score will she receive?

269
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,069
It was unclear whether it was a praise or a criticism-

270
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:02,407
95!

271
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,847
A total score of 284!

272
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:09,306
For the first round, she received the total score of 284 from the judges.

273
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:13,069
If you're rooting for Ahn Ye-eun, text the number 1

274
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:15,170
or Ahn Ye-eun to #0606.

275
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:17,542
Number 1 Ahn Ye-eun everyone!

276
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,475
[It's already been 6 months since the beginning of Kpop star]

277
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:27,779
It's already been 6 months.

278
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,103
Hello. My name is Lee Soo-jung.

279
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:34,441
When I first came here from Chicago,

280
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,103
I never thought I would make it this far.

281
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:44,610
I thought I would be eliminated on the first round.

282
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,204
But-

283
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,968
[Mazinger S and Lee Si-eun all left the dormitory]

284
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:59,509
Soo-jung are you crying?

285
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,238
Don't cry.

286
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:04,441
[Her friends that she's become close to continued to leave her]

287
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:05,441
Bye.

288
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:08,678
Friends left one by one and I

289
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:12,745
continued to say "Huh? Where's Joyce?"

290
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:18,306
or "Huh? Mazinger should be here soon" I kept doing that.

291
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:21,745
Now it's only 2 of us left

292
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:23,542
it feels really empty.

293
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:28,509
[Admist the pressures of being a TOP2, what song did Lee Soo-jung choose?]

294
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:37,847
[What is the meaning of this sigh?]

295
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:40,745
I can't imagine it.

296
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:44,407
How is she going to sing it? Does she know this song?

297
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,542
It's Korean pop, first of all.

298
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:49,340
Soo-jung is stubborn 'til the end.

299
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:52,069
I honestly thought she'd choose pop.

300
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:54,509
It's the Koreanest Korean pop.

301
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:56,610
Kim Kwang-jin's "Letter."

302
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:59,678
[Traditional Korean pop with the sentimental, Kim Kwang-jin's "Letter"]

303
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:05,880
To be honest I wanted to sing pop, which would be more comfortable for me.

304
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,711
[Why do you continue to choose Korean pop?]

305
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:10,711
But

306
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:17,001
I sang more Korean pop as I went on with Kpop star,

307
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:21,069
I will sing Korean pop on my last stage as well.

308
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:25,813
I think Soo-jung's R&B stands out more

309
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,644
when she sings slower songs rather than faster ones.

310
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:37,813
I came this far, I want to see how much more I can go.

311
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:41,069
I sing for myself.

312
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:46,779
I'm just going to try my best because this is my last stage.

I guess this is the end.

316
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:30,204
I will turn my back now.

317
00:21:32,745 --> 00:21:40,272
I won't try to go against fate by force

318
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:48,373
and bother you.

I will leave them all here.

I am honestly thankful

1 contestant continues to come out with her own songs

348
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:12,542
and you

349
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:15,968
are stubbornly holding onto Korean pop.

350
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:20,644
I know because I trained with you that you're not completely fluent in Korean.

351
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,238
So I thought you'd sing pop.

352
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,069
Because this is your most critical stage.

353
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:28,813
But after seeing you choose Korean pop even on this stage,

354
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:30,170
I was surprised.

355
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:39,373
This song is too particular to show your pop-like characteristic.

356
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:42,441
There were things like that at the end but

357
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:46,204
seeing you face your challenges directly

358
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:48,745
I am continuously surprised by that.

359
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:51,043
So later when you debut,

360
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:57,678
I think it's really important to push through with your style.

361
00:25:58,373 --> 00:25:59,373
Okay today-

362
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:02,711
I wish I could've seen more of your strengths.

363
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:06,407
But I combined every side of you that I've seen until now.

364
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:08,847
And I also took into consideration that it's the final round.

365
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,137
So the score. Antenna's score is-

366
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,968
What score would he have given? Antenna's score-

367
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:17,272
Out of a 100,

368
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,678
a score of 93.

369
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:22,509
Next.

370
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:23,678
Mr. Yang?

371
00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:29,644
I thought the same things as Yoo Hee-yeol.

372
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:32,137
Before Soo-jung sang

373
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,373
this song called "Letter,"

374
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:39,001
Park Jin-young told me "do you think she can sing this well?"

375
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:42,880
He was telling me that he was worried.

376
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,813
Because this is a song with such a different style.

377
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:53,934
So I was hoping she would change the song entirely to her style

378
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,306
I was expecting that when I was listening.

379
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:01,475
I was a little surprised that you didn't change it at all.

380
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,272
So on the positive note

381
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,542
you're trying something new

382
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:07,170
you kept to the originals.

383
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,576
But I wish you could've taken advantage of this opportunity

384
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,170
had she changed it to your style entirely and sang it that way,

385
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:18,678
I think it might have been much better to listen to.

386
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,934
YG's stage, YG's score is-

387
00:27:21,968 --> 00:27:24,407
We'll see YG's stage later.

388
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:25,340
The score is

389
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,711
92!

390
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:28,934
Nice.

391
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:31,137
He pointed out some points of improvement. Mr. Park?

392
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,170
I, too,

393
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:36,238
agree with what Hyun-suk said.

394
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:38,779
But actually,

395
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:40,272
you can't

396
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,035
really change this song very much.

397
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:46,103
So

398
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:50,407
until now you've showed a couple of times that you were able to

399
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:53,272
embody other genres that we didn't think you could pull off.

400
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,779
Perhaps your challenge to yourself this time may have been a little too audacious.

401
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:59,847
I think this song might have been a little difficult to do that. But-

402
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,340
I want to praise you for continuing to step out of your comfort zone.

403
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,137
But I do want to point out,

404
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,509
your vocals have developed a lot.

405
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:13,170
You can't even compare where you are now and where you began.

406
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:15,610
I am very proud of you in that aspect.

407
00:28:15,678 --> 00:28:16,900
JYP's score is-

408
00:28:17,035 --> 00:28:20,745
He complimented her in vocal improvement. JYP's score?

409
00:28:21,272 --> 00:28:22,204
92!

410
00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:24,340
A total score of 277.

411
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:26,678
If you're rooting for Lee Soo-jung,

412
00:28:26,678 --> 00:28:31,340
please text the number 2 or Lee Soo-jung to #0606.

413
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:34,069
Number 2 Lee Soo-jung everyone!

414
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:41,711
Thank you for the 2 contestants' stages.

415
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:46,069
We'll look forward to the 2nd round of mission competition soon as well.

416
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,847
As of right now

417
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,711
Ahn Ye-eun is on the lead by not very much.

418
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:53,711
Now it is our time to invite the special stages.

419
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:58,509
Kpop star season 3's semi-finalist.

420
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:04,340
Sam Kim, who was named the guitar genius and was very loved by many is coming.

421
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:07,678
After preparing for the last 2 years at Antenna,

422
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,137
he will be debuting right here and now.

423
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,509
Mr. Yoo. You were with him every step of the way.

424
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:17,272
Tell us what kind of a stage and a song this is. Right now.

425
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:18,272
Yes.

426
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,103
The following stage is of a song that Sam Kim wrote himself.

427
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:26,542
He wrote and rearranged all of the songs on his album.

428
00:29:27,204 --> 00:29:31,880
One particular person is helping him out with this song.

429
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:35,678
Crush, who is very popular these days, is featuring the song.

430
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:37,466
It's called "Let's leave it."

431
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:44,035
We'll see after seeing the performance whether the song is good or not.

432
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:49,306
The most beloved Sam Kim has now returned as a singer.

433
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:52,272
Let us invite him on stage.

434
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:54,441
Kpop star!

435
00:29:58,475 --> 00:29:59,475
Hello.

436
00:30:00,137 --> 00:30:05,001
I'm 15, 15. My name is Sam Kim and I am from Seattle, Washington.

437
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:06,103
Thank you.

438
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:12,204
I think this was meant to be.

439
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,900
Let's go to the ends with me.

440
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,170
[Sam Kim is now a family of Antenna, his first stage begins now]

441
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,847
[Let's leave it - Sam Kim]

442
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,745
You told me to tell you first.

443
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:09,475
You told me to tell you right away when I'm mad.

444
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,204
I don't understand.

445
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:20,900
What are you thinking.

446
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:30,306
I have lots to think about right now here and there.

447
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:34,407
I'm clueless.

448
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:37,001
I'm clueless.

449
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:41,576
I don't know if I'm being unbelievable

450
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:43,441
I'm clueless.

451
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,035
I'm clueless.

452
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,880
I'm a fool for liking you, you're a fool for already knowing. It's all complicated.

453
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,475
How many more times should I say that you're pretty?

454
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:12,509
I'm getting weary because of you.

455
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:13,711
Why are you getting mad?

456
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:14,711
Don't lie.

457
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,745
Enough is enough.

458
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:25,610
What are you thinking?

459
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,813
I have lots to think about right now here and there.

460
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,407
Don't you get tired?

461
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:39,001
I'm clueless.

462
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:41,644
I'm clueless.

463
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:46,170
I don't know if I'm being unbelievable

464
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:48,204
I'm clueless.

465
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,678
I'm clueless.

466
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,847
I'm a fool for liking you, you're a fool for already knowing. It's all complicated.

467
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:58,542
Everything is complicated, the same, you're right.

468
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,880
At times even talking all night on the phone won't even do.

469
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,170
The aversive strategy is becoming banal for a reason perhaps.

470
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:05,441
You're not the only one at fault.

471
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:08,407
I'll be better to you definitely.

472
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:12,170
I don't ever intend to leave you and go.

473
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:18,779
How great would it be if you were honest with me?

474
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:23,644
Then don't show that you're mad at least.

475
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,968
You're more important than anyone else.

476
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:29,509
You hurt me more than anyone else.

477
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,968
You know why.

478
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,441
I'm clueless.

479
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:36,813
I'm clueless.

480
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,204
I don't know if I'm being unbelievable

481
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,644
I'm clueless.

482
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:46,035
I'm clueless.

483
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,576
I'm a fool for liking you, you're a fool for already knowing. It's all complicated.

484
00:33:51,644 --> 00:33:52,644
I'm clueless.

485
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,069
I'm clueless.

486
00:33:58,035 --> 00:33:59,610
I don't know if I'm being unbelievable

487
00:34:00,711 --> 00:34:01,934
I'm clueless.

488
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,407
I'm clueless.

489
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:10,137
I'm a fool for liking you, you're a fool for already knowing. It's all complicated.

490
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:20,441
Kpop star stage stayed the some but Sam Kim returned a changed man.

491
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:22,678
He became a man and a celebrity.

492
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:25,137
Thank you for the great performance.

493
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:28,847
Now, as Mr. Park said, it is the mission round.

494
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:33,847
The two contestants are in trouble. The contestants find this round most difficult.

495
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,306
We'll continue the second round with "Sing the other contestant's song".

496
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,170
Because the 2 contestants are very unique in their styles

497
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,137
I can't imagine them having to sing each other's songs.

498
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:48,137
We'll see what they have for us.

499
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:51,934
We'll invite number 1 Ahn Ye-eun first.

500
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:53,880
Number 1 Ahn Ye-eun everyone!

501
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:00,103
[The staff asked to meet the two somewhere]

502
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:03,035
[What's going on?]

503
00:35:06,441 --> 00:35:08,576
[An envelop enclosed with a mission is handed to them!]

504
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:12,441
Please open the envelop at the same time and read what's written inside of it.

505
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,441
[What mission surprised the two so much?]

506
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:20,238
The final round mission is

507
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:23,779
to sing each other's song.

508
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,170
I had no idea what to do.

509
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:30,880
I was shocked.

510
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,745
I think I would've cried.

511
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:36,576
I would've asked why I had to do this when we're at the end.

512
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,103
I would've broke down.

513
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:42,306
Anyone can tell the two of them have such a different music style,

514
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,170
they also have different singing styles.

515
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,137
I'm worried about that but at the same time

516
00:35:47,137 --> 00:35:49,711
I'm looking forward to it.

517
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:54,610
How many songs are on there that you think you might be able to do?

518
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:55,934
There is none.

519
00:35:56,204 --> 00:35:57,204
None?

520
00:35:58,204 --> 00:36:01,576
Either they're ballads I have never heard before

521
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:02,813
or a R&B.

522
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:03,847
All of them.

523
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:07,069
I didn't even know where to begin.

[Ye-eun is listening to the songs that Soo-jung's sung]

525
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:16,968
[Getting more difficult as she listens]

526
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:23,576
I don't have as stable and an excellent of a vocal.

527
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:27,711
One song I thought maybe I could rearrange

528
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:30,035
was this song.

529
00:36:31,204 --> 00:36:33,678
[What song did she end up choosing?]

530
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,880
[Looking hard]

531
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:43,509
This is literally a mission for Ye-eun.

532
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,306
Stevie Wonder's Part time lover.

533
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:52,170
[The song Soo-jung sang with Yoo Jay during the casting audition "Part time lover"]

534
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:56,475
She was really praised for that performance.

535
00:36:57,035 --> 00:37:03,340
I was worried I would continue to be reminded of that performance as I was singing.

536
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,475
I sing the first verse in English.

537
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:12,035
I tried to change the lyrics to Korean that goes along with the lyrics.

538
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:18,001
I rearranged the song the best I could to change the song to my style.

539
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,711
This is a challenge, a very big challenge.

540
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:21,779
But who knows?

541
00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:25,441
If she overcame that and owned this song as entirely hers,

542
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:28,170
I think I'll be completely surprised.

543

The cafe at the end of the cross street,

546
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:14,001
the second table near the window.

547
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:18,170
I'll be waiting for you wearing a white dress.

548
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:21,340
You look to her

549
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,678
your hands onto my waist.

550
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:25,475
Under the moon,

551
00:39:48,204 --> 00:39:52,170
As if dancing a graceful dance, without any sound,

552
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:58,441
I walk the night, carefully.

553
00:39:58,441 --> 00:40:02,509
Beyond the eyes where the sun rises,

554
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:08,509
we prepare tomorrow's secrets.

555
00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:26,934
If I wink my eye, you have to pass me like you don't know me.

556
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:31,880
If I cough twice you can see me again tomorrow.

557
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:47,934
You and me.

558
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:50,001
Without anyone knowing.

559
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:03,069
She played the keyboard so passionately her hair is messy.

560
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:06,711
Thank you Ye-eun for singing for us.

561
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:09,779
What did you guys think about "Part-Time Lover"? Mr. Park?

562
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Because Ye-eun is an agent in her music rearrangements,

563
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:25,847
we took particular attention to how you rearranged the song.

564
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:32,900
People typically say, like this song I just came out with, "you're still alive."

565
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:39,745
I thought about what it would mean to be alive.

566
00:41:39,813 --> 00:41:42,204
You're alive if something goes within you

567
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:45,238
and is changed by the time it comes out.

568
00:41:46,035 --> 00:41:49,847
Whatever the song may be, to Ye-eun

569
00:41:49,934 --> 00:41:52,035
it goes inside of her

570
00:41:52,204 --> 00:41:53,407
and when it comes out,

571
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,103
it comes out changed, dipped in your particular color.

572
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:02,610
I think she showed us all the technical of music she could.

573
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,968
Even in reharmonization, she went from high chord progression to low.

574
00:42:06,968 --> 00:42:09,441
She went from minor to major.

575
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:12,779
Beats from double time to single time.

576
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:18,137
You were really into this music and had fun while doing it.

577
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,170
Really-

578
00:42:19,813 --> 00:42:23,678
I think you showed all of your strengths on this stage.

579
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:24,847
JYP's score is-

580
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,900
Nice.

581
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:29,137
JYP's score.

582
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:30,542
98!

583
00:42:31,475 --> 00:42:33,610
Very close to a 100.

584
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:34,847
It's a high score.

585
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:37,170
Okay. Mr. Yoo?

586
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:45,711
There are usually typical attributes to an audition program like this.

587
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:53,475
I have never seen a musician like Ye-eun make it all the way to the finals.

588
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:59,610
And I have never seen someone not get nervous and continue to keep their style.

589
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:01,306
Ye-eun,

590
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,509
to be honest,

591
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:04,441
really.

592
00:43:04,441 --> 00:43:10,644
You have this unique characteristic that some people might not like.

593
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:13,137
But your one important charm is

594
00:43:13,475 --> 00:43:16,813
that you know how to provoke a person.

595
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:20,373
And you're not using any shallow strategy,

596
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:23,644
I'm glad that you're using music to do that.

597
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:26,934
You're a very interesting contestant.

598
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,968
Should I say a problematic contestant?

599
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:31,306
Antenna's score is-

600
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:34,137
The problematic contestant Ahn Ye-eun.

601
00:43:34,576 --> 00:43:35,968
What would Antenna's score be?

602
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:37,001
98!

603
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,441
She's scoring very high.

604
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,475
What will Mr. Yang Hyun-Suk say?

605
00:43:45,475 --> 00:43:48,340
I don't think I'm giving good feedback today.

606
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:51,711
I don't like the way I'm doing it.

607
00:43:52,272 --> 00:43:53,509
I think it's because-

608
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:55,238
Is this your first time feeling that way?

609
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:58,204
I think it's because I

610
00:43:58,441 --> 00:44:01,306
took off my hat one during season 1

611
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,069
and I'm without my hat for the first time in 5 years.

612
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:06,880
I'm very embarrassed I feel very unfamiliar.

613
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:10,137
It's great it reminds me of your Suh Tae-ji and kids days.

614
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,238
It's like going back to your old days.

615
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:14,475
But this is how powerful music can be.

616
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:17,340
I was looking at the previous stage with Sam Kim,

617
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:20,035
I was asking myself why I hadn't recruited him.

618
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:25,001
His stage was that much excited to even make me regret

619
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:26,813
and then Ye-eun came out

620
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:29,103
and put together such a perfect show,

621
00:44:29,475 --> 00:44:32,238
I think I can do better with my feedback now.

622
00:44:33,373 --> 00:44:35,813
The score that I just gave you

623
00:44:35,813 --> 00:44:38,934
is a score that I give to Sam Kim and Ahn Ye-eun.

624
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:40,272
Okay. YG's score is-

625
00:44:40,576 --> 00:44:42,542
What could he mean?

626
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:44,542
A score given to Sam Kim and Ahn Ye-eun.

627
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:46,306
100!

628
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:48,880
A total score of 296!

629
00:44:49,644 --> 00:44:51,968
Yang Hyun-Suk gave her a score of 100.

630
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,137
If you're supporting Ahn Ye-eun,

631
00:44:55,272 --> 00:44:59,900
text number 1 or Ahn Ye-eun to #0606

632
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:02,576

[She just looks at the song lists without saying anything]

639
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,103
Can you read the songs that's written?

640
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:44,745
Almost all of them are written by her.

641
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:49,306
[Except one song, all of them are Ye-eun's songs]

642
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,934
To be honest I was a little mad.

643
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:59,847
Because all Ye-eun's songs are written by her.

644
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,272
The songs are great the way they are,

645
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:04,475
I didn't want to touch them.

646
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,576
[Which song did Soo-Jung choose out of Ye-eun's songs?]

647
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:14,880
I feel like it's going to be this one song.

648
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:21,711
I thought she was going to sing Mr. Mystery.

649
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:25,610
[What did Soo-Jung choose instead of the popular Mr. Mystery?]

650
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,238
This was unexpected.

651
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,644
The song I'm going to sing is

652
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:34,813
Stick-er by Ye-eun.

653
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:41,934
[stick-er portrays the obsession of a stalker]

654
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:48,035
This song is the symbol of Ye-eun's dark purple color.

655
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:53,847
How will Soo-Jung change this to her classy gold, black, silver?

656
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:56,813
Soo-Jung can act a little bit when she sings.

657
00:46:57,035 --> 00:46:59,779
Maybe a different stalker?

658
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,137
She might be able to portray a sexier vibe I think.

659
00:47:06,238 --> 00:47:11,711
I can't play the piano or play any other instruments so

660
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:14,272
honestly I only have my voice.

661
00:47:14,441 --> 00:47:19,340

Everything ended.

00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:30,069

675
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:40,238
I followed your voice, your scent

676
00:48:40,373 --> 00:48:43,745
and your footsteps.

677
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,745
I slowly recalled the traces yet to be burned.

678
00:48:50,779 --> 00:48:52,847
Are you happy?

679
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:56,035
I'm not.

680
00:48:57,069 --> 00:49:00,306
I put my hands

681
00:49:00,475 --> 00:49:03,900
on a cold wall.

682

00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,069
Yoo Hee-yeol had a face that I could not read.

700
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:42,204
Yang Hyun-Suk had a wide smile on his face.

701
00:50:42,678 --> 00:50:45,779
She was behind by 7 points in judges' scores from the first round.

702
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,610
Will she be able to make up the points?

703
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:48,644
Mr. Park.

704
00:50:49,475 --> 00:50:50,475
Before

705
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:54,441
when you were singing "letter."

706
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,968
I felt like I was going crazy because I felt like I couldn't breathe.

707
00:50:58,813 --> 00:51:01,373
Is this how this is going to end?

708
00:51:01,441 --> 00:51:02,441
Here?

709
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,934
You showed it all on your second song.

710
00:51:05,934 --> 00:51:10,847
You perfectly show what kind of a person you are, what kind of a singer you are.

711
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:13,610
I mean, this contestant

712
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:17,238
was the same one who couldn't hit the high notes during the first round.

713
00:51:17,272 --> 00:51:22,069
She didn't know how to sing the high notes so she used her high notes.

714
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:24,441
How could this happen?

715
00:51:24,934 --> 00:51:26,779
She challenged herself with K-pop songs but

716
00:51:26,813 --> 00:51:30,373
she also discovered how to sing the high notes during this program.

717
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:33,711
She's an amazing contestant. And as I always say,

718
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:37,272
she always does things that I cannot predict.

719
00:51:37,475 --> 00:51:38,711
Earlier-

720
00:51:38,711 --> 00:51:43,509
when she sang there was a part when she dropped to major 7.

721
00:51:43,509 --> 00:51:47,610
Those things. People usually don't go to that note.

722
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,340
There are definite reasons to cut down on points when giving a score

723
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:55,968
JYP's score is-

724
00:51:57,678 --> 00:51:59,373
She is unpredictable.

725
00:52:00,373 --> 00:52:01,340
JYP!

726
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,847
A 100!

727
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,306
It is his second 100!

728
00:52:05,137 --> 00:52:08,407
Personally for Lee Soo-Jung it's her 2nd 100 as well.

729
00:52:09,238 --> 00:52:11,475
It is the 2nd 100 of the day as well.

730
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:12,847
Okay.

731
00:52:13,576 --> 00:52:14,745
Mr. Yang?

732
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:17,711
It looks like right now

733
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:22,069
I feel like I'm watching a movie with a twist or something.

734
00:52:22,813 --> 00:52:24,847
This is the last song.

735
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:29,069
To be honest, before she sang this song

736
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:35,001
I thought Ahn Ye-eun might win.

737
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:36,880
But Soo-Jung

738
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:39,847
when she encounters a song that suits her,

739
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:42,001
she hits a home run.

740
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:50,103
On the other hand, Ahn Ye-eun showed us a very unique stage with her own songs.

741
00:52:52,745 --> 00:52:56,340
The score that I'm giving you may seem like it's low.

742
00:52:56,711 --> 00:52:57,711
YG's score is-

743
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:59,745
It may be low.

744
00:53:00,035 --> 00:53:01,542
YG's score?

745
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,576
A movie with a twist.

746
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,373
A 100!

747
00:53:05,847 --> 00:53:07,204
2nd 100!

748
00:53:07,373 --> 00:53:09,272
Today's 3rd 100.

749
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:12,475
Lee Soo-jung's 3rd 100.

750
00:53:12,968 --> 00:53:14,576
She currently has a score of 200.

751
00:53:15,137 --> 00:53:16,137
Mr. Yoo?

752
00:53:17,272 --> 00:53:18,813
Unbelievable.

753
00:53:22,272 --> 00:53:26,035
You sang Kim Kwang-jin's "Letter" earlier.

754
00:53:26,509 --> 00:53:28,509
The first lyric of that song

755
00:53:29,069 --> 00:53:31,407
says "I guess this is the end."

756
00:53:31,644 --> 00:53:33,441
That's how the song starts.

757
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:37,475
I was wondering why you chose a song with those lyrics.

758
00:53:37,745 --> 00:53:39,509
Is she saying goodbye?

759
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:42,306
Why did she choose that song?

760
00:53:42,745 --> 00:53:45,934
But the last lyric of this song

761
00:53:46,407 --> 00:53:52,170
it's like, almost like a femme fatale in a movie,

762
00:53:52,745 --> 00:53:58,069
she portrayed a twist saying "I'm going to find you."

763
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:01,934
I have goosebumps all over my body right now.

764
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:06,441
Ye-eun may have written the song

765
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:10,001
but I think Lee Soo-Jung owns the song.

766
00:54:11,137 --> 00:54:12,407
Antenna's score is-

767
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:15,542
Would this not be the end?

768
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:17,542
No way. Antenna.

769
00:54:17,576 --> 00:54:18,711
A 100!

770
00:54:18,711 --> 00:54:21,170
300. A perfect score!

771
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:22,779
Thank you.

772
00:54:22,779 --> 00:54:27,880
There has never been a judges' score of 300, a perfect score.

773
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:31,441
This is unprecedented in the history of Kpop star.

774
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,204
Viewers. If you are rooting for Lee Soo-Jung,

775
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,441
please text number 2 or Lee Soo-Jung to #0606.

776
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:42,678
Number 2 Lee Soo-Jung everyone!

777
00:54:47,509 --> 00:54:50,373
Final round of Kpop star's season 5!

778
00:54:50,475 --> 00:54:52,204
Is it Ahn Ye-eun? Or Lee Soo-Jung?

779
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,306
Is it Lee Soo-Jung? Or Ahn Ye-eun?

780
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:55,968
Who are you rooting for?

781
00:54:56,035 --> 00:54:56,934
Ahn Ye-eun!

782
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:57,934
Who?

783
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,170
They are really close.

784
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,678
They have a difference of 3 points.

785
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:04,900
We are waiting for your votes everyone.

786
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:09,170
Please vote for the contestant you are rooting for.

787
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,204
In just a moment

788
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:12,813
the winner will be announced.

789
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:17,238
Viewers and every fan around the globe.

790
00:55:17,238 --> 00:55:20,137
This one stage is coming to you.

791
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:25,373
Park Jin-young's comeback stage is being prepared.

792
00:55:25,441 --> 00:55:27,779
The title is "Still alive."

793
00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:31,678
Mr. Yoo. What do you think this stage is going to look like?

794
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,880
To be honest, I

795
00:55:33,745 --> 00:55:38,340
To be honest, I watched the music video of this song beforehand.

796
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:41,238
I was very surprised by the lyrics.

797
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:44,509
It sounds like he wrote his own autobiography.

798
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,576
I thought at first "Could he do that? How can he be so shameless?"

799
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,610
but of course he's forever a music-lover.

800
00:55:53,137 --> 00:55:55,813
After I heard it I thought that JYP has returned.

801
00:55:56,306 --> 00:55:58,644
I was really glad and I

802
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:01,373
want to cheer him on as a friend.

803
00:56:03,035 --> 00:56:07,170
JYP's first comeback stage in the world.

804
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:11,576
The best singer who's been giving us happiness for years.

805
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,035
Everyone let's invite him up on stage.

806
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,441
Park Jin-young!

807
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:45,306
["Still alive" - Park Jin-young]

808
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:51,069
Everyone stand up!

809
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:59,542
Singer who dances is how old?

810
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:02,644
40 and 4 more. He's still at his peak.

811
00:57:02,678 --> 00:57:05,509
He's different from the stars that are newly popular.

812
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:08,745
Those of you who come and go. Watch.

813
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:12,103
I don't act like I'm cute, I'm not pretentious.

814
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,340
I don't say that my lover is all of you.

815
00:57:15,373 --> 00:57:18,238
I play like the party-animal I am.

816
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:21,576
Even after that I'm still alive.

817
00:57:22,035 --> 00:57:24,509
Records became cassettes.

818
00:57:25,204 --> 00:57:28,103
Cassettes turned into CDs.

819
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,103
Even after CDs became streaming downloads.

820
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:34,272
Even in the 90s, 2000, and in 2010,

821
00:57:34,272 --> 00:57:35,340
I'm still alive.

822
00:57:37,238 --> 00:57:38,441
I'm still alive.

823
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:41,745
I'm still alive.

824
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:47,204
Even in the 90s, 2000, and in 2010.

825
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,001
Everyone gather around. You know who I am right?

826
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:53,069
I'm different from the boy groups that you like.

827
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:56,373
I debuted before those boy groups were born,

828
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:59,441
but I get awards in front of those boys.

829
00:57:59,745 --> 00:58:04,137
I'm sorry. I hope your boys survive as long as I did.

830
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:09,001
But that's not as easy as it sounds so I'm a little worried.

831
00:58:09,001 --> 00:58:12,137
If you study me the probability goes up.

832
00:58:12,542 --> 00:58:15,103
Records turned into cassettes.

833
00:58:15,745 --> 00:58:18,475
Cassettes changed to CDs.

834
00:58:18,847 --> 00:58:21,576
Even when CDs' become streaming, and downloads

835
00:58:21,576 --> 00:58:24,779
even in the 90s, 2000, and in 2010,

836
00:58:24,813 --> 00:58:26,001
I'm still alive.

837
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:29,441
I'm still alive.

838
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:32,373
I'm still alive.

839
00:58:34,238 --> 00:58:37,475
Even in the 90s, 2000, and in 2010.

840
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:40,745
It's not the survival of the fittest.

841
00:58:40,847 --> 00:58:44,001
The ones who survive are the fittest.

842
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:47,069
It's not the survival of the fittest.

843
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,170
The ones who survive are the fittest.

844
00:58:50,272 --> 00:58:53,001
You call someone a singer after 10 years.

845
00:58:53,576 --> 00:58:56,272
You call someone a star after 20 years.

846
00:58:56,678 --> 00:58:59,542
You call someone a legend after 30 years.

847
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:02,847
So just like that I am still hungry.

848
00:59:03,069 --> 00:59:05,745
Records turned into cassettes.

849
00:59:06,204 --> 00:59:09,069
Cassettes changed to CDs.

850
00:59:09,373 --> 00:59:12,069
Even when CDs become download, and streaming,

851
00:59:12,103 --> 00:59:15,306
even in the 90s, 2000, and in 2010,

852
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:16,711
I'm still alive.

853
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:19,847
I'm still alive.

854
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:23,069
I'm still alive.

855
00:59:24,678 --> 00:59:28,035
Even in the 90s, 2000, and in 2010.

856
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:31,035
You call someone a singer after 10 years.

857
00:59:31,475 --> 00:59:34,069
You call someone a star after 20 years.

858
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:37,407
You call someone a legend after 30 years.

859
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,610
So just like that I am still hungry.

860
00:59:42,272 --> 00:59:43,475
Still alive.

861
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,813
JYP does not disappoint.

862
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,035
You find yourself going with the rhythm.

863
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:59,880
I think this place turned into JYP's concert for a moment instead of Kpop star.

864
00:59:59,934 --> 01:00:02,103
What did the 2 judges think?

865
01:00:02,137 --> 01:00:03,610
They're really big deals.

866
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,610
Mr. Yang?

867
01:00:04,711 --> 01:00:05,968
What did you think?

868
01:00:08,644 --> 01:00:11,306
Park Jin-young is 3 years younger than me.

869
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:16,407
The fact that he can sing and dance on stage

870
01:00:16,678 --> 01:00:21,137
I think is incredible especially seeing it in person today.

871
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:25,441
Park Jin-young performed a comeback stage last year too

872
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:27,204
and that song became number 1 in the charts.

873
01:00:27,204 --> 01:00:28,035
It did.

874
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:31,407
I think he might be drawing attention to himself once again today.

875
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:32,509
On the final round.

876

Presenting his new song.

877
01:00:34,745 --> 01:00:38,475
I think Park Jin-young's stage is great, needless to say.

878
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:43,170
We have with us today last year's winner Katie Kim.

879
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,711
Our iKon is here as well.

880
01:00:46,441 --> 01:00:51,441
And Kwon Jin-ah, Jung Seung-hwan, and Lee Jin-ah are here as well.

881
01:00:52,035 --> 01:00:55,847
I wanted to introduce that they were here to the viewers.

882
01:00:56,509 --> 01:00:57,576
So I thought I'd mention them.

883
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,934
More important than giving feedback on JYP's stage,

884
01:00:59,934 --> 01:01:03,880
is to introduce his company's artists.

885
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,340
What did you think Yoo Hee-yeol?

886
01:01:05,711 --> 01:01:10,678
I was glad to see that for the first time JYP's choreography was something I could do.

887
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:11,880
I'm very glad.

888
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,238
From what I understand you can't even dance that.

889
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:16,137
Alright.

890
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:17,678
It was a great performance.

891
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:20,509
I think he might take over the music charts once again.

892
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:24,644
Now the time has come for us to finalize our Kpop star season 5 journey.

893
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:28,475
Before we announce the winner and her choice of company,

894
01:01:28,509 --> 01:01:33,542
we have prepared a special stage to celebrate our last stage of Kpop star.

895
01:01:33,678 --> 01:01:37,204
Kpop star's participants and this person will come to stage.

896
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,644

898
01:01:41,204 --> 01:01:43,441
Let us see the special stage.

01:01:43,441 --> 01:01:44,779
We'll invite them up now!

This season's contestants'

process of overcoming their fears and their pain

902
01:01:57,272 --> 01:02:02,103
it gave us courage just by observing them.

903
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,238
I read once online that someone wrote

904
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:16,678
I don't know if Si-eun will read this or not but I was very encouraged by her song.

905
01:02:17,069 --> 01:02:18,272
When I read that I

906
01:02:19,745 --> 01:02:22,779
was very touched and almost cried.

907
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:32,644
Our family told us that thanks to you guys our last 6 months have been so fun.

908
01:02:33,934 --> 01:02:37,069
All our hard-work was worth it.

909
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:41,306
There are people out there who were happy and had fun because of us.

910
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:44,238
That made me really happy.

911
01:02:45,407 --> 01:02:48,610
My name is Joo Mi-yeon, 25 years old, from Kwang-Joo.

912
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:52,170
I was very scared of stages.

913
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:54,441
I was scared and shook with fear.

914
01:02:54,542 --> 01:03:03,306
I realized that I could be loved when people encouraged me.

915
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:05,204
So I was very encouraged.

916
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:10,880
One of them overcame stage fright,

917
01:03:11,035 --> 01:03:15,711
another overcame language, the language-barrier.

918
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:20,272
Still another had no idea how to express emotions but they began to here.

919
01:03:20,779 --> 01:03:22,475
Seeing all of that

920
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:26,509

921
01:03:26,745 --> 01:03:29,779

01:16:46,441 --> 01:16:50,968
Soo-Jung please tell us how you feel.

1051
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:52,610
Did you think you'd win?

1052
01:16:52,745 --> 01:16:53,745
Yes.

1053
01:16:54,272 --> 01:16:55,103
You predicted it?

1054
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,137
How do you feel right now?

1055
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,847
I feel great.

1056
01:17:00,968 --> 01:17:02,306
And

1057
01:17:02,542 --> 01:17:04,847
I'm really thankful.

1058
01:17:05,509 --> 01:17:07,542
Writers, producers,

1059
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:10,340
and the judges.

1060
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,644
Thank you guys.

1061
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:17,407
I'm happy that I met many good friends from Kpop.

1062
01:17:17,407 --> 01:17:19,407
I will work hard.

1063
01:17:20,934 --> 01:17:21,934
Alright.

1064
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,238
Ahn Ye-eun won 2nd place.

1065
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:26,306
Ye-eun please tell us how you feel.

1066
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:27,847
You were very close.

1067
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,900
You won second place but that's still amazing.

1068
01:17:31,779 --> 01:17:32,610
Thank you.

1069
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:37,576
I'm honored to just be standing here.

1070
01:17:38,035 --> 01:17:40,373
I'm really thankful to the judges.

1071
01:17:40,373 --> 01:17:45,069
It was great that I was able to let you guys hear my songs.

1072
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:49,475
Thank you those of you who cheered me on. Thank you.

1073
01:17:49,745 --> 01:17:52,644
I'm thankful that I got to meet good friends.

1074
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:56,779
I'm really really thankful that Soo-Jung sang my song so amazingly.

1075
01:17:57,441 --> 01:18:00,103
This was such a valuable experience.

1076
01:18:00,103 --> 01:18:01,103
Thank you.

1077
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:03,610
Everyone this is not the end.

1078
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:07,137
The winner has been decided between the two.

1079
01:18:07,272 --> 01:18:09,306
It is now time to decide who will win from those 3.

1080
01:18:09,373 --> 01:18:12,137
The winner Lee Soo-Jung.

1081
01:18:12,306 --> 01:18:18,779
Which company out of JYP, YG, and Antenna did she choose?

1082
01:18:18,934 --> 01:18:23,069
We'll reveal Lee Soo-jung's choice right this moment.

1083
01:18:26,441 --> 01:18:28,509
I said some harsh things relatively.

1084
01:18:29,576 --> 01:18:31,441
[Being flooded with regrets]

1085
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:33,900
I intend to make it up to them.

1086
01:18:34,475 --> 01:18:39,610
I think it'll be better for me to point out the negatives of the other companies.

1087
01:18:39,934 --> 01:18:43,137
It's obvious that Antenna is a very good company.

1088
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:46,441
They just don't have much experience in producing.

1089
01:18:47,272 --> 01:18:49,238
And for JYP,

1090
01:18:49,678 --> 01:18:53,103
he has a new song coming out again, so he's very busy himself.

1091
01:18:53,745 --> 01:18:56,407
YG has many employees

1092
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,678
one might be able to debut a little faster.

1093
01:19:00,103 --> 01:19:01,644
I have one expectation.

1094
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:04,137
The 3 weeks of training we had.

1095
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,813
Would she have forgotten that?

1096
01:19:07,373 --> 01:19:09,373
We don't know how to make a star.

1097
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:14,407
But we're a company who knows how to do music for a long time.

1098
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:18,035
If you'd like to have the musician career for your life,

1099
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:20,407
please choose Antenna.

1100
01:19:21,001 --> 01:19:23,035
[Which company will the final winner choose?]

1101
01:19:24,272 --> 01:19:27,711
[Winner's final choice]

1102
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,238
Now it is time for Soo-Jung to choose the company she'd like to go to.

1103
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:34,137
Starting from Park Jin-young please give a short shpiel.

1104
01:19:35,306 --> 01:19:36,306
I-

1105
01:19:37,035 --> 01:19:38,880
won't say anything else.

1106
01:19:40,103 --> 01:19:45,001
I will write you a really good song that you can lose your mind and sing.

1107
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,610
If you come to my company, -You'll write her a song!

1108
01:19:48,373 --> 01:19:51,407
I think that's the best thing I could tell you.

1109
01:19:51,813 --> 01:19:53,204
You said you'd make it short.

1110
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:54,610
Mr. Yang?

1111
01:19:54,644 --> 01:19:56,035
Make it short and sweet please.

1112
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,678
I did not predict this

1113
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:00,847
so I am nervous.

1114
01:20:01,204 --> 01:20:03,272
Are you saying that you didn't know she'd win?

1115
01:20:03,272 --> 01:20:05,204
No. That's not what I mean.

1116
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,847
Before we came up here we talked about who Soo-Jung will choose

1117
01:20:11,035 --> 01:20:14,968
all of us said that we had no idea.

1118
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:18,779
I'm already nervous that I might be the one chosen.

1119
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:19,509
Alright.

1120
01:20:19,509 --> 01:20:20,509
Mr. Yoo?

1121
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:21,745
Short and sweet please.

1122
01:20:21,813 --> 01:20:23,170
I'll make it short.

1123
01:20:23,509 --> 01:20:27,509
I'm going to find you.

1124
01:20:29,103 --> 01:20:31,813
Will that work against him? Or will it work?

1125
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:35,745
Soo-Jung. I heard that you kept changing your mind in terms of the company you want.

1126
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:37,103
Have you made up your mind?

1127
01:20:37,103 --> 01:20:37,745
Yes.

1128
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:39,847
What was your criteria for choosing this company?

1129
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:44,968
The company I chose is

1130
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:46,306
Yes.

1131
01:20:46,306 --> 01:20:47,407
Okay.

1132
01:20:47,407 --> 01:20:49,532
She's not perfectly fluent in Korean. That's okay.

1133
01:20:49,557 --> 01:20:55,035
We'll hear from the final winner which company she has chosen!

1134
01:20:55,137 --> 01:20:57,103
Yang Hyun-suk's YG?

1135
01:20:57,103 --> 01:20:59,900
Or Park Jin-young's JYP?

1136
01:20:59,968 --> 01:21:01,711
Yoo Hee-yeol's Antenna?

1137
01:21:01,813 --> 01:21:05,880
Who does the final winner Lee Soo-Jung choose?

1138
01:21:06,934 --> 01:21:08,001
Which one is it?

1139
01:21:08,306 --> 01:21:10,272
She changed her mind a couple of times.

1140
01:21:10,272 --> 01:21:12,204
The three of them are hopeful.

1141
01:21:12,272 --> 01:21:13,272
Your choice is?

1142
01:21:14,711 --> 01:21:15,968
It's Antenna.

1143
01:21:15,968 --> 01:21:18,678
Antenna Music!

1144
01:21:18,711 --> 01:21:19,711
It's Yoo Hee-yeol!

1145
01:21:19,711 --> 01:21:21,813
Please come out! Yoo Hee-yeol!

1146
01:21:23,407 --> 01:21:24,576
Congratulations.

1147
01:21:24,576 --> 01:21:27,069
Lee Soo-Jung chose Antenna music.

1148
01:21:27,103 --> 01:21:28,170
Come out please.

1149
01:21:30,103 --> 01:21:31,103
Alright.

1150
01:21:31,745 --> 01:21:34,103
The judges are sharing the joy.

1151
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:36,238
Two of you come out too please.

1152
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:39,407
Antenna music's Yoo Hee-yeol.

1153
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:43,407
Great.

1154
01:21:43,407 --> 01:21:46,880
Soo-Jung. Can you tell us why you chose Antenna music?

1155
01:21:47,137 --> 01:21:49,441
I worked with him.

1156
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:50,813
It was really nice.

1157
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,779
I would like to work next to a genius.

1158
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:56,441
Because he's a genius.

1159
01:21:56,576 --> 01:21:59,610
Please tell us how you feel Mr. Yoo.

1160
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:03,170
It's my first time.

1161
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:05,644
In my participation with Kpop star.

1162
01:22:06,745 --> 01:22:10,813
From now on, with a heart of a father, like a parent,

1163
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:13,968
I'll be responsible for her for the rest of my life.

1164
01:22:13,968 --> 01:22:16,035
Please sing us the song you were singing earlier.

1165
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:17,745
Can you be quiet?

1166
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:20,001
I see.

1167
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:21,509
I think it'll be a good home for her.

1168
01:22:21,509 --> 01:22:27,137
Soo-Jung will now find a new home at Antenna music now and develop into a singer.

1169
01:22:27,137 --> 01:22:28,475
Please cheer her on.

1170
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:32,441
We'll end Kpop star season 5 here.

1171
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:37,509
Thank you for everyone who followed us along to the birth of a new Kpop star.

1172
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:40,968
Thank you everyone who's watched us thus far.

1173
01:22:41,137 --> 01:22:42,968
We'll come back soon.

1174
01:22:42,968 --> 01:22:45,238
Goodbye everyone! Thank you!
