1
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,190
I'm scared of having a hard time

2
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:51,524
proving the superiority
of Western civilization

3
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:56,101
to an Afghan villager
watching TV with me.

4
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:10,973
I'm scared of being invited one day,

5
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,176
at the last minute, by friends of friends,

6
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:18,153
to dine on long, plump, white worms

7
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:20,451
wriggling on the plate.

8
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,959
Or grilled flying grasshoppers.

9
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:30,433
Or snake roasted in its gravy.

10
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:08,438
The pain wakes me up.

11
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,637
It's almost time for my medication.

12
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:17,483
Daylight.

13
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,085
Another day.

14
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:25,713
It looks cold out there.

15
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:28,416
Cold and cloudy.

16
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,354
When I was young,

17
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:35,797
it seemed like it was always cold.

18
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:40,834
We lived up north, in the country.

19
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:45,635
Nobody around for miles.

20
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,614
I was always on my own,

21
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:54,116
so I had to find ways
of entertaining myself.

22
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:57,384
I'd go exploring in the woods,

23
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:02,654
looking for interesting plants
and animals.

24
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,458
And insects.

25
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:13,834
I had a real fascination for insects.

26
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,834
Huh?

27
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:02,017
Mom didn't like me
bringing home specimens.

28
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:06,352
She thought they were dirty
and disgusting.

29
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,015
Eric, is that you?

30
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:09,593
Dinner's almost ready.

31
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:13,220
Okay, Mom. I'll be right there.

32
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,928
Even though she hated
my bug collection and other stuff,

33
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:20,698
Mom encouraged my interest
in science

34
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:24,502
and allowed me to set up a workspace
in my room.

35
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,440
My lab.

36
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,414
For me, it was a sanctuary.

37
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,608
I spent hours there,

38
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:34,218
working on experiments,

39
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:37,584
examining my specimens.

40
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:53,634
Eric, come down here!

41
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:55,535
Come on!

42
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,107
Coming, Mom!

43
00:11:58,277 --> 00:12:01,940
I don't know why,
but I hid the jar under the bed.

44
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,843
Eric!

45
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,517
I guess I didn't want Mom finding it.

46
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:12,283
After dinner, I rushed up to my room.

47
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:16,484
But it was gone.

48
00:12:18,564 --> 00:12:21,556
I searched all over
for my little specimen.

49
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:26,264
Finally, I gave up.

50
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:29,465
It took me a long time to settle down.

51
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:35,137
Over the years,

52
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:38,181
I'd periodically heard the same sound,

53
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:41,650
like something moving, scratching

54
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:44,984
deep within my bed.

55
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:49,625
That bed.

56
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:52,355
I took it to college with me.

57
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:57,535
I found a small apartment for myself
near the campus.

58
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:01,398
I didn't want any roommates.

59
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,872
They'd be too distracting.

60
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:11,882
All I wanted was a nice,
quiet place to study.

61
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:19,124
To be honest,
after all those years in isolation,

62
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,691
I found it hard to socialize,

63
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,590
especially with girls.

64
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:25,993
Oh, no! Look at that loser!

65
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:29,191
Hey, buddy! What's your problem?

66
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:31,131
Why don't you take a picture?

67
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:32,634
It'll last longer!

68
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:38,569
They were so beautiful and alluring.

69
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,410
But impossible to make contact with.

70
00:13:47,686 --> 00:13:49,483
Excuse me.

71
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:52,582
That's why I was so surprised

72
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,692
when Laura stepped into my life.

73
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,259
I didn't mean to bother you.

74
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:59,023
Aren't you
in Schermann's Biology class?

75
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,629
Yeah, I...

76
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:03,962
Yeah, I noticed you,

77
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:07,367
always so serious,
with your nose in your books,

78
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,668
taking thousands of notes.

79
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:14,108
I missed the last lecture.
Can I borrow your notes?

80
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:19,115
Sure, I... I have them right here.

81
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,718
Thanks, that's so cool!

82
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:24,219
I won't need them long.
Oh, my name's Laura.

83
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,156
Uh...

84
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:31,722
Eric. My name is Eric.

85
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,688
Thanks again, Eric.

86
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:35,595
Bye now!

87
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,708
Hi, Laura, this is Eric.

88
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:48,972
No. Not too fast.

89
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,372
Laura?

90
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:54,110
This is Eric. From Biology class.

91
00:15:03,062 --> 00:15:05,087
What am I doing?

92
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:12,301
- Hello
- Laura? This is Eric.

93
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:15,304
- From Biology class.
- Hi, Eric!

94
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:19,433
Your notes are great.
You need them back already

95
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,646
Actually, I...

96
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:25,841
I was calling to ask
if you want to see a movie or...

97
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:28,578
A movie Okay, cool.

98
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:30,221
Really?

99
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:31,822
Are you sure?

100
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:35,188
Sure, I'm sure. What time's the movie

101
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:45,102
You understand now, don't you

102
00:15:45,271 --> 00:15:46,966
Understand what

103
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:49,300
That you're mine. You're all mine.

104
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,100
Oh, Jack! Yes!

105
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,006
- Yes!
- Yeah, that's right.

106
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:55,511
You belong to me completely.

107
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:59,276
Jack! What are you doing

108
00:15:59,952 --> 00:16:01,214
Don't fight it.

109
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:02,979
Don't fight it, I said.

110
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:06,420
I didn't pay much attention to the movie.

111
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:10,818
I was content

112
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,466
just to be sitting next to Laura.

113
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,035
- No!
- Yes!

114
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,839
I loved that!
It was so sweet and romantic!

115
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:28,746
Real life should be like that.

116
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:30,472
Let's stop for a drink.

117
00:16:34,954 --> 00:16:37,923
Mmm, so good!

118
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,820
Vodka gives me shivers all over.

119
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:45,930
I had shivers just looking at her.

120
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,532
And when she leaned over
and kissed me,

121
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,896
I just about died.

122
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:55,302
I'm ready for another. How about you?

123
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,271
Yes, sure.

124
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:02,309
I wasn't used to bars or drinking.

125
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,609
But I didn't want Laura to think
I was a square.

126
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:09,015
There, I like it when you smile!

127
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:12,624
You've got cute little dimples.

128
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,820
I felt I was being swept along
in a dream

129
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:18,759
I had no control over.

130
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:22,230
It was a dream
I wanted to last forever and ever.

131
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,501
Wow.

132
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,201
Nice and cozy.

133
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:34,971
Let's see.

134
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:37,513
When she asked
to go back to my place...

135
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,275
What's in here?

136
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:42,284
I heard myself saying yes.

137
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:49,251
What a cute little bed!

138
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:54,031
A little cowboy bed!

139
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,429
Wanna play cowboys and Indians?

140
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:03,766
I know it's stupid,

141
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,571
but I couldn't afford a new one.

142
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:09,771
I never said it was stupid.
I'm just teasing!

143
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:14,248
You are so serious! Come over here.

144
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,082
Let's see you get serious with me.

145
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,921
Playing hard to get?

146
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:24,995
Maybe you need
a little encouragement.

147
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,123
Laura?

148
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:03,330
Laura, wake up! Laura?

149
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:05,766
You're hurt!

150
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,304
You've cut your arm!

151
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:10,965
Good morning.

152
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:13,407
Don't I get a wake-up kiss?

153
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,837
I'll be right back. I'll get you a bandage.

154
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:19,006
Don't worry, you'll be okay.

155
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:24,149
The wound looked so deep and awful.

156
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:28,282
I didn't understand
how she could be so calm.

157
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,018
I'll be very careful.

158
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:34,359
If it hurts or if I wrap it too tight,

159
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,467
just tell me, okay?

160
00:19:39,204 --> 00:19:40,933
There.

161
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,598
That should hold you for now.

162
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:47,735
If you get dressed,
I can take you to the hospital.

163
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,341
I don't need a doctor.

164
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:52,006
I need you.

165
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:56,614
A little kiss will make everything better.

166
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,450
Come here.

167
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:01,252
I won't bite.

168
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,157
See?

169
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,803
That wasn't so bad, was it?

170
00:20:13,705 --> 00:20:15,002
Right.

171
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:17,608
If you're sure about the doctor,

172
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:19,641
maybe we should go to class.

173
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:24,879
It's so cozy right here with you.

174
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:29,210
I don't feel like going anywhere.

175
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:36,956
It took me a long time
to get to class that day.

176
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:42,023
By the time I got home that night,

177
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:46,128
I was completely exhausted.

178
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,351
Hi there!

179
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:02,817
I was hoping you'd show up soon.
Dinner's ready.

180
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:07,152
I figured after studying all day,
you'd like some home cooking.

181
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:08,816
Um...

182
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,861
That...

183
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,621
That looks great.

184
00:21:15,968 --> 00:21:18,835
She was acting kind of weird,

185
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:23,100
but did I want to do anything about it

186
00:21:24,476 --> 00:21:25,966
No.

187
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,444
I finally had a girlfriend.

188
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:33,414
A beautiful, sexy girl

189
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:37,248
who seemed to actually like me.

190
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,049
For a while, it was nice.

191
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:45,094
Really nice.

192
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,562
But as the days went by,

193
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:50,668
there was a shift.

194
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,395
I really need to finish this chapter.

195
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:57,133
I have a Biology exam tomorrow.

196
00:21:58,544 --> 00:22:01,104
What? What did I say?

197
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,077
I just want to know one thing.

198
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:05,546
What's more important to you?

199
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:08,481
Me or all your stupid little books?

200
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:12,915
Things just got worse.

201
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,491
Worse and worse.

202
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:18,425
She stopped attending classes.

203
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:23,432
She seemed to have
no friends or interests except me.

204
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:26,704
She only ever left
the apartment for groceries.

205
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,605
Food.

206
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:32,676
It seemed her primary focus in life

207
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:36,610
was cooking rich, heavy food for me.

208
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,512
She was also changing physically.

209
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,918
You're mine!

210
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:48,116
She was stronger.

211
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:49,317
You're all mine!

212
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,462
More muscular.

213
00:22:52,064 --> 00:22:54,555
You're my little bitch, aren't you?

214
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:58,236
You're mine forever.

215
00:22:58,403 --> 00:22:59,927
Yes!

216
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,833
You're mine!

217
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:17,421
One day,

218
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:18,988
when I came home

219
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:22,388
and found she'd cut off
all her long, beautiful hair,

220
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:24,252
Laura?

221
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,365
I knew the end was near.

222
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,593
Here, I made you a nice drink.

223
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:35,266
Thanks, but I'm not really thirsty.

224
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,465
I made it just for you.

225
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:40,669
Come over here and drink it. Now!

226
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:44,839
You don't need to get sore.

227
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:29,827
Ahh.

228
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:32,987
Finally decide to wake up?

229
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,892
Calm down.

230
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,195
Don't worry.

231
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:42,029
This will only take a second.

232
00:25:11,503 --> 00:25:14,404
What's taking them so long

233
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,874
The pain is getting worse.

234
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:20,636
And the heat.

235
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:23,645
It's always too hot in here.

236
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:28,349
I just want my medicine.

237
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:33,084
I just want

238
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,750
to go back to sleep.

239
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,266
I know it can't be like before.

240
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,595
All that's over.

241
00:25:48,273 --> 00:25:50,741
Gone forever.

242
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:58,038
I just wish she still liked me.

243
00:25:58,884 --> 00:26:03,548
Or at least pretended to.

244
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:39,947
I'm scared of dying under torture,

245
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,292
from cancer,

246
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,327
in a road accident.

247
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:48,796
What's the right way I'm not sure.

248
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,369
While making love

249
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:54,437
I'll need to put out an ad,
because recently...

250
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,703
If it's good, I'll want more.

251
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,002
If it's dull, it's no way to go.

252
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:00,508
No, I refuse, period.

253
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,647
Death. What an outrage!

254
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:06,250
I don't want to show deference.
Or go with a bang.

255
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:09,683
For there to be, after all that, so little.

256
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:12,380
Nothing, nothing without nothing.

257
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:15,685
I can't. I refuse.

258
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:25,062
I'm scared of
being totally unaware politically.

259
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:29,173
Maybe I'm deluding myself.
Maybe I'm right-wing Or even worse

260
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,332
Recently,
I'm never short of a good argument

261
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:34,535
not to take sides, not to get involved.

262
00:27:34,713 --> 00:27:36,772
But I am increasingly

263
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:40,884
susceptible
to conservative arguments.

264
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:44,146
Don't rock the boat.
Young people lack respect.

265
00:27:44,322 --> 00:27:48,088
Make the most of what you've earned.

266
00:27:49,594 --> 00:27:52,028
I'm moving center-left.

267
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:25,885
I'm scared of mediocrity.

268
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:29,390
I'd prefer to be bad than mediocre.

269
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,257
Going unnoticed is the worst fate.

270
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,523
But I refuse to be pure.

271
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:36,860
Pure is a threat to us.

272
00:29:37,035 --> 00:29:41,335
An unscrupulous messiah will come
to wash us whiter than white.

273
00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:44,964
Right down to our vices,
down to the bone.

274
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,678
Don't poke your nose
into the big cleanup.

275
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:47,793
We welcome a new student today.

276
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,828
Introduce yourself.

277
00:31:51,302 --> 00:31:54,237
Ayakawa Sumako.
I will try to be a good student.

278
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,667
Where do you live?

279
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,774
The old house near the waterfall.

280
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:00,570
The old house behind the cemetery?

281
00:32:00,745 --> 00:32:02,508
I live there with my mother.

282
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,944
We used to live in London,
where my father...

283
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:08,608
Hajime, Hajime
Where are you, Hajime

284
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:09,810
Here comes a stranger...

285
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:11,319
Children!

286
00:32:11,923 --> 00:32:13,857
Wait till you meet Hajime!

287
00:32:14,025 --> 00:32:16,016
Be quiet!

288
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,024
Who is samurai Hajime?

289
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:20,528
It's an old legend, Sumako-san.

290
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:23,166
Samurai Hajime died
over 100 years ago.

291
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:24,926
He's buried in our cemetery.

292
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:27,469
You'll meet him.
He chops up strangers!

293
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,097
That's enough!
Sumako, you can sit down now.

294
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:37,474
Michio, if you're so smart,
can you tell me

295
00:32:37,649 --> 00:32:39,139
why Hajime was executed?

296
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:41,717
- Uh...
- No, you don't know. Knucklehead.

297
00:32:41,886 --> 00:32:43,513
None of you know?

298
00:32:43,955 --> 00:32:47,413
We'll make it today's lesson.
Turn to Page 100.

299
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:51,892
Sumako, can you read the text
next to the illustration?

300
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,230
"Samurai Hajime of the Satsuma clan

301
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,732
was sentenced to seppuku,
ritual suicide,

302
00:32:57,902 --> 00:32:59,665
after he chopped up a British officer

303
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,668
on the Tokaido road in the year 1865,

304
00:33:04,842 --> 00:33:06,070
in the Edo period."

305
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,816
We were waiting for you.

306
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:25,956
We are the descendants
of samurai Hajime.

307
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,859
You remember?

308
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,569
You're really pathetic.

309
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:35,171
Yeah? Really?

310
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,532
You dare laugh at us?

311
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,507
You should be careful, Sumako.

312
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:52,249
This is how we treat newcomers here.

313
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:53,481
Stop! Mercy!

314
00:33:53,658 --> 00:33:56,889
Come on, sweeties, tickle her all over.

315
00:34:09,073 --> 00:34:12,133
Now, now, that's no good,
Sumako-chan.

316
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,541
You mustn't wake up like that,
halfway through.

317
00:34:15,713 --> 00:34:19,274
You have to see your dream through
to the end.

318
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:23,647
You must sleep, Sumako-chan.

319
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:28,155
Sleep.

320
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:03,373
Is anyone there?

321
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,946
Is anyone there?

322
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:20,487
Those idiots are trying to scare me.

323
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:22,690
You're so dumb!

324
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:29,467
Don't bother hiding, I saw you!

325
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,816
The tomb of samurai Hajime.

326
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,299
Leaving us so soon?

327
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:05,169
The samurai won't be long.

328
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:37,373
Apparently,
you don't enjoy our company.

329
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,601
Stay a while.

330
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,574
You won't be disappointed.

331
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:44,738
And the samurai will be delighted.

332
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:45,974
Stop!

333
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,051
Now, now, don't get upset, Sumako.

334
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,312
You look stressed out.

335
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,956
You seemed so dismissive of ghosts.

336
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:54,648
Tomoko? Michio?

337
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,591
You're going to die!

338
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,159
Stop!

339
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:41,336
Sumako.

340
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:51,338
Sumako. Sumako. Sumako.

341
00:41:12,263 --> 00:41:14,197
Michio!

342
00:41:24,141 --> 00:41:25,733
Sumako's brain

343
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:26,798
Is that you Sumako-chan?

344
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:39,415
Sumako?

345
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,012
Sumako?

346
00:42:47,057 --> 00:42:48,388
Sumako?

347
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:52,592
How was your first day?

348
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:08,910
So, Sumako-chan,
did you get to the end this time?

349
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:18,280
That's no good.

350
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:20,650
You have to see your dream
through to the end

351
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:23,316
if you want to be cured.

352
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,488
Cured.

353
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:50,086
I'm scared of helping to wreck the planet

354
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:53,485
and not having the courage to act.

355
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:55,284
I don't know what to do.

356
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:58,986
I do nothing, so I'm scared.
I'm scared, so I do nothing.

357
00:43:59,163 --> 00:44:02,621
I absolutely have to do something.

358
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,734
I have lots of little fears in my head,

359
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:12,569
going everywhere with me,
fencing me in.

360
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,878
Paralyzing me!

361
00:44:15,045 --> 00:44:17,172
Exist Sure, which way

362
00:44:17,348 --> 00:44:20,146
Inside Outside Up Down

363
00:44:25,022 --> 00:44:26,455
I'm scared of mankind.

364
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:28,455
They say man is a wolf for man.

365
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:30,992
But wolf isn't a man for wolf.

366
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:33,061
Wolves don't devour wolves.

367
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,825
But mankind.
Now, there's the dangerous animal.

368
00:44:37,001 --> 00:44:41,438
Exterminate animals. Pick flowers.
Massacre their own kind.

369
00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:44,733
Knock off the intellectuals,
proles, pure and impure,

370
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:47,309
on impulse, under duress,
the influence or orders.

371
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:50,572
A fuddled brain and do it, man!

372
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:54,616
And women are getting in on the act
at every level now.

373
00:44:54,785 --> 00:44:58,619
Woman is the future of man.
So smack you up, asshole.

374
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:01,189
I know my rights. Self-defense.

375
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:02,757
Pre-emptive action.

376
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:34,519
I wound up by chance

377
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:38,958
in a region where
I spent many summers as a boy.

378
00:45:40,931 --> 00:45:43,331
The great plains.

379
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:56,871
One of those summers
had been particularly strange.

380
00:45:57,047 --> 00:46:01,143
Everything began
with my uncle's disappearance.

381
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,710
He had gone poaching at night,

382
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:07,015
but his boat was found
washed up on the riverbank.

383
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:09,352
It was empty.

384
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:32,576
Every evening,
my aunt went to church to pray for him.

385
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,877
I went along too.

386
00:46:41,392 --> 00:46:42,984
While she wept,

387
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,823
I slipped outside to play with my friend.

388
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:08,343
Most evenings, at the same time,

389
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:11,579
the ducks left the marshes.

390
00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:20,387
From their behavior, we could guess
what the next few days held in store.

391
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:25,263
My friend,
who didn't really have any family

392
00:47:25,436 --> 00:47:27,904
and spent his time playing in the fields,

393
00:47:28,072 --> 00:47:31,701
knew an infinite number
of secrets about animals.

394
00:47:33,077 --> 00:47:38,674
One evening, the last duck in the line
had a broken wing.

395
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:40,180
According to my friend,

396
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:44,148
it was the work of
a wild beast on the loose.

397
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:50,521
And there was a chance
that we'd end up facing it one day.

398
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:56,093
That night, I slept clenching my eyes shut
as hard as I could

399
00:47:56,266 --> 00:47:59,429
to stop nightmares from getting in.

400
00:48:32,002 --> 00:48:36,939
Next morning, the police fished out
a peasant's mutilated head.

401
00:48:42,813 --> 00:48:46,112
A particularly atrocious crime.

402
00:48:46,283 --> 00:48:49,309
Who could have done such a thing

403
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:52,050
My friend knew.

404
00:48:52,222 --> 00:48:56,659
There are ferocious beasts
that descend from the clouds.

405
00:48:56,827 --> 00:49:00,354
One of them must be lurking
in the marshes.

406
00:49:34,932 --> 00:49:38,026
That evening, at my aunt's house,

407
00:49:38,202 --> 00:49:40,898
nobody said a word.

408
00:50:19,676 --> 00:50:21,576
And then, one afternoon,

409
00:50:21,745 --> 00:50:23,679
my friend disappeared as well.

410
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:28,784
The whole village joined the search.

411
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:37,191
The fog rose and rose.

412
00:50:40,797 --> 00:50:43,288
And I got lost.

413
00:50:43,467 --> 00:50:45,799
Like in a dream.

414
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:37,709
His bicycle had been found,

415
00:51:37,888 --> 00:51:41,517
but that didn't put my mind at rest.

416
00:51:44,695 --> 00:51:46,560
Night fell.

417
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,028
What I thought I had seen...

418
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:52,293
Was that my friend

419
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:55,336
Or was it the monster

420
00:51:55,505 --> 00:51:57,097
Unless, of course,

421
00:51:57,274 --> 00:52:00,539
they were one and the same creature

422
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:11,549
In the end, they decided to call in
the local town's head gamekeeper.

423
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:16,522
For a man who'd explored
mysterious African forests,

424
00:52:16,693 --> 00:52:22,325
wild beast or murderer
made not the slightest difference.

425
00:52:30,507 --> 00:52:33,374
He laid in wait for three days and nights

426
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:36,273
in the church's bell tower.

427
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:47,981
When he came down,

428
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:52,026
a savage odor hung over him.

429
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:57,959
He asked someone to fetch
the plumpest goose in the village.

430
00:52:58,135 --> 00:53:01,366
And he began setting his trap.

431
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:08,337
Women and children were kept away.

432
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:12,210
Nobody was allowed to make
the slightest noise.

433
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:24,141
From that day on,
nobody in the region disappeared.

434
00:55:24,314 --> 00:55:27,750
Even so, my uncle never returned.

435
00:55:27,918 --> 00:55:31,820
Even so, my friend was never found.

436
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:38,522
At church, ever since,

437
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:41,664
old women make offerings
to the crocodile,

438
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:44,459
claiming that it's to some saint or other

439
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:47,626
that they light their candles.

440
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:54,806
Some time later,

441
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:58,243
I woke in the middle of the night.

442
00:57:03,913 --> 00:57:08,748
It was my friend.
There was no doubt about it.

443
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:13,845
I was convinced I was right.

444
00:57:26,002 --> 00:57:29,062
We never saw each other again.

445
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:39,112
The day I stopped by the village
where the crocodile still hangs,

446
00:57:39,282 --> 00:57:42,843
this old story came back to me.

447
00:57:49,426 --> 00:57:54,989
I didn't dare wait for darkness
to overwhelm the countryside.

448
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:02,163
It was as if I was scared
of seeing my friend again.

449
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:07,503
Who knows what other secrets
he still kept

450
00:58:10,313 --> 00:58:16,411
Who knows if he, too,
hadn't descended from a cloud

451
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:21,167
I'm scared of looking down
on people who are different.

452
01:00:21,344 --> 01:00:26,008
As I can't accept myself as I am,
that's a problem.

453
01:00:26,182 --> 01:00:29,845
People who are like me,
I find depressing.

454
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:33,352
And that gives me a bad self-image.

455
01:00:36,025 --> 01:00:38,619
I'm scared of being
irredeemably bourgeois.

456
01:00:38,795 --> 01:00:42,196
I can't accept that.
How did I get that into my head

457
01:00:42,565 --> 01:00:45,625
Rich and poor disgust me.
The middle-class exasperate me.

458
01:00:45,802 --> 01:00:47,929
Help!

459
01:00:48,104 --> 01:00:51,335
Quickly! A monastery!
Authenticity! Peace!

460
01:00:51,507 --> 01:00:52,997
Real peace, huh No faking.

461
01:00:53,176 --> 01:00:55,804
No wicker chairs,
no Hollywood Scientologist

462
01:00:55,979 --> 01:00:58,174
howling his love in Tibetan.

463
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:05,421
I'm scared of indigestion.

464
01:01:05,588 --> 01:01:07,317
We stuff our faces like pigs.

465
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:10,220
That's right! Like pigs.

466
01:01:10,393 --> 01:01:14,090
Kids! We'll leave the crust for you.

467
01:01:14,264 --> 01:01:16,323
I'm scared of blushing
when I buy groceries.

468
01:01:16,499 --> 01:01:19,400
Sometimes, a chocolate mousse
is so good!

469
01:01:19,569 --> 01:01:22,402
It's industrial maybe, but it's good.

470
01:01:22,572 --> 01:01:23,903
And people with no money

471
01:01:24,073 --> 01:01:27,270
Look at her!
She buys only predigested food.

472
01:01:27,443 --> 01:01:28,910
Go for it, girl!

473
01:01:29,078 --> 01:01:31,546
Support the agro-food chain!

474
01:01:31,714 --> 01:01:34,547
Can't you see it's a con

475
01:01:38,388 --> 01:01:41,721
You see, I'm scared
of never being useful.

476
01:01:42,091 --> 01:01:45,925
For example, proving to a racist,
a single, tiny racist,

477
01:01:46,095 --> 01:01:49,622
that it's vile, stupid
and not nice to be racist.

478
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:52,768
I tried once or twice, gently.

479
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:54,369
Difficult to contain oneself,

480
01:01:54,537 --> 01:01:56,437
to stick to being
the open-minded democrat

481
01:01:56,606 --> 01:02:00,565
who still stands firm
on core values.

482
01:02:00,743 --> 01:02:02,335
He looks at me blankly.

483
01:02:02,512 --> 01:02:06,448
I'm making no impression.

484
01:02:06,616 --> 01:02:10,484
I can only preach to the converted.

485
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:14,083
Help!

486
01:02:14,257 --> 01:02:18,057
Cicero! Louise Michel! Montesquieu!
Martin Luther King! Benetton!

487
01:19:17,546 --> 01:19:20,140
THE END

488
01:20:58,146 --> 01:20:59,977
I'm scared of being nice.

489
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:04,244
It's horrible being nice.

490
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,353
How was life for you

491
01:21:07,756 --> 01:21:08,950
Nice.
