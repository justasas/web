00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,300
Are you alright? Hey!

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,900
Water...

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,400
Here.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,300
Here.

6
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,600
Today, is a day of welcoming the newbies.

7
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
In this arena,

8
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,200
money and strength are supreme!

9
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Wow! Who are all these people?

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
We wouldn't have landed in some tribe again, right?

11
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,800
Yuan Shuai, have you seen a cockfight?

12
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Never. But I have seen a dogfight.

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,500
Today, we are being treated as dogs in a dogfight.

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,900
Next, let us welcome our power king!

15
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,260
Wow!

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
How come he is that tall?! Is he still a person?

17
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,500
He... Is he a person?!

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,390
These two are our newbies.

19
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,300
To tell you the truth...

20
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,470
Don't be afraid, Yuan Shuai. No matter whether he's some king of strength or big gorilla,

21
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,200
we-we'll attack together.

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
<i>...can fight with the power king.</i>

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,600
But we still won't have a chance...

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
There is always a chance.

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,570
Staying alive is winning.

26
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,800
Dying is losing.

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,900
I want him. Within one incense time, I can pinch you to death 10 times.

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,600
- He wants to fight you.<br>- No. Older Bro Fei...

29
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,700
- Save me. I don't want to fight him.<br>- I...I will save you.

30
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,800
Unchain that little fat guy for me. Let him go in.

31
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
- Hey! Hey! Let me fight with him!<br>- I don't want to fight him...

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
- This one is quite weak...<br>- Let me fight with him!

33
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Yuan Shuai! Yuan Shuai! Run!

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,100
The competition starts now!

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
Let me fight with him!

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
Let go of me!

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,100
- Come over. <br>- Don't come near.

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,400
Wait! Let me tell you. I know martial arts!

39
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,110
Don't come near! I'll beat you to death!

40
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,600
Fierce tiger goes down the mountain!

41
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Fierce dragon crosses the river! White goose raises its wings!

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,100
You brat are playing dirty with me.

43
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
Yuan Shuai!

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Yuan Shuai!

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,900
Yuan Shuai!

46
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,100
Yuan Shuai!

47
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Yuan Shuai! Hold it together. I'll save you!

48
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,100
Older Bro Fei, during critical times, I can really depend on you!

49
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,900
- Are you alright?<br>- Yuan Shuai.

50
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,380
I'll protect you.

51
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,300
- Don't be afraid.<br>- No. No.

52
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,700
Don't be afraid. Don't come near!

53
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,590
The competition ends.

54
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,300
The result is... a tie!

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Older Bro Fei, we survived!

56
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey! Hey! Don't come near!

57
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Fight! Fight!

58
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Stop trying to act brave. Just go home.

59
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,900
Don't fight anymore. That's right.

60
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Find two more people and fight again.

61
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,600
Don't worry.

62
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
It's all thanks to me.

63
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,900
It's all thanks to you, Older Bro Fei.

64
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,000
All of you look! You, too, come here.

65
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,230
Come. Come. Come.

66
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,600
Everyone, look.

67
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,700
These are our newly arrived three dogs.

68
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,890
Look at this dog. Little.

69
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,400
Especially these two little dogs. These two...

70
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,800
Don't look at it being small.

71
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,300
It is very nimble.

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,000
His flesh is very buff.

73
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,600
If you boil it, the aroma will reach more than ten miles.

74
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Strong enrichment!

75
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,630
It enriches iron and blood, too.

76
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,500
Even if you eat his bone, it's very nourishing.

77
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,600
Very nourishing. Right.

78
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,000
- Hey!<br>- Are you buying a dog?

79
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,810
No. Hey.

80
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,800
That dog is a man's most loyal friend.

81
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,620
Everyone shouldn't eat dog meat. Am I right?

82
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,700
It's none of your business. How come it can't be eaten?

83
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
No.

84
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,770
It's you.

85
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,600
Aren't you that...

86
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,800
- Do you know him? Go back to work!<br>- Hey!

87
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,600
How can you hit other people?!

88
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,200
Do you dare push me? I'll hit you, too!

89
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,600
Hey, don't fight anymore!

90
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,500
Star Chart?

91
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,320
Catch him!

92
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,600
Hurry and catch him!

93
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Stop right there!

94
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,200
Stop!

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,700
Stop!

96
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Hurry and chase him! Stop right there! Stop running already!

97
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,300
- Stop!<br>- Please move aside!

98
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
Stop! Stop right there!

99
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,600
Look where you are going!

100
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,200
- Stop! Stop! He's there! Hurry and chase him!<br>- Hey!

101
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Don't run! Hurry! Stop!

102
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,400
Stop! Stop! Don't run!

103
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,400
Stop! Stop! Don't run!

104
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
Stop! Where are you running to?!

105
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,600
- You rascal, come out!<br>- Come out!

106
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
Search!

107
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,990
What do you think this place is?

108
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,800
You can just search as you want?

109
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Ming Zhen, let me tell you.

110
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,060
I am here to catch that rascal.

111
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,000
It has nothing to do with you.

112
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,900
Any matter here in this tavern is my matter.

113
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,600
Don't mind her. Search!

114
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,990
Ming Zhen, no need. No need.

115
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,700
Rascal, even if you are able to hide now, you can't hide forever!

116
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,600
Okay. Ming Zhen... just you wait and see. Wait and see.

117
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,200
Let's go. Ming Zhen!

118
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,910
You wait and see. Wait and see!

119
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's go.

120
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,210
Thank you, Heroine.

121
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,200
If you don't want to die, then just stay here to work.

122
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,340
- No. No.<br>- Can you not push me?

123
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,100
Get in.

124
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,200
- My bones have already loosened and scattered.<br>- No.

125
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
My foot has dislocated.

126
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
It's meal time! It's meal time!

127
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,350
- Older Bro Fei, don't push me down!<br>- I am not!

128
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,200
Hurry and steal!

129
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,800
You... a group of beasts...

130
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
You group of beasts!

131
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,000
You are beasts!

132
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,600
- Even food, you can't serve as enough to be full. How are we going to play?<br>- Just this much? We fought so hard earlier.

133
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,400
Older Bro Fei, I'm hungry...

134
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,500
Alright, i's okay. It's okay.

135
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Keep it. Keep it.

136
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,400
- Baldy. Oh, wrong. Big Bro. <br>- Big Bro.

137
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,200
- Big Bro, let me massage this for you for a while. Woah!<br>- Big Bro, you are really a good guy.

138
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
What a big and strong arm.

139
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,400
- What a stylish bald.<br>- Such a beautiful mustache--

140
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,370
Never thought that you were that lucky.

141
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,790
What do you mean?

142
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,800
When we welcome newbies, only one is able to come back alive every time.

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
We've never seen one where both came back.

144
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,000
You... Have you been here for a very long already?

145
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,000
<i>Due to the big waves, our boat capsized.</i>

146
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,090
<i>I was washed up to this small island.</i>

147
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,200
<i>I don't know how but I got dragged into here.</i>

148
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,940
<i>Let me out! Let me out!</i>

149
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,000
<i>Let me out!</i>

150
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,400
<i>Let me out! I want to find my daughter!</i>

151
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,800
<i>- I want to find my daughter!<br>- Shut up! Stop your nonsense!</i>

152
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,300
<i>Let me out!</i>

153
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,800
<i>- I want to find my daughter!<br>- Shut up!</i>

154
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,400
<i>Let go of me!</i>

155
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
<i>Attack!</i>

156
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
KoreanDramaX.co

157
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,400
This place is a hell on earth.

158
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey, then did you ever try escaping?

159
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,200
That's right.

160
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,820
Go to sleep.

161
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,400
You still have one round tomorrow.

162
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,550
Don't.

163
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,730
You must tell us.

164
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,300
We need to escape from here.

165
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Our friends are waiting for us.

166
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
Friends?

167
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,400
You better take care of yourselves first.

168
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,000
People who still don't know if they will survive tomorrow or not,

169
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
why ask so many questions?

170
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Ming Zhen, the price you gave for this batch of products is too low.

171
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
The highest, 500 liang*.<br>(* Chinese money)

172
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,800
No. 900 liang.

173
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,300
500 liang is a reasonable price.

174
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,730
You should remove the word reasonable.

175
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,610
This product is something that I exchanged my life to get.

176
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,170
My place is a tavern, not a hospital.

177
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,300
I'm not responsible in treating people.

178
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,350
Ming Zhen, I know.

179
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,700
That rascal is just here in your tavern.

180
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,400
Just hand him over to me, okay?

181
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,000
Hand him over to me!

182
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,600
Boss, your eyebrows are gone.

183
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
Your mustache is also gone.

184
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,940
Ming Zhen!

185
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,600
Go. Go.

186
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,300
Quickly go. Quickly go.

187
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,500
I'll say it again.

188
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Either 55 or 500 liang.

189
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,960
Okay. Deal.

190
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,800
- How about it?<br>- Your so hateful.

191
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,190
- Are you happy?<br>- Did you like what I bought for you?

192
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,400
I like it.

193
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
- I'll buy you another one next time.<br>- Okay.

194
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,800
- Hey, Mister Feng. You can't enter here.<br>- Mister Feng, you can't enter here.

195
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
I just want to enter this room.

196
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,600
What?! Newcomer? Not allowed to be seen?

197
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,400
- I have the money.<br>- Hey, Mister Feng.

198
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,210
<i>- Mister Feng. <br>- Lady Boss has instructed us.</i>

199
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,000
<i>The newcomer has quite a wild personality.</i>

200
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,600
We will just look for another one for you.

201
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,070
Wild?

202
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,000
I just love wild ones.

203
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,740
Hey, Mister Feng!

204
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,200
Mister! Mister!

205
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,400
Hey, her look isn't quite bad.

206
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
No wonder you are locked up and not allowed to see customers.

207
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,200
Come. Come. Accompany me to drink.

208
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
Mister Feng, are you alright?

209
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,400
Get lost.

210
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,100
I just love fierce ones.

211
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,200
Hey, are you leaving this soon? Not even informing me first.

212
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,480
This lady really is quite a beauty.

213
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,200
Her martial arts are also very good.

214
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,100
She's way stronger than these useless men under me.

215
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,290
Hello, my name is Sayuri Sakai.

216
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,000
I still don't know your name.

217
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,210
I am A Ji Ya. I just passed by this place.

218
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,400
We are strangers meeting by chance.

219
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,200
Hope Older Sister won't make things difficult for me.

220
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,000
Strangers meeting by chance?

221
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Okay. Then let's be friends.

222
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,500
I am also just older than you by a few years so just call me Older Sister.

223
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,000
I also have read several books. A Ji Ya is a good name.

224
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,400
It means destiny.

225
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,900
Indeed.

226
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,500
How come this skin of yours is so smooth and soft?

227
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,400
You are really making me envious.

228
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,200
Can you tell me how you foreigners take care of your skin?

229
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,300
This... I don't know much.

230
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Starting today, you should learn how to take good care of skin.

231
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,000
A woman's skin is the weakest.

232
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,450
You are not like me who only secludes on the second line.

233
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,600
You still have to fight on the front line.

234
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
What do you mean?

235
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,630
I saved you so you now belong to me.

236
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,100
This is the rule on this island.

237
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,000
You earning money for me, that is your duty.

238
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,200
A person should learn how to show gratitude. Isn't that so?

239
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,400
I thank Older Sister for saving my life.

240
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,710
But as for Older Sister's request, I can't agree to it.

241
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,500
I still have to go find my friends.

242
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Is this place not good?

243
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,600
I saved you from the traffickers.

244
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,400
I spent so much energy and money for it.

245
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
Even if you don't give considerations to the monk, you should give one to Buddha, right?

246
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,400
- Older Sister, so sorry. I really can't do as you want.<br>- Stay right there!

247
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,800
Do you really think I have the interest to talk reasons with you here?

248
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,130
Drag her away.

249
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,800
Watch her well.

250
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,330
A girl who doesn't know what's good for her.

251
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,400
I should also go back and have my beauty sleep.

252
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,200
Don't bother me again for such things.

253
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Yes!

254
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,500
Put it in there.

255
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,600
Those friends I told you about, have you seen them?

256
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,400
Don't worry. These past few days, I have been taking note of it.

257
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,900
- Once there is any news, I'll immediately inform you.<br>- Okay.

258
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,000
- Thank you.<br>- Okay.

259
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,060
Be careful on your way.

260
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,700
Slave combat. Always exciting everyday.

261
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,200
Remember to go.

262
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
Here. Have one.

263
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,600
Hey!

264
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
- That...<br>- What?

265
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,000
This... Is this a fat guy?

266
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,400
That's right.

267
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,600
By his side, is there still a slightly taller and thinner guy?

268
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
That's right.

269
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,000
Can you take me to see them?

270
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Based on what?

271
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,500
Look.

272
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,100
Here. Take it.

273
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Take me to see your boss. Okay?

274
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,730
Hey, meal time! Meal time!

275
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,310
Woah!

276
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,810
Hurry and eat. Tomorrow, it's up to you guys.

277
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,690
Wow!

278
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,570
Has the sky changed? How come they are being so nice?

279
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,320
- There's even a drumstick.<br>- Earlier I heard them talking about something...

280
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,020
He seems to have said that if this drumstick was cooked for an hour more, it might taste better.

281
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,230
How come you only know how to eat?

282
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,300
Or else what?

283
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,230
They were talking about... about... seeing what our fate will be tomorrow.

284
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,660
What does it mean?

285
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,430
Don't know.

286
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,200
- This drumstick...<br>- No...

287
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,090
No. We don't want it.

288
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,320
What's going on?

289
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,380
i don't know.

290
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,220
While there is a drumstick, just hurry and eat it.

291
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,960
The people in here have not eaten any drumstick yet.

292
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,970
Why?

293
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,970
Aren't there chicken drumsticks in the kitchen?

294
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,630
The chicken drumsticks in the kitchen are for the Power King.

295
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,300
- Ha?<br>- Only people who are fighting with him get to have a drumstick.

296
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,420
It's just that...

297
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,500
It's just that what?

298
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,350
Hurry and say it. How come you stopped midway?

299
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,740
It's just that people who have eaten a chicken drumstick have never returned.

300
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,330
Never returned?

301
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,430
Older Bro Fei, does it mean we can get out?

302
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,820
Never returning means we have to forever stay in the arena.

303
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,780
How can this be called a chicken drumstick?

304
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,900
This is totally arsenic.

305
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,230
It's not even as good as arsenic.

306
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,270
If you die because of eating arsenic, you don't even need to get beaten up before dying.

307
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,460
Let me out! Let me out!

308
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,080
I still don't want to die.

309
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,560
Older Bro Fei, I still want to live longer.

310
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,730
I still want to eat lots of food.

311
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,350
I still don't want to die!

312
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,440
Stop being noisy already.

313
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,150
You won't die.

314
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Older Bro Fei. Older Bro Fei.

315
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,590
You are so smart so you must have an idea already, right?

316
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,820
How come it's so few?

317
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,280
These are 500 liang.

318
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,060
We worked hard for 2 months. Once we divide this among us, it's not even enough to buy a woman.

319
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,900
Didn't we already agree to sell them for 900 liang?

320
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,060
How come there is only 500 liang?

321
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,360
Only 500 liang?

322
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:56,770
Captain, our buddies are complaining that their share is quite few.

323
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,580
What do you mean?

324
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,570
Some people are saying...

325
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,870
that you personally pocketed the money.

326
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,920
I, Cheng Ming Pan,

327
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,180
am not that kind of person.

328
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,900
I know that with captain's character, you won't do such things.

329
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,730
But our buddies just want an explanation.

330
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,380
How come the money we got this time is so few?

331
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,190
Right.

332
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,610
I know.

333
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,160
I know that you all are discontented.

334
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,450
You found a captain and followed him

335
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,130
just for him to bear the responsibility that you all can't bear and to make appropriate decisions!

336
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,780
So as to preserve your own interest.

337
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,950
In this world, only money and power are most realistic.

338
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,240
Money may be lost

339
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,670
but power will never be lost.

340
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,500
Let me tell you.

341
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,740
What others can't do, I can do.

342
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,630
What others can't defeat, I can defeat.

343
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,190
If I say that I can't do it,

344
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,160
then on this island,

345
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,180
none can do it.

346
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,750
Let's go.

347
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,010
You people let go of me! Let go of me!

348
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,710
- Are you blind?!<br>- Who is this?

349
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,850
Captain, we picked him up on the beach two days ago.

350
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,710
Let's try to get along. Let's try to get along.

351
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,310
This... Who is the one paying for all these?

352
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,520
Ladies, go disperse now.

353
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,990
Disperse. Disperse.

354
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,790
Go. Let's go.

355
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,590
He is a Toyo man.

356
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,290
You all know that I am a Toyo man and do you still treat me like this?

357
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,290
You all will die tragically!

358
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,400
- Come! Throw him into the ocean to feed the fishes!<br>- Yes!

359
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,300
- Get up!<br>- Wait! Wait! Wait!

360
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,480
I can tell you all a chance to get rich.

361
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,550
A chance to get super rich.

362
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,930
It is 100 times more than the money you earn right now.

363
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,340
You all leave.

364
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,690
Yes!

365
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,600
Come. Sit. Sit.

366
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,290
Let me tell you.

367
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,390
On a mysterious small island,

368
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,480
there is a very valuable treasure that's worth several cities.

369
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,880
- Are you talking about the Money Island?<br>- That's right.

370
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,320
The legend of Money Island is known even by a three-year-old child.

371
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,800
Did you think I'd believe it?

372
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,230
It's up to you to believe it or not.

373
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,930
Everyone does know about it,

374
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,400
but who really went to find it? Think about it.

375
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,050
Don't be rash. Listen to me.

376
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,650
We Toyo warriors believe one saying the most.

377
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,560
Chance is given to people who loves to take risks.

378
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,750
Think about it. Did I endured numerous dangers and hardships to come here

379
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,740
just because of a legend?

380
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,990
I am thinking on your behalf.

381
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,200
I am giving you a chance.

382
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,510
Look at those sailors of yours.

383
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,650
They only see money.

384
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,660
Without money, you don't even get the power to rule them.

385
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,240
I'm afraid your captain position might be hard to keep.

386
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,370
You can choose not to believe what I'm saying.

387
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,250
Go to the island and ask about it.

388
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,040
There surely is someone who knows this secret.

389
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,990
It's just that they won't tell you.

390
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,150
Won't share it with you.

391
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,950
What you are talking about is...

392
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,710
Ming Zhen?

393
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,630
Smart.

394
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,110
Just because you say that they are your friends,

395
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,720
you are asking me to let them go.

396
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,240
Little child, you are too naive.

397
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,900
In this world, there are no free things.

398
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,150
Okay. Then you tell me. In what way will you set them free?

399
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,050
Very simple.

400
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,550
Everything in here are merchandise.

401
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,710
As long as you are able to have enough of that,*<br>(* money)

402
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,410
you can take anyone away.

403
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,330
You want money, is that it?

404
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,080
Okay. How much?

405
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,790
Let's not first talk about money.

406
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,210
This little fatty

407
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,530
is currently loved by the audience.

408
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,030
He is my precious.

409
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,530
I really kind of can't bear to let him go.

410
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,640
Didn't you say that if I have the money, you will let them go?

411
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,020
Just say it. How much money do you want?

412
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,780
Can you see this box?

413
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,660
In it is all the betting money.

414
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,680
During the competition, this money will grow more and more.

415
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,770
As long as by that time, you can give me twice the amount,

416
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,360
you can take the people away.

417
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,170
You clearly don't want to set them free!

418
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,570
If you won't accept it, I won't try to force you.

419
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,410
Okay.

420
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,540
I accept it.

421
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,560
But you must first let me see them.

422
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,830
They, you can't.

423
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,260
Just seeing one, you can.

424
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,360
Pull that little fatty up here.

425
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,290
Yes!

426
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:07,010
KoreanDramaX.co

427
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,190
Miss. Miss.

428
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,630
Miss, wake up.

429
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,260
It's time to eat.

430
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,620
What is your name?

431
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,290
My name is Ah Chang.

432
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,230
Ah Chang?

433
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,160
My foot seemed wounded.

434
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,480
Do you have any medicine?

435
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,080
These exact medicines I have will be useful.

436
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,060
Being a woman and going on fights outside,

437
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,190
why didn't you prepare some medicines?

438
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,450
You really are very considerate.

439
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,240
That who, has my Younger Sis eaten yet?

440
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,540
She still hasn't.

441
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,340
What is this thing?

442
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,640
Her foot is injured.

443
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,770
I brought her some medicine.

444
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:01,580
You are quite considerate.

445
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,130
- Leave first.<br>- Yes.

446
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,380
What really are you planning to do to me?

447
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,920
You are my precious treasure.

448
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,410
How can I bear to do anything to you?

449
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,240
I am even hoping for you to earn money for me.

450
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,470
By that time, the two of us can be rich.

451
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,190
Once we divide the money,

452
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,770
wandering the ends of the world and travelling around the world,

453
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:27,090
who would be willing to stay in this god-forsaken and inhumane island?

454
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,230
Let me tell you. I will never do any of those things you are telling me to do.

455
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,790
You better just give up on this idea.

456
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,670
Younger Sister,

457
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,280
a person should learn to be grateful.

458
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,710
If not because I saved you,

459
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,560
you already don't know where you're at now.

460
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,800
I even give you good food and drinks everyday.

461
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,080
Why don't you just let me work in the kitchen?

462
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:56,370
Will I let a beautiful lady work in the kitchen?

463
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,590
Am I insane?

464
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,480
You are indeed insane.

465
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,030
Younger Sister,

466
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,600
just listen to my advice.

467
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,470
Just do your job well.

468
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,660
You tell me, you are just staying in this place everyday, what can you do?

469
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,860
Listen to me.

470
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,990
I guarantee that your future life will have endless glory and wealth.

471
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,250
These are all high quality cosmetics.

472
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,730
Style yourself well.

473
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,460
You must be beautiful.

474
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,190
A woman... should be beautiful.

475
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,790
As long as you are beautiful,

476
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,970
let's talk about some other things.

477
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,980
I thank Older Sister for saving me.

478
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,180
But for the matter you want me to do, I can't do it.

479
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,030
Too bad, it's not up to you.

480
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,490
Such a pretty lady,

481
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,260
that even my heart flutters just by looking at you.

482
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,760
Not just five years ago,

483
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,620
even 10 years ago, my skin isn't as good as yours.

484
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,910
Really so envious.

485
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,540
I am giving you one chance to get the top beauty position.

486
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,420
Once you have decided, tell it to me.

487
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,860
Let's go.

488
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,710
<i>I don't know where Bai Ze and the others are right now.</i>

489
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,250
<i>How come I still am thinking about them?</i>

490
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,220
<i>They have no relations with me at all.</i>

491
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,760
- Get over there.<br>- Bai Ze!

492
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,250
- Yuan Shuai!<br>- Move away!

493
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,560
Yuan Shuai, how are you and Xiong Fei?

494
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,180
We both are doing good.

495
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,980
I thought that I would never be able to see you anymore.

496
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,150
It's all my fault. I don't have the ability to save you from those human traffickers.

497
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,540
Why must you still say all this now?

498
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,340
We all have no freedom to act independently now.

499
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,330
Have you found A Ji Ya?

500
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,090
Not yet.

501
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,500
I plan to save you and Xiong Fei first

502
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,230
and then let's look for A Ji Ya together.

503
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,180
- Okay.<br>- Enough already.

504
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,930
You already saw the person and talked to him.

505
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,000
Just think of a way to gather the money now.

506
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,500
Take him away.

507
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,580
Go!

508
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,880
Wait for me! Once I'm able to come up with the money, I surely will come back to save you!

509
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,470
If something bad happens to me and Older Bro Fei,

510
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,430
help me tell Thirteenth Older Sis that we are having a good life in a far away place.

511
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,890
We will forever miss her!

512
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,340
- Remember!<br>- Stop saying nonsense!

513
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,190
Hey!

514
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,380
I will surely bring you the money before the competition starts.

515
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,300
But you must not hurt my friends.

516
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,660
I believe you.

517
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,450
Go now.

518
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,700
<i>Your sailors only see money.</i>

519
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,910
<i>Without money, you don't even get the power to rule them.</i>

520
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,710
<i>Your captain position won't be stable.</i>

521
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,290
Captain, our boss is here.

522
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,000
- You can leave now.<br>- Yes.

523
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,890
It's so late already. Captain wants to see me for what reasons?

524
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,040
Actually, we can work together.

525
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,360
How?

526
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,030
I know. You have stayed the longest here on this island.

527
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,460
You surely know where the treasure is.

528
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,180
Even a three-year-old child knows that there is no treasure on this island.

529
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,990
Let me tell you. This island...

530
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,100
I have the greatest strength.

531
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,680
If you won't tell me the location of the treasure,

532
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,360
I am making an oath that I will let you have nothing.

533
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,320
If you really feel that this island has a treasure,

534
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,010
then just go look for it yourself.

535
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,650
If you find it, it's all yours.

536
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,940
I don't want any of it.

537
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,550
Okay.

538
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:34,420
You're not saying the truth, is that it?

539
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,170
Just you wait then.

540
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,530
Miss, are you better?

541
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,290
I'm better.

542
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,350
- You... are Ah Chang, right?<br>- Right.

543
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,640
Do you have a family?

544
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,960
Ah Chang, those... I'm giving them to you. Give them to your wife.

545
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,650
I am just a food server. I don't have any family.

546
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,020
What's the meaning of that?!

547
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,970
Who says that a food server can't have any family of their own?

548
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:38,420
Ah Chang, have you thought about living a new kind of life?

549
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,520
You go to work outside while she is at home washing clothes,

550
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,320
cooking, and raising your children.

551
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:50,030
When you go home, there will be warm dishes waiting for you to eat.

552
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,860
When you are doing nothing, you all go out to stroll the town,

553
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,640
to watch plays,

554
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,260
to do anything that you want to do.

555
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,760
Ah Chang, why must you let yourself suffer by staying here?

556
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,510
Isn't Sakai like you, wanting to escape this place and live a more wonderful life?

557
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,770
How come you won't?

558
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,100
- Come with me.<br>- Ah Chang, you...

559
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,230
Don't say anything anymore. Come with me.

560
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,890
Hurry.

561
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,110
Here.

562
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,600
Hurry.

563
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,990
Stop! Stop!

564
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,600
What time is it?

565
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,300
Will you still let people sleep?

566
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,530
Not even choosing a good time to escape...

567
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,160
- I'm begging you already. Just let me borrow the money.<br>- No.

568
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,200
Before it was because I saw you wander into here

569
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,090
and were being chased, I felt you were quite pitiful

570
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,110
so I helped you.

571
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,820
I already gave you extreme benevolence and did my utmost duty.

572
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,370
Don't dare ask for more.

573
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,560
Believe me.

574
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,400
Just loan me the money first, I will definitely pay it back.

575
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,060
You are just talking and not showing me anything to hold on to.

576
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,090
How can I believe you?

577
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,030
Actually, I am the capital's...

578
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,150
I went out to sea this time because I have to do an important mission.

579
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,190
Who would have thought that we would encounter a sea disaster midway,

580
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,810
my friends and I got separated.

581
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,500
I am borrowing money in order to save them.

582
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,930
How about this?

583
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,120
As long as I can go back,

584
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,290
I'll immediately send men to bring you the money.

585
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,050
If I believe everything that I hear,

586
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,940
I won't be able to live up to now.

587
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,080
You must know.

588
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,950
In this world, no one is duty bound to help you.

589
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,480
Okay. Then tell me.

590
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,390
On what conditions will you be willing to help me?

591
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:31,550
I won't lend it to you no matter what.

592
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,080
Hey... Hey!

593
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,010
You tell me, you two,

594
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:38,070
can't even choose a good time.

595
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,960
Didn't I tell you to take good care of your skin?

596
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,410
Look at you. You must have not slept well last night, right?

597
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,730
Your black eye circles have all come out.

598
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,030
Don't say anything anymore.

599
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,200
I will not listen to you.

600
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,320
Just let me die.

601
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,780
Hey... stop mentioning death.

602
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,220
Who doesn't know how to die?

603
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,210
A person should live with a bit of meaning.

604
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,660
If I am like you choosing to die every time I encounter a problem,

605
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,740
I would have died a hundred times.

606
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,170
Stop your nonsense! Just kill me!

607
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,910
You are just young but you have such a bad temper.

608
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,580
Always getting angry will make you age fast.

609
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,100
You should try smiling more.

610
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,170
You're even lecturing me? Don't you also want to escape?

611
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,180
Fallacy.

612
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,990
No one is hindering or stopping you, yet you still stay on this island.

613
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,880
You even have the nerve to scold these people who want to die?

614
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,300
Every person has their predicaments.

615
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,450
Tell me. What method must I use to make you stay?

616
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,250
How about this? I'll make a deal with you.

617
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,190
Aren't you looking for your friend?

618
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,860
Tell me his name and what he looks like.

619
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,390
If you agree to stay,

620
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,600
I'll then help you find your friend.
