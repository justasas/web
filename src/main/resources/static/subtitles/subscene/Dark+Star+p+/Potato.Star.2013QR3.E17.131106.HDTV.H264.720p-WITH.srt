1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,430
What happened with that thing?

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,900
You found it?

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,100
No. Not yet.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,940
The lady asked me to sleep in the living room.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,410
Then you should go in when
everyone sleeps.

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,340
As the ajussi keeps going to the toilet,
I don't get that much time.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,850
Definitely find it today. Right past the weekend,
the DNA test results will be out.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,200
You hate getting money?

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,110
No.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,620
I am dying from anxiety.

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,250
Has No Min Hyeok come home?

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,040
No.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,490
How is No Min Hyeok's situation?
Have you heard anything?

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,230
No.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,800
It's only 'no' all along, huh?
You know no other word but "no'?

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,530
No.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,630
There, again!

18
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,570
Wouldn't you hear something
they can't avoid saying?

19
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,140
There's nothing special 
that they're saying.

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,440
Also, our contract from the beginning was
for me to only find the USB, wasn't it?

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,270
I need to even report that man's condition?

22
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,940
The contract may be so, but shouldn't you
be doing such stuff as free service?

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,150
Think how worried I must be, 
to be doing this.

24
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,550
That terrible guy stole my files and 
is after my life, making me crazy.

25
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,390
Are they such bad guys?

26
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,590
Don't you know after seeing them?
So bad that I can't even tell you!

27
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,890
Imagine your worst, and they are
worse than even that!

28
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,360
They don't look so bad to me.

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,930
Do bad guys have "bad" written
on their foreheads?

30
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,130
Hurry back there today and 
find it without fail!

31
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,700
Report to me right when you find it.
Hurry up. Go, go, go!

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,540
Sure.

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,370
Go, go, go!

34
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,840
You mean, go out?

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,410
Go, go, go... How many times should I say?

36
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,180
Can't you drop me near the house?
I don't have the taxi fare.

37
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,170
<i>Practicing?</i>

38
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,050
<i>It's the weekend tomorrow. Shall we meet?</i>

39
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,390
Anyhow, he's slow. So slow.

40
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,060
A reply will come at least 
tomorrow morning, right?

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,710
What's the deal? So fast?

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,200
<i>Su Yeong, can I see you for a moment?</i>

43
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,770
Oh, come here, come here, come here.

44
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,340
You went somewhere so early in the morning?

45
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,810
Yes. To see a friend.

46
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,640
You had breakfast?

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,210
Come close here. Come close.

48
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,150
My waist was hurting, so I couldn't come down.

49
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,190
I wanted to see him so much the whole night.

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,220
=Quite suddenly this morning,=
=a 2 million kilowatt generator=

51
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,530
=at the Panbit nuclear plant developed=
=problems and stopped operating,=

52
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,830
=again causing an emergency in power supply.=

53
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,400
<i>=The government has convened=
=an urgent response meeting.=</i>

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,070
Yet again? Starting from summer, 
power supply has kept failing.

55
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,810
It's all those corrupt guys taking bribes.
What's becoming off our country?

56
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,040
Those corrupt guys taking bribes went
completely unpunished, that's why.

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,510
Isn't it our family who bribes?

58
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,350
Mom, at the Olympics time,
you sent cash in apple cases.

59
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,700
That's how we got rich, right?

60
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,020
- You brat! 
- Shut up.

61
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,150
Julien.

62
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,850
Su Yeong. Were you doing well?

63
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,560
Yeah.

64
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,500
- Julien, now I... 
- I...

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,330
I'm going back to New York.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,470
You are dating that guy called Jang Yeol, right?
(It means "stomach fever")

67
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,670
It is not Jang Yeol. 
It's Jang Yul.

68
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,340
Anyway, I think I'll let go of you.

69
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,180
I'm really sorry.

70
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,010
You don't need to apologize.

71
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,580
It's possible for love to change too, I guess.

72
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,890
A asked to see you to tell you this 
as the last words.

73
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,460
Take care, Su Yeong.

74
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,590
Stay healthy and take care.

75
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,800
You too, Su Yeong.

76
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,470
Bye.

77
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,910
Adios.
(Adios - farewell in Spanish)

78
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,410
Sounds good. See you tomorrow.

79
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,180
What shall we do tomorrow?

80
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,650
That's not it.

81
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,180
If I ask a question, who knows
when a reply will happen?

82
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,880
<i>Let's have fun watching a movie tomorrow.</i>

83
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,460
<i>In front of the Cheong Dam CGV at 3 o'clock.
(CGV - Movie theater chain)</i>

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,800
It seemed the business was going well.
It's now for rent?

85
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,370
Yes. We had some issues.

86
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,940
How much is the rental deposit for such a place?

87
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,980
What? 50 million Wons? You squandered all my
money, and still dare to say this?
(~US$ 50K)

88
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,450
Don't jump the gun, you wretched girl.

89
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,910
You think I won't jump the gun, now?

90
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,380
50 million is some child's play?

91
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,150
Who said do it now? Anyway, there's no money.
I just happened to say it.

92
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,190
The location was great. The rent was
extremely cheap too.

93
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,480
All we needed was 50 million--

94
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,760
I said stop it. Please!

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,700
What's your problem?
I can't even speak to myself?

96
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,800
Others should hear you talk to yourself?

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
You make me laugh, seriously.

98
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,200
What am I doing to make you laugh?

99
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,930
Come on, how long can we be living like this?

100
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,510
Stop your crap! Stop creating trouble,
just stay put nicely.

101
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,180
You're just great, I guess. 
I need to take a dump.

102
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,280
I'm eating here... seriously!

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,750
What?

104
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,580
Look at you talk, not even letting
people talk to themselves, really!

105
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,050
Why do you say that to yourself?

106
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,720
If you need a toilet trip, do it as much as you like.
Why say it out that you'll take a dump?

107
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,390
Ah, really! I can't even talk, 
all afraid of a daughter.

108
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,590
Have some mango please.

109
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,630
Father. Dong Gyu's father has
passed away, I hear.

110
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,730
Is that so?

111
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,830
When is his funeral?

112
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,930
In two days.

113
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,130
I'll just use the bathroom.

114
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,700
Go ahead. Go ahead.

115
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,740
What about Hongberg and me?

116
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,270
You both used to stick so close together.
Did anything happened?

117
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,610
There's nothing. What if there is?

118
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,650
You were born so cute.
Why is even your face so useless?

119
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,120
What's with you?

120
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,520
May be like I was a hedgehog,
you were cute only in my eyes?

121
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,990
Now on, you better start 
listening to what I say.

122
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,460
I won't. I don't want to listen.

123
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,930
You wretched girl.

124
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,760
I will say just one thing.

125
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,970
It's about the next-door youngster.

126
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,640
Bracing for his debut as the real son,
you quickly bite on to him.

127
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,100
What?

128
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,300
Just now when I was in the house,
I saw him eating mangoes.

129
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,440
He isn't even proven to be the real son
but he's eating such expensive mangoes.

130
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,750
Could he indeed be proven as the real son?
When that thought flashed in,

131
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,950
I wondered what we should do now?

132
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,890
Don't they say that everyone has
3 chances in a lifetime?

133
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,460
To us, this is the first of those, right now.

134
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,190
Geez! Really.

135
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,590
Listen to me. Before he is proven as the real son,
this is our last chance.

136
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,060
If he's proven to be the real one,

137
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,000
it will look like we got close with ulterior motives.
We aren't in his league either.

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,830
It is already a bit late.

139
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,140
But we can think that we are late
only because time went by fast.

140
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,340
Once the test results come out, 
it's over, okay?

141
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,280
- Oh, for God's sake, such-- 
- Shut, shut, shut the heck up.

142
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,410
From what I see, he's very innocent. If you
go after him properly, he is hooked, no doubt.

143
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,350
If I were just 10 years younger, even I would've
made a move, really.

144
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,820
Oh, yeah? What's with you, really?

145
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,020
If he is not, what then, after all this fuss?

146
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,220
If he isn't, nothing to lose, right?

147
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,890
Listen to my words. Bite him quickly.
Bite right away. Bite without a doubt!

148
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,730
Satisfied?

149
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,830
Yike Yike Yikes Yikes.

150
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,660
Don't say anymore. He and I are 
casual-enough to talk of even poop.

151
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,770
What if you talk poop?

152
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,060
Anyway, once married, it's all fair game.

153
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,840
You talk of poop and marry,
or marry and talk of poop.

154
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,540
Oh, please! Stop talking nonsense.

155
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,640
What was nonsense in that?

156
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,470
I hate to death being like that with him. What?

157
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,570
What?

158
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,780
What's so great about you
to be so high and mighty?

159
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,880
Just a high school grad...

160
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,610
What?

161
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,450
Look at you Mom, seriously. 
High school grad, what?

162
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,850
Honestly, in your conditions, if you try finding
a man, you really think it'll be a great guy?

163
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,420
Even on Lottos of 1 in eight million chance,
people try their luck.

164
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,260
Doesn't this have a much higher 
chance for success?

165
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,720
Why won't you even attempt it?

166
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,130
Attempt, my foot! It's to grab 50 million Wons by
using me that you've turned ruthless now, right?

167
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,700
Try to dare talk about this again!

168
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,370
Whom does she take after? Such bad temper!

169
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,570
We don't have much time.

170
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,380
<i>You found it?</i>

171
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,480
<i>Not yet.</i>

172
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,050
<i>Find it fast. What are you doing?</i>

173
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,130
Him? I'm seeing him. Why?

174
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,740
How come he is sleeping like this?

175
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,800
No, I wasn't talking to you.

176
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,410
I'm hungry, so I need to 
make some night snacks.

177
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,980
My special diet supper snack.

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,940
How come he is sleeping like this?

179
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,930
<i>Jun Hyeok!</i>

180
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,240
<i>Jun Hyeok!</i>

181
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,280
Did you call me?

182
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,110
You're not sleeping?

183
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,310
I just called, wondering if you were.

184
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,410
What is the matter?

185
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,080
I woke up too early.

186
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,390
I'm sorry but could you please help me?

187
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,220
Because my waist hurts.

188
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,060
Okay.

189
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
This rascal...

190
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,770
Aigoo, you precious rascal.

191
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,600
This is nice.

192
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,270
It's great to take half body baths at midnight.

193
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,210
It's my secret to longevity.

194
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,510
I am done. You try it.

195
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,980
No, it's all right.

196
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,380
Listen to me and try it once.
It's really great!

197
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,520
Green hills...

198
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,040
- Feel great?
- Yes.

199
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,340
Like I did, you should sing too.

200
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,540
This has the effects of abdominal breathing.

201
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,210
It stretches out your vocals and body.
It's great!

202
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,050
Okay.

203
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,090
Green hills...

204
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,590
How sad that you're leaving!

205
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,530
This is for you to eat on the plane.

206
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,360
Thank you ajumma.
(ajumma - older lady, aunt)

207
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,140
Anyway, because of that wicked girl, you came all
the way to Korea, only to stay in a sauna room.

208
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,340
Isn't your flight leaving much later?

209
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,540
Before you leave, go and have a tour of Seoul.

210
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,840
Seoul? It's not a city I really wish to remember.

211
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,780
Even then, when will you
ever be back to see it?

212
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,880
Yeah.

213
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,080
I heard there there are those tour buses.

214
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,120
Shouldn't you take the tour and 
see what Seoul looks like?

215
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,300
What are you writing so seriously
since a while back?

216
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,500
You don't need to know.

217
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,430
It's to stay alive that I struggle like this.

218
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,170
Struggle with what?

219
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,740
You don't need to know.

220
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:32,080
Don't have any clothes. Clothes.

221
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,550
What are you doing?

222
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,280
Going out somewhere?

223
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,480
Yeah, an appointment. Why?

224
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
If it's not important, postpone it.

225
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,790
Grandpa and Dad are attending a funeral.

226
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,360
I need to go Min Hyeok's hospital.
Then will anyone be here?

227
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,820
Bo Yeong also has a school parents' meeting.

228
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,290
What if no one is at home?

229
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,130
Isn't it weird to leave him alone at home?

230
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,230
So what if he's left here?

231
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,700
When are the test results out?

232
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,100
Monday.

233
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,690
Will it really be Jun Hyeok?

234
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,100
I don't know.

235
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,940
I think there's just no way he can be.

236
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,140
Anyway, you just stay at home. 
Understood?

237
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,170
I can't. I have an important appointment.
Am I like a watchdog?

238
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,740
I shall keep a good watch!

239
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,310
I'll be home only at night.
See you later.

240
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,050
Okay.

241
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,980
The maid and Su Yeong will be at home. 
If you need anything, let them know.

242
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,080
Okay.

243
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,120
I'm going. If you get bored, take a 
half body bath. It's excellent.

244
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,960
Yes.

245
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,370
Everyone has left?

246
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,840
Yes.

247
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,040
My mother asked me to keep a eye on you.

248
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,610
If I'm not around, will you steal anything?

249
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:39,980
What?

250
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,920
Are you a thief? Or a bad guy?

251
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,650
No.

252
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,120
Then I am leaving now.

253
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,050
My leaving is a secret from mom. 
OK?

254
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:53,560
Why aren't you answering? OK?

255
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,030
Yes. Ok.

256
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,900
(Speaking Spanish)

257
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,470
<i>Seoul. A city that I really don't 
want to ever remember again.</i>

258
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,670
<i>No coming back here again.</i>

259
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,970
<i>Heartbreak city, Seoul.</i>

260
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,160
Setting his sights on what's a bit too high!

261
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,090
This man, why is he still not here?

262
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,280
Where are you going?

263
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,580
I didn't see.

264
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,250
How can you not recognize
even your girlfriend?

265
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,820
I have a bit of 'un-face-recognizitis'.

266
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,030
What?

267
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,270
This would usually be done by a man.

268
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,830
It's because you're busy with performances
that I'm doing it, understand?

269
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,040
Thank you.

270
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,610
I was just joking.

271
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,440
What? What was?

272
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,010
What I said earlier that I have
'un-face-recognizitis'.

273
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,310
It was too crowded, so I couldn't see well.

274
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,980
If your slow replies make me mad,
your explanation is even more so.

275
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,920
Am I so inconspicuous in a crowd?

276
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,860
Those passing men were all
stealing glances at me.

277
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,430
But yet the boyfriend can't see a thing.

278
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,000
This hurts my pride.

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,340
If I am so inconspicuous in a crowd,
why are you dating me?

281
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,110
Must think again? 
Then forget it. Forget it.

282
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,510
Can we just not watch the movie?

283
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,610
Huh?

284
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,080
I suddenly don't wish to watch the movie.

285
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,280
Let's go to the suburbs and enjoy the breeze.

286
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,490
But we have even bought the tickets.

287
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,690
Just returning it will do.

288
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,990
I want to see this movie.

289
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,930
I don't want to see. Let's just go.

290
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,130
I see. Go outside, I guess.

291
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,070
Good. Let's just...

292
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,840
Sorry. Su Yeong, you go to the suburbs now,

293
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,040
and call me later about where you are.

294
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,240
Once the movie ends, I will come over there.

295
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,440
What?

296
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,890
You're here?

297
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,450
You're playing NarARa Superboard again?
(Korean animation, circa 1992)

298
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,120
Because Son O Gong monkey king is 
back to normal from being an idiot.

299
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,060
I'm going. Min Hyeok, see you tomorrow.

300
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,830
I've heard this song so much 
that I've memorized it too.

301
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,110
Mom. But, why hasn't Jun Hyeok
come even once?

302
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Can't you bring Jun Hyeok here too?

303
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,220
One can drink directly from this, right?

304
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,160
Our boss is extremely sensitive.

305
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,090
It's a triple filter product,
so feel free to use it like that.

306
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,930
I am all done.

307
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,860
So we'll meet in 2 months again.

308
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,170
And Oh... Do you know this
Min Dong building nearby?

309
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,000
<i>That place is a bit complicated.</i>

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,840
<i>I'll come out and give you the directions.</i>

311
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,670
<i>Thank you.</i>

312
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,820
Nice. Youngster, you are home?

313
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,030
Yes. Need to use the bathroom?

314
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,450
No. I just came.

315
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Why is the house so quiet?

316
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,800
You're alone?

317
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,530
Yes.

318
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,940
One never knows of this world, right?

319
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,240
When we kept fighting at my house, 
who would've thought we'd meet here?

320
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,540
What past life connection is
bringing us back together?

321
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,380
Were we a family?

322
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,850
So amazing.

323
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,250
The test results are still not out,
so you must be all alone and bored.

324
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,720
No, I'm not. Not particularly.

325
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,820
I'm also bored.

326
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,290
Shall we do something?

327
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,760
Huh? Do what?

328
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,590
I have to go to the supermarket to 
buy a dishwashing brush.

329
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,690
Do you want to come?

330
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,890
Dishwashing brush?

331
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,350
<i>Heartbreak City, Seoul.</i>

332
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,750
<i>But still, it's beautiful. 
I didn't know that.</i>

333
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,050
<i>Is the river so big?</i>

334
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,260
<i>Quite impressive.</i>

335
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,840
For me to eat?

336
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,940
What's this?

337
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,240
- Carp bread.
- Carp bread?

338
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,080
<i>Carp is a fish.</i>

339
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,910
<i>It's seafood!</i>

340
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:50,480
<i>Bread made using fish?</i>
(Bungeoppang is a pastry. Only shaped as a fish)

341
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,990
What is this? The guts of a fish?

342
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,820
It's red bean. Red bean.

343
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,020
Red bean?

344
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,260
<i>It's crispy on the outside and 
sticky-fragrant inside.</i>

345
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,570
<i>Something so amazing and tasty exists?</i>

346
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,770
How much is this bread?

347
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,970
300 Wons.
(US$ 0.25)

348
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,810
4 for 1000 Wons.
(US$ 0.80)

349
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,910
What?

350
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,740
Such a treat and it's just 1000 for 4?

351
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,310
Unbelievable!

352
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,620
May I ask what your name is?

353
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,550
I'm Gim Tae Hui.

354
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,850
<i>Say it once again.</i>

355
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,060
<i>Tae Hui.</i>

356
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,360
<i>- You mean... 
- Gim Tae Hui.</i>

357
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,040
Aigoo.
(Aigoo - Oh dear, Oh my god)

358
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,850
The weather is great. Isn't it?

359
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,950
Yes, I guess...

360
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,520
What is that?

361
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,090
Shall we go there to take a look?

362
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,290
Where to?

363
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,840
This is for memories. Put one on.

364
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,140
Earlier we had the bear paw game
and the cola soda game.

365
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,640
Looking back later, we will really 
have a ton of memories. Won't we?

366
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,480
Yes.

367
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,490
What is this?

368
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,360
I was walking on the street with the youngster.

369
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,030
I... open-quotes... pat the lad's shoulder
close-quotes... and say.

370
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,340
Shall we bet on who reaches the tree first?

371
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,070
<i>Youngster...</i>

372
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,370
<i>Shall we bet on who reaches the tree first?</i>

373
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,110
What?

374
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,310
<i>What? You don't think I'm a rival to you?</i>

375
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,880
<i>Not so, my friend! 
My old nickname is cheetah.</i>

376
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,820
<i>It's true. Want to try?</i>

377
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,380
<i>Get set...</i>

378
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,850
<i>Go!</i>

379
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,190
At the tree, the youngster and I
lay down panting, on the lawn.

380
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,030
I felt a sense of closeness.

381
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,960
I... open-quotes 
ruffle his hairs. close-quotes.

382
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:29,240
I never had a son, and always
wanted a son like you.

383
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,480
<i>If you weren't a son from a rich family
but my son, I would have no regrets.</i>

384
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:43,560
<i>Even in that small house, when you were eating
and sleeping like a son, those days were so nice!</i>

385
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,330
<i>If you are truly a son of that family, 
you will forget us, right?</i>

386
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,260
<i>It's not possible for it to be true.</i>

387
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,770
<i>Saying that it's not possible is like saying
that you will forget us if it is. Right?</i>

388
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,600
<i>Am I not right?</i>

389
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,950
<i>Wonder why people always change?</i>

390
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,620
<i>How nice would it be if nobody changed?</i>

391
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,650
<i>The youngster... open-quotes
looked softly at me, close-quotes.</i>

392
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,420
Like that Ajumma and Mom there, I will also look
after you well if you are a real son of that family.

393
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,530
Really?

394
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,260
Yes.

395
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,090
Then, shall we see some proof?

396
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,770
If you are truly a son, can you
lend me 50 million Wons?
(~US$ 45,000)

397
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,070
Has this Mom lost all her senses?

398
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,840
Why are you walking so fast
without saying anything?

399
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,980
I need to run, to catch up with you.

400
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,180
Why do you think I am like this?

401
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,280
Huh?

402
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,120
Well, that...

403
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,950
You have something urgent to do?

404
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,150
I'm going to pass away from suffocation!

405
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,820
When you see a woman like this, you don't get
the feeling that may be she is angry?

406
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,660
How can a man turn out to be this dull?

407
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,760
Hold this first.

408
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,600
Look here!

409
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,840
Why is your shoelaces always loose?
It's dangerous.

410
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,510
It was loose sometime back also,
when you came to see me.

411
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,180
Su Yeong, after you left I kept feeling bad.

412
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,580
Might you have fallen down?
Might you be hurt badly?

413
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,880
I kept thinking of only that.

414
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,660
Didn't that mean I liked you?

415
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,860
That's why I said we would date.

416
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,690
All of a sudden... what's this you're...

417
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,160
Didn't you ask me,

418
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,100
why I said we would date?

419
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,770
What I asked earlier before seeing the movie... 
It's now that you answer it?

420
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,600
It was an important question, I felt.

421
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,910
So I had to think for quite some time.

422
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,780
Mr. Jang Yul. You know you are
a really weird guy, right?

423
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,550
Fine, I guess. You were such a man
right from the start.

424
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,120
Let's go to eat something.

425
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,560
Was that effective?

426
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,660
What's this about, damn it?

427
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,970
You want the 50 million so badly
as to deceive others?

428
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,800
Hey, wait. You're looking at 
somebody else's diary?

429
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,530
Geez.

430
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,840
Reading such things written in a diary
is a first for me!

431
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,040
So annoying, seriously.

432
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,910
Go to Sindangdong and get some fired rice cakes.

433
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,750
Why do you ask for Sindangdong fried rice cakes
all of a sudden?

434
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,250
Suddenly I am craving for Sindangdong fried rice
cakes, that's why. Go and get it. Hurry. Hurry.

435
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,090
What are you doing?

436
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,370
- He's cool.
- He's way too cool.

437
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,300
Not one we see too often.

438
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,710
Hi.

439
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,640
It's just you alone who came?

440
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,840
Huh? Yes.

441
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,410
You're able to speak Korean?

442
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,510
Just a little.

443
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,080
Not too long since I learned it,
so don't I sound too foolish?

444
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,190
My pronunciation is weird too.

445
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,390
No, you do it extremely well.

446
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,220
- You are cute.
- You are cool.

447
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,320
Me?

448
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,260
Being a foreigner,
I may be like a big stupid nailhead.

449
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,730
You find me cool?

450
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,560
Big stupid nailhead?

451
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,230
You are no stupid nailhead.
You are fabulously cool!

452
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,170
- You're so cute.
- So damn cool.

453
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,840
<i>Seoul women would all be like Su Yeong, 
and dislike me, I thought.</i>

454
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,310
<i>They say it's not so?</i>

455
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,240
<i>And on top, they are damn pretty too!</i>

456
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,350
<i>Oh my!</i>

457
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,750
If you have time, you want to
have some fun together?

458
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,820
Great, then. I have all kinds of time.

459
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,230
Seoul is a highly bewitching city.

460
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,060
No. Not yet.

461
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,630
Does it make sense that you still haven't even
gone into that room?

462
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,570
What did you do all night? 
Pulling crazy crap!

463
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,240
Find it fast, damnit! In 2 days the results
come out and it's over, blockhead!

464
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,070
Blockhead?

465
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:30,580
Okay, sorry about 'blockhead', find it quickly,
we have no time, my... dear friend!

466
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,460
Is there something that you need?

467
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,660
No.

468
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,100
<i>Hongberg,</i>

469
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,040
<i>It's dark, I'm scaredy-scared.</i>

470
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,610
<i>Can you pretty-please pick me up
from the bus-stop? </i>

471
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,550
Did this girl eat something wrong?

472
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,720
What are you doing here?

473
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,660
What else can I be doing? 
You asked me to pick you up.

474
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,900
Damn her... That's why she asked
me to get her fried rice cakes?

475
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,630
This ajumma is seriously...

476
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,100
What about an ajumma?

477
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,400
Nothing at all. Want to eat fried rice cake?

478
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,070
Tasty, no?

479
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,280
I come here every time after practice ends.

480
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,380
Yes, it's sure tasty.

481
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,210
The soup is the best.

482
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,410
Drink and see.

483
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,590
Hold on a bit.

484
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,770
Where are you going?

485
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,800
Going to the washroom?

486
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,710
What's this?

487
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,920
Open and see.

488
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,830
Do you like it?

489
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,760
No need to feel obligated.

490
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,330
Just like you worried seeing my shoelaces,

491
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,900
it affected me too, when I saw your shoes.

492
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,470
The sole would drop off, I felt.

493
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,810
I'm going.

494
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,640
Take care.

495
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,790
What has gotten into this ajumma?

496
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:08,400
<i>I tried my best to beautify it.</i>

497
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,170
<i>When you both intimately eat fried rice cakes,
find a way to bite him, I beg you!</i>

498
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,280
I have to head this way.

499
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,750
Take care.

500
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,590
Huh?

501
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,160
Fine.

502
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,860
No matter how late you are for practice, 
shouldn't you still send me home? Geez!

503
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,440
That's not what I meant. 
The receipt, please.

504
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,180
Huh?

505
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,480
Didn't you ask me earlier
if I liked the shoes?

506
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,320
Honestly, I don't quite like it.

507
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,350
Give me the receipt, for me to exchange it...

508
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,330
Let me get up first.

509
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,820
The news said the power station malfunctioned.
It seems the power is gone.

510
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,870
It has to be somewhere here.

511
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,540
Where is it?

512
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,040
Me, it's me.

513
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,240
Hongberg!

514
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,180
I just knew that you'd be like this.

515
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,690
Seems like the power is down for
the whole neighborhood.

516
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,390
Oh, I'm saved!

517
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,800
Can you be here by yourself like this?

518
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,530
I have some matters to do.

519
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,370
Oh, go on.

520
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,620
Why haven't you gone?

521
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,290
I will stay till the power comes back.

522
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,260
The candles look lovely.

523
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:35,230
50 million Wons was blinding my mom
when she bought them, just recently.

524
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,700
Huh?

525
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,580
My mother wants me to entice you 
before you turn into a rich family son.

526
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,510
The text message sent earlier 
was also my mom's doing.

527
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:49,550
But don't worry. I have no plans to entice you.

528
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,850
If I'm a man, a housefly is a bird, you said!

529
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,790
Remembering useless words!

530
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,830
Not that a housefly is indeed a bird...

531
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:07,170
but I would just... hope we can continue like this.

532
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:16,340
If you can come over like now 
as if nothing had happened...

533
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,750
and stay by my side as if nothing has happened,
that will be nice.

534
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,150
In other words, even if you were to be
a 2nd generation rich family guy...

535
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,350
Nevermind.

536
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,760
If you become a 2nd generation rich family guy,
things will completely change.

537
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,160
No chance it happens.

538
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,460
Still, by chance if it does?

539
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,770
Even then we'll be friends, right?

540
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,760
By chance if you are that real son,
then treat me to some good beef!

541
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,740
Rib-eye steak. I haven't had it even once.

542
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,940
Promise?

543
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,920
And also, in case...

544
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,590
Even if you've really become that family's son, 
please don't lend my mom 50 million Wons.

545
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,520
That's why I deliberately 
talked about 50 million Wons.

546
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,130
If you are to do that, I will be 
too embarrassed to look at you.

547
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,700
Understand?

548
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:28,650
Just wait a little bit more. For all you know,
it may be possible to get 50 million dollars.

549
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,050
How many pyeongs is the floor space?
(Pyeong = 3.3 sq.meters)

550
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,310
-=Next Episode Preview=-

551
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,850
- No Bo Yeong!
- Seonbae.
(seonbae - senior, mentor)

552
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,770
The first time one falls in love,
is there anything but kissing?

553
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,810
Was I the only one like that?

554
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,760
Isn't this a crime?

555
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,190
DNA result will be out tomorrow. 
What to do?

556
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,790
Let's return to our teenage years
after a long time!

557
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,940
In that trip, I only remember
kissing the entire day.

558
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,080
Son of a bitch.

559
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,970
If you are the real son, you know you have to
buy me rib-eye steaks, right?

560
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,760
That bastard.

561
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,310
Hey, you punk!

562
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,790
Why are you here only now?
I wanted so much to see you.

563
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,910
I'm also unsure...

564
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,060
what, how and which direction it should be.
