2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,380
Well then,

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,930
why don't I make a deal with you?

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,800
Aren't you looking for your friends?

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,500
Tell me his name and what he looks like.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,200
If you promise me that you'll stay, then I'll look for your friends.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,800
I don't have friends.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,200
Were you abandoned by your friends?

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,500
I'll give you one more chance.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,650
Think about it carefully.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,400
I am very angry this time, extremely angry.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,400
You know how I treat you usually.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,800
You dare to do this to me?!

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,380
What was your name?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,450
Ah Chang.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,100
Ah Chang?

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
- Throw him to the ocean for the fishes.<br>- Yes!

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
- If you have any problem, deal with me! Let him go!<br>- Boss Sakai...

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,000
- What capability will you show for killing him?!<br>- Boss! Boss! Have mercy!

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,400
- You can't even defend yourself.<br>- Boss!

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
- Bring her away.<br>- Yes.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,800
- Let me go. <br> - Move.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,500
Let me go!

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,700
Being angry everyday is not good for my skin.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,800
<i>I'm betting small. Big. Small.</i>

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,800
- Big, big, big.<br>- Small, small.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,060
Here, here, here.

28
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,000
<i>I don't believe that I'm unlucky. I don't believe.</i>

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,630
<i>I'll still buy small.</i>

30
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,600
<i>I'll bet big. Small. Big. Small.</i>

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,400
Move aside. Move aside. How do you play this?

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Is this your first time to play?

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Between this big and small, you just bet randomly.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
- Bet randomly, is that it?<br>- Right, bet randomly.

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,300
I'm betting on big.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,400
- I'll bet on small. <br>- Betting on small.

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,900
- Small! Small!<br>- Big! Big!

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,700
- Big! Big! Big!<br>- Small!

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,800
I won! I won!

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Boss, I'm betting on big again.

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,600
I'll also bet on big! I'll also bet on big!

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,400
Big! Big! Big!

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
- You're something!<br>- I won again!

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,000
Your luck is not bad.

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
I can't play anymore. I can't play anymore.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,410
- I'm going now. I'm going now.<br>- Mister, just play one more round.

47
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,700
- Just one round.<br>- Right, one more round.

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,400
Just play one more round.

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,450
Come. Come. Come.

50
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,500
Play one more round.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,600
- Play one more round. This is fun.<br>- Come. Come. Come.

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,300
Just play one more round, okay?

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,840
Okay. I'll bet all on big! Bet on big!

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,700
Okay. Big! Big! I'll bet on big, too.

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,000
- Big! Big! Big!<br>- Small! Small!

56
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,380
<i>Xiong Fei, Yuan Shuai, I'm risking your life on this bet.</i>

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,300
<i>You two must bless me that I can win this.</i>

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,400
Sorry. Sorry.

59
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,000
You can't. You can't. Go now. Go now.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
Why must I enter the gambling area?

61
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,300
Why?!

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,490
I don't have any money now.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,370
How am I supposed to save Xiong Fei?

64
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,300
How am I supposed to save Yuan Shuai?

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,300
Stop right there.

66
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
I...

67
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,330
You don't need to tell me where you went.

68
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,200
I don't want to mind your business.

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,700
Go and split the logs in the backyard first,

70
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,850
wash the bowls in the kitchen,

71
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,600
wash the vegetables, wash the clothes, and sweep the floor.

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,900
Or else, you won't have any food to eat.

73
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,500
Okay.

74
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,500
You don't know at all how tiring it was to bring you up from when we were little!

75
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,400
- You...<br>- What about me?

76
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,800
I am the one who is tired!

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,400
You crappy person.

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,600
You totally are a big asshole!

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
You are the one who is a bastard.

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,300
My biggest mistake in this lifetime is to meet you!

81
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,700
Crappy person, look at my 'fierce tiger going down the mountain'!

82
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
Look at me hitting you!

83
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm also hitting you!

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,700
I'll punch you!

85
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,100
What are you two doing?! What are you two doing?!

86
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,350
Stop! Don't fight anymore!

87
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,800
Stop fighting already!

88
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,200
Enough already. Unlock the chains first.

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Da He.

90
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,190
Let's go, Da He.

91
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,800
No use. We won't be able to get out.

92
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,370
How will we know if we don't give it a try?

93
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,800
Let's go.

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,800
- Older Bro Fei.<br>- Are everyone okay now? Let's go now, everyone.

95
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,700
Come with me!

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,500
Bastard! Planning to rebel?!

97
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
What are you two planning to do?

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
You tell us what we are going to do.

99
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,300
Dead fatty, you better release us now.

100
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,980
I hate other people calling me a fatty the most.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,330
You even added a 'dead' word in front?!

102
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,200
I'll kick you to death!

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,670
I just want to call you that. So what? So what?

104
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,800
Dead fatty! Dead fatty! Dead fatty!

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,200
Let me tell you. Today, we all must escape out of this damn place.

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,790
Do you think you can get out just because you want to?

107
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm the law in here.

108
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,560
The two of them are newbies and don't know any better.

109
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,800
It's fine for them causing trouble.

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,420
But all you others know the rules.

111
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,800
Yet you all are still creating a disturbance here?!

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,600
Let me tell you all. I'm counting to 5.

113
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,100
If you don't go back, you know the consequences.

114
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,300
Are you even counting? Do you think we are kids?

115
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,400
Will we just be scared because of that?

116
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,000
Scaring you?

117
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,630
Just look.

118
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,200
I'm counting now.

119
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,500
5!

120
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,800
Hey, don't be afraid. As long as we unite, we surely can get out of here.

121
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
4!

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,640
Da He, you are their leader.

124
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,200
You must not retreat.

125
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,600
It's no use. We can't get out.

126
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
3!

127
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Da He!

128
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,490
We have more people than them.

129
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,600
- What really are you being afraid about?<br>- That's right.

130
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
2!

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,390
Da He! Da He!

132
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,500
- You all...<br>- Da He...

133
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,600
Don't go!

134
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,970
Restrain them!

135
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,300
Yes!

136
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,400
Customer, your hooves are here.

137
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,180
Is it my hooves or the pork's hooves?

138
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,100
This is your hooves.

139
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,800
T-T-This is the pork hooves.

140
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Don't laugh anymore! Don't laugh anymore!

141
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,200
Boss! What kind of waiter is this that you hired?

142
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,030
What my hooves, the pork's hooves.

143
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,400
He can't even differentiate my hooves and the pork hooves.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,700
<i>What are you doing?</i>

145
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,100
<i>- Stop right there! Stop right there!<br>- Star Chart.</i>

146
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,800
<i>Stop right there! Stop right there!</i>

147
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,500
- What are you doing?!<br>- Give me back my item.

148
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,330
What item? How come I don't know?

149
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,400
Don't you dare try to scare me.

150
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Stop pretending already!

151
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,020
Last time, you stole my Star Chart.

152
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,000
If you don't give it to me today, don't think of leaving.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,400
- You really can't understand.<br>- Hey!

154
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
- Boss.<br>- Where are you going?

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
My stuff got stolen. I am trying to get it back.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,980
You are being paid wages by me so you are my people.

157
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,800
Without my permission, don't think of going anywhere.

158
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,600
- Boss, that item is really very important to me.<br>- I'm warning you.

159
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,200
My patience has a limit. Stop trying each time to challenge it.

160
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,800
I don't care.

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
<i>Get in! Get in! Behave!</i>

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,600
<i>You two better behave! Do you hear me?</i>

163
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,300
You dead fatty who has no conscience! Dirty thing! Stinky evil person!

164
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,400
Hurry and let us out!

165
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,760
Then just continue your cursing.

166
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,300
The fiercer it is, the better.

167
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,370
Let me tell you. Don't just look at how happily you can still jump now.

168
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,000
In the future, I'll put you to death.

169
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,600
An attempt where you already know the result, what's there to be angry about?

170
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,550
Such a coward.

171
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,800
Escaping in the middle of the fight.

172
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,860
The door was just right there.

173
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,800
We clearly could have gone out.

174
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,000
People like you are indeed suitable to stay here forever.

175
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,420
- What did you say?<br>- What are you doing?

176
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,150
What are you doing?!

177
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,700
What?

178
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,410
Want to kill me?

179
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,430
Come. Give me a fast one.

180
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,110
It's better than staying in corruption with you to kill one another as monkeys played by others.

181
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,930
If you ask me,

182
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,380
the ones lock you in here aren't these shackles

183
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,580
or these cages,

184
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,750
but your own selves.

185
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,920
You yourselves have no more courage or hope.

186
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,400
Just continue dragging out an ignoble existence.

187
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,420
Why must Older Bro Fei and I still turn around and save you all?

188
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,530
We could have just escaped by our own.

189
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,370
But we wanted that all of you here

190
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,920
to live a humane life.

191
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,010
Yet in the end,

192
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,260
in the end...

193
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,590
Customer, please wait.

194
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,370
Hey.

195
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,800
Come. This one is good.

196
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,480
Boss, you tell me, is there any money lending bank at this place?

197
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:17,560
In this small place, how can there be a money lending bank?

198
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,080
Slower.

199
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,270
There isn't even a bank, is there?

200
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,580
None.

201
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,880
Here.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,350
Buddy, are you a foreigner?

203
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,810
What?

204
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,580
I have a precious item here. Do you want it?

205
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,640
What treasure?

206
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,200
Blue-and-white porcelain.

207
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,240
Blue-and-white porcelain?

208
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,280
Do I look like a person who can afford to buy blue-and-white porcelain?

209
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,370
Buddy, just look at it for a while.

210
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,040
This is my family's heirloom.

211
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,120
If not because I need money right away, I won't be rushing to sell this.

212
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,770
There was even such a kind of treasure on this small island.

213
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,400
If this is in the capital,

214
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,160
I might have already bought it.

215
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,220
But I have no money now.

216
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,140
Buddy, you really have good eyes.

217
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,740
This one is worth 2,000 liang.

218
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm just selling it now for 100 liang.

219
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
If you are going to resell it, you can at least sell it for 500 liang.

220
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,190
Don't you even want this? You really are so stupid.

221
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,170
<i>If I resell that vase,</i>

222
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,360
<i>won't the money I earn be able to save Yuan Shuai and the others?</i>

223
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,680
Hey! Wait!

224
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,310
Ha?

225
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,640
I'll get this item now. Wait for me. I'll just get some money.

226
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,290
Sure. The treasure won't wait for you.

227
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,550
Hurry and go.

228
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,770
My fishes are over there.

229
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,970
You wait for me there.

230
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,860
Okay.

231
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,650
I want to advance my wage.

232
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,070
Do you think I will give it to you?

233
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,840
Today, you must give it no matter what.

234
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,700
Then what you are doing is stealing then.

235
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,240
That's right.

236
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,100
Give me the money!

237
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,300
On what basis should I give it to you?

238
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,890
I'll exchange it for an item.

239
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,430
You already are this poor.

240
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,180
What item can you still have to give me in exchange?

241
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,310
Is this one okay?

242
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,690
If this hand can save the lives of my two buddies,

243
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,040
I'll cut it off for you!

244
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,020
Fine. Anyway, my knife has not seen blood for quite a long time already.

245
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,510
Take it to save your friends.

246
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,610
Thanks.

247
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,540
Hey.

248
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,340
Little bro, why did you come just now? I even thought you were not coming anymore.

249
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,310
Of course, I would come.

250
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,460
Where is the money?

251
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,720
The money is here.

252
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,480
- Give me the money.<br>- Wait.

253
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,510
Let me see the vase first.

254
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,710
Give me the money first.

255
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,880
Let me see the vase first. What if when I was gone, you switched the item?

256
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,490
I was pushing your fishes so how could I have the time to change the item?

257
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,400
Then how about this? Let's exchange it at the same time.

258
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,130
Okay.

259
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,590
Hey, oh right. All sales are final. No returns.

260
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,020
Right, it's real.

261
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,820
Okay. I'm going now.

262
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,860
Where can I go to sell this?

263
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,160
Are you still awake?

264
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,670
I can't sleep.

265
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,830
What are you thinking then?

266
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,290
I don't know, either.

267
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,360
Random thoughts.

268
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:03,790
Thinking that there are still so many things I haven't finished.

269
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,150
So many people I haven't thanked.

270
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,320
Then just think about him in your heart.

271
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,610
Think about who you want to say sorry to.

272
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,540
Who you want to thank.

273
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,170
Thinking about him in your heart.

274
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,280
They will then dream about you.

275
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,170
Sleep now.

276
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,100
Older Bro Fei,

277
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,700
being your friend is my most non-regrettable matter in this life.

278
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,370
Although we never said any stupid words like living and dying together,

279
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,550
if there is a next life time,

280
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,060
I would still want to be your buddy.

281
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,840
What nonsense are you talking about? Sleep now.

282
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,550
Look at it. How much will this item be worth?

283
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,020
Where did you get this item?

284
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,420
Don't bother where I got it.

285
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,220
Just see if it can be worth how much.

286
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,000
We are not allowed to accept

287
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,040
items whose origin is doubtful.

288
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,250
Don't worry.

289
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,920
This item is definitely mine.

290
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,590
It's just that I'm in a hurry to have some money to use now

291
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,070
so I can sell it to you at a lower price.

292
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,310
1,000 liang? How about it?

293
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,160
Okay! Deal!

294
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,890
- Servant.<br>- Yes, Master.

295
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,340
Get the money and give it to him.

296
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,880
Yes.

297
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,660
I found you two a playmate.

298
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,490
He will play with you two tomorrow.

299
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,090
Little thing...

300
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,140
Be careful.

301
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,320
Brats, I'll torment you two to death.

302
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,630
Da He.

303
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,490
Da He.

304
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,480
Looking at you doing this thing all day but not doing it well,

305
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,140
I made you one.

306
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,650
Treat it as my payment for that bread.

307
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,850
Forget it.

308
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,720
I also don't know what I want to say.

309
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,990
Maybe it's some last words.

310
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,330
If one day, you meet people who are looking for us,

311
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,850
just tell them that Zhan Xiong Fei and Yuan Shuai found a treasure

312
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,560
and went to a very far, far away place to open a restaurant.

313
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,590
And that place is someplace that no one knows about.

314
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,300
I know that you are a good person.

315
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,240
Please then.

316
KoreanDramaX.co

317
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,850
Wake up.

318
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,000
Wake up, young man!

319
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,290
Who are you people? Let go of me!

320
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,470
Let go!

321
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,940
Don't move.

322
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,100
Are you some racketeering shop?

323
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,010
Are you planning to steal from me?!

324
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,530
Steal?

325
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,130
Do you know what this is?

326
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,220
Blue-and-white porcelain.

327
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,490
Do you know whose item this is?

328
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,590
Of course, it's mine.

329
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,570
Stealing an item from my, Qiu Luo Feng's, house,

330
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,230
you even dared to publicly sell it on the streets

331
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,430
and even dared to claim it as yours?

332
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,490
You really have guts.

333
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,880
I don't know that this item was stolen from your house.

334
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,630
But I spent money to buy this.

335
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,160
Do you think I will believe you?

336
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,660
Believing or not is your problem.

337
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,340
Why have you tied me up?

338
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,130
Are you going to kill me?

339
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,870
Do you want to die that much?

340
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,450
I don't want to die.

341
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,870
My friends were sold to the fighting arena.

342
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,880
They are even waiting for me to save them.

343
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,440
Then does it mean

344
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,910
that you stole this vase and planned to sell it to get money to save your friends?

345
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,350
I am saying it again.

346
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,660
I borrowed money to buy that thing! I didn't steal it!

347
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,960
How about this?

348
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,520
I'll make a deal with you.

349
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,530
Since this vase has already returned to your hands,

350
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,730
just let me go and lend me money.

351
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,040
After I saved my friends, I'll pay you back.

352
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,950
Okay?

353
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,520
If all of this that you are saying is true,

354
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,460
you are quite a loyal friend.

355
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,320
I admire you.

356
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,850
Untie him.

357
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,940
I'll temporarily believe you this time.

358
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,730
What do you mean?

359
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,060
Take this and save your friends.

360
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,930
Thank you.

361
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,440
I will definitely pay you back.

362
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,460
No need.

363
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,650
Just after 2 hours, this money will return to my hands again.

364
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,590
Move aside! Move aside!

365
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,860
Move aside!

366
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,300
This isn't Xiong Fei...

367
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,990
Hey, where are my friends?

368
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,070
This person has been with me for ten years.

369
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,860
Look at what he looks now.

370
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,400
If anything happens to him,

371
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,980
do you know how hurt my heart will feel?

372
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,880
Hey. What does your friend's business have to do with me?

373
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,450
What does his life or death got to do with me?

374
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,660
He was beaten up by your friends.

375
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,720
I told you before.

376
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,230
I am a businessman. Yes.

377
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,010
You gave me that money.

378
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,820
But that money is not the bail money for your friends anymore.

379
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,640
Instead, it's payment for my losses.

380
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,250
How come you are such a dishonest man?!

381
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,940
Even if that money was still your friends' bail money,

382
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,970
he ended up like this because your friends beat him up.

383
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,230
Someone must pay, right?

384
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,550
Not much.

385
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,850
5,000 liang.

386
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,070
Why don't you just go steal?

387
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,010
I am a businessman.

388
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,490
How can I do such barbaric things?

389
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,390
You--

390
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,900
Oh, right.

391
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,970
I still have to watch the game later.

392
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,300
Jeez, this competition is quite exciting.

393
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,570
Oh, right.

394
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,900
I am exactly going to watch how those two friends of yours

395
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,690
are going to die.

396
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,630
You dead fatty! You are not a man of your words!

397
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,340
Drive him out!

398
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,040
You dead fatty! How come you aren't true to your words?! Hey!

399
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,830
- Move!<br>- If you want to make a bet, I will welcome it.

400
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,070
If you want to cause trouble, no way! Throw him out!

401
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,720
- Yes! Move!<br>- You dead fatty!

402
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,700
You dishonest dead fatty!

403
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,850
Hurry and leave! Hurry and leave!

404
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,090
- Let me in!<br>- You don't have money so why are you still coming here?! Hurry and go!

405
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,590
Hey, Mister Feng. Give me the money.

406
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,390
Looking at this money bag, this must belong to Mister Feng.

407
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,760
Mister Six told me to return it to you untouched.

408
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,840
Let's go.

409
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,820
Wasn't I right?

410
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,200
I just knew it. You are with them.

411
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,810
I disdain having dealings with them.

412
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,730
- Hey!<br>- Yes.

413
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,910
Can you help me?

414
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,260
What?

415
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,460
Do you want me to help them fight?

416
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,570
I don't mean it that way.

417
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,080
If you can help my friends,

418
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,980
I will do anything you want.

419
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,330
Do you think I need your help for me do things?

420
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,650
Don't forget.

421
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,950
It was you who stole my item.

422
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,310
I not only didn't kill you,

423
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,520
I even gave you money to save your friends.

424
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,670
I can be said to have extreme benevolence and have done my utmost duty already.

425
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,240
I know that you are a good man.

426
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,910
You are not the same with them.

427
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,500
Then can you just be a good man until the very end?

428
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,040
What you are doing is called asking for a mile when you are already given an inch.

429
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,600
I do want to help them.

430
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,610
But this world has its rules.

431
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,110
There was one really good saying.

432
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,260
If one person never lost anything,

433
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,170
then he wouldn't know how it was to truly live.

434
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,700
- Hey!<br>- I'm urging you to stop following me.

435
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,240
If I was you, I'd go back to my friends' side now.

436
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,630
At least before they die, I would still be able to send them off.

437
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,370
<i>What is this that I am doing?</i>

438
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,560
<i>Even if in death, I must die with my comrades.</i>

439
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,020
Today will be a very exciting and outstanding fight!

440
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,440
I believe that last time, everyone still remembered

441
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,050
that because of our power king belittling his opponents too much,

442
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,230
causing these two mice to have a chance to find loopholes.

443
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,530
But today, the power king has said that he surely will aim for redemption.

444
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,320
Letting these two people know what powerful really means.

445
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,720
Everyone, let's use our most warm applause and shouts

446
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,290
to cheer for this fight!

447
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,250
Someone! Anyone!

448
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,330
My stomach aches!

449
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,500
- Anyone!<br>- What's going on?

450
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,940
What's going on?

451
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,020
My stomach is aching.

452
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,260
What's going on?

453
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,260
- It really hurts a lot.<br>- Come. Get out. Stand up.

454
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,950
So painful.

455
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,140
Come.

456
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,890
You must have eaten too much.

457
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,630
So painful...

458
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,530
So heavy.

459
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,600
Can everyone here the sound at the viewing stadium?

460
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,890
Is the moment of our death just to try to please these cold, heartless, and inhumane audiences?!

461
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,240
What that little buddy said is right.

462
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,060
What is really imprisoning us?

463
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,020
Is it this cage?

464
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,110
No. It is ourselves.

465
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,260
Who made us become cowards?

466
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,630
And who made us lose courage?

467
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,230
Right now, I want to go out. Live like a human.

468
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,790
Who is willing to come with me?!

469
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,490
I'm going! I'm going!

470
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,530
Me! Count me in! I'm going!

471
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,330
Count me in! I'm going with you! Let's go out together!

472
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,850
Buddies! Come with me!

473
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,130
Let us go! Go!

474
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,740
Go and open the doors.

475
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,890
Hurry. This way.

476
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:44,460
Older Bro Fei, Older Bro Fei, my 'fierce tiger going down the mountain' won't work this time.

477
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,990
No matter if it will work or not, let's just try it. Come.

478
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,290
Fierce tiger going down the mountain!

479
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,580
Hit him. Hit him.

480
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,550
Today, I will knead you two to death!

481
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,820
The battle starts!

482
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,130
Don't be afraid. If we are going to die, I'll die before you.

483
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,210
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.

484
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,300
Stop them!

485
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,370
Buddies, attack!

486
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,570
What's going on? What's going on?

487
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,670
Who are we fighting now?

488
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,070
Da He?

489
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,490
Da He, you've changed your mind, right?

490
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,470
You said it right. Even if we are going to die here, we have to die with courage.

491
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,150
Let's go. I'll protect and escort you out of here.

492
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,730
- Let's go together! Go!<br>- Okay!

493
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,800
Buddies! Let's go!

494
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,430
Are you all rebelling?!

495
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,240
Go in quickly.

496
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,970
They are fighting already! Hurry and run!

497
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,740
Run! Hurry and run!

498
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,980
Quickly go! Hurry and run!

499
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,020
Hurry and run!

500
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,500
Go!

501
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,430
Xiong Fei!

502
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,670
Zhan Xiong Fei!

503
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,600
Yuan Shuai!

504
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,560
Xiong Fei!

505
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,250
Where have you gone to?

506
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,910
Later, if Zi Su starts asking about it,

507
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,720
tell her that I've already informed you.

508
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,550
It's just that you've forgotten about it. Understand?

509
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,500
I remember already, Your Majesty.

510
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,560
What if Zi Su doesn't believe?

511
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,030
Do you still have any other way?

512
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:17,530
Your Majesty, if even you can't handle Princess Zi Su,

513
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,860
who else in this world can?

514
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,570
Reporting!

515
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,680
- Your Majesty, I have urgent news to report.<br>- What is it? Why are you in a flurry?

516
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,830
We just received information that the royal tomb has been looted.

517
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,670
What?! Who did it?

518
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,360
Still don't know.

519
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,700
- Okay. Go back to the grand hall first.<br>- Yes.

520
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:55,000
Pi Wu, you had a major achievement this time.

521
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,670
Just for Lord of the City, I am willing to offer my life.

522
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,550
Fine.

523
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,890
Once I use the Magic Star to

524
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,980
summon the magical army that the God of Heaven left,

525
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,490
we will let our people

526
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,760
to openly live under the sun.

527
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,550
Congratulations, Lord of the City.

528
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,690
For a hundred years, no one has accomplished this great cause in this underground city.

529
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,230
It has been realized in your hands.

530
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,420
That's right.

531
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:39,260
This can be considered a great relief to our founders from a hundred years ago.

532
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,640
<i>Kill them! Kill...</i>

533
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,910
<i>Kill!</i>

534
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,640
<i>Retreat!</i>

535
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,380
<i>Does His Majesty really want to do this?</i>

536
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,350
<i>This concerns the lives of thousands of citizens.</i>

537
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,780
<i>Right now, the war has been going for so long. </i>

538
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,050
<i>The treasury is running out of money. We can only do such a move.</i>

539
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,740
<i>General needs only to follow the orders of His Majesty.</i>

540
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,260
<i>Afterwards, once the dynasty is stable,</i>

541
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,270
<i>General will surely be able to enjoy your achievements forever.</i>

542
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,220
<i>But how about the thousands of citizens at the downstream of the river?</i>

543
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,920
<i>This is not what you should be worrying about.</i>

544
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,740
<i>As the general in the front line, what you should think about is how to fight the battle.</i>

545
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,530
<i>Please decide as soon as possible.</i>

546
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,630
<i>Okay then.</i>

547
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,610
<i>Spread my order. Tomorrow night, destroy the dam.</i>

548
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,960
<i>Flood the enemy's camp.</i>

549
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,710
<i>Yes!</i>

550
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,390
<i>General, we had a great victory this time.</i>

551
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,340
<i>Once we return to the capital, His Majesty will surely give you tremendous rewards.</i>

552
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,110
<i>As your subordinates, we will benefit from it, too.</i>

553
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,320
<i>Shut up.</i>

554
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,440
<i>Don't you clearly know how we won this battle?</i>

555
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,910
<i>We won without fighting</i>

556
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,650
<i>and even sacrificed the lives of thousands of citizens.</i>

557
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,340
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

558
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,170
<i>You group of rebels and traitors!</i>

559
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,940
<i>Actually publicly going against the order of His Majesty!</i>

560
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,470
<i>Not giving importance to the lives of thousands of citizens!</i>

561
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,520
<i>As ordered by His Majesty, I am here to arrest you all!</i>

562
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,420
<i>Isn't this His Majesty's order?</i>

563
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,320
<i>Why did it become an order to defy the Emperor?</i>

564
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,380
<i>Attack!</i>

565
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,320
<i>Buddies, kill them to make the way!</i>

566
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,170
<i>[Xiu]</i>

567
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,410
<i>General, where are we going now?</i>

568
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,190
<i>In this world, all land belongs to the Emperor.</i>

569
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,380
<i>Where else can we go?</i>

570
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,840
<i>Are we going to wait here for them to kill us?</i>

571
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,280
<i>No. Since we have no place to settle in the above land,</i>

572
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,370
<i>but there is a place His Majesty can't control.</i>

573
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,790
<i>General, where is this place?</i>

574
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,360
<i>The underground.</i>

575
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,510
As long as I can let the people of Yongzhou City live underground,

576
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,750
I, Lord Xiu Fu, will die without any regrets.

577
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,220
Lord of the City cares about the citizens of Yongzhou in your heart.

578
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,530
No wonder you are supported and revered by the citizens.

579
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,990
There is still something extremely important.

580
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,300
That is the formula for the medicine that your teacher, the Miracle Healer, is holding.

581
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,640
When I think of this Miracle Healer, I get a headache.

582
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,340
Lord of the City, my teacher, this old fogey,

583
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,170
is very stubborn and prejudiced.

584
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,890
But please don't worry,

585
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,180
I will surely do my best

586
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,050
to fulfill this task.

587
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,040
Fine.

588
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,070
I will wait for your good news.

589
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,030
Older bro, you are still treating me like a kid.

590
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,000
Just those soldiers that you arranged to guard me,

591
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,190
how can they stop a person who has seen great winds and high waves like me?

592
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,920
Zhan Xiong Fei!

593
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,760
<i>It's the white-skin person?</i>

594
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,000
<i>Yes. White-skin person.</i>

595
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,050
Lord Ma.

596
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,250
Lord Ma, this news is worth at least two gold bars.

597
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,480
Don't be too greedy.

598
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,120
If I need anything else, I will look for you again.

599
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,640
Scram.

600
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
Zhan Xiong Fei!

601
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,450
Zhan Xiong Fei!

602
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,370
Zhan Xiong Fei!

603
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,410
Princess Zi Su?

604
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,060
Good things actually come without any reasons.

605
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,870
Zhan Xiong Fei!

606
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,290
Zhan Xiong Fei!

607
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,490
Ma Shun.

608
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,280
Greetings to Princess Zi Su.

609
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,020
Heaven has really helped me.

610
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,390
Even though I don't have a mansion,

611
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,970
I was able to capture Princess Zi Su.

612
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:53,160
With this bargaining chip, even His Majesty will have to be courteous to me.

613
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,370
Ma Shun, you have done a good job this time.

614
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,470
It was all to your guidance.

615
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,350
Is there any news about the royal tomb being looted?

616
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,350
I was just about to report to you about this.

617
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:10,360
This matter... seems like... it was done by a white-skin person.

618
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,810
I received confirmed news that

619
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,790
the Magic Star in the royal tomb was plundered by them.

620
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,890
So it was done by a white-skin person...

621
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,880
Lord, who really are these white-skin people?

622
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,570
How come they have such capability

623
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,970
to trespass a heavily guarded royal tomb and steal the Magic Star?

624
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,920
The white-skin people, also called white-face people,

625
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,900
is not just pertaining to a certain person,

626
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,050
but all the citizens who live in the underground Yongzhou City.

627
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,930
I see.

628
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,860
This is getting more interesting.

629
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,800
Lord, what you meant was...

630
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,520
Get ready to set off.

631
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,040
Lord, you shouldn't take this trouble. Better just let me go there first to check on the roads.

632
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,800
These mysterious people below Yongzhou have high skills.

633
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,520
They dared to plunder the royal tomb.

634
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,470
This shows that they don't respect the Imperial Court.

635
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,290
Even if I personally go,

636
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,180
we still might not have a 100% chance of succeeding.

637
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,080
I understand.

638
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,690
Lord, what about the Princess?

639
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,440
Take her along.

640
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,420
The princess is way more useful than a shield during emergent times.

641
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,480
Okay, I will prepare the horses and carriage now.

642
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,220
Wait.

643
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,650
Send someone to deliver a letter to the palace now.

644
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,820
Palace?

645
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,810
Who's the letter for?

646
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,020
- His Majesty. <br>- His...

647
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,950
If you didn't save us in time,

648
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,690
we would have been doomed.

649
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,550
It's nothing.

650
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,180
Why didn't you escape when we released you?

651
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,600
Subsequently, you fought your way out.

652
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,060
I don't know either.

653
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,010
It could be because of the words you said at that time.

654
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,020
The words?

655
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,830
What did I say?

656
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:56,090
You said that I should live like a human being.

657
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,540
I didn't say you were like a monkey.

658
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,870
Right now, my whole body aches.

659
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,870
Thank you for giving this to me.

660
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,610
If this grasshopper can help you find yourself again,

661
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,840
it's very meaningful then.

662
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,680
Why do you want this?

663
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,500
Because I promised someone.

664
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,820
Who is it?

665
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,390
My daughter.

666
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,070
That time, our boat capsized in this sea

667
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,800
and she fell into the water.

668
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,770
Before our boat sunk, I promised to make one for her,

669
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,400
but...

670
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,790
Your daughter... must be very adorable.

671
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,220
Of course.

672
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,070
In the past, I dared not leave.

673
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,570
I dared not remember that afternoon.

674
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,480
I didn't know where to go if I was released

675
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,420
and how I should live.

676
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,070
When I dreamed of her last night, I dared not sleep again.

677
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,960
But I realize now that

678
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,560
I should continue with my life.

679
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,810
You are right.

680
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,480
If your daughter were to see you now,

681
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,760
she would be very proud of you.

682
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,400
Little buddy, thank you.

683
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,930
If you need my help in the future, just let me know.

684
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,530
I definitely will.

685
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,190
I'm leaving.

686
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,020
Take care.

687
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,750
Take care.
