1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,223
Live for long, and I only end up
sleeping in somebody's garage...

2
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:18,826
Look what our life is...

3
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:22,730
You said it... This is like a horse-stable
of a house in the old days.

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,633
Mom, thanks to you we really
gain worldly experience.

5
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,736
Ms. Gil Seon Ja, you're the best.

6
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:31,238
Whatever you say, I am your mom,
so what can you do about it?

7
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:32,740
Just take it as your fate.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,141
Who said anything here?

9
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,944
How come it is so cold? 
You didn't turn on the hot mat?

10
00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:39,647
I did. The water in it isn't warm yet.

11
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:43,550
See, had I not redeemed at least this hot mat,
you think we could've slept in such a place?

12
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,352
It's the hot mats that made us
sleep in such a place.

13
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:46,954
Your sense of reality is in the pits, really!

14
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:48,355
In the pits? You wretched girl...

15
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:49,956
It's cold.

16
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:53,560
If you want so much to get away from me,
you leave.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,962
I will stay like this temporarily.

18
00:00:54,962 --> 00:00:56,263
Temporarily until when?

19
00:00:56,263 --> 00:01:00,067
I won't tell you. Just know that living 
apart from you is the wish of my life.

20
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:03,671
Attain your life's wish now itself.
Live apart. Hurry, leave now.

21
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,773
You just wait. I will do just that.

22
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:07,775
What? You let them stay in the garage?

23
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,477
You out of your mind?
How can you let people stay in the garage?

24
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:13,981
Even the garage won't work?
What you are doing is too much!

25
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,683
Too much or too small,
get them out quickly.

26
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:18,285
Min Hyeok is in that shape. Why the heck
bring outsiders into the house?

27
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:19,887
Even families have secrets to keep.

28
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:22,189
They have nowhere to go, you know.
They are Soe Dol's family.

29
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,491
Soe Dol's family, so what?
How long back did he die?

30
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:27,394
Absolutely no way.
Send them out first thing tomorrow morning!

31
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:29,496
Damn, I'm cancer-stricken!

32
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:31,699
Cancer-stricken, so what?
Stop this old cancer talk.

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,300
He said it's in an early stage.
Why go overboard like this?

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,104
It's not overboard. I know this.
My mom was in the same shape too.

35
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:39,707
I know it...

36
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:45,312
My ending will be the same as Mom's.
No mistaking it.

37
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:49,116
My sad premonitions never miss the mark.

38
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,719
Yeah right, sad premonition!
It never fails to go wrong.

39
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,919
What?

40
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,321
What do you mean what?

41
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:57,224
Bo Yeong wasn't feeling well, but did that
premonition say that she was pregnant?

42
00:01:57,324 --> 00:02:00,027
Father-in-law had blood in his stool, and did
the premonition say it was hemorrhoids?

43
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:01,028
What had it got correct?

44
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:02,830
Why bring up old matters?

45
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:06,834
Anyway from now on,
I'll do things I wish to do.

46
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:09,737
To those who did favors to me,
I want to do good things, okay?

47
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:12,039
Only then will I have no regrets
whatever happens to me.

48
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,642
Doing good things or repaying favors
is all up to you.

49
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:17,745
Those people in the garage
must be sent out pronto tomorrow!

50
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:20,447
Give a bit of thought to me losing face, please!

51
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:21,749
What's with you, really?

52
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,951
It's a garage that I gave to
them who deserve a room!

53
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:26,153
Even that I cannot do? Really?

54
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:27,755
Just give them money for
them to go find a place.

55
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,457
Whatever... Forget it.
I too don't give a damn.

56
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:33,661
When I'm already cancer-stricken,
must you make me lose face too?

57
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:36,063
If I said no way, it means no way!

58
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:38,565
But how do we eat some food?

59
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,067
What do we do for a bathroom?

60
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,569
They'll have to let us use a bathroom.

61
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,471
Would they ask us to eat with them?

62
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:45,973
That would be the best.

63
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:48,676
Not sure of a bathroom, but eating... well...

64
00:02:48,976 --> 00:02:52,079
Rich people would never want to
face people like us.

65
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,480
Is it so?

66
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,784
Well, anyway we get a good look
at a rich family's house.

67
00:02:56,784 --> 00:02:59,286
Where we step out from here
is a proper garden.

68
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:00,287
<i>Huh?</i>

69
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,089
<i>Don't step into the garden?</i>

70
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,793
I had to agree on that with my wife. I am sorry.

71
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:10,998
But if we can't step into the garden,
how can we come in?

72
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:14,602
Through the roll-up shutter 
garage entrance.

73
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:19,006
My wife has become damn sensitive lately
since our oldest son got hurt, that's why.

74
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,507
Please understand it for me.

75
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:26,213
If it's through the shutters, that means we wait
for a car to return and only then get in?

76
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:28,515
I will get a garage remote made for you.

77
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:33,120
On this itself, my wife was asking
how we could open it for outsiders?

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,022
I insisted that I would open it.

79
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,523
Thank you so much.

80
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:39,827
Then, let me know if there is any discomfort.

81
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,629
Then, excuse me...

82
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:46,634
From now on, what's going to happen?

83
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:49,737
I'm told the CEO's falling incident
will be investigated by the police.

84
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:50,638
Really?

85
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:51,739
Yes.

86
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:55,943
Seeing them investigate, it appears not to be
a pure accident. Who would have done it?

87
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:56,844
Not sure.

88
00:03:56,944 --> 00:04:00,748
And also, there is a rumor that
the CEO's condition isn't normal.

89
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:01,949
Really?

90
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:06,654
Team leader, you go every day to top staff
meetings, but you seem clueless on this.

91
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:07,755
An outcast now?

92
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,156
Me?

93
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:14,061
<i>Adviser, sir.</i>

94
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,766
<i>You weren't supposed to step into the garden.</i>

95
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:20,668
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

96
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:22,569
<i>What is it?</i>

97
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,174
<i>Could I ask you if the CEO is doing all right?</i>

98
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:28,576
<i>I was just worried.</i>

99
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:31,779
<i>He's fine. If you're asked at the company,
just say he is fine.</i>

100
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,986
<i>I told Chauffeur Gim to keep it a secret that you
are living at my house, so nobody will ask you.</i>

101
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:40,588
<i>But don't come out and say anything.</i>

102
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,401
<i>Why are you eating alone?</i>

103
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,102
<i>What?</i>

104
00:04:55,102 --> 00:05:00,207
<i>An open outcast or 
quietly isolated?</i>

105
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,116
What's this?

106
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,824
Don't do this to me today, okay?

107
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:28,736
<i>For this graphics, it's enough
if you fill in your survey data.
Try typing it.</i>

108
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:34,341
Where did you go and why won't 
you show up? Hongberg...

109
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:37,044
Miss Jin A, you aren't coming to the dinner party?

110
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:40,047
I'll try finishing this proposal
and then come over.

111
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:43,050
Do it later. Come fast.

112
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:50,157
But, team leader, I shouldn't
think of having drinks today.

113
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:51,959
Is it okay if I don't drink?

114
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,171
I thought you said you wouldn't drink...

115
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:06,073
Miss Jin A, is something wrong?

116
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,875
Or something unpleasant?

117
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:11,278
Nothing like that.

118
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:15,382
It's like this, just like that...
They all suddenly disappeared.

119
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,184
Damn, it's messed up!

120
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:20,988
You'll all be fine when you leave.
But what about me? Me!

121
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,307
Mom.

122
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:41,508
Coming only now?

123
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:42,409
You were drinking?

124
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,312
Yeah.. Dinner party.

125
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:45,913
Why are you here?

126
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:48,215
Came out to pee, but couldn't get back in.

127
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:52,219
Damn, this place really sucks. To any restroom
in this residential area, it is 3 miles!

128
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,321
Gosh, they should let us use
at least a potty, seriously!

129
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:58,225
But street lights are bright, so I wasn't
scared at night. Now, that is great!

130
00:06:58,225 --> 00:07:02,229
Even if it's night, I need not come to get you.
That's all really great, yeah sure!

131
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,134
If he's giving a remote, give it fast!
Why make us wait for a car to come?

132
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,738
It's really petty, really.

133
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:20,447
<i>Do the surgery on Monday.
Stay for 2 days afterwards.</i>

134
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,166
Get up. The car's here.

135
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,983
You've returned?

136
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:58,886
Any inconvenience, yet?

137
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:04,792
Well... When can we get the
shutter remote, I wonder...

138
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,794
That's right. Here!

139
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:07,995
Thank you.

140
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:14,001
How come so...

141
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:19,405
How come you look so distressed?

142
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,809
Is it that obvious... on me?

143
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:27,114
That is... sort of... like that.

144
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:28,515
What is it?

145
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:33,320
That day I happened to overhear.
It seemed you talked of cancer.

146
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,823
Are you seriously ill?

147
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:38,826
Is it really showing?

148
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:43,931
I must undergo surgery, in 3 days.

149
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,833
Ah, I see...

150
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,935
That is a secret.

151
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:51,238
Other than my wife, nobody knows it.

152
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:57,645
If other family folks know,
it will throw them into chaos.

153
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:01,448
Your dad is having a tumor surgery on Monday.

154
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,349
What tumor?

155
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,051
Something minuscule on the kidney.

156
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:07,454
As I'm told, it's in fact a cancer.
As it's early, remove it and it's done.

157
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:10,057
The surgery is simpler than
even an appendicitis surgery.

158
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:11,759
No need to cut open anywhere else?

159
00:09:11,859 --> 00:09:13,761
Yes. Early stage.

160
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,563
Saying the family would be in confusion
he had asked not to tell.

161
00:09:16,563 --> 00:09:18,065
But there was nothing here
to keep it a secret.

162
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:19,867
So I am keeping you posted.

163
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:22,069
Bo Yeong.

164
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:25,172
Why keep it a secret? 
What big chaos?

165
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:27,675
The fellow really goes overboard!

166
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:32,580
Cheol Min. Why do you keep groaning
and squealing these days?

167
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,582
Are you feeling unwell?

168
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,284
You're back, dad?

169
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,487
Dad, I heard you have a surgery on Monday?

170
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:42,389
Who said that?

171
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:43,290
Mom did.

172
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,593
Have a great surgery. Fighting!

173
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:53,100
Brat... Fine, this dad... will do the fighting.

174
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,202
I wanted to keep it a secret
from you till the end...

175
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:56,904
What's with you?

176
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,809
Father.

177
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,811
Please don't worry too much.

178
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:07,615
Whatever happens, I won't cry.
So father, you too--

179
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,316
Is he not going to croak it?

180
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:12,820
Croak it...

181
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:23,030
- Father.
- Cheol Min,

182
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,632
What's wrong?

183
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:31,038
I see. Good job.

184
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:33,040
You're back?

185
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,343
Why did you tell the family about the surgery?

186
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:38,145
What's the big deal if I did?

187
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,747
What? Somebody said something?

188
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:42,349
Who cares to say anything?

189
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,852
Who has any concern for me anyway?

190
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:45,853
What is wrong?

191
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:49,056
After talking of the surgery, there was
no big commotion, so you are angry?

192
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:55,663
Su Yeong at least said a "fighting".
But my father... seriously!

193
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:48,015
It's cold.

194
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,826
So cold.

195
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:11,639
I'm leaving to see Min Hyeok at the hospital.
You're going somewhere?

196
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,340
I have to take this fellow to the vet.

197
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,241
You want me to take you?

198
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:17,044
It's fine. I'll walk over there.

199
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:28,455
Hello--

200
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,161
Her manners!

201
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,465
Where did the wretched girl go?

202
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:58,085
Mom. I'm scared.

203
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:01,488
The surgery is day after tomorrow.

204
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,893
I'm worried to death, about the fellow.

205
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:09,196
All the odd thoughts come up suddenly.

206
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:13,300
If it goes wrong and something happens
to the fellow, what will I do, I wonder.

207
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:16,003
I keep tearing up...

208
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:17,504
<i>Father.</i>

209
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,807
I don't know if he can withstand a surgery.

210
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,508
The fellow has some age too...

211
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,811
<i>Please don't worry, father.</i>

212
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:26,213
<i>I... shall firmly withstand it.</i>

213
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:27,615
Please don't say such things.

214
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:31,719
I can't live without the fellow.
I can't live even for a day.

215
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,024
Every day, he's so happy when I come in,
moving my heart.

216
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:42,229
In the morning when my eyes are closed,
he comes to lick my face.

217
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:45,232
Really... I can't live without this fellow.

218
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:46,333
Bye then.

219
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,134
Father!

220
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:48,035
Oh so suddenly!

221
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,336
Why do you yell and get on my nerves?

222
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:50,838
So the fellow was Cheol Min?

223
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:53,841
Without whom you won't live.
Thinking of whom brings out tears.

224
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:57,244
The one who won't withstand
a surgery... is not me then!

225
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:58,445
I am your son.

226
00:13:58,445 --> 00:13:59,546
I am cancer-stricken..

227
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:02,750
What's with you? Your surgery is simple.
It's the early stages.

228
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,953
But I have cancer you know!
Cancer, cancer. Cancer!

229
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,855
What surgery does this whelp have?

230
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:09,056
Does this whelp have cancer?

231
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,457
He has kidney trouble. Why?

232
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:13,260
The whelp has some kidney stone.
I have cancer!

233
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,262
I'm your cancer-stricken son, okay!

234
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:19,366
This whelp is not a person, but a dog!
All he has is kidney stones.

235
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:22,269
I can't even get as much of your
concern as this whelp does? Huh?

236
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:27,174
- You stupid fellow!
- Father, you never liked me even
getting into your sight, no? Right?

237
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,779
The moment you gave a son of a bitch
a human name, I knew it!

238
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,782
This whelp is more of a son to you than me?
Right?

239
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:35,583
Dad, why are you like this?

240
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:37,184
Let go! 
Father!

241
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:40,087
You really shouldn't be treating me like this!

242
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:45,292
Once I'm dead and gone, you can be
with this whelp for a million years...

243
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:47,394
Dad.

244
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:49,196
Why is he like that?

245
00:14:49,196 --> 00:14:51,098
That twerp... seriously.

246
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,201
If that twerp is like this, what's he good for?

247
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:56,704
I am back.

248
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:57,905
You're here?

249
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,407
Did my son sleep well?

250
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,512
But why are you sitting like that today
without seeing NarARa Superboard?
(Korean animation circa 1992)

251
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,115
In NarARa Superboard, when he sees the
Son O Gong monkey fool scenes,
(Korean animation circa 1992)

252
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:09,416
he gets stressed out.
<i> </i>
(Korean animation circa 1992)

253
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:11,118
Why would Son O Gong monkey fool
stress him out?

254
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,821
Then we used to ask him to
recall this Gong or that Gong,

255
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,623
so he may've got some
psychological damage.

256
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,425
I think he feels he has the
same plight as Son O Gong.

257
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,127
Suddenly he can't get even a bit of sleep.

258
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,429
Really? You did a good job. Go back.

259
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,431
Min Hyeok. See you tomorrow.

260
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:29,336
My son is a bit down on
NarARa Superboard, huh?

261
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:30,638
What do we do to play?

262
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:33,741
You remember the Tarzan song?

263
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,843
The one you sang every day 
in kindergarten days.

264
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:38,846
Don't you remember?

265
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,648
I can remember it.

266
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,753
Tarzan has 10 Wons worth of
underpants on him.

267
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:49,156
20-Wons is the sword that he will
wield as he sings songs.

268
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:52,359
Remember it? 
Join me.

269
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:55,963
Tarzan has 20-Wons worth of
underpants on him.

270
00:15:55,963 --> 00:15:58,065
- 30-Wons is the sword that he will--
- Mom, I get nausea...

271
00:15:58,065 --> 00:15:59,166
I want to go out.

272
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,467
We'll do that?

273
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,169
Okay.

274
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,571
Hey, my friend. 
How many times should I say?

275
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:06,173
Really, it is not a serious surgery.

276
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,675
My mom's was also the same.

277
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,677
She was operated on saying
it was nothing serious.

278
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:11,679
That was in old days.

279
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,282
For you, we've done all the cell biopsies.
It's just fine. Pefectly clean.

280
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:18,986
Don't worry, and come over thinking
you are getting a stomach inspection.

281
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,801
It's hot.

282
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:38,605
Really hot.
Oh... friggin hot.

283
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,031
Happy to have come outside?

284
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,233
In a little while, you can play the 
memory game with the doctor.

285
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,636
Shall we do a bit of practice?

286
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:09,837
No.

287
00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:11,538
You don't like anything today?

288
00:17:12,138 --> 00:17:14,041
Ah, right! Shall we do some Tamagotchi?
<i> </i>
(Japanese electronic pet game, mid 1990s)

289
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,444
What I had brought for you earlier
as you wanted to play pet-raising?
(Japanese electronic pet game, mid 1990s)

290
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:20,347
Then wait a little bit. 
I'll go to the car and get it.

291
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,265
Tarzan has 10 Wons worth of
underpants on him.

292
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,668
- 20-Wons is the sword that he will--
- CEO sir?

293
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,779
Is this where you were? In this hospital?

294
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:53,280
Who are you?

295
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,582
Huh?

296
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,885
It's me, Na Jin A.

297
00:17:57,885 --> 00:17:59,887
Na Jin A?

298
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,590
Don't you remember me?

299
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,492
Intern... Na Jin A.

300
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,394
Intern... What's that?

301
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,500
Then, you don't remember anything
about the company either?

302
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:16,804
How come?

303
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:21,108
Then nuna... Are you a nuna in our company?
<i> </i>
(Nuna - sister or elder girl to a male)

304
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:23,911
Yes. But I'm not a nuna to you.

305
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,013
Na Ji Na, is what you've been calling me.

306
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:27,514
I see.

307
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:29,316
Ms. Na Jin A.

308
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,018
Yes.

309
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:34,221
What work do you do at our company?

310
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,123
What work?

311
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:39,226
It was just... whatever you asked, CEO sir.

312
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,028
Really?

313
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:48,335
Then, if I need something bought from there,
will you buy it for me?

314
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:49,536
What?

315
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:50,638
What would be...

316
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:52,339
Ice cream!

317
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,943
Ice cream?
Sure.

318
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:59,146
But... I don't have my wallet with me.

319
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,951
Instead, I'll surely buy it later for you.

320
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,552
Really?

321
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:07,855
Yes. 
Promise...

322
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:13,060
This is a telephone, right?

323
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,662
Let me know your phone number.

324
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:16,263
My phone number?

325
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:20,267
You knew it earlier...

326
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,871
010-?34267.

327
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,872
Shall I write it for you?

328
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,373
I don't have a pencil.

329
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:30,477
010.. ?3403...

330
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:32,580
434267.

331
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,583
010-?434267.

332
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,884
<i>Who are you?</i>

333
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:47,895
010-?434267.

334
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,097
That means you are...
that Soe Dol's daughter?

335
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,299
Yes. I'm sorry.

336
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,003
How can you think of getting
in the car after getting drunk?

337
00:19:56,804 --> 00:20:00,507
This is why I told him not to let people
into the garage. In the end...

338
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:02,810
I'm sorry.

339
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,812
I heard you were an intern in our company.

340
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,213
What will you be saying in the company?

341
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:06,914
What?

342
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,515
What will you say about Min Hyeok, I mean.

343
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:10,117
What did you feel, seeing Min Hyeok?

344
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,821
Tell me honestly.

345
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,423
After seeing Min Hyeok, what did you
feel his condition is?

346
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:19,200
- I did...
- Idiot? Like an idiot?

347
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,227
Idiot is what you'll say?

348
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:24,431
No, no. "I didn't know for sure when I met him
just now" was what I was going to say.

349
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:28,435
But he seems to have lost some memory.

350
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,237
That's what you'll go to
the company and say?

351
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:31,338
You're a cheap-mouth, right?

352
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,640
No. I am not.

353
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,643
Seeing that mouth on the face, if you open it
it's big enough to fill it, so it must be cheap!

354
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:37,344
It's nooot soooo....

355
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:40,848
Sure? Then, take it like
you never saw Min Hyeok today.

356
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,850
- Do you keep your word?
- Yes.

357
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,552
Why do I see your eyes go here and there,
like you won't be keeping it?

358
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:46,754
I will be keeping my word.

359
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,262
Dad's now on the way to get admitted.

360
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:56,864
Okay.

361
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,268
Oh... It is Grandfather.
Cheol Min is also getting admitted today.

362
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:02,870
Admitted?

363
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,672
That whelp too?

364
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,374
Let's take Grandfather to
Cheol Min's vet.

365
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:09,176
- Chauffeur Gim...
- Leave it.

366
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,679
Just go on, Chauffeur Gim.

367
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:39,707
You have been at the Adviser's house?

368
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:43,611
Not at the house. In the garage.

369
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,314
I had a bit of a situation, so
the Adviser sir helped out.

370
00:21:47,615 --> 00:21:49,717
But how did you know of that?

371
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:53,520
If it has to do with the company, won't I 
know it all like the back of my palm?

372
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,022
I heard you are Na Soe Dol's daughter.

373
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,724
Yes. Did you know my dad?

374
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:58,525
Not just knowing...

375
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,027
He was close to me too.

376
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:02,029
Really? My dad--

377
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,232
CEO No Min Hyeok...
What is his current status?

378
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,533
Pardon?

379
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:10,638
<i>Then, take it like you never saw 
Min Hyeok today.</i>

380
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:14,642
I don't know... all that well...

381
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:19,046
Is the CEO right now at the house...
or at the hospital?

382
00:22:19,146 --> 00:22:23,651
I'm not sure. As I stay in the garage,
I don't know of anything.

383
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:30,557
How come Father-in-law's health is not-so-good?

384
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,558
I'm not sure.

385
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:36,664
He is jealous of Cheol Min, and unsatisfied with
Grandfather, which is really his condition.

386
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:41,568
In any case, he would like it if we worry a lot,
so show some good concern. Do you see?

387
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:43,370
- Yeah.
- Our dad, geez...

388
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,072
- You guys too?
- Yes.

389
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:46,573
Gim Gyu Yeong.
Why didn't you answer?

390
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,975
What?

391
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,476
What is it you asked?

392
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:54,181
Dad, eonni and family are here.
(Eonni - elder sister)

393
00:22:54,181 --> 00:22:55,883
- Hello.
- Hello.

394
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:59,086
Oh my, father-in-law! Such a troublesome
surgery... what do we do?

395
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:01,889
Well... No other option...

396
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:05,793
Life is all like this, no? One only looks 
for a narrow escape from death...

397
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:09,496
You shouldn't say stuff like escaping death!
Dad, you have to live a long time.

398
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,201
Thank you.

399
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:17,004
Mom has to be in charge at oppa's room, 
so she can't come today. You know it, right?

400
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:20,007
Of course she should watch Min Hyeok.

401
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:25,613
But... in the end your grandfather...
isn't coming, is he?

402
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,715
Grandfather... well, it's that
there is nobody at home.

403
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,516
Don't say it's to watch the house!

404
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,919
He is surely hugging and pampering
that whelp Cheol Min.

405
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:36,423
To my father, that son of a bitch is a million times
more precious than this cancer-stricken me.

406
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:39,627
Why do you say it like that?
Cheol Min's is also a major surgery.

407
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,729
Then me? I have cancer!

408
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,832
Father will come to his senses only once I die.

409
00:23:44,932 --> 00:23:48,335
No. Even if I die, he'll only be
pampering that whelp Cheol Min.

410
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:50,237
This really sucks.

411
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,653
I'll go to dad and come, okay?

412
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,764
As the patient in room 2 could not sleep all night,
he's to be given a sleep inducer dose after dinner. 
You know it?

413
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:18,666
Yes, we know that.

414
00:24:34,582 --> 00:24:35,382
Hello.

415
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:37,985
It is 010-?434267, right?

416
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:38,686
What?

417
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,288
Ms. Nuna Jin A...

418
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,390
Nuna Jin A?

419
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,091
Who are you?

420
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,993
I am No Min Hyeok.

421
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:49,096
CEO sir. But why are you...

422
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:52,299
You said you'd buy me ice cream but
why haven't you bought it for me?

423
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,303
That... I was supposed to buy
when we meet next time.

424
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:59,406
Why not ask Mom to buy it today,
and next time I can--

425
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:01,709
Not what I want... Buy it for me now.

426
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,711
I am all alone now.

427
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:05,913
Where are you?

428
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:07,915
9th floor. 9.

429
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:08,716
What room?

430
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:09,917
Number 2.

431
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:12,419
Hello? CEO sir?

432
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,725
Mr. No Su Dong, please be ready to
go into the surgery room in 5 minutes.

433
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,727
Dad, "fighting!". You got it?

434
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:23,530
I guess it is that whelp Cheol Min
who has my father with him for surgery.

435
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:29,637
Fine. You just watch.
I won't forget this till I die.

436
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:33,240
You all watch closely how I will
treat your grandfather till I die!

437
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,442
What kind of pointless crap
are you saying to the kids?

438
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:37,945
He did say he would come.
Must be stuck in traffic on the way.

439
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:40,547
What is the point if he comes only after 
that whelp Cheol Min's surgery is done?

440
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:42,349
That's even more disgusting!

441
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:48,756
A surgery is supposed to go well only if
one goes in with a happy mood.

442
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:52,760
Going in with this kind of a mood,
is it possible for the surgery to go well?

443
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,561
I guess it probably won't.

444
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:57,364
I don't have the will to even live.

445
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,167
- Looks like Grandfather has come.
- You are here?

446
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,169
You still haven't gone into surgery?

447
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,871
What did you come here for, now?

448
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:05,372
What?

449
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:08,175
You rascal, I had a hard time getting here,
and you ask what for?

450
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,777
Father, I'll ask you just one thing.

451
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:15,082
You came because that son of a bitch
Cheol Min's surgery got done,
or was it despite it going on?

452
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:17,785
So what about it?
Useless fellow.

453
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,989
Please do tell. Going into surgery with this kind
of a mood, makes me feel discomfort.

454
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:25,492
Did you came once Cheol Min's surgery
was done, or while it was going on?

455
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:27,194
- Oh, stop it. 
- Father.

456
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:28,395
We will be moving you in for surgery.

457
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:33,500
Wait a moment. Tell me please. You came after
Cheol Min's surgery was done. Isn't it so?

458
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,703
Please tell me. I asked you to please tell me!

459
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,706
Hold on a moment.

460
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,207
One moment, stop!

461
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:41,408
Stop right here.

462
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:43,410
There, there, there, there, useless fellow!

463
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,412
Damn, when will he get some sense?

464
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:48,415
I'm administering anesthesia.

465
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:54,722
Father. Cheol Min is what...

466
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,924
Why is he so unanesthetized?

467
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:59,226
Why is this patient whispering?

468
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:08,435
Cheol Min is a son of a bitch. 
I will have you dead and...

469
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:21,048
What are you here for?

470
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:23,150
I came to visit Mr. No Min Hyeok in room 2.

471
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,753
Visitors are prohibited for the room 2 patient.

472
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:31,058
Is that so? Would it be all right
for you to pass this on to him?

473
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:32,860
As it is ice cream, I fear it will melt.

474
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,663
Outside food is also prohibited.

475
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:38,365
I had said I'd get it for him...

476
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:40,668
You got it, right?

477
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,377
It will all melt. What to do?

478
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,086
You can't sleep well lately, right?

479
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:01,889
Once you get this shot, sleep will come.

480
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:29,617
Nuna!

481
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:33,020
Keep it quiet. The nurse said
that visits are prohibited.

482
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,021
You bought ice cream and came?

483
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:35,022
Yes.

484
00:28:35,623 --> 00:28:40,127
It has melted a bit. We will keep it in 
the freezer for a bit before having it.

485
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:44,531
Also, I'm not a nuna, CEO sir.
Please call me Ms. Na Jin A.

486
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,334
Okay...

487
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,143
When I got your call earlier, I was a little lost.

488
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:58,045
But now I feel right about this.

489
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:03,250
As I met you so suddenly last time,
there was a lot that I couldn't say.

490
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,152
What is it that you couldn't say?

491
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:09,056
First of all, so happy to see you.
Really!

492
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:13,160
And then, have you been doing well?

493
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:23,570
It is like I had a lot to say.
But I don't remember anything.

494
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:26,774
So I get scared.

495
00:29:26,874 --> 00:29:29,677
As I don't know what I might have lost.

496
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:33,080
Thoughts will slowly come out.
Please don't get too worried.

497
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,184
Everybody at the company is looking forward
to you getting healthy and returning, CEO sir.

498
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:40,187
Because in our company, you are...
like this!

499
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:45,092
I... What kind of person was I?

500
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,795
What kind of person you were, you mean?

501
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:53,200
Can I tell you as we eat the ice cream?
I think it should be frozen by now.

502
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,602
Fine.

503
00:29:55,302 --> 00:30:00,107
Last time when you asked me to get it, a child had
bought ice cream and was eating something else.

504
00:30:00,107 --> 00:30:02,409
It is that ice cream that 
you want to eat first, right?

505
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,413
Are you sleepy?

506
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:07,514
No, I'm not.

507
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:09,617
If you are sleepy, you want to
sleep and eat it later?

508
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:11,418
If you eat it now, you will 
have to brush your teeth.

509
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,321
It's all right. Please tell me the things.

510
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:19,627
Sure. First, you are a smart person
who is even a Harvard graduate.

511
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:21,528
What is this harvard?

512
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:25,132
It is the best university in the world.

513
00:30:25,232 --> 00:30:27,735
Even with that, you were quite humble.

514
00:30:27,735 --> 00:30:30,537
<i>There are two ways to be successful in life.</i>

515
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:33,841
<i>Either you're great,
or you stick alongside someone great.</i>

516
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:36,844
<i>If I am of the first type,
you are all of the second type.</i>

517
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,946
<i>Because you met me.</i>

518
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,249
You were always warm and friendly with people.

519
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:46,553
<i>Hating those gasbags who tout their worthless
degrees, I had picked you instead, Na Jin A.</i>

520
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:49,156
<i>But it's equally useless after all.</i>

521
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:55,462
More than anything, you're the one who let me
join the company... which I'm thankful for.

522
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:09,777
Ice Cream...

523
00:31:09,977 --> 00:31:11,078
It is right here.

524
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,980
Sleep and eat it later.

525
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,983
Put it in the fridge.

526
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:18,786
Yes. I'll put in the fridge.

527
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:20,688
Ms. Na Jin A.

528
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:22,089
Yes?

529
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:32,000
- Later on... Is it okay to call you again?
- Yes.

531
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:26,153
I am told my grandson was doing 
a bit of mischief. I'm really sorry.

532
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:27,855
Are you an ocean seal? A monkey?

533
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:29,256
Who threw this out?

534
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:30,758
I guess we can't throw trash out now...

535
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:31,759
This is trash?

536
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,560
Whatever it is that is uncomfortable,
feel free to tell.

537
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,864
If you could lend us a pot, so we could
cook something to eat...

538
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,066
Better know that this is all because 
your mom is a good one.

539
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:39,867
CEO sir?

540
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,368
Yes, are you doing fine?

541
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:42,369
And you, CEO sir?

542
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:43,771
Shall we cajole Na Jin A into it?

543
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:45,773
Even if we make her come to our side,
if she fails, we're finished.

544
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:47,274
Sister-in-law, come in and
take care of business.

545
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:48,075
Whatever.

546
00:32:48,075 --> 00:32:48,876
No!
Please go back.

547
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:51,579
She just wants to use a bathroom. 
Even that isn't allowed?

548
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:54,081
Is this family into playing with people or what?
