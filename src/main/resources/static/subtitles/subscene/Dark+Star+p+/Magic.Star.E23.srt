2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,140
Stop wasting effort.

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,100
I've sent men to block the entrance and exit.

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
Just be obedient and surrender to us.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,500
You are quite nimble.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,800
You are everywhere.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,700
Stop giving me nonsense!

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,800
If you kneel now and beg me, you may be spared of pain.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,300
Wait!

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,200
I urge you to clarify first my identity before making your move.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,170
Or else, later, I might let you take the consequences.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,000
What nonsense are you spouting?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,200
Your Elder Jiong Ye, which is also your superior,

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,100
do you all know he is my what?

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,450
He is my father.

16
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,000
He's my biological father.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,700
That's why, right now, I can be counted as your...

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,500
- What is that thing?<br>- Young Master.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Young Master.

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,600
Aren't you all going to hurry and kneel yet to show respect to your Young Master?

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,900
Elder Jiong Ye acted against the sect's teachings and disrespected Elder Zhao Ran.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,000
Yet you are shamelessly saying all those words here?!

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,400
Totally seditious!

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,930
Good then.

25
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,400
Men! Take them both!

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,600
Kill anyone who resists!

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
Hey! Do your Illuminati still have any rules about respecting your elders?

28
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,100
Look how strict the security is here.

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,690
How are we going to get out?

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,100
Hurry. Hurry.

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,300
Here.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
<i>Hey! Stop right there!</i>

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,400
<i>- This is an important prison area.<br></i>- Let's go.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,900
<i>What are you two doing?</i>

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,000
Give you a chance.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
- Big Bros, I've something very good here to give to you.<br>- What? What?

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,100
You have skills.

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,000
Who told you to belittle me?

39
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,290
Hurry and save them.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,210
- Let's go. Hurry and go.<br>- Go.

41
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,600
Hurry up.

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,200
Be careful!

43
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,640
Are you alright?

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
Gong Zi Xu is also with these people, right?

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,770
All of you, stop daydreaming!

46
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,100
Just surrender and be arrested!

47
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Ah Ning, defending an evil one like this, you won't have a good ending!

48
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,400
I am afraid you won't be able to see the result anymore.

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
You and Elder Zhao Ran rebelled together and destroyed the reputation of the Illuminati.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Do you think that by doing that, you're going to get any benefits?

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Is there any use for these words that you said?

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,600
Elder Zhao Ran said that the past Illuminati has been drowned out.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,300
And these young children will lead the Illuminati to walk into the future.

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,000
The mighty Elder Zhao Ran will lead the Illuminati to recover its past glory!

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,800
It's not something that you ants can hinder!

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,600
Loathing the past and looking ahead at the future?

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,400
Then are people's lives not important anymore?

58
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,600
Then just die for the future of the Illuminati then.

59
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,250
Stop misleading the public here!

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,800
Take them all down!

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,300
- Older Bro Fei, how are you?<br>- Yuan Shuai.

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,000
- If you have guts, then just attack!<br>- Charge!

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Charge!

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,300
Be careful!

65
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Let's go!

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,500
Quickly go! Go!

67
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
<i>The time didn't pass.</i>

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
<i>I've been walking for quite a long time and again returned here.</i>

69
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,700
<i>The time didn't change at all.</i>

70
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,500
What really is going on here?

71
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,600
Zhao Ran?

72
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,840
You really made it hard for me to find you.

73
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,600
It turns out that you're here.

74
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Where is the Magic Star?

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Don't daydream anymore.

76
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,120
Stop your nonsense.

77
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,000
Give me the Magic Star!

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,430
Do you want the Magic Star?

79
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,300
You first have to get past me.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,600
Zi Su...

81
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Be careful.

82
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,790
What's wrong?

83
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,400
What's wrong with you? Are you alright?

84
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,090
Hurry and find Elder Chang Ming.

85
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,200
Or else, the Illuminati will be done for.

86
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,680
But Elder Chang Ming has been in seclusion for so many years.

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,700
I don't really know where his seclusion chamber is.

88
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,410
The seclusion chamber is inside the labyrinth.

89
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,600
How come you don't know that?

90
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,850
A Ji Ya, there are a lot of things that happened in between these past years.

91
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,500
You don't really understand the real situation.

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,850
Then what should we do?

93
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,400
Just letting Elder Zhao Ran continue with his tyrannical abuse?

94
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,800
Don't we have any other way at all?

95
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,330
The Elder Chang Ming that you're talking about has already been gravely injured by Elder Zhao Ran;

96
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,200
don't know if he's dead or alive.

97
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,500
These three people here are the envoys sent by Elder Chang Ming.

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,490
Elder Chang Ming?

99
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,500
Not sure if dead or alive?

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,300
A Ji Ya!

101
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,000
- A Ji Ya!<br>- A Ji Ya!

102
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,800
Bai Ze!

103
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,370
<i>♫ I'm sorry that I'm not a doll ♫</i>

104
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,700
<i>♫ Smiling for a long time will make me tired ♫</i>

105
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,750
<i>♫ Whatever way I want to think, I think that way. ♫</i>

106
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,400
<i>♫ I'm too lazy to pretend again ♫</i>

107
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,150
<i>♫ I'm sorry that I'm not good in imitating ♫</i>

108
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,200
<i>♫ that kind of graciousness you want ♫</i>

109
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,800
A Ji Ya...

110
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,670
No matter if we can get out of this labyrinth today or not,

111
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,630
there are some words in my heart that I must tell you.

112
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,800
I'll bear this familial revenge of yours together with you.

113
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,900
You hate me and blame me.

114
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,700
I will bear all of them.

115
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,100
But the remaining sins... have nothing to do with them.

116
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,680
If killing me can make you happy,

117
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,000
I am willing to die for you.

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,470
<i>♫ that you could let go any time because you’re bored ♫</i>

119
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:49,400
<i>♫ as nothing has happened ♫</i>

120
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,230
<i>♫ I'm sorry that I'm not a doll ♫</i>

121
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,200
<i>♫ Smiling for a long time will make me tired ♫</i>

122
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,400
<i>♫ Whatever way I want to think, I think that way ♫</i>

123
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,220
Look, Lord! Over there!

124
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,320
<i>♫ I'm sorry that I'm not good in imitating ♫</i>

125
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
A Ji Ya! A Ji Ya!

126
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,600
A Ji Ya!

127
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
- A Ji Ya!<br>- A Ji Ya!

128
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,200
A Ji Ya!

129
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,500
- A Ji Ya! <br>- A Ji Ya!

130
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,200
Ah Ning... I'll let you die a tragic death!

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,800
A Ji Ya!

132
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,940
Stop them! Hurry!

133
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,250
Ah Ning!

134
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,780
<i>A Ji Ya, we grew up together.</i>

135
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,240
<i>You are in almost all my memories.</i>

136
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,950
<i>You divided a dagger into two and gave me one of them.</i>

137
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,840
<i>I have always treasured and kept it by my side.</i>

138
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,460
<i>To invite Oldest Elder Chang Ming to come back and take charge of matters...</i>

139
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,690
<i>At this time, am I not the one who should stand out and bear that responsibility?</i>

140
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,230
Wait for me here.

141
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,930
Looks like absorbing the powers of young children, you real are indeed extraordinary.

142
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,750
But what's the use?

143
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,520
Today, you will die here as a sacrificial offering to those dead children.

144
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,270
Aren't you thinking so simply?

145
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,730
The thousands of years of glory of the Illuminati will be revived during my time.

146
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,740
If you don't want to die, just obediently hand over the Magic Star.

147
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,230
I can give you a not-so-bad ending at the very least.

148
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,670
I don't know where the Magic Star came from,

149
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,830
but it has never belonged to the mortal world.

150
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,130
Do you know why this underground palace exists?

151
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,520
The duty to guard the door connecting the Strange World to the mortal world has long been forgotten.

152
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,600
I think... you and me both should remember it very clearly.

153
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,970
Right now, I already found clues in the Bloody Pool on how to open the Strange World's main door.

154
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,650
As long as I can gather all Magic Stars, I can then absorb unending power.

155
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,400
By that time, I can then open the door to the Strange World, rule both the Strange and Human worlds,

156
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,540
using the Illuminati's name to fulfill this grand ambition!

157
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,020
Did your brain get stuck in the door?

158
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,730
Can you even have these kinds of daydreams?

159
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,020
The helmet that the Demon King left in the mortal world was in the Bloody Pool.

160
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,480
I controlled myself numerous times and dared not to wear it.

161
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,630
But once I have the Magic Stars, it will be different. When that time comes,

162
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,490
using the Magic Stars' power, I can stimulate the power within the demonic helmet.

163
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,800
The person who will obtain all its power will be me.

164
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,820
The Demon King's Helmet?

165
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,230
Let's go.

166
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,870
Mister, you are...

167
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,910
He Cao... are you willing to serve me loyally forever?

168
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,300
Yes.

169
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,770
Since Elder Jiong Ye got sick, I transferred under Elder Zhao Ran

170
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,130
and became his lackey.

171
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,210
Right now, at this moment, it's his time to pay back everything.

172
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,890
Older Bro Fei, where are you going?

173
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm going to look for Elder Zhao Ran to seek vengeance for A Ji Ya.

174
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,700
Let's go help, too.

175
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,500
Mister!

176
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,340
What's going on?

177
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,750
Helmet?

178
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,940
You don't have much time left now.

179
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,490
Think about if you want to obediently hand over the Magic Star. At the very least,

180
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,170
I can leave you a tablet inside the Three Sacred Palace.

181
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,760
In the past, you killed Elder Chang Ming

182
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,300
and then made a lie that he was training in seclusion.

183
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,760
And now, you're telling me that you are going to make me a tablet?

184
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,690
I am not stupid.

185
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,560
It seems that the explosion came from there.

186
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,010
Let's go inside and take a look. Let's go.

187
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,770
- Let's go.<br>- Let's go.

188
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,830
This is not the place that you can enter.

189
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,870
Leave now, you all.

190
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,880
Big Bro Chong Yun!

191
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,170
The Magic Star!

192
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,680
Are you alright?

193
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,770
How come it's like this?

194
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,430
The Magic Star actually is being used to refine the Bloody Pool?!

195
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,780
What's wrong with you, Xiong Fei?

196
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,710
Be careful!

197
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,700
Never thought...

198
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,210
Gong Zi Xu.

199
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,660
Never thought that there'd be a person who can get the Magic Star as easily as that.

200
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,760
Why are you here?

201
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,600
Give the Magic Star to me.

202
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,980
It doesn't belong to you two.

203
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,230
It belongs to me.

204
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,860
It belongs to the Demon King!

205
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,530
How come I feel that this thing in his head is not that friendly.

206
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,750
My Illuminati's three elders.

207
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,780
Oldest Elder Chang Ming

208
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,030
has long gave up all his sect responsibilities

209
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,440
and went into the path of cultivation.

210
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,330
He already has no power to interfere with Illuminati matters.

211
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,490
Elder Zhao Ran willfully changed the sect's rules and

212
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,680
went against the sacred laws of the Three Gods of Illumination.

213
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,340
Elder Jiong Ye got tricked by an evil person

214
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,410
who blurred his consciousness.

215
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,830
Then it is just natural that the person who should be the main authority in the Illuminati

216
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,270
is me, the Leader of Red Clothed,

217
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,590
Gong Zi Xu!

218
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,280
That thing in your head...

219
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,840
Demon King's Helmet.

220
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,690
Demon King?

221
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,740
Zhao Ran, you wasted so much effort.

222
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,500
The Magic Star isn't with me.

223
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,850
You can't fool me.

224
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,440
Looks like... you are not really just after the Magic Star.

225
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,160
You also want to take the Star Chart, too.

226
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,500
Only with Star Chart can you find the Magic Stars.

227
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,280
Only by gathering all Magic Stars

228
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,650
can you activate the helmet's power.

229
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,800
You indeed are a Heaven Strategy Envoy.

230
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,930
You know the special properties of Magics Stars more than anyone else.

231
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,130
But when you arrived here at the labyrinth,

232
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,690
the Magic Star was indeed with me.

233
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,000
But right now, it's not with me anymore.

234
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,170
A Ji Ya, this child, thinks deeper than anyone.

235
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,800
She was able to follow the directions on the Star Chart up to this mountain.

236
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,400
it shows she has never forgotten the Hanyu Code I taught her

237
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,700
when I played with her when she was younger.

238
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,200
After all, A Ji Ya is a kind child.

239
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,400
And you, Zhao Ran, killed Elder Chang Ming.

240
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,150
You learned the Diablo Scriptures.

241
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,100
You are no longer a human!

242
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,700
You dare use such underhanded tricks to lie to me!

243
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,960
Playing magic tricks is my best skills.

244
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,000
It is mainly used to entertain people.

245
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Elder Zhao Ran, how do you feel today?

246
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,180
Even if it is like this, the Magic Star won't leave the Illuminati!

247
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,300
However, next year on this day, it'll be your death anniversary!

248
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,200
My death anniversary? It should be our death anniversary!

249
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,200
Master, the Illuminati and the Demon World are complete opposites!

250
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,600
How can you wear the helmet of the Demon King?

251
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,300
This kind of evil item, how can it be hidden within the Illuminati?

252
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
His mind has already been bewitched by the Demon King's Helmet.

253
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,000
Today, all of you

254
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,200
have to bow before my feet!

255
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
Hold this well.

256
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,700
Xiong Fei!

257
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,600
Xiong Fei!

258
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,990
Gong Zi Xu, wake up!

259
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,500
Zi Su!

260
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,900
- A demon exterminator?<br>- Xiong Fei...

261
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,800
Mister, since the Illuminati had been guarding this place,

262
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,400
no one is allowed to have any aspirations towards the Demon world!

263
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,750
You are a member of the Illuminati!

264
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,600
Have you forgotten that?

265
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,390
<i>I've always respected the Illuminati since young.</i>

266
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,200
<i>Every day I work hard for them.</i>

267
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,700
<i>I worked for Zhao Ran without ever complaining about it.</i>

268
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,600
<i>They have actually killed my beloved A Ji Ya!</i>

269
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,000
<i>Only when I have all the highest power in the world, the power of the Magic Stars,</i>

270
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
<i>can I make the people who hurt me pay!</i>

271
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,970
It is time to fight now.

272
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,000
It is time to take revenge for A Ji Ya.

273
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,800
Zi Su!

274
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,580
I will take revenge for A Ji Ya.

275
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,700
Give me your life!

276
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,550
Are you okay?

277
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,900
I'm fine.

278
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,100
Why? Why?

279
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,500
How is this possible? This is impossible!

280
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,000
Go away!

281
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,900
I want to kill them to take revenge for A Ji Ya!

282
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,600
Let's go.

283
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,080
What do we do?

284
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,500
Zhan Xiong Fei, are Chong Yun and the others... already dead?

285
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,780
What should we do now?

286
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,350
This thing... shouldn't be kept here.

287
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:05,980
KoreanDramaX.co

288
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,400
This passage, how can it have such a place?

289
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,000
Jiong Ye, you come out right now!

290
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,400
Where have you hidden the Magic Star?

291
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
A Ji Ya...

292
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:05,120
Zhan Xiong Fei, do you think we will die here today?

293
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,480
It will be fine.

294
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,520
Don't worry.

295
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,200
I will look after you.

296
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,690
Lord Ma, it must have been a tiring journey.

297
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,200
Have some water.

298
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,900
Lord,

299
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,500
why will the Illuminati, an organization that claims to be leak proof,

300
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,600
suddenly sell us information regarding the Magic Stars?

301
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,800
Actually, there is no place that doesn't leak water.

302
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
As long as there is hard currency,

303
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,300
any place will start leaking.

304
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,600
I'm close to the Red Clothed left hand envoy of the Illuminati, Ah Ning.

305
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,200
He says, as long as you are willing to bring manpower to

306
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,000
help him to become an elder,

307
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,600
then the Magic Stars in his hands will all be given to you.

308
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,110
Cut the crap.

309
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,800
Let's all go up to the mountain.

310
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,690
You... have to go with me as well.

311
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,300
You are going up there dressed like that.

312
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,300
I fear it will be inconvenient.

313
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,150
Men!

314
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,600
Take him down now!

315
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,680
Why are you still standing there?

316
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,600
Left Hand Envoy Ah Ning and Elder Zhao Ran,

317
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,800
willfully changed the sect's rules,

318
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,600
broke the sacred laws of the Three Gods,

319
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,000
and plotted to change the sect's direction and have ulterior motives.

320
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,700
I, Gong Zi Xu, today in the name of the Illuminati,

321
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,400
will clear the sect of evil!

322
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,900
All you red-clothed soldiers listen!

323
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,900
While Elder Zhao Ran sat in the leadership position,

324
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,600
he has done too many despicable deeds.

325
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,000
He defamed our sect and disgraced the Three Gods,

326
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,800
but today, his whereabouts are unknown. He went missing.

327
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,000
Our Illuminati cannot be without a leader for a day.

328
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,300
So I will take over his place as Elder!

329
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,000
No way. No way. No way.

330
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,760
Elder Zhao Ran clearly was inside that labyrinth.

331
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,000
How can you say he is not here?

332
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,010
Who else has any complaints?

333
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:19,700
We support Gong Zi Xu to lead the Illuminati!

334
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,890
Let's go.

335
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,680
Where are you going?

336
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,500
Hey! Bai Ze, are you alright?

337
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,790
Where are you going, Bai Ze?

338
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,260
Bai Ze!

339
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,030
- Are you alright?<br>- I'm fine.

340
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,470
This must be the Thousand Return Door.

341
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,700
It should be.

342
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,240
This is the place that your father entered.

343
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,710
But where is your father?

344
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,170
And Elder Zhao Ran?

345
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,830
Where are they?

346
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,330
There seemed to be people who have came here but have already left.

347
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,140
Let's just go inside and take a look.

348
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,420
Let's go.

349
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,710
This... Isn't this the room earlier?

350
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,930
How come it's so strange here?

351
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,840
Let's take a look again.

352
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,990
We're back again!

353
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,100
What ghostly place is this?!

354
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,020
How come it's like a maze?

355
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,580
No. No. No. Let's take a rest for a while.

356
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,000
What do we do?

357
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,080
We've been encircling for a long time and haven't found anything.

358
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,090
Zhan Xiong Fei, I'm so hungry.

359
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,880
If this continues,

360
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,780
will we starve to death here?

361
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,140
I don't want to. I don't want to.

362
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,210
We won't starve to death.

363
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,330
We won't. Don't worry.

364
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,950
Even if we really are unable to get out,

365
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,830
don't forget, I am the Illuminati's Young Master.

366
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,630
They will surely come here to save me.

367
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,010
Although they don't recognize me as such,

368
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,290
they still wouldn't be ruthless to allow a flower to be destroyed, right?

369
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,280
What situation has it been already and you're still making jokes.

370
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,100
Don't worry.

371
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,240
With me around, I definitely won't let you be in danger.

372
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,540
Bluff. Just continue bluffing, Zhan Xiong Fei.

373
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,140
I am telling the truth.

374
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,440
Even if I have to risk my life, I won't let you be hurt.

375
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,340
I don't believe.

376
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,260
Hey, oh, right. Zi Su, last time, I wasn't able to tell you

377
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,880
that my astrological sign is your sign's guardian angel.

378
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,380
I am not listening to your nonsense anymore.

379
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,500
Just continue making up things everyday.

380
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,060
Zi Su...

381
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,670
If... I said if...

382
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,750
If what?

383
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,620
If... the two of us really got stuck here and can't go out forever,

384
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,560
what would you do?

385
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,830
Stuck here forever?

386
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,290
Won't that be so boring?

387
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,370
How can it be boring?

388
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,340
I will surely do magic tricks to make you laugh.

389
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,790
And also, we surely would have a lot of words which we wouldn't be able to run out.

390
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,280
It won't be boring.

391
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,150
But this place is not as fun as the one outside.

392
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,080
The outside world is so wonderful.

393
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,020
There are so much delicious food.

394
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,320
What good is there in here?

395
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,760
What's the difference of me being locked up inside the palace?

396
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,880
It wasn't easy for me to be able to get out of the palace.

397
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,450
I don't want to be trapped in here.

398
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,040
The difference with that of the palace is it's so huge, okay?

399
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,190
I'm not inside the palace.

400
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:12,770
Then does it mean... you are quite willing to get trapped here with me?

401
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,450
You... if you are not willing, then I'm not willing, either.

402
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,070
If you are willing, I will then be willing.

403
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:34,200
KoreanDramaX.co

404
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,990
Stop! Who are you?!

405
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,520
Stop.

406
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,710
<i>[Left Hand Envoy Ah Ning's seal]</i>

407
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,650
Left Hand Envoy Ah Ning's seal?

408
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,230
It's good that you know it.

409
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,890
After seeing Left Hand Envoy Ah Ning's seal, aren't you still going to make way?

410
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,270
Lord Gong Zi has ordered that Left Hand Envoy Ah Ning betrayed the sect.

411
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,290
We are cleaning the sect of all traitors right now.

412
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,770
All men of Ah Ning must be killed.

413
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,560
- What's going on?!<br>- I don't know, either.

414
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,020
There must be some misunderstandings behind this.

415
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,920
This is called a misunderstanding?!

416
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,740
Are you Ah Ning?

417
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,710
Creating such a mess and causing me to lose men. Is that okay?

418
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,520
Ah Ning is already dead!

419
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,210
Okay. Then you are making a deal with me in place of him, am I right?

420
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,610
Stop touching me.

421
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,950
I'll get back to you later.

422
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,030
Men! Take this mob down!

423
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,540
Wait!

424
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,920
We still haven't talked about the price so why are we fighting again?

425
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,570
Lord, he is not with Left Hand Envoy Ah Ning.

426
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,980
What? Why didn't you say so earlier?

427
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,060
What are you still standing there for?

428
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,040
Attack!

429
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,060
Zhao Ran?

430
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,150
What is that?

431
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,270
Is it the Magic Star?

432
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,840
Hurry and give it to me!

433
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,700
I told you. I won't let you get out of this maze.

434
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,000
What really is this thing?

435
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,730
What is this place?

436
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,250
What are you panicking about?

437
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:47,150
I can be benevolent and tell you that this is a toy box.

438
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,260
This toy box is the ultimate secret key of this Thousand Return Door.

439
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,900
In it is the whole labyrinth including all of us in here.

440
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,390
What I will be doing now is to

441
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:03,210
remove everyone else in this maze and just leave us two here.

442
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,020
And then... destroy it.

443
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,100
Stop day dreaming already.

444
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,750
Stop using child's play to trick me.

445
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,320
Do you believe that I will destroy this?

446
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,610
Then destroy it now!

447
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,160
I surely will!

448
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,090
Let's go.

449
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,780
Father! You are indeed in here!

450
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,100
Are you alright?! Father...

451
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,830
Zhao Ran, you dare bully my father?!

452
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,770
Look at my skills!

453
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,220
- Xiong Fei!<br><i>- Child...</i>

454
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,630
- Are you alright?<br><i>- Of course, I'm fine.</i>

455
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:32,110
<i>♫ How long can my friends around me to accompany me? ♫</i>

456
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:38,280
<i>♫ I’m tired of hearing those comforting words ♫</i>

457
