00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:23,973
I think it's good that I get to live with my friends.

176
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,345
Isn't this everyone's first time using bunk beds?

177
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:35,737
Everyone is musicians are here.

178
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:41,379
I think we were able to tell each other and ask questions

179
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,500
about how we could improve anything musically.

180
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,838
Ye-rin. I don't know how many rooms she has in her heart.

181
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,568
She began as a singer-songwriter.

182
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:56,500
And as we went on she is now almost like a performance singer.

183
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,770
Her spectrum is so wide.

184
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:01,872
What will be added this time?

185
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:06,480
She is the contestant with the most of everything. She has many charms.

186
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:11,669
[The charming Woo Ye-rin, her song selection is revealed]

187
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:19,568
If she makes this a fast one it'll be a hit.

188
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:26,176
I think it'll be another surprise if she can maintain the fast tempo of the song.

189
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,109
[Woo Ye-rin's selection Kim Gun-mo's "A sleepless night and it rains"]

[The million seller Kim Gun-mo's 1st album title song]

191
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:38,906
I organized the stage so that

192
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:44,345
it'll be rhythmical and fun for everyone. Almost like a musical.

193
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:52,737
I heard that you had a special reason to come all the way to TOP 6.

194
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,379
I had a dream and-

195
00:13:59,244 --> 00:14:01,311
you know the 12 Chinese zodiac animals.

196
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:09,041
My house's veranda was filled with them bouncing in a very cute way.

197
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,906
But I opened the door and hugged the pig like this.

198
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:17,278
People would usually buy a lottery with that kind of a dream.

199
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,500
If I buy the lottery,

200
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:23,669
the luck might not come to me being here.

201
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:24,804
Yeah.

202
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:29,872
There may have been luck and other things too

203
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:33,413
but people acknowledged my talent.

204
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,601
I think I'm more confident now.

207
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:30,906
When I look out the window it rains.

208
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:36,007
It makes me sad for no reason.

209
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:42,601
I can't comfort my sadness

210
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:47,142
on a night I can't fall asleep either.

211
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:54,601
In my faint memory you become distant more and more

212
00:15:54,703 --> 00:16:00,804
and only your sad smile remains in my heart and flows.

213
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,413
On a rainy night you make me even sadder.

214
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:12,007
The song I used to listen to lingers around my ears.

215
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:17,568
On a night when it would rain like this at night,

216
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:23,311
I meet you with my weariness of missing you.

217
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:28,872
When this rain stops,

218
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:34,534
I'm going to leave to find you.

219
00:16:57,109 --> 00:17:00,311
I don't want to listen to sad songs.

220
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:07,703
You who have been asleep in my heart finds me again.

221
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:14,210
On a night when it would rain like this at night,

222
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:20,176
I meet you with my weariness of missing you.

223
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:25,635

00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:30,669
I'm going to leave to find you.

Thank you.

Number 1 Woo Ye-rin, everyone.

228
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:53,568
It was a great performance much like a musical.

229
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,534
Please come to the center.

230
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,635
We'll hear from the judges the score and the feedback.

231
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:00,176
First

232
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:02,278
yes Mr. Yoo.

233
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:08,703
We're always able to see various things in Ye-rin's stage.

234
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:15,379
You incorporated "Singing in the rain" in the intro, and it suited this song.

235
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:19,940
And you showed us a various rearrangements of the rhythms towards the end.

236
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:25,568
I think we were able to see a little bit of Ye-rin's rearrangement abilities.

237
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:29,568
But one thing I'm a little worried about is that

238
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:37,109
I think you were missing a little bit of that "taste" of the song.

239
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:40,804
Because you were trying to show a wide array of music styles

240
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:45,635
it may have been great as a performance but its completion may be lacking

241
00:18:45,737 --> 00:18:48,109
because it had too many components to it.

242
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:50,804
I think it had both its positives and negatives.

243
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:52,447
Okay. Antenna's score is

244
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,041
Okay. Antenna's score is

245
00:18:54,345 --> 00:18:55,447
out of 100,

246
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,973
91!

247
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,703
It's a high score. This is good.

248
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:04,075
Next judge please.

249
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,176
Yes Mr. Yang.

250
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:11,770
Because this is the first live show,

251
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:17,737
in the last 6 months we had many opportunities to see Ye-rin's vocals

252
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:22,311
but watching her today with the band and the viewers,

253
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:28,311
I think she was trying to show her other sides more than her vocals.

254
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:33,447
Honestly I wasn't trying to see whether she was good at singing or not.

255
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:36,480
I was trying to see how comfortable and natural she will be.

256
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,669
It makes me wonder if the other contestants will be as natural as her.

257
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,379
You looked really comfortable.

258
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,075
You didn't look awkward at all.

259
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:49,447
I want to praise you on that.

260
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:50,568
Good job. Thank you.

261
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:51,703
Thank you.

262
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:53,838
She seemed natural and comfortable.

263
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:55,480
YG's score is-

264
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,041
YG's score is-

265
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:00,244

266
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:01,311

267
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:03,635
Alright.

268
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,635
Mr. Park?

269
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,568
If you're on a stage like this,

270
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:11,601
and stand in front of this many crowd

271
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,210
for a person without experience, I mean, she's still an amateur.

272
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:19,244
I think people need to consider how nervous she would be.

273
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:24,311
2 things come up when one is nervous. The first is

274
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:25,770
you tighten up.

275
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,906
And secondly air begins to disappear from your voice.

276
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:31,940
It's been a while since we heard that.

277
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:37,480
She actually had an excellent vocalization skills before but today

278
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:41,480
because you were nervous your voice was too thin and sharp.

279
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,635
And you were certainly tightened up because of your nervousness.

280
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:47,210
And so

281
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:49,737
unlike Hyun-suk,

282
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:51,906
I saw you be more nervous.

283
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:54,838
So honestly I didn't get to see you take control of the song

284
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:58,703
or enjoy the song both vocally and performance wise.

285
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:01,210
So I thought it could've been better.

286
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:04,906
But I think it's such a big stage, you can't help but to do that.

287

I felt like I'm being comforted after hearing it once.

314
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:51,142
I think I chose it because I wanted to be the one to comfort people

but I know

350
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:18,804
that your day was so difficult that you couldn't even let out a little sigh.

351
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:24,568
Don't think about anything else now.

352
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,413
Try to take a deep breath

353
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:32,804
and breathe out.

354
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:37,804
Someone's sigh,

355
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:41,500
that heavy sigh.

356
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:49,278
How could I ever understand that?

357
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:52,973
Your sigh.

358
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,075
I probably won't be able to understand its depth but

359
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,311
it's okay.

360
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:04,635
I'll give you a hug.

361
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:20,210
You worked so hard.

362
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:32,447
Number 2 Lee Si-eun everyone.

363
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,379
I think she showed all the high notes that she's got.

364
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:39,007
What did the judges think of her performance?

365
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:43,635
Many of her fans are here today too.

366
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:47,311
Mr. Yoo would you like to go first?

367
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,500
My hearts beating really fast right now.

368
00:27:54,142 --> 00:28:01,703
I think it's been a while since I felt so full in my heart seeing a contestant.

369
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:09,669
She suffered the most difficulties last season.

370
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:13,345
But as she moves up more and more I think Si-eun, so-

371
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:18,278
I think it's really scary how you don't falter if you're just good at the basics.

372
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:24,041
This time too, this is actually a very difficult song to sing. Especially here.

373
00:28:24,075 --> 00:28:26,601
You really have to compete just with your voice.

374
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:29,447
You have no performance or other things to rely on.

375
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:34,601
That power you have to fill this place with just your voice and to break through

376
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:39,041
I really felt that you're incredible through this song.

377
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,480
Antenna's score is-

378
00:28:40,737 --> 00:28:44,601
He said that she were incredible. The score?

379
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:47,447
96!

380
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:50,379
It's a very high score.

381
00:28:52,568 --> 00:28:53,973
Next judge?

382
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,413
Mr. Park is getting ready to speak.

383
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:04,176
I think you need to consider 2 things when hearing someone sing. How good are they,

384
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:05,311
and secondly

385
00:29:05,838 --> 00:29:08,244
how original are they? How do they sing differently?

386
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:10,176
You have to consider them both.

387
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,872
If you ask how good you are at singing you're amazing.

388
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:18,075
You're, you're really good.

389
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:23,804
But last time when you sang "beautiful farewell," for the first time I

390
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:31,500
I was able to see how you look inside for the first time in your song.

391
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,804
So not your looks but

392
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:36,176
your mind and your heart.

393
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:39,447
I think I was able to see for the first time what kind of a person you were but

394
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:44,737
you weren't tense then and I felt like it originated from the inside.

395
00:29:44,737 --> 00:29:49,940
When you sing without the pressure to sing well.

396
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:52,534
But when you were singing the beginning part today

397
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:55,534
it was better than when you were singing "Beautiful farewell."

398
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:57,379
You were even more relaxed.

399
00:29:58,737 --> 00:29:59,737
So now

400
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:03,447
now I finally see what you look like

401
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,872
what your soul looks like but

402
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,703
to me I felt like you returned to your usual self when you sang the high notes.

403
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:14,447
You tightened up again.

404
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:18,311
You sang well but you were tensed up,

405
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:21,568
I didn't feel like you were singing from your soul.

406
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:26,142
So I actually liked the verse, before you hit the high notes, better.

407
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:31,244
So today it's about half and half of the feedback I've given you.

408
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,041
The beginning was really good

409
00:30:33,176 --> 00:30:34,278
it was the best part.

410
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:37,568
The latter high notes, although you sang really well,

411
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,075
I felt like I didn't feel any soul.

412
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,345
That's what I felt.

413
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:43,379
JYP's score is

414
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:47,480
We're very curious of the score, half praise and half criticisms.

415
00:30:47,737 --> 00:30:50,210
JYP's score is 87!

416
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:53,973
Mr. Yang?

417
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,872
Lee Si-eun and Park Jin-young's love-hate relationship quite something to watch.

418
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:06,635
They almost remind me of two people having a thing.

419
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:11,568
As Park Jin-young said, it's about how well you sing and how original you sing.

420
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:15,669
Park Jin-young's feedback and mine are pretty split today.

421
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:17,872
First, you sang well.

422
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,703
For the first part.

423
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:23,601
And to me, it felt original.

424
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:30,480
Because Lee Hi's voice is the opposite from Lee Si-eun's

425
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,568
so you couldn't sing the same way even if she wanted to.

426
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,109
When I first heard Lee Si-eun's "sigh"

427
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:40,703
I did end up sighing.

428
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:42,176
A sigh of relief.

429
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:51,413
When contestants sing Jin-young's song I usually compliment them a lot.

430
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:55,210
But you don't compliment them when they sing YG songs.

431
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,480
I think there might be a personal reason with his feedback.

432
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,244
I erased the score and gave you a little more.

433
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:02,635
YG's score is

434
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:04,244
YG's score is

435
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:08,007
It probably has nothing to do with it. It was a joke.

436
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,906
95!

437
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,345
Score of 278.

438
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:13,838
[Lee Si-eun total 278]

439
00:32:13,872 --> 00:32:15,075
It's a high score.

440
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:17,838
Those of you viewers who support Lee Si-eun,

441
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:22,669
text number 2 or Lee Si-eun to #0606.

442
00:32:22,804 --> 00:32:25,041
Number 2 Lee Si-eun everyone!

443
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:34,413
I should be feeling good about going to TOP 6

444
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:39,007
but because I made it to TOP 6 after not doing so well,

445
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:45,534
[Yoo Jay sang "I want to fall in love" during the TOP 8 round]

446
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,703
You lacked focus.

447
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,244
You have to focus.

448
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:54,838
After I heard the feedback

449
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:59,007
I thought a lot about which song to sing.

450
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:02,872
I have to choose a song that I can really focus on.

451
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:07,940
So I chose a song that I can really sing and have fun.

452
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:10,770
[Which song did she choose for the first live show?]

453

454
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,737
I already want to hear it.

455
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:23,345
This is a song that Jay can extract all of her soulful potentials.

456
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:25,345
I'm looking very forward to it personally.

457
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:28,872
[First day of practice!]

458
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:33,075
Faster faster.

00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:37,872
[She's more into rearrangements than she was before]

460
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:40,041
I'll put in the scat here.

461
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:47,838
I want to show myself having fun singing and dancing this time.

Are you practicing today?

467
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:04,447
No. I'm in the dorms.

468
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:06,278
You're in the dorms right now?

469
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,075
Yeah.

470
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:07,703
Jay.

471
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:08,703
Yeah?

472
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:16,007
I miss you.

473
00:34:16,109 --> 00:34:17,635
I miss you and

474
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,669
I'm proud of you.

475
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:25,142
You said before that you were scared.

476
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:28,007
You said you were scared of the live shows. Are you not scared anymore?

477
00:34:28,176 --> 00:34:33,447
I thought I would be less nervous if there were more people.

478
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:35,075
But I made too many mistakes.

479
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,007
Are you worried that you'll get nervous?

480
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,940
I don't know.

[She's worried to think she'll be singing in front of thousands of people]

482
00:34:44,737 --> 00:34:48,210
What I'm looking forward to from your stage this time

483
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,413
is that you'd naturally show the real you while you're on stage.

484
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:58,447
Jay you can do it!

485

[She was very encouraged by her family's genuine support]

486
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,973
There will be a lot of people

487
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:13,669
but I'm going to just brainwash myself.

488
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:15,770
"It'll be fun it'll be fun."

489
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,770

Yoo Jay's very soulful stage.

493
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,906
There were some performances in the middle too.

494
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:40,940
It looks like the judges might have different opinions from one another.

495
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:43,109
Mr. Park Jin-young first please.

496
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:46,838
As I've said before

497
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:51,804
in many other jobs you have to be in your right mind,

498
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:55,210
but it's not right for a singer to be in their right mind while they work.

499
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:59,737
But during the entire performance you looked like you were in your right mind.

500
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:03,601
You have to really lose yourself.

501
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:05,534
You

502
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:10,007
you really have to lose your mind to the music and your body, especially for this song

503
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,568
these are the kind of songs that you play piano with your feet and things like that.

504
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,838
I'm very disappointed that you sang a song like this

505
00:39:19,872 --> 00:39:21,447
so calmly with the right mind.

506
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,872
It could've been the song that you just let go of yourself and go crazy.

507
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,601
I think I was looking forward to that.

508
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,568
But since you are still young and this is a big stage

509
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,872
you can't help but to get nervous.

510
00:39:32,973 --> 00:39:36,210
You're the youngest right now out of all TOP 6.

511
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:38,176
You couldn't help it I think.

512
00:39:38,278 --> 00:39:39,278
JYP's score is-

513
00:39:39,973 --> 00:39:43,109
She probably did get nervous since this was her first live show.

514
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:44,379
JYP's score is?

515
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:45,940
86!

516
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:50,906
It's not easy to get above 90 from Park Jin-young.

Who's next?

518
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:56,601
For the first time today Park Jin-young and I agree.

519
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:00,447
I'm disappointed too.

520
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:05,379
Because I know Yoo Jay has this massive power in her voice

521
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:12,534
but she chose the genre that she's not able to do well instead to have fun on stage.

522
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:15,940
You didn't have fun though, first of all.

523
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:20,007
Park Jin-young is honestly not someone with the best vocals,

524
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:21,311
to be honest.

525
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:23,007
You're pointing that out.

526
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:26,278
What I do acknowledge is that he can have fun on stage.

527
00:40:26,413 --> 00:40:30,635
When he's on stage he does his best to have the most fun, I acknowledge that

528
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:38,480
but you didn't play and have fun as much as I had expected you to so I regret that.

529
00:40:38,872 --> 00:40:40,244
YG's score is-

530
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:42,109
They had similar things to say.

531
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:43,534
YG's score is-

532
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,737
She didn't have fun.

533
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,770
85!

534
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:48,176
Great.

535
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,109
Mr. Yoo Hee-yeol?

536
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,311
I still remember the first time I saw you Jay.

537
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:59,447
When I first saw you I thought, this is a little extreme, but you were a monster.

538
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:02,278
You played around with the song all you wanted.

539
00:41:02,278 --> 00:41:08,669
I saw for the first time what we call a gem, a diamond out of them all too.

540
00:41:09,379 --> 00:41:14,601
But as you go forward, you had to be on stage with a lot of pressure,

541
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:18,142
you definitely can't ignore experience either.

542
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:22,534
You were nervous and even were off on some of the notes today

543
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,345
and you were especially very tight in your body.

544
00:41:25,872 --> 00:41:29,413
I think you were the only one nervous on this awesome stage,

545
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:31,872
even the dancers were having fun putting together the stage.

546
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:33,838
But the main role was nervous.

547
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:37,311
We were not able to enjoy the stage to the full extent.

00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:38,635
Antenna's score is-

549
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:42,007

[Kim Ye-rim, Denise Kim, Joyce Lee, Yuyu Liu]

557
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:15,635
I think it's really amazing because

558
00:42:15,737 --> 00:42:20,669
a couple of months ago we didn't know each other at all

559
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,838
Ye-rim from Incheon

560
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:26,804
Joyce is from Houston and Yuyu Liu came from China.

561
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:31,176
No one would've imagined that we would be together.

562
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:36,345
It's really amazing how we didn't have a single fight in the months we were together.

563
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:38,142
But it's really weird.

564
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:42,379
It's because you're good to us.

565
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:50,176
Wait.

566
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:53,210
That's a surprise.

567
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:55,669
She says she already beat us a hundred times in her heart.

568
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:56,703
Wait.

569
00:42:57,635 --> 00:42:58,804
She means this.

570
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:01,278
Really?

571
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,278
When?

572
00:43:07,703 --> 00:43:08,838
"Let's practice."

573
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,007
[They don't have a problem joking around]

574
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:31,973
[They've gotten closer as they were together all the time now]

575
00:43:32,413 --> 00:43:37,872
I'm thankful that I met friends that I feel like I could be friends with forever.

576
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:40,041
I'm thankful.

577
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:46,601
What song did they choose? "She was pretty" last time was a game-changer.

578
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:50,311
It's good.

579
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:54,075
This is good.

580
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:56,244
I think this is going to be great.

581
00:43:56,703 --> 00:43:58,075
It's the best song selection.

582
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,176
[Mazinger S' song Chae-yeon's "Two of us"]

583
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,142
Mazinger S has been strong in pop and soul in the past performances

584
00:44:16,142 --> 00:44:18,872
this song has a strong Korean pop feel.

585
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,210
Despite that,

586
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:23,311
there are many parts in this song they can show their talents in.

587
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:28,075
The strength of being in a team is that the song can be rearranged entirely.

588
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:34,872
We'll have to see how they oriented this song to be rearranged.

589
00:44:36,142 --> 00:44:37,669
Here here here stay still.

590

You have to first be relaxed to be able to

let your soul, what's inside of you dance but if your body's tense

00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,379
97!

648
00:49:42,737 --> 00:49:45,109
It's a good start. Yes alright.

649
00:49:45,568 --> 00:49:48,142
Let us hear from other judges.

650
00:49:49,635 --> 00:49:50,635
Usually

651
00:49:51,413 --> 00:49:56,109
it takes years for girl groups to practice and prepare.

652
00:49:56,568 --> 00:49:57,703
To come up with something.

653
00:49:57,737 --> 00:50:03,838
This team came from all over the place and it's only been months since they practiced.

654
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,109
But they're better than girls groups that's been practicing for years.

655
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:10,176
Even vocals aside, they play so well on stage.

656
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:12,770
And some of these girls have never danced before.

657
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,142
To me the most surprising aspect about Mazinger S is

658
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:18,311
their effort.

659
00:50:18,345 --> 00:50:19,379
Antenna's score is-

660
00:50:19,379 --> 00:50:20,804
Antenna's score-

661
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,447
He said that they were better than most other girl groups.

662
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:27,278

00:50:28,075 --> 00:50:29,906

Mr. Yang?

665
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:36,601
If I were told to praise Mazinger S

666
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:39,075
I think I can go on for about 2 hours.

667
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,838

668
00:50:43,278 --> 00:50:44,568

They keep telling me to end it quick.

670
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:48,345
It'd be beneficial for you to save that time too.

671
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:49,345
Right?

672
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:52,345

673
00:50:52,872 --> 00:50:56,770
Yuyu Liu had a mistake in the middle.

674
00:50:57,244 --> 00:50:59,737
She made a mistake because it was a Korean lyric.

675
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,413
You can make mistakes like that a hundred times and you're fine.

676
00:51:02,534 --> 00:51:04,413
If you can put on this kind of performance.

677
00:51:04,635 --> 00:51:06,872

Soo-Jung your song choice today was very successful.

782
00:59:29,176 --> 00:59:35,210
Because Park Jin-young and I love R&B singers being able to sing Korean pop well

783
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:39,872
because the Korean and the R&B sentiments coexist together.

796

Where do I start- first!

801
01:00:30,075 --> 01:00:34,447
There were 2 changes for Soo-Jung from the start of K-pop star to now.

802
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:35,447
The first is

803
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:37,142
she's a lot brighter.

804
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:40,500

806

I heard for the first time a very open sound.

807
01:00:46,007 --> 01:00:49,906
But this happened during the K-pop star season.

808
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:54,413
And I- what I was talking about before about not being original was that

809
01:00:54,601 --> 01:00:59,737
is if I ask you to sing again will you sing the same way or different?

810
01:01:00,109 --> 01:01:03,804
I think Soo-Jung will sing in 10 different ways if I make her sing 10 times.

811
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:06,480
These changes are not calculated.

812
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:08,872
They're very spontaneous.

813
01:01:09,447 --> 01:01:13,244

814
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:15,568

816

817

818
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:31,244

If Spring comes to us,

874
01:06:16,311 --> 01:06:20,345
if the warm sky surrounds us

875
01:06:20,345 --> 01:06:24,041
if that day comes,

876
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,737
I'm going to lay on your knees and dream.

877
01:06:30,534 --> 01:06:36,447
If the people who are indulged in the darkness (lose their mind one by one)

878
01:06:40,075 --> 01:06:46,278
If the tears you've shed all night (combine to become the ocean)

879
01:06:48,669 --> 01:06:54,075
Everyone say hooray! when the butterflies come.

880
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:59,007
When the buds of flowers sheepishly open the door for you,

881
01:06:59,007 --> 01:07:03,568
say hooray! when your tears melt away.

882
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:06,345
Hold each other's hands.

883
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:10,635
If Spring comes.

884
01:07:28,906 --> 01:07:34,311
Everyone say hooray! When the forest awakens,

885
01:07:34,379 --> 01:07:39,109
When the cold gray world wears the colorful clothes.

886
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:43,940
Say hooray! when the ice begins to crack.

887
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:46,210
Hold each other's hands

888
01:07:46,278 --> 01:07:48,480
Hold each other's hands.

889
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,379
Say Hooray!

890
01:07:55,669 --> 01:07:58,041
Tickles your nose.

891
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:03,480
Say hooray! if the winter's all passed.

892
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:08,703
If Spring comes.

893
01:08:29,345 --> 01:08:31,568
Number 6 Ahn Ye-eun everyone!

894
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:37,007
Ye-eun has brought another song that's entirely different.

895
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,480
Alright.

896
01:08:39,568 --> 01:08:41,176
We'll hear from the judges.

897
01:08:41,176 --> 01:08:42,311
Mr. Yoo Hee-yeol?

898
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:45,534
This song is different again.

899
01:08:45,534 --> 01:08:48,413
It's different from the songs you've been singing.

900
01:08:48,534 --> 01:08:52,737
The lyric is a lot heavier than the ones you've been writing.

901
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:57,075
It's heavy but it carried a significant message.

902
01:08:57,601 --> 01:09:04,041
What was interesting was I think you used a vocoder for a solo part.

903
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:07,804
You have a very good rearrangement skill.

904
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:10,244
And it was a song with a simple theme

905
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:12,007
if we're talking about the organization of the song.

906
01:09:12,007 --> 01:09:17,142
But you took that and made it in many variations

907
01:09:17,345 --> 01:09:20,906
it was almost like you were shouting into our hearts.

908
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:24,906
So if this was a festival full of your fans,

909
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:27,838
they may have jumped to your song.

910
01:09:28,568 --> 01:09:31,838
I think I was able to feel that spring has come, like the message of your song.

911
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:32,906
Antenna's score is-

912
01:09:32,906 --> 01:09:34,447
Antenna's score is.

913
01:09:35,534 --> 01:09:38,142
Ye-eun brought a self-written song with a very different feel.

914
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,007
93!

915
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,075
Good.

916
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:42,635
Who's next?

917
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:44,109
Park Jin-young.

918
01:09:45,872 --> 01:09:46,906
I-

919
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,500
always say

920
01:09:48,534 --> 01:09:50,635
that I want to meet a musician with a soul

921
01:09:50,635 --> 01:09:53,737
but I'm not talking about the African American music soul.

922
01:09:55,669 --> 01:10:01,635
Everyone has a part that cannot be seen to the eye, the inner part.

923
01:10:02,311 --> 01:10:05,804
It's the matter of how much that aspect is laid out in the song.

924
01:10:06,534 --> 01:10:12,480
If you define soul that way I think Ye-eun is over-flowing with soul.

925
01:10:15,109 --> 01:10:16,109
In the lyrics,

926
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:19,041
In the lyrics, melody, rearrangements, the vocals,

927
01:10:19,109 --> 01:10:22,804
I feel like your mind is all in there.

928
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,804
I can feel that.

929
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:26,770
And

930
01:10:26,872 --> 01:10:30,041
you wrote the song with the idea of light and darkness.

931
01:10:31,635 --> 01:10:36,379
I think you were able to write songs like this because you're beginning to be loved

932
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:39,906
because you said if spring comes you'll give the light,

933
01:10:40,872 --> 01:10:44,770
it sounds like there is no light in the person, you have to receive it.

934
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:47,770
If you look at the moon at light it looks like it's shining but it has no light.

935
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,737
It's receiving the light from the sun.

936
01:10:49,737 --> 01:10:51,838
In the same way, you're receiving all the love

937
01:10:51,838 --> 01:10:55,109
now you're able to have a heart to give the love too.

938
01:10:55,244 --> 01:10:57,311
I enjoyed it. JYP's score is-

939
01:10:58,447 --> 01:11:01,635
He compared Ye-eun to the stars.

940
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:02,770
The score is?

941
01:11:03,244 --> 01:11:04,244
98!

942
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:07,311
Alright. We'll hear from Mr. Yang Hyun-Suk.

943
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:17,447
Every time I see Ye-eun I think

944
01:11:18,413 --> 01:11:21,669
"Could Ye-eun be here right now?"

945
01:11:22,906 --> 01:11:27,345
I think maybe she's a contestant that's too good to be here.

946
01:11:28,635 --> 01:11:33,703
And do I have the qualifications to judge this person?

947
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:35,041
I also think that.

948
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:39,075
She's not a contestant that's here to become a singer.

949
01:11:39,142 --> 01:11:41,737
You already look like a complete artist.

950
01:11:42,311 --> 01:11:44,804
I'm sorry to even give you a score from me.

951
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:46,109
YG's score is-

952
01:11:46,244 --> 01:11:49,075
He says that she's a complete artist.

953
01:11:49,447 --> 01:11:50,872
YG's score is?

954
01:11:52,176 --> 01:11:53,176
95!

955
01:11:54,379 --> 01:11:57,278
A total score of 286. It's a high score.

956
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,601
If you're supporting Ahn Ye-eun,

957
01:11:59,601 --> 01:12:03,940
please text number 6 or Ahn Ye-eun to #0606.

01:17:39,176 --> 01:17:43,804
I was able to experience some valuable things that I will never get to experience here

1050
01:17:44,007 --> 01:17:45,075
I'm really glad.

1051
01:17:45,413 --> 01:17:46,534
And I met-

1052
01:17:46,872 --> 01:17:48,142
Thank you.

1053
01:17:48,176 --> 01:17:53,601
I met really good friends so I'm happy.

1054
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:54,973
Thank you for everything.

1055
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,480
Thank you.

1056
01:17:57,669 --> 01:18:02,041
Yoo Jay has become a hot topic throughout her time here but this was her last stage.

1057
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,770
Can you tell us how you feel?

1058
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:07,940
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

1059
01:18:08,872 --> 01:18:12,041
I thank the writers

1060
01:18:12,075 --> 01:18:17,075
I thank the judges and thank you for letting me meet good friends.

1061
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:20,109
Thank you.

1062
01:18:21,176 --> 01:18:24,568
Please say a few words to them. They've worked so hard.

1063
01:18:24,568 --> 01:18:26,345
Mr. Park can you represent the judges?

1064
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:28,500
Both of the contestants

1065
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,703
have surprised all of the judges very much.

1066
01:18:31,703 --> 01:18:35,210
I look forward to their future.

1067
01:18:35,838 --> 01:18:42,176
I think for Ye-rin she was able to learn more about herself during her time here.

1068
01:18:42,311 --> 01:18:46,703
And I think Jay is only eliminated because she's still young and without experience.

1069
01:18:46,703 --> 01:18:50,210
After gaining some experience you'll become a great singer.

1070
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:52,413
You two worked so hard to get here and

1071
01:18:52,413 --> 01:18:53,838
I'm really proud.

1072
01:18:55,345 --> 01:18:58,480
This is how difficult K-pop star is.

1073
01:18:58,838 --> 01:19:03,007
This is very surprising. Yoo Jay and Woo Ye-rin has been eliminated.

1074
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:07,804
With that news, we'll come back next week with K-pop star TOP 4 stages.

1075
01:19:07,872 --> 01:19:10,973
Survival audition K-pop star season 5! Thank you!
