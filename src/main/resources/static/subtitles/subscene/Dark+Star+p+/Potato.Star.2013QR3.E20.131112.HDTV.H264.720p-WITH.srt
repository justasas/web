1
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,170
I really couldn't even have imagined that 
it would end up like this. Really!

2
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,370
Then, what are we going to do now?

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,410
- As it has come to this, let's quickly finish off now.
- Stop the "shofunow" kind Japanese!

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,410
Stop the "Shofuno" kind Japanese!

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,350
That's just great! Since it's come to this, 
let's do the merger fast.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,820
Haven't you heard anything on CEO No?

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,280
I haven't.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,420
I'll have to use this status disclosure request
this morning, and find out what is up.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,360
That's it. Let's do a cheer. Come on.

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,660
With me. 
1, 2, 3... Yeah!

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,740
There is plenty of work, but 
nothing suits me, I guess.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,310
Where are you going?

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,510
I need to look around for some work.

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,340
Whereabout...

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,010
It's just here and there... 
Don't I need to at least make a try?

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,480
We can't even handle living expenses.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,420
Yeah... It must be hard, I see.

18
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,620
It's hard, but I have no choice.

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,130
It's almost time for the bus. 
I just can't miss that bus.

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,430
Is that so? Why didn't you say that earlier?

21
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:21,570
- Oh, it's no problem... 
- I kept jabbering on. Hurry up and go... Let's go.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,970
Making fools of people...

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,250
- Sister-in-law.
- Yes.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,520
Fighting, it is!

25
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,430
It's because they hear all these 
odd rumors about CEO No.

26
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,260
I know it's all nonsense but...

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,050
him to have become a vegetable...

28
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,700
to have died...

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,710
to have gone coocoo...

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,010
and to have supposedly had a...
sex change surgery...

31
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,940
What are you doing, hearing all 
this babbling nonsense?

32
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,040
That's just what I would say too!

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,980
All these rumor monger fellows should be
pronto arrested and...

34
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,280
we should flat-out slap them
with libel lawsuits, really!

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,420
This won't work... I should immediately go to
the legal counsels, and sue the pants off them!

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,990
Hey, hey, hey, hey... It's fine. It's fine.

37
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,860
Anyway, about CEO No, really...
There's no particular problem, right?

38
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,740
Only if I know precisely about the CEO's condition
can I decide on something... or do nothing on it...

39
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,570
Didn't I tell you already?

40
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,240
that he's currently convalescing after the surgery.

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,720
Then, how about him being seen once
publicly in the company itself?

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,570
At the company?

43
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,050
I mean, well, if that disclosure is also seen,
that will help the staff spirit too.

44
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,880
Even all these odd rumors...

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,660
One look at CEO's bright face, and 
just like that they'll all be rejected.

46
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,060
If it is all right to do, there is 
no reason not to do it, right?

47
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,900
Understood.

48
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,730
I will try to discuss it with Min Hyeok.

49
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,300
Say what? Suddenly you will quit working?

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,030
Why?

51
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,810
I mean, you're perfectly fine cleaning the
anchovy guts, but what's this suddenly?

53
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,370
Is it this anchovy guts 
the reason for quitting?

54
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,940
No. That is not it.

55
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,350
As I was thinking about quitting work,
I just happened to be cleaning anchovy guts.

56
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,820
You mean that is not it?

57
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,920
What is the reason?

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,960
My divorced husband keeps asking to 
remarry and it bothers me.

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,520
In this world with 2 moons in the sky,
who knows when I'll die...

60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,190
Cleaning anchovy guts in other people's house.
Is that all I would do, I wondered.

61
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,760
So I was right! About you quitting
because of anchovy guts.

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,070
If that is how you take it, I can't help it.

63
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,370
Anchovy guts is only the symptom
but not the cause.

64
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,410
No Min Hyeok... Clearly something is up with him.

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,610
If only I know his location, I will just...

66
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,450
What is it again with that 
scary, rolled-up-eye look?

67
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,650
What about his location?
Again into 'eliminating'?

68
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,850
We have no time left, now!

69
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,420
Director. Isn't there this poison blow-needle... 
that's blown like this?

70
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,620
Using that, anyone can be handled in a blink.

71
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,720
Ah, enough!

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,660
What kind of woman are you, being so
murderous the moment you talk?

73
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,490
You, really!

74
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,960
I was badly worried yesterday.

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,160
So I put all the possible situations in order.

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,370
Only No Min Hyeok's body is abnormal.

77
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,470
He is only mentally abnormal.

78
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,570
Everything is abnormal.

79
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,670
He's unaware of the USB's existence.

80
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,140
He's unaware only of the USB's contents.

81
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,870
He knows of both its existence and contents.

82
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,340
Ah, stop at that. Stop it!

83
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,640
You writing a thesis? What's the conclusion?
Say the damn conclusion.

84
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,850
As conclusion, there are 24 possibilities.

85
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,680
As only 3 scenarios among those are safe for us,

86
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,880
for the time being, we can monitor what happens.

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
Ah, enough!

88
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,390
There isn't even a bullshit conclusion.
After going on for so long...

89
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,320
Min Hyeok might somehow have to
make a trip to the company, it seems.

90
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,530
In that state, how can Min Hyeok go anywhere?

91
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,100
Still it's been so long since the accident.

92
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,300
As he has not shown up and
there are strange rumors,

93
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,230
even a disclosure request has come in.

94
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,800
We should just ask Dr. Min about

95
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,110
how long he has to stay and play 
in the hospital without returning.

96
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,580
Let's eat, I'm hungry.

97
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,780
Call for a delivery. No ajumma anymore.

98
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,610
Why?

99
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,650
That ajumma, damn... Shouldn't she work
at least till somebody else is found?

100
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,320
How heartless must you have been, for her to 
leave like that without even looking back?

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
I was wondering why you hadn't said it yet!

102
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,360
For you, whatever the issue is,
it's all my doing, right?

103
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,190
Was there nothing to what I said?

104
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,030
It's because you are so mean to others--

105
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,500
Hey, hey, father, just eat this... aigoo...

106
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,400
- Oh, so hot!
- Aigoo... Was it so hot?

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,630
Is it so hot? You eat one and see!

108
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,410
If it's scalding, just spit it out.

109
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,240
Spit it out, dad! Why do that?

110
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,480
So hot!

111
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:27,850
Oh, so hot.

112
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,320
Now do you see?

113
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,520
The tongue is all scalded.

114
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,350
Scalded, right?

115
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,760
Can't say... but it does look a bit red.

116
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,330
Then, till we find an Ajumma, 
we'll only be having takeaways?

117
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,630
Yeaaa... Dat's Yight! Dat will do!

118
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,000
What?

119
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,770
This morning, I saw the garage 
sister-in-law looking for work.

120
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,700
Anyway, it is quite like we are
already living together.

121
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,270
Having her handle the work in our home
will work out, right?

122
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,910
Then she's happy to find work, and
we're happy to find our person.

123
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,940
Both would be happy, right?

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,960
Are you crazy? No way.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
Why?

126
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
How can we ask people 
we know to do the work?

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,550
Also, it's housekeeping...
Anybody can do it, you think?

128
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,490
To do housework for a large house like ours
is a normal task, you think?

129
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,320
Is that so?

130
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,790
I feel it will be all right.

131
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,730
That's right. Somebody we know
helping out, is only nice, isn't it?

132
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,830
Isn't that right?

133
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,300
What do you all think?

134
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,870
I've no problem with anything.
As long as there is hot food.

135
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,430
But, is she good at cooking?

136
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,640
She is good. Quite tasty.

137
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,210
See? They all say they like it!

138
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,980
As I see it, without a job, they don't 
even have sustenance money.

139
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,380
So just take it as doing a good deed,
and let's try having her take over.

140
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,690
<i>Housemaid?</i>

141
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,520
Yes.

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,190
Sister-in-law, you also stop taking
all the trouble to find other jobs.

143
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,860
Working at our home
will be convenient too.

144
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,800
That's of course true, but the wages...

145
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,630
What I know is that it's 2 million Wons a month.
(~US$ 1800)

146
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,570
2 million...

147
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,610
As the work specifications are good, 
I can find somebody right away anytime.

148
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,810
But it's you that I recommended for it.

149
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,640
I want to help you however I can.

150
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:10,250
Oh, what to do? I know I'm quite clean and
efficient at managing my house.

151
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,450
But I have never done 
this type of work before.

152
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,020
Then just do as you normally do.

153
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,590
Then I will go, taking it that
you have agreed to do it.

154
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,890
So enjoy your meals.

155
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,560
Are you really going to do it?

156
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,500
Then I must do it. Isn't it 2 million Wons?
(~US$ 1800)

157
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,970
I don't feel too good about it.

158
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,800
Can we afford to be picky about this and that?

159
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,010
We'll be struggling badly in no time.

160
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,710
<i>I have organized here the things you need to do,
so please refer to it.</i>

161
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,920
As the situation has come to this,
I have to ask for your help.

162
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,850
Don't worry. Though I look like this, in my life
I have been quite efficient in house duties--

163
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,420
I think you'll have to start right away.
First do a vacuum cleaning.

164
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,460
Once it's done, grab the bedsheets for a wash,
and clean out the fridge once too.

165
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,660
You can finish before noon, right?

166
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,860
Ah, well, yes...

167
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,700
If you are ready, we should leave.

168
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,200
Sister-in-law.

169
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,140
Yes.

170
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,540
Why did you say 'fighting'? If anyone sees,
it's like something special is going on.

171
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,850
Ah, come on, you... 
It's no big deal.

172
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,680
You are happy now?

173
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,620
The homeless ones get a place to sleep.
The jobless with no money gets a job.

174
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,190
To them, you must be like Jesus.

175
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,120
I won't go as far as Jesus...

176
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,060
But then again...

177
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,730
<i>Then, you are saying it's okay to get discharged?</i>

178
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,030
As I had explained, there's nothing
abnormal with the brain.

179
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,600
The problem lies with the missing memories.

180
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,270
Going back to those daily life conditions,
and getting timely treatment here,

181
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,110
would in fact be better than being here, right?

182
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,880
I see. Then, his memories...
When do you think they will return?

183
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,180
As the memory is like a thread ball,
if we just find where it starts,

184
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,120
there can be a quick recovery, as in many cases.

185
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,060
That means, when he's at home,
just as per our instructions,

186
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,990
please keep repeating the 
brain stimulation exercises.

187
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:05,500
If you talk a lot with him, it can only help
us find the thread head, right?

188
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,070
<i>No Min Hyeok is in which hospital, you said?</i>

189
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,740
Sujieub Jeongmo hospital, 902?
I got it.

190
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,940
How is CEO No's condition?

191
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,880
It's a VIP patient room, so it's
impossible to get close to?

192
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,980
Fine, I see.

193
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,810
Good job!

194
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,650
So we know the hospital?

195
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,120
Then right away eliminate him.

196
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,950
That's it... Again it's elimination?

197
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,050
Quit it. That talk.

198
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,620
I mean, isn't it a bit urgent for us?

199
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,720
We do know that...

200
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,820
Piss off, man...

201
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,930
I said stop it!

202
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,860
Quickly check if there are people
we know at the Jeongmo hospital.

203
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,570
<i>The USB can be in the washing machine
or its vicinity, from laundry time, right?</i>

204
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,670
What are you doing?

205
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,510
Nothing.

206
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,240
Give it to me.

207
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,070
No need. No need.

208
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,640
Let me know anytime if you need my help.

209
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
Sure, thank you.

210
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,880
Miraculous, however one looks at it.

211
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,290
How can one's fate change like that
just as easily as turning one's palm?

212
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,220
My fate remains the same,
all 4 seasons, all year round.

213
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,430
Then come home soon tonight as well.

214
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,630
Wee need to discuss some Min Hyeok matters.

215
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,060
Fine then.

216
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,500
Sister-in-law, how is it? 
Quite a lot of things to do?

217
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,170
Well, as the house is quite big,
the chores are not trivial.

218
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,370
Take some rest too.

219
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,490
Cleaning rag! Cleaning rag! 
Quick, quick, quick!

220
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,050
Hurry, bring the damn rag, ajumma!

221
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,620
We must quickly wipe!
Hurry up. Hurry!

222
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,560
- Yes, sure...
- Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

223
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,400
- Detergent! Detergent!
- What?

224
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,960
Kitchen detergent... Detergent!

225
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm going insane! Ah, really... 
Make it fast. Make it fast.

226
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,040
What are you doing? Bring it quickly. Quick!

227
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,250
Is it stained?

228
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,820
Will it be fine?

229
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,660
What do you think? Does it look worn out?

230
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,590
It doesn't really look worn out.

231
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,060
Is that so?

232
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,360
Sorry, Sister-in-law.
Carry on with your work then.

233
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,040
Lost 10 years of my life!

234
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,870
Sister-in-law.

235
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,170
Take some rest as you work.

236
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,380
Ajumma?
(ajumma - older lady, maid)

237
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,210
Yes, he called me ajumma!

238
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,050
Must be a slip of the tongue.

239
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,250
Must be a habit from calling
the earlier maid 'ajumma'.

240
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,720
What slip of the tongue?

241
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,180
People's true colors come out under stress.

242
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,020
That's the only way I will take it.

243
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,060
Only impolite speaking came out. And then I had
fallen down, but still he was throwing temper.

244
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,890
Forget it. Stop talking, it's enough.

245
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,360
It was just a sofa that was getting a stain.

246
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,560
Had others seen it, they'd think
the house was on fire!

247
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,760
A little stain, and he says he lost 10 years of life.

248
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,330
A real miser. In my whole life I haven't seen
such a miser, really!

249
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,640
I've reached. I need to get down. Hanging up.

250
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,910
Hongberg! 
What's up?

251
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,020
May be you were waiting for me?

252
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,120
No.

253
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,580
No? Then what are you doing here?

254
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,690
Watching buses.

255
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,360
Hey, now that you are a rich kid, 
shouldn't you get rid of this "no no" syndrome?

256
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,560
Give it.

257
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,130
Oh ho? May be then you wanted to carry my bag?

258
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,060
No. Suddenly I wanted to 
carry a bag like this once.

259
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,370
Is that so? Can't do anything if your
"no no" syndrome is incurable.

260
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,470
Anyway, thank you.

261
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,300
<i>Won't they think that it's strange?</i>

262
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,510
When nobody can tell anything as they see him,

263
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,710
if Min Hyeok doesn't get back to work,
won't they think it's strange?

264
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,810
When they see no problems.

265
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,850
That's nothing... We can just say that
he's still recuperating and all that.

266
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,050
For that, isn't he is looking a bit too perfectly fine?

267
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,620
Then say it's only looking so, but he isn't fine.

268
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,450
Just saying he isn't fine won't do, you know.

269
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,190
Though he looks quite fine,

270
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,390
there's something that stops him from working.

271
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,590
One look, and it should be clear. 
That's how we should make it.

272
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,430
Then just put on a cast, won't that do?

273
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,260
Oh... That will work, I think!

274
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,830
Wow, sister-in-law, you have good sense!

275
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,670
Brother-in-law, some reward money please.

276
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,500
A cast isn't bad. It's clear from just looking.

277
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,070
Correct. If he must go, let's do it that way.

278
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,170
That way, we can buy some time.

279
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,010
Where should the cast be?

280
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,840
Neck? Arm? Leg?

281
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,040
Isn't arm better? I feel it is more comfortable.

282
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,510
Do it on the neck, I guess.

283
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,350
Ot the neck, won't it look a bit too serious?

284
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,820
That's why it's better on an arm.

285
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,280
The arm would look not serious-enough.

286
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,120
A wheelchair would be good, no? 
He'll look rich.

287
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,690
Let's ask Min Hyeok once too.

288
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,160
Why ask him about such a thing?

289
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,360
The affected person has opinions too!

290
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,130
Min Hyeok, if it's neck, arm or leg for a cast...

291
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,230
where would you want it to be?

292
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,070
What is a cast?

293
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,100
Can't I wear it all over?

294
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,670
Only one?

295
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,240
Then, leg?

296
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,440
Not sleeping?

297
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,280
I need to just wrap this up.

298
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:50,320
They never pay money and yet
use people to death or what?

299
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,350
My arms, legs, all the limbs....

300
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,820
You were working hard!

301
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,330
What kind of house is it, like a playground?

302
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,630
If people slip and fall, one needs a 
cart to take them out.

303
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,930
Especially the living room.
You can play even football there!

304
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,770
Exaggeration!

305
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,170
Then, putting a leg cast is what it is.

306
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,480
Hey, don't play football at night.

307
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,390
Seeing you totally tired, mom, 
you'll snore loudly tonight.

308
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,690
What do you mean? I don't snore or anything.

309
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,840
-=The CEO=-

310
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,190
Ms. Na Jin A. 
I return home tomorrow.

311
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,290
Really?

312
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,390
Wow, that's so nice.

313
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,430
I will go to the company too. When I come there,
Na Jin A, I can see you too.

314
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,170
Yes.

315
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,370
Right. Also, I'll be on crutches.

316
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,570
Why crutches? Are you hurt?

317
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,400
Yes. Badly.

318
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,610
Really? How did you get hurt?

319
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,440
I'm joking. It will be fake.

320
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,910
Huh? Why?

321
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,480
I don't know. It seems I must do it.

322
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,420
So late at night, but not asleep?

323
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,090
Yes. As I think of going home tomorrow, 
sleep just won't come.

324
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,290
I keep watching Superboard.

325
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,860
Ms. Jin A, do you also like NarARa Superboard?

326
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,060
No. I have never seen it.

327
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,530
Oh... I do know the song.

328
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,460
Chiki chiki chaka chaka chuku chuku cho.
Isn't that right?

329
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,570
The tooth-brushing dance.

330
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,030
That's correct.

331
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:55,110
Chiki chiki chaka chaka chuku chuku cho
If you ever do bad things...

332
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,210
Do what, you said?

333
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,040
Hurts-bad things?

334
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,610
Doing just "bad" things.

335
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,450
Bad things?

336
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,120
Chiki chiki chaka chaka chuku chuku cho.
Chiki chiki chaka chaka chuku chuku cho.

337
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,520
You will get exposed by us.

338
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,560
Na Jin A, you know no more than chiki chaka?

339
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,860
Yes. When you come to the company,
sing it again for me, for me to learn.

340
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,800
I will then do chiki chiki chaka chaka for you.

341
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,270
Okay.

342
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,570
When we say "exposed by us", what are we?

343
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,140
Oh... That is... What it is...

344
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,340
If you ask who we are...

345
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,010
For that I will have to tell you the
whole story from the beginning.

346
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,150
At the start, the Tripitaka buddhist monks found 
the Son O Gong monkey king stuck under a rock.

347
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,920
Initially the evil spirits who defeated Son O Gong
were sealed inside Princess I Sa's bracelet.

348
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,490
Why, ask ask? Because Princess I Sa is
the Jade Emperor's daughter.

349
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,330
To not get sucked into a space-time tunnel...

350
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,470
When Tripitaka monk was kidnapped, Pigsy and
Monk Sha went to Flame Mountain to save him.

351
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:57,140
With a cracking sound, the 7 hoodlums
of the universe appeared!

352
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,110
<i>Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.</i>

353
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,520
Did you call me?

354
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,080
Good, you're here.

355
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,190
Yes, what is...?

356
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:16,960
Nothing much else... but as I was eating peanuts,
one fell under the bed.

357
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,890
I want to get it out, but my arm isn't reaching it.

358
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,730
Just 1 more centimeter would've been enough.

359
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,030
Just leave it, please. 
Later when I clean, I can take it out.

360
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,970
If it's not done now itself, it'll keep bugging me.

361
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,270
I would be nice to get it out before you go out.

362
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,210
Then, shall I look for a long rod or something?

363
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,180
No, as the peanut is round and rolls... All we need
to do is to... blow on it with your mouth, it seems.

364
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,280
Huh?

365
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,220
My lung capacity is too poor, which is why.

366
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,890
As long as you blow "phoo" from there,
I think it will roll 1 centimeter this way.

367
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,830
Then I shall... take it out.

368
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,430
It's moving, it's moving, it's moving!

369
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,730
Just a bit more. Just once more. 
Blow with some force.

370
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,700
Snatched it!

371
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,190
Ok!

372
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,220
You did great there!

373
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,320
Are you all right?

374
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,920
I exerted too much to blow air. Got a bit dizzy.

375
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,960
Please throw it away for me, sister-in-law.

376
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,900
<i>This fellow. Damn I'll just...</i>

377
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,360
Why do you look at me like that?

378
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,300
It's nothing.

379
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,400
You aren't ready to go to the hospital?

380
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,870
I have to get ready.

381
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,540
Early morning, why are you staring at 
each other with such loving-like look?

382
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,840
What loving-like look?

383
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,780
She looked at me like this. So I also...

384
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,610
Why would she look like that?

385
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,020
But then, to those folks you are a Jesus. 
Of course she will look up to you.

386
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,490
Look at you, really...

387
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,260
Receiving respect from somebody
is not anything bad, right?

388
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,830
Keep your senses to behave right and
not let it go to a romance or anything.

389
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,500
In her eyes, you have charisma, good looks,
money and a good voice too.

390
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,070
As a target of crush for her, a perfect fit, it is!

391
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,640
What?

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,770
If this continues, really...
she might fall for me, no?

393
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,980
The poor woman...

394
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,810
I'll go down first and be waiting.

395
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,280
Fine.

396
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,050
Even if it's uncomfortable, hold on 
for a few hours. Understand?

397
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,350
Aigoo, such a perfectly fine fellow
being like a half-wit--

398
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,460
Father-in-law!

399
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,560
What?

400
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,760
It's because I'm sad that I say it...

401
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,330
Hold the crutches and try to walk.

402
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,100
The foot is wrong. You hurt your right foot. 
How can the right foot be walking?

403
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,940
Use the other foot to walk.

404
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,770
But I never hurt my right foot.

405
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,440
What I mean is, aren't we playing the game of 
pretend-injury? Try it once more.

406
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,210
Give it to me. Give it to me.

407
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,520
Look closely at this grandpa.

408
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,820
Like this. Like this. Like this.

409
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,020
- Left leg.
- What's so hard?

410
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,860
Oh, I get it.

411
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,060
Left leg. Use the left leg.

412
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,990
Left leg. Left leg. Left leg.

413
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,660
At the company, say just 3 things when you
see others, we asked. You remember it?

414
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,500
Long time no see. 
I'm glad to see you.

415
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,600
Soon I'll be coming back.

416
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,170
There you go. Say just these 3 sentences, okay?

417
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,370
I got it. But why say only these 3 things?

418
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,570
Because the company folks think
you turned into an idiot--

419
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,310
Father-in-law!

420
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,410
What?

421
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,980
It's because I am sad that I say it...

422
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,810
Fine, then. Let's go.

423
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,280
Correct. Left leg.

424
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,380
What?

425
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,320
No Min Hyeok is heading to the 
company now, you mean?

426
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,930
Aigoo, CEO sir, really, long time no see.

427
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,130
Long time no see. 
I'm glad to see you.

428
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,700
Aigoo! How worried we were!

429
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,740
Seeing you so safe and sound... It's a real relief.

430
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,940
Soon, I'll be coming back.

431
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,300
Pardon?

432
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,870
Let's go in quickly. We don't have much time.

433
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

434
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,850
Long time no see. I'm glad to see you.
Soon I will be coming back.

435
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,990
Long time no see. I'm glad to see you.
Soon I will be coming back.

436
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,160
- Dad. Ms. Na Jin A...
- Left leg. Left leg.

437
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,930
Left leg should be on the ground. 
Left leg. Left leg.

438
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:29,110
Ms. Na Jin A. Take that CF file
to the design office for me.

439
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,840
Yes.

440
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,780
Where did the plan on the character roles go?

441
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,510
Hmm? What for?

442
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,080
The CEO is back. We should
quickly get his signature.

443
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,550
The CEO is here?

444
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,020
<i>Yes.</i>

445
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,900
The stacked up files are all now signed.

446
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,740
That's all for today.

447
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,470
Crutches.

448
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,410
Having come after a long time, there's lots to
report to you. May be a brief meeting might...

449
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,510
Do it the next time. Next time.

450
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,550
That's right.

451
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,840
Looks like he hasn't seen the USB.

452
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,280
You think so too?

453
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,720
If he saw it, he can't be just 
leaving like this, right?

454
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,420
Quick, let's get inside.

455
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,700
It's Ms. Na Jin A.

456
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,890
CEO sir, are you leaving so soon?

457
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,710
Please say something before you go.

458
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,540
Yes, please give us a speech.

459
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,210
Well... Today he's a bit busy. 
He'll do it formally next time.

460
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,150
If you ever do bad things...

461
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,550
You will be exposed by us.

462
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,460
So, then...

463
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,270
<i>This does it. This does. Don't I tell you
only 3 cases were safe?</i>

464
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,210
Finished. All finished. 
We are finished, I tell you!

465
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,140
This is simply declaring a war.

466
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,710
You sure that it was directed at us?

467
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,020
Looking right at you, director, with a smile...

468
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,480
"You will be exposed by us".

469
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,690
He did it and my hairs stood up!

470
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,890
Saw the smile and they stood up more!

471
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,960
Let me just understand the situation.

472
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,630
For now, you just stay put.

473
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,770
There's no way this will do.

474
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,340
If we rely on just the Director, 
we are in deep shit.

475
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,810
What do you want to do?

476
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,210
I know how to handle this. 
You just help me.

477
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,590
Is somebody living here?

478
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,430
Oh, a company staff called Na Jin A.

479
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,260
Ms. Na Jin A?

480
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,830
Didn't she run an errand to you at the hospital?

481
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,870
Why is Na Jin A living here?

482
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,970
They have a situation.

483
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,540
Let's go in fast. They are all waiting for you.

484
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,740
Come on, let's eat.

485
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,410
I can't believe such a day would come.

486
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,820
A day when Min Hyeok and Jun Hyeok are 
in this home for us to have a meal together.

487
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,960
Come on grandfather. Why are you crying
on such a good day?

488
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,520
She's right. Now we'll be together many times.

489
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,460
But, why is Na Jin A living over there, 
in the garage?

490
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,660
Didn't I tell you... that they have a situation.

491
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,870
What does a 'situation' mean?

492
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,070
Why do you keep wanting to know this?

493
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,540
She's into cars, you know. Cars.

494
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,210
So, it's to sleep with cars that she lives there.

495
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,240
<i>This fellow has now turned us into freaks.</i>

496
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,180
Oh, that's why she lives there?

497
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,010
Yeah, I knew that would be it.

498
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,120
Na Jin A by herself?

499
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,950
No, she lives with her mother.

500
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,790
Mom? Na Jin A has a mom too?

501
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,620
Yes. She has one. It's me.

502
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,920
I am Na Jin A's mom.

503
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,230
You, ajumma?

504
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,530
But Na Jin A is so cute looking...

505
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,470
<i>Hell, what's this now?</i>

506
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,290
I have to tell you this squarely.

507
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,960
I'm helping you, but it absolutely doesn't mean
that I second your views, okay?

508
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,260
Just so you're sure, I'm making it clear to you.

509
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,460
Get the rope properly fixed.

510
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,030
Hardly a thought, in shooting poison?

511
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,230
Where in the world did you learn this from?

512
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,700
Heck, there's tuition class on this too?

513
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,270
During college days, I stayed a while
in South Africa.

514
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,110
Then I learned it just in case I needed it.

515
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,310
Why had you gone to South Africa?

516
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,510
Charity work.

517
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,180
You went all the way for charity work
and learned to shoot poison needles?

518
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,590
Why you are so bull-headed,
I really have no idea!

519
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,720
1102.

520
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,330
1002.

521
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,270
902.

522
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,470
This is it.

523
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,340
Where did he go?

524
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,380
Went to the bathroom?

525
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,580
Oh, so cold.

526
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,660
Has everyone left?

527
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,390
I guess...

528
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,860
How come the car can't exit?

529
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,060
Isn't the garage entrance narrow?

530
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,100
Min Hyeok and Jun Hyeok have already slept?

531
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,400
Min Hyeok oppa wanted to sleep together.
He took Jun Hyeok up to his room.

532
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,970
Really? Rascals...

533
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,440
What cookies are these?

534
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,270
Oliooli.

535
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,740
Quite tasty.

536
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,750
Is there anything that you need?

537
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,960
No. Finished your work?

538
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,690
Yes.

539
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,790
Then, let me get going now.

540
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,360
Then, take some of this with you.

541
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,830
What is this?

542
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,930
It's American cookies.

543
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,500
Go and please eat it, sharing with Jin A.

544
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,330
American cookies?

545
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,000
I thought Jin A may have never seen
anything like American cookies.

546
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,570
Take it back and eat together.

547
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,780
<i>Damn, I want to just...</i>

548
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,450
<i>But then, to those folks you are a Jesus.</i>

549
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,020
<i>In her eyes, you have charisma, good looks,
money and a good voice too.</i>

550
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,690
<i>As a target of crush for her, a perfect fit, it is!</i>

551
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,860
Shall we see one more episode?

552
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,160
No, we'll watch just that much today.

553
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,810
Has Na Jin A returned?

554
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,150
Why is Na Jin A sleeping in the garage? 
Really because she likes cars?

555
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,820
Who knows?

556
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,060
Right. Where had you gone?

557
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,100
Grandpa had said it. That you went somewhere 
for a long time and came back.

558
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,560
Where had you gone?

559
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,070
It was just... here and there.

560
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,270
Will you leave again?

561
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,210
You won't, right?

562
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,780
Mmm.

563
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,260
It's cold.

564
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,760
What are you doing? Not there?

565
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,670
Why is he not coming back? 
It's-s-s-s-s... cold.

566
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,320
Give them some more?

567
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,160
Truly three-faced! 
Dead face, hateful face, irritating face.

568
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,630
Stop it, please!

569
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,830
That face is like a flat-screen TV,
too flat and wide.

570
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,040
The things he does. Oh, what a scrooge!

571
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,240
Saying it's American cookies, he gives 4 pieces!

572
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,710
We are what, beggars?

573
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,540
It's not like it's the 80's.

574
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,380
American cookies... how ridiculous is that?

575
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,410
Supermarts are full of American cookies.
He knows nothing of the world, nor sensitivity.

576
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,720
This morning when I was blowing the peanut
I nearly gave him a slap.

577
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,020
Mrs. Gil Seon Ja. You better stop it. Understand?

578
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,420
Really, it's just the 2 million Wons wages.
Just for that money, I have to take this!

579
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,870
- Who is it? 
- Who is it there?

580
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,450
<i>Truly three-faced! 
Dead face, hateful face, irritating face.</i>

581
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,550
<i>What is this?</i>

582
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,580
<i>Why me? What wrong have I done?</i>

583
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,990
<i>To those folks... you are what, a Jesus, right?</i>

584
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,290
<i>Right. Though I'm not sure 
I'll take it as far as Jesus...</i>

585
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:42,600
<i>I was always very kind and
gentle towards them.</i>

586
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,170
<i>These looks and this smile.</i>

587
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:51,770
<i>No matter how hard I think, me being taken
this way... is hard to believe for me.</i>

588
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,070
<i>Where did it start going wrong?</i>

589
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,540
<i>American cookies?</i>

590
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,380
<i>Peanut?</i>

591
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,310
<i>Where did I start going wrong?</i>

592
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,590
Great job guys, great job! You won't listen to me
and are off doing what you want, really?

593
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,790
If he was discharged, why didn't you 
tell us quickly?

594
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,630
I also came to know only now.

595
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,930
Anyway what is with this outfit?
How can you go to the bathroom?

596
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,770
Unable to go, to the bathroom.

597
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,070
And this outfit is too conspicuous. 
Was this meant to camouflage?

598
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,370
The color, look at this color. 
How can the gloss be so extreme?

599
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,580
Gloss is the essence of this costume!

600
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,040
They don't come out in dull texture.

601
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,250
hey, where did you get this costume from?
Stationery store?

602
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,450
A complete set with the poison needles?

603
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,240
-=Next Episode Preview=-

604
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,020
How about going to another hospital
to re-do a DNA test?

605
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,260
Must it be done? 
Jun Hyeok will be hurt if he knows.

606
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,730
What are you doing? Card games? 
We have our version that's more fun.

607
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,680
Shall I teach you guys?

608
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,210
For now, I'll cut his nails in a casual way.

609
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,260
i will ruffle your hair one more time.

610
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,380
- You got it?
- Of course! I nearly died for this.

611
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,320
How can you teach the children
to play Hwatu?

612
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,550
Why do you think Hwatu is bad, with no doubts?

613
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,000
What are you doing? Really!

614
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,280
I can't do it anymore.
I feel guilty, drop me from this.

615
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,700
This time, break the light.

616
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,470
Put all you have at stake 
and wage your fight.

617
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,050
Even if it's not the real Jun Hyeok, wanting to
just accept him is how I feel now.

618
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,550
I hate spoiling it.

619
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,900
