1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,577
I'll go to see Min Hyeok. I had told Bo Yeong that
I'll take over at 3 o'clock and I am late.

2
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:19,979
Why do you look like that?

3
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:22,915
Lately, the pee is a bit...

4
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:24,984
It seems I'll have to get it checked out.

5
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:28,521
Again it's a pee problem?
Why are you always so edgy?

6
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:31,590
No. I have a bit of a bad feeling on this.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,660
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

8
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,262
What is it?

9
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:38,731
No, but lately the pee is always--

10
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:41,800
Ah, stop that. 
I thought it was about Min Hyeok.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,339
Every day it's urine, urine, urine. All my life,
I have never seen anybody who pees so much.

12
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:51,010
<i>Pull a bit harder from inside.
Pull again a bit.</i>

13
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:58,284
Don't just hold with the hands.
Push it up.

14
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:01,754
How can I push anymore?

15
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:05,958
How can you have it in here?
This is a bus. Not a moving van. Damn.

16
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,093
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:09,962
Ajumma, what are you doing now?
<i> </i>
(Ajumma - old lady, aunt)

18
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:12,898
- Hurry. We will be late for work.
- Still not done?

19
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:14,300
Mom, hurry, hurry.

20
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,837
This won't work. You just go to work.

21
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:19,038
Mom, what are you going to do?

22
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,639
I will slowly roll it, what else?

23
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:22,975
That makes no sense.
How can you roll it all the way there?

24
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:26,312
Why can't I roll it?
Sir, just go ahead.

25
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:28,047
I'll call you.

26
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:33,919
So late. See how long it took.

27
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:36,388
Hey, you should've asked her to take a taxi.

28
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:05,084
What do you think?

29
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,092
Is there something unusual?

30
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:18,430
This should be virtually asymptomatic.
How did you even feel it?

31
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,168
As it is usually not sensitive,
it would be hard to guess.

32
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:26,772
What... what is it you are saying?

33
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,175
There's a tumor on the kidney.

34
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:31,377
Roughly 1.4 cm.

35
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:33,112
Don't you see it here?

36
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:36,849
Tumor?
Then, a cancer is...

37
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,450
Well, a kind of cancer, you see.

38
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,319
It's a kind of cancer, you see.

39
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,995
Though a cancer, it hasn't spread or anything.

40
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:53,866
Having found it this early,
it can be easily removed.

41
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,736
It's hardly anything. 
Since you're here, let's go eat something.

42
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:58,938
Anterior to it, there's just a--

43
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:02,341
Stop deliberately acting to 
make it easy on me, you!

44
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:04,944
Hey, what is this you're doing?

45
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:08,013
Tell me honestly.

46
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:11,016
How long do I have left?

47
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:16,088
How long left, of what? It can be removed with
just a laparoscope. What's your problem, really?

48
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:17,423
Cancer...

49
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,899
Keep it a secret from the family for me.

50
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:32,638
If the family folks know,
they will be in deep distress.

51
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:34,240
It will be a big favor.

52
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:36,041
You know, right?

53
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:47,786
<i>Why is he going so overboard like this?</i>

54
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:52,658
He was always going overboard, but his mother
had suddenly passed away with cancer though.

55
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:56,862
Because of that shock,
his cancer-phobia is quite big.

56
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:10,276
Chauffeur Gim,
Really, do my sad premonitions ever go wrong?

57
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:14,079
<i>Mom!</i>

58
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:17,149
Mom!

59
00:04:17,683 --> 00:04:20,753
Are you doing well?

60
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,290
I want to see you, mom.

61
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,028
Your son Su-eet Dong is sure to come to you.

62
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:35,901
Your cute little Su-eet Dong
will sure be following you.

63
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,978
Mom!

64
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:07,066
Mom, where are you?

65
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,869
=Oh... a sauna house.=

66
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:11,203
Got there easily?

67
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,006
They'll let the luggage be there?

68
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:16,942
That's good to hear.

69
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:19,211
Eat meals on time.

70
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:34,627
<i>You see those blue and red icons there?</i>

71
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,962
<i>The blue one is me, and the red one is you.</i>

72
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:42,368
Where did you go? Son of a bitch.

73
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:52,044
Have everyone heard of asteroid babies?

74
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:58,184
From couples' intimacy worldwide the night before
the asteroid came, many babies are to be born.

75
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:02,188
Because of this, the Obstetrics and Gynecology
departments are in for a bonanza.

76
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:03,189
What is she saying?

77
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:09,328
On the asteroid day, many babies got conceived.
They'll be called asteroid babies, she said.

78
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:15,334
How silly. When they heard of the world ending,
these people only wanted to sleep together?

79
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,069
You're back, dad?

80
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,811
Father!

81
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:29,748
Damn, it hurt like hell, you brat. You gone crazy? 
You don't see that I'm picking earwax?

82
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:31,217
My ear.

83
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,622
Dad, you crying?

84
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:38,224
No.

85
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:42,027
I won't cry.

86
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,233
My daughter...
Long time since I hugged you.

87
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:49,168
What's with you, dad?

88
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:51,570
You fellow, why are you always
catching people off-guard?

89
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,239
Father, I should ask why you are like this!

90
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,974
Su Yeong, you too.

91
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:58,844
This way, you'll all regret it.
Just give it some time.

92
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:01,847
When the time comes,
it will be too late.

93
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:04,984
Dad, where are you going again?

94
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:07,119
What is up with him?

95
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,855
Is he like pregnant or something? That fellow...

96
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,995
Mom, which sauna house did you say it was?

97
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:19,064
- It's an asteroid commemoration event. 
- What is the name of the sauna house?

98
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,332
I've come somewhere nearby.

99
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:23,135
What for? It's fine.
It's pretty good. You just go back.

100
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,272
What do you mean go back? 
Now I have to go to work only tomorrow.

101
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,011
What? Meet in front of the Singyo dong-office?
Why?
(Dong - an administrative area)

102
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,219
That's right. 
Meet me in front of the dong-office in 20 minutes.

103
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:42,221
- Mom!
- Omo! You scared me to death!

104
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:44,957
What is this you're doing,
sitting in the alley?

105
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,694
So your conclusion is to sleep on the street?

106
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:52,431
What else to do? Everybody sends me out
saying they can't take in this stuff to keep.

107
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:56,235
Plus, sleeping is the same anywhere.
Sauna houses cost money too.

108
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:58,103
Since when are you living so frugally?

109
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,772
That's why I ask 
why you bought the hot mats?

110
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,241
Again that talk?
My ears are going numb, seriously!

111
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,643
If you talk so much, why didn't you
take up that assistant manager job?

112
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:06,512
If you hadn't quit from there,
it would've been better than this.

113
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:08,180
Now, what right do you have
to talk back at me like--

114
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,918
Ah, keep that down, will you?
Kicking up ruckus in other people's crib...

115
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,188
Quickly get everything.

116
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:17,523
What? To go where?

117
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:20,925
Wherever it is.
In any case, how can we sleep here?

118
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:27,399
If I ever do bad things...

119
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:33,005
He is showing that there were
things he liked where his memories ended.

120
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:35,474
He is thoroughly happy,
and active also, right now.

121
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,276
That's right.

122
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:42,815
Later as well, we'll continue the psychological
treatment like this, till the memory recovers.

123
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:45,751
You're here?

124
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,219
Hello.

125
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:53,225
Min Hyeok!

126
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,894
Daddy, what is this?

127
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:57,496
What are you doing? 
The boy is concentrating on something.

128
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,231
- Then, I will see you again tomorrow.
- Sure, yes, yes.

129
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,635
They are giving him things he liked 
from where his memories ended.

130
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:07,973
They say his behavior is good. He's also become
active, and there's a big change in his optimism--

131
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,582
Are you crazy? 
The son's around, and you've gone mad?

132
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,851
What is this? 
All passionate now?

133
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:29,929
Isn't this your company?

134
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,864
Sleep at your company office?

135
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,666
It's you who said nobody
will take on this luggage.

136
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,467
For tonight, just stay here.

137
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:38,404
Then go through the front entrance.
Why enter by the back door?

138
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:40,339
You think Security will let us in?

139
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,943
If we go to the underground parking lot,
we can directly take the elevator up.

140
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:47,546
Don't just try pushing hard. 
Do it with a strategy.

141
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,415
How do we do it with a strategy?

142
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:51,884
Don't think of just pushing. 
Feel how it would roll.

143
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,752
Like this. Like this.

144
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:56,222
In 1 day, you became a 
rolling engineer ajumma!

145
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:03,229
From here it goes downhill, right?

146
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:05,231
For downhill, it's a counter-position.

147
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,927
Yeah, it's here.

148
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:55,214
It won't work this way. 
Let's do it in one shot.

149
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,949
Come back here.

150
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:02,421
1. 2. 3.

151
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,966
Hello.

152
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,968
Is this Bo Yeong?

153
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:18,170
My dearest daughter, Bo Yeong.

154
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,972
Oh, dad. Later, later.

155
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,842
Do you know how much I love you?

156
00:11:23,242 --> 00:11:25,110
I remember from when you were little.

157
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,713
When you went with me to Grandmother's place,

158
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:30,249
you said you wanted to catch lantern fish--

159
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:44,864
The room seems to be locked.

160
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,332
There is no other vacant room?

161
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:47,600
What, is this a hotel?

162
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,667
Who said it's a hotel?

163
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,004
I just asked if there's a vacant room,
and you start on something else...

164
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:59,011
Might as well go to our office itself.

165
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,950
Mom. It's weird, must you wear
night clothes in an office?

166
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,951
What about it?

167
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,960
What is weird about wearing
might clothes when you sleep?

168
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,962
Even if you sleep only an hour,
you should sleep right.

169
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,232
Not just that you're my mom,
but you're unique.

170
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:23,369
Oh...
What are you wearing tomorrow for work?

171
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,505
Not sure. May be the sky blue colored
piece I had bought some time back?

172
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:28,107
Oh? that one?

173
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:30,042
Wait a moment.

174
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:36,315
It''s fine, it's fine. 
How can you find it like that?

175
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:38,050
Here it is!

176
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,986
What's this? You are a
first class baggage handler too?

177
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:43,189
The wrinkled insides need pressing.

178
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,461
When do you start work tomorrow?

179
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:50,663
8 o'clock.

180
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:53,199
Then we'll have to get up at 5 o'clock,
to have enough time.

181
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,336
It's all done.

182
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,607
Mom, I see that people have
things they have aptitude in.

183
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:05,077
- What do you mean?
- Mom, how you look now... what shall I say...

184
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:08,080
looks so natural.
Like an otter that saw water.

185
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,951
I am tired. I will have to sleep.

186
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,352
Toothbrush...

187
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:29,301
<i>The surgery will surely fail.
My sad premonitions never miss the mark.</i>

188
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:37,109
<i>Is my life going to end in such emptiness?</i>

189
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,980
<i>My life... My memories...</i>

190
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:19,952
<i>They end... in a miserable way.</i>

191
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:27,960
Hey, horse head. Have you by chance
heard any news on Choe Yeong?

192
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,964
Went to the U.S. after a marriage?

193
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,234
Oh... Is that so?

194
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:39,171
Would you perhaps know her contact details?

195
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:43,042
You don't know?

196
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:49,648
Hey, Gim Seun. May be you remember this?

197
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:53,719
We had promised to go together to
Sahara desert once we were 60.

198
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,588
Shall we go together at least now?

199
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:56,989
What do you think?

200
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:04,730
Lying down here like this
is quite comfortable.

201
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,999
What comfort? Just go to sleep.

202
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,937
Before I forget, what happened to
your CEO who had got hurt?

203
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:14,940
I don't know. He still hasn't 
come to the company.

204
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:21,947
How did our next-door youngster
disappear without even a word?

205
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,219
I don't know. Son of a bitch.

206
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:44,370
<i>Seonbaenim! seonbaenim!</i>
<i> </i>
(Seonbaenim - senior colleague)

207
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:51,977
<i>I made this with the motivation from 
that iron shovel. Isn't it a fun thing?</i>

208
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:59,185
Sure, Na Soe Dol. 
You were a good man.

209
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,394
It's me.

210
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:14,200
About us sending rice to Na Soe Dol's family... 
Haven't we been sending it in recent years also?

211
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,802
I was anyway going to report to you on that.

212
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:19,271
This time the rice got returned.

213
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,274
Returned? Why?

214
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,367
Mom!

215
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:51,103
Mom! Mom! Mom! Wake up quickly!

216
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:52,972
What's wrong?

217
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,977
- What? 
- It's 8 o'clock. 8 o'clock!

218
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,254
Get out, first.

219
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,660
<i>Good morning.</i>

220
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,928
Oh Miss Jin A, you're already here?

221
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:17,263
Yes.

222
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:24,870
But, what is that?

223
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,805
That one is... 
Supplies. It's supplies.

224
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,140
Supplies?

225
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,942
What supplies?

226
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:33,212
It is for taking to the storage.
I will take it there now.

227
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,215
But Miss Jin A, you have no make-up on?

228
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:38,751
It's not like that.

229
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:42,354
I was making it a bit natural.
They say its popular lately.

230
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,359
Excuse me.

231
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,161
What's wrong?

232
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:53,032
Would you like to see me do
an Lee Jeong Hyeon number?

233
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:56,235
When I practiced a little while back,
it was coming out very well.

234
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,373
Why are you dancing right from morning?

235
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:27,333
How is it? Isn't this good enough
for me to enter Superstar K?
(TV talent competition)

236
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,069
Can't say. May be better not to take part?

237
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:32,338
Then I'll just take the supplies away!

238
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:40,946
Ms. Gil Seon Ja. Ms. Gil Seon Ja.

239
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,016
Ms. Gil Seon Ja.

240
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:48,020
Ms. Gil Seon Ja.

241
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:51,423
What was there now? May be a ghost?
Whatever it was that went in so fast.

242
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:53,893
May be so.
It was wearing some flowing white dress.

243
00:18:53,893 --> 00:18:56,162
My hairs are standing up.

244
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:57,830
Flowing dress?

245
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,899
If it's a flowing dress...

246
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:01,967
Ms. Gil Seon Ja!

247
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:04,970
Ms. Gil Seon Ja!

248
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,984
Supplies. It's supplies.

249
00:19:22,388 --> 00:19:24,323
Ms. Gil Seon Ja.

250
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:26,992
Ms. Gil Seon Ja.

251
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:33,933
Where did she go?

252
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,269
She didn't take her mobile phone either.

253
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:48,948
Where the heck did she go?

254
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:52,017
Is there anyone inside?

255
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,755
Isn't anybody there?

256
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,958
Shoot, what do I do?

257
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:11,904
I am not seeing the feet.

258
00:20:11,904 --> 00:20:13,572
Isn't it because there's nobody inside?

259
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:15,307
Isn't it locked from inside?

260
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:17,176
Obviously there's someone.

261
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:20,312
Oooooh, then what's it?
That fast-moving ghost is there, you mean?

262
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:22,314
Creeping us out in the morning itself...

263
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:25,985
It seems she was seen upstairs
moving in a flowing white dress.

264
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:28,254
Try to take a look from above.

265
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:32,258
No way. If you are so curious, you try looking.

266
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:35,060
This won't work. I'll go call the Security ajussi.

267
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:57,016
There's something I need to get done.

268
00:20:57,016 --> 00:21:01,554
Can an employee--
No. No need to ask an employee.

269
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:04,690
Send up anyone among the interns.

270
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,624
Which floor was it on?

271
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:06,959
7th floor.

272
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,230
It seems locked from inside,
but nobody's there. It's strange.

273
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:15,434
I heard someone upstairs felt that
they saw a ghost in a flowing dress.

274
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:17,903
It can't be that, can it?

275
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,311
Look, is anybody there?

276
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:27,913
Open the door.

277
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:33,319
So, you won't?
I am breaking it open and coming in.

278
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,797
What was that just now?

279
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:47,333
That is crazy fast!

280
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:52,471
Ms. Gil Seon Ja.

281
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:55,007
Answer me, Ms. Gil Seon Ja.

282
00:21:58,344 --> 00:21:59,945
Here, here!

283
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:04,950
Do you know how much playacting
I was doing since morning?

284
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,352
Why didn't you set the alarm? 
Didn't you say you would?

285
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:08,687
I had set it. Without knowing
I must have shut it off.

286
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:10,890
Shut it off, you said? 
I really go insane because of you!

287
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,960
- But where is our big bag?
- In the parking garage. Hurry, it needs to go out.

288
00:22:16,095 --> 00:22:17,363
The door seems locked.

289
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:18,697
Try to open the door.

290
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:19,965
Just a moment.

291
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:29,241
Climb up over there.

292
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,843
How do I climb up there?

293
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:33,245
There's no time. Hurry up.

294
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:46,992
What are you doing?

295
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,928
It's open.

296
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,133
How are you doing?

297
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:56,001
What are you doing here?

298
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:58,204
I thought there was a training session here.

299
00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:00,005
I'm sorry.

300
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:04,143
She scared me.

301
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:07,479
How come I just don't get a good impression
whenever I see her?

302
00:23:07,479 --> 00:23:09,949
Is it that she is only a high school grad?

303
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:16,822
I had secretly sent somebody to look for
the USB in that house, but she failed.

304
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:19,959
But that fox of a woman keeps on
asking me to give her money.

305
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,628
Saying she would let out our plan
if I don't give her money.

306
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,363
What would be best to do here?

307
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:28,968
See this, see this. Here it comes again.

308
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:33,706
- Hello
- Hurry up, give me the dough. Dough!

309
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:36,976
You don't give it, and it is all coming out!
Okay?

310
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:38,978
I understand.

311
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:42,982
I'm in a meeting now.
Let's talk later, okay?

312
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:47,653
What do I do with this?

313
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:48,787
Just kill her, what else?

314
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:51,991
For you, they are all there to be just killed?
This way, someday you will kill me too!

315
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:53,526
You too have to be killed, if needed.

316
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:56,595
What? See this. Hey, kill me, then.
Kill me, then. Kill me, then!

317
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:58,063
That's enough!

318
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:02,468
You guys meet, and it's only to fight.
Like it's all planned...

319
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,470
Your fight is all in the script. Isn't it so?

320
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,939
What script do you mean?

321
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,009
I'm suffocating.

322
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,212
What's that?

323
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:15,881
How about convincing her to take just half of it?

324
00:24:15,881 --> 00:24:18,484
You think she'll get convinced?
Just kill her.

325
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:19,618
What if she gets convinced?

326
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:20,953
What if she is not?

327
00:24:20,953 --> 00:24:22,821
- If she doesn't, we can find a solution then.
- If she doesn't, there will be nothing we can do.

328
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:24,623
- Wake up and smell the roses, my friend! 
- How the heck am I a friend to you?

329
00:24:24,623 --> 00:24:26,225
That's enough. Enough!

330
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:28,227
It's these guys I take along and...

331
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:34,033
But why does a poop smell keep coming?

332
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,035
Didn't someone fart here?

333
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:38,304
It can't be me. 
Not sure of him though.

334
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:40,172
It's not me, okay?

335
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,576
For a while I was feeling the
stench to be coming from above.

336
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:47,313
See this, he clearly lets one out,
but blames this place, how dare--

337
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:48,981
Quiet!

338
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:51,984
But just now some sound did come from above...

339
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:10,069
I'm busy like hell and he asks to
send up an intern or whatnot...

340
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:13,873
Oh, Miss Na Jin A. 
What are you doing here? Busy?

341
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,341
No, I'm not busy or anything.

342
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:18,944
Ah, then that's great. Go up to the
Adviser's office now. Hurry up.

343
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,954
Did you call me?

344
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:32,291
Could you go look for something
in this neighborhood?

345
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:34,960
There's somebody I need to find.

346
00:25:37,897 --> 00:25:39,098
At this place?

347
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:41,834
I heard that the people there have moved out.

348
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,903
Please ask around for me 
where they have gone.

349
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:45,304
See the name written there?

350
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:46,972
Someone called Na Geon A.

351
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:00,186
I'm about to die. Where is this place?

352
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:10,863
But may I ask you
why you're looking for these people?

353
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,866
They are the
family of a close junior I had long back.

354
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,935
I wondered how they're doing.

355
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:19,004
This Na Geon A is... 
that friend's son.

356
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:23,008
It is Na Jin A. 
A daughter.

357
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:28,080
Was it a daughter that Soe Dol had?

358
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,281
But...

359
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,284
It is me...

360
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:36,288
This place is... the house that we were living in.

361
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:40,359
I am the late Na Soe Dol's daughter.
Na Jin A.

362
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,094
Really?

363
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,562
You are?

364
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,030
Yes.

365
00:26:56,308 --> 00:26:58,110
Oh, I'll be darned!

366
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,579
You were so near me, you mean?

367
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:02,648
- You live with your mom now?
- Yes.

368
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:04,250
Mom is doing fine, right?

369
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,253
It would be so nice to see your Mom once--

370
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:11,123
What is this?

371
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:12,992
Oh, it is... Hello.

372
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,196
I mean... from there... how come?

373
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,199
Mom, hurry, get down. What are you doing?

374
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:27,940
That means, because you had nowhere to go
you stayed the night in the company office?

375
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,208
- Yes. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

376
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:32,344
How sad...

377
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:35,014
I should have properly taken care of you.

378
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:36,815
Seeing my sister-in-law and Geon A--

379
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:39,018
It's Jin A. Na Jin A.

380
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:42,488
Jin A... 
You are no different than family to me.

381
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:43,756
It's me who feels sorry.

382
00:27:43,756 --> 00:27:45,624
- Then where-- 
- No, it's nothing.

383
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,827
For sending rice every year, many thanks.

384
00:27:47,827 --> 00:27:50,296
What thanks?

385
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:51,764
But Geon A, how did you--

386
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:53,499
It's Jin A.

387
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:57,236
Jin A, how come you...
thought of working in our company?

388
00:27:57,236 --> 00:28:00,239
Working at Kong Kong was my dream.

389
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:10,049
Then temporarily, you sister-in-law and Geon A--
Jin A, Jin A...

390
00:28:10,783 --> 00:28:14,987
Jin A... You both are in a
desperate housing situation, right?

391
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:20,793
It seems, until you find some housing,
you need at least a temporary shelter...

392
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:23,863
No, no. We should be able to handle it...

393
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,733
At least temporarily you need to
have some place to stay.

394
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,802
It's nothing. We are all right.

395
00:28:29,802 --> 00:28:33,739
Adviser, with that money,
finding temporary stay is a bit...

396
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,742
Really? It's not more than 100 000 Wons.
(~US$ 88)

397
00:28:36,742 --> 00:28:38,210
They can't find a motel or something?

398
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,612
May be no more than 2 days.

399
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:40,880
Is that so?

400
00:28:41,814 --> 00:28:45,684
Prices have gone up?

401
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,220
Should I go look for some money?

402
00:28:49,622 --> 00:28:52,691
Then temporarily... why not stay at our house?

403
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:53,292
- Huh?
- Huh?

404
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:56,362
Because you have all the house stuff,
it's tough to go anywhere, you said.

405
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:58,297
Temporarily, just stay at our place then.

406
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:00,166
We have many vacant rooms in our house.

407
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,901
No, we shouldn't.

408
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:03,369
Can we really do that?

409
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:07,640
It's all right. Soe Dol's family is my family too.

410
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,776
It's only temporarily anyway. 
Just do it that way.

411
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:13,979
Thank you. Thank you.

412
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:18,317
Then just temporarily...
Thank you.

413
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:21,053
Honey, it's me.

414
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:22,388
What's wrong?

415
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:24,056
It's nothing much else...

416
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:27,660
Didn't you know Soe Dol? Na Soe Dol.

417
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:31,664
I just met Soe Dol's wife and daughter.

418
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:33,999
They both seem to be homeless now.

419
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:35,267
So what are you saying we do?

420
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,803
So I was thinking about it.

421
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:41,407
I felt it would be nice if they could stay 
in our house at least temporarily.

422
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:42,808
Don't we have guest rooms?

423
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:44,610
Our house has some guest rooms?

424
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,878
Well, on the 2nd floor...

425
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:47,079
What room on the 2nd floor?

426
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,081
Even the storage room has so much
clothes and is overflowing.

427
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:50,883
Seriously, you aren't talking of
Jun Hyeok's room now, are you?

428
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:53,953
I'm not. Just take some clothes
out from the storage room and--

429
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:59,158
Stop the nonsense. With Min Hyeok in this
state now, you're bringing outsiders here?
Have you lost your mind now?

430
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:04,096
Just this time, let's go by what I say.

431
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:08,367
I told you not to say pointless crap.
What kind of nonsense is this?

432
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:12,771
Whatever the hell I say, 
do you have to oppose it?

433
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,774
I really hadn't planned to tell you this but...

434
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,309
I have cancer!

435
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:19,778
You have cancer, so what?

436
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:20,779
What?

437
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,781
I also know it. 
I had a phone call with Dr. Yu.

438
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:26,385
As it is found so early, it can be fixed with a 
simple laparoscopic surgery, then what?

439
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:28,254
What does that have to do with
giving them a room here?

440
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:30,055
Room? No way!

441
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:32,258
Just listen to what I say, please.

442
00:30:32,258 --> 00:30:34,994
I am a cancer-stricken fellow!

443
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:38,330
Geez!

444
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:41,934
In any case, a room looks a bit iffy...

445
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:45,538
It's all right. Thank you so much for the concern.

446
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:49,008
What to do with this? 
A place to sleep...

447
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:54,146
Hey... No, no, no, no, no, no...

448
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,347
That won't make sense.

449
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:57,016
What won't?

450
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:59,818
I mean, at my house...

451
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:02,154
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.

452
00:31:02,154 --> 00:31:03,622
No way can it make sense...

453
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:06,492
Oh, it's all right. Want did you want to say?

454
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:09,028
Well... It's that...

455
00:31:10,296 --> 00:31:12,565
People are not vehicles. How can I do this?

456
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:15,434
I don't know what you're getting at,
but for us, wherever it is,

457
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:19,972
if we could at least leave the big bag,
it wouldn't matter where.

458
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:29,114
In a garage, your stay will be quite inconvenient.

459
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:31,984
It's just temporary. It is quite all right.

460
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:35,254
Temporarily, yes.

461
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:40,659
Ah, right! 
Though I can't do much else,

462
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:44,263
let me raise you from intern status
to a regular employee.

463
00:31:44,263 --> 00:31:45,798
Oh, no. It is all right.

464
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:47,199
I would rather have it based on my abilities.

465
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:50,870
That is it. Well, it's not even so hard.
This can be done with a phone call.

466
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,404
Oh, please don't. It's really fine.

467
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:56,942
May be so, but she does chant the song
"regular employee, regular employee"...

468
00:31:56,942 --> 00:31:59,211
Director O, it's me.

469
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,881
You know the youngster among
our interns called Na Jin A...

470
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:06,151
It would good if you could raise her right away
tomorrow to a regular employee status.

471
00:32:06,151 --> 00:32:08,153
Please make that happen for me.
You understand?

472
00:32:08,153 --> 00:32:10,890
Well, that's a bit... heavily problematic.

473
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:11,757
What kind of problem?

474
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:14,159
To do that, we will have to change
the company's personnel policies.

475
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,164
Explaining it to the other interns
will become way too nonsensical.

476
00:32:18,164 --> 00:32:21,834
If we flay the policies like this and make
somebody a regular employee one fine day,

477
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:26,105
from now the personnel policies will be pointless,
it will be a complete mess, discipline-wise.

478
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:29,241
Oh, will that... be so much like that?

479
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:32,111
There is no way out?

480
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:33,779
I'm not sure.

481
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,181
There is no way, I guess.

482
00:32:35,181 --> 00:32:36,382
Is that so?

483
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:39,852
Well, I... understand.

484
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:44,323
What to do?

485
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:52,331
It can be done if it has to be, but... the company's
personnel policies... will need to be broken.

486
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:53,999
I' also think the same way.

487
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:57,536
Even if you were to do that, I would have
requested you to reconsider it.

488
00:32:57,536 --> 00:33:00,272
In an upright way, I will come up 
the ladder on my own abilities.

489
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:14,820
Will this really be all right?

490
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,891
As there is no heating there, 
it will be completely cold at night.

491
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:22,294
But still, it is better than the street, no?

492
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,563
Then we will trouble you temporarily.

493
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:25,965
I'm really thankful.

494
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:29,502
Fine. Then, take rest.

495
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:31,971
- Please take care.
- Please take care.

496
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:08,807
-=Next Episode Preview=-

497
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:11,610
In the garage? How could you think of
bringing some people into the garage?

498
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,013
They have nowhere to go.
They are Soe Dol's family!

499
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:16,749
Adviser, sir. Is the CEO doing all right?

500
00:34:16,749 --> 00:34:19,485
He is fine. If you are asked at 
the company, say he's all right.

501
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:23,555
Ah, I'm frustrated. If all of you
leave for good, what about me?

502
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:25,224
Why do you look so distressed?

503
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:26,225
Is it so obvious?

504
00:34:26,225 --> 00:34:28,627
Mom, I am scared.

505
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:32,298
- Nuna... Miss Jin A. This is No Min Hyeok.
- CEO sir!

506
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:33,899
CEO No Min Hyeok's condition...

507
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,367
Is he at home or at a hospital?

508
