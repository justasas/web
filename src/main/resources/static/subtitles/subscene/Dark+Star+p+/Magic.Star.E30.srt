2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,000
Older Sis, why did you lie to him that he is our worker?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Wasn't the reason that Xiao Dao dares brazenly bully us like that

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,570
because we have no men in the shop?

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,470
I see that lad is pretty good in martial arts.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,600
We can make him stay with us temporarily,

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
then if Xiao Dao comes again,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,300
he would at least have some dread.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But what if he regains his memory?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,600
If he knows we lied to him, he will definitely not stay still!

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,870
Rest assured.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,200
When Older Bro Ying Jun returns, everything will be okay!

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,600
He should be returning soon.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Older Bro Ying Jun has gone to sea for five years,

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,680
and there has been no news about him since.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,800
That huge storm-

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,800
That huge storm overturned their ship,

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,690
only three people survived.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,600
Also, there were 57 bodies that had been found.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,930
Only his whereabouts is unknown.

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,900
This means he is still alive!

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,400
Just because he is missing does not mean he is still alive!

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,700
If nothing happened to him, why hasn't he returned after so many years?

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,830
Older Sis, I know you don't want to face the truth,

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,800
but you cannot continue to lie to yourself like this!

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
You being like this will only harm yourself.

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,490
Xiao Mei, I don't allow you to say such words.

28
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,600
I have a promise with Older Bro Ying Jun.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,600
He said that when he returns he will proudly marry me.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,540
He has never gone back to on his word.

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,700
He will definitely return.

32
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,290
This...

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,770
What stupid place is this?

34
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,230
What is this, seriously.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,530
Can you stop complaining?

36
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,600
It's so irritating.

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,300
What? Pfft.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,800
Sir, you say, this person called what... what, Yu Qi Lin?

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,200
What does he mean?

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,000
He asked to meet us yet delayed his appearance.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
We couldn't have been cheated, right?

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
I hope you got cheated!

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,820
Can you shut up?

44
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,250
Don't make a fuss.

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,000
We will wait awhile more.

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Is it you people who wanted to see Lord Yu Qi Lin?

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Yes.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
My master has something on and is unable to meet you.

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,580
What?

50
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,200
He can't come, right?

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,210
What situation is this?

52
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,400
Do you know how long we waited here?

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
Stop.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,400
We've made an arrangement in advance with your teacher for a map to Yongzhou Underground City.

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,120
Do you know our rules?

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,700
Did you bring the money?

57
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,160
Open the box.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,050
Can you give us the map now?

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,300
Hey, I am the current emperor's younger sister, Princess Zi Su.

60
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,200
These two people are traitor minister Ding Song and his lackey Ma Shun.

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,710
I was kidnapped by them!

62
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,700
You... You cannot believe a word they say!

63
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,150
That... This is my younger sister.

64
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,200
She likes to listen to plays.

65
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,800
She is a play addict and can't get out of it.

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,970
I don't care about the grievances between you people.

67
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,300
Take it.

68
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,110
Hey! You... You see someone in trouble and refuse to help!

69
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,000
You are helping the bad people to do evils!

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,750
Princess, just drop the idea forever.

71
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,000
No one will be able to save you.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,100
You guys... You're all bastards!

73
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,140
Then that's it. We're taking our leave now.

74
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,900
Thank you.

75
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,400
Let's go.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,600
Move!

77
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,300
Seems like he is really here to find someone.

78
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,200
Older Sis!

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,400
You frightened me.

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,800
Older Sis, why don't you go to eat but stay here alone furtively?

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,300
Let me tell you, that Yuan Shuai is really a treasure!

82
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,200
Not only does he know martial arts, but also cooks extremely well!

83
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I think it is comparable to Brother Ying Jun!

84
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Come quickly and try his fried rice with me!

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,300
Younger Sister, here. Please sit down first.

86
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,400
Look at this drawing.

87
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,400
Yuan Shuai?

88
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,400
Is this the brother Older Bro Fei was looking for?

89
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,600
You have to hide this picture and these clothes well.

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
Don't let him find them.

91
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Older Sis, isn't it too much for us to do this way?

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,800
When Older Bro Ying Jun comes back then we will explain to him and let him go.

93
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,600
-But... <br>-No buts.

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,700
Right now, I'm the hostess of this household.

95
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,090
Also, I think you've been too hungry.

96
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,000
Now whatever you eat is delicious to you.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,100
Remember, in this world, no one's cooking can compare to Ying Jun's!

98
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes.

99
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,900
Sir, look. There's a city there!

100
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,400
Right. This is Yongzhou Underground City of the legends.

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
Yongzhou Underground City?

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
Then do those white-skinned people all live here?

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The white-skinned people of legends can only live in Yongzhou Underground City.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Once they go up to the ground and see the sunlight, they will bleed to death.

105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
So this is how it is.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,800
Lord, then what shall we do now?

107
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,380
Let's find a place to rest first.

108
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,900
<i>Older Bro Ying Jun!</i>

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
<i>Older Bro Ying Jun!</i>

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
<i>Don't leave!</i>

111
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,430
<i>Did you have to go? </i>

112
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,000
<i>Stay with me, okay? </i>

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,770
<i>We have such good hot springs.</i>

114
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,600
<i>You're so good in cooking. </i>

115
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,300
<i>We can transform this shop into something great! </i>

116
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,200
<i>Xiao Cai, wait for me. </i>

117
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,200
<i>I will be back in half a year to marry you. </i>

118
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,200
<i>I heard that on the other side of the seas, there is a place where they make spices.</i>

119
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,000
<i>I want to learn from them and bring back their secret methods. </i>

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,580
<i>Then when the time comes we can open this hot spring inn all over the world! </i>

121
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,000
<i>I will become the number 1 chef, </i>

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,400
<i>and you will have unlimited wealth. </i>

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,300
<i>I, Gao Ying Jun, swear that the first thing I'll do upon returning is to marry Xiao Cai! </i>

124
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,570
<i>I will always wait for you.</i>

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,200
<i>No matter how long, I will wait.</i>

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,720
In the middle of the night, you come out pretending to be a ghost instead of sleeping.

127
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,400
Do you plan to scare me to death?

128
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,800
I should be asking you that.

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,200
In the middle of the night, you stand here alone crying instead of sleeping.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,610
Who says I'm alone.

131
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,300
Look!

132
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,990
Hey, Xiao Cai,

133
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,250
have you ever thought about re-opening your business?

134
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,870
Just take care of your own things.

135
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,190
Don't bother about anything else.

136
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
Miss, I'm here!

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,900
- Did you bring the money? <br>- No, I didn't.

138
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,800
Why do you come here if you don't bring money?

139
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,400
Unexpectedly, you're young with a good figure,

140
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,200
but you just want all the rewards without paying the price.

141
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,800
It was because I promised the Em--

142
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,840
I promised her family that I would save her,

143
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,400
and it has to be done with my own abilities.

144
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,000
So... I don't have the face to go back and ask for money.

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,400
So you're going to the Underground City to save someone, right?

146
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,780
Yes.

147
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,200
Could I trouble you to tell Granddaddy Earth?

148
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm really anxious to go to the underground city.

149
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Then when my issue is settled, I will definitely repay him with lots of money!

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Then you tell him yourself.

151
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Granddaddy Earth, please tell me the way to the underground city.

152
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,500
After I rescue my friend, I will definitely repair your entire temple for you!

153
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,400
If I am lying, I will be struck by lightning!

154
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,840
Countries have laws.

155
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,390
Businesses have their regulations.

156
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,400
I will take the money first then help you.

157
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,000
This rule cannot be broken.

158
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,200
Everyone who has come to beg has given me some payment.

159
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,400
You gods, why are you so money-faced?

160
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,800
Fine. I don't believe I cannot find the way on my own accord!

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,870
What kind of god are you?

162
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,600
I'll see you next time!

163
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,900
Buddy, wait!

164
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,200
Ventriloquy?

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,920
I say!

166
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,200
You tell me. Why are you, little lady, not doing anything good,

167
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,190
but come out to fool people like this?

168
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,130
I'm also dumb.

169
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,740
How can I, Zhan Xiong Fei, be tricked by such a low level scheme?

170
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,730
What did you say earlier? What you are called?

171
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,900
Zhan Xiong Fei.

172
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,360
Is your father the Heaven Strategy Envoy, Zhan Ke?

173
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Does he have a sword called the Gray Thunder Edge?

174
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,050
How do you know?

175
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,520
It really is the Gray Thunder Edge.

176
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,760
So... do you know my father?

177
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,640
My dad's Jianghu's code name was Golden Spade.

178
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,870
He is the present empire's top tomb raider.

179
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,220
He and Uncle Zhan Ke have known each other for more than ten years.

180
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,670
Afterwards, when things happened to the Department of Heaven Strategy, we lost contact with your family.

181
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,170
Oh... Then where is your father now?

182
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,150
Last year, when he was raiding a tomb,

183
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,550
his men rebelled against him and injured his arm.

184
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,830
He then just retired from it.

185
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,550
So, do you know how to go to the underground city?

186
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,820
Or does your father know?

187
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,230
Hurry and tell me, please.

188
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,200
The people of the underground city are unable to come out, and they know my father well,

189
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,160
so he often helps them conduct trades.

190
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,450
You can say they know each other well.

191
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,470
That Princess Zi Su you mentioned

192
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,640
was brought there by two people yesterday.

193
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,580
It was me who gave them—

194
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,900
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,080
It seems like Zi Su was really brought to the underground city.

196
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,740
It's okay. It's not your fault.

197
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,920
Can I have one map, too?

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,410
I will go and find them now!

199
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,770
What is Zi Su to you?

200
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,840
Why are you so anxious?

201
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,200
She... She is my good friend.

202
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,080
Then when you were young, did Uncle Zhan Ke mention me?

203
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,690
No.

204
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,160
How is that possible!

205
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,730
We were engaged by our parents when we were in the womb with a babies' marriage agreement.

206
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,410
What?

207
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,470
You are the Baby* Elder Yu Qi Lin?<br>(* baby in the womb)

208
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,680
And you and I have a baby—

209
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,490
B-B-Babies' marriage agreement?

210
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,780
Right. I only found out from my father after I grew up.

211
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,910
You... You... The babies marriage agreement you're talking about is the one I'm thinking about?

212
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,580
Right. That time we lost contact,

213
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,970
I also thought the heavens didn't agree with us.

214
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,920
Now unexpectedly, I've actually seen you again!

215
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,960
It is truly fate!

216
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,030
No, it's not fate.

217
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,170
This is confusing.

218
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,870
This...

219
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,300
Don't worry about that first.

220
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,240
Please give me the map.

221
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,640
I really need to save Zi Su!

222
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,000
Older Brother Xiong Fei!

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,060
Then that means you admit what happened in the past?

224
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,790
I admit... I... What?

225
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,200
Miss Qi Lin, things are like this,

226
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,500
I am just a poor person.

227
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,640
That... We are not compatible.

228
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,320
Compatible! You don't have money, but I have money.

229
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,140
When we are together, we won't lack anything!

230
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,150
You don't have to risk danger anymore, either!

231
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,310
- I... No... <br>- Don't tell me you fell for that princess!

232
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,840
You want to be a prince, is that it?

233
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,250
I...

234
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,990
I am not thinking so much now.

235
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,140
Miss Qi Lin, just take it as I'm begging you. Just give me the map.

236
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,350
Then you have to promise me something.

237
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,230
As long as you don't mention marriage, I will promise you.

238
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,600
Fine then promise me.

239
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,460
If you manage to rescue Zi Su, I want to have a fair competition with her.

240
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,840
Okay?

241
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,970
No... What? Compete for what?

242
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,500
Okay, fine, I promise.

243
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,110
Just give me the map now.

244
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,920
Don't worry. I'll send you there!

245
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,330
Let's go!

246
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,240
What are you doing now?

247
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,350
I am not giving you the money for nothing.

248
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,450
Help me get something.

249
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,680
What?

250
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,250
The pearl powder from Toyo Bay.

251
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,560
Cosmetics?

252
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,290
Of course. I'm earning money for this face!

253
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,390
For the pearl powder from Toyo Bay with this little money,

254
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,740
I don't think...

255
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,090
This is the deposit!

256
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,760
If there is stock,

257
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,050
then I will repay you everything!

258
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,930
Was this money earned from that girl?

259
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,620
Let me tell you, that girl is worth a lot.

260
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,760
I've sold her for so much!

261
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,090
Where is she now?

262
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,760
You also know that I was just asked to come here.

263
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,010
It's that little boy, right?

264
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,370
Has he woken up?

265
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,150
He won't wake up in such a short time.

266
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,550
I've not seen such a foolish act.

267
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,650
He even dared drink the pirate king wine.

268
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,490
Okay, let's talk about that girl A Ji Ya first.

269
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,960
Where is she? I must take her away.

270
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,560
If you don't say...

271
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,870
Your pearl powder...

272
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,540
You are really being serious, aren't you?

273
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,500
I was kidding.

274
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:46,290
If the person is with me, I'll hand her over.

275
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,720
But the point is... that she was taken by Cheng Ming Pan.

276
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,390
She's with Chen Ming Pan?

277
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,750
Right.

278
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,750
Who changed my clothes?

279
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,320
Who do you think?

280
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,190
Do you think you got out yourself?

281
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,800
Boss, men and women should not get too close, how could you—

282
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,610
I got my waiter to do it for you.

283
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,370
Oh, I got scared to death.

284
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,690
How long have I been asleep?

285
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,370
You dreamt of your mother, didn't you?

286
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,090
How do you know?

287
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,330
I must have been sleep talking again.

288
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,440
It was not sleep talking but drunk talking.

289
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,360
I've not seen such a foolish drunk like you.

290
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,850
If you do this again, I will kill you!

291
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,710
After drinking so much... who can remember what he said?

292
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,140
I won't drink next time. I won't drink.

293
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,850
Right.

294
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,490
A Ji Ya is still in Sailors' House.

295
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,350
I need to save her!

296
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,130
She's not there anymore.

297
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,190
Where is she?

298
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,180
Don't be rash.

299
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,980
Listen to me.

300
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,120
Your friend, A Ji Ya,

301
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,540
is with Cheng Ming Pan currently.

302
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,600
Then all the more I must go save her!

303
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,100
Now the most important thing isn't just saving one person, A Ji Ya.

304
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,660
Cheng Ming Pan robbed a government boat.

305
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,900
If I don't hand him to the capital,

306
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,560
not just A Ji Ya, this whole island will be in danger!

307
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,680
Don't worry about the government!

308
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,790
I am worried about A Ji Ya!

309
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,730
Do you think Cheng Ming Pan will obediently hand her over?

310
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,900
- I heard the sailors said that he wants to marry her! <br>- What?

311
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:50,370
KoreanDramaX.co

312
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,410
What are you doing?

313
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,820
Stop the boat! I want to get off!

314
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,090
You aren't allowed to! You need to stay onboard and be my wife!

315
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,260
No way!

316
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,830
I'm telling you!

317
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,390
Here, you have no choice!

318
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,980
Be thankful you have food and clothes now

319
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,240
because I, Cheng Ming Pan, have fallen for you!

320
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,670
What do you like about me?

321
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,480
I'll change it then.

322
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,860
Before I reply you,

323
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,530
can you answer a question of mine first?

324
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,900
You love him, right?

325
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,840
The gaze of a woman who has fallen for a man can be told!

326
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,120
That little pale face also loves you!

327
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,540
For you, even his life can be thrown away!

328
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,490
Don't act like you know everything!

329
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,110
What you said is all fake!

330
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,710
You want the truth!

331
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,130
Fine, I'll tell you.

332
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,600
Actually the person I like is not you,

333
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,490
but sometimes I think you were her.

334
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,530
But I know you are not her.

335
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,790
Because your eyes are always so cold.

336
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,580
But her face always had smiles.

337
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,220
Since you have someone you like, why don't you find her?

338
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,470
Why are you making things difficult for me here?

339
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,480
If I want to find her, I have to die first.

340
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,040
She's dead?

341
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,380
Right! She was killed at such a young age.

342
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,220
I killed her!

343
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,650
You killed her?

344
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,500
That time she was the great missy of a wealthy family.

345
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,250
I was just a poor fishmonger!

346
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,810
After we were together,

347
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:53,880
we decided to go to a place where no one knew us and live out our lives happily.

348
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,990
But good things don't last long.

349
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,310
Not soon after, she got caught and brought back to her house.

350
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,870
I thought that when she got back to her house, she'd continue living her rich lady life.

351
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,110
Her family also promised that they would just treat that this matter didn't happen.

352
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,950
But I never thought that she had gotten pregnant.

353
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,430
Afterwards, they said that she tarnished their family's reputation

354
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:21,210
and actually got cruelly killed by her own father.

355
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,120
The lady that I risked my life to protect with

356
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,040
actually got cruelly killed by her father just because of me and the child in her womb.

357
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,420
Isn't that me killing her?!

358
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,890
Actually, it's not totally your fault.

359
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,800
No! This is my fault!

360
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,850
From then on, I killed her whole family!

361
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,630
All the people in her household, whether old or young, I killed one by one.

362
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,190
From then on, I took pleasure in killing people!

363
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,550
I took pleasure in hearing the sound of their necks getting broken.

364
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,160
I want these cold-blooded people to accompany my wife and child in her death!

365
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,040
You...

366
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,470
Right! This is me!

367
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,120
Afterwards, I escaped onto this island and become a pirate!

368
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,700
In the end, became the captain of this ship!

369
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,500
Right now, it's my turn to ask you.

370
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,200
Does that guy love you the same way I do?

371
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,620
I don't know that.

372
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,190
But I feel that I will never love you

373
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,190
because you are inhumane!

374
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,520
Do you think that agitating me like that will work?

375
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,950
Let me tell you. You can have your choice.

376
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,950
But in here, you can only follow my choice.

377
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,860
My choice is...

378
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,910
- You can never leave this ship!<br>- You...

379
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,780
I can only walk you up to here.

380
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,170
When you reach the underground city, you must be careful.

381
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,280
If you encounter anything, just mention my father's Golden Spade code name.

382
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,130
It should be able to help you.

383
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,190
I know already.

384
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,350
Then... I'm setting out then.

385
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,480
- What's wrong?<br>- About the engagement set years ago, try reconsidering it.

386
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,020
- Qi Lin, that... We—<br>- Hey!

387
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,280
Forget it. I don't want to hear the answer again.

388
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,890
I hope that it would get better one day.

389
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,350
It may become the answer that I want.

390
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,660
Here is the map.

391
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,640
It'll most likely be of use.

392
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,820
Qi Lin, thank you.

393
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,650
- Come! Come!<br>- We're open!

394
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,860
- We're open!<br>- Look here,

395
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,350
- All Seasons Hot Spring!<br>- Come inside and take a look!

396
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,460
Reopening again!

397
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,430
An old shop reopens!

398
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,770
- Customer, look. Our service is very good.<br>- There are discounts for the grand reopening.

399
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,320
If you have any questions regarding–

400
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,650
- It's really very comfortable.<br>- Hey, our shop has reopened. Hurry and take a look.<br>- We are giving discounts.

401
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,140
Look. We even have a new menu.

402
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,170
Hey, hot spring, hot spring. Experience it for a while. Very relaxing.

403
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,040
No. Not interested.

404
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,870
Hey. The outcome isn't that good.

405
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,060
What do we do?

406
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,390
We cannot continue like this anymore.

407
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,410
We must actively make a move and divide the work for it to be effective.

408
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,450
Let's go.

409
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,080
Coming, All Seasons Hot Spring!

410
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,120
- It has reopened.<br>- Let me tell you that All Seasons Hot Spring is really very good.

411
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,820
Big Bro, Big Bro, please look.

412
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,610
Our All Seasons Hot Spring is currently free. Go and try it.

413
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,990
Just go take a look at it.

414
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,670
Hello. Hello. All Seasons Hot Spring. We welcome you to visit our shop.

415
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,280
Thank you. Thank you.

416
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,890
These are are newly renovated springs.

417
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,800
Go and take a look. They're really good.

418
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,600
Thank you. Thank you.

419
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,840
I told you, it won't work.

420
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,610
We ran the whole day and I'm so tired.

421
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,620
And also, we wasted so many papers.

422
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,370
What main theme? What distinction?

423
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,590
It wasn't useful at all.

424
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,330
Enough already. Stop saying it.

425
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,630
After all, there isn't always a good outcome just because you worked hard for it.

426
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,300
Yuan Shuai.

427
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,840
Xiao Mei, don't be that fierce.

428
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,790
After all, it is his first day to be a waiter here.

429
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,040
I don't know if what we did is right or not.

430
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,000
Older Sis, it's not the time to say these things.

431
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,860
You must know that any effort done to protect oneself will eventually be understood by others.

432
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,420
Right now, just with the two of us, if Xiao Dao returns to cause trouble,

433
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,890
then our shop might be taken by him.

434
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,750
If our shop still don't reopen, we really can't continue living anymore.

435
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,880
If we live only upon our capital, there'd be a day of exhaustion.

436
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,190
What smell is that?

437
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,010
So aromatic.

438
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,350
What is that?

439
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,980
I never smelled such aromatic little yellow fish.

440
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,100
What's the use of just smelling delicious?

441
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,570
The absolute truth is that it tastes delicious.

442
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,210
Try it.

443
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,270
How did you do it?

444
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,350
Older Sis, hurry and taste it.

445
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,170
It is so delicious that I am about to cry.

446
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,730
Is that great?

447
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,990
Let me try.

448
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,620
So delicious!

449
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,450
Yuan Shuai, aren't these just ordinary grilled fish?

450
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,670
How come they taste so delicious?

451
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,500
Maybe because you are hungry already.

452
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,360
But to tell you the truth, when it comes to food, I am really an expert.

453
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,990
This is a recipe passed on in our family.

454
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,990
Our family's culinary skills can't be said to be the world's number one

455
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,900
but it can be considered to be among the top ones.

456
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,150
- What thing smells so delicious? Smells delicious!<br>- Where does it come from?

457
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,250
These are all mine. You two must not fight with me for these.

458
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,830
Xiao Cai, Xiao Mei, our first day of reopening the shop indeed isn't that successful.

459
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,370
It's there! There!

460
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,560
Hurry! Hurry!

461
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,350
Hurry! Smells so delicious! Let's take a look at what it is.

462
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,510
What are you doing?! What?

463
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,530
What are you doing?!

464
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,520
- Mine.<br>- Don't fight. Don't fight.

465
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,560
What are you doing?!

466
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,360
That fish is mine! That fish is mine!

467
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,580
- Don't fight! You all stop taking it already! <br>- Lessen the amount that you are taking!

468
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,090
- Everyone, stop fighting to get one already.<br>- What are you all doing?!

469
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,660
- Hey, you all...<br>- My fish!

470
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,670
How can you all be like this? It all got taken away.

471
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,270
I still haven't eaten.

472
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,600
Really so delicious.

473
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,660
- Is there still any left?<br>- There is.

474
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,900
But...

475
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,540
- Are there still any? Owner, are there still any? <br>- Give us one order!

476
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,280
Hey, Xiao Mei. I have thought of an idea.

477
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,450
What idea?

478
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,370
<i>Hurry and give it a try.</i>

479
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,560
- Smells so delicious. Wow, smells so delicious.<br>- Just looking at it and I'm already drooling.

480
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,500
Never seen one like this. That's right. So fun.

481
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,380
Our co-villagers, the fathers and elders, do the grilled fishes smell delicious?

482
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,620
They do!

483
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,760
Do you want to eat one or not?

484
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,210
We want to!

485
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,610
Then listen to me say some words, is that okay?

486
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,780
Okay!

487
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,210
Our All Seasons Hot Spring Inn will start business again soon.

488
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,450
Right now, we are promoting a free hot spring bath activity.

489
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,920
You only need to draw a stick to enter. What stick?

490
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,110
The grilled fish stick.

491
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,240
Five sticks and we will give you tea.

492
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,150
Ten sticks and we will give you free hot spring bath.

493
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,580
Twenty sticks! Sorry for the twenty sticks. We don't have anymore additional freebies.

494
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,310
Because you all can only eat a maximum of twenty sticks.

495
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,780
Let me tell you. Everyone wants to eat.

496
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,160
Everyone can eat one, right?

497
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,430
Leave some to others. Our All Seasons Hot Spring Inn welcomes everyone!

498
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,710
Okay! Good!

499
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,710
Everyone, please pay here.

500
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,320
Please line up.

501
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,220
Come. Come. Pay here.

502
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,600
- Here.<br>- I want five sticks.

503
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,560
Welcome to our shop.

504
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,590
Thank you. Thank you.

505
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,370
- This is yours.<br>- Welcome to our shop.

506
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,650
- Please enter. Please enter.<br>- Here. Yours.

507
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,660
Thank you.

508
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,710
- Is the temperature okay?<br>- It's quite good.

509
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,410
- Come back often.<br>- Okay. Okay.

510
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,870
There are all girls here. Why did you come here?

511
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,440
But someone wanted towels.

512
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,660
Then just give it to me.

513
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,050
Hurry and leave this place!

514
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,780
Go there!

515
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,680
Your grilled yellow fishes are here!

516
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,500
- It's here already.<br>- Come. Please enjoy.

517
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,630
This is our best seller.

518
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,320
Thank you. Thank you.

519
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,190
There are fishes coming!

520
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,870
Customers, here are our grilled fishes.

521
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,560
- It has a special flavor.<br>- Okay. Okay.

522
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,770
Your water is here!

523
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,930
- Not bad, right?<br>- Is the water hot enough? Let's add some more.

524
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,320
Thank you.

525
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,950
Here, for you.

526
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,930
Hot water is coming! Here. Here.

527
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,380
Okay.

528
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,470
This is the hard-earned money we had for today.

529
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,180
Wow!

530
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,700
It's been so long since I saw so much money!

531
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,810
We must thank Yuan Shuai a lot for this.

532
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,920
If not for him, those customers really wouldn't dare enter our shop.

533
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,650
Let's give Yuan Shuai one merit.

534
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,760
It's nothing. Everyone worked hard.

535
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,130
Look. Today is such a happy day.

536
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,350
How about let's toast tea in place of wine and celebrate the reopening of our shop today?

537
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,810
You both said it right.

538
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,310
It's all thanks to Yuan Shuai for helping us resume our business.

539
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,880
From now on, we are a family that shares blessings and goes through danger together.

540
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,380
- Cheers!<br>- Cheers!

541
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,250
Cheers!

542
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,370
This...

543
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,500
How come is like that? Never saw him. Weird.

544
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,010
- He really looks so different from us.<br>- That's right.

545
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,810
<i>- He looks so weird. <br>- That's right.<br>- So scary.</i>

546
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,650
Look. Look. So weird-looking is this guy.

547
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,950
Owner, one bowl of noodles.

548
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,100
There are no more noodles.

549
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,850
No more noodles? Why still open a noodle shop?

550
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,300
There is no seat for you.

551
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,410
Hurry and leave!

552
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,620
No... What do you mean by no seat–

553
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,070
Waiter! Serve the four customers noodles!

554
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,600
Okay!

555
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,410
Fellow customers,

556
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,890
your noodles.

557
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,380
Owner. No noodles, no seats?

558
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,870
Then what are they here for?

559
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,870
No. You cannot be biased.

560
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,280
Little kid, looking at you, I think you are not some bad person.

561
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,690
Let me be straight with you then.

562
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,830
If you just weren't careful and ended up in our underground city,

563
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,100
I urge you to go back using the path you used to come here.

564
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,950
Don't carelessly lose your life here.

565
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,680
Look at what you are saying. I didn't come here to commit crimes.

566
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,820
Don't say frightening things like that.

567
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,890
You little brat.

568
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,070
I was giving you kind advice. How come you are unable to differentiate good from bad?

569
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,170
Owner, I just want to eat a bowl of noodles.

570
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,920
Don't worry. I will surely pay.

571
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,790
It's not a matter of money.

572
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,720
Let me tell you the truth.

573
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,520
I am not selling my noodles to outsiders.

574
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,590
To enter our underground city, you must have someone recommending you.

575
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,680
Or else, based on the rules of our city,

576
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,720
this... If the soldiers saw you, they would catch and forcefully banish you.

577
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,800
You... Do you have someone that recommended you?

578
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,110
Recommended...

579
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,480
That... Golden Spade is my friend.

580
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,960
- Golden Spade?<br>- Right.

581
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,460
The Golden Spade that does trade with us?

582
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,820
Right. It should be him.

583
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,080
Do you... have a proof?

584
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,960
Proof? Oh!

585
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,100
I have the map he gave me.

586
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,870
Without this map, I really wouldn't have been able to enter here so easily.

587
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,860
Here. Is this okay?

588
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,320
Is that okay?

589
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,200
Sure. Sure.

590
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,520
It's enough that you have evidence.

591
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,340
Okay. Come, waiter!

592
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,950
<i>- Yes!<br></i>- Give this customer a bowl of noodles!

593
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,260
<i>Okay!</i>

594
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,790
Hey, owner.

595
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,310
This...

596
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,770
Sit.

597
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,890
It's fine. I just want to ask you some questions.

598
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,160
What do those people carrying weapons do?

599
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,690
They?

600
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,570
They are the most respected Netherworld Assassins.

601
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,120
- Assassins? <br>- They also are the people we depend upon for our livelihood.

602
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,350
How can assassins be the people who provide for your needs?

603
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,710
In our underground city, only the assassins can get out.

604
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,340
They help the people in the world above solve different problems.

605
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,890
The money they earned is our only source of money here.

606
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,180
We depend on this money to exchange for food and items,

607
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,490
that's why we are able to survive here in the underground city.

608
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,390
Wait. How come only assassins can get out?

609
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,420
Can't you normal citizens get out?

610
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:29,010
Since we underground city citizens have never seen sunlight,

611
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,970
our body is full of dark energy.

612
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,860
So when we are exposed under the sun,

613
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,950
we will strangely bleed and die.

614
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,750
Are you saying that people from the underground city will die once they see sunlight?

615
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,430
That's right.

616
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,030
So tragic.

617
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,970
Then... how do the assassins go out?

618
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,780
It is because they have been training martial arts for so many years,

619
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
their bodies are stronger than ours.

620
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:01,550
But even if it's like that, they still have to drink a special medicine before going out

621
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,280
to guarantee that they can stay longer in the outside world.

622
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,770
I understand already.

623
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,020
Hey, right, little kid. What really is your purpose for coming here?

624
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,850
I came here to look for a person.

625
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,840
I was just about to ask you about it.

626
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,030
Sure. Say it. As long as I know it,

627
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,660
I'll tell you all.

628
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,900
That person is my friend.

629
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,090
She is a girl like me with black hair.

630
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,820
She should have been tied up.

631
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,720
Do you find her familiar?

632
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,760
No... didn't see her.

633
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,420
Hurry!

634
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,780
Hurry!

635
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,600
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry...

636
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,940
Move aside! Move aside!

637
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,600
Hurry and get out of the way!

638
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,200
Hurry! Move aside!

639
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Owner, where are those many assassins going to?

640
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,530
They are going to the middle point.

641
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,600
Middle point? What place is that?

642
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Middle point is the place where the netherworld assassins receive their mission.

643
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,900
It is also the place where information is most abundant here in the underground city.

644
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,400
Oh, right! If you are asking around for that lady's information, I suggest you go there to ask.

645
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,600
Okay.

646
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,000
But... if you are going to go there wearing that,

647
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,300
you surely will be arrested and get exiled out of here.

648
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,200
Just think of a way then.

649
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
- Okay. Thank you, owner.<br>- You're welcome.

650
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,900
For that noodle, I'll just...

651
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,070
<i>This underground city is really a strange place.</i>

652
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,000
<i>Is Zi Su really in here?</i>

653
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
<i>I must hurry up and find her</i>

654
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,900
<i>and then take her quickly out of here.</i>

655
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,650
Hey... there's another one.

656
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,200
How come there are so many of them today?

657
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,700
All are strange people. So scary.

658
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,600
Hey, owner. Give me a bowl of noodles.

659
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,800
There are no more noodles.

660
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,900
What?! There are no more noodles?

661
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Let go of me! Let go of me!

662
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,200
My Lady Highness Princess, you better just save your energy.

663
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,400
With this amount of energy, why don't you just go take a nap?

664
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,000
You... Ding Song! You big bad guy!

665
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,500
You... You dared to kidnap me?!

666
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,200
Once I get back, I'll tell my Royal Brother to kill all your clans!

667
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,300
Thank you, Your Lady Highness Princess.

668
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,150
Hey, just be light with her.

669
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,500
For us, she is a treasure.

670
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,500
<i>Customer, is it convenient for me to come in?</i>

671
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,000
Come in.

672
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,100
Customer, your tea.

673
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,960
Please enjoy.

674
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,600
What are you looking at?

675
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,400
I just want to ask if you still have any instructions for me?

676
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,200
- Mr. Waiter.<br>- Yes, please say it.

677
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,300
I want to ask you about something.

678
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,000
Wow! Just say it. Just say it.

679
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,200
If you can answer the question that I'll be asking,

680
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,500
there are still a lot of them.

681
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,000
Just this one is enough to make me say all that I know, to say it nonstop.

682
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,280
Who is the leader of this underground city?

683
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,000
It's of course is our Lord Xiu Fu, the city leader.

684
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,600
The other one will be the miracle doctor Gongsun Miao Quan.

685
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,600
We, the citizens of the underground city, greatly revere them.

686
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,000
Then recently, has your city leader left the city before?

687
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,070
Customer, you don't know this.

688
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,000
We people in the underground city cannot see sunlight.

689
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,960
That's why, we never went out.

690
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,500
Other than those heroic netherworld assassins.

691
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,640
Cannot see the light?

692
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,300
Why?

693
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:53,300
For this... you have to wait for me to clearly explain it.

694
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,200
Lu Yin...

695
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,900
I'm back.

696
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,800
<i>You tell me, if one day your teacher is able to make a drug for us to be unafraid of the sun,</i>

697
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,070
<i>then we can move to the world outside.</i>

698
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,000
<i>That would be great.</i>

699
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,800
<i>Actually, going anywhere is fine with me as long as you're by my side.</i>

700
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,030
<i>You really are so boring.</i>

701
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,400
<i>You don't get interested in anything.</i>

702
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
<i>Of course, there is. For example, I want to be the world's number one assassin.</i>

703
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,500
<i>Then between being the no. 1 assassin and me, you can only choose one.</i>

704
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,170
<i>Who will you choose?</i>

705
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,600
<i>Of course, it's you.</i>

706
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,600
<i>I trained martial arts so that I can protect the people I want to protect.</i>

707
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,800
Do you know that...

708
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,990
in the outside world...

709
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,400
I met a woman. Her name is Huang Qian Xun.

710
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,500
Her personality and attitude is really like yours a lot of the time.

711
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,000
I want to see her. But I tend to always hide very far from her.

712
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Every time I saw her, I kept avoiding.

713
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,300
Because... I don't know what will happen between us in the future.

714
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,100
I also don't know if my heart can open up again.

715
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,700
Lu Yin, what exactly should I do?

716
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,000
Get lost! Get lost! All of you, get lost!

717
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Hurry and move aside!

718
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
These are your fish. Please come inside.

719
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,600
Thank you.

720
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
This flavor is really so aromatic.

721
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,200
Get lost. Get lost.

722
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,120
It's you again!

723
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,100
Why are you here?

724
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,600
Hey, after a single shake, you changed into a chef now?

725
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,170
This Miss Cai is quite in a hurry.

726
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,000
Letting any guy just enter her shop.

727
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,400
I'm warning you.

728
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,990
Hey, don't get agitated.

729
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,400
I came here today but didn't want to use force, either.

730
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,450
So you better just stay obedient.

731
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,000
After I finish with official matters, I will deal with you.

732
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,200
May I ask if Miss Cai is around?

733
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,600
Older Bro Dao is here already and you don't know to come out and welcome him?

734
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,600
<i>Come out, Miss Cai! Come out!</i>

735
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Xiao Dao, if you don't find it troublesome, then I'll tell it to you once again.

736
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,800
I will never sell this shop.

737
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,000
Even if I burn it down, I still will not sell it to you!

738
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,780
Okay. Okay. Not selling. Not selling.

739
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,000
I am not buying it, either.

740
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I came here today is to care about your marriage.

741
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,400
Miss Cao, this Gao Ying Jun has already left for almost 5 years already, right?

742
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,800
For these past years, there has been probably more than ten lads coming here to ask your hand for marriage, right?

743
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,600
Shut up! What does that have to do with you?!

744
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,200
Of course, it concerns me.

745
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,000
I came here today seriously asking Ms. Cai's hand for marriage.

746
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,000
I believe that almost all young lads in this bay have already been rejected by you.

747
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,900
But I think that Ms. Cai will surely not refuse me.

748
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,700
- Older Sis.<br>- Xiao Mei.

749
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,670
Stop trying to take advantage of my boss.

750
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,200
Or else, I'll let you suffer.

751
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,810
Xiao Cai, I am also doing this for your own good.

752
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,000
With such a big family business, you must have a man to manage it with you.

753
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,730
You don't plan to not marry forever, right?

754
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,400
With Gao Ying Jun dying in the seas,

755
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,510
and you keep refusing to get married,

756
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,500
if this gets out, will you end up with having a widow reputation

757
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,200
or some messy rumors?

758
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,600
Clean up your language!

759
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,000
Little beast, shut up!

760
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,210
I will soon be your master later.

761
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,900
Don't aim for a mile when I have already given you an inch and ask me to personally beat you up later.

762
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,800
That's why after thinking about it,

763
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,180
in this area, other than me,

764
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
there really isn't anyone else who can help you out of these troubled seas.

765
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,600
You better just accept these good intentions of mine.

766
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,400
Xiao Dao, what does my reputation have to do with you?

767
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,000
That's right. It indeed can be not my business.

768
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,400
But based on the rule in this bay, there has never been a woman who can inherit the family business.

769
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,300
Since you are not able to inherit your family business, automatically, you can't manage this hot springs inn.

770
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,700
But I am willing to be a good person and do good things to help you manage it.

771
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,400
That's why, I also must have an official title. Isn't that so?

772
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,800
Around here, who doesn't know that I'm sincere towards you?

773
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,950
Then rather than looking for another date, why don't we just set it to today?

774
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,800
Today, just officially be my wife.

775
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,810
How about it?

776
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,600
This way, as one family, we don't need to be against each other.

777
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,200
Pfft! A toad wanting to eat swan meat!

778
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,170
Xiao Mei, take Xiao Cai away first.

779
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,800
I'll deal with this rascal.

780
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,210
I'll let you taste my brush!

781
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,800
Who do you think you are?

782
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,410
You won't behave if I don't teach you a lesson, is that it?

783
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,000
Then I'll let you pay for both old and new grudges today then.

784
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,530
Buddies, attack!

785
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,000
Yes!

786
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:58,000
