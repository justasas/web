[Incheon Nam-dong center live]

2
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:18,617
Survival audition K-pop star season 5.

3
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:23,450
Introducing our TOP 4 who overcame many challenges with their talent and passion.

4
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:26,117
Lee Si-eun!

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,700
Lee Soo-jung!

6
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:28,992
Ahn Ye-eun!

7
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,742
Mazinger S!

8
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:47,908
Give it up for the TOP 4 who came a long way!

9
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:01,092
To tell you the truth, every season,

10
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:03,575
it never went as we expected it to go.

11
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:05,825
Everyone has such distinct styles.

12
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:08,950
A contestant who sings ballad well, a contestant who writes her songs,

13
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:11,367
a contestant with a sense of pop,

14
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:12,742
and a contestant with potentials.

15
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:14,408
Everyone is so different.

16
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,867
There's not a team that's dominant over others right now.

17
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:21,783
So personally this season is the most interesting for me to see.

18
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,408
[Now headed towards the finals!]

19
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:27,408
Could it be? No way.

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,700
100!

21
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:32,450
[Lee Soo-jung received a score of a 100 from Park Jin-young]

22
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:37,742
[She presented the thousands of audience with the best performance!]

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
She has the perfect sense.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,075
And she has the perfect techniques.

25
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:46,408
You know the saying "form is temporary but class is permanent."

26
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,492
Soo-jung is different, she's on a different level.

27
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:56,242
[Ahn Ye-eun performed astonishingly with her song "If Spring comes"]

28
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,492
You look like an already complete artist.

29
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:03,450
I want to say that she's a high-quality artist.

30
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:07,158
Each and every single one of her lyrics and melodies seem real.

31
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:10,117
They're all a work of art.

32
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:17,075
[Lee Si-eun re-interpreted "Sigh" with her unique powerful voice]

33
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:21,283
It's been a while since my heart felt so full by seeing a contestant sing.

34
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:26,742
The moment Si-eun is able to explode her feelings on stage,

35
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:31,533
K-pop star season 5's results become unpredictable.

36
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:36,075
[Mazinger S sang "The two of us" with overflowing energy and perfect harmony]

37
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:39,908
I loved seeing you girls play around while not being tightening up

38
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:41,867
and on top of that your vocals-

39
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,450
I think your performance was simply the best today.

40
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:49,367
The four of them are getting better and better as each of them grow.

41
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:51,492
If they continue this on,

42
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:53,658
they can easily win.

43
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:55,825
[And]

44
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:59,492
[Voting once again for the second time following last week]

45
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,325
[The company each of them want to sign with.. Could they have change their minds?]

46
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,450
[Polls finished!]

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,367
Alright.

48
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:26,908
We took a poll following last week asking the contestants of their choice of company.

49
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:29,533
If I were to give you a tip,

50
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,158
some of their choices have changed.

51
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:35,200
Some team's changed their choice from last week.

52
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:36,950
What do you think Mr. Yoo?

53
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,492
Who do you think changed from where to where?

54
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:47,283
Because it pertains to their life I think they certainly do have to be thoughtful.

55
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:50,700
I'm not sure where they would have changed from and to.

56
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:53,617
Do you think this change would've been beneficial to you or

57
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:54,325
maybe not?

58
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm going to believe that it's going to be beneficial to me.

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
I see.

60
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:02,367
Mr. Yang you raised both of your hands last week

61
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,492
and were confident that everyone will go to your company.

62
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:06,742
What do you think?

63
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,908
I was kidding.

64
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,325
You're saying that now?

65
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:13,783
I'm certain of one thing.

66
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:15,242
It's not Park Jin-young.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,117
Okay. Mr. Park.

68
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:21,617
What do you think?

69
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:22,658
They changed their minds.

70
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:25,658
By the time contestants are to choose their company,

71
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:29,367
I regret all the mean things I've said to them.

72
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,283
Yes yes.

73
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:34,158
I shouldn't have done that in the beginning if I think of this moment,

74
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:37,367
I don't know why I keep giving feedback like that. It's unfortunate.

75
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:38,992
I see.

76
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:42,367
He began to give kind feedback starting from last week.

77
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,242
We'll see what effect it'll have.

78
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,742
Today's K-pop star season 5 is

79
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:47,992
the semi-finalists.

80
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:52,658
I will tell you again that the performances prepared will make everyone go crazy.

81
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:54,617
I'll explain the rules for today.

82
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:58,408
TOP 4 competitions will be a combination of 60% judges' scores and 40% viewer votes.

83
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,742
and 40% viewer's text message votes.

84
00:05:01,783 --> 00:05:07,492
The top 2 teams with the highest scores will continue onto the final rounds next week.

85
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:10,908
The rest of the 2 teams will leave K-pop star after this round.

86
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:14,617
I will now announce the order of performance and contestants' numbers.

87
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:20,867
First, the contestant with the perfect high-quality pop vocal, number 1 Lee Si-eun!

88
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:24,867
She received the highest judge score last week.

89
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,200
Dazzling power R&B singer, number 2 Lee Soo-jung!

90
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:34,283
A developed musician whose popularity is growing sharply. Number 3 Ahn Ye-eun!

91
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,992
The best harmony that produces 3 minutes like a movie.

92
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:40,617
Number 4 Mazinger S!

93
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:46,325
And we also have prepared a special stage today.

94
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,908
The winner of K-pop star season 3,

95
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,117
Bernard Park will reveal his newest song for the first time to you guys.

96
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,283
Look forward to the lovely stage he and Wonder Girl's Hye-rim will be performing.

97

TOP 4 competition will begin soon.

98
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:06,533
As I said before viewers' text votes are 40% of the decision.

99
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,908
This person will explain how to vote by text.

100
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:11,492
Take it away.

101
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:13,992
Hello good to see everyone.

104
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,742
Who are you guys rooting for?

105
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,492
The atmosphere in here is bombastic fantastic!

106
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:28,200
Viewers. Who are you all rooting for?

107
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,450
Are you just rooting for them in your heart?

108
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:32,033
Please don't do that.

109
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:35,908
Please root for them hardcore through your texts.

110
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:41,533
Right this moment text the name or the number of the contestant you're rooting for

111
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:45,742
and please send it to #0606.

112
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:51,325
Your one text can change the fate of the contestant.

113
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:53,408
It's texting time.

114
00:06:53,450 --> 00:07:00,783
Then now, K-pop star season 5 TOP 4's performances will begin!

115
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:04,408
The text votes begin at the same time as well.

116
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:07,367
The first stage will be contestant number 1

117
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:10,450
we have prepared for you Lee Si-eun's stage.

118
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,325
Is everyone ready?

119
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,367

[Park Jin-young is coming to say hello to the contestants]

124
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,825
He's up on the stage.

125
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:40,408
[He goes straight to Si-eun]

126
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,867
He told me that all I needed to do was to relax my shoulders.

127
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:47,075
Don't be so nervous and relax

128
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,283
and sing.

129
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:52,950
He told me that directly, not through a microphone.

130
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:56,825
I was both really surprised and grateful.

131
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,783
[Si-eun is encouraged by Park Jin-young, what song did she choose?]

132
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:05,575
[What does this mean?]

133
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:11,117
Has Si-eun ever drunk alcohol before?

134
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:16,825
[The best song of shy confessions! Jun Ram-hwoi's "Drunk confession"]

135
00:08:16,825 --> 00:08:18,533
I'm worried about one thing.

136
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,492
This song is a bit masculine.

137
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:28,200
I don't know how a female's- or Si-eun's interpretation is going to turn out.

138
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:32,075
[On the other hand]

Ga-kyung you're in middle school now?

151
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:09,325
Yeah.

152
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:13,033
I would've never imagined.

153
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:17,700
I didn't think they would come all the way to cheer me on.

154
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,992
I didn't know they would come.

155
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:25,325
They came with food and everything to encourage me. I was very thankful.

156
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,783
Are their signs that have your name on them too?

157
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:29,575
Yeah.

158
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:30,658
I was surprised.

159
00:09:30,658 --> 00:09:33,658
I didn't think people would make signs for me.

160
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:34,658
But people did.

161
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,867
I was very amazed. The stage is gigantic too.

162
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,992
I had a lot of experiences of me liking someone but I quickly gave up

163
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,742
thinking it wouldn't work.

164
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,408
So I'm thinking a lot about how I should sing this song.

165
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,117
You can maybe imagine that I'm the person you're talking to.

166
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:59,700
Me? You?

167
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,158
Confessing to you?

168
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,283
You two look good together.

169
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,242
You two look good together.

170
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:06,367
What?

171
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,158
Nothing.

172
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,617
I'll pretend like I didn't hear that.

173
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:14,825
It's been hard to think through things alone.

174
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,950
I think they came today to gave me tips.

175
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,408
I think I can do a little better.

176

[Drunk Confession - Jun Ram-hwoi]

179
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,742
Yeah.

180
00:10:55,367 --> 00:11:00,325
Maybe I'm drunk.

181
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:06,200
This might be a mistake.

182
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,908
When morning comes

183
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,408
I might get nervous,

184
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:19,575
because I don't remember anything.

185
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:22,783
Why

186
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:25,825
do I always

187
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:32,992
say the opposite things when I'm with you

188
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:36,117
and regret it later?

189
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:45,492
I'll tell you the truth now I have loved you from the beginning.

190
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,950
This is how much I love you.

191
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:56,992
My not-so-smooth words may be

192
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,075
a bit old-fashioned

193
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:03,325
and fall short of your expectations,

194
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:09,742
but I don't just say these things to anyone.

195
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:17,325
I'm just as awkward as you are.

196
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,950
I can't look at you directly.

197
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:27,117
I'm sorry to say the same things over again

198
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:33,992
but I'm going to tell you everything today.

199
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:42,200
THis is how much I love you.

200
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:47,367
My not-so-smooth words may be

201
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,867
a bit old-fashioned

202
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:54,367
and fall short of your expectations,

203
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:57,408
but I'm not just saying this.

204
00:12:57,492 --> 00:13:01,908
This will

205
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:07,283
never happen again.

206
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:12,825
When the morning comes,

207
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,617
I'm going to once again

208
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:18,825
embrace you and

209
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:22,325
tell you I love you.

210
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,783
I love you.

211
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,325
I love you.

212
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:44,867
I love you.

213
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,825
Drunk confession.

214
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:59,242
We heard Lee Si-eun's version. I wonder what the judges thought.

215
00:14:00,617 --> 00:14:04,783
It wasn't easy for me to tell from the judges' faces.

216
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,992
Which one of you will give a feedback and a score first?

217
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,742
They aren't able to get to the microphones just yet.

218
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:16,075
Mr. Yoo?

219
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:20,075
This was Jun Ram-hwoi's song called drunk confession.

220
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:22,867
This is Kim Dong-ryul's song.

221
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,742
Before I give my feedback,

222
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:30,492
even Kim Dong-ryul finds it difficult to sing this song at his own concert.

223
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:36,075
Because the range of the song is very low and ends up very high.

224
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:40,075
But he finds something more difficult than the range of the song.

225
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:43,575
He says after singing this song he runs out of energy.

226
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:44,783
Because

227
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:48,742
he said that he almost has to risk his life to sing this song.

228
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,367
What's meant by that is

229
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:53,658
if you don't throw in your everything this song is not brought to life.

230
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:56,242
For me, for the first time,

231
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:58,950
I like the

232
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:03,283
strength of your high notes

233
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:06,825
and the stability of your lower notes but

234
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,450
for the first time it sounded bland.

235
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:11,825
To my ears.

236
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:13,075
So

237
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:17,283
in this song's latter part you're really confessing your feelings, while being drunk.

238
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:23,492
I didn't feel like you were confessing but you were just singing.

239
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,992
I felt like I didn't receive any feelings from the song.

240
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,492
You sing well but-

241
00:15:32,492 --> 00:15:36,783
Drunk confession. The story you tell sincerely as you're drunk

242
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:39,700
I didn't necessarily receive that.

243
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,575
Okay.

244
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:41,742
Antenna's score is

245
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,908
Antenna's score. We'll see.

246
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,242
She sang well but she didn't carry the emotions well.

247
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:48,242
90!

248
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,700
Mr. Park Jin-young?

249
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,117
I think you held back too much.

250
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,450
I don't know what it is but

251
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,117
today you've lived 21, 20 years. Right?

252
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:09,742
I feel like you're someone who held back on something a lot.

253
00:16:11,783 --> 00:16:17,033
You've stuffed it too much that your heart has a callous I feel like.

254
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,283
So no matter how much you try to make it tender and move about freely,

255
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:25,325
I feel like you stuffed everything too much, you have a callous and you can't.

256
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,158
Si-eun have you ever yelled and gotten angry with someone when you felt anger?

257
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,992
Have you ever full-on cried when you were sad?

258
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:38,117
Have you ever confessed to anyone drunk because you like someone so much?

259
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:42,033
So you've never done any of these things before.

260
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,075
How would you be able to carry that in a song?

261
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:49,283
From now on, regardless of the results, I'd like you to encourage your emotions.

262
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:52,367
When you're happy, encourage your happiness.

263
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,658
When you're sad, encourage your sadness.

264
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:58,158
If you don't make these callouses more tender,

265
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:02,742
not matter how good you are at singing there's a limit to you moving someone's heart.

266
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:05,617
I think it starts now but

267
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:06,867
it's not about the vocals.

268
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:09,117
I really feel it now, it's not your singing.

269
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,700
Encourage your emotions on a daily basis.

270
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:14,825

00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,367

272
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:19,158

273

274
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:25,242
Now we have Mr. Yang left to give her feedback.

275
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:28,533
Last week,

276
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:31,367
after the live performances ended,

277
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,242
I heard Park Jin-young called his mother.

278
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:37,992
Your mom called you?

279
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,242
His mother said,

280
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:44,658
Try to say good things to Lee Si-eun as much as you can.

281
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,242
You can't do that man. I mean, never mind the man.

282
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,075
That happened but I think Jin-young is a very consistent person.

283
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:58,075
Seeing him criticize Si-eun again after what his mother told him

284
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:00,700
I thought "he's a very consistent person."

285
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,075
She'll call him again too then.

286
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,908
Okay. What the two of them are saying are similar.

287
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,658
There's nothing more we expect from you in terms of your vocals.

288
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:17,575
It's very difficult to increase your vocal skills but

289
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,992
I think it's more difficult to know how to express your feelings.

290
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:26,850
Especially for a singer on top of your vocals, emotion expression should come before.

291
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:30,200
I thought you could've been better in that aspect as well but

292
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,367
it's also true that you're still very good at singing.

293
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:41,325
And here and there I heard for the first time some R&B styles of singing.

294
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:43,992
I gave you a higher score than you'd expect.

295
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:44,992
YG's score is-

296
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,367
Alright. YG's score.

297
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,658
There is nothing to question about her vocals, it's true.

298

Thank you.

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,617
We looked at hats

327
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:37,533
and we saw how they made Korean popcorn.

328
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:41,242
I liked it.

329
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:45,908
I did everything for the first time with grandma. I love it.

[Park Jin-young's "The house you live in"]

335
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,158
I always sing sad songs

336
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,033
so this time

337
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:11,325
I wanted to do a song that was a little crazy.

338
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:15,533
I thought of JYP first as soon as I thought that.

339
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
JYP is

340
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:18,283
always

341
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:19,867
like his feet

342
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:22,367

343
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:24,950
He always says those things so

344
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,158
because I can sing this song

345
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,367
a little bit more crazily

346
00:21:32,408 --> 00:21:35,075
so I chose this song.

347
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,867
[Looking at Soo-jung's song choice..]

348
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:42,950
She's scary, really.

349
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:45,033

350

Despite the fact that she's not perfectly fluent in Korean,

351
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:49,992
despite the fact that she has a little bit of the accent,

352
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:53,283
it's scary how the lyrics hit you before you can realize that.

353
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:56,658
You continue to sing Korean pop.

354
00:21:56,783 --> 00:22:00,450
To tell you the truth, compared to other contestants,

355
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:05,742
I need more time to prepare for Korean songs.

356
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,283
It's hard but

357
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,117
if I don't do the hard things

358
00:22:09,325 --> 00:22:10,325
you don't grow.

359
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:13,742
If you just do the same things you stay the same person.

[2 Lee Soo-jung]

361
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:29,367
[That house you live in - Park Jin-young]

362
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:46,825
In front of my car stopped at the red light on a crosswalk,

363
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:52,783
holding the hand of a pretty child who looks like you,

364
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,283
you were crossing and after seeing you

365
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:08,033
I was so surprised I followed you.

366
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:13,408
In a cozy little house,

367
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:20,200
everything I see through the window

368
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:25,033
I can tell they're cared for by you.

369
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:28,492
On a white table,

370
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,533
you are setting the food that you made

371
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:40,158
with your pretty hands.

372
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:42,658
Is this a dream?

373
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,950
That house that you live in,

374
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:50,325
that house should've been mine.

375
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,992
That car that you drive,

376
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,908
that car should've been mine.

377
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:58,033
The food that you prepared,

378
00:23:58,742 --> 00:24:01,450
even the child you have in your arms,

379
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:04,575
they should've all been mine.

380
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:08,617
They should've been all my kids.

381
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,658
I still

382
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:16,992
feel like you're my man.

383
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:26,200
I still really feel like you're my man.

384
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:30,450
You've become someone else's man

385
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:33,783
and the kid's dad,

386
00:24:34,117 --> 00:24:40,117
and making me just stand here not being able to do anything.

387
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:44,283
That house that you live in,

388
00:24:44,575 --> 00:24:47,200
that house should've been mine.

389

That car that you drive,

390
00:24:50,117 --> 00:24:52,658
that car should've been mine.

391
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,617
The food that you prepared,

392
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:58,408
and even the kid that you're holding,

393
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:00,867
they should've all been mine.

394
00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:04,242
They should've all been my kids.

395
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:09,075
That house that you live in.

396
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,783
That house should've been mine.

397
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,533
That house should've been mine.

398
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,867
The food that you prepared

399
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:22,867
and even the kid that you're holding,

400
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,408
they should've all been mine.

401
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,450
They should've all been mine.

402
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:35,867
That house that you

403
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:40,033
live in.

404
00:25:49,867 --> 00:25:54,533
We just heard "That house that you live in" with a whole different feel.

405
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,908
Park Jin-young began to move his head again.

406
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:00,658
What will he say?

407
00:26:02,617 --> 00:26:05,325
Soo-jung while you were singing "Lies"

408
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,033
you ended up crying.

409
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:09,825
Right?

410
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,700
Never in K-pop star did a contestant cried consumed by their emotions. Right?

411
00:26:13,825 --> 00:26:15,200
It was the first time.

412
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:20,908
A person's.. mind?

413
00:26:21,117 --> 00:26:23,825
What we usually call a soul.

414
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:25,700
Honestly this is-

415
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:30,783
I think you have to divide the two.

416
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:31,783
It's

417
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
both the mind and the spirit.

418
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:38,700
What the mind does

419
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,742
can be all done by a computer.

420
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,367
They can do it even better.

421
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:46,533
But what the spirit does

422
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:50,658
is completely different, because the root of the spirit is love. It's love.

423
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:55,908
But a computer does not know love

424
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:56,908
so

425
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,700
it can never do what a spirit does.

426
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:03,408
So if you're competing a computer for singing

427
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:07,033
and you begin to cry, what does the computer do?

428
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:11,075
It probably won't know why you're crying.

429
00:27:11,658 --> 00:27:13,158
You're getting what he's saying right?

430
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,742
Yes.

431
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:14,492
Okay.

432
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:16,867
I just thought I should check.

433
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,700
What I wanted to say is-

434
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:21,242
There's this weird thing that love does.

435
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:25,658
It makes you cry during a song, destroying your notes and your beat.

436
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,575
And because of that we cry too, as the audience.

437
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,867
So if you sing just like that

438
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:35,617
you'll become a singer a machine cannot mimic.

439
00:27:35,783 --> 00:27:36,783
Today

440
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,117
it

441
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:40,367
feels like you sang with your mind and not your spirit.

442
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,533
It seemed like you were less crazy.

443
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:43,783
You lacked in that.

444
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:46,825
Because that stage, those stages left with me such a big impression.

445
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:53,742
I hope I can see you on stage singing with an inspiration again.

446
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:55,450
-Thank you. -JYP's score is-

447
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,867
He's expecting a lot from her so he's telling her these things.

448
00:28:00,242 --> 00:28:00,950
95!

449
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:02,658
A high score as expected.

450
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,367
We'll hear from the next judge.

451
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:07,533
Mr. Yang?

452
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:13,992
Jin-young and I love R&B so much to begin with.

453
00:28:14,408 --> 00:28:18,283
You arranged the song that you sang today really well.

454
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:22,200
I tell you that you arranged it well because

455
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,950
you could've sang it with the multiplied emotions but

456
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,825
as Jin-young just said

457
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:35,075
it is true that you fell a little short in delivering your emotions as we expected.

458
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,075
For me, every time I hear "That house that you live in," I think of

459
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:42,575
Jin-young's dance move.

460
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,700
My least favorite dance move.

461
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:49,367
He says everyday to the contestants

462
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:51,950
to not sing obviously.

463
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:55,867
How obvious is this dance move? That house that you live in.

464
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:59,325
I was hoping that you'd please not do that dance move

465
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,367
and I'm glad you didn't.

466
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,408
So I gave you the appropriate score.

467
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,617
YG's score is-

468
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,617
That could've been close.

469
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:07,908
YG's score!

470
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:11,325
94!

471
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:12,367
Thank you.

472
00:29:12,658 --> 00:29:13,825
A high score again.

473
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:15,242
Okay now Mr. Yoo?

474
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,242
We'll hear his feedback and his score.

475
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:20,867
Soo-jung came from Chicago.

476
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,700
And in Chicago,

477
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:25,242
I once heard a song that you worked on

478
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:28,533
with a couple of friends that do music there.

479
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:34,992
But they didn't do songs that were too wide in the range, it was rather typical

480
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,742
and sang songs with the mood usually.

481
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,992
The part you most changed in after Soo-jung came to K-pop star is that

482
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:47,075
you began to sing songs with a drama, ones with a climax.

483
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:53,033
In doing so, you began to challenge yourself to songs that requires you to sing high.

484
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,867
The part I was surprised the most by you during training-

485
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:59,367
I see it today too in this song.

486
00:29:59,575 --> 00:30:03,075
The part when you say "like you're my man, like you're my man,"

487
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:07,658
you change the key and vary the music a little bit.

488
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:14,242
If the arranger says "sing it like this," other singers sing it that way.

489
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,242
But she knows how to bring it back to her.

490
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:20,658
She gives many ideas as to how to sing the song.

491
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:23,783
And in today's song,

492
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:29,117
I saw you lead the song with your own arrangements and style.

493
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:36,367
When you become a professional, you'll be a musician and a vocalist many will love.

494
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:38,450
I can't help but to think that.

495
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,658
Antenna's score is-

496
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:42,908
Okay. A musician and a vocalist.

497
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,283
It was a praise.

498
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,283
Antenna! 94!

499
00:30:46,283 --> 00:30:47,158
Thank you.

500
00:30:47,158 --> 00:30:50,992
A total score of 283. She ended up with a high score.

00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,867
[It feels good but also embarrassing]

532
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:50,158
[Ye-eun we really wanted to see you]

533
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:54,033
Little giant!

534
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,367
Go Ahn Ye-eun!

535
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,533
Go Ahn Ye-eun!

00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:01,200
[The little giant is confused]

537
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:03,658
What do I do?

538
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:11,158
I am about a hundred times more thankful than I may look.

539
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:15,200
I never have imagined that anything like this would happen.

540
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:20,658
I was thinking just on the way what song I should sing for all of you.

541
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,033
I thought probably no one has heard the full version of this song.

542
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,325
I'll sing "Hong-yeon" for you first.

543
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,158
[The fans go crazy to hear the song they wanted to hear]

00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:51,367

548
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:59,617
a string connects them from one's finger to another's.

549
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:02,117
[Her favorite purple flower]

550
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:05,783
I think this is really really much more than I deserve.

551
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:12,117
Honestly I didn't care too much about the results of the competition before

552
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:17,783
but to see all these people I'm thankful for

553
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:25,200
I'm thinking now that I should do well, even if it's for them at least.

554
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:30,033
[What song did Ye-eun write this time for her encouraging fans?]

555
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:34,283
My goodness.

556
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,533
Goodness.

557
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:39,408
It's a lot.

558
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:40,742
Pushover?

559
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,700
She means that kind of pushover I am thinking of, right?

560
00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:51,492
People call someone who foolishly give their everything to others pushover.

561
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:58,158
When you're dating a lot of the times there's a power dynamic between two people,

562
00:34:58,158 --> 00:34:59,158
So

563
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:04,367
I tried to write about a story of someone who is overly compensating,

564
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:08,617
someone who's pitiful to the point their mental health is in danger.

565
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:14,408
[3 Ahn Ye-eun]

566
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:22,617
[Pushover - Written by self]

567
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:30,117
Love is so difficult.

568
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:35,742
You can neither drift away nor get accustomed.

569
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:43,367
I still don't know

570
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:48,117
how I'm supposed to do this.

571
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:56,825
To fit your taste, I

572
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,783
have even been a locksmith.

573
00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:10,117
To be face-to-face with you once more, I-

574
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:17,033
have even been a blank check.

575
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:23,700
I can't help but to love you.

576
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,033
Even when you're smiling brightly with someone else.

577
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:37,408
I don't have a choice but to love you.

578
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:40,783
My air, my sun

579
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:45,408
you're like a poison I cannot quit.

580
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:56,367
Because I don't want to fight with you, I

581
00:36:58,033 --> 00:37:01,408
have even been a framed convict.

582
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:09,867
To spend even a minute more with you, I

583
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:16,242
have even been a taxi driver.

584
00:37:20,408 --> 00:37:26,575
I can't help but to love you.

585
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:33,450
Even if my time with you disappears more and more.

586
00:37:54,575 --> 00:38:00,533
I can't help but to love you.

00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:07,450
Even if I won't be able to see your heart because I'm blinded by you.

I don't have a choice but to love you.

589
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:17,075
My saving grace, my heaven,

590
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:20,867
an early dawn making me want to get drunk,

591
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,950
like a trap

592
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:26,825
I cannot escape.

593
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:38,200
Again she filled her semi-finalist stage with a unique self-written song.

594
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,867
Ye-eun. This way please.

595
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:44,950
We just listened to a song called "Pushover."

596
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,408
Which one of you will talk first?

597
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,242
Mr. Park.

598
00:38:52,492 --> 00:38:56,492
Every time I saw Ye-eun perform I have said that they seem like a work of art.

599
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,158
As I've said before the-

600
00:39:01,575 --> 00:39:02,575
just-

601
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:07,367
she didn't make it with just her mind, it's spirit-like, very unique.

602
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:10,158
Something that's inside of her, the strangeness

603
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:13,658
that cannot be seen is incorporated into her song.

604
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:16,158
I told you if I were to choose a color it was like purple.

605
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:20,117
Today it just feels like green? Or blue?

606
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:22,575
The lyrics were

607
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:25,450
not as different

608
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,742
and unique as I thought.

609
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:33,950
The music too, the chords, melody, in any aspect-

610
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:38,783
That unique aspect of you that we cannot see. Your mind?

611
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:41,325
What is she thinking inside?

612
00:39:41,658 --> 00:39:46,325
What does her mind look like? How does she come up with music like that?

613
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:47,867
I wasn't curious today.

614
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:51,367
I think it's because my expectations have risen.

615
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:55,158
I'm already expecting this much from you to begin with.

616
00:39:55,742 --> 00:40:00,700
The lyrics fell short of what I expected and the music was more simple than expected.

617
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:03,825
I felt like the purple lost a little bit of its color today.

618
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:09,158
But it doesn't make sense for you to write a song every week either.

619
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,908
It's amazing what you're doing.

620
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,908
JYP's score is-

621
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,825
We'll see JYP's score-

622
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:16,950
What is it?

623
00:40:16,992 --> 00:40:17,992
88!

624
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:19,408
Thank you.

625
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,242
Let's hear from the next judge.

626
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,450
Is it Mr. Yang Hyun-Suk?

627
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:32,658
Last week, I said that I felt like I was looking at

628
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:39,783
more of a developed musician than a contestant.

629
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:46,033
Despite that something that I was curious about was

630
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:51,117
because you have the characteristics of a very unique musician,

631
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:56,825
after the K-pop star ends will Ahn Ye-eun

632
00:40:57,492 --> 00:40:59,992
be able to approach the mainstream audience?

633
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:04,783
I did sit and think about whether she'll be able to become a mainstream artist or not.

634
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:13,325
I think it's true your song today wasn't as unique as your songs before.

635
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:17,033
Because since these shows are live you only had a week.

636
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:19,908
Park Jin-young

637
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:23,950
said that it was like the purple color changed

638
00:41:24,492 --> 00:41:25,658
but I don't think

639
00:41:27,325 --> 00:41:30,117
it's great if all of the flowers

640
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:32,367
are purple.

641
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:37,908
Today I realized that Ye-eun can right songs for the mainstream audience.

642
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:44,117
Today's song was like the baby's breath flowers that surround the purple flower.

643
00:41:44,242 --> 00:41:45,825
So actually

644
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:49,242
because you've been so unique in all rounds,

645
00:41:49,408 --> 00:41:53,158
I was actually able to see something other than those songs

646
00:41:53,283 --> 00:41:55,658
I'm hopeful today in regards to the question I had

647
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:58,867
about whether you'll be able to connect with the mainstream audience.

648
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:01,033
I think I was glad to hear today's song.

649
00:42:01,033 --> 00:42:02,367
Okay. YG's score is-

650
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:04,075
YG's score.

651
00:42:04,075 --> 00:42:07,367
He said that he was able to see that she has potential for mainstream music.

652
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:08,867
YG. 95!

653
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:10,742
It's a high score.

654
00:42:10,742 --> 00:42:11,908
Yoo Hee-yeol?

655
00:42:13,783 --> 00:42:16,158
It's the semi-finals. Now.

656
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,992
It's the TOP 4 and

657
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:20,408
if you do well here you'll go to the finals.

658
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:25,242
Something that I'm very surprised by Ye-eun.

659
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:32,408
I think it's amazing how she dares to compete every round with her own song.

660
00:42:32,908 --> 00:42:37,325
Normally you'd try to be mainstream. If it's a competition, an audition,

661
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:39,075
I thought to some degree

662
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:40,408
you'd compromise but

663
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:42,867
you never do so

664
00:42:43,658 --> 00:42:46,908
I thought that your guts were something to be recognized for.

665
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:52,533
When you sang "If Spring comes" last week I was personally very worried.

666
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:54,700
Because your last song

667
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,242
it didn't feel like the song was reaching out to me first.

668
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:02,367
The message came to me first. But today I hear the music first.

669
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:07,200
So I thought that was a relief in a way.

670
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:11,575
I read into your lyrics more closely today Ye-eun.

671
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,950
Your title is Pushover.

672
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,450
You wrote about love but

673
00:43:16,908 --> 00:43:18,367
if you just look at the lyrics

674
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,325
it sounds like it could happen to someone

675
00:43:20,783 --> 00:43:25,825
but the perspective you have to daringly title this song Pushover.

676
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:27,575
I was astonished by that honestly.

677
00:43:27,825 --> 00:43:30,158
There's this part in the lyrics

678
00:43:30,408 --> 00:43:34,033
to spend even a minute more with you, I have even been a taxi driver.

679
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:38,867
You can't help but to run to the person. As you've said it's an illness.

680
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:44,700
I think it's a song only a person who's been the weaker person in love can write.

681
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:46,908
I really like this song personally.

682
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:49,492
It felt like a really sad song.

683
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:52,242
It's a song that only Ahn Ye-eun can sing.

684
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:54,742
But the arrangement of the song could have been better.

685
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:56,658
Because you're not a professional yet.

686
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:58,075
Okay. Antenna's score is-

687
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,325
Antenna's score.

688
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:02,992
What will it be?

689
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:04,575
Out of 100, 95!

690
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:07,575
A total of 278.

691
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,283
If you're rooting for Ahn Ye-eun,

692
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:15,033
please text the number 3 or Ahn Ye-eun to #0606.

693
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:17,825
Alright. Number 3 Ahn Ye-eun everyone!

694
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:25,158
You're watching K-pop star season 5's semi-final stages.

695
00:44:25,283 --> 00:44:28,950
As of now you've seen 3 of the 4 TOP 4 stages.

696
00:44:28,992 --> 00:44:31,325
Just looking at the judges' scores right now

697
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:35,075
Lee Soo-Jung with the score of 283 is in the lead.

698
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:38,575
We only have left Mazinger S' stage at this point.

699
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:45,700
But because the final scores reflect 40% of the audiences' text votes,

700
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:48,908
please participate now if you haven't.

701
00:44:48,908 --> 00:44:52,575
Okay then this is the last stage of today's semi-final stages.

702
00:44:52,575 --> 00:44:54,533
Number 4 Mazinger S!

[Park Jin-young receives Mazinger S' song selection]

704
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,575
Song selections are really important for Mazinger S.

705
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:07,533
What?

706
00:45:09,992 --> 00:45:14,617
Finally came an opportunity to see each of the member's voices.

707
00:45:16,408 --> 00:45:20,533
[Hero - Mariah Carey. Very powerful and emotional ballad song]

708
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:24,033
Our group's name is Mazinger.

709
00:45:24,242 --> 00:45:28,158
It stands for "Real singers who want to move people's hearts"

710
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:32,658
but we felt like we haven't sung any songs to move people's hearts.

711
00:45:37,825 --> 00:45:40,658
[Can we express the deep emotions incorporated into this song?]

712
00:45:40,658 --> 00:45:42,825
I think some people could tell us that.

713
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:45,992
Why are you guys abandoning what you've been doing so well

714
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,700
at a critical point like this and choose to take a risk?

715
00:45:48,742 --> 00:45:50,033
People might say that.

716
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:51,867
So I want us to do this even better.

717
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,950
Yeah.

718
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:55,117
Nervous shake.

719
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,200
We said let's think of this as our last stage and not regret in our song choice

720
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:05,033
so we chose a song that would force us to compete only with our vocals with no dance.

721
00:46:05,825 --> 00:46:07,325
We're going to do our best.

722

[4 of them return to the dorms after a late night practice]

724
00:46:19,325 --> 00:46:20,325
What are these?

725
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:21,992
Hi.

726
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,825
[A table full of warm food]

727
00:46:29,075 --> 00:46:30,242
Wait.

728
00:46:32,158 --> 00:46:33,158

731
00:46:44,908 --> 00:46:45,992
Were you hungry?

732
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,075
Ye-rim sweetie.

00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:50,158
[They missed the warm embrace of parents]

734
00:46:51,867 --> 00:46:56,825
Because you haven't eaten home-cooked meals, your mom made your favorite egg rolls

[Eating mom's food for the first time in months]

737

When I was your age

738
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,783
there was something called the College music festival.

739
00:47:18,825 --> 00:47:19,908
College Music Festival?

740
00:47:19,908 --> 00:47:20,408
You know it?

741
00:47:20,408 --> 00:47:21,617
-MBC? -Hey!

742
00:47:24,492 --> 00:47:26,033
Why didn't you tell me?

743
00:47:26,492 --> 00:47:28,700
My mom made 2nd place there back then.

744
00:47:28,992 --> 00:47:31,158
You girls are going through hard times right now.

745
00:47:31,158 --> 00:47:33,867
Going out early in the morning and coming back late at night. Right?

746
00:47:33,992 --> 00:47:36,283
What you girls are doing

747
00:47:36,617 --> 00:47:38,783
is really good practice I think.

748
00:47:38,783 --> 00:47:39,783
Right?

749
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:44,658
I hope you girls do well on the TOP 4 stage so you won't regret anything.

750
00:47:44,658 --> 00:47:48,158
I'd like you all to have confidence while doing it.

751
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:49,950
I'm really really proud.

752
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:53,158
Thank you so much.

753
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,700
I felt really proud.

754
00:47:56,242 --> 00:48:03,450
I thought it was a really proud moment for my parents.

755
00:48:03,492 --> 00:48:09,492
I want to do even better now that my parents are here.

[Hero - Mariah Carey]

758
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,950
They showed us a perfect harmony as usual.

759
00:52:09,992 --> 00:52:11,783
Number 4 Mazinger S.

760
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:16,075
We'll hear from the judges the scores and feedback.

761
00:52:16,908 --> 00:52:17,908
Mr. Yoo?

762
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:23,158
For the first time, Mazinger S didn't do what they were the strongest in.

763
00:52:24,283 --> 00:52:28,408
They chose to face the challenge directly with this world-renowned ballad

764
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,117
the 4 of them harmonized to the song.

765
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:39,700
You girls had behind you a string orchestra and even a large choir.

766
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:43,575
You put together a stage with a full band on this live stage.

767
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:44,950
Okay.

768
00:52:46,533 --> 00:52:53,783
Over 50-60 people appeared behind you girls on the stage.

769
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:56,742
The main characters should've been just four

770
00:52:57,658 --> 00:53:00,033
but I don't know if you girls beat them in that.

771
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:05,658
I can see that you girls worked hard on harmonizing and individually but-

772
00:53:06,075 --> 00:53:10,950
With this large of a stage you have to sing really well.

773
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:13,992
In that aspect I'm a little disappointed.

774
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:15,158
And

775
00:53:15,617 --> 00:53:20,408
you girls did just what I expected dividing them perfectly as I expected.

776
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:22,575
And in that aspect too

777
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:28,783
it kept falling short of my expectations so I think it could've been better.

778
00:53:28,783 --> 00:53:31,117
But you guys worked really hard.

779
00:53:31,283 --> 00:53:32,492
Antenna's score is-

780
00:53:32,658 --> 00:53:34,700
Okay. Antenna's score.

781
00:53:35,742 --> 00:53:37,742
Out of 100, what would it be?

782
00:53:37,783 --> 00:53:38,783
89!

783
00:53:39,117 --> 00:53:40,117
Thank you.

784
00:53:41,158 --> 00:53:42,742
Next. Mr. Park Jin-young.

785
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:47,908
Individual vocals were better than I expected.

786
00:53:50,283 --> 00:53:53,325
Actually I heard Yuyu Liu sing properly for the first time.

787
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:57,158
Except for the short-breathing and faltering notes it was better than expected.

788
00:53:57,158 --> 00:53:58,867
The rest of you sang well too.

789
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:03,575
But as I'm saying it seemed like you were singing in your right minds.

790
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:09,867
How can we have you sing not with your mind but with your spirits dancing-

791
00:54:11,992 --> 00:54:12,992
How?

792
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:21,158
If you add the "in" in front of spirit it becomes inspiration.

793
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:22,533
Inspiration?

794
00:54:23,158 --> 00:54:27,533
While singing this song called Hero, be crazy about the lyrics.

795
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:29,825
I think I want to see you sing with your minds lost.

796
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,533
I was disappointed in that aspect.

797
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:33,158
JYP's score is

798
00:54:33,408 --> 00:54:34,700
Okay. JYP's score-

799
00:54:35,783 --> 00:54:38,575
He's talking a lot about spirits today.

800
00:54:39,117 --> 00:54:40,117
90!

801
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:43,492
Next is Mr. Yang Hyun-Suk.

802
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:46,908
We'll hear our last feedback and score.

803
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:52,033
Because I'm a producer

804
00:54:52,242 --> 00:54:54,408
Jin-young is one as well but

805
00:54:55,158 --> 00:55:00,825
I do consider that you only have a week to prepare for a live performance.

806
00:55:02,242 --> 00:55:04,158
Viewers only see results but

807
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:09,158
because I see how hard it must've been to prepare all of this,

808
00:55:09,658 --> 00:55:15,783
honestly for 4 people to practice together for a week and not just individually

809
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:19,158
if you compare it to running it's like having all your legs tied.

810
00:55:19,158 --> 00:55:21,325
So teamwork is really important.

811
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:25,783
I think that the time given and the conditions could not have everything be perfect.

812
00:55:26,575 --> 00:55:29,325
Because the 2 of them already said the criticisms,

813
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:31,242
to say something positive,

814
00:55:31,783 --> 00:55:34,992
the girl groups with 4 members right now

815
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,325
I don't know how many there are but

816
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:39,992
will they be able to sing as well as Mazinger S?

817
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:42,908
With all 4 of them?

818
00:55:43,575 --> 00:55:49,283
Even more so those girl groups practice for months to prepare one song.

819
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:54,117
I think it's amazing you girls can come up with this much in only a week.

820
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:56,117
And I

821
00:55:56,617 --> 00:55:58,783
want to praise Joyce Lee's vocals

822
00:55:59,783 --> 00:56:02,408
especially.

823
00:56:02,908 --> 00:56:05,950
I think she's leading the other 3 well.

824
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:09,575
I thought it was good today. YG's score is-

825
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,158
He had more good things to say. YG's score-

826
00:56:12,408 --> 00:56:13,492
What will it be?

827
00:56:13,575 --> 00:56:14,575
Out of 100

828
00:56:14,825 --> 00:56:15,658
YG.

829
00:56:15,658 --> 00:56:16,658
94!

830
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,700
Thank you.

831
00:56:17,992 --> 00:56:20,242
A total score of 273

832
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,283
If you're rooting for Mazinger S

833
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:28,492
please text the number 4 or Mazinger S to #0606.

834
00:56:28,825 --> 00:56:31,158

All of the TOP 4 performances have taken place.

At this point,

838
00:56:43,742 --> 00:56:49,825
Lee Soo-Jung with a score of 283 is in the lead.

839
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:53,408
But we cannot be sure of the results yet.

840
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:58,033
The text votes are coming in close with each team.

841

Who would you like to see on the final stage?

842
00:57:02,492 --> 00:57:03,950
Don't tell me.

843
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:07,075
Please express it in your text messages.

844
00:57:07,117 --> 00:57:10,658
As we're waiting for the viewers text votes,

845
00:57:10,742 --> 00:57:13,992
we have prepared for you a special stage.

846

Everyone you are in luck today.

847
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:20,408
He is coming, the winner of season 3.

848
00:57:20,992 --> 00:57:26,575
Bernard Park has returned with a fuzzy song to go along with Spring.

849
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:32,950
And today he's prepared a special stage with Wonder Girls' Hye-rim.

850
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,658
Are you guys curious?

851
00:57:35,367 --> 00:57:37,242
We'll meet them now.

852
00:57:37,242 --> 00:57:40,283
K-pop star!

853
00:57:45,783 --> 00:57:50,867
Bernard Park & Hye-rim (Wonder Girls)

854
00:57:54,533 --> 00:57:58,908
[I see you - Bernard park & Hye-rim]

855
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,492
I see you

856
00:58:05,992 --> 00:58:08,325
you're far away but

857
00:58:08,533 --> 00:58:12,283
I can recognize you.

858
00:58:13,158 --> 00:58:15,867
You look very small but

859
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:20,033
I know that you're smiling.

860
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,117
You're getting closer.

861
00:58:26,408 --> 00:58:32,783
You who are so lovely gesturing to me.

862
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:41,033
I get more and more nervous so I only smile awkwardly.

863
00:58:43,117 --> 00:58:47,033
You look me in the eyes

864
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:51,908
and hold my hands naturally

865
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:58,117
and even if I don't tell you where we're going

866
00:58:58,325 --> 00:59:02,367
you walk with me

867
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:08,408
and we're happy about the obvious things.

868
00:59:08,533 --> 00:59:15,783
I hope time would just stop now at this moment.

869
00:59:17,783 --> 00:59:20,075
I discover new things about myself as I get to know you.

870
00:59:20,242 --> 00:59:22,950
You're my one and only, a lucky 4-leaf clover.

871
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,492
Thank you. I love that you're beside me.

872
00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:28,033
We're perfect the more I look at us, I love it.

873
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:30,533
I dream of these butterflies last forever.

874
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:33,200
I'm not curious as to see how much time has passed.

875
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,700
A sweet kiss after embracing me warmly.

876
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:40,617
You look me in the eye

877
00:59:41,033 --> 00:59:45,492
and hold my hands naturally

878
00:59:46,158 --> 00:59:51,783
even if I don't tell you where we're going

879
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:55,825
you walk with me.

880
00:59:56,325 --> 01:00:01,950
We're happy about the obvious things

881
01:00:02,075 --> 01:00:10,158
This moment, you and I, just like this

882
01:00:13,575 --> 01:00:16,325
Hold each other's hands.

883
01:00:16,908 --> 01:00:22,450
Even if I don't tell you where we're going

884
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:26,492
you walk with me.

885
01:00:26,992 --> 01:00:32,450
We're happy about the obvious things.

886
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:40,367
I hope time would stop right this moment

887
01:00:44,158 --> 01:00:46,325
I see you.

888
01:00:46,825 --> 01:00:49,117
You're getting closer.

889
01:00:54,492 --> 01:00:56,533
I see you.

890
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,408
Bernard Park's perfect Spring song.

891
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:09,075
Thank you so much for that.

892
01:01:09,492 --> 01:01:13,367
YG's Yang Hyun-Suk. What did you think about the stage?

893
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:16,117
I have many complaints.

894
01:01:16,117 --> 01:01:17,117
Why?

895
01:01:17,575 --> 01:01:21,325
Bernard Park came to sing today on stage

896
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:24,950
and in next week's finals stage Park Jin-young makes his comeback.

897
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,325
Right yes.

898
01:01:26,325 --> 01:01:31,117
And Antenna Music's Sam Kim is coming out next week too right?

899
01:01:31,658 --> 01:01:34,658
I don't understand why you're not letting any YG singers on stage.

900
01:01:34,658 --> 01:01:38,033
I saw Lee Hi's face very briefly. Where are you Hi?

901
01:01:39,033 --> 01:01:41,533
Lee Hi is in the audience yes.

902
01:01:41,783 --> 01:01:44,325
Yeah I didn't know she was here either. I'm kidding.

903
01:01:45,325 --> 01:01:49,325
Bernard Park and Sam Kim were both guys we had many expectations for.

904
01:01:49,742 --> 01:01:53,033
I think viewers who love K-pop star would've very much looked forward to it.

905
01:01:53,075 --> 01:01:57,575
I think people can look forward to Park Jin-young's stage next week too.

906
01:01:57,617 --> 01:02:02,742
We'll look forward to YG's comeback as well.

907
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:06,742
Soon the time of fate will arrive.

908
01:02:06,783 --> 01:02:08,992
We'll announce who passes and who will be eliminated.

909
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:12,367
Take a look at TOP 4's highlight clips and

910
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:16,033
we'll wait for your texts for 1 more minute.

911
01:02:16,117 --> 01:02:22,283
Who will pass and who will be eliminated? Stay with us until the end.

912
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:24,117
Let's look at the highlights.

913
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:26,367
K-pop star!

914
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:43,492
[1 Lee Si-eun]

915
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:56,783
[2 Lee Soo-Jung]

916
01:02:57,325 --> 01:03:11,658
[3 Ahn Ye-eun]

917
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:26,825
[4 Mazinger S]

918
01:03:33,033 --> 01:03:36,700
[End of text votes]

919
01:03:36,908 --> 01:03:40,783
The winner of K-pop star season 5 will receive a total of $3,000,000.

920
01:03:42,117 --> 01:03:47,367
And they will also be awarded with a global midsized car.

921
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:02,992
[Incheon Nam-dong center live]

922
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:08,242
This is an important moment. Survival audition K-pop star season 5.

923
01:04:08,325 --> 01:04:12,325
We only have left the announcement of who will continue onto the final round.

924
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:17,367
As a result of 60% of the judges' scores and 40% of the text votes,

925
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:23,533
only 2 of the 4 teams standing here will be on the next week's final stages.

926
01:04:24,033 --> 01:04:26,908
I think Yang Hyun-Suk in the judges seats is holding an envelope.

927
01:04:26,908 --> 01:04:29,992
And I just received an envelope as well.

928
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:37,033
The 2 envelopes have inside them names of people who will continue onto the finals.

929
01:04:37,158 --> 01:04:39,825
Because we haven't opened it yet we do not know.

930
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:44,617
We'll have to hear how the TOP 4 are feeling right now.

931
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:46,950
Si-eun. How are you feeling?

932
01:04:48,242 --> 01:04:50,908
Everyone did so well today

933
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:54,033
but I can't really tell who's going to be eliminated.

934
01:04:54,033 --> 01:04:55,033
I see.

935
01:04:55,158 --> 01:05:00,533
Your feedback weren't all that great today regarding your stage. What do you think?

936
01:05:00,617 --> 01:05:01,825
Are you disappointed? Or-

937
01:05:02,742 --> 01:05:07,742
I feel like I didn't show everything I had so I am a little bit but it's okay.

938
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:08,742
Okay.

939
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:10,242
Soo-Jung?

940
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:11,825
How do you feel right now?

941
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:16,283
Everyone did so well so I'm curious as to how it's going to turn out.

942
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,283
I see.

943
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:20,617
Do you think your name will be called? Or not?

944
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:21,908
What are you predicting?

945
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:22,908
I don't know.

946
01:05:22,908 --> 01:05:23,908
You don't?

947
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:24,783
I see.

948
01:05:24,783 --> 01:05:25,742
Ye-eun?

949
01:05:25,742 --> 01:05:26,742
Yes.

950
01:05:28,283 --> 01:05:31,825
What do you think? Do you think you'll make it to the next round? Or

951
01:05:32,242 --> 01:05:33,283
do you think you'll get eliminated?

952
01:05:33,283 --> 01:05:34,992
I'm wondering that myself.

953
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,450
I asked you because I was wondering.

954
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:37,533
I don't really know.

955
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:38,533
You don't?

956
01:05:38,575 --> 01:05:40,075
I see. How do you feel right now?

957
01:05:40,075 --> 01:05:41,408
Do you feel good? Or-

958
01:05:41,658 --> 01:05:45,492
I think I did everything without regrets so-

959
01:05:45,492 --> 01:05:46,700
You don't have regrets about your stages.

960
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,908
Okay.

961
01:05:47,992 --> 01:05:48,992
Mazinger S?

962
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,533
How do you feel?

963
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:54,408
It's sad to think this might be our last but we have no regrets.

964
01:05:55,033 --> 01:05:55,908
I see.

965
01:05:55,908 --> 01:05:57,242
How about Joyce Lee?

966
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,825
Yes. How do you feel?

967
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:04,033
I want to know the results but I'm proud that we worked hard.

968
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:05,450
I see.

969
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:10,075
I think everyone's calmly waiting for the results now.

970
01:06:10,158 --> 01:06:11,533
Who,

971
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:12,908
out of these 4 teams,

972
01:06:13,242 --> 01:06:14,617
everyone has the ability to win,

973
01:06:14,617 --> 01:06:20,325
will be the 2 teams to go onto next week's live stages.

974
01:06:20,533 --> 01:06:22,075
Mr. Yang will you announce it?

975
01:06:22,075 --> 01:06:25,325
Please announce the first team to continue on.

976
01:06:25,658 --> 01:06:27,575
[Who will be the first to go on to the final round?]

977
01:06:27,575 --> 01:06:32,700
Unfortunately the feedback were overall not very positive today

978
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,533
and just by looking at the judges' scores

979
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,825
the scores do not differ by much.

980
01:06:38,075 --> 01:06:41,825
Everyone differs by 4-5 points.

981
01:06:42,325 --> 01:06:43,992
It means that it was a close competition.

982
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:47,283
The text votes came in very close as well.

983
01:06:47,825 --> 01:06:49,325
Okay. Mr. Yang Hyun-Suk!

984
01:06:49,617 --> 01:06:56,242
Who is the 1st team to continue onto the next week's live final round?

985
01:06:57,617 --> 01:07:02,117
A contestant I really love is going onto the final round first.

986
01:07:05,742 --> 01:07:09,283
The first team to continue onto the final round is

987
01:07:10,908 --> 01:07:12,242
I'm getting nervous.

988
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,283
I'm getting anxious.

989
01:07:14,533 --> 01:07:17,033
The judges' scores were not far apart.

990
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,283
For everyone.

991
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:20,450
I'll announce it.

992
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:24,283
Lee Soo-Jung.

993
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:25,408
Congratulations!

994
01:07:26,783 --> 01:07:29,408
Soo-Jung please come up to the platform.

995
01:07:32,992 --> 01:07:40,075
She interpreted Park Jin-young's "That house you live in" really well in her own way.

996
01:07:41,367 --> 01:07:45,783
Soo-Jung is on the final platform first.

997
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:47,325
Now the remaining 3 teams.

998
01:07:47,325 --> 01:07:53,200
Only 1 out of these 3 teams will be on the final rounds next week.

999
01:07:53,742 --> 01:07:57,950
I will now open this envelope that I am holding.

1000
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:05,492
Who had the second largest number of votes in combination of both scores?

1001
01:08:05,575 --> 01:08:22,783
[Who will be the last team to join the final round? And who will be eliminated?]

1002
01:08:22,783 --> 01:08:24,283
I will announce it now.

1003
01:08:25,658 --> 01:08:29,283
Lee Si-eun, Ahn Ye-eun, and Mazinger S.

1004
01:08:29,908 --> 01:08:31,700
Whoever I announce

1005
01:08:32,117 --> 01:08:33,367
no one will object.

1006
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:34,992
Everyone did well today.

1007
01:08:34,992 --> 01:08:37,492
But from the results

1008
01:08:38,117 --> 01:08:43,825
this person, this team will be continuing onto next week's live stage.

1009
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:47,242
Lee Si-eun with the perfect high notes,

1010
01:08:47,283 --> 01:08:52,033
Ahn Ye-eun who surprises us every week with her self-written songs each week,

1011
01:08:52,075 --> 01:09:01,117
and Mazinger S with the best harmony and performance.

1012
01:09:01,492 --> 01:09:02,908
Out of these 3 teams,

1013
01:09:03,117 --> 01:09:07,742
this team is going to continue onto next week's live stage.

1014
01:09:08,408 --> 01:09:09,533
I'll announce it!

1015
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,700
The team

1016
01:09:12,242 --> 01:09:13,992
who will be on the TOP 2 of K-pop star

1017
01:09:13,992 --> 01:09:16,242
the last team to continue on is!

1018
01:09:20,742 --> 01:09:22,158
Ahn Ye-eun!

1019
01:09:25,283 --> 01:09:26,617
Congratulations.

1020
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,450
Soo-Jung you can come out.

1021
01:09:31,783 --> 01:09:33,283
Yes so..

1022
01:09:35,908 --> 01:09:39,367
She overcame the pressure to have to come up with a new song every week

1023
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:42,242
and ended up in the TOP 2.

1024
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,575
Okay the-

1025
01:09:47,325 --> 01:09:49,950
Ye-eun. How do you feel right now?

1026
01:09:50,325 --> 01:09:55,783
I don't know if I deserve this.

1027
01:09:56,408 --> 01:10:02,575
But because I'm presented with it, I'll prepare my best. Thank you.

1028
01:10:02,617 --> 01:10:05,742
Will your next week's final stage be your own song as well?

1029
01:10:05,825 --> 01:10:06,700
I think so.

1030
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,783
She says she thinks so.

1031
01:10:09,992 --> 01:10:13,783
Regrettably Lee Si-eun and Mazinger S will leave K-pop star today.

1032
01:10:13,783 --> 01:10:14,783
First, Si-eun.

1033
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:16,908
How do you feel right now?

1034
01:10:17,117 --> 01:10:20,492
I think I learned a lot having gone through this.

1035
01:10:20,492 --> 01:10:24,908
I thank the 3 judges for giving me such good advice

1036
01:10:25,075 --> 01:10:33,617
I thank the staff who worked so hard, my fans, family and friends who encouraged me.

1037
01:10:33,617 --> 01:10:37,575
I'll work hard and grow more from now. Thank you.

1038
01:10:37,658 --> 01:10:38,658
Thank you.

1039
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:42,117
There's no question that Si-eun has talent.

1040
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:43,658
Mr. Park why don't you tell her something.

1041
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:44,658
Yes.

1042
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:47,742
You two had a mentor-mentee relationship.

1043
01:10:48,033 --> 01:10:49,033
I can't

1044
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:53,158
ever forget Si-eun's first song "I will sing."

1045
01:10:54,242 --> 01:10:57,158
Those, those lyrics back then

1046
01:10:57,408 --> 01:11:01,617
felt like you were just pouring what's in your heart right into the song.

1047
01:11:02,075 --> 01:11:05,408
If you can just find that again I think you'll become an excellent singer.

1048
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:08,408
That performance will linger with me for a long time.

1049
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:09,617
Thank you. You worked hard.

1050
01:11:09,617 --> 01:11:11,075
Okay.

1051
01:11:11,783 --> 01:11:14,992
Please thank Park Jin-young with another awesome stage in the future.

Mazinger S. A word?

1053
01:11:17,283 --> 01:11:23,908
I was thankful that each of us from different countries were able to come together.

1054
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:27,700
I thank our parents for giving birth to us beautifully.

1055
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:32,117
Thank you judges for working so hard.

1056
01:11:33,533 --> 01:11:38,908
I thought it was impossible for us to come all the way to TOP 4 so

1057
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:41,575
I really thank God.

1058
01:11:41,617 --> 01:11:42,617
Thank you.

1059
01:11:44,492 --> 01:11:50,450
Coming to K-pop star, this was really a miracle, making it to TOP 4.

1060
01:11:50,617 --> 01:11:54,325

1062
01:11:57,658 --> 01:12:01,658
So K-pop star season 5 ended up with two finalists

01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:04,925
