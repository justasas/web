2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,800
But based on the rule in this bay, there has never been a woman who can inherit the family business.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,300
Since you are not able to inherit your family business,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,510
automatically, you can't manage this hot springs inn.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
But I want to be a good person and do a good deed in helping you manage it.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,200
That's why, I also must have an official title.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,800
Isn't that so?

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,200
Around here,

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,000
who doesn't know that I'm sincere towards you?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,360
Then rather than looking for another date, why don't we just set it to today?

11
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,200
Today, just officially be my wife.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,220
How about it?

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,000
This way, as one family, we don't need to be against each other.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,900
Pfft! A toad wanting to eat swan meat!

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,700
Xiao Mei, take Xiao Cai away first.

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll deal with this rascal.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,600
I'll let you taste my brush!

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
Who do you think you are?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,800
You won't behave if I don't teach you a lesson.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,600
Then I'll let you pay for both old and new grudges today then.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Buddies, attack!

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,300
Yes!

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,820
Drag him away!

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,700
Don't let me see him again!

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,670
- Get up.<br>- Stop! Stop!

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,600
Stop! Get lost!

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,200
- Yuan Shuai.<br>- What? So does that mean you agree?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
Xiao Cai, don't mind me.

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,400
Hurry and go.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,800
Xiao Dao, if I marry you, you'll give up already. Is that it?

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,140
Right.

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,700
So many years have passed.

33
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,100
In this bay, other than me, who else will be willing to marry you?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
Come, Yuan Shuai.

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,300
Xiao Dao, then let me tell you.

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,600
All the people here, please be my witness.

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,000
He, Yuan Shuai, is my fiancé.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,800
We have already privately pledged to be married to each other. Soon we'll have a marriage ceremony.

39
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,000
From now on, I will be his person.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,400
Do you have any question?

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Zhou Xiao Cai, do you think that just randomly grabbing a person, you'd be pledged to be married?

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,450
Do you think I am a three-year-old child?

43
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,800
Who are you fooling?

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,400
Can someone just randomly speak about one's marriage?

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,000
After all, our Zhou family also is a respectable family.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,200
No matter in how much dire straits we end up, we still won't need a rascal like you to prop up our reputation.

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiao Dao, look well.

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,200
Yuan Shuai, let me ask you.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,300
Are you willing to marry me, Zhou Xiao Cai, as your wife?

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,370
Answer.

51
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,990
I am willing.

52
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,490
Fine, Zhou Xiao Cai. You just have to do this, is that it?

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,000
Then don't blame me for not giving you any retreat path.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,300
Xiao Dao, listen well.

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,500
He, Yuan Shuai, is my fiancé.

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
Zhou Xiao Cai...

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Fine. I even thought you loved your Older Bro Ying Jun so much.

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
Looks like, you are only like this.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,700
Everyone, just disperse.

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,800
By that time, we will let everyone attend the wedding.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,400
We surely will entertain you all well.

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,500
Fine. You win for today.

63
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,880
- Move out!<br>- Get lost!

64
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,700
Move aside! Move aside!

65
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,480
Xiao Cai, don't worry.

66
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,200
- Older sis...<br>- I surely will treat you well for the rest of my life.

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,800
- you are not planning to...<br>- No matter if the world ends,

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
I will still be loyal to you.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,200
Older Sis, I never thought that you were this kind of person.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,000
When you kill, you attack so fast that the enemy is caught unprepared. Just publicly announcing your fiancé.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You tell me. If you're that good, why didn't you just say that Xiao Dao was you fiancé?

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Bullying a chef who has amnesia. Do you think it's fun?

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,320
I also was just forced to do it.

74
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,200
You also saw that situation earlier.

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,000
If it was you, you also would do the same.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
If I'd known earlier...

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,690
Hey, Little Sister, stop saying cynical remarks.

78
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,800
Hurry and help me think of an idea.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
If we are not able to think of an idea by today, I'll kick Yuan Shuai out.

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,200
Older Sis, is everything really clear to you?

81
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,000
Then kick him out. He isn't my fiancé anyway.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,930
Based on what?

83
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,200
We worked hard to earn money outside and we will just give it to you?

84
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,100
First, you privately pocketing the reward has violated a major law of the underground city.

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,000
Second, this money isn't going to me.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,200
When you all were still training in the assassin's camp,

87
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,600
didn't you eat and use the best ones?

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,900
When you have become true assassins, that is when you repay the underground city.

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,600
Can't we even use this money to buy medicine for our sick father?

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,450
Your father is sick?

91
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,400
Does your father know about this?

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,200
If he knew about it, would he approve of your doing?

93
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
My father was the one who raised me.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,490
Now that I have attained achievements,

95
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,200
can't I even repay him?

96
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I am not tasked to reply to such questions.

97
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,700
- You decide by yourself.<br>- You...

98
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
<i>This girl looks quite outstanding.</i>

99
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,000
<i>I'm guessing that she must be the leader here.</i>

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,900
<i>Maybe I can even get some clues from her.</i>

101
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,800
Do you dare steal my money?

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,400
When have I tried stealing your money?

103
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
What is this?

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Your money bag. What else can it be?

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,800
- He is an outsider!<br>- Hey...

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,010
Calm down. Calm down.

107
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,600
I only just stole a money bag. Do you guys have to be like this?

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,200
Stop!

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,200
A few of you take him up here.

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
As for the rest, just disperse.

111
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

112
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Go. I'm returning this to you.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Older Sis. Older Sis!

114
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,160
What is it?

115
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,400
Now that our business is doing well,

116
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,300
tell me, what should we do?

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,800
What 'what should we do'?

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Yuan Shuai.

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
What really do you want to say?

120
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,300
Yuan Shuai is currently our shop's main profit source.

121
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,730
Our shop's business is doing so great now all thanks to him.

122
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
You are not telling me to betray Older Bro Ying Jun, right?

123
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,330
Older Sis, what are you thinking?

124
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,200
I didn't mean it that way.

125
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,100
What I mean is Yuan Shuai will never keep being a chef here.

126
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,960
He just hasn't regained his memories yet for now.

127
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,700
Once he does, he surely will hate us.

128
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,700
Even if he doesn't, he most likely won't keep staying here to work for us.

129
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,200
I also thought about that problem.

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,200
But right now, we don't have a better way.

131
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,250
Older Sis, you have studied more than me.

132
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,000
Think of a way.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,700
The books have everything but it never taught me how to make a person stay.

134
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,780
Based on my observations these past days,

135
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,170
I noticed that our customers here are not really coming for the hot springs,

136
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,000
nor the little yellow fish set meal.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
Then what is their purpose?

138
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,200
Could it be that they are coming here because of us?

139
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Of course not.

140
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,400
It's the sauce ingredient.

141
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500
Sauce ingredient?

142
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,770
Right now, there are already a lot of customers asking me

143
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,140
if we can sell the sauce separately.

144
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,580
Do you know what this means?

145
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,500
This means that the sauce is our store's main selling point.

146
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,180
Recently, I have been helping him as his assistant.

147
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,600
I have been indirectly asking him about it.

148
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,900
He said that this is a family secret recipe. He cannot tell it to outsiders.

149
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,200
If the sauce is our shop's main selling point,

150
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
then I must think of a way to get it.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,600
I indeed want to tell you about this matter.

152
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,800
We will be unable to let him stay but we must keep the sauce.

153
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,350
Am I being unkind for thinking that way?

154
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,780
Have you forgotten those words that you said before?

155
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,600
All hard work that one does just to protect oneself

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,800
is worthy to be understood.

157
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,600
Xiao Mei, it's good that you are here.

158
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,200
Just good. Just good. I have something to ask you.

159
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,750
What?

160
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,990
Did you feel that after Xiao Cai proposed marriage to me,

161
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,960
she seems to be avoiding me these past days.

162
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,390
You can't blame my older sis about that!

163
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
No. No. I am not blaming her.

164
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,200
But you also know that my brain isn't working that well now.

165
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,000
Did I do anything wrong that had angered her?

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And also I am a little suspicious...

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,100
Suspicious of what?

168
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,000
Suspicious that she is just using me.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,600
No. How could my older sis use you?

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
Don't you know how you wooed her before?

171
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,600
Don't you know that you two were already in talks of marriage before?

172
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,500
Don't you know how sincere older sis is towards you?

173
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,200
I really don't remember all these that you are saying.

174
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,700
Can you tell them to me?

175
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,100
<i>Oh, no. Isn't he asking me to lie?</i>

176
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,200
<i>Older Bro Ying Jun, so sorry.</i>

177
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,400
<i>I can only transfer what happened to you to him.</i>

178
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,900
Actually, you know older sister better than she knows herself.

179
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Can you say it more clearly?

180
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,200
You even know that she only drinks lukewarm water.

181
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,300
There are a lot of things that you can make just right for her.

182
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,600
You know that she can't drink wine but loves to join in the fun.

183
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,700
That's why, you made grape wine desserts to satisfy her curiosity.

184
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,400
Actually, the most important point among everything

185
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,000
is that in the past, you will immediately appear as long as older sister needs you.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,400
You never disappointed her.

187
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,200
So I was that kind of person before.

188
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,500
Xiao Mei, I will remember everything that you have said.

189
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,440
For Xiao Cai, I must work harder to be a better person.

190
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,000
Xiao Mei,

191
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,050
your story making abilities are way better than mine.

192
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,260
Not really. Not really.

193
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,200
You made the story of Older Bro Ying Jun as Yuan Shuai's.

194
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,970
Don't think I don't know.

195
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,450
Then Older Sister, what else can I do?

196
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,630
Do you want me to tell him that we lied to him?

197
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,740
What? Older Sister, you're feeling sorry for him now?

198
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,930
What are you saying?

199
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,780
I just feel that by doing that, we are wronging Older Bro Ying Jun.

200
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,180
Older Bro Ying Jun has already been–

201
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,860
He hasn't come back for so long already.

202
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,670
He doesn't know our situation, either.

203
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,330
Once we get the sauce recipe,

204
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,360
even if he regains his memories and leaves,

205
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,000
our days won't also be that hard. Isn't that so?

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,400
Do we still have any other way out now?

207
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,010
Could it be...

208
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,340
that I really have to marry Yuan Shuai?

209
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,070
Anyway, if you keep being cold to him like this,

210
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,000
even a stupid person can see that something is wrong.

211
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,400
Leader Lan Ling, we already brought the person.

212
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,360
Leave then.

213
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,460
But... this brat tried stealing my reward.

214
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,380
You're so talkative.

215
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,420
- Just a measly thief. Leave.<br>- Yes.

216
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,530
Hurry and leave.

217
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,320
Did you come from outside?

218
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,620
Right. You noticed it.

219
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,460
You are quite good.

220
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,730
I don't really have some bad intentions in coming here to your place.

221
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,600
I just want to ask you to help me find a person.

222
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,580
Find a person?

223
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,980
Do you know what this place is?

224
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,940
Coming here to find a person?

225
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,000
I know.

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,390
This is the Middle Point, the scariest place in the whole Yongzhou Underground City.

227
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,350
All assassins are here.

228
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,380
But looking how kind you are,

229
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,700
you surely will help me.

230
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,670
Her name is Zi Su.

231
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,590
Have you heard of her?

232
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,690
If you are just looking for someone,

233
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,020
why did you steal the assassin's reward?

234
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,770
Wow! Killing one person amounts to so much money?!

235
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,700
Oh, so sorry. What were you saying earlier?

236
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,270
I asked you why you stole the assassin's reward money when you were just looking for a person.

237
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,140
Because... I want to see you.

238
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,370
- See me?<br>- That's right.

239
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,660
I saw how mighty you were earlier outside.

240
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,860
You must be the leader here at the Middle Point, right?

241
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,170
I think that you surely can help me.

242
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,970
What made you think that I will help you?

243
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,320
Because...

244
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,790
Look. I am so handsome, so young, and I–

245
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,630
I'm not that handsome–

246
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,260
Smooth-talker... pestering unreasonably!

247
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,860
That...

248
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,860
Say it. What really is your purpose in coming here?

249
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,950
I already told you. I am here to look for a friend.

250
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,070
Her name is Zi Su.

251
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,240
Have you heard of her or not?

252
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,210
Hey.

253
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,200
Do you people here in underground city never really see the sun?

254
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,160
If you never saw the sun, then you never saw a sunflower.

255
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,800
If you never saw a sunflower, then you never eaten sunflower seeds.

256
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,130
Not being able to eat sunflower seeds at all is really so pitiful.

257
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,800
- You!<br>- What you?

258
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,860
Going. Goodbye.

259
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,100
Stop!

260
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,340
Just leaving like that?

261
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,460
Isn't that making it too easy for you?

262
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,850
Let me tell you. If you don't want to help, then don't.

263
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,050
You shouldn't be like this.

264
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,840
Don't do things too excessive so it won't be awkward if we meet again.

265
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,400
Do you understand?

266
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,270
How about this? You agree with my one condition.

267
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,860
I won't go after your misdeeds

268
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,700
and will even allow you to temporarily stay here in my place.

269
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,890
How about it?

270
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,760
What condition?

271
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,340
I want you to tell me stories from the outside world whenever I'm free.

272
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,350
This... okay. Okay.

273
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,180
If we want to save this island,

274
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,290
then we must hand over one person as the scapegoat.

275
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,570
Do you think that this plan will work?

276
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,840
We only have this plan at this time.

277
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,670
We can only try.

278
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,160
Who should we hand to them?

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,380
Whoever stole the ship, we give him up.

280
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,630
Cheng Ming Pan?

281
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,480
Right.

282
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,700
The navy isn't an easy opponent.

283
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,480
They are unlikely to let things go if we just give them some random person.

284
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,000
I already told you before

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,950
that if we want this place to last long, we must stop our illegal dealings and start anew.

286
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,320
As long as this place continues to be a pirate bay, it will never be able to escape danger.

287
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,650
I know. Right now, let's first get past this difficulty.

288
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,880
But Cheng Ming Pan's strength is also something that cannot be belittled.

289
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,840
So...

290
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,920
how can we be able to hand him over to the government?

291
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,220
If we add our current strengths, we still won't be able to defeat him.

292
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,560
That's right.

293
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,290
Moreover, his sailors are well-trained for battles.

294
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,860
<i>Master! Master!</i>

295
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,630
Master, Da Fu is here.

296
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,480
Okay. You can leave now.

297
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,030
Yes.

298
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,700
Why did you come here?

299
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,910
Of course, I'm here to help you.

300
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,760
Let us then get straight to the point.

301
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,490
What you need is a pirate leader that can serve as the scapegoat,

302
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,100
while I want a captain position.

303
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,640
Just right, we can just get what we each want.

304
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,520
For Cheng Ming Pan to be able to be in his status now, there must be a reason.

305
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,270
Moreover, he has so many men under him, all powerful and well-trained.

306
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,690
I do want to hear your idea.

307
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,990
As long as he is not the captain, with just his individual strength,

308
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,700
he is at most like a grasshopper after autumn.

309
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,170
It would be easier to just kill him than not letting him be the captain.

310
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,900
Not really.

311
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,940
As the second in command of the ship,

312
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,260
I know very well how the sailors are thinking.

313
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,300
Our brothers have all been unsatisfied with him for a long time already.

314
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,950
It's just that no one is talking.

315
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,330
Could it be that you want to oust him?

316
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:20,900
That's right. Our ship has it's own rules.

317
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,300
The captain is someone that all of us chose.

318
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,540
Right now, the men that I can guarantee haven't reached a half of our crew.

319
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,810
I still need 20 votes.

320
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,830
How is it, you two?

321
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,020
Are you interested?

322
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,270
Just leave the rest to us.

323
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:59,030
KoreanDramaX.co

324
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,440
<i>You were non-benevolent so don't blame me for being disloyal!</i>

325
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,080
118, I already guessed that you would come back to cause trouble.

326
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,860
For the sake of your old father,

327
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,600
if you leave now, I can treat it as if nothing happened.

328
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,770
Lan Ling, since I already came, I never thought of going back.

329
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,150
Since you dared to humiliate me publicly today,

330
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,130
I must make you pay!

331
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,590
Stop saying nonsense and making false counter charges.

332
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,480
It was you who broke the rules first.

333
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,600
If I don't punish you, how am I going to make the others obey?

334
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,140
Stop your nonsense! Watch my move!

335
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,220
Never thought after training in martial arts,

336
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,180
you actually used it against your own kind.

337
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,670
I am not able to defeat you. I am willing to accept punishment.

338
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,560
Who are you?!

339
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,360
Stop!

340
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,550
Don't run!

341
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,330
Before you die, I'll let you see the sun once.

342
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,340
That's already worth it.

343
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,240
You crazy person!

344
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,560
Lan Ling.

345
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,470
Zhan Xiong Fei.

346
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,610
Let's go.

347
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,090
Lan Ling, let's go.

348
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,210
Zhan Xiong Fei!

349
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,070
Lan Ling, go back to the underground city!

350
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,300
Where is the cave entrance?

351
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,230
I can't see it.

352
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,430
Just keep walking left!

353
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,060
Do you think... this person can be trusted?

354
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,770
I can see greed in him.

355
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,940
When a person's greed swells, it is the scariest.

356
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,660
As long as something threatens the Pirate Bay,

357
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,940
no one can be totally safe.

358
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,980
Why are you so attached to this place?

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,760
Because this island...

360
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,380
is my home.

361
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,920
If you tell that to other people, maybe they will believe you.

362
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,240
Then just believe what you want.

363
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,730
Ming Zhen, I know

364
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,440
that you have been protecting this place.

365
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,550
Surviving on this island where most people are men

366
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,770
and even swearing with your life to protect it,

367
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,860
you must have your reasons.

368
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,900
- I won't ask but you also can't--<br>- Don't continue saying it anymore.

369
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,410
Fine.

370
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,890
I just want to tell you.

371
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,600
I will forever help you guard the Pirate Bay.

372
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,300
Tell me.

373
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,930
How are we going to get the remaining votes?

374
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,570
Don't worry.

375
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,740
I already asked my men to check on it.

376
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,580
<i>Master.</i>

377
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,190
Master, I have already investigated it.

378
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,150
How was it? Hurry and say.

379
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,970
There are total of 73 people on the ship.

380
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,270
Thirty-plus people are Cheng Ming Pan's loyal supporters.

381
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,690
The remaining ones which we can convince can be divided into three groups.

382
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,900
As long as we can get them, we can win.

383
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,460
Please continue.

384
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,700
One of the three group's leader is someone who likes to drink a lot.

385
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,730
I really have to thank you this time.

386
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,880
You really were so courageous.

387
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,590
If not because of you, I might have–

388
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,730
Being a real man,

389
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,120
it's unreasonable for me to just look at my friend in danger

390
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,620
and not do anything.

391
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,870
But I still have to thank you.

392
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,560
Enough already. No need.

393
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,620
Then... continue telling me stories from outside.

394
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,540
Ah... how about let's skip today?

395
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,680
I am going to find Zi Su.

396
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,940
I'll just tell it to you when I return.

397
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,410
But the underground city is so big.

398
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,410
Do you know where to find her?

399
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,910
Even if the chance is too small, I still will do my best.

400
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,090
This Ms. Zi Su is really lucky to have a friend like you.

401
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,310
I'm going then.

402
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,810
That... I'll cook you some delicious food when you return.

403
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,380
Okay.

404
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,560
Come. One more.

405
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,120
Come.

406
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,220
Mister Feng, I heard that you don't drink.

407
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,730
Right. I don't.

408
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,400
On this island, you can count with one hand the people who don't drink.

409
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,890
But as the old saying goes, 'One pot of wine, one group of friends,

410
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,410
even the gods are envious'.

411
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,340
Come.

412
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,920
Mister Feng, listening to what you said, this wine isn't for free, right?

413
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,350
As long as we are able to discuss things well,

414
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:17,590
I guarantee you that you'll have never-ending good wine.

415
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,010
Just for a mouthful of wine, I will never do things that will endanger my life.

416
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,400
Don't worry. I will surely not let you be killed.

417
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,810
I won't do things that will offend my buddies, either.

418
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,030
Not only will you not offend your buddies,

419
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,810
it can even make you and your buddies have a good life.

420
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:36,780
Mister Feng, with you saying it like that, I am already confused.

421
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,790
What do you mean?

422
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,150
Come.

423
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,100
I want to ask you, what is your reason for being a pirate?

424
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,270
Trying to earn some food to eat.

425
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,320
Being exposed to the wind and sun all day,

426
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,750
always risking your life, who would want to do such a job?

427
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,460
But from what I can see, you all right now aren't that rich.

428
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,780
What do you mean?

429
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,370
For those products that you recently got, how much did each of you get?

430
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,950
Mister Feng, this is a private matter within our ship.

431
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,840
It doesn't really concern you, right?

432
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,930
Although it doesn't have much concern with me,

433
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,790
you still have to think about it well for your wine and your buddies, right?

434
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,000
I know. You guys are looking forward for your payment for three months already.

435
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,450
But how much have you received?

436
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,730
What really do you want to say?

437
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,220
Don't you want to change to a captain that can lead you all to success?

438
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,670
I won't do such a thing.

439
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,680
I know what you are thinking.

440
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,110
Whoever extends their hand first might be able to be the first one to get it.

441
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,810
Actually, it's very easy. I just need you all to raise your hands.

442
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
- Us?<br>- Right.

443
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,940
You and your group of buddies.

444
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,460
They might not listen to me.

445
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,790
But they will surely listen to this.

446
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,850
That one earlier is for your hard work.

447
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,780
This one is for the wine money for your buddies.

448
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,480
Come, let's drink!

449
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,170
Cheers!

450
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,580
You can choose not to believe me.

451
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,080
Let me ask you one question.

452
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,980
If this time the capital investigates this matter,

453
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,920
will the strength of just your ship

454
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,440
be able to go against them?

455
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,180
I understand what you mean.

456
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,070
Aren't you just asking me to betray?

457
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,450
Then let me ask you a question, too.

458
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,260
Do you think I am such a kind of person?

459
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,210
I am thinking for your sake.

460
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,890
I can totally tell the capital that

461
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,750
the ship was robbed by you guys.

462
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,970
Then why didn't you do that?

463
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,310
You guys and pirate bay are interdependent.

464
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,300
If you're down, the bay will be in danger.

465
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,240
I don't understand what you mean.

466
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,750
What I mean is...

467
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,660
I don't want more people to suffer just because of his decision.

468
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,670
Then let me tell you, too,

469
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,460
that every decision he makes is for our sake.

470
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,180
Even if you will die, are you still willing?

471
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,110
With him around, we won't die.

472
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,630
Have you all thought about the consequences of doing this?

473
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,560
No need for you to worry about that.

474
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,760
I know your status here including your relations with the captain.

475
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,550
I can treat that nothing happened today.

476
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,460
Wait.

477
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,210
If you still don't want to completely be an enemy of our captain,

478
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,010
then don't say anything anymore.

479
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,610
If it was just for myself,

480
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,170
I can choose not to say it.

481
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:09,860
But...

482
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,500
Based on your actions,

483
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,480
it seems that you won't stop until this matter is done then.

484
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,920
I think you already know very well my stand on this matter.

485
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,390
I am urging you to stop for the last time.

486
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,920
Or else, I can't guarantee that I won't tell captain about it.

487
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,040
Are you sure that is what you are going to do?

488
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,290
Unless you kill me now.

489
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,220
What? You killed him?

490
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,280
Right.

491
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,520
At this time, how could you...

492
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,810
In that situation that time, killing him was the best choice.

493
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,290
If things have progressed to this level,

494
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,680
then we don't have much time left.

495
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,470
Once Cheng Ming Pan discovers it,

496
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,120
we will then attract disaster to ourselves.

497
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,140
Are there anybody else that we can draw to our side?

498
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,170
We can only try.

499
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,810
The hardest one to deal with is someone without any desires or wishes.

500
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,250
I'll go with you.

501
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,990
You illness isn't very serious.

502
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,010
- Good.<br>- As long as you take your medicines on time,

503
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,830
within three days, you'll totally be cured.

504
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,270
Thank you, miracle doctor.

505
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,760
- Please be careful on your way home.<br>- Okay.

506
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,520
- Let's go.<br>- Let's go.

507
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,890
After three days, return here again.

508
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,610
Okay. Okay.

509
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,790
Teacher!

510
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,400
Qian Zhen?

511
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,570
I was not filial.

512
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,760
Hurry and get up. Quickly get up.

513
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,140
You finally returned.

514
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,280
On my way here,

515
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,560
all the corners here are memories.

516
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,050
It's good that you are back. It's good that you're back.

517
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,930
<i>Congratulations, 929.</i>

518
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,970
<i>The Netherworld Assassin Camp Leader and I </i>

519
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,120
<i>have decided to promote you to be the assassin team leader.</i>

520
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,060
<i>Thank you, City Leader, for promoting me.</i>

521
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,230
<i>In the Assassin Camp, there are only five team leaders.</i>

522
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,890
<i>The next camp leader will also come from you five.</i>

523
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,080
<i>I personally support you for that position.</i>

524
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,780
<i>I will surely not disappoint city leader.</i>

525
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:14,410
<i>The netherworld assassins kill for a lifetime and look cold and heartless,</i>

526
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,910
<i>but you all are the heroes of the underground city.</i>

527
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,910
<i>You all use your life and fresh blood</i>

528
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,220
<i>to guard the peace and happiness of the citizens of the underground city.</i>

529
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,650
<i>Forever do not forget your duty.</i>

530
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,220
<i>Yes. I will forever remember it.</i>

531
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,460
<i>Okay.</i>

532
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,710
<i>Go to the middle person to receive your first mission.</i>

533
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,520
<i>Yes.</i>

534
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,490
<i>Never thought that at a young age, you would become an assassin team leader.</i>

535
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,140
<i>Take this.</i>

536
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,020
<i>[Duan Residence: Duan's Family of Five.]</i>

537
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,520
<i>The first mission I got was to kill all five people in the Duan family.</i>

538
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,230
<i>Not even letting an infant live.</i>

539
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,100
<i>For a newbie like me, how could I bear to do it.</i>

540
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,520
<i>Hence...</i>

541
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,690
<i>City Leader!</i>

542
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,410
<i>This is the first time that such a thing happened in our Netherworld Assassin Camp.</i>

543
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,380
<i>He didn't only affect the reputation of the assassin camp,</i>

544
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,570
<i>but he also affected the safety of our Yongzhou Underground City.</i>

545
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,890
<i>929 must have his reasons.</i>

546
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,150
<i>No matter what his reasons are,</i>

547
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,880
<i>his doings have already broken the rules of the netherworld assassins.</i>

548
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:39,380
<i>City Leader, please give out an order to let us arrest 929.</i>

549
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,660
<i>What if he refuses to come back?</i>

550
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,080
<i>Then we can only kill him.</i>

551
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,890
<i>You all just leave first.</i>

552
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,420
<i>Yes.</i>

553
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,730
<i>City Leader.</i>

554
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,120
<i>No need to tell me, I already know why you are here.</i>

555
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,350
<i>I beg City Leader to spare Qian Zhen.</i>

556
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,130
<i>Qian Zhen must have his reasons.</i>

557
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,740
<i>I surely will investigate this matter well.</i>

558
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,610
<i>But first, we have to catch him and bring him back here first.</i>

559
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,010
<i>Or else, public opinion is powerful enough to melt metal.</i>

560
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,550
<i>I also won't have a way to help him anymore.</i>

561
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,880
<i>I couldn't win and got arrested by the camp leader</i>

562
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,630
<i>then imprisoned.</i>

563
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,790
<i>I thought that I would surely die that time.</i>

564
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,020
<i>City Leader.</i>

565
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,930
<i>Open the door.</i>

566
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,580
<i>City Leader, please.</i>

567
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,850
<i>City Leader?</i>

568
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,400
<i>All of you can leave.</i>

569
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,850
<i>Yes.</i>

570
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,880
<i>City Leader.</i>

571
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,150
<i>Teacher.</i>

572
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,850
<i>Teacher, why did you come?</i>

573
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,670
<i>Qian Zhen, I'm sorry.</i>

574
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,480
<i>I brought you into this city yet I let you walk onto this path.</i>

575
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,710
<i>Teacher, don't blame yourself.</i>

576
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,530
<i>This is a path that I chose on my own.</i>

577
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,620
<i>It has nothing to do with other people.</i>

578
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,960
<i>If not for this matter, I initially planned to really train you well</i>

579
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,750
<i>and pass you the city leader position in the future.</i>

580
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,520
<i>City Leader, what are these words that you are saying?</i>

581
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,540
<i>I don't have the capabilities</i>

582
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,780
<i>to be the leader of Yongzhou Underground City.</i>

583
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,900
<i>Other than me liking you as a person, there is also another reason.</i>

584
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,710
<i>If I let someone who grew up in the underground city to be the city leader,</i>

585
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,660
<i>when they are in power,</i>

586
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,230
<i>they will develop desire towards the outside world.</i>

587
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,410
<i>If by that time they will do some extreme measures,</i>

588
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,110
<i>the one who will suffer are my underground city citizens.</i>

589
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,830
<i>There isn't any more meaning to talk about these things.</i>

590
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:10,170
<i>From now on, we can only leave the fate of the underground city to Heaven's will and to destiny.</i>

591
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,070
<i>Qian Zhen,</i>

592
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,300
<i>hurry. Drink this medicine.</i>

593
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,180
<i>What is this?</i>

594
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,710
<i>This is the Nimble Transformation Pill that I created.</i>

595
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,550
<i>I initially created it to prolong the aging of city leader's body.</i>

596
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,650
<i>This medicine has one side effect.</i>

597
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,050
<i>But this side effect can exactly be useful at this time.</i>

598
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,090
<i>What is the side effect of this medicine?</i>

599
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:40,120
<i>After you take this medicine, within 10 hours,</i>

600
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,260
<i>you will lose all signs of life.</i>

601
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,820
<i>But after the effect resolves, you will regain your bodily functions.</i>

602
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:50,640
<i>When you wake up, we will have already transported you out of the city.</i>

603
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,340
<i>Child, come over here.</i>

604
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,110
<i>After you get out, you must take good care of yourself.</i>

605
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,520
<i>It's done.</i>

606
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,280
<i>Men!</i>

607
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,030
<i>City Leader, are you alright?</i>

608
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,880
<i>Qian Zhen tried to abduct me and escape.</i>

609
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,850
<i>He has already been knocked unconscious by me.</i>

610
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,020
<i>You go over there and take a look.</i>

611
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,580
<i>Yes.</i>

612
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,810
<i>City Leader, Qian Zheng is already dead.</i>

613
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:53,570
<i>Qian Zhen also worked for our Yongzhou's Assassin Camp a lot.</i>

614
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,620
<i>Take some people and carry him out of the city.</i>

615
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,190
<i>Look for a place and bury him.</i>

616
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,910
<i>Yes.</i>

617
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,200
<i>I can only help you until here.</i>

618
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,320
<i>The path that you will walk from now on will depend on you.</i>

619
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,560
<i>Qian Zhen, you must go as far away from here as possible.</i>

620
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,170
<i>Don't ever return.</i>

621
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,850
<i>From now on, you are free.</i>

622
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,960
After you left, I hoped that you would never return here.

623
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,770
But in the end, the person who asked you to return

624
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,830
was I.

625
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,860
But Teacher,

626
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,920
what exactly happened here in the underground city?

627
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,080
The prophecy of old city leader unfortunately has happened.

628
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,800
Lord Xiu Fu feels that he has abundant strength now

629
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,240
and wants to use the Magic Stars to summon God's Army.

630
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:12,340
Leading the underground city citizens to charge out towards the outside world.

631
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,650
He repeatedly came here to look for me

632
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,620
to ask for the medication to make the underground citizens be forever unafraid of the sun.

633
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,110
He's also coveting the Magic Stars, right?

634
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,830
If we let his plan succeed,

635
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,110
it will become a disaster for both the citizens of

636
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,290
the underground city and outside world.

637
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,380
Then Teacher, is there really such a medicine?

638
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,670
No.

639
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,000
But Lord Xiu Fu doesn't want to believe it.

640
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,840
To stop his plan, after careful thoughts, the only person who can help me

641
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,020
is only you.

642
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,270
No matter how sturdy a wood is, it can't win over a knife.

643
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,620
Did you travel far to come here to just watch me carve wood?

644
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,930
We came here to–

645
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:23,140
Actually sometimes, whether to become the knife or the wood,

646
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,080
is just a moment's decision.

647
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,460
Wood is wood.

648
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,220
A knife is a knife.

649
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,810
We came here this time to tell you

650
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,600
that something bad will happen to your ship.

651
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,010
You should go look for captain for such matters.

652
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,870
Why look for me?

653
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,880
Because your choice will determine the fate of all the lives on your ship.

654
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,690
I don't have such great capabilities.

655
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,810
If you've offended the capital, do you think you all can still live?

656
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,700
Which one is more difficult, living or dying?

657
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,110
Could it be that you like to die that much?

658
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,710
If everyone on the ship has died and only I survived,

659
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,500
how long do you think the sea god will let me live?

660
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,810
Where did that some sea god come from?

661
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,450
Here.

662
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,090
Stop wasting efforts.

663
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,260
I have a debt of gratitude towards Cheng Ming Pan.

664
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,200
I won't betray him.

665
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,600
Don't fret first.

666
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,820
Let's think of another way.

667
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,070
If it's still won't work,

668
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,650
- it's better to let me personally–<br>- No.

669
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,020
If he dies,

670
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,510
there won't be any use at all.

671
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,420
If we do battle with him face to face, we both are not his match.

672
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,590
Da Hu Zi is very famous for being heartless.

673
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,430
But if we continue to drag this out,

674
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,530
we will become very passive.

675
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,100
Let me try.

676
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,800
Who told you to come in?

677
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,820
If I can convince Da Hu Zi,

678
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,640
you must promise me one condition.

679
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,460
I don't know what you are talking about.

680
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,530
Get out.

681
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,740
Wait.

682
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,430
Let him speak.

683
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,370
What do you plan to do?

684
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,620
I don't need you to bother on how I will do it.

685
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,740
But I believe that I surely can convince Da Hu Zi.

686
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,890
I don't know from where are you getting this confidence of yours?
