00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,273
Hello. I am called Seo Yu Jin.

2
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,174
Who is she?

3
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:18,777
She is the new housekeeper girl.
The old one quit.

4
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:19,477
Go on and start working.

5
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,179
Yes.

6
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:25,784
Where did you find this young lady?

7
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:28,286
We can't find that old maid,
ever since the asteroid came.

8
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:32,090
Besides, with Min Hyeok in that state,
we need a maid. Okay, I'm off to the hospital.

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,992
Let's go together. 
Let me put Cheol Min down and...

10
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,295
No, No! You want to create hell
at the hospital like last time?

11
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,297
No, why would I?
Then it was that doctor fellow--

12
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:44,002
But wait. Min Hyeok's condition now must be 
absolutely a secret. Even from people like that.

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,305
If it's known in the company,
it's not that he'll have to quit as CEO right away,

14
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:52,010
but as our claim is that he was all healed at 
the first hospital, it was only secretly that
we could change hospitals.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,012
Well, who said anything about that?

16
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:56,614
- I also want to see Min Hyeok and--
- Do it later, please!

17
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:58,416
I will tell you how it turns out!

18
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,920
Also, there should be somebody at home. 
If all of us are at the hospital, 
who'll watch the house?

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,621
Will the "Eagle-5 Brothers" watch the house?

00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:04,522
What?

21
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,124
What? The Eagles are out, to watch the house?

Where are they?

23
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:14,833
Take care.

24
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,034
Here's the payment.

25
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:16,835
Thank you.

26
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,536
Sure.

27
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,845
You too take care.

28
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:28,747
Careful!

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,452
Are those things you have had for long?

30
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,054
Yeah.

31
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,656
For more than 20 years we used them.

32
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:41,659
The wooden chairs were made by my dad.

33
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:46,464
They will get a new home. Don't worry.

34
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,969
You're loaded.
Then it's a pork strips party tonight?

35
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:52,370
You aren't getting this, are you?

36
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,973
Minus the debt-payment,
the money left over is nothing.

37
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,875
You'd give me pork strips
once you get money, you said.

38
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:59,778
You're something else, man.
That was if we got our savings.

39
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,980
With someone who's fully broke
and wiping the floor,

40
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,082
you're now asking for
a pork strips meal?

41
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,483
True.

42
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:06,785
I see that.

43
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:08,987
Too dirty and disgusting,
I wont even eat it.

44
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:11,289
Pork strips?

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,391
Fine, lets eat that.

46
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:15,994
Anyway a promise is promise, right?

47
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:18,596
Today is not so good. 
Tomorrow evening.

48
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,499
It's fine. 
I too have self-respect.

49
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,700
Pork strips?

50
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,103
Quit it. Not much fun.

51
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:37,916
This is... me, you mean?

52
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:41,319
Yes. That is a mirror, right?

53
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,720
How do you find your looks?

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,122
You like it?

55
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,024
You grew handsome, you think?

56
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:49,327
Yes. I've grown handsome. Extremely...

57
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:54,132
Good. We will go to the inspection room and
do some more of the mental tests.

58
00:02:54,232 --> 00:02:56,034
- Yes.
- Please come this way.

59
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:57,836
Okay.

60
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,238
What do we do with him?

61
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:01,639
Please don't worry too much.

62
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,344
It is a kind of dissociative amnesia.
You can say that it's a bit extreme.

63
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:11,049
As such cases involve more of psychological
issues than any particular brain abnormality,

64
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:15,754
there are many cases when the memory slowly
returns once the mind gets relaxed from rest.

65
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:17,155
Oh, okay.

66
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:22,260
Plus, as the patient himself is
happy with how he appears at present,

67
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,462
we can expect even better results.

68
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:25,163
Is that so?

69
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,165
Yes. Didn't you see it now?

70
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:31,369
Seeing the great changes in one's own looks
can be shocking, and can feel quite bad.

71
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:36,474
But he feels himself to have grown
handsome. Extremely so, he felt!

72
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,476
This doesn't happen that often.

73
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:41,479
But isn't he handsome, in fact?
Extremely.

74
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,783
Oh, you think so?
Okay.

75
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:46,484
This feels quite strange.

76
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:51,589
The hospital is changed suddenly.
Which hospital it is, stays a secret.

77
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:53,591
Hospital visits aren't allowed either.

78
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,494
They are obviously hiding something.

79
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:58,096
Isn't it enough to 
check with the first hospital,

80
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,198
how his condition was
up here, before he left?

81
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,799
Of course I asked.

82
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,601
But what was bad
had all healed, they said.

83
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:05,003
If he's all healed
we have to kill him quickly.

84
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:07,405
Is killing somebody
so easy for you to speak of?

85
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:08,907
It goes wrong, and we are finished.

86
00:04:08,907 --> 00:04:11,810
Then what else to do, idiot?
If that USB is seen, we are finished.

87
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,712
It could be a lie that 
he's all healed, you idiot.

88
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,414
If must be true, you idiot.

89
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,616
Even if he's all healed,
he could've been quietly moved.

90
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:21,619
Even if the USB is opened, one may
just not see that folder, you idiot.

91
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:24,122
Fine. Like a pacifist would say,
let's just wait a bit.

92
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:27,225
Yessir. I win.
It is 1 to 0.

93
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:38,236
Yeah, fine. 
I see. Be careful.

94
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:43,341
Damn, you jobless fellow.
I already said no. We cannot.

95
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:45,744
Grandfather, I'll do a bit of room cleaning.

96
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:52,550
When my grandson is hurt and in hospital,
you want to bring friends and have fun? 
How muddle-headed is that?

97
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,153
Ah, you fellow, really...

98
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:58,957
Then quietly come over for a cup of tea.

99
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,870
- You also get up. 
- Get up.

100
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,873
You have no sense of how to have fun!

101
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,286
Let's have a quiet tea, I said.
Who asked you to have a dance party?

102
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:34,392
It's the heaven's wish! There are 2 bright moons
up there, and we should be having our fun.
Make way, make way.

103
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,694
Punk.

104
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:45,603
Yes.

105
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,605
Nothing much, really.

106
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:51,509
It would be good if what goes on today
is kept a secret from my daughter-in-law.

107
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:52,410
What?

108
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,713
These days, things aren't so
hunky-dory around here.

109
00:05:55,713 --> 00:06:00,718
I only just wanted them to come for a chat today.
Who knew he would create a pandemonium?

110
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,221
Yes, I understand.

111
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,223
I'll keep it a secret.

112
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:07,826
That's it. A secret.

113
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:14,432
Why does rain come so suddenly back to back
like this, making us go mad?

114
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:18,236
But I guess we should be happy to
still have some roof over us.

115
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:19,738
But what will we do?

116
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:20,939
The day after tomorrow
we'll have to move.

117
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,841
This is all because of whom?

118
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,442
Still saying such things shamelessly?

119
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:27,946
Hey, stop this, you wretched girl. You're so damn
young, how come you're so unable to let it go?

120
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:29,447
A girl who should use her time
to think about her future.

121
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:32,250
You think this is about the future? 
What the heck do we do day after tomorrow?

122
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,853
Fine, fine. I should just die so many times.

123
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:35,653
Turn off the flame for the broth!

124
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:37,255
I know!

125
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:37,956
What soup is it?

126
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:41,059
Pollack fish. 
Check the taste. See if it's too salty.

127
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,560
Not so! Tastes great!

128
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,162
Then ask the next-door guy to eat with us!

129
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,865
I got it!

130
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:49,267
What?

131
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:52,070
I am scared. 
Because it's dark.

132
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:58,276
<i>Hey... Hongberg.</i>

133
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,281
No problems, right?

134
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,482
Yes.

135
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,985
I thought you would be sleeping
at the hospital tonight.

136
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:12,290
I was supposed to, but our youngest daughter
wanted to stay there with her dad.

137
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,794
Why are there so many rice wine bottles?

138
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:20,198
That is...

139
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:22,600
What is all this?

140
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,604
I kinda like a bit of rice wine, so...

141
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:31,910
So you mean you drank 
all this rice wine all by yourself?

142
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:34,512
In your room?

143
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:35,513
Okay, I see.

144
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:38,016
You came back?
Aren't you staying tonight at the hospital?

145
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:41,419
Su Yeong said she would stay there.

146
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,922
Leave that aside, father-in-law, 
why in the world would you do that?

147
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:44,522
What?

148
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:48,326
I was told you had your friends over
for a dance party during the day.

149
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,529
When Min Hyeok is in that state,
this is what you'd want to do?

150
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:52,831
No. It is that old fart Gim who--

151
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,135
Oh come on, what's with this old fart Gim always?
Is old fart Gim the house-owner here?

152
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,136
Sorry.

153
00:07:58,136 --> 00:08:02,340
Oh please, act your age for God's sake.

154
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,142
Who is it?

155
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:05,343
What?

156
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:08,146
Who said I did it?
Was it her? Yu Jin or whatnot.

157
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:10,749
If so, what do you want to do? 
You want to take revenge?

158
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:13,852
No, no! Not so.

159
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:20,357
We'll just wait and see.

160
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,264
Keep the leftover soup in the refrigerator?

161
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:30,568
The refrigerator also should have been sold
earlier if we could get a few tens of thousands.
(few 10s of US$)

162
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,971
Nobody will want this kind of thing for that.

163
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,272
Thanks for the meal.

164
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,273
I'm going.

165
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,778
But if it keeps raining like this, will you be fine?
Doesn't it leak at your place?

166
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:42,080
Not so.
I didn't even know it was raining.

167
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,382
You punk. Isn't that itself a disease, really!

168
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,986
That's right, in fact. If it rains like this,
how will you sleep? It's just a shed.

169
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,189
Take a sleeping bag and sleep here.
With no furniture, it's like a playground here!

170
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:51,990
It's fine.

171
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,492
Yeah right, fine!
You'll be here just as you say it, right?

172
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,995
Not so.

173
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:03,001
Your disease really needs to be treated.
You know that you really make others annoyed?

174
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:06,604
- Not so.
- You punk, you really need this to cure it.

175
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:08,606
When you guys are like this,
it's just like you are siblings.

176
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:10,008
Say what, the horror!

177
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:16,014
It's not even 9 o'clock, but we sleep. 
The TV also is gone.

178
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,117
Ah, this is crap... There's nothing to do.

179
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,219
Shall we play hwatu?
(Korean card game)

180
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:22,520
We have no hwatu cards.

181
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,022
Oh, that's right, that's right.

182
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,323
Shall I go buy it?

183
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:28,727
No, forget it.
Buy what, in this rain?

184
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:32,630
Like we see on TV or something,
there must be some game we can play.

185
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,733
Why don't we try something?

186
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,634
Like there is some game...

187
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:38,236
Don't you know some fun game?

188
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:39,437
No clue.

189
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:40,438
You just might know, right?

190
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,242
What I know are only Bear-paw Jigsaw-puzzle
Mafia-007 Spacecraft-0 Eye-expression-game

191
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:47,345
Corpse-drops-from-sky Cola-drinking like that.

192
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:52,550
What do we do first? 
Which will be the best?

193
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,855
=From the Bongcheon-dong accident scene,
this is CJB News' Gim U Hyeon.=

194
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,558
They are still showing this news?

195
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,361
Yeah, like Today's Weather, every day.

196
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:11,369
=Hello everybody. Asteroid 2013QR3 is presently
maintaining a 33 000 kilometers height.=

197
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:14,672
=For every revolution around the Earth,
it takes about 16 weeks.=

198
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:21,679
=As it is much faster than how the moon revolves,
if you look carefully, you can feel them
moving apart gradually.=

199
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,285
=Just that, as the entire mainland has rain today,
it's only in Jeju Island that the asteroid is visible.=

200
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:27,986
Bear paw paw, my palm palm.

201
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:28,887
My palm palm, bear paw paw.

202
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:29,888
Bear paw paw, horse hoof hoof.

203
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:30,688
Horse hoof hoof, my palm palm.

204
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:31,689
My palm palm, bear paw paw.

205
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,591
Bear paw paw. Horse pa pa.

206
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,993
That was all slurred!

207
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:37,195
What? Who said it wasn't right?

208
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:40,799
Awawawawawawawawoy... Indiaaaan... BAM!

209
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:45,904
Might as well poke me with a fork!

210
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:48,406
Yes, I won that!

211
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:50,108
Hey, you came last.

212
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:53,211
I'm a girl, you know! 
Just this once, can't we forget it?

213
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,214
You sure know we can't!
Bend over!

214
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,719
I won that! Yahooooo....

215
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,122
Where are you going?

216
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:04,923
Let me off once please.

217
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:08,927
Fine. Then show something you're good at.
If we like it, we'll let you off.

218
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,329
There's nothing like that.

219
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,031
Pak Yeong Gyu.

220
00:11:13,031 --> 00:11:15,033
Aigooma...

221
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,735
So close, so close.

222
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:18,636
Better be exact.
Do another.

223
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:21,539
Im Jae Beom.

224
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,142
Suppose I...

225
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:28,747
Fine, right? You'll let me off?

226
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:29,948
What let-off?

227
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:32,050
Stay still.

228
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,876
I asked not to talk
but the dimwit can't get it.

229
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,478
Hey. Look here.

230
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,484
Where is she?

231
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:11,389
What are you doing here?

232
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:12,690
I came to grab the clothes to wash.

233
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,094
If you are getting clothes to wash,
why are you flipping the pockets?

234
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:17,695
I was checking if it had pockets.

235
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,298
You weren't just turning it over, the way I saw.

236
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,699
Huh?

237
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,700
What are you...

238
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,402
What is going on?
What is the issue?

239
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:26,104
This is very suspicious.

240
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:27,205
What is?

241
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,707
She was flipping Min Hyeok's pants pockets.
I caught her red-handed.

242
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,911
Before putting them in for laundry,
I was checking for pockets.

243
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:34,913
Fine, I know. Take it and go.

244
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:37,615
You know, you said? 
How come you won't believe my words?

245
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:39,217
You think I'm saying some nonsense?

246
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,519
Would you please stop that?
You make it difficult for your own heart.

247
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,223
Just because it's difficult, it is fine to let
a thief remain at home with no concern?

248
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,226
Because she ratted on you, you are now
finding fault with her, aren't you?

249
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,329
What finding fault? 
I saw her flipping pockets.

250
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:53,932
To wash clothes, can't people flip pockets?

251
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:56,334
Sure I also know that 
pockets are flipped before washing.

252
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:58,536
But while flipping
she did it very suspiciously.

253
00:12:58,536 --> 00:12:59,738
Like this, like this, like this, you see.

254
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,540
Oh, enough of that.
Please don't be like this.

255
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,943
This woman! Seriously...

256
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:10,148
There is surely something about that girl...

257
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,180
Not asleep?

258
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,682
Yeah.

259
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:47,185
The rain keeps coming.

260
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:08,106
From now on we won't have a house either.

261
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:10,208
How long have you lived in this house?

262
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,210
Since I was 3 years old.

263
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,512
Dad had bought his first house.

264
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:18,917
Once Dad passed away, it became 
rented yearly and then rented monthly.

265
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,719
Eventually we were chased out.

266
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,523
So losing out was a way of life, I guess.

267
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,529
This still remains here?

268
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:32,430
What?

269
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,133
From my dad measuring my height.

270
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:38,436
This is from the last time Dad measured me.

271
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,638
He passed away when you were 6 years old?

272
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:42,741
Yes.

273
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:45,744
The pencil marks are
what I did myself.

274
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:48,646
To show Dad if he were to come back.

275
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,749
But he passed away, you said?

276
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,951
Because I didn't see it with my eyes.

277
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:56,054
So, may he would come back, I hoped.

278
00:14:58,757 --> 00:15:03,161
Then I used to get the same dream everyday.

279
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:08,767
Dad coming back,
opening the door with a smile.

280
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,975
Here is where it ended?
That dream?

281
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,289
You said both your dad and mom
are no more, right?

282
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:34,192
Then in whose house did you live?

283
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:43,902
Gyeonggi-do, Yangju city, Janghyeong-dae, 5-12.
House number 5.

284
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:01,319
<i>Look at this. 
Wasn't I right that she's a thief?</i>

285
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:03,221
What's wrong?

286
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,023
That Seo Yu Jin or Seo Yu Beer,
where did she go?

287
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:06,124
To the shop. What's it now?

288
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:09,527
My gold ring has disappeared.
It was worth so much money.

289
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:11,830
You let a total thief be in this house.

290
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,032
Based on what proof 
do you think that she took it?

291
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,834
Because it disappeared 
after my room was cleaned.

292
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,335
Did you look for it anywhere else?

293
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:20,038
Of course I looked.
It's not there anywhere.

294
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:21,639
It's her. No doubt it's her.

295
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,741
Really?

296
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:25,043
What really? 
Since yesterday's thing, he has kept at it.

297
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:25,543
Is that so?

298
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:26,845
What was so, you said?

299
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:29,547
- Come on father, for no reason-- 
- I will get you. Eat this and stop up.

300
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:32,250
Ah, father. Ah...
You shouldn't be accusing...

301
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,552
I should go and rummage through her things.

302
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:38,056
Father-in-law, you needlessly doubt an innocent
one, and if it wasn't her, what will you do?

303
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:40,759
These days if he take domestic helps lightly,
you could get sued.

304
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,162
On some hunch with no evidence,
you can't suspect people!

305
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:49,167
Evidence? You see when I check into her things.
It will come out. No mistaking.

306
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:50,768
Is there some problem?

307
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:53,971
You happened to return?

308
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,679
Saw everything? Is that enough now?

309
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,681
My pockets also...

310
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:05,383
It's fine. I know you wouldn't do it.

311
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:09,287
If an elderly won't get convinced now and wants
to blame you, rather let him rummage. Sorry.

312
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:12,791
No, it's nothing. 
Rather than be suspected, this is better.

313
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,293
Where she put it won't be easy to find.

314
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:18,997
You. I am watching you!

315
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:22,801
Could you please stop this? Seriously...

316
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,803
What kind of scallion-pancake
is it for you to eat like this?

317
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:29,207
Father took such a big piece
and stuffed in my mouth.

318
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:31,409
Now I have to eat all of it.

319
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:32,310
Bear paw paw. Horse hoof hoof

320
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,311
Horse hoof hoof. Bear paw paw.

321
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:34,212
Bear paw paw. Horse hoof hoof.

322
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:35,113
Horse hoof hoof. Bear paw paw.

323
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:36,614
Bear paw paw. Horse Pa Pa.

324
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:40,318
You got it wrong, just wait.
Indiaaaan... BAM!

325
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:43,221
You can go now.

326
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:45,423
When's the bus coming?

327
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:50,228
In 3 minutes.

328
00:17:50,228 --> 00:17:52,630
That seems right.

329
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,833
Why did you sit? Go on.

330
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,134
To annoy you.

331
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,444
Wait a moment.

332
00:18:06,444 --> 00:18:07,345
Why?

333
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:08,947
I'll install a fun thing.

334
00:18:08,947 --> 00:18:10,148
What's it?

335
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:11,750
Just for when we're bored...

336
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,054
It's still a beta version.
Right now the users are only you and me.

337
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,956
Here.

338
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:19,958
Near U?

339
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,159
What is this?

340
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,461
Click it.

341
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,263
You see those blue and red icons there?

342
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:27,565
The blue one is me, and the red one is you.

343
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,167
It will show me where you are currently?

344
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:32,470
Yeah. If the connected person
is within a 1 kilometer radius,

345
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,472
at that time "Near U" will flicker.

346
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:35,874
If you press it, it will show the location.

347
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:37,175
What is this?

348
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:39,677
There are many others that track
people from even farther distance.

349
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:41,780
This will show it only from within 1 kilometer?

350
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,181
Isn't this outdated?

351
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:45,884
That's why it's still a beta version
needing a lot of tweaking.

352
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:48,686
Still when it's pitch-black on the street,
won't you be happy to see the light flicker?

353
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:52,991
Say you have come to the lane at night.
If it flickers, it's like "Oh, Hongberg is here".

354
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,192
You'll be happy. Isn't that good?

355
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:58,897
Bullshit. Plus, once we leave this neighborhood,
aren't we done with you coming to get me?

356
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:00,899
Ah, damn crap. Isn't that right?

357
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:03,101
Impossible.

358
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,703
The bus is here.

359
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:15,413
I'll buy pork strips and come in the evening.
Wait for that.

360
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:17,715
Okay.

361
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,667
<i>Then just give it to me now.</i>

362
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,871
<i>Huh?
First send me a photo of the bill.</i>

363
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:18,476
<i>There's no need to see it. Where I live, 
dry cleaning is without a doubt just 10 000.</i>
(~US$ 8)

364
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:22,280
<i>I have no cash now. 
Get in touch with me. Understood?</i>

365
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,794
Damn, he never contacted me.

366
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:41,299
Why?

367
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,302
Grandpa got conjunctivitis?

368
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:46,104
I understand.

369
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:48,406
Grandpa.

370
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:49,407
Grandpa, what's wrong?

371
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:50,408
The conjunctivitis is this serious?

372
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:53,011
That's right. 
Can't even open my eyes.

373
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:54,913
I'll do it.

374
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:56,014
How did this happen?

375
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:56,815
I don't know about that.

376
00:20:56,815 --> 00:20:58,516
Till the morning he seemed fine.

377
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:02,120
I wasn't fine even in the morning.
It's just that you didn't know.

378
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,622
Aigoo, now I can't see anything at all.

379
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:07,525
Su Yeong. Take me to my room.

380
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:11,930
If it's so bad that you can't see, what do we do?

381
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,432
What do we do?

382
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,334
I'm all just fine.

383
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:18,737
Then you were lying? Why?

384
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:22,741
This maid is a thief who I saw flipping the
pockets of Min Hyeok's pants in his room.

385
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:26,044
Knowing that I am watching her,
she's suddenly all careful.

386
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:27,645
So this is a trap I am setting!

387
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:28,847
Grandpa, seriously!

388
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:31,349
These days if we let anyone in the house,
we can't drop our guard, right?

389
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:33,151
Then when the time comes,
I can catch her red-handed.

390
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:35,954
But if you are wearing this,
you can't see anything at all, no?

391
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:39,758
You think I'm a fool?
I removed the gauze inside. I see everything.

392
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,558
Really?

393
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:41,960
You don't believe me?

394
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,462
Then you let a punch fly at me.

395
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:47,665
Like this? 
Whoa...

396
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,668
What do you think now?

397
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:53,471
This is a secret between just us both, okay?

398
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:54,873
I'm back.

399
00:21:54,873 --> 00:21:56,975
Why are you panting like this?

400
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:59,577
To get through the lane before sunset,
I was running.

401
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:00,979
I bought pork strips.

402
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,083
Wow, you bought fresh meat?
Not frozen?

403
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,987
Yeah. Isn't it our last dinner with
Hongberg in this house?

404
00:22:08,987 --> 00:22:11,689
I had scolded him a lot all this while,
so I spent some money.

405
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,592
It's a good thing. Ask him to come.

406
00:22:16,494 --> 00:22:19,397
Don't grill it yet, okay?
I want to show it to Hongberg.

407
00:22:19,497 --> 00:22:21,299
<i>Hey, Hongberg!</i>

408
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:25,703
I bought pork strips as promised.
Say thanks and come to...

409
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:34,112
Why are you back alone?

410
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:35,914
That brat isn't there.
He went somewhere?

411
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:36,815
Did he go somewhere?

412
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,216
I don't know.

413
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:39,918
His things aren't there either.

414
00:22:39,918 --> 00:22:42,921
I had told him in the morning that
I would come with pork strips.

415
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:43,922
Where did he go?

416
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:45,323
Call and see, where he is.

417
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,425
Call?

418
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:50,528
But to do that, I don't know his phone number!

419
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:53,031
After being so close,
you don't even know his number?

420
00:22:53,031 --> 00:22:54,833
I was seeing him here at home every day.

421
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,635
Ah, right. 
The app from this morning.

422
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:02,640
If he was within a 1 kilometer radius,
"Near U" was supposed to show it.

423
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,342
He seems not to be 
within a 1 kilometer radius.

424
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:07,345
Won't that thing
know the phone number?

425
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:08,646
It would seem so.

426
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,348
But I have no way to find it.

427
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,450
Would he have gone somewhere
as something urgent came up?

428
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,552
What do we do with these pork strips?

429
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:20,458
Tonight let's just eat some bagged food and...
The pork strips, we'll eat it with him tomorrow.

430
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,866
Even after buying fresh pork,
it seems we are only eating frozen stuff.

431
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:37,475
Don't be so out of it. 
You should take the eye-patch off at least to eat.

432
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:39,177
No, it's all right.

433
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:42,180
Su Yeong.
Put some item on this.

434
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,581
It is some egg.

435
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:45,183
It's so bad that you can't see anything?

436
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:48,386
No, I can't. 
I can't see a thing.

437
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:51,289
Hey, your mouth is here.

438
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,691
Ah, I told you, I can't see a thing!

439
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:54,893
Will you be at home today?

440
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,095
No. I have to go out. 
I have to meet some friends.

441
00:23:57,095 --> 00:24:00,398
Then what to do? 
Till I reach the hospital to send your mom home,

442
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,100
who will take care of your grandpa?

443
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,202
No need to bother about me.

444
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:06,004
I'm just fine being by myself.

445
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:08,706
It's Min Hyeok you should take care of.

446
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:11,810
Over here!

447
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:21,119
Next-door youngster,
you there?

448
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,720
In the morning itself
you want to have pork strips?

449
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,723
It was in the fridge yesterday.
I felt we should eat it soon.

450
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:27,225
Next-door youngster!

451
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,627
I'll go and see.

452
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:44,142
Grandfather.

453
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:45,944
Please move your feet a bit.

454
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,446
- What? You are cleaning right in front?
- Yes.

455
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:51,950
I just can't see a thing,
how would I know?

456
00:24:56,354 --> 00:24:58,156
<i>Bingo!</i>

457
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:06,464
Caught red-handed, you!

458
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,167
What are you flipping around now? What?

459
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,468
What is it, grandfather?

460
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:11,970
What is it?

461
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,573
You crafty little devil.
You think I can't see, right?

462
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:19,677
It was to catch you stealing stuff
that I put on a show, do you see?

463
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:22,080
Then you were
deliberately doing it because of me?

464
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,282
Now that I caught you doing it,
you've nothing to say now, do you?

465
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:26,484
What did you catch me doing, you mean?

466
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:29,988
You stole my ring. Now you're caught
stealing from Min Hyeok's drawer!

467
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,991
For the ring, I rummaged through everything.

468
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,793
I'm just arranging his drawer.

469
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:37,095
So you will deny it all the way through?

470
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:38,096
Fine, then.

471
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:39,397
You come here.

472
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,303
Father-in-law, what are you doing?

473
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,005
Ah, you came just on time.

474
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,807
I caught her right at the scene of the crime.

475
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:50,308
What scene of the crime?

476
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,609
No, it's not so. It wasn't.

477
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:54,012
We'll see if it wasn't.
Call the police. Police.

478
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,114
First take your hands off, then talk.

479
00:25:56,114 --> 00:25:57,115
What happened here?

480
00:25:57,115 --> 00:26:02,120
I mean, I was just fixing the room.
He kept saying I was stealing something.

481
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,922
Whatever explanation I give, doesn't work.

482
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:06,624
Wow, take a look at her acting!

483
00:26:06,624 --> 00:26:08,126
Seems like the real thing, you!

484
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:09,427
Why not be a TV actress or something?

485
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:10,929
Would you please stop, seriously?

486
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,331
Stop what, you mean? 
I caught her in the act.

487
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:14,933
I have to find my ring, don't I?

488
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,835
You searched through all her things, right?

489
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:19,738
After you lost it somewhere,
why do you do this to an innocent girl?

490
00:26:19,738 --> 00:26:21,239
Look at you talk!

491
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,341
If I were to lose the ring,
how and where could it be?

492
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:26,244
Come on, you are always going up and down
for doing something on the balcony.

493
00:26:26,244 --> 00:26:27,645
Did you check there also?

494
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:29,748
What, you think I have turned senile or what?

495
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:31,449
I looked everywhere. It's not there.

496
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:32,851
Without even checking, you say this.

497
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:34,452
What do you mean I haven't checked?

498
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:36,654
You go and take a look, then!

499
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:41,059
Who does she think is stupid here? 
If the ring was here, why wouldn't I see it?

500
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,161
Oh damn, crap!

501
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:45,263
It's not anywhere here?

502
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:48,466
Where would it be? It's not here.

503
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:02,580
Hongberg came back?

504
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,885
The final demolition notice has come.
They'll be tearing it down starting tomorrow.

505
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,992
Then it seems we'll have to pack up soon today.

506
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:17,495
For now, can we go to may be a motel?

507
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:19,898
To keep some luggage,
a sauna house may be better.

508
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:21,299
It is not that I'm suspecting you.

509
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,602
But as long as the ring isn't found,
the old man will keep hassling you so much.

510
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:26,905
If you were to continue here,
it can only get harder.

511
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:30,208
For not being able to do anymore
than this for you, I'm sorry.

512
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:34,012
Thank you.

513
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:38,116
Bye.

514
00:27:45,924 --> 00:27:49,928
Grandfather, please stay healthy.

515
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:20,759
Hi, it's me.

516
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,361
This was a failure.

517
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:28,066
With that old man who should be dead constantly 
picking faults with me, how could I even work?

518
00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:31,970
I wanted to beat him up half-way to death,
but stopped myself, barely.

519
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:06,765
It would've been nice to eat with him,
but he disappeared without a word, it seems.

520
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,968
This is the last dinner in this house too.

521
00:30:19,477 --> 00:30:22,180
It's quite tasty.

522
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:49,407
Why do you cry?

523
00:30:49,507 --> 00:30:51,609
I don't know.

524
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:20,739
A little bit more.
Aigoo, aigoo.

525
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:21,740
That's it.

526
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,442
Aigoo. That's it. 
Yeah, that's it. Aigoo.

527
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:37,055
Bye.

528
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:43,061
Mom, wait a moment.

529
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:27,906
-=Next Episode Preview=-

530
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:28,706
What's wrong?

531
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:30,809
Lately, the pee is a bit...

532
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:33,211
There is a tumor here. On this side.

533
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:35,613
This won't work. You just go to work.

534
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:36,614
Mom, what are you trying to do?

535
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:38,016
I will roll it and go.

536
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:41,519
Help me keep it a secret. 
I am in deep confusion.

537
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,221
Brat, are you crazy?

538
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:45,023
What is this you're doing,
sitting in the alley?

539
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:47,325
Then what to do? 
This is too big to keep anywhere.

540
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:50,528
- Is it Bo Yeong? The daughter I love most...
- Hold on, I'll call you later.

541
00:32:50,528 --> 00:32:51,730
Isn't this your company?

542
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,431
Let's spend this night here.

543
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:58,036
Mom!
I'm following you soon.
