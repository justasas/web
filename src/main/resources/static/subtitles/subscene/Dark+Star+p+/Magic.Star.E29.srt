2
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,370
How come there are two people here?

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,300
They are even dreaming.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,390
This fatty only knows to eat.

5
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Come with me then.

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,700
What's going on?

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,820
Where is Yuan Shuai?

8
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,000
Yuan Shuai!

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,800
Where am I?

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,800
Yuan Shuai!

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,800
Yuan Shuai!

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,100
Yuan Shuai!

13
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Zhan Xiong Fei! Zhan Xiong Fei!

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,900
Zi Su!

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,000
Zi Su!

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,550
Why are you here?

17
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,200
Where are we?

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,800
Zhan Xiong Fei, were you thinking about me?

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,300
Zhan Xiong Fei, hug me, okay?

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,900
Hug me. Hug me, okay?

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,700
Zhan Xiong Fei, if you don't come over to hug me, I'll go over to hug you then.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,000
- Zhan Xiong Fei.<br>- Hey, don't come near!

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,800
You are not Zi Su.

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
Tell me, who are you really?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,190
You are quite smart.

26
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,000
I am indeed not Zi Su.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,800
You... What kind of thing are you?!

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
I am Babe Ya, Baby Ya.

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
I don't care if you are some Baby Ya or Baby Yan.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,600
Let me tell you. I've seen so many demons and monsters. You can't scare me.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,970
Can't you tell good from bad?

32
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,500
I am here to help you.

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,460
If not because I saw that you were upright and brave even though you are an ungrateful one,

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,000
I wouldn't be minding your business.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,480
Hurry and save that lady.

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
She is in big trouble.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,900
Huh? What?

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
Where is Older Bro Fei?

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,720
Where could Older Bro Fei have gone?

40
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,700
Older Bro Fei!

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,100
Older Bro Fei!

42
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,980
Older Bro Fei!

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,200
Come.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,400
- Two good brothers! Eight horses!<br>- Here.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Why didn't you inform me beforehand?

46
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,940
Isn't it just one pigeon who flew here?

47
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,950
What is the big deal?

48
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,060
That is how I communicate with the people on the mainland.

49
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,470
A black pigeon means that something bad has happened there.

50
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,170
What bad thing can happen?

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
A very severe matter.

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
How severe can it be?

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,200
When my supplier got exposed before, he didn't even send over a black pigeon.

54
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,600
This time, it means that our island is in danger.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,200
How sure are you that the problem comes from my cargo?

56
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,400
The cargo before were all just fabrics, leathers, cigarettes, and silk.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Only your cargo led to a problem.

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
Let me ask you. Why did you steal from a government ship and not tell me?

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
Why can't I steal from a government ship?

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
There are rules in your kind of business. You know that very well.

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,110
One must not touch the government's ship.

62
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,600
It will bring in disaster.

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,100
I am a pirate!

64
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,110
In my territory, there is only being able to rob or not.

65
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,600
There is not a case of allowing to rob or not.

66
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,500
You will eat the fruits of what you sow sooner or later.

67
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,960
I'll wait for that day.

68
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,060
Come. Drink!

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
Older Bro Fei!

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,460
Why is he gone so suddenly?

71
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,200
What has really happened?

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Older Bro Fei!

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,300
Older Bro Fei!

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,470
Older Bro Fei, where have you really gone to?

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,200
Big Bro! Big Bro!

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Just want to ask. Have you seen a quite tall and ruffian looking guy?

77
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
I didn't see one.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,400
He is very thin, about... a half of me.

79
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,470
And then when he walks, he is like this,

80
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,000
swinging side to side, very unique, right? You must know about it, right?

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I really didn't see him.

82
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,600
Oh, right, I have one final trick.

83
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Look. I have a drawing.

84
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
This is our house.

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,820
This is me.

86
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,000
This is Thirteenth Older Sis.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,570
This is Zhan Xiong Fei, the Older Bro Fei that I'm looking for.

88
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,000
He really is very important to me. Have you seen him?

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,300
I really didn't see him.

90
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,300
- Fine then.<br>- Hey!

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,670
Oh, right. There is a small shop up ahead.

92
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,000
Foreigners usually go there.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,100
How about you go there to take a look?

94
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,310
Thank you, Big Bro!

95
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,300
Okay. You're welcome.

96
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,000
I didn't find the corpses of your friends.

97
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,510
I asked around everywhere but I found no news about them.

98
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,880
This probably is a form of good news.

99
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,600
It's just a bit better than some news about their death.

100
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,220
Still not contented?

101
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,400
Do you really have to see their corpses?

102
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,500
Lady Boss, can you not have a devil's tongue?

103
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
I want to ask for leave today.

104
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,050
I am not in the mood to work.

105
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,800
Are your friends that important?

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,400
Don't you have any sincere friends at all?

107
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,800
If you want me to help you find them, it's not impossible, either.

108
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,800
What do you mean?

109
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,040
In every pirate bay, it is indeed difficult to find people.

110
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,800
But it depends on who is looking.

111
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,240
As long as you can help me find my friends,

112
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,600
I won't refuse to do any dangerous thing for you.

113
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,150
No need.

114
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,800
You just need to accompany me to one place and it's enough.

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,390
Don't worry. If there are indeed very dangerous situations,

116
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,200
it won't be your turn to go.

117
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,590
Okay.

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,800
This must be the place.

119
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,700
Owner!

120
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,270
Waiter!

121
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,810
How come no one is here?

122
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,750
This wouldn't be some racketeering shop, right?

123
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,050
Oh, no! Oh, no!

124
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,170
Although Older Bro Fei usually looks very quick-witted,

125
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,900
he actually is very stupid.

126
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
He wouldn't have been tricked, right?

127
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Older Bro Fei! Older Bro Fei! Older Bro Fei!

128
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
You two are indeed running a racketeering shop, aren't you?

129
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,570
Let me tell you. Hurry and hand over my Older Bro Fei

130
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,400
or else I won't be courteous with you.

131
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Don't think that because you know martial arts, we'll be scared of you.

132
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,300
You were sent by Xiao Dao, right?

133
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,310
Threatening and intimidating doesn't work.

134
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,680
Right now, you guys are starting to use despicable means like slandering and framing.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,370
I don't know any Older Bro Fei or Older Bro Gou.

136
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,700
Go back and tell Xiao Dao...

137
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,420
tell him not to cause trouble here again.

138
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,300
He better just give up on this as early as possible.

139
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,200
I really don't know the Xiao Dao you are talking about. Let me tell you.

140
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Earlier, somebody told me that Older Bro Fei followed the road and came here.

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
On this road, there's only your shop.

142
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,710
If my Older Bro Fei didn't come here, where else can he go?

143
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,000
Hurry and hand him over.

144
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,510
Older sis, did we make a mistake?

145
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,400
He doesn't look like a bad guy.

146
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Younger sister, aren't you being too naive?

147
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,800
Will a bad guy write 'bad guy' on his face?

148
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Moreover, Xiao Dao posted a note on our door yesterday.

149
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,670
He said that he'll come here at noon.

150
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,600
The time right now is exactly that.

151
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
If it is not him, who else can it be?

152
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Hey, I say... Can you ask your boss to come out? I'll talk to him.

153
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,520
I am the owner.

154
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,560
You?

155
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,770
Owner?

156
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,400
I don't believe it.

157
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,580
Stop pretending already.

158
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,650
Let's just be straightforward and be frank about things.

159
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,660
I can see that your martial arts skills are quite good,

160
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,130
but you don't look to have a proper job.

161
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,300
Tell me, how much did Xiao Dao give you

162
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,730
to let you serve him?

163
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,920
How come I can't understand anything that you are saying?

164
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,450
I am just here to look for one person.

165
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,520
Aren't you all just bullying us sisters for having no people to rely on?

166
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Let me tell you. Older Bro Ying Jun will be here soon.

167
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,870
By that time, you won't even have the time to cry!

168
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,720
How come there is some Ying Jun now?

169
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,230
After saying so much, we actually get our wires crossed.

170
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,440
Xiao Mei, he really can act.

171
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,810
Not joining the theater group and be there main star is really a waste.

172
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,490
Fine. Fine. I won't ask anymore. Is that okay?

173
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,310
I'll just go look for him on my own.

174
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,190
Stop!

175
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,360
Hurry and just go back.

176
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,290
Stop doing evil things with Older Bro Xiao Dao.

177
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,010
Even if Older Bro Ying Jun won't be able to come back,

178
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,470
Xiao Dao will still get the retribution he deserves sooner or later.

179
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,880
Xiao Mei, who said that Older Bro Ying Jun won't be able to come back?

180
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,980
You are not allowed to say those kinds of words in the future.

181
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,870
No. No. No. I said it wrong.

182
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,230
Older Bro Ying Jun will surely come back.

183
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,530
What really is going on here, Heaven!

184
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,860
Save me!

185
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,630
- Xiao Dao...<br>- Xiao Dao...

186
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,160
Older sis, what do we do now?

187
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,540
Xiao Cai...oh, wrong, my wife.

188
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,700
Wife, so sorry.

189
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,080
I had a drink with some of my friends earlier

190
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,420
so I came late.

191
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,500
You are not unhappy about it, right?

192
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,090
Clean up your language!

193
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,500
Wife, you wouldn't really be angry about it, right?

194
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,000
Or else... Or else let me, your husband, pamper you.

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,440
Give your husband a kiss.

196
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,560
Don't get near my older sis!

197
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,750
What does me kissing my wife have to do with you?

198
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,190
Could it be that you also want to...

199
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,490
Fine. Come.

200
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,700
Let brother-in-law kiss you.

201
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,150
- Don't come near!<br>- Don't come near!

202
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,310
- Hey, Buddy, wait for a minute.<br>- Don't come near!

203
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,290
Is he that handsome Xiao Dao that you were talking about?

204
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,740
I don't find him that handsome.

205
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,490
But buddy, good thing you are here.

206
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,610
Or else, I don't know for how long I am going to be the scapegoat for this.

207
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,690
Let's talk privately.

208
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,290
It's fine.

209
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,540
You... From where did you, her lover, come from?

210
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,140
You dare to meddle with other people's business here?!

211
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,350
Leave!

212
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,860
Do you have cancer of the eyes?

213
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,840
Let me tell you. I came here before you.

214
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,330
The person that I hate the most are scum like you who bully women.

215
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,580
I have decided to interfere with this matter.

216
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,800
Hey, don't move!

217
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,830
Do you know what this is?

218
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,600
This is a knife.

219
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,360
But in dealing with you, I don't need a knife.

220
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,890
Hero, have mercy! Hero, have mercy...

221
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,910
Hey, it's good that you know to be afraid. Hurry and leave!

222
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,670
Yes. Yes. Yes.

223
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,500
Sorry. There must be some misunderstanding earlier.

224
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Who told you to come in such a bad time?

225
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,080
Then, are you really here to look for someone?

226
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,100
Right. Right. Right. I'm here to look for my good buddy.

227
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,050
He is called Zhan Xiong Fei, called Older Bro Fei.

228
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,810
Let me find it.

229
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,190
Be careful!

230
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,990
You... Just you wait and see!

231
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,140
- Are you alright?<br>- Are you okay?

232
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,360
Wake up!

233
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,200
- Are you alright?<br>- Wake up!

234
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,380
Quickly wake up!

235
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,700
- Wake up!<br>- Hurry and wake up!

236
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:11,290
KoreanDramaX.co

237
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,870
Good! Good!

238
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,550
Customer, please come inside.

239
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,380
Boss. why did you take me to such a place?

240
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,200
If you want my help, then follow my work method.

241
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,330
Don't ask so many questions.

242
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,090
But this place is an indecent place, I don't want to stay here.

243
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,170
Stop being so delicate.

244
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,930
Are your feelings more important or my matter?

245
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,790
Moreover, don't you want to look for those friends of yours?

246
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,420
Of course, I want to.

247
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,810
Then just listen to me.

248
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,250
Stop your nonsense. Just do as I say.

249
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,320
Fine.

250
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,440
Take care.

251
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,510
Yo, Boss Ming Zhen.

252
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,060
Aren't you Boss Ming Zhen?

253
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,780
Are you here to look for our lady boss?

254
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,710
No. Bring me upstairs to drink.

255
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,050
Okay. This way please.

256
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,990
Just walk around and look.

257
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,260
Yo, customer! Are you here to have fun?

258
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,960
Come and enjoy.

259
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,150
So sorry.

260
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,230
I'm waiting for someone. I'm waiting for someone.

261
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,650
Waiting for who?

262
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,460
- That's right. <br>- What do you think about me?

263
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,810
What really do you want?!

264
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,380
Younger Sister, you've stared at me this way for several days.

265
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,690
I really can't continue looking at it anymore.

266
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,820
Today, the captain is here.

267
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,590
You must give me an acceptable answer.

268
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,200
What do you mean?

269
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,970
Servant, change her clothes.

270
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,630
Dream on!

271
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,090
<i>- Get over there!<br>- This one's not bad.</i>

272
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,440
This one's not bad...

273
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,390
Very beautiful. She's quite beautiful. This one's not bad.

274
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,630
Move your dirty hand away!

275
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,470
<i>Quite fierce.</i>

276
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,620
You have quite an attitude.

277
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,820
I like!

278
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,160
Immediately get lost!

279
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay!

280
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,730
Let go of me!

281
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,630
- A Ji Ya!<br>- Let go!

282
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,470
A Ji Ya! Hurry and go!

283
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,670
Where did this stinky brat come from?!

284
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,290
Attack!

285
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,140
You are really something, little girl.

286
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,420
Your little lover even came here.

287
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,370
- I don't know him.<br>- A Ji Ya, what are you saying?!

288
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,370
I am here to save you!

289
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,810
Your love... is just one-sided, right?

290
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,280
Quite interesting.

291
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,790
This little girl looks like she doesn't want to go nor stay.

292
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,960
Fine. It just so happen that we're quite bored right now.

293
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,450
I'll play a game with you.

294
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,450
I have time to play games with you! Just quickly let her go!

295
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,650
No way.

296
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,240
This is a thousand-year-old rule of us pirates.

297
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,040
If you win, you can take her away with you.

298
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,280
But if you lose,

299
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,810
you can't leave this room, either.

300
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,490
Hey, are you Pirate Bay people men of your words?

301
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,980
Of course, we are.

302
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,740
Okay.

303
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,000
- Let's play then!<br>- No...

304
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,540
The rule is very simple.

305
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,750
We will take turns to turn the wheel.

306
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,200
On which bowl it lands, then you drink that bowl.

307
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,110
Whoever stands until the very end, he'll be the winner.

308
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,160
Okay.

309
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,230
Come.

310
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,730
Stop.

311
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,010
Bring out the pirate king.

312
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,510
This can cause a life.

313
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,600
How is that a wine?

314
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,680
<i>It clearly is poison.</i>

315
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,990
<i>No one dares to drink it.</i>

316
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,220
Mr. Captain, he is just a child.

317
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,090
Stop get serious with a child.

318
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,860
Boss, no matter what pirate king is,

319
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,290
I can drink it.

320
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,320
Don't be so arrogant.

321
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,060
Do you know what kind of wine the pirate king is?

322
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,570
Just drinking a mouthful, you can be unconscious for three days as a light effect,

323
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,120
but worst case scenario, you may die immediately.

324
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,510
Bai Ze, don't drink it!

325
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,270
Bai Ze, don't drink it!

326
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:58,770
A Ji Ya, I came here today in order to take you away.

327
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,920
I am not afraid to drink any amount.

328
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,280
Waiter! Bring out your pirate king!

329
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,430
- Okay, coming.<br>- Bring the wine over here!

330
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,520
Okay.

331
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,150
I'll be lenient with you.

332
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,440
I'll go first.

333
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,290
I'll go first!

334
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,530
What good drinking ability!

335
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,260
No! Bai Ze!

336
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,790
Don't drink anymore!

337
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,740
Bai Ze!

338
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,370
Can't take it anymore?

339
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,910
Come!

340
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,020
Brat! There are only two bowls of wine left.

341
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,630
Don't say that I am bullying you.

342
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,600
You choose first.

343
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,820
Okay.

344
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,360
I'll choose that bowl.

345
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,550
<i>♫ If you don’t want to have regrets in your love, ♫</i>

346
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,060
Okay.

347
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,620
But you drink first.

348

Bai Ze, don't drink!

359
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,890
Hurry and drink it!

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,540

I still must save you.

366
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,490

385
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,000
This... What's going on now?

386
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,100
Hey! Who are you?!

387
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,640
How did you get in?

388
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,910
This can't be real, right?

389
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,580
I recognize you.

390
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,710
You are the friend of Her Lady Highness Princess.

391
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,830
What is this place?

392
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,120
This is Princess Zi Su's room.

393
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,110
This is Zi Su's room?

394
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,640
Yes.

395
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,290
Hey, where is Zi Su?

396
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,800
Princess Zi Su has gone missing.

397
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,510
I don't know about the specific details, either.

398
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,500
But the Emperor is already panicking crazily.

399
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,250
Zi Su is missing?

400
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,800
Hurry and go save that girl!

401
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,790
She is in big trouble.

402
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,190
Where is His Majesty?

403
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,380
Ah... he is probably in his chambers.

404
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,240
Hey! Where are you going?!

405
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,840
You're saying that you met a little monster called Babe Ya on that island.

406
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,280
It was he who sent you back here.

407
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

408
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,340
It was also he who told me that Zi Su was in trouble.

409
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,520
What Babe Ya or Babe Mi, so mysterious...

410
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,570
Could it be you escaped midway?

411
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,530
Hey.

412
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,790
Looks like that island indeed has a lot of strange and mysterious things.

413
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,030
Since you are already back,

414
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,640
don't think about what's happening there now.

415
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,500
Yes.

416
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,600
Right now, I just hope that Bai Ze and Yuan Shuai can be blessed by Heaven

417
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,230
to eventually meet up and investigate the truth clearly.

418
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,810
Then the most important thing now is to save Zi Su.

419
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,380
Eunuch Cao, what did that spy say earlier? Say it again.

420
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,400
That spy really dared to ask for such a high price.

421
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,230
Just for some news, he dared to ask 10 pieces of gold bars.

422
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,070
If not because I am worried about Her Lady Highness Princess...

423
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,520
Get to the main point.

424
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,240
He said that he personally saw

425
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,300
Ma Shun abducting Princess Zi Su.

426
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,160
- Ma Shun.<br>- And Ma Shun even got the information from them

427
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,370
that the Magic Star stolen from the Royal Tomb was done by the white-skin people.

428
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,470
What?! The Magic Star also got stolen?

429
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,390
All troublesome matters have happened all together.

430
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,500
The most important thing now is to save Zi Su.

431
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Others are not important.

432
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,260
Since Ding Song and his men are asking about the whereabouts of that Magic Star,

433
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,390
it then means that they are not allies of the white-skin people.

434
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,560
We can't make such conclusions so quickly, either.

435
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,360
It is also possible that they are doing a dog-eat-dog.

436
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,130
I heard that those white-skin people have been living underground for a long time

437
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,070
that's why their skin and pupil color are not the same as ours.

438
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,590
Even if we know that Zi Su was taken there,

439
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,960
but how are we going to find that underground city?

440
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,900
I indeed was able to get information that

441
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,320
there is a Jianghu warrior with a code name called Yu Qi Lin.

442
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,090
He knows how to contact these underground people.

443
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,100
Yu Qi Lin?

444
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,620
His code name is quite refined.

445
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,800
Who can find him?

446
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,430
A person like him usually is hard to track.

447
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,760
I'm useless. I was only able to learn that such a person existed.

448
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,170
As for if he is a man or a woman, I don't even know.

449
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,580
This person is our only hope of finding Zi Su.

450
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,670
No matter where he is, even if he is in a tomb,

451
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,300
we will dig him out regardless.

452
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,160
How about we send out the imperial army to do the search now?

453
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,210
You can't.

454
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,870
Right now, we already know that Zi Su is in Ding Song's hands.

455
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,980
If we increase the scale of our search for Zi Su,

456
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,530
it will surely alarm the enemies.

457
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,380
By that time, if they are pushed to the wall and

458
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,570
do some extreme actions which will harm Zi Su, that's not good.

459
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,730
Zhan Xiong Fei, do you have the confidence of bringing back Zi Su here safely?

460
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,170
As long as I'm not dead, I surely will bring Zi Su back.

461
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:23,360
Okay. I'm entrusting this matter now to you.

462
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,190
You must know, Zi Su is very important to me.

463
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,690
Your Majesty, Zi Su is also very important to me.

464
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:40,030
KoreanDramaX.co

465
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,480
Ding Song! I advise you to just better let me go now.

466
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,940
Go back and admit your mistakes to my older bro.

467
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,630
Maybe I can even put in some good words for you

468
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,830
and let my older bro be merciful and spare your life.

469
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,020
Since time immemorial, the winner becomes the king and the loser becomes the bandit.

470
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,730
Once I get the five Magic Stars, it's still an unknown of who'll sentence who.

471
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,260
You!

472
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,890
You better just be obedient.

473
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,430
I will guarantee your safety.

474
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,820
Don't dare play some tricks.

475
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,830
You won't escape.

476
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,680
Lord!

477
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:31,000
10 miles more in this direction, it will already be the area that you said.

478
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,740
Lord, the person you have an appointment with is called this Yu...

479
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,800
Yu Qi Lin!

480
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,250
Oh, right, right, Yu Qi Lin.

481
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,230
What kind of person is he?

482
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,160
Making things really mysterious and insisting on meeting in the desert.

483
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,630
I heard that this Yu Qi Lin is very mysterious.

484
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,600
No one ever saw his real face.

485
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,040
But that's all not important.

486
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,270
As long as he can tell us how to go to the Yongzhou Underground City, then that's enough.

487
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,740
I really hate people like him;

488
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,100
one covers himself up and is so mysterious

489
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,050
as if he were doing some illegal activities.

490
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,280
A criminal calling for the arrest of another criminal.

491
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,640
So funny!

492
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,370
Do you believe that I'll stuff your mouth?

493
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,600
Come then! My mouth is in my body. I'll say whatever I want!

494
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,800
Can you do anything about it?!

495
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,620
Of course, I--

496
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,690
Jeez, enough already.

497
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,170
What use is it arguing with her?

498
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,360
I heard that this Yu Qi Lin sees money* like its his life<br> (very greedy for money).

499
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,240
The gold in our carriage will surely be able to satisfy him.

500
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,560
Let's hurry and get in the carriage and continue our journey.

501
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,460
Yes, Lord.

502
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,500
- Let's go.<br>- Hurry and move.

503
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,250
Move!

504
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,730
- Hmp!<br>- Lord.

505
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,940
Move. Get in.

506
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,000
I don't want to sleep.

507
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,720
I am not sleeping. I'm drinking!

508
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,730
A Ji Ya!

509
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,670
Xiong Fei!

510
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,570
- Owner, this guy has a weak scholarly look but is quite loyal.<br>- One more.

511
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,260
I can still go save my friends.

512
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,600
There's no more need for you here. You can go now.

513
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,180
Yes.

514
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,830
You clearly can't drink but you still have to force it.

515
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,240
How come people now have become this arrogant?

516
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,160
Where are you?

517
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,310
Are you okay?

518
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,570
Hurry and lie down.

519
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:29,900
A Ji Ya... A Ji Ya...

520
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,340
A Ji Ya, sorry.

521
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,010
Let go!

522
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,740
I am Ming Zhen.

523
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,770
Mother!

524
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,530
I am incapable.

525
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,810
I can't even save my own friends!

526
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,660
Stop hitting yourself!

527
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,520
Mother!

528
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,200
Stop hitting now!

529
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,030
You are drunk. This isn't your fault.

530
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,380
Mother, I miss you so much.

531
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,440
I also miss Father.

532
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,980
Where are you?

533
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,450
It's such a pity that I can't even save my own friends.

534
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,900
Mother...

535
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,440
Mother...

536
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,330
Mother.

537
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,210
Where has time gone to?

538
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,440
<i>Boss! A customer from the capital is looking for you!</i>

539
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,710
Okay. I get it.

540
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:50,080
<i>[Ming Zhen's Tavern]</i>

541
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,230
May I ask what customer wants to eat?

542
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,050
Is there any duck liver?

543
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,650
What kind?

544
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,160
One side fresh, one side cooked.

545
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,140
I don't want one that's too small.

546
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,880
Customer, let's talk privately.

547
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,300
What really is the situation now?

548
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,070
Right now, they found someone with the goods.

549
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,000
Although I already bribed most of them, it still didn't work.

550
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,480
The government is very angry about an official ship being robbed.

551
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,260
Following the source of the items in the market,

552
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,310
and then tracking it further,

553
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,110
I'm afraid...

554
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,510
You are afraid of what?

555
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm afraid that once they trace it to here, this island will be in great danger.

556
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,310
Isn't there any other way?

557
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,920
Right now, the government is already utterly discomfited.

558
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,700
They surely must arrest someone to execute.

559
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,290
What you mean is if I want to protect this small island, I must give out that person?

560
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,840
I already relayed the words.

561
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,050
What to do next will depend on yourself.

562
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,550
Of course.

563
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,000
You worked hard.

564
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,670
I already prepared the room.

565
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,670
You have been exhausted from your travel.

566
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,910
Go rest early.

567
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,130
No more. I still must hurry back.

568
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,860
Auntie!

569
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,840
Auntie! Auntie!

570
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,000
What?!

571
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,010
What did you call me?!

572
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,810
So sorry. I saw it wrong.

573
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,800
I just want to ask how do I reach the Yongzhou Underground City?

574
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,640
You... are a foreigner, right?

575
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,760
Yes.

576
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,970
Why are you going there?

577
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,110
I have a very important matter to do in the underground city.

578
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,550
The underground city isn't a place that one can just enter.

579
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,970
I...

580
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,290
<i>Branded bag?</i>

581
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,720
Fine.

582
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,640
Seeing that you are a foreigner,

583
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,870
I'll take you to a place. Someone there will tell you about it.

584
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,630
- Come with me then.<br>- Hey!

585
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,500
Do you really know? Hey!

586
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,950
Granddaddy Earth, I'm here to visit you again.

587
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,820
This is my offering to you.

588
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,330
This is just a little dilapidated temple.

589
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,450
Don't look at Granddaddy Earth as just being a low level god.

590
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,900
In our place, everyone knows him.

591
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,370
Then... will he know how to get to the underground city?

592
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,190
<i>This young lad, are you the one going to the underground city?</i>

593
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,990
Who is talking?

594
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,300
<i>Don't look anymore.</i>

595
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,890
<i>I am here.</i>

596
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,650
Is Earth... Granddaddy Earth really that magical?

597
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,090
Don't be disrespectful.

598
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,850
You are quite lucky. It's Granddaddy Earth making his presence felt.

599
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,380
Granddaddy Earth, I want to go to the underground city.

600
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,010
But I don't know how to go there.

601
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:24,040
I hope Granddaddy Earth can guide me.

602
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,370
Granddaddy Earth, this one is my friend.

603
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,990
He doesn't know the proper way of showing respect. Don't blame him.

604
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,650
<i>Look at this rotten temple of mine, so dilapidated.</i>

605
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,340
<i>Only this lady comes here to tidy this place and even gives me offerings.</i>

606
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,490
<i>Other than this lady, I won't help anyone else.</i>

607
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,140
Miss, help me put in some good words.

608
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,620
Okay.

609
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,780
Granddaddy Earth, just help him.

610
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,210
He surely will donate a big amount of money to help renovate this temple.

611
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:56,030
Ah... that's right. That's correct!

612
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,920
Granddaddy Earth, as long as you help me,

613
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,290
I'll surely help renovate your temple and donate a lot of money.

614
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,620
Just be benevolent and tell me how to get to the underground city.

615
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,560
<i>Regarding the underground city,</i>

616
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,450
<i>it's so far yet so near.</i>

617
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,410
Huh? What do you mean?

618
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,600
<i>One cannot leak Heaven's information.</i>

619
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,360
Then how about sharing some more with me.

620
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,670
Ascend another story to see a thousand miles.

621
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,700
Granddaddy, I never went to school.

622
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,050
Stop making it difficult for me already.

623
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,160
Just tell me what it means.

624
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,980
Jeez, give some money first.

625
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
Give money?

626
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,300
Gods still need money?

627
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,610
Of course.

628
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,470
When Monk Tang went to the west, he still had to pay money to see Buddha.

629
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,890
But I really don't have any money with me right now.

630
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,680
Don't you have any money inside your wallet?

631
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:50,380
- Jeez, just leave.<br>- It's fine.

632
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,500
Granddaddy Earth, just wait for a while.

633
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,790
I'll go get some money now.

634
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,580
Hey! That's not allowed.

635
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,320
Granddaddy Earth still has to go report back at the Heaven's Palace.

636
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,970
- Just come back tomorrow.<br>- Hey!

637
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,550
Granddaddy Earth, I...

638
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,260
Jeez, just leave.

639
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,500
Then fine.

640
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,990
I'll come back tomorrow then.

641
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,880
Granddaddy Earth, wait for me!

642
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,360
So much fun.

643
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:40,150
Hey! Get up to drink some soup.

644
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,990
Hey! I'm talking to you!

645
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,470
Get up to drink some soup.

646
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,050
I'm talking to you!

647
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,750
Don't leave me...

648
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,120
Hey! Wake up.

649
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,440
I'm talking to you.

650
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,290
- Don't leave me...<br>- Hey!

651
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,760
Don't leave me!

652
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,460
Let go of me! Let go!

653
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,760
- Don't leave me!<br>- What are you doing?!

654
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,730
Don't leave me!

655
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,170
- Don't leave me! <br>- Older sis!

656
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,510
Don't leave me!

657
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,810
- Don't!<br>- Your hands!

658
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,640
Older sis!

659
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,500
- Don't leave me!<br>- Let go!<br>- You are really something!

660
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,480
No...

661
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,560
- You can't hide your fox tail now, right?! <br>- Older Sister...

662
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,050
You can't hide it anymore! You can't hide it anymore!

663
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,590
You can't hide your fox tail now anymore, right?!

664
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,300
What are you doing?! Why are you hitting me?!

665
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,790
Did you connive with Xiao Dao?!

666
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,370
- Who are you two?!<br>- Older sisr!

667
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,790
Older sis, stop hitting.

668
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,010
Older sis, stop hitting him.

669
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,550
I think he has something to say.

670
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,540
Who are you two?! Why are you hitting me?!

671
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,790
I...

672
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,560
Who am I?

673
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,430
What is this place?

674
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,540
How come I am here?

675
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,090
I... How come I ended up here?

676
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,170
Who really am I?

677
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,390
- How come I can't remember anything?<br>- You are pretending to be confused now, is that it?

678
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,330
- Confused, is that it?<br>- Hey, Older sis, Older sis...

679
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,460
Could his brain have gotten damaged from being hit?

680
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,940
I heard from storytellers that people with amnesia are like him.

681
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,730
Did he really lose his memories?

682
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,940
We can even encounter such things, right?

683
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,970
Hey! Let me ask you. Can you still remember what your name is?

684
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,830
I am called...

685
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,780
- You are called Yuan Shuai.<br>- I am called...

686
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,360
Right. Right. I am called Yuan Shuai.

687
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,950
This name is very familiar.

688
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,590
I am called... I am called Yuan Shuai.

689
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,450
Older sis, he doesn't look like he is pretending.

690
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,110
Then let me ask you again.

691
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:39,010
What is the last memory in your brain? Can you still remember it?

692
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,750
It seems like...

693
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,260
Seems like what?

694
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,030
Seems like I can't recall it anymore.

695
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,940
Seems like I can't remember anything anymore.

696
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,520
You were having a nightmare earlier.

697
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,690
Do you still remember the events in your dream?

698
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,420
You were saying earlier... Who were you asking not to abandon you?

699
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,980
Why did you hug me earlier?

700
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,790
I seem to be... seem to be looking for a person.

701
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,160
Yet in the end, I can't find him.

702
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,620
Right. You are indeed looking for--

703
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,600
Looks like, you really have lost your memories.

704
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,820
Then let me tell it to you then.

705
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,420
Look at the clothes you are wearing.

706
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,790
What's wrong with my clothes?

707
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:26,190
You are a waiter in our shop.

708
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,280
I am... a waiter in your shop?

709
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,920
Yes.

710
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,910
The local rascal Xiao Dao around here always comes to harass us.

711
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,650
Earlier, you helped us drive him away.

712
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:47,260
But... he swung a bamboo stick to your heard earlier and caused you to faint.

713
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,400
I even thought that you haf connived with him to do some torturous trick to win our trust.

714
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,530
Looks like, I wrongly blamed you.

715
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,940
But don't worry.

716
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,630
Since you were hurt because of us,

717
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,040
we will surely take care of you.

718
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,720
Oh...

719
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,970
Then... other than losing your memories, are you okay in other aspects?

720
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,800
I'm all fine.

721
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,540
Just a bit dizzy.

722
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,570
Then that's good. Then that's good.

723
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,660
Then rest well.

724
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,820
It's okay to not remember things from before.

725
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,820
We will slowly help you remember them.

726
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,770
Okay. Thank you.

727
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,800
Xiao Mei, let's leave first.

728
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,420
Okay.

729
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,700
Hey, what are your names?

730
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,710
I am called Xiao Mei.

731
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,200
She is my older sis, called Xiao Cai.

732
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,300
Let's go.

733
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,280
How come I can't remember anything?

734
