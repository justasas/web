1
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,273
We can't eat regular food and
have to keep eating instant food...

2
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:20,574
Our health gets all destroyed.

3
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:22,977
If so, had you brought even a small pot
we could've cooked something.

4
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:23,878
Sure I brought one.

5
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:27,581
As we moved the big bag,
it must have fallen out somewhere.

6
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:31,185
A car is coming in.

7
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:35,489
Just when people are eating,
they come sending exhaust fumes out.

8
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:46,400
- You're back?
- Hello.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,501
- You've been eating, I see.
- Yes.

10
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:51,405
I heard the surgery ended well.
Congratulations.

11
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:53,808
That means a lot more now.

12
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:56,510
Please say hello. These are the folks
that I told you about.

13
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,711
- Hello.
- Hello.

14
00:00:57,711 --> 00:00:59,814
Hello.

15
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:04,118
Even in a garage like this,
people can survive, I guess?

16
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:07,521
It is like a cave-dwelling Circean tribe.

17
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:11,625
Why is this ajumma and nuna
staying in the garage?
(Ajumma - Older lady, Nuna - Elder sister or girl)

18
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,728
They have a bit of problem situation.

19
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,730
Let's go in now. We need to be there for dinner.

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,531
Nothing is uncomfortable, right?

21
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:18,632
Well, it is...

22
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:20,735
We're alright.

23
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:23,838
Then, please have your food.

24
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:27,241
What? For me to eat?

25
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:30,344
Thank you.

26
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:37,351
Nuna, you have some too.

27
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:40,054
Whoa! She caught and ate it!

28
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:42,400
- How did you do that?
- Just like that.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,059
- Do it once more.
- Stop it.

30
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:48,562
What are you guys up to, not eating?

31
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:51,866
Mom, this nuna catches cookies
with her mouth and eats!

32
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,269
What are you up to? 
Oh, I am sorry.

33
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:57,371
It's nothing.

34
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:04,278
How can you throw food at people?

35
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:09,784
What are these people, really! 
Is this like a zoo or something?

36
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:12,286
You too, actually. Why do you catch it eat?

37
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:14,288
Are you an ocean seal? Or a monkey?

38
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:15,890
You also took it and ate!

39
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,193
It was with my hands that I took it 
to eat. Like humans do.

40
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,196
The arms are falling...

41
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:23,397
Why did you do it like that?

42
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:24,698
What is this?

43
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:26,700
What did you do wrong to get to this?

44
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,304
Hyeong was throwing cookies at the
people staying in the garage.

45
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:31,806
I was only watching.

46
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:33,207
It was just an accident?

47
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:37,411
Yes. On the night the asteroid came,
there were many falling accidents.

48
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,213
We think your son also had such an accident.

49
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:42,216
Have you fully investigated who was 
at the company at that time?

50
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:47,722
Yes. We did that, but hardly anybody was left
at the company at that midnight hour.

51
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:52,226
What's left are the females. They'd have no
motive to forcefully push your son to his fall.

52
00:02:52,226 --> 00:02:55,429
Physically speaking, there is no chance.

53
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,933
We're closing the case as an accidental fall.

54
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,234
How is it?

55
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:03,938
Just an accident...
I mean, something looks odd, doesn't it?

56
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,539
What does?

57
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:08,342
To think that he fell from being
shocked about the asteroid...

58
00:03:08,342 --> 00:03:12,246
Hearing that the police started investigating,
I thought it would come to something.

59
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:13,647
What's there for it to come to?

60
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:16,450
That day there were so many people
getting shocked and killing themselves.

61
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,953
That fits CEO No's nature?

62
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:28,262
I heard that my grandson did a bit of mischief.

63
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:31,866
If it was unpleasant, I'm really sorry.

64
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:34,568
- No, it's nothing. 
- It's all right.

65
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,472
Is there anything uncomfortable?

66
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:40,474
- That...
- Nothing at all.

67
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:43,277
Then, please take rest.

68
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:49,784
I swear, why is this man always asking if there's
anything uncomfortable? Like he can settle it.

69
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:53,587
What's uncomfortable are way too many.
Why does he keep asking that?

70
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:56,090
Mom...

71
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,292
Omo.

72
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:02,096
- I had something to get from the car.
- I see.

73
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:06,500
If there's anything inconvenient,
please let me know. It is fine to.

74
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,302
It's all right.

75
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:10,104
Then, you know...

76
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:12,506
Can we borrow one small pot?

77
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:13,707
Small pot?

78
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,210
We have a gas stove, but no pot.

79
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,900
If you could lend one small pot
we can cook something to eat.

80
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,317
I see. You should have told me earlier. 
There are so many pots at home.

81
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:26,921
Please wait. I will get it for you right away.

82
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:31,325
Who threw this?

83
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:33,828
Who is it that threw this in the recycle bin?

84
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:35,229
Is it you?

85
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:36,130
Is it you? Is it you?

86
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,431
- No.
- No, it's not me.

87
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:39,133
Then who is it?

88
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:40,134
Is it you?

89
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:41,035
What is?

90
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:42,737
Is it you who threw this in the recycle bin?

91
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:44,638
Why would I throw that?

92
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:46,640
Who was it?

93
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,743
Ajumma, did you throw this?

94
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:49,844
No, I...

95
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:51,445
It was me who asked her to throw it.

96
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:52,446
What did you say?

97
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:53,447
Wait a moment.

98
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:56,250
I asked to throw that. It's too old and tattered.

99
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,753
Too old and tattered? 
Even if it is all tattered,

100
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:00,755
why would you throw it without
checking with me?

101
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:01,756
One moment.

102
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:05,359
You threw it in the multipurpose room, so you
wanted to get rid of it, I thought. What's wrong?

103
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,862
I put it there briefly, as a stain 
was smeared on it.

104
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,764
You don't know how precious
an outfit this is, to me?

105
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:12,366
How would I know about? 
If it's old, I would throw it!

106
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:15,469
Also, a floral design? What's up with that?
Not even suiting your age...

107
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:19,173
What is not suiting? Is there a law against
old people having floral designs?

108
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:21,075
Then you think the polka dots suit you?

109
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:23,477
Bullshit, it suits you!

110
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:25,479
I can't dare throw even trash, I guess.

111
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,680
- Oh, I'm sorry
- What? Trash?

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,782
This is trash, you think?

113
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:29,083
Then this is trash too.

114
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,284
Isn't it well-matching for you?

115
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:32,586
Seriously, why are you like this?

116
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,088
Then you too take your clothes off!

117
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:35,689
I'll take it and throw--

118
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,892
Father, please stop it.

119
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:39,994
These two fight the minute they meet,
just as they meet...

120
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:43,297
Still I'm glad that they can't fight,
as Mother-in-law went inside.

121
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:49,303
<i>The bilateral power-struggle in this house is
due to the strive for hegemony between
Mother-in-law and Grandfather.</i>

122
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:51,705
- How can people talk so irresponsibly?
- Open the door!

123
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:53,107
<i>To use a nation-based metaphor,</i>

124
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:55,309
<i>like America and China, they are 2 superpowers.</i>

125
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:59,713
<i>Unfortunately due to the antagonistic relations,
their disputes are not ending. </i>

126
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:03,317
<i>While a majority of their disputes are
ended on a partitional-basis like now,</i>

127
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:08,222
<i>if affiliated parties join the fray,
it can be major war scenario.</i>

128
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:11,225
<i>Such major wars have broken out
twice in this house.</i>

129
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:14,328
<i>The Great War I and the Great War II.</i>

130
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:17,131
<i>The reason why the Great Wars broke out,</i>

131
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:20,835
<i>was that the family members joined the 2 sides
in the fight, which led to such wars.</i>

132
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:25,239
<i>They ended, but only with some of them
sadly perishing in the battlefield.</i>

133
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:30,344
<i>I personally witnessed one of them,
and I read the annals of the other.</i>

134
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:35,750
<i>As per my mother-in-law diary,
"The Wang Yu Jeong Journal",</i>

135
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,253
<i>Great War I was 38 years ago, in 1975.</i>

136
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:43,758
<i>It broke out when Father-in-law and
Mother-in-law were to get married.</i>

137
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:46,660
<i>The nations going to war were...
Grandfather, Grandmother,</i>

138
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,263
<i>aunt Wang, Mother-in-law's mother,</i>

139
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:51,966
<i>Father-in-law, and Mother-in-law.</i>

140
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,468
<i>The background for the Great War is as follows.</i>

141
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:56,270
<i>Marriage? What marriage?</i>

142
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,572
<i>She is even pregnant, 
then what do we do?</i>

143
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:01,075
<i>Pregnant? What kind of talk is that?</i>

144
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:03,878
<i>How dare some shitty girls' trade school grad
think of coming into our family?</i>

145
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:08,282
<i>That's right, eonni. See how the world is now.
Do they all marry just because of pregnancy?
(Eonni - elder sister)</i>

146
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:10,184
<i>Oh, this makes no sense.</i>

147
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:13,788
<i>That time, Grandfather and aunt Wang
opposed the marriage.</i>

148
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:17,291
<i>Though only a country girls' trade school grad,
Mother-in-law was very bright.</i>

149
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:22,196
<i>Sensitive and vulnerable as Father-in-law was,
Mother-in-law was already in firm control.</i>

150
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:24,398
<i>The reason why I went to trade school
is not business success,</i>

151
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:27,701
<i>but was family plight, is what
you should say very clearly.</i>

152
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:31,806
<i>Father, the reason why she went to 
trade school was not business success,</i>

153
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:33,607
<i>but family plight.</i>

154
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,009
<i>Really?</i>

155
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,412
<i>On one phrase from Grandfather,
the war broke out.</i>

156
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,014
<i>Forget it, forget it.</i>

157
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:43,617
<i>No need to talk. In our family, I won't have any
marriage to a shitty girls' trade school grad.</i>

158
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,820
<i>- Father!
- Husband...</i>

159
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:49,824
<i>Shitty trade school for girls?</i>

160
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:54,428
<i>As for the war, once neighboring countries joined,
the scope expanded.</i>

161
00:07:54,428 --> 00:07:56,931
<i>Who said my daughter went to
a shitty trade school for girls?</i>

162
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:58,432
<i>It was I who said that,
so what? What?</i>

163
00:07:58,432 --> 00:08:00,534
<i>Who said it's a shitty trade school?</i>

164
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:02,036
<i>If it's a shitty school, it's a shitty school.</i>

165
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:05,039
<i>What's the great education do you have?
How great was the school you went to?</i>

166
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,440
<i>I am a Seoul school graduate.</i>

167
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,942
<i>How great was that school, I want to know...</i>

168
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:13,047
<i>What is this commotion about? 
What are you up to?</i>

169
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,549
<i>- Don't do it like this.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

170
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:17,752
<i>Ah, really...</i>

171
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:21,255
<i>Grandfather and aunt Wang formed
the allied front against the wedding.</i>

172
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:23,156
<i>Father-in-law and mother-in-law.</i>

173
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:26,761
<i>Between Grandmother and the joint force with
Mother-in-law's mother, intense war erupted,</i>

174
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,863
<i>that continued for 6 months.</i>

175
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:31,565
<i>Though eventually the wedding was conducted,</i>

176
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:34,268
<i>a cold war continued for 2 years,</i>

177
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:36,570
<i>and Grandmother passed away.</i>

178
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,973
<i>While the official cause
was pancreatic cancer,</i>

179
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:42,076
<i>there is considerable opinion that
it was due to war-induced stress.</i>

180
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:45,079
<i>It was a tragedy left behind by Great War I.</i>

181
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:55,189
You bought pork?

182
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:57,591
Hurry, put it in. Hurry.

183
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:04,198
In one week since coming here,
for the first time we're eating hot food.

184
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:05,499
That's right.

185
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:08,202
If we only had a small pot
we could've eaten things like this.

186
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:10,204
Wasn't it good that I asked?

187
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:12,807
Brat, you better know that
I can do good things.

188
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,408
Really, look at you showing off.

189
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:16,710
Who was it that caused this all--

190
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,613
I guess not. This is a good day,
so let us not fight.

191
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:22,116
Yes. When it's a good day like this,

192
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:26,821
let us really focus on eating kimchi soup.

193
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:31,125
May be because it's a rich house.
Even the pot looks so tasteful.

194
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:34,028
It seems it's not made domestically.

195
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:36,731
Where did the Italian cast-mental pot
that was here, go?

196
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,232
I'm sure it was there earlier.

197
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:41,035
If it was there earlier, how could it
just walk out and disappear?

198
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:42,036
What are you looking for there?

199
00:09:42,036 --> 00:09:45,439
The Italian cast-metal pot. I want it for pork stew
but however much I search, it isn't there.

200
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:48,142
Dad had gone out earlier with
something just like a pot.

201
00:09:48,142 --> 00:09:50,244
Did you go out, taking a pot with you?

202
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:52,146
Wh... what... well...

203
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:55,049
Why? Where did you go with that?

204
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:57,451
Oh... To that... garage.

205
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,652
Why the garage?

206
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:00,755
You know what kind of pot that is?

207
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:04,558
Nothing... To cook something, they
wanted to borrow it for some time.

208
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:08,062
You crazy? It's an Italian cast-metal pot
that even I hardly use.

209
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:10,364
Go get it back right away!

210
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:11,766
Tomorrow, I'll go--

211
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,067
Tomorrow? What tomorrow?

212
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:16,570
It has an enamel coating. If it's used
without a clue, the coating will come off!

213
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,773
You won't get it back right away?

214
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:30,885
In all-time history, Gil Seon Ja's kimchi soup 
today seems like the very best.

215
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:31,986
Really?

216
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:35,489
With some pork, we can eat just this.
Hurry, get some rice.

217
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,494
I want to eat in such hurry, my hand shakes!
Isn't it crazy?

218
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:41,896
Excuse me.

219
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:44,298
Where's the pot that I gave earlier?

220
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:45,499
It's here.

221
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:47,401
Thanks to you, we're making stew.

222
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,803
One moment.

223
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:53,407
I'm sorry. Saying it is an Italian cast-metal pot,
my wife is flying off the handle.

224
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:54,608
What do I do about this?

225
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,811
Is that so? Then what to do?

226
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:59,513
We'll eat right now, wash it,
and send it back with you.

227
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:02,216
I am really sorry, but it can't wait at all.

228
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:04,318
Right away now itself, 
I'll have to take it back.

229
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:08,422
Right now itself? It's enough if just
the pork is done. It'll be very quick.

230
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:12,727
I'm really sorry. Let us pour this somewhere else. 
Yikes, it's hot.

231
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,328
Here, napkins.

232
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:16,630
Then please pour here.

233
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:20,434
Really... Really sorry about this.

234
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:24,538
It's enough if just the pork is done. 
It'll be done quickly.

235
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:29,443
I'm really sorry too.
Let me lend you another pot later.

236
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:36,350
Every day he would ask 
if there is any discomfort.

237
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,253
But he won't even wait till
the pork gets cooked?

238
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:44,158
I want to take the Italian cast-metal pot and
hit that fellow on his head, seriously!

239
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:48,562
I want to take this cast-metal pot and
hit you on your head, seriously.

240
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:50,264
I got it back, you know!

241
00:11:50,264 --> 00:11:52,566
Try this stunt ever again and see!

242
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:56,170
What's wrong?

243
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,372
What?

244
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:04,078
<i>Following the regional war of the afternoon,
the tensions continued through the evening.</i>

245
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,182
<i>If this continues, couldn't a 3rd Great War erupt?
I worried.</i>

246
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:11,685
<i>That is because wars always break out
due to trivial matters.</i>

247
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:14,789
<i>It was the same with Great War II.</i>

248
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:17,291
<i>Great War II broke out 6 years ago.</i>

249
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,493
<i>The nations at war included...
Grandfather,</i>

250
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:20,694
<i>Father-in-law,</i>

251
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:21,996
<i>Mother-in-law,</i>

252
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:23,297
<i>Brother-in-law,</i>

253
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:24,698
<i>Sister-in-law,</i>

254
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:26,000
<i>my wife,</i>

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,501
<i>Gyu Yeong,</i>

256
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:30,004
<i>and aunt Wang.</i>

257
00:12:30,004 --> 00:12:33,207
<i>This was war that I also experienced.</i>

258
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:42,316
<i>Cheol Min scratching Gyu Ho's face
sounded the sirens of Great War II.</i>

259
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:45,419
<i>Gyu Yeong, take this thing and
get rid of it somewhere.</i>

260
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:49,623
See what the son of a bitch did
to this perfectly good cup--

261
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:57,631
It was a dog brought in by Grandfather that 
Mother-in-law asked Gyu Yeong to get rid of.

262
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:02,336
Gyu Yeong brought the dog back to the house,

263
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:06,340
and that dog promptly scratched
Gyu Ho who was hardly 2 years old.

264
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,344
<i>While that forms the background
of the expansion of the war,</i>

265
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:15,149
<i>the real reason was the resentment that had
developed among the family members.</i>

266
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,151
<i>Is it a boy that you would ask
to get rid of a dog?</i>

267
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:18,652
<i>Is he stupid not to do it?</i>

268
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:21,455
<i>You think a boy would throw away a dog?
Gyu Ho nearly lost an eye!</i>

269
00:13:21,455 --> 00:13:22,356
<i>Yeah... That's kinda true.</i>

270
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:23,858
<i>Why were you throwing my dog
just as you like?</i>

271
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:26,160
<i>- That dog broke a cup..
- Mom, I am not done with you!</i>

272
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,662
<i>- Playing with cups is normal? 
- You know how much that cup was worth?</i>

273
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:30,464
<i>You brat, all day long you bother the dog.</i>

274
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:33,167
<i>Why do you hit me?
In 2 years I will be 60!</i>

275
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,668
<i>Grandfather, what are you doing?</i>

276
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:35,669
<i>What is this you are trying?</i>

277
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,371
<i>How can you do that with Grandfather?</i>

278
00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:41,876
<i>- Is it Gyu Yeong that you'd ask to throw a dog? 
- I never never asked him to bring it back.
It was he who brought it back.</i>

279
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:45,179
<i>Aren't you tired of seeing
that dog all day long?</i>

280
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:52,686
<i>The war was truly intense.</i>

281
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:56,090
<i>The war that extended to 2 weeks,
had the house regimented in trenches.</i>

282
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,994
<i>The public sentiment was divided into the allied
forces and the united front, in a jittery state.</i>

283
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:00,694
<i>Then it happened.</i>

284
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:01,796
<i>Oppa.</i>

285
00:14:01,796 --> 00:14:05,699
<i>Look at your plight! Doesn't a daughter-in-law
even give you some hot food to eat?</i>

286
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:09,003
<i>You are the culprit here! You are.</i>

287
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:11,205
<i>Aunt, why are you poking your nose
into my family matters?</i>

288
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:13,507
<i>Say what?</i>

289
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:16,310
<i>You asked for it!</i>

290
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,613
<i>Aunt Wang would soon leave this world.</i>

291
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:22,216
<i>While the official cause was high blood pressure,</i>

292
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:28,122
<i>in the final analysis, it was war-induced anger,
a tragedy left behind by Great War II.</i>

293
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:32,727
What?

294
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,528
How far did you go?

295
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:36,831
I'm almost at the restroom. Why?

296
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:38,933
I am dying to pee!

297
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:41,535
What can I do about it?
I asked you to come with me.

298
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,038
Even to wash dishes, I have to go away.

299
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,439
Come even now, you want to?

300
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,842
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

301
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:49,944
Hello.

302
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:52,446
Is it 010434267?

303
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:53,848
CEO sir?

304
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:55,850
Yes.

305
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,351
Have you been well?

306
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,954
Yes. How about you, CEO sir?

307
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:05,059
Do you want to buy ice cream and come over?

308
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,660
I am by myself now.

309
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,164
I can't. They won't let anybody in there.

310
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:13,968
Once you return home, I will buy you
a lot of ice cream.

311
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:16,670
That means... you should recover quickly,
so you can come home.

312
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,774
Yes, I understand.

313
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,675
Shall we try cajoling Na Jin A?

314
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:23,277
That school grad intern?

315
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:24,278
Why?

316
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:26,981
She is staying at CEO No's family's garage.

317
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:28,582
Then it should work.

318
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:29,884
That girl?

319
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:31,986
But she always seemed like trouble, to me.

320
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:34,588
That too, as she was CEO No's pick,
he was always guarding her, right?

321
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:38,092
Moving into the garage with nowhere to go, was
because the Adviser offered her shelter, as well.

322
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:39,794
Well, that's true.

323
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:42,997
If I say I was once close to her dad,
it is possible to fool her, however.

324
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:44,498
Isn't that dangerous?

325
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:48,702
If she joins our side and screws it up,
it's us who'll be finished.

326
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:52,506
Isn't there a way to cleanly
fool her into doing it?

327
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,110
How about making use of a pretty boy?

328
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,812
Pretty boy? Who?

329
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,413
Hell it's not you, is it?

330
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:03,717
I am in no mood for jokes now,
so if it's you, you are a dead man!

331
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:06,420
Seeing him all tongue-tied,
it seems he did mean himself.

332
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,322
You blockhead, seriously!

333
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,825
Tell me then. You meant yourself, really?

334
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,826
No.

335
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:13,828
Then, who?

336
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:15,629
Won Bin.

337
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,531
Do you know Won Bin?

338
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:19,133
You know him well enough to ask?

339
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:20,434
It is not like that.

340
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:21,936
How about just requesting him, I felt...

341
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:23,637
You twerp... seriously!

342
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:24,538
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:25,639
Hey, you better stop right there!

344
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,941
Sorry.

345
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,044
What happened?

346
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:31,946
The shrimp hit him, it seems.

347
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:34,048
What's it? What happened with him?

348
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,650
He did get hit... by the shrimp.

349
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:39,653
This nitwit of no use...

350
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:42,656
After dinner, do you eat Chaga mushrooms
every day?

351
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:45,459
They say it has good anti-cancer effects.

352
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,661
From now on it is really important.

353
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:50,865
For me, this is a fork on the road
leading to life or death, really.

354
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:52,265
Is it that serious?

355
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:55,069
Of course. The way I think now,

356
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,773
if it can cure cancer, I could cook and eat
even the paper you blew your nose into.

357
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:02,777
This twerp even talks weird stuff now.

358
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:05,379
Isn't it just a metaphor for my feeling of urgency?
What's wrong?

359
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:10,384
Father, you just carry on taking care of
Cheol Min, who's most precious to you.

360
00:17:12,586 --> 00:17:18,993
=Hello everybody. Asteroid 2013QR3 seems to=
=be maintaining a 31 000 kilometer distance,=

361
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:21,195
=and rotating around the earth.=

362
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:24,298
=As estimating planetary calendars=
=is impossible due to the asteroid,=

363
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:29,603
=lately the weather bureau has been almost=
=unable to predict high and low tides times.=

364
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:33,407
=Thus incidents with people caught in=
=tidal mudflats, have increased a lot.=

365
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:37,011
=As the tides come and go as it likes,=

366
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:44,018
=if you work in mudflats and feel a high tide,=
=it is best to escape to the seaside quickly.=

367
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:52,126
=While you escape, rather than run like this,=
=if you can run like this, it will help you=
=run at least a little bit faster.=

368
00:17:52,126 --> 00:17:54,628
=This was Today's Asteroid Update.=

369
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:56,530
They must be crazy. This is all news?

370
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,631
You can say that.

371
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,134
This messed up world feels a bit odd--

372
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:06,240
What are you trying to do, now?

373
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:14,048
Just now, weren't you seeing to your business?

374
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:19,253
We said you can't step into the garden,
how can you do your business here?

375
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:20,855
It was the lesser business.

376
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:23,858
Lesser business or bigger business,
we had an agreement!

377
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:27,261
If you don't keep it, 
what about how my situation will be?

378
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:30,064
For the pot incident, I'm really sorry!

379
00:18:30,064 --> 00:18:32,767
But you did go too far here.

380
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:36,971
If you say it like that, then 
you really go too far too.

381
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:37,972
Huh?

382
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:42,576
I really hadn't planned to tell you this but...

383
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:46,280
Honestly, when Jin A's dad was alive,
think how much he contributed to the company.

384
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,482
Think how much he helped you.

385
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:51,185
But, though I'm thankful for you
letting us stay in the garage,

386
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:53,687
is this even letting people live?

387
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,391
In the garage, is there a bathroom,
or is there anything at all?

388
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:03,097
Everyday we have to walk 1 km
to some big store,

389
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:05,699
wash our faces, get our business done,
wash our dishes and come back.

390
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:10,805
To wash clothes, we have to even 
take a bus and go to a laundromat.

391
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:13,107
Is that how it is?

392
00:19:13,107 --> 00:19:15,910
But I had asked you to tell me if there was
anything inconvenient, then why?

393
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,012
Even if I had told you, 
it wouldn't work out, right?

394
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:20,815
Though I thought I would tell you,
I just couldn't tell you.

395
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:21,916
What is this you are...

396
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,619
Excuse me for saying this, but 
it's your wife who decides it all.

397
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:27,221
Not everything, you know...

398
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:29,623
On the bathroom issue also,
isn't it pointless to--

399
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:32,126
Please go pee. Go.

400
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:33,828
Pardon?

401
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:35,629
Please pee in our bathroom, I said.

402
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,331
If your wife knows of it, what to do?

403
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:39,033
It's me who will talk to her.

404
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:40,835
Come inside and please pee.

405
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,036
Su Yeong, why aren't you back?

406
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:44,338
How is Min Hyeok today?

407
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,741
You seem to really like injeolmi.
<i> </i>
(Traditional Korean rice-cakes)

408
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,242
Oh yes. It's way too tasty.
<i> </i>
(Traditional Korean rice-cakes)

409
00:19:48,242 --> 00:19:53,547
Honey. I told Soe Dol's wife here, to use 
our bathroom as she wishes from now.

410
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:54,548
What?

411
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:58,652
Come on. For a bathroom, they have to walk
a kilometer and find one in some big store.

412
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:00,755
Sister-in-law, come in and take care of it. 
It is fine.

413
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:01,756
What is fine?

414
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:04,158
When they were let into the garage, they were
not to step in the garden, so what're you saying?

415
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:05,860
Isn't the bathroom a different matter?

416
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,161
Please go pee. It's all right.

417
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:09,363
I'm sorry. You can't. Please leave.

418
00:20:09,363 --> 00:20:12,366
She just needs the bathroom for a moment.
Even that we cannot allow?

419
00:20:12,366 --> 00:20:14,268
You really won't show a human side?

420
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:17,071
That's right. It's not right to be 
mean to good people.

421
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,973
Go in and pee. Pee as much as you want.

422
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:21,075
What pee? Peeing is not the problem.

423
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:24,278
The problem is other people coming and going
as they please at our house.

424
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:27,281
That's right. As mom said, this is not
an issue of whether she pees or not.

425
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,783
<i>I feel uneasy.</i>

426
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:30,384
<i>There is much division.</i>

427
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:32,386
<i>Finally, are we at the prologue of Great War III?</i>

428
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:34,889
Why are you stepping up?
Are you the house-owner here?

429
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:36,690
What kind of talk is that from you?
Hurting my feelings...

430
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,192
You better stop that.

431
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,494
Go in and pee. Just as you like, pee.

432
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:42,696
You cannot. I'm sorry, but please leave.

433
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:44,498
That's right.

434
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:45,499
Who is she?

435
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:46,700
Damn it!

436
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,303
You are deliberately doing this with me?
All through from daytime?

437
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:50,504
What did I deliberately do?

438
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:52,306
Come on, you're really too much.

439
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:53,607
What's it? Why are they like this?

440
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:56,210
It's about the people from the garage. 
They want to even use our bathroom.

441
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,412
<i>We are on the verge of Great War III.</i>

442
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:02,416
<i>In every Great War, one person's
life has to be lost.</i>

443
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:11,325
The people in this place aren't
even trying to fool anybody...

444
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:15,129
Where did she go?

445
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,032
Mom.

446
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:31,345
Mom!

447
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:37,651
How can you do that to me in front of outsiders?

448
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:39,453
I am the head of the household here!

449
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:42,356
How can you trample on my self-respect?

450
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:44,658
I am the head of the household.

451
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:47,061
Your mom says it can't be done?

452
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:52,666
<i>This can gradually spiral out of control
into a Great War III.</i>

453
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:59,573
Grandmother, a text came in.

454
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:01,876
That is mine. Give it to me.

455
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:05,079
<i>Just at the right time, there comes 
a text for Father-in-law.</i>

456
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,284
<i>That finally was the starting gunshots of
Great War III breaking out.</i>

457
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:13,287
<i>Hey Fatso, here's the phone number
of the Choe Yeong you miss.</i>

458
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:18,392
<i>010-3277. She is in Seoul. 
Try calling her up. haha.</i>

459
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:22,196
Wait a moment! 
What is this?

460
00:22:22,196 --> 00:22:24,498
Choe Yeong's phone number.

461
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,801
<i>Have you heard any news on Choe Yeong?</i>

462
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:30,604
<i>Would you perhaps know her contact details?</i>

463
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:33,607
This is what you've been up to lately?
Asking for Choe Yeong's contact details?

464
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:34,508
No. That...

465
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:36,911
- Dad! What is this about?
- You asked for a woman's phone number?

466
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:40,314
<i>What's wrong? If he recently asked for
somebody's phone number, what's the big deal?</i>

467
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:43,117
Father, You are now
siding with your son? 
That just won't work.

468
00:22:43,117 --> 00:22:46,120
A married man. This is just
my friend doing some joke!

469
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,723
It's the truth. Believe me.

470
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:51,625
My friend is playing a joke.

471
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,227
Hey, what is this you're doing?

472
00:22:53,227 --> 00:22:54,428
<i>It is Great War III.</i>

473
00:22:54,428 --> 00:22:56,630
Let go! Let go!

474
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,333
It is just my friend doing a joke.

475
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,943
Dad has fainted.

476
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:10,644
What's wrong?

477
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:12,947
Dad!

478
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:15,549
<i>A victim will eventually emerge
in Great War III.</i>

479
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:17,651
<i>This time, that was me.</i>

480
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:20,254
Dad, please don't die... Dad!

481
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:22,056
Are you all right?

482
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,057
- Dad.
- Honey!

483
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:25,559
<i>I was a war casualty.</i>

484
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:30,765
<i>For 1 minute 39 seconds.</i>

485
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:39,573
<i>Great War III, with the moniker "Garage Folks'
Toilet Liberation Struggle", was extraordinary.</i>

486
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:41,275
<i>I died but was revived.</i>

487
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:44,478
<i>Father-in-law was kicked out in the dead of night
wearing a sleeveless running shirt.</i>

488
00:23:44,478 --> 00:23:47,581
Go out right now! I hate 
even seeing your mug.

489
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,783
Honey...

490
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:50,584
It's a misunderstanding. It is.

491
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:55,489
I only casually asked. That bastard Horsehead
made a big deal of nothing, honey!

492
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:18,712
Sister-in-law.

493
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:21,215
Jin A.

494
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:27,321
Asleep? Sorry.

495
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:30,024
Just for a bit... open the door.

496
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:35,529
Please come in.

497
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:37,832
Mom. Mom.

498
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:39,934
What? Why?

499
00:24:43,838 --> 00:24:46,340
What's wrong, in the middle of the night?

500
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:49,443
Is it okay for me to stay here briefly?

501
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:51,045
What?

502
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:55,049
But why are you in just a running shirt?

503
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,351
I had a bit of a situation.

504
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:59,954
- Is there anything uncomfortabl--
- None. Nothing.

505
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:02,056
There is nothing.

506
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,163
You must be cold. Please come over.

507
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:11,465
Will that be okay?

508
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:14,668
For spoiling your sleep...
I'm really sorry.

509
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:16,470
- Nothing we can do about it. 
- It's all right.

510
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,273
It seems you have nowhere to go.

511
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:22,676
Then, excuse my manners...

512
00:25:22,676 --> 00:25:24,879
This mat feels quite warm.

513
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:34,488
By chance, if anything bothers you,
please let me know... any time.

515
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:41,355
This is a split-up?

516
00:26:41,355 --> 00:26:43,157
How dare this lowlife...

517
00:26:43,157 --> 00:26:45,659
But how did you see that he was the thief?

518
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,661
I can hear the sound of what others are thinking.

519
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:49,363
What bullcrap is that?

520
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:53,167
He must be somewhere here.
What hellhole is he living at?

521
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:56,170
Take the meat out and just give the soup.

522
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,671
How did you know that I eat it like that?

523
00:26:57,671 --> 00:26:59,073
Didn't I tell you,

524
00:26:59,073 --> 00:27:00,875
that I can see what all you're thinking
by just looking at the eyes.

525
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:03,177
As I see it, she has now got another man.

526
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:04,578
I will ask without beating around the bush.

527
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:05,880
You found someone you like?

528
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,781
Yeah.

529
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:08,082
Oh my God!

530
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:11,385
But when I am with you, grandfather,
it feels like I have got a family.

531
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:13,587
Punk.

532
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:15,289
Who are you?

533
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:17,892
Stop playing hard to get,
and properly reject her.

534
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:20,094
It feels like I have no such ideas.

535
00:27:20,094 --> 00:27:22,596
Why are you sitting there instead
of finding shelter somewhere?

536
00:27:22,596 --> 00:27:24,899
Because of the rain I cannot tell you no.

537
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:27,401
Grandpa, are you a fool?
