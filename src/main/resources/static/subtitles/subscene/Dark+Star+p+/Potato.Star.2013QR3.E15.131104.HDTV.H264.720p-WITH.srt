00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,610
<i>Two kinds of sounds exist in this world.</i>

2
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,540
<i>One kind of sound that other people hear.</i>

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,850
<i>One kind of sound that only I hear.</i>

4
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>I want to fart. 
Hold it in?</i>

5
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,720
<i>Nah, let's discharge!</i>

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,590
<i>I was to tell him that we're splitting.
When should I do it?</i>

7
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,260
<i>Whoa! Completely my style.</i>

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,240
<i>My world is... noisier than other peoples'.
It's bloody loud!</i>

9
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,120
Senile old fart. You can't hear my horn?

10
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,090
<i>Two kinds of sounds exist in this world.</i>

11
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,660
<i>One kind that other people do not hear.</i>

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,700
<i>One kind that only I do not hear.</i>

13
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,850
<i>That grandpa looks like he has some cash.</i>

14
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,630
You were going to steal the 
grandfather's wallet?

15
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,840
How about just getting lost?

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
What the heck are you?

17
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,540
"This tall handsome kid might be good at fighting
and it's scary." Isn't that what you are thinking?

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,070


19
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,540


20
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,640
What?

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,950
You're right. I can do some Taekwondo.
Shall I show you?

22
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,720
What's this? You stinking gangster thug...

23
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,760
Are you all right?

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,860
Thank you.

25
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,430
If you weren't there, it would've been big trouble.

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,460
But, how did you see that he was
about to steal my wallet?

27
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,930
You must have good eyes.

28
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,400
It wasn't seeing it. I heard him thinking.

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,970
Heard his thoughts?

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,210
This was always a secret, but 
I will tell just you, grandfather.

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,880
I am able to hear what 
other people are thinking.

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,350
What?

33
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,820
<i>What kind of bullcrap is that?</i>

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,020
<i>Isn't he a crazy guy?</i>

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,850
I'm not crazy.

36
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,890
<i>Huh? What's this? He really
can read my thoughts?</i>

37
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,090
Yes. I can really read your thoughts.

38
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,500
I'll be damned! Really, live for long
and one would see such things.

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,960
I've lived for almost 100 years.

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,530
Seeing someone like you is a first for me.

41
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,370
Then please take care.

42
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,040
One moment, one moment.
I should give you something...

43
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,870
It wasn't for getting any rewards.

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,440
I just felt like helping guard you, grandpa.

45
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,650
In that case, I am even more grateful.

46
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,580
Oh then... Here.

47
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,050
It's my number, to call.

48
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:22,190
As I have something to do now,
I will treat you to a meal next time.

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,410
<i>What did you do that?</i>

50
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,620
<i>This time you can ask for dry cleaning fee.</i>

51
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,550
<i>Won't I have to compensate you?</i>

52
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,750
=[Kkatalk] with Bullshit Prince=
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i>Got it dry-cleaned well?</i>

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,220
=[Kkatalk] with Bullshit Prince=
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i>What are you doing this weekend?</i>

54
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,960
=[Kkatalk] with Bullshit Prince=
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i>Performing now?</i>

55
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,530
=[Kkatalk] with Bullshit Prince=
<i> </i>
<i>If your fingers aren't broken,
you better give me a call.</i>

56
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,090
What's this? He is not even checking it.

57
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,660
Dead or what?

58
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,330
<i>Su Yeong. By chance, did you die?</i>

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,800
<i>Why aren't you even checking the texts?</i>

60
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,840
<i>If you are alive, for God's sake
at least check it, Su Yeong.</i>

61
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,890
Have this to wash it down.

62
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,820
Is that young lady still incommunicado?

63
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,030
Yes. She isn't even checking the texts.

64
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,060
She may be trying not to hurt you.
Actually I wanted to tell you this...

65
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,270
As I see it, that young lady
has got another man.

66
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,570
That is not so. Su Yeong is just fickle
which I can't... say she is not.

67
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,510
It is just not another man, you know.

68
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,750
It can't be, right? Ajumma?
<i> </i>
(Ajumma - Older lady, aunt)

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,950
What, he can read people's minds?

70
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,780
Of course. I told you it's true.

71
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,980
How does he know others' minds?
Is he psychic?

72
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,190
What psychic? Must be a con-man.

73
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,960
Look at you. I told you my thoughts got pulled
out word for word. He was reading it all.

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,160
What is so hard in that?
I can do that too.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Shall I try reading your thoughts?

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,930
What?

77
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,870
Try to read, try to read,
what I am thinking of.

78
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,910
"As she wants to scold me now, can she possibly
guess my mind?". Isn't that what you thought?

79
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,110
- What?
- So I guessed it right?

80
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,610
Why are you looking like that?

81
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,780
Ah, this ground meat, damn.

82
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,050
What's with you?

83
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,350
Who am I?

84
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,080
What do you mean who?

85
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,550
What? You are Choe Yeong's ex?

86
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,750
Why again say that?
It was all over, I said.

87
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,320
Yes, you should stop. Dad had to suffer through
as much as he possibly could, because of it.

88
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,420
He was really in bad shape.

89
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,260
It's fine, you leave it alone.

90
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,730
I'm somebody who had cancer surgery.

91
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,030
What kind of food is ground meat, 
for one who had cancer surgery?

92
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,230
Ground meat is said to be
most lethal with cancer.

93
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,800
There you go again. When you already eat
all that Chaga mushrooms and blueberries.

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
If I eat those things, that's enough?

95
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,570
You hardly bother about my diet.
I'm cancer-stricken.

96
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,770
The cancer was in such an
early stage, seriously!

97
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,710
Early stage or zero stage, it is cancer.
Cancer!

98
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,280
You are always like nothing at all
has happened, with me.

99
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,850
Why so? What is your reason? 
I do want to know that, really!

100
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,150
Oh, I know, I know. Don't eat it then.
Eat something else, whatever it is.

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,350
Okay, I'll eat it.

102
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,490
But... From now on, you better
take care of me a bit!

103
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,960
Rascal, you're bothersome, really!

104
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,430
Don't be saying that, please.

105
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,200
If Cheol Min had cancer surgery and it's
ground meat here, would you say that?

106
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,870
Why are you staring, all round-eyed, 
you silly whelp?

107
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,810
You have nothing else to do
but ask for trouble?

108
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,010
His eyes were always round,
so what are you going to do?

109
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,310
Sure, sure. Say no more, please. Just don't.

110
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,400
Jong Seok!

111
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,700
It's for me. That friend.

112
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,370
Here I go, to meet him.

113
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,040
Why are you like this 
since a while back?

114
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,240
You have a call you need to wait for?

115
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,450
Nothing like that.

116
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,950
This is all 1, it seems.

117
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,420
Why are you looking at others' texts?

118
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,260
If it's 1, it could be blocked.

119
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,990
What?

120
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,090
Didn't you tell me that?

121
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,660
If the number 1 doesn't go away,
it could be blocked, you said.

122
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,500
Who would block me? 
You think I'm like you, grandfather?

123
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,330
What's there to think?

124
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,430
Didn't you say...

125
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,630
that it's like knocking 100 times at a house
and nobody answering.

126
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,100
It is not so, okay?

127
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,940
Geez.

128
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,510
Come on, let's go.

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,080
This means I'm blocked?

130
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,640
How dare this lowlife...

131
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,420
How are you?

132
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,450
I was anyway going to call you.
Looks like you contacted first.

133
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,290
I just wanted to see you, grandpa.

134
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,760
That's a good thing!

135
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,430
We could've eaten something expensive.
Why did you pick a sundae shop to meet?

137
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,200
Would you like to order?

138
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,500
A sundae soup for me.

139
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,340
I...

140
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,270
Sundae soup without any more meat,
and with just sundae in it.

141
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,840
Okay.

142
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,510
How did you know that I liked to eat that?

143
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,920
Didn't I tell you, that I can look at the eyes
and hear what one is thinking?

144
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,390
Sundae soup is what you like most, right?

145
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,590
I had read that also, the last time.

146
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,790
That's why you asked to come here?

147
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,990
Next time, let's plan to go eat some meat.

148
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,460
I will buy you something good.

149
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,930
It's all right.

150
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,860
But grandpa, don't you feel odd about
me reading other people's thoughts?

151
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,070
Most people get scared like I'm some monster.

152
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,530
Monster?

153
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,740
It's strange, yes, but not scary.

154
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,880
It's because they don't know. Isn't there 
so much in this world that feels strange
only because we don't understand it?

155
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,250
You can't be coming in here.

156
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,460
It's that... there's someone I need to find.

157
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,920
That guitarist... Where is he?

158
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,660
Who?

159
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,060
- That worn-out... and dark-looking... that..
- Worn-out and dark-looking?

160
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,160
Jang Yul seems to be who she's talking of.

161
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,630
Oh, Jang Yul?

162
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,730
He quit.

163
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,470
He quit?

164
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,570
Why?

165
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,670
Who knows?

166
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,140
Ah, whatever...

167
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,440
He himself said it.
Our shades of music don't match or whatever.

168
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,640
That fellow, what bloody shade is that?

169
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,210
We have the shade of shit and 
he has a shade of gold?

170
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,310
What's this, what's this, come on...

171
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,620
What's with you? 
You think I am that guy?

172
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,490
Where is that guy's place?

173
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,680
It should be somewhere here...

174
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,610
Which corner rat-hole is he living in?

175
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,340
~ <i>I am in love with you, hey why not, 
for real, in love with you.</i> ~

176
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,150
~ <i>I am in love with you, hey why not, 
just like this, I can confess.</i> ~

177
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,350
This doesn't work.

178
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,550
This is supposed to be a song?

179
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,290
Look here.

180
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,430
~ <i>I am in love with you, hey why not, 
for real, in love with you.</i> ~

181
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,830
~ <i>..not, extremely, in love with you.</i> ~

182
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,030
~ <i>..not, like dying, in love with you.</i> ~

183
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,600
Look here, Jang Yul.

184
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,370
Ah, that shocked me.

185
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,210
Even your shock comes slow, it seems.

186
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,880
You know me, right?
Have a chat with me.

187
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:11,260
<i>This sucks baldy. My feet hurt like I'll die but
even the seats for the elderly are all taken.</i>

188
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,330
What are you doing?

189
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,900
That gentleman is getting off at the next stop.

190
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,470
Is that so?

191
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,870
What did you want to say?

192
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,340
Why do you ignore my texts?

193
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,810
I did not ignore...

194
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,740
What are you saying? I was always checking.

195
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,410
Got dry cleaning done.

196
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:12,550
There is no weekend performance.
Why must we get in touch?

197
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,860
What kind of response is that,
combined over so many days?

198
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,530
I am not one who beats around the bush.

199
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,730
Honestly you are not even my type.

200
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,930
Your looks are kinda meh...

201
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,770
Your style is all worn-out.

202
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,700
I even know that you have no interest in me.

203
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,270
As an impoverished musician,
you are inconsequential at present.

204
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,570
You'll only be more inconsequential
in the future. I know all that.

205
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,410
Are you even hearing what I am saying?

206
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,880
Yes.

207
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,810
If you are hearing, make at least 
a sound in response... Seriously!

208
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,650
Let me continue.

209
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,480
You're so leisurely in your response
that it bugs me.

210
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,160
You won't see the texts properly.
You won't take a call properly.

211
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,930
So, if we start dating, that will be a horror incident
the vision of which already flashes into my eyes.

212
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,500
But I still have a feeling of curiosity.

213
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,070
Not a good feeling, but a curious feeling.

214
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,740
So I would say...

215
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,670
Let us date.

216
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,340
That was too short.

217
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,810
Didn't you hear it?

218
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,280
Let's date, I said.

219
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,110
I saw it a little while back.

220
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,210
What?

221
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,050
The texts.

222
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,350
I saw it a little while back,
and replied right away.

223
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,920
I responded to what I heard too.

224
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,390
But why?

225
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,430
What kind of a 'why'...
When I said we should date, what's this 'why'?

226
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,100
Just like that. Why should we 
do that, I wondered.

227
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,300
You hardly interest me.

228
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,600
I said I know that you aren't interested in me.

229
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,700
Anyway, make a decision quickly.

230
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,640
Will you date or will you not?

231
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,050
You take your own sweet time, so 
a reply takes a few days, I guess.

232
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,880
Don't forget, and reply.

233
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,590
You must reply, okay?

234
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,160
If I don't get a quick reply, I will be
so curious, I won't even get sleep.

235
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,990
I won't be able to do anything all day long.

236
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,930
Understood?

237
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,130
He is so slow.

238
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,170
I will be waiting. Understand?

239
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,980
I said it was fine not to escort me,
but you still came all the way.

240
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,810
It is a dangerous world, you know.

241
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,650
Grandpa, you are a precious person for me.

242
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,770
Me?

243
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,040
Yes.

244
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,050
I got separated from my family
when I was young.

245
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,620
All this while I was living alone.

246
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,460
But when I am with you, grandpa,

247
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,030
It feels like I have got a family again.

248
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,860
Wouldn't that mean you're precious?

249
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,060
You punk.

250
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,300
<i>This street light is still not fixed?</i>

251
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,210
Now you can go.

252
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,410
Till you've left, I won't be going in.

253
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,620
Yes.

254
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,490
Hey, look at this silly whelp.

255
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,430
I turn around, and you're back up on the sofa?

256
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,000
You are the leaseholder of this sofa?

257
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,870
You whelp. You seem to
ignore it that I'm here.

258
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,170
You are a dog. You think
dogs can ignore people?

259
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,940
You... Father may be a little fond of you,
but stop showing off to me, seriously.

260
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,980
How long do you think you can
just monopolize Father's love?

261
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,280
You feel love is eternal?

262
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,690
You plan to keep bullying Cheol Min?

263
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,890
What bullying? I was just 
goofing around with him.

264
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,560
Oh my... Cheol Min. 
Were you doing all right?

265
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,760
Why is the street light in front 
of the house still not fixed?

266
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,230
Give them a call tomorrow.

267
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,740
Yeah, what's it?

268
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,940
What?

269
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,380
That rascal...

270
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,820
Thank you.

271
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,230
Yes. Take care.

272
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,240
<i>The bad street light seem to be fixed.</i>

273
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
<i>Who did this nice thing?</i>

274
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,540
It was me.

275
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,010
What?

276
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,840
No. Nothing.

277
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,150
<i>What's this? This guy looks a bit strange.</i>

278
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,610
<i>Good-looking, though.</i>

279
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,350
<i>Does he live around here?</i>

280
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,920
No. Way over around there.

281
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,850
What's the deal with him?

282
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,330
Ah, that scared me.

283
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,430
I thought a car was coming in.

284
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,640
The street lamp was kaput, but you 
didn't even come and pick me up?

285
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,210
Even otherwise, I was about to change
and come to pick you up, silly girl.

286
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,780
But why are you standing here
if you were changing clothes?

287
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,550
As you read it, I will go dry the clothes.

288
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,580
CEO sir?

289
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,050
Ms. Na Jin A.

290
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,890
Yes. Are you doing well?

291
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,460
You must be by yourself, to have called me.

292
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,030
Yes. There is something I'm curious of.

293
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,760
What is it?

294
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,430
By chance...
"Tarzan has 10 Wons worth of underpants on him"

295
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,730
"20-Wons worth is the sword he 
wields as he sings songs".

296
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,200
Do you know this song?

297
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,670
What?

298
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,510
Yes, I do know that.

299
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,970
That's good to hear.

300
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,740
Mom is not taking the call, so there was 
nobody but you to ask, Ms. Na Jin A.

301
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,150
By chance... if Tarzan is wearing 
underpants worth 90 Wons,

302
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,350
do you know how much his
word should be worth?

303
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:49,490
If it's after 90 Wons, 
shouldn't it be 100 Wons?

304
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,690
100... 100 Wons...

305
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,200
Then, "Tarzan..."
How will that work?

306
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,770
"Tarzan has 90 Wons worth of underpants on him"

307
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,340
"Hundred Wons worth is..."
Oh, it's just "hundred".

308
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,170
We can't say "Ten 10 Wons".

309
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,470
It is "1 hundred Wons". 
We drop the "1" and just say "hundred".

310
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,510
"100 Wons worth is the sword he 
wields as he sings songs. Ah Oh Ah..."

311
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,980
I can see that.

312
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,080
Thank you.

313
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,920
I may call you again.

314
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,490
Sure. Go back to rest.

315
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,050
Oh... Good Lord...

316
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,160
What call was that?

317
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,620
What kind of call is it, with Tarzan songs and all?

318
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,830
Better not to know.

319
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,840
<i>You must reply, okay?</i>

320
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,410
<i>If I don't get a quick reply, I will be
so curious, I won't even get sleep.</i>

321
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,240
<i>I won't be able to do anything all day long.</i>

322
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,080
<i>Understood?</i>

323
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,910
Oh, loca! 
I've gone crazy.

324
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,430
Completely a hanging ending, wasn't it?

325
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,580
What? Can't sleep and can't do anything, I said?

326
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,420
This hurts my pride.

327
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,620
What to do, what to do?

328
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,760
<i>Su Yeong, I'm in front of your house.</i>

329
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,060
<i>Let's meet briefly. 
I have something to ask.</i>

330
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,810
I will ask you straight-fart-word...

331
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,270
It's not "fart-word". 
"Forward".

332
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,380
"Straight-forward."

333
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,310
If so, then I will ask like that.

334
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,510
Su Yeong,

335
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,080
By chance have you found somebody you like?

336
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,920
Yeah.

337
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,490
Sorry.

338
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,690
Oh my God!

339
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,530
Don't tell me I have to eat through this.

340
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,360
It's not "eat through", but "get through".

341
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,300
Heck, "eat" or "get",
is it what's important?

342
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,330
That means, because of that guy,
you are splitting up with me?

343
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,800
It's not like that.

344
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,640
My mind has already changed from before.

345
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,470
Didn't I talk to you about all that?

346
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,980
If I like another person,
it has nothing to do with you.

347
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,120
That person also likes you a lot, Su Yeong?

348
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
- No.
- No?

349
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,890
He said he has no interest in me.

350
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,990
Then why?

351
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,560
I have interest in him, so I don't care.

352
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:08,230
I'm sorry. Really.

353
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,900
Su Yeong.

354
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,840
The ajummas at the sauna house said this.

355
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,770
For women, rather than men they like,

356
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,810
it's men who like seeing them
who make them happier.

357
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,580
I can make you happy, Su Yeong.

358
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,660
I brought some appetizer dishes with me.

359
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,860
- How is Min Hyeok?
- Whoa Whoa...

360
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,260
Why are you again going "whoa whoa"?
Didn't I tell you not to do that?

361
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,300
Mom. Somebody Grandfather knows, is able to
look into people's eyes and read their thoughts.

362
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,030
What do you mean?

363
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,340
He met some strange guy recently and
is all excited. It's about that fellow.

364
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,170
Grandfather is dating again?

365
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,470
Dating a guy wouldn't match him,
but this feels just like dating.

366
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,940
They talk on the phone everyday.

367
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,510
Some days back he was like this
from the 2nd floor window...

368
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,180
"Take care. Dream of me!"
That's how they two were parting.

369
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,280
Really?

370
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,750
"Take care, dream of me" was what he said?

371
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,590
I wonder if "dream of me" was said...

372
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,420
But anyway, the feel of it was just like that.

373
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,620
They both were terribly mushy-mushy.

374
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,090
What's this? What gives?

375
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,030
Cheol Min, you whelp.
You are also finished.

376
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,330
Father now likes somebody
more than you. You get it?

377
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,530
You were all acting high and mighty
from getting Father's love.

378
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,470
Serves you right, you silly whelp.

379
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,460
Don't just take painkillers. 
Just go to a dentist.

380
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,020
Careful. You'll get hurt.

381
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,110
Son of a bitch.

382
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,680
Not even calling, in the end.

383
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,080
Hello.

384
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,550
=What are you doing?=

385
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,650
What do you mean what?

386
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,590
=What are you doing in the evening? 
We're going clubbing. You want to go?=

387
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,890
What's in it? Forget it.

388
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:21,460
No no. Let's go, let's go.
Where are you going?

389
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,880
And then?
What?

390
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,450
This is really funny.

391
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,950
Let's stop talking on the phone.
Let's meet and chat.

392
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,150
Coffee would be fine with me too.

393
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,990
Fine.

394
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,460
That cafe?

395
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,290
Now?

396
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,960
What time in the evening?

397
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,530
I got it.

398
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,890
What the hell are you? Get lost!

399
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,920
<i>So I would say...</i>

400
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,490
<i>Let us date.</i>

401
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,160
<i>Just like that. Why should we 
do that, I wondered.</i>

402
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,360
<i>You hardly interest me.</i>

403
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,190
<i>You must reply, okay?</i>

404
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,760
<i>If I don't get a quick reply, I will be
so curious, I won't even get sleep.</i>

405
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,600
<i>I won't be able to do anything all day long.</i>

406
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,430
<i>Understood?</i>

407
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,840
Fine, that's it. I too won't date now.
It's finished.

408
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,480
<i>~ I am in love with you, hey why not, 
for real, in love with you. ~</i>

409
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,720
~ <i>..for real, in love with you, hey?</i> ~

410
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:39,470
Even after sending so much blood into the head,
the lyrics are just not happening...

411
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,520
<i>Hey, son of a bitch! This can flat-out 
shock you when I tell you this.</i>

412
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,630
<i>May be this won't be pleasant to hear.</i>

413
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,730
<i>If you ask why,</i>

414
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,190
<i>I live like it's no big deal. </i>

415
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,490
Nothing special that bothers me.

416
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,890
I live like it's no big deal.

417
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,300
There are no worries to speak of.

418
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:33,790
Flat out...
Flat out shocking you...
...shocking you... will be what I tell...

419
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,460
Go wake up father-in-law. 
Ask him to have dinner soon.

420
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,290
Is he still saying he won't get up?

421
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,600
Then what was the use in taking
2 painkiller tablets?

422
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,530
Well, he says the toothache is really bad.

423
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,670
Father. Please have dinner.

424
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,710
It's already past 9 o'clock. 
Have dinner quickly.

425
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,910
9 o'clock?

426
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,950
Jong Seok! I had promised to meet Jong Seok.

427
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,520
Why did you promise to meet him again?

428
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,090
What is that guy, for you to keep going--

429
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,220
He goes to meet that guy and even 
kicks you on the way out!

430
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,530
Your good times are all a 
thing of the past, you see!

431
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,630
Now you are also like me, like

432
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,300
Nakdong river's ducks that nobody cares for!

433
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,320
Why are you here, getting drenched?
You should have gone inside.

434
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,520
Wasn't it here that we said we'd meet?

435
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,190
You weren't taking the calls, and
because of rain I couldn't come over either.

436
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,970
I don't know what I should do with you.

437
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,000
If you catch a cold or something,
what will we do?

438
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,470
You haven't eaten dinner, right?

439
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,940
Let's go to eat some food.

440
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,880
Though it's late, let's go eat some meat.

441
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,980
It's all right.

442
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,080
We will just eat some Sundae.

443
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,280
We'll eat meat today.

444
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,850
Hadn't I said that I would buy you
some tasty meat?

445
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,680
Let's get up.

446
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,260
Grandpa, are you a fool?

447
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,930
Even with the toothache, 
buying me food is the issue for you?

448
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,140
How can you do this?

449
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,340
This rascal...

450
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,840
What is that? What are they doing?

451
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,050
What is that grandpa up to?
With some boy?

452
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,550
Must be a Grandpa Over Flowers.

Who are you?

456
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,710
Have a brief chat with me.

457
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,690
What you want to tell me, is...?

458
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,620
You know Su Yeong, right?

459
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,090
Suyeom?

(Suyeom - Beard)

460
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,390
Not Su Yeom. Su Yeong.
No Su Yeong.

461
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,700
Yeah.

462
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,430
But why?

463
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,370
I am someone who loves Su Yeong.

464
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,610
But Su Yeong... says it's you she likes.

465
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,750
But I heard you don't even
have an interest in Su Yeong.

466
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,150
You definitely won't be able to date Su Yeong.

467
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,350
Su Yeong's temperament is so impatient.

468
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,020
She's a woman who changes the order
from the menu 5 times at a restaurant.

469
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,860
You both definitely don't match.

470
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,690
Don't play hard to get.

471
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,900
Cut-and-dried... reject her that way.

472
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,670
You have nothing to say?

473
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,970
Whatever it is, just say it out.

474
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,540
Forget it.

475
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,680
In any case, I will leave, 
assuming that you will do so.

476
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,020
It feels like you can't leave assuming that.

477
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,490
What?

478
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,320
I'm also getting it.

479
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,420
Getting what?

480
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,890
Interest.

481
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,360
In that woman.

482
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,300
You said you had no interest!

483
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,860
I'm getting it.

484
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,170
Some 3 hours ago onwards.

485
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,200
Dating, it is.

486
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,700
- Grandpa!
- Jong Seok!

487
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,270
You're back from the dentist's?

488
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,110
It's all perfect now.

489
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,140
Shall we go eat some meat today?

490
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,810
He is the Cheol Min you've been raising?

491
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:05,950
Mmm.. He is. He's always following me,
so I thought I'd bring him along today.

492
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,160
Cheol Min, glad to meet you.

493
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,620
<i>So it's you?</i>

494
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,190
<i>This so-called Jong Seok fellow?</i>

495
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,390
What's it?

496
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,600
May be you read dog-minds too?

497
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,900
<i>I must say I'll bite you.</i>

498
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,470
<i>I'll bite those who have heard of you too.</i>

499
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,770
<i>I'll bite them all, bar none.</i>

500
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,710
It's nothing.

501
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,810
I need a toilet trip.

502
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,280
Watch Cheol Min just for a bit.

503
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,110
Yes. Go ahead.

504
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,680
<i>You dog-shit-smelling punk.</i>

505
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,250
<i>I was waiting for this day.</i>

506
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:45,230
<i>In all of this... I was not the cause.
You are the one starting it!</i>

507
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,430
Hey, what's with you?

508
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,470
Wait there. You can't. You can't bite.

509
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,500
You can't bite!

510
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,200


511
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,300

<i>Because of that guy you talked about?</i>

514
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,740
<i>That fellow has completely fooled grandfather.</i>

515
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,940
<i>I can no longer let it go. That punk.</i>

516
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,150
<i>When you see him, just bite his ding dong.</i>

517
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,720

00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,650
Wait a moment!

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,160
If I am within a 1 km radius,

522

Near U will start flashing right then.

523
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,610

Jun Hyeok never come.

525
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,690
Who is Jun Hyeok?

526
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,790
Jun Hyeok, am I right?

527
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,920
I don't really know.

528
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,880
Even feeling pain comes slow to you?

529
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,050
She found some other man in the end?

530
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,780
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

531
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,390

It's grown like this?

537
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,720
You are the lost son of this family?
