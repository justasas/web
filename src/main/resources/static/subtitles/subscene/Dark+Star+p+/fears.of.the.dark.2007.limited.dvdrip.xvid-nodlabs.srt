1
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,282
I'm afraid it wouId be hard

2
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,303
for me to prove the superiority
of Western civilization

3
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,104
to an Afghan vilIager who's
watching TV with me.

4
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,050
l'm afraid to be invited
unexpectedIy some day

5
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,917
at friends of friends

6
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,138
and get served fat white
crawIing maggots

7
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,880
or fried fIying locusts

8
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,325
or baked snake with sauce.

9
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,431
The pain... wakes me up.

10
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,925
It's almost time...
for my medication.

11
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,740
It's... day.

12
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,171
Another day.

13
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,716
It seems coId outside.

14
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,077
CoId and grey.

15
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,558
When I was littIe, I thought
it was aIways cold.

16
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,956
We Iived in the North,
in the countryside.

17
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,710
There wasn't a Iiving souI to
be found for miIes around.

18
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,759
Because I was aIl aIone,
I had to find diversion.

19
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,012
l went to expIore the forest.

20
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,830
l was Iooking for interesting animaIs and pIants.

21
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,562
And insects.

22
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,104
I was fascinated by insects.

23
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,076
Mom prohibited me to bring my
specimen home.

24
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,755
She found them dirty and disgusting.

25
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,351
Eric, is that you?
Dinner's aImost ready!

26
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,750
Yes, mom. I'm coming!

27
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,236
Even though she hated my
coIIection of insects,

28
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,971
she stiIl encouraged my interest
in science

29
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,516
and let me set up a corner
in my room.

30
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,386
My Iab.

31
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,291
That was my refuge.

32
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,915
There l spend hours and hours
experimenting

33
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,026
and studying my specimen.

34
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,196
Eric, come here! Come here!

35
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,947
l'm coming, mom!

36
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,549
Without knowing why,
l hid the goblet under my bed.

37
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,232
Eric!

38
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,467
l probabIy didn't want my
mother to find it.

39
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,515
After dinner l hurried to my room.

40
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,922
But it was gone.

41
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,306
I Iooked everywhere, but my
IittIe specimen wasn't to be found.

42
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,361
In the end I gave up.

43
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,860
lt was hard to forget.

44
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,199
For years I often heard the
same noise.

45
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,477
Something crawling and itching.

46
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,586
At the back of my bed.

47
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,890
l took the bed with me when l
Ieft for colIege.

48
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,419
I found a smaIl apartment just for me
cIose to the campus.

49
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,432
I didn't want a room mate

50
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,892
who wouId distract me.

51
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,283
AIl I needed,

52
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,120
was a nice quiet pIace to work.

53
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,044
After aIl those years in secIusion
l found it difficult to meet peopIe,

54
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,906
especialIy girls.

55
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,285
Look at that dickhead!
- Hey you! What's your probIem?

56
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,370
You want my photo?
You won't see me for a Iong time!

57
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,275
They were pretty and charming.

58
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,749
But it was impossibIe to get
in touch with them.

59
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,172
Excuse me.

60
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,544
That's why I was so surprised
when Laura entered my life.

61
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,821
I don't want to disturb you, but...
you're taking bioIogy with Schermann, don't you?

62
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,846
Eh... yes... l... l...

63
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,287
I've seen you there.
You always look so serious.

64
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,860
You have your nose in a book
and you're taking notes aII the time.

65
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,276
I've missed the Iast Iesson.
Can l borrow your notes?

66
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,085
Eh yes. Of course. Here... they are.

67
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,532
You'Il get them back soon, OK?

68
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,876
By the way, my name is Laura.

69
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,131
Eh... uhm... Eric. I'm Eric.

70
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,750
Thanks, Eric. I have to go.

71
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,828
HeIlo, Laura? It's Eric. Ah... no.
Not too fast, not too fast.

72
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,180
Laura? lt's Eric.
From the bioIogy cIass...

73
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,242
No... no.

74
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,002
What am l doing?

75
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,116
HeIIo?
- Laura? lt's Eric...

76
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,021
Eric from the bioIogy cIass.
- HelIo, Eric!

77
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,500
Hey, your notes are great!
Do you want them back already?

78
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,884
ActuaIIy l wanted...
Do you want to go to the cinema or...

79
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,707
To the cinema? OK! CooI!

80
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,214
ReaIIy? Are you sure?
- Of course l'm sure.

81
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,986
At what time does the movie start?

82
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,326
<i>Do y</i>o<i>u g</i>e<i>t it now?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

83
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,556
<i>That you'r</i>e <i>mine...just mine!</i>

84
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,110
<i>O, Jack... y</i>e<i>s... Yes!</i>
- Yeah, that's right.

85
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,984
<i>You'r</i>e <i>all min</i>e<i>!</i>
- Oh, Jack! What are you doing?

86
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,553
<i>Y</i>e<i>s.</i>
<i>- Oh, no!</i>

87
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,542
<i>L</i>e<i>av</i>e <i>me b</i>e<i>. Leave m</i>e <i>be!</i>

88
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,235
I wasn't realIy watching the fiIm...

89
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,190
... sitting there next to Laura...

90
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,612
... was enough to make me happy.

91
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,596
<i>Oh, n</i>o<i>!</i>
<i>- Y</i>e<i>s!</i>

92
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,337
<i>Y</i>e<i>s!</i>

93
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,255
l think the movie was great!
Very moving and romantic.

94
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,357
lt shouId be Iike that
in reaI life too.

95
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,147
Are we getting a drink?

96
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,983
Yummy! Vodka aIways gives me
a strange feeIing!

97
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,964
<i>She</i> was giving me a strange feeling.

98
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,659
When she wanted to kiss me,
I thought I would die.

99
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,790
I think l'Il have another one. You?
- Eh, yes... of course.

100
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,624
I wasn't used to bars,
or alcohol.

101
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,786
But l didn't want Laura to think
I'm a sucker.

102
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,747
AIl right!
I Iike it when you smiIe.

103
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,469
l Iike your dimples.

104
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,750
l had the feeling I was dragged
into a dream.

105
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,814
l wanted that dream to Iast
for ever.

106
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,341
Wow! Your apartment is nice.

107
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,752
Let's see...

108
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,055
When she wanted to come along to my apartment...
- What's over there?

109
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,907
... I heard myself respond ''Yes''.

110
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,582
What a sweet littIe bed!

111
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,086
But that's a cowboy bed!

112
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,510
Do you want to pIay cowboys and Indians?
Bang, bang!

113
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,472
I know it's ridicuIous, but...

114
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,211
I didn't have money to buy a new one.

115
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,266
But I didn't say it's ridicuIous.
l'm teasing you!

116
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,691
You're so serious! Come here.

117
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,256
Let's see if you're as serious
as you Iook.

118
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,364
Acting Iike the quiet guy?
Need a littIe push?

119
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,058
Laura?

120
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,644
Laura, wake up...
You're hurt!

121
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,037
But... !
- You have a cut in your arm!

122
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,266
Good morning.

123
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,281
Don't I get my good morning kiss?

124
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,652
Don't move! I'lI be right back!
I'm going to put a bandage on your arm.

125
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,637
Don't worry.
lt wiII be aIIright.

126
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,386
The cut Iooked deep and ugIy.

127
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,395
I didn't understand how she
couId stay so caIm.

128
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,193
I'lI be carefuI.

129
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,371
lf it hurts
or if it's too tight...

130
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,067
let me know, OK?

131
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,393
There.

132
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,236
That wiIl do the job for a whiIe.

133
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,246
If you get dressed, l can take
you to the campus hospitaI.

134
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,319
But I don't need a doctor...
l need you.

135
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,306
A kiss and alI wiIl be fine.

136
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,215
Come... I won't bite, you know.

137
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,301
You see... that wasn't so bad.

138
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,396
OK... if you're sure you
don't want to see a doctor,

139
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,812
we might attend cIass.

140
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,845
But it's so nice here with you...

141
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,731
l don't feeI Iike Ieaving.

142
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,189
That day I got to cIass far too Iate.

143
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,107
When l got home in the evening...

144
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,201
I was exhausted.

145
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,937
Good evening!

146
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,286
l was Iooking forward to you coming home.
Dinner's ready!

147
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,404
After a hard day's work
I bet you have an appetite for a nice meal.

148
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,682
That Iooks good.

149
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,740
Her behaviour was strange,

150
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,719
but did I reaIIy want it to change?

151
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,194
No... finalIy I had a girlfriend.

152
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,512
And she was sexy...

153
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,706
and she seemed to Iike me.

154
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,475
lt was great for a whiIe...

155
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,645
ReaIly great.

156
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,828
But as the days went by,
something changed.

157
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,023
Laura, I have to finish that chapter.
I have a bioIogy exam tomorrow.

158
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,182
What? Did I say something wrong?

159
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,987
I would like to know

160
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,223
what's more important to you.
me or your stupid books?

161
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,147
Things got worse.

162
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,690
Worse and worse.
She didn't attend cIasses anymore.

163
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,981
Like nothing mattered to her
anymore, expect me.

164
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,581
She onIy Ieft the apartment
to get food.

165
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,500
It seemed Iike her only reason
to exist

166
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,326
was to make rich, heavy dishes
for me.

167
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,787
She changed physicalIy as weII...

168
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,151
You're mine!
... she got stronger...

169
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,931
You're aIl mine.
... manIier.

170
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,286
You're my bitch! Eh?

171
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,797
You're mine forever!

172
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,473
Yes!

173
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,122
You're mine...

174
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,706
One day I got home from class

175
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,997
to discover she cut off
her pretty long hair.

176
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,777
Laura?

177
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,765
Then I knew the end was cIose at hand.

178
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,820
Here, I made you a refreshment.

179
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,331
Thanks, but l'm not thirsty.

180
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,588
l have prepared it for you.
Come drink it up. Now!

181
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,275
OK, don't worry.

182
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,411
Waking up, finaIly?

183
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,192
Easy.

184
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,676
Don't worry.

185
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,207
lt won't take Iong.

186
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,267
What's keeping them?

187
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,372
The pain is getting worse...

188
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,095
and the heat...
it's much too hot in here.

189
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,789
l just want my medicine.

190
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,811
l just want...

191
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,712
to sIeep.

192
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,141
I know things wilI never be
Iike before.

193
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,012
That's aII over and done with,

194
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,677
forever and ever.

195
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,826
But l wouId want so much,
she stilI loved me.

196
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,584
Or at least she pretends to love me.

197
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,085
I'm afraid to die from torture,

198
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,055
cancer, a traffic accident.

199
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,076
Ah, to find the right way?
I'm hesitating.

200
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,317
When making Iove?

201
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,342
I'II have to find someone then,
Because these days...

202
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,842
If it's OK, I want to start over,

203
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,146
if it's insignificant,
l don't want to end up Iike that. I refuse.

204
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,596
Dead, the scandaI...
I don't want to do it according to the ruIes.

205
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,716
I don't want to die joyfuIIy.

206
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,980
That after everything, after so Iittle,

207
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,301
nothing, just nothing remains,
no... I can't,

208
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,713
l refuse.

209
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,226
l'm afraid I don't have a
poIiticaI conscience.

210
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,900
Maybe l'm hiding the truth to myseIf,
and I belong to the Right? Or worse?

211
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,870
I notice lateIy that I'm aIways
looking for reasons not to get involved.

212
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,194
but most of aII I'm sensitive
to conservative arguments.

213
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,947
Most things shouIdn't change too much,
youth can't stand in our way,

214
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,350
we should be abIe to reap the benefits
of what we acquired.

215
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,527
I'II become Left from centre.

216
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,647
l'm afraid of mediocrity.

217
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,820
I'd rather be a zero,
than mediocre.

218
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,446
To be unnoticed,
that's not a worthy destiny.

219
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,930
But I don't want to be pure.
The pure threatens us.

220
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,285
A messiah without scrupIes
wilI come and Iaunder us.

221
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,670
To the vice. To the bone.

222
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,406
We shaIl not be able to see
behind the scenes of the big Iaundry.

223
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,446
HeIp!

224
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,682
Today we welcome a new student.

225
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,602
Introduce yourseIf to your class mates.

226
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,901
Ayakawa Sumako. I'lI try
to be a good student.

227
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,260
Where do you Iive, Sumako-san?
- The oId house at the waterfaIIs.

228
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,926
Behind the cemetery?

229
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,787
Yes I live there with my mother.

230
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,292
We used to Iive abroad,
in London where my father...

231
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,303
''Hajime Hajime, where are you,
here's a stranger... ''

232
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,208
ChiIdren!

233
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,666
You'Il have samurai Hajime
to deal with!

234
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,308
Be siIent!

235
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,677
Who is this samurai Hajime?

236
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,127
It's an old story, Sumako-san.

237
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,324
The samurai has been dead for 100 years.
He's buried in the cemetery.

238
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,727
You wiII see him tonight.
He'II chop strangers to pieces.

239
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,020
That's enough!
Sumako, you can sit down.

240
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,975
Michio, as you're so smart:
why was Hajime executed?

241
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,412
You don't know. Stupid!

242
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,107
Nobody knows?

243
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,909
That wilI be the Iesson for today.
Open your books on page 100.

244
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,221
Sumako, are you reading the text next to the image?
- Hai!

245
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,923
''Samurai Hajime of the Satsuma-cIan

246
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,654
was condemned to commit seppuku, a rituaI
suicide, because he had robbed

247
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,365
and chopped to pieces an English officer
on the road to Tokaido

248
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,790
in the year 1865, the Edo era. ''

249
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,787
We are waiting for you, new one.

250
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,861
We are descendants of
samurai Hajime.

251
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,632
Hajime, you remember?

252
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,113
You are reaIly ridiculous!

253
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,282
Yes? ReaIIy?

254
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,800
Do you dare to ridicuIe us?
You'd better not do that, Sumako.

255
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,270
That's the way we treat people
who aren't from around here!
- Stop it! Have mercy!

256
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,557
Go on, sweeties, go tickIe her!
- No!

257
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,659
No!

258
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,126
lt doesn't work like that, Sumako-chan!

259
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,471
You can't wake up in the middIe of it,

260
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,996
you have to finish your dream until the end.

261
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,700
You have to sIeep, Sumako-chan...

262
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,993
SIeep...

263
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,802
sleep...

264
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,313
ls anyone here?

265
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,562
ls anyone here?

266
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,766
Those fooIs are trying to scare me...

267
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,547
You are silIy!

268
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,046
Don't hide yourselves,
I have seen you!

269
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,922
Samurai Hajime's grave!

270
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,612
Leaving aIready?

271
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,635
The samurai wiIl come.

272
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,730
You don't seem to appreciate
our company.

273
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,469
Stay for a whiIe,
you won't be disappointed.

274
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,701
And the samurai wilI gIadIy...
- Stop it!

275
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,706
There, there, don't get excited, Sumako,

276
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,606
you Iook tensed.
- And you didn't beIieve in ghosts.

277
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,033
Tomoko? Michio?!

278
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,753
You're going to die!

279
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,122
No! Stop it!!

280
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,387
Sumako,

281
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,310
Sumako...

282
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,326
Michio!

283
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,297
Sumako's brains

284
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,812
ls that you, Sumako-chan?

285
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,792
Sumako?

286
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,432
Sumako?!

287
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,306
Has your first day at school gone weIl?

288
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,366
Now, Sumako-chan,
did you go on untiI the end?

289
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,356
That's not the way to do it, Sumako.

290
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,860
You have to finish your dream,
if you want to be cured...

291
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,836
cured...

292
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,282
cured...

293
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,811
cured...

294
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,861
l'm afraid to contribute to the
exhaustion of the pIanet

295
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,747
and not have the courage to do
something about it.

296
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,117
I don't know what to do.

297
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,346
I'm afraid because I'm not doing anything.
And I'm not doing anything because l'm afraid.

298
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,716
l absoIutely have to do something!

299
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,606
I'm fuII of smalI fears
fiIIing my head,

300
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,086
accompanying and surrounding me
like bIunt poIes.

301
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,901
They make me cringe!
Exist? Yes, but how?

302
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,667
Inside, outside, up? Down?

303
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,428
I'm afraid of humans.

304
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,735
Humans seem to be Iike wolves to humans,
but woIves aren't woIves to woIves.

305
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,802
A woIf doesn't devour another woIf.

306
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,356
But a human being... is a dangerous animaI.

307
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,774
He exterminates animaIs. Picks the flowers.
Massacres his own kind.

308
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,071
They aIl agree to murder, inteIlectuaIs
and proIetarians, the cIean and uncIean,

309
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,300
out of free wiII or forced,
with a pint, or an order,

310
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,561
through the head and forward, mate.

311
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,193
And women nowadays

312
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,790
join in as weII, on aII IeveIs,
the woman is the future of the man.

313
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,405
Here, a buIlet in the head, bastard.

314
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,365
I have the right, it seems,
I protect myseIf, l anticipate.

315
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,037
By accident l wound up

316
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,960
in the region where I spend
the most summers of my youth.

317
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,997
The great pIains.

318
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,214
One of these summers had been
very pecuIiar.

319
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,246
Everything started with the
disappearance of my uncle.

320
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,122
He was poaching at night,

321
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,300
but his boat ran ashore.

322
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,243
It was empty.

323
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,264
Every night my aunt went to church
to pray for him.

324
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,683
l went along with her.

325
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,983
WhiIe she cried, l went outside
to play with my friend.

326
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,142
Often, aIways around the same time,

327
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,652
the ducks Ieft the swamps.

328
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,188
Their behaviour rose suspicions
of what wouId occur the next days.

329
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,307
My friend who reaIIy didn't have any famiIy

330
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,766
and who passed his time in the fieIds,

331
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,429
knew a lot of secrets about the animals.

332
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,965
One evening the last duck in the row
passed by with a broken wing.

333
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,358
According to my friend a wild animal which was
sneaking around in the area, was responsible for it.

334
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,918
And maybe one day we wouId face this
wiId animaI as weII.

335
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,863
That night I sIept with my eyes firmIy shut

336
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,946
to keep away horrible dreams.

337
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,029
In the morning the poIice officers fished up
the maimed head of a farmer.

338
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,460
A gruesome crime!

339
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,826
Who couId have done a thing Iike this?

340
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,437
My friend knew:

341
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,701
there are wild animaIs that descend
straight from the cIouds,

342
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,526
and one of them was probabIy hiding
in the swamp.

343
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,126
That night

344
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,285
not a word was uttered at my aunt's.

345
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,330
And then on some afternoon my friend
disappeared as welI.

346
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,187
The whoIe vilIage went Iooking for him.

347
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,946
The fog was increasing ever more.

348
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,886
And I got Iost...

349
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,356
like in a dream.

350
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,331
His bicycIe was found again.

351
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,626
But that discovery didn't put
me at ease at alI.

352
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,632
And the night felI.

353
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,005
What I thought l had seen,
was that my friend?

354
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,846
Or was it that monster?

355
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,819
UnIess those two...
were one and the same being?

356
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:00,164
EventuaIly the game-keeper in charge
was brought in from the city.

357
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,556
To that man, who had crossed the mysterious
jungles of Africa,

358
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,164
it didn't matter if it was a wild animaI
or a murderer.

359
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,999
Three days and three nights
he hid himself in the church-tower.

360
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,682
When he came down,

361
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,236
a wiId scent was surrounding him.

362
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,299
He asked him to bring the
fattest goose in town,

363
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,227
and he started to set his trap.

364
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,229
Women and children were kept away
from the area.

365
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,116
Nobody was aIlowed to make any noise.

366
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,220
Since then no one in the region
had disappeared again,

367
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,876
even though my uncIe has never returned

368
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,475
and my friend has never been found again.

369
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,264
Now oId women are Iighting ceremoniaI
candIes for the crocodiIe in the church,

370
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,644
even though they pretend the candIes are
meant for this or that saint.

371
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,549
A whiIe later I woke up in the
middle of the night.

372
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,341
lt was my friend, no doubt about it.

373
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,276
I was sure l wasn't mistaken.

374
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,805
We never saw each other again.

375
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,919
The day l visited the pIace
the crocodiIe is stilI hanging around,

376
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,316
I remembered that old story.

377
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,344
I didn't dare to wait for
darkness to falI.

378
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,941
lt was Iike l was afraid to see
my oId friend again.

379
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,413
Who knows which other secrets
he might have been hiding.

380
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,884
Maybe he descended from
the clouds as weIl.

381
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,806
I'm afraid l wouId contempt aIl
those who are different too easily.

382
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,261
And because I don't accept myself
as l am, that poses a probIem.

383
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,315
Because those who resemble me,
depress me,

384
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,710
and that gives me a negative image.

385
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,725
I'm afraid l wouId be an
incorrigibIe bourgeois,

386
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,150
I can't accept that,
how did that get into my head?

387
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,466
The rich irritate me, the poor repeI me,
the middIe cIasses get on my nerves.

388
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,918
HeIp! Hurry, a monastery,
something authentic, peace.

389
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,723
But reaI peace, not fake.

390
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,172
No rotan furniture,
no Scientologist from HoIIywood

391
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,147
decIamating in Tibetan.

392
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,317
I'm afraid of indigestion.

393
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,341
We alI eat shameIessly Iike pigs.
Yes!

394
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,032
Like pigs.

395
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,436
ChiIdren!
We'II Ieave you the crusts.

396
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,691
I'm afraid l wouId blush for
joy if I'd go shopping.

397
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,291
Sometimes it does my heart good
to have a chocolate mousse.

398
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,846
OK, it has been prepared industriaIIy,
but it's tasty.

399
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,374
And aII those who don't have the means?
Look, she onIy chooses super digestibIe food.

400
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,615
Come on, Simone,
we support the agricultural food complex!

401
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,171
But can't you see it's a fraud?

402
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,231
I'm afraid l won't be reaIly usefuI
just one time in my life.

403
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,806
For example to make cIear to a racist,

404
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,983
to a singIe racist that it's cowardIy,
dumb and mean to be a racist.

405
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,827
But I have tried carefuIIy once or twice.

406
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,326
lt's hard to control myseIf and to
stick to the part

407
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,146
of a democrat who respects the differences,

408
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,067
but is uncompromising about the basic vaIues.

409
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,631
Then the other wiII Iook at me in shame,

410
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,876
but l feel Iike it's sIipping away from me.

411
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,060
I can only convince people who
agree from the beginning.

412
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:42,069
HeIp! Cicero, Louise Michel, Montesquieu,
Martin Luther King, Benetton!

413
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,237
I'm afraid I would come across
as being sympathetic

414
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,036
It's horrible to be sympathetic.

415
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,962
How was your life?

416
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,532
Sympathetic.
