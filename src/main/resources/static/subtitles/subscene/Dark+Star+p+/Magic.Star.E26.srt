2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,540
When I was imprisoned by Ding Song, the one who I missed the most was you.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,790
I remember when you first ran into the palace, you were only seven years old.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,400
Yes, I remember.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,600
At that time, Royal Father punished Nanny Tang who had been taking care of me.

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,100
At that time, I liked to feed and rear crows,

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,050
but Royal Father felt that it was unlucky to rear crows in the palace.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,300
He didn't want me to rear them.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,700
I secretly let Nanny Tang rear them in the Imperial Garden.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,800
In the end, they were still discovered by him.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,400
Hence, he kicked Nanny Tang out.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,650
Subsequently, you were angry with Royal Father

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,100
and ran out of the palace alone.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,600
I wonder how Nanny Tang is doing now.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,200
She took care of me since I was young.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
In this palace, other than you and Older Brother Bai Ze,

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,000
she was my closest family member.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Let's not talk about this anymore.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,100
When Royal Father was alive, he was especially strict with us.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,050
He also did that out of good intentions.

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,200
Who told us to be born into a royal family?

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,790
Older bro, if you could be an ordinary man now,

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,600
but you could live happily forever, would you be willing?

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,500
How come you are suddenly asking this?

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
It's nothing, either.

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,400
It's just that I was really happy with Xiong Fei and the others during these times,

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,200
but... there are also a lot of things that I can't understand,

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,400
so I am in a bit of a dilemma.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,110
Alright, Zi Su has grown up.

30
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,100
You have something in your heart now.

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,600
Can you tell your older brother about it?

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,700
I still have to think about it more

33
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,000
if I should tell you about it.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Fine then. Looks like someone will be hurting.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,400
- Who?<br>- Of course, it's Bai Ze.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,300
Why?

37
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,000
Since you were little, you had been following behind your Older Brother Bai Ze.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400
Even saying that you wouldn't marry anyone else but him.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,200
Who would have thought that after going out for quite some time, you already...

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,900
Older bro! What nonsense are you spouting?!

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you think I didn't notice it?

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Earlier, while we were in the Grand Hall, your gaze never left that lad.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,100
When did I?

44
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,610
I won't talk to you now.

45
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,740
I'm going back to my room to sleep.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,100
The sunrise at this place is 1 hour earlier

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,700
than those islands of the same sea level.

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,340
The sunset time is also 1 hour later.

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
There is actually such a thing?

50
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,500
I am guessing that a special item must be present over there

51
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,730
causing the island to be unusual,

52
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,200
not excluding that there might be...

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Magic Star?

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,900
Ikeda, can you be sure of it?

55
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,670
This is only my guess.

56
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,800
I still can't be 100% sure.

57
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,200
I'm leaving it to Lord Ding to decide.

58
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,800
Lord,

59
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,000
although we aren't sure if there's a Magic Star on this island or not,

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
going there to investigate isn't really going to be a bad thing.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
After all, the day of gathering all the Magic Stars is getting closer and closer.

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,100
Lord Ding, what do you think?

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,200
Ikeda, set out tomorrow and go there on my behalf.

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,600
Lord Ding, how about our agreement before?

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,800
Ikeda, what do you mean?

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Unless you think that our Lord will go against his words, right?

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,500
Oh, no, no, no. Of course, he won't.

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,600
Don't worry.

69
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,800
Once the matter is done, I will surely give an order to abolish sea restrictions in the whole country

70
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,500
and open up trading with your people.

71
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,200
Thank you, Lord.

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,300
Then if Lord doesn't have anymore instructions, I will go prepare now.

73
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,360
<i>Why is Zi Su not happy today?</i>

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,780
<i>That's because she has something on her mind now.</i>

75
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,200
<i>How about we take Zi Su out for a stroll?</i>

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,700
<i>Will she be a bit happier?</i>

77
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,200
<i>She probably will.</i>

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,400
<i>Zi Su, Zi Su, let's go out and play.</i>

79
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
<i>Okay? Okay?</i>

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,470
Have you had enough with the wooden puppet acting?

81
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,900
Come out now, you.

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,500
My legs are numb! My legs are numb!

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
Boring.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
How about it?

85
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,900
Zi Su, accompany me for a stroll.

86
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,600
I don't want to go.

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,700
What's really wrong with you?

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,470
There's nothing wrong with me.

89
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,700
If you want to go out, go and look for Yuan Shuai instead.

90
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,200
I told you already, she doesn't want to go.

91
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,800
The reason she doesn't want to go is

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,000
because she is thinking of the person that she likes in her heart.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
I am not. You are making up things!

94
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Hey, don't make up things.

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,600
If you continue saying things like that, I'll tear your mouth.

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,730
I wasn't making up things.

97
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,100
That's what she said.

98
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,500
She already said earlier that the person she is thinking is called...

99
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,000
called 'Don't like to say it.'

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,050
Hey, who is 'Don't like to say it?'

101
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,800
A man or a woman?

102
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,800
Who is 'don't like to say it'?

103
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Hey, you're annoying.

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Who is 'don't like to say it'? Tell me. Tell me.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Who is he? Who is he?

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
<i>Clay dolls! Clay dolls!</i>

107
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,200
Come.

108
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,400
Miss, I have been carving clay for so many years. You are the prettiest that I have done.

109
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,400
- Really?<br>- Yes.

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,900
Of course, it is. Who else is prettier than you?

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,200
- Here.<br>- Thank you.

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
- Does this look good?<br>- Looks so good.

113
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Fellow villagers!

114
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
This is our first time here!

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,830
Those with money, please give us some.

116
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,000
Those without, please just be our audience.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
Come!

118
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Wow! So great!

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,600
Which one do you want?

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
I want that one over there.

121
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,000
- I'm just a bit off.<br>- Try it out again.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Maybe you'll get in on the next try.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,400
What to do?

124
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,100
Miss, try it again. Yehey! You got it!

125
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,800
It's a hit! Thank you, Owner.

126
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,400
You still have one last ring. Which one do you choose?

127
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,800
Got it.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Since you got it, it's yours now, right?

129
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,700
Come with me then.

130
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Everyone, come to take a look. It's real.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
- Let me see.<br>- Hey... What are you doing?

132
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
What are you doing?! Destroying our show?!

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,160
- Hurry and escape!<br>- Hurry!

134
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,200
Hey! Stop! Don't move!

135
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
Move aside! Move aside!

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,400
Don't move! Stop!

137
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't run! Stay right there!

138
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,100
It's so delicious!

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,900
Delicious.

140
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,800
Mr. Ikeda, we'll have to trouble you for the island matter then.

141
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,800
May Lord Ding and Lord Ma just wait for my good news.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,700
- Goodbye.<br>- Goodbye.

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,200
Is this information reliable?

144
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,800
I heard it personally.

145
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay. You have worked hard.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,270
This information you got is very valuable.

147
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,400
Go down to have a good rest.

148
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,700
Yes. Thank you, Your Majesty.

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,200
Your Majesty, what urgent matter did you call us for?

150
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,580
I just received news

151
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,600
that before Ding Song escaped, he has colluded with the Toyo people.

152
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,460
He sent them to the Money Island.

153
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,400
It should be related to the Magic Stars.

154
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,200
Ding Song's claws really have reached so far out.

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,800
Then what does Your Majesty want us to do now?

156
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Counting the days, that Toyo person should have traveled far already.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,800
I ordered you all to immediately chase after that Toyo person.

158
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,490
And also, you all must leave quietly.

159
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,340
Don't let Zi Su know about it.

160
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,160
Or else, she will be crying and insisting to go with you.

161
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,760
Your Majesty, that doesn't seem right.

162
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,340
What's not right about it?

163
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,800
I'm her older brother.

164
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
This is her home.

165
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,600
I letting Zi Su stay home, will that be worse than leaving with you?

166
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,300
Xiong Fei, what His Majesty said is right.

167
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,730
We will then leave now.

168
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,200
We surely will find the truth behind this.

169
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Okay. Then I'm counting on you then.

170
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,100
Yes!

171
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,140
Ha! Ha!

172
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,000
Ha!

173
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,640
We have to catch up with him but none of us know how to drive a boat.

174
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,820
Are we going to swim over there?

175
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,470
Jeez, look at your stupid self. Don't worry.

176
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,070
His Majesty most likely has prepared a huge boat waiting for us already.

177
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,040
When you are on a huge ship, it's the same as standing on ground.

178
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,960
With the sea breeze blowing on you while eating seafood,

179
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,600
isn't that such a happy way of living?

180
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,250
Have you been on the seas?

181
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,470
I only heard it from other people.

182
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,770
Right now, we are quite behind Ding Song's men.

183
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,510
If we can't catch up with them before they get on the ship,

184
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,880
it'd be harder to look for them out in the open seas.

185
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,650
Okay!

186
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,140
Ha! Ha!

187
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,040
Ha!

188
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,490
Ha!

189
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,250
Toyo people.

190
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,440
Hey, is this that Toyo person that Ding Song sent?

191
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,540
Hero, I think this road might have been yours

192
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,950
but you had the wrong people.

193
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,420
Look at us. We look like kids.

194
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,160
That... That we surely don't have any money with us.

195
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,060
You three have been following me all throughout. You must have been exhausted already.

196
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,040
Don't think I don't know.

197
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,180
You are Heaven Strategy Envoys sent out by the Emperor.

198
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,450
I heard that you're also looking for the Magic Stars

199
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,200
relying on a Star Chart which can locate the Magic Stars.

200
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,120
Is it with you? Hurry and hand it over.

201
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,260
Star Chart? We don't have one.

202
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,220
- Search them.<br>- Yes.

203
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,010
Stop touching me now. It's not with me.

204
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,020
It's not with me.

205
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,620
Big Bro, there really isn't one. Just search.

206
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,440
Hey! I already told you!

207
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,990
We don't have any Star Chart with us.

208
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,450
Now, do you believe us?

209
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:20,670
Since we didn't lie to you, either, then let's just...

210
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,770
A great man doesn't dwell with the shortcomings of little men.

211
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,440
Just let us go.

212
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,480
Then does it mean that the Star Chart is really not with you?

213
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,910
That's right. We little kids never lie.

214
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,430
Since it's like that, I won't make it difficult for you anymore.

215
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,280
I'll send you to your death now.

216
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,710
Who is it?

217
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,950
Hey, hurry and escape!

218
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,480
Let's go.

219
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,900
Chase after them!

220
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,500
Hurry! Hurry!

221
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,260
Hurting others with hidden arrows, what kind of brave hero are you?!

222
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,030
If you have the guts, come out!

223
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,870
How come there is not even one boat here by the seaside?

224
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,950
Hey, Mister. Are there any boats going out into the sea?

225
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,570
"I've been in a gorgeous outfit riding on a mighty horse since young."

226
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,210
Ha? What did you say?

227
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,960
"The weeds grow so high that it covers horse's hoof completely."

228
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,310
My fellow buddies, just come with me.

229
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,420
Hey... What's going on?

230
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,670
You don't understand, right?

231
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,590
That is our Heaven Strategy Envoys' secret password.

232
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,370
- Let's hurry and go.<br>- Oh...

233
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,770
This is the boat prepared for you.

234
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,610
Please depart.

235
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,730
- Thank you, this Big Bro.<br>- Thank you.<br>- You're welcome.

236
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,180
This boat was prepared for us by His Majesty.

237
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,260
What a big boat!

238
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,060
How come I don't find it big?

239
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,990
- Oh?<br>- Let's go.

240
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,950
- Let's go.<br>- Okay.

241
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,010
- Wow!<br>- Bai Ze, let me teach you how to maneuver a boat.

242
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,510
Hey! So rowing a boat is this tiring?!

243
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,750
You were just starting.

244
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,950
Try hard to lose some weight.

245
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,480
I don't know how she is doing now.

246
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,550
Are you are still thinking of A Ji Ya?

247
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,990
She must be hating us so much now.

248
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,470
She never wants to see us again.

249
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,140
Does this matter really have no room for reconciliation?

250
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,810
The hatred of stealing one's wife, the grudge of killing one's father,

251
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,420
if all this hatred and grudges were really so easily resolved,

252
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,020
how come there are still many stories about love, hate, affection, and revenge in all ages?

253
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,160
Bai Ze, think about it.

254
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,890
If you realized that your friends' fathers' hands

255
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,130
were all covered with your family's blood, what would you think?

256
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,860
Bai Ze, did you ever think about this? Our fathers are Heavenly Strategy Envoys.

257
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,820
How could they did such a thing?

258
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,080
What do you mean by that?

259
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,230
A Ji Ya's father, King Salin, is a subject of the empire.

260
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,390
All worked for the empire.

261
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,410
But because of the Magic Stars, he suffered such a tragedy.

262
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,580
Elder Jiong Ye was remorseful of that matter and asked for forgiveness.

263
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,750
What do you really want to say?

264
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,530
From my experience of reading a thousand story books and watching numerous plays,

265
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,320
an expert in official, unofficial, and dynastic histories of heroes,

266
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,230
I feel that the Heaven Strategy Envoys don't seem to be some straightforward and upright heroes.

267
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,550
The hero in your heart is a person who has a clean background and does things with clear regard for right and wrong.

268
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,560
That's why, let's stop suspecting the deeds done by our fathers.

269
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,880
Why not just look at what we should do now?

270
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,030
That is correct.

271
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,790
Yes, you both are right.

272
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,910
Hey! Hey! Hurry and look!

273
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,090
- What's going on?<br>- It's a huge storm!

274
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,040
- Hurry and move the boat forward with full speed.!<br>- Okay.

275
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,680
Royal Brother!

276
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,380
Royal Brother, where did Zhan Xiong Fei, Older Brother Bai Ze, and Yuan Shuai exactly go?

277
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,780
Hey, Eunuch Cao, didn't I ask you to tell Zi Su

278
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,870
about where Bai Ze and the others went?

279
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,530
Oh...

280
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,430
Your Majesty indeed told me to relay that to Princess.

281
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,780
I have forgotten it.

282
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,190
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

283
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,260
Princess, please forgive me.

284
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,990
Look at you. For the matters I told you to do, you just forget them.

285
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,200
Do you still consider me as your superior?

286
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,280
Enough already. Stop acting already.

287
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,180
I am not a 3-year-old kid. Do you think I can't see through that?

288
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,730
Royal Brother, I know that you are thinking about my safety.

289
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,480
You want me to stay here in the Palace,

290
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,410
but I'm no longer that princess in that past, who's always been waited on hand-and-foot.

291
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,670
I am going to look for them. They need me.

292
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,970
Let's clarify that first.

293
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,510
Is it that they need you

294
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,140
or you can't be away from that Zhan Xiong Fei?

295
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,810
Royal Brother, you... I don't care.

296
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,330
Hurry and tell me where they are.

297
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,310
Your Lady Highness Princess, just listen to His Majesty this time.

298
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,950
His Majesty has already too many things to worry about.

299
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,720
Fine. Even if you both won't tell me, I can still find it out.

300
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,100
Hey! Hey! Eunuch Cao, hurry and look for more palace maids and guards to look after Zi Su.

301
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,070
- Don't let her leave the palace.<br>- Yes.

302
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,190
The storm earlier was quite huge.

303
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,310
Good thing, we were lucky. We found this natural harbor to hide.

304
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,750
Or else, there was even a possibility that our boat would have capsized.

305
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,870
I think that this harbor is an abandoned area.

306
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,670
Even if you don't talk, no one will treat you as mute.

307
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,320
What abandoned or not abandoned?

308
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,680
Being able to find a harbor is already good enough.

309
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,210
Talkative.

310
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,380
Hey, Lord, look.

311
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,950
What is that?

312
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,670
Let's go. Let's take a look.

313
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,980
- Yes... <br>- Hurry.

314
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,100
Such huge waves and it didn't drown them.

315
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,150
Really a miracle.

316
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,140
I assume that they dog paddled themselves up.

317
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,590
- Hurry. Take them all away.<br>- Yes.

318
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,430
Hey! You took advantage when we were weak.

319
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,700
What kind of hero is that?!

320
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,660
Little kids... goodbye forever.

321
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,100
I'll be leaving now.

322
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,290
Hey! You... Let us go!

323
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,310
Light the dynamite.

324
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,960
Hey! Don't go!

325
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,930
I still don't want to die.

326
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,420
Yuan Shuai, don't worry.

327
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,990
If there is anyone dying, I'll be the first.

328
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,180
Bai Ze, hurry and think of a way!

329
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,380
No way!

330
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,210
We are Heaven Strategy Envoys. We surely won't die.

331
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,720
There must be a way. We... We...

332
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,060
- Amituofo.<br>- No way!

333
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,990
Heaven! Take good care of A Ji Ya, His Majesty, and Zi Su for me!

334
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,800
A Ji Ya?

335
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,820
How come the dynamite still hasn't exploded?

336
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,400
Telescope.

337
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,530
How come there is a woman over there?

338
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,370
Really?

339
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,930
A Ji Ya, thank you for saving us.

340
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,740
That's right, A Ji Ya. It's really thanks to you this time.

341
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,980
Thank you.

342
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,760
You're really quite stupid. Being caught twice in a day.

343
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,310
So last time, it was also you who saved us, right?

344
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,420
Bai Ze, I think that you being able to survive this time

345
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,720
means you'll be receiving abundant blessings afterwards.

346
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,670
Then... you won't leave anymore after this return, will you?

347
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,470
Hey... Hey...

348
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,690
Where are you going?

349
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,850
What does that have to do with you?

350
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,460
Isn't your matter, my matter?

351
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:56,140

352
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,980
<i>[Ding Residence]</i>

353
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,270
What are you looking at?

354
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,480
You cannot stay long here.

355
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,830
May I ask Mr. Officer, what really happened to the Ding Residence?

356
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,250
That old criminal Ding deceived his superior, deluded his subordinates and had evil plots.

357
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,710
He has become a wanted criminal.

358
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,450
Why are you asking about these? Hurry and leave!

359
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,100
Or else, we will treat you as his accomplice and catch you.

360
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,620
Thanks then.

361
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,080
Qian Yi Shou!

362
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,020
Ma Shun?

363
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,990
Why are you here?

364
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,590
To tell you the truth, Lord Ding has fallen in dire straits.

365
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,730
The Ding Residence has been sealed up.

366
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,690
Okay. Then it's good that you are here.

367
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,430
Return that chest of Lord Ding's deposit money back to him.

368
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,140
What do you mean by that Hero Qian?

369
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,190
Lord Ding has just fallen into difficulty.

370
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,900
Are you severing all your ties with him?

371
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,590
I don't mean it that way.

372
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,860
It's just that it's already been quite long and I still haven't done any of the tasks ordered by Lord Ding.

373
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,290
I indeed feel guilty about it.

374
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,790
It looks like the title of being the no. 1 assassin in the world needs to be removed.

375
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,340
I indeed should just retire from Jianghu.

376
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,140
You just return to Jianghu.

377
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,870
Now you are retiring again,

378
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,510
and also it's not early or late, you just have to choose when Lord Ding is at a difficult state, right?

379
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,160
Lord Ding said that we should first wait for you to become comfortable and steady before looking for you.

380
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,620
But unexpectedly, you and I bump into each other today.

381
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,910
Then I'll just relay to you his words then.

382
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,160
What did he say?

383
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,130
Lord Ding said that he admires you a lot.

384
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,020
He can forego bothering with the tasks that you were not able to complete.

385
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,430
And also, Lord Ding has already guessed that you would return that money.

386
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,800
Hero Qian, I can take that money away.

387
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,490
But it doesn't mean that the matters between you and Lord Ding are all settled.

388
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,010
This is a favor that you owe him.

389
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,400
You must repay it in the future.

390
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,850
Okay.

391
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,360
As long as it isn't against my work principles, I won't refuse it.

392
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,330
Hero Qian, let me give you some advice.

393
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,100
Although Lord Ding right now has fallen into dire straits,

394
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,530
if he wants to turn things around, it's just a matter of a blink of an eye.

395
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,690
Then I wish everything goes Lord Ding's way.

396
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,260
Hero Qian, take care.

397
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,730
Bai Ze, please understand this.

398
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,260
Our past friendship was all fake.

399
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,990
Right now, whoever holds the Star Chart, that's the owner.

400
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,430
You want it? Then come and get it.

401
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:06,710
A Ji Ya, aren't these words of yours too much?

402
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,880
In our journey, we shared happiness and hardships together.

403
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,260
We also treated you sincerely as a friend.

404
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,730
That's right. Aren't we one group?

405
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,790
Those are just your one-sided thoughts.

406
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,700
Now I don't kill you. It's counted as my payment for this debt of friendship.

407
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,620
A Ji Ya...

408
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,760
Then why must you save us every time?

409
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,170
A Ji Ya!

410
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,760
Let go.

411
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,220
We have been through so many things together.

412
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,690
Don't you really treat us as friends?

413
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,730
i never treated you all as friends.

414
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,420
Your eyes tell me

415
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,840
that you don't think this way.

416
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,350
I don't want to loose you as a friend, either.

417
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,810
Bai Ze, stop being that you are always right.

418
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,780
Do you think that I really won't dare to kill you?

419
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,400
A Ji Ya!

420
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,790
Let go. Let go!

421
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,350
Bai Ze!

422
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,170
A Ji Ya, are you for real?!

423
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,000
A Ji Ya,

424
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,070
you feel that you can really be cruel enough to do it?

425
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,640
Now that you already hit the person.

426
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,370
You should have vented your anger enough, too.

427
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,280
We still have a mission.

428
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,920
- Don't force me.<br>- A Ji Ya!

429
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,700
A Ji Ya, aren't you being too much?

430
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,580
Pointing your sword towards your own friends.

431
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,210
Don't you have any morality?

432
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,430
Didn't Uncle Zhan take you into the Illuminati and raise you?

433
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,490
And then afterwards, just to save us all,

434
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:02,050
he sacrificed his life and died with Elder Zhao Ran.

435
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,530
Isn't that affection?

436
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,770
You only think of your own pain.

437
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,870
But have you thought about what Older Bro Fei felt?

438
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:18,340
He just reunited with his own father and didn't have enough time to reminisce with him,

439
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,320
he already had to say goodbye to him forever.

440
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,330
This pain of losing what one has just obtained,

441
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,960
isn't it more painful than yours?!

442
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,140
Yuan Shuai.

443
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,310
Saying so many highfalutin words can't change the fact that he is a thief!

444
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,930
I was not really some upright person to begin with.

445
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,230
A Ji Ya, the Star Chart is in my hand.

446
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,350
If you want it, then just kill me.

447
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,070
And me!

448
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,860
As long as I am still alive,

449
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,770
I won't let any of you slaughter each other.

450
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,230
Xiong Fei, Yuan Shuai,

451
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,280
my father is the leader of the Heaven Strategy Envoys.

452
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,460
Logically speaking,

453
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,370
all the consequences... should be mine to bear.

454
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,710
Bai Ze, stop that!

455
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,650
Just kill me.

456
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,230
I definitely won't avoid it.

457
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,180
Bai Ze, don't say such stupid words.

458
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,860
A Ji Ya has gone crazy. She really will kill you.

459
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:57,380
If killing me... will make your hatred disappear,

460
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,300
then just kill me.

461
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,130
I am willing to die.

462
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,630
A Ji Ya,

463
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,830
after you kill me, you must continue with Yuan Shuai and Xiong Fei

464
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,590
the mission of gathering the Magic Stars and stabilizing the world.

465
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,900
Okay.

466
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,600
Hey!

467
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,470
Hey! A Ji Ya!

468
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,020
Zhan Xiong Fei, if you don't give me the Star Chart, I'll then kill him.

469
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,270
No. I'll give you the Star Chart then. Here.

470
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,900
Hurry. Go there and arrest them, especially that woman.

471
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,430
- I want her alive.<br>- Yes.

472
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,110
You three indeed have someone helping you.

473
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,430
The little lady looks so pretty.

474
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,190
How come you started to fight?

475
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,480
Could it be there is too little meat for so many wolves?

476
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,880
You...

477
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,360
We...

478
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,810
Only you Toyo people have such dirty thoughts.

479
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,050
I am not with them.

480
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,230
Right. You are mistaken.

481
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,660
She is not with us.

482
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,610
Do you still want to fool me?

483
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,150
In front of me, stop playing good cop and bad cop.

484
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,170
Because all of you are too soft.

485
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,200
Men, arrest them all.

486
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,900
Yes!

487
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,930
So this is the legendary Star Chart that can locate the Magic Star?

488
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,080
Hurry! Throw them all into the sea to feed the sharks! Hurry!

489
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,660
Wait!

490
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,290
I have something to say.

491
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,560
You are already about to die, so what nonsense do you still want to say?

492
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,690
Your aim is to get the Star Chart and to find the Magic Stars.

493
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,060
But what you don't know is that I'm the only person

494
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,750
in this world who knows how to read the Star Chart!

495
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,500
That's right.

496
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,010
In this world, only Older Bro Fei can decode the Star Chart.

497
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,640
Even if you have the Star Chart, you won't be able to locate the Magic Stars.

498
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,900
To put it another way, the Star Chart is just a useless brick to you now.

499
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,000
If that's the case, leave him alive first.

500
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,520
As for the remaining, throw them into the sea to feed the fishes!

501
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,970
Wait!

502
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,560
My condition for working with you is that you must let my comrades go.

503
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,460
And also, you must not hurt them.

504
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,290
Or else, I'd rather die than help you.

505
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,060
Fine.

506
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,410
It's getting more and more interesting.

507
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,900
I just like the kind of people like you with affection and loyalty.

508
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,790
Since you insist on talking conditions with me, then I will also give you my condition.

509
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,910
Immediately tell me the location of the Magic Star.

510
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,910
Or else...

511
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,700
- I'll kill her.<br>- Hey!

512
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,480
You should know... that the sword of us Toyo warriors

513
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,740
can cut through steel like mud.

514
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,370
And also, don't you dare play tricks on me.

515
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,870
That way, you will all die more tragically.

516
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,350
Not saying, is that it?

517
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,760
Okay.

518
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,850
No!

519
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:24,620
Stop!

520
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,700
Could this place be a territory for swindlers?

521
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,730
A Ji Ya...

522
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,380
Xiong Fei, Yuan Shuai!

523
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,780
This smoke has poison. Hurry and escape to the seas.

524
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,100
A Ji Ya...

525
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,410
Yuan Shuai! Xiong Fei! Escape to the waters quickly.

526
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,050
Hurry and go!

527
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,840
Who are you?!

528
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,300
A Ji Ya!

529
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,140
Yuan Shuai!

530
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,780
Come. Come. Here. Here.

531
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,610
Take him away. This one. Take him away.

532
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,220
Okay. Okay. Come.

533
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,370
This one's not bad. He can surely sell for a good price.

534
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,550
Surely no problem.

535
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,660
Take her away.

536
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,310
- And also this one. Take him away, too.<br>- Okay.

537
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,680
This one's not bad. Take him away.

538
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,150
Okay.

539
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,380
Hey...there is even a Toyo man here.

540
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,130
Don't know if anyone will buy him.

541
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,080
Forget it. Just let him go.

542
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,420
Hey, there is even one who escaped there.

543
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,770
It's just one.

544
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,360
Let's go.

545
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,920
Go. Go.

546
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,010
- Let's go now!<br>- Go. Go.

547
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,750
A Ji Ya!

548
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,860
A Ji Ya!

549
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,830
Yaun Shuai!

550
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,620
Xiong Fei!

551
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,420
Where is this place?

552
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,300
Is there anyone around?

553
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,470
Hey, Yuan Shuai.

554
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,890
Yuan Shuai.

555
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,080
Is it time to eat?

556
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,620
What eat?

557
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,960
Look. Where are we?

558
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,530
Where are we?!

559
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,220
How would I know?

560
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,360
How come we ended up here?

561
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,600
Yuan Shuai, what is this?

562
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,210
You also have one.

563
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,540
- That's right. 100?<br>- What does it mean?

564
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,170
- How about we ask around?<br>- Okay.

565
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,430
Who will we ask?

566
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,620
- How about... that bald head?<br>- Okay. Go.

567
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,930
Hey! Bald head!

568
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,910
Where are we now?

569
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,770
Where?

570
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,560
You'll know later.

571
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,600
Then... Then what does this mean?

572
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,070
You'll know later.

573
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,270
Hey. If we know, why would we still ask you?

574
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,510
That's right. Just hurry and say it.

575
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,430
Hey, Big Bro, I feel that we should calm down a little!

576
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,760
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. His feet are also tied up.

577
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,030
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. He is chained. He is chained.

578
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,830
Come. Come.

579
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,420
- Bring them out.<br>- Yes!

580
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,740
- Open the door!<br>- Yes.

581
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,640
Why did you lock us up?

582
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,710
Stop your nonsense.

583
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,520
The show for today will be starting soon.

584
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,920
Is it a celebratory show?

585
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,860
Is there anyone around?

586
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,940
Time to eat.

587
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,550
What is this place?

588
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,240
- Just eat.<br>- I'm asking you, what is this place?

589
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,490
I am just a servant that delivers food.

590
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,210
I don't know anything else.

591
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,420
I won't eat your food.

592
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,310
Whether you eat or not has nothing to do with me.

593
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,680
I am just a food delivery person.

594
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,430
Take me out.

595
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,510
Drop the chopsticks. You are not going anywhere.

596
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,550
Just behave and stay here.

597
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,880
Buddies, let's go.

598
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,040
Hey, that girl does have some skills.

599
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,180
We should be careful.

600
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,760
How long have you been working with us here?

601
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,190
Just that kind of woman?

602
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,140
Starve and scare her for three days and

603
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,920
I guarantee you that she'll obediently go out and serve the guests.

604
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,200
That is indeed.

605
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,570
In a few days, I will be transferred to the main hall.

606
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,120
The task to watch these people will be left with you guys.

607
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,000
You just do your job well. Boss Sakai won't treat you unfairly.

608
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,680
Yes. Yes. Older Bro Jie's words are right.

609
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,670
Let's go. Let's go out and have a drink.

610
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,310
<i>I just got out of the tiger's den but ended up in the wolf's lair.</i>

611
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,290
<i>Now, no one will come to save me anymore.</i>
