1
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,300
FEARS
OF THE DARK

2
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,482
I'm afraid it would be hard

3
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,503
for me to prove the superiority
of Western civilization

4
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,304
to an Afghan villager who's
watching TV with me.

5
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,250
I'm afraid to be invited
unexpectedly some day

6
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,117
at friends of friends

7
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,338
and get served fat white
crawling maggots

8
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,080
or fried flying locusts

9
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,525
or baked snake with sauce.

10
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,631
The pain... wakes me up.

11
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,125
It's almost time...
for my medication.

12
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,940
It's... day.

13
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,371
Another day.

14
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,916
It seems cold outside.

15
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,277
Cold and grey.

16
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,758
When I was little, I thought
it was always cold.

17
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,156
We lived in the North,
in the countryside.

18
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,910
There wasn't a living soul to
be found for miles around.

19
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,959
Because I was all alone,
I had to find diversion.

20
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,212
I went to explore the forest.

21
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,030
I was looking for
interesting animals and plants.

22
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,762
And insects.

23
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,304
I was fascinated by insects.

24
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,276
Mom prohibited me to bring my
specimen home.

25
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,955
She found them dirty and disgusting.

26
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,551
Eric, is that you?
Dinner's almost ready!

27
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,950
Yes, mom. I'm coming!

28
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,436
Even though she hated my
collection of insects,

29
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,171
she still encouraged my interest
in science

30
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,716
and let me set up a corner
in my room.

31
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,586
My lab.

32
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,491
That was my refuge.

33
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,115
There I spend hours and hours
experimenting

34
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,226
and studying my specimen.

35
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,396
Eric, come here! Come here!

36
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,147
I'm coming, mom!

37
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,749
Without knowing why,
I hid the goblet under my bed.

38
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,432
Eric!

39
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,667
I probably didn't want my
mother to find it.

40
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,715
After dinner I hurried to my room.

41
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,122
But it was gone.

42
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,506
I looked everywhere, but my
little specimen wasn't to be found.

43
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,561
In the end I gave up.

44
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,060
It was hard to forget.

45
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,399
For years I often heard the
same noise.

46
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,677
Something crawling and itching.

47
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,786
At the back of my bed.

48
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,090
I took the bed with me when I
left for college.

49
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,619
I found a small apartment just for me
close to the campus.

50
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,632
I didn't want a room mate

51
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,092
who would distract me.

52
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,483
All I needed,

53
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,320
was a nice quiet place to work.

54
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,244
After all those years in seclusion
I found it difficult to meet people,

55
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,106
especially girls.

56
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,485
- Look at that dickhead!
- Hey you! What's your problem?

57
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,570
You want my photo?
You won't see me for a long time!

58
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,475
They were pretty and charming.

59
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,949
But it was impossible to get
in touch with them.

60
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,372
Excuse me.

61
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,744
That's why I was so surprised
when Laura entered my life.

62
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,021
I don't want to disturb you, but...
you take biology with Schermann, don't you?

63
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,046
Eh... yes... I... I...

64
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,487
I've seen you there.
You always look so serious.

65
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,060
You have your nose in a book
and you're taking notes all the time.

66
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,476
I've missed the last lesson.
Can I borrow your notes?

67
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,285
Eh yes. Of course. Here... they are.

68
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,732
You'll get them back soon, okay?

69
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,076
By the way, my name is Laura.

70
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,331
Eh... um... Eric. I'm Eric.

71
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,950
Thanks, Eric. I have to go.

72
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,028
Hello, Laura? It's Eric. Ah... no.
Not too fast, not too fast.

73
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,380
Laura? It's Eric.
From biology class...

74
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,442
No... no.

75
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,202
What am I doing?

76
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,316
- Hello?
- Laura? It's Eric...

77
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,221
- Eric from the biology class.
- Hello, Eric!

78
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,700
Hey, your notes are great!
Do you want them back already?

79
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,084
Actually I wanted...
Do you want to go to the cinema or...

80
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,907
To the cinema? Okay! Cool!

81
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,414
- Really? Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

82
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,186
At what time does the movie start?

83
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,526
- Do you get it now?
- What?

84
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,756
That you're mine... just mine!

85
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,310
- Oh, Jack... yes... Yes!
- Yeah, that's right.

86
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,184
- You're all mine!
- Oh, Jack! What are you doing?

87
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,753
- Yes.
- Oh, no!

88
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,742
Leave me be. Leave me be!

89
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,435
I wasn't really watching the film...

90
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,390
...sitting there next to Laura...

91
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,812
...was enough to make me happy.

92
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,796
- Oh, no!
- Yes!

93
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,537
Yes!

94
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,455
I think the movie was great!
Very moving and romantic.

95
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,557
It should be like that
in real life too.

96
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,347
Are we getting a drink?

97
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,183
Yummy! Vodka always gives me
a strange feeling!

98
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,164
She was giving me a strange feeling.

99
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,859
When she wanted to kiss me,
I thought I would die.

100
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,990
- I think I'll have another one. You?
- Eh, yes... of course.

101
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,824
I wasn't used to bars,
or alcohol.

102
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,986
But I didn't want Laura to think
I'm a sucker.

103
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,947
All right!
I like it when you smile.

104
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,669
I like your dimples.

105
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,950
I had the feeling
I was dragged into a dream.

106
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,014
I wanted that dream to last forever.

107
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,541
Wow!
Your apartment is nice.

108
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,952
Let's see...

109
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,770
When she asked to come
along to my apartment...

110
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,224
What's over there?

111
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,107
...I heard myself respond:
"Yes".

112
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,782
What a sweet little bed!

113
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,286
But that's a cowboy bed!

114
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,710
Do you want to play Cowboys and Indians?
Bang, bang!

115
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,672
I know it's ridiculous, but...

116
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,411
I didn't have money to buy a new one.

117
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,466
But I didn't say it's ridiculous.
I'm teasing you!

118
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,891
You're so serious!
Come here.

119
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,456
Let's see if you're as serious
as you look.

120
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,564
Acting like the quiet guy?
Need a little push?

121
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,258
Laura?

122
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,844
Laura, wake up...
You're hurt!

123
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,237
- But...!
- You have a cut in your arm!

124
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,466
Good morning.

125
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,481
Don't I get my good morning kiss?

126
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,852
Don't move! I'll be right back!
I'll put a bandage on your arm.

127
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,837
Don't worry.
It will be alright.

128
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,586
The cut looked deep and ugly.

129
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,595
I didn't understand how she
could stay so calm.

130
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,393
I'll be careful.

131
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,571
If it hurts
or if it's too tight...

132
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,267
let me know, okay?

133
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,593
There.

134
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,436
That will do the job for a while.

135
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,446
If you get dressed, I can take
you to the campus hospital.

136
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,519
But I don't need a doctor...
I need you.

137
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,506
A kiss and all will be fine.

138
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,415
Come... I won't bite, you know.

139
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,501
You see... that wasn't so bad.

140
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,596
Okay... if you're sure you
don't want to see a doctor,

141
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,012
we might attend class.

142
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,045
But it's so nice here with you...

143
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,931
I don't feel like leaving.

144
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,389
That day I got to class far too late.

145
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,307
When I got home in the evening...

146
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,401
I was exhausted.

147
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,137
Good evening!

148
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,486
I was looking forward to you coming home.
Dinner's ready!

149
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,604
After a hard day's work
I bet you have an appetite for a nice meal.

150
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,882
That looks good.

151
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,940
Her behavior was strange,

152
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,919
but did I really want it to change?

153
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,394
No... finally I had a girlfriend.

154
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,712
And she was sexy...

155
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,906
and she seemed to like me.

156
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,675
It was great for a while...

157
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,845
Really great.

158
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,028
But as the days went by,
something changed.

159
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,223
Laura, I have to finish that chapter.
I have a biology exam tomorrow.

160
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,382
What? Did I say something wrong?

161
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,187
I would like to know

162
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,423
what's more important to you.
Me or your stupid books?

163
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,347
Things got worse.

164
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,890
Worse and worse.
She didn't attend classes any more.

165
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,181
Like nothing mattered to her
any more, expect me.

166
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,781
She only left the apartment
to get food.

167
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,700
It seemed like her only reason
to exist

168
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,526
was to make rich, heavy dishes
for me.

169
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,987
She changed physically as well...

170
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,351
- You're mine!
- ...she got stronger...

171
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,131
- You're all mine.
- ...more masculine.

172
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,486
You're my bitch!
Eh?

173
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,997
You're mine forever!

174
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,673
Yes!

175
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,322
You're mine...

176
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,906
One day I got home from class

177
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,197
to discover she cut off
her pretty long hair.

178
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,977
Laura?

179
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,965
Then I knew the end was close at hand.

180
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,020
Here, I made you a refreshment.

181
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,531
Thanks, but I'm not thirsty.

182
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,788
I have prepared it for you.
Come drink it up. Now!

183
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,475
Okay, don't worry.

184
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,611
Waking up, finally?

185
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,392
Easy.

186
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,876
Don't worry.

187
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,407
It won't take long.

188
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,467
What's keeping them?

189
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,572
The pain is getting worse...

190
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,295
and the heat...
it's much too hot in here.

191
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,989
I just want my medicine.

192
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,011
I just want...

193
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,912
to sleep.

194
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,341
I know things will never be
like before.

195
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,212
That's all over and done with,

196
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,877
forever and ever.

197
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,026
But I would want so much,
she still loved me.

198
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,784
Or at least she pretends to love me.

199
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,285
I'm afraid to die from torture,

200
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,255
cancer, a traffic accident.

201
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,276
Ah, to find the right way?
I'm hesitating.

202
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,517
When making love?

203
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,542
I'll have to find someone then,
Because these days...

204
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,042
If it's okay, I want to start over,

205
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,346
if it's insignificant,
I don't want to end up like that. I refuse.

206
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,796
Dead, the scandal...
I don't want to do it according to the rules.

207
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,916
I don't want to die joyfully.

208
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,180
That after everything, after so little,

209
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,501
nothing, just nothing remains,
no... I can't,

210
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,913
I refuse.

211
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,426
I'm afraid I don't have a
political conscience.

212
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,100
Maybe I'm hiding the truth from myself,
and I belong to the Right? Or worse?

213
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,070
I notice lately that I'm always
looking for reasons not to get involved.

214
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,394
But most of all I'm sensitive
to conservative arguments.

215
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,147
Most things shouldn't change too much,
youth can't stand in our way,

216
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,550
we should be able to reap the benefits
of what we acquired.

217
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,727
I'll become Left of center.

218
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,847
I'm afraid of mediocrity.

219
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,020
I'd rather be a zero,
than mediocre.

220
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,646
To be unnoticed,
that's not a worthy destiny.

221
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,130
But I don't want to be pure.
The pure threatens us.

222
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,485
A messiah without scruples
will come and launder us.

223
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,870
To the vice. To the bone.

224
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,606
We shall not be able to see
behind the scenes of the big laundry.

225
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,646
Help!

226
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,882
Today we welcome a new student.

227
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,802
Introduce yourself to your class mates.

228
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,101
Ayakawa Sumako. I'll try
to be a good student.

229
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,460
- Where do you live, Sumako-san?
- The old house at the waterfalls.

230
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,126
Behind the cemetery?

231
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,987
Yes I live there with my mother.

232
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,492
We used to live abroad,
in London where my father...

233
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,503
"Hajime, Hajime, where are you,
here's a stranger..."

234
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,408
Children!

235
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,866
You'll have samurai Hajime
to deal with!

236
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,508
Be silent!

237
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,877
Who is this samurai Hajime?

238
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,327
It's an old story, Sumako-san.

239
00:27:57,531 --> 00:28:01,649
The samurai has been dead for 100 years.
He's buried in the cemetery.

240
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,927
You'll see him tonight.
He'll chop strangers to pieces.

241
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:07,220
That's enough!
Sumako, you can sit down.

242
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,175
Michio, as you're so smart:
Why was Hajime executed?

243
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,612
You don't know. Stupid!

244
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,307
Nobody knows?

245
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,109
That will be the lesson for today.
Open your books to page 100.

246
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,721
Sumako, are you reading
the text next to the image?

247
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:27,489
Yes!

248
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,123
"Samurai Hajime of the Satsuma-clan"

249
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,854
was condemned to commit Seppuku, a ritual
suicide, because he had robbed

250
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,565
and chopped to pieces an English officer
on the road to Tokaido

251
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,990
"in the year 1865, the Edo era."

252
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,987
We are waiting for you, new one.

253
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,061
We are descendants of
samurai Hajime.

254
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,832
Hajime, you remember?

255
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,313
You are really ridiculous!

256
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,482
Yes? Really?

257
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Do you dare to ridicule us?
You'd better not do that, Sumako.

258
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,470
That's the way we treat people who aren't
from around here! Stop it! Have mercy!

259
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,757
- Go on, sweeties, go tickle her!
- No!

260
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,859
No!

261
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,326
It doesn't work like that, Sumako-chan!

262
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,671
You can't wake up in the middle of it,

263
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,196
you have to finish your dream until the end.

264
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,900
You have to sleep, Sumako-chan...

265
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,193
Sleep...

266
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,002
sleep...

267
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,513
Is anyone here?

268
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,762
Is anyone here?

269
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,966
Those fools are trying to scare me...

270
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,747
You are silly!

271
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,246
Don't hide yourselves,
I have seen you!

272
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,122
Samurai Hajime's grave!

273
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,812
Leaving already?

274
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,835
The samurai will come.

275
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,930
You don't seem to appreciate
our company.

276
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,669
Stay for a while,
you won't be disappointed.

277
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,901
- And the samurai will gladly...
- Stop it!

278
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,906
There, there, don't get excited, Sumako,

279
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,806
- you look tensed.
- And you didn't believe in ghosts.

280
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,233
Tomoko?
Michio?

281
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,953
You're going to die!

282
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,322
No! Stop it!!

283
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,587
Sumako,

284
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,510
Sumako...

285
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,526
Michio!

286
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,497
Sumako's brains...

287
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,012
Is that you, Sumako-chan?

288
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,992
Sumako?

289
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,632
Sumako?!

290
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,506
Has your first day at school gone well?

291
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,566
Now, Sumako-chan,
did you go on until the end?

292
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,556
That's not the way to do it, Sumako.

293
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,060
You have to finish your dream,
if you want to be cured...

294
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,036
cured...

295
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,482
cured...

296
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,011
cured...

297
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,811
I'm afraid to contribute to the
exhaustion of the planet

298
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,697
and not have the courage to do
something about it.

299
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,917
I don't know what to do.

300
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:07,510
I'm afraid because I'm not doing anything.
And I do nothing because I'm afraid.

301
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,816
I absolutely have to do something!

302
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,806
I'm full of small fears
filling my head,

303
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,286
accompanying and surrounding me
like blunt poles.

304
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,101
They make me cringe!
Exist? Yes, but how?

305
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,867
Inside, outside, up? Down?

306
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,628
I'm afraid of humans.

307
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,935
Humans seem to be like wolves to humans,
but wolves aren't wolves to wolves.

308
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,002
A wolf doesn't devour another wolf.

309
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,556
But a human being... is a dangerous animal.

310
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,974
He exterminates animals. Picks the flowers.
Massacres his own kind.

311
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,271
They all agree to murder, intellectuals
and proletarians, the clean and unclean,

312
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,500
out of free will or forced,
with a pint, or an order,

313
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,761
through the head and forward, mate.

314
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,393
And women nowadays

315
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,990
join in as well, on all levels,
the woman is the future of the man.

316
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,605
Here, a bullet in the head, bastard.

317
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,565
I have the right, it seems,
I protect myself, I anticipate.

318
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,237
By accident I wound up

319
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,160
in the region where I spend
the most summers of my youth.

320
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,197
The great plains.

321
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,414
One of these summers had been
very peculiar.

322
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,446
Everything started with the
disappearance of my uncle.

323
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,322
He was poaching at night,

324
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,500
but his boat ran ashore.

325
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,443
It was empty.

326
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,464
Every night my aunt went to church
to pray for him.

327
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,883
I went along with her.

328
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,183
While she cried, I went outside
to play with my friend.

329
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,342
Often, always around the same time,

330
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,852
the ducks left the swamps.

331
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,388
Their behavior arose suspicions
of what would occur in coming days.

332
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,507
My friend who really didn't have any family

333
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,966
and who passed his time in the fields,

334
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,629
knew a lot of secrets about the animals.

335
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,165
One evening the last duck in the row
passed by with a broken wing.

336
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,558
According to my friend a wild animal which was
sneaking around in the area, was responsible for it.

337
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:49,118
And maybe one day we would face this
wild animal as well.

338
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,063
That night I slept with my eyes firmly shut

339
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,146
to keep away horrible dreams.

340
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,229
In the morning the police officers fished up
the maimed head of a farmer.

341
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,660
A gruesome crime!

342
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,026
Who could have done a thing like this?

343
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,637
My friend knew:

344
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,901
There are wild animals that descend
straight from the clouds,

345
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,726
and one of them was probably hiding
in the swamp.

346
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,326
That night

347
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,485
not a word was uttered at my aunt's.

348
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,530
And then, one afternoon,
my friend disappeared as well.

349
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,387
The whole village went looking for him.

350
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,146
The fog was increasing ever more.

351
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,086
And I got lost...

352
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,556
like in a dream.

353
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,531
His bicycle was found.

354
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,826
But that discovery
didn't put me at ease at all.

355
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,832
And the night fell.

356
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,205
What I thought I had seen,
was that my friend?

357
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,046
Or was it that monster?

358
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,019
Unless those two...
were one and the same being?

359
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,364
Eventually the game-keeper in charge
was brought in from the city.

360
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,756
To that man, who had crossed the mysterious
jungles of Africa,

361
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,364
it didn't matter if it was a wild animal
or a murderer.

362
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,199
Three days and three nights
he hid himself in the church-tower.

363
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,882
When he came down,

364
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,436
a wild scent was surrounding him.

365
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,499
He asked him to bring the
fattest goose in town,

366
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,427
and he started to set his trap.

367
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,429
Women and children were kept away
from the area.

368
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,316
Nobody was allowed to make any noise.

369
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,420
Since then no one in the region
had disappeared again,

370
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,076
even though my uncle has never returned

371
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,675
and my friend has never been found again.

372
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,464
Now old women are lighting ceremonial
candles for the crocodile in the church,

373
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,844
even though they pretend the candles are
meant for this or that saint.

374
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,749
A while later I woke up in the
middle of the night.

375
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,541
It was my friend, no doubt about it.

376
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,476
I was sure I wasn't mistaken.

377
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,005
We never saw each other again.

378
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:14,119
The day I visited the place
the crocodile was still hanging around,

379
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,516
I remembered that old story.

380
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,544
I didn't dare wait
for darkness to fall.

381
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,141
It was like I was afraid
to see my old friend again.

382
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,613
Who knows what other secrets
he might have been hiding.

383
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,084
Maybe he descended
from the clouds as well.

384
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,006
I'm afraid I would contempt all
those who are different too easily.

385
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,461
And because I don't accept myself
as I am, that poses a problem.

386
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,515
Because those who resemble me,
depress me,

387
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,910
and that gives me a negative image.

388
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,925
I'm afraid I would be an
incorrigible bourgeois,

389
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,350
I can't accept that,
how did that get into my head?

390
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,666
The rich irritate me, the poor repel me,
the middle class get on my nerves.

391
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,118
Help! Hurry, a monastery,
something authentic, peace.

392
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,923
But real peace, not fake.

393
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,372
No rattan furniture,
no Scientologist from Hollywood

394
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,347
declamating in Tibetan.

395
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,517
I'm afraid of indigestion.

396
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,541
We all eat shamelessly like pigs.
Yes!

397
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,232
Like pigs.

398
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,636
Children!
We'll leave you the crusts.

399
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,891
I'm afraid I would blush for
joy if I'd go shopping.

400
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,491
Sometimes it does my heart good
to have a chocolate mousse.

401
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,046
Okay, it has been prepared industrially,
but it's tasty.

402
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,574
And all those who don't have the means?
Look, she only chooses super digestible food.

403
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,815
Come on, Simone,
we support the agricultural food complex!

404
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,371
But can't you see it's a fraud?

405
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,431
I'm afraid I won't be really useful
just one time in my life.

406
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,006
For example to make clear to a racist,

407
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:14,183
to a single racist that it's cowardly,
dumb and mean to be a racist.

408
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,027
But I have tried carefully once or twice.

409
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,530
It's hard to control myself and to
stick to the part

410
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,450
of a democrat who respects the differences,

411
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,267
but is uncompromising about the basic values.

412
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,831
Then the other will look at me in shame,

413
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,076
but I feel like it's slipping away from me.

414
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,260
I can only convince people who
agree from the beginning.

415
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,269
Help! Cicero, Louise Michel, Montesquieu,
Martin Luther King, Benetton!

416
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,720
I'm afraid I would come across
as being sympathetic.

417
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:40,886
It's horrible to be sympathetic.

418
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,062
How was your life?

419
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,732
Sympathetic.
