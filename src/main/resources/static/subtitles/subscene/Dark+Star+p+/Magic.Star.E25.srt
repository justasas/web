2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,780
From what I know, when General Su was still alive,

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,150
you already said that you wanted to eliminate Ding Song.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,020
But this thing never happened.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,530
Now that you have fallen into this state,

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,020
you don't even have an army.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,780
Why is it you still speak so arrogantly?

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,650
Ma Da Dao!

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,790
Your Majesty, he is just a boor.

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,570
- He doesn't know how to speak properly.<br>- Who is a boor?

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,100
You must not bother with him.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,880
Hey, you say. Hey...

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,210
Ma Da Dao, go to the kitchen and take a look

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,180
if the food for His Majesty is already done.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,020
- Go.<br>- Sure.

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,990
He is really not giving His Majesty any respect!

17
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,020
If we were in the palace--

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,990
Eunuch Cao,

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,650
this isn't the palace.

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,610
We are on someone else's territory now.

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,010
Miss Qian Xun, this time I really have to thank you properly.

22
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,320
Your Majesty, you still have to properly thank one person.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,660
If not for her rushing to get help, we wouldn't have even known something happened to you.

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,150
Oh?

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,460
Qian Meng, why are you still here?

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,920
His Majesty is back. Won't you be in a hurry to see him?

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,790
But... His Majesty didn't call for me, either.

28
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,950
Hurry and just come with me.

29
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,600
Go and see His Majesty now.

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,840
Tell him all the hardships you endured

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,040
and your daily yearnings for him.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,920
Hey, come.

33
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,490
Come in.

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,550
Qian Meng?!

35
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,220
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,600
It's really you.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,750
I thought I was dreaming.

39
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,830
Instead of recuperating well,

40
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,340
why are you peeking while other people are having sweet talks?

41
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,740
I... just passed by.

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,060
Why did you come here?

43
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,810
It's time to eat. I'm here to call them to eat.

44
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,380
Move aside.

45
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,500
It's me.

46
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,750
This is not a dream.

47
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,090
I am Qian Meng.

48
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,150
I thought that I would never see you again in my lifetime.

49
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,160
I previously made an oath to Heaven.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,210
Even if there is just a glimmer of hope,

51
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,450
regardless whether I have to go up a mountain full of blades or through a sea of fire,

52
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,900
I must save you.

53
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,130
- If one day... something bad happens to you--<br>- Hey...

54
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,810
Forger it. Just let them finish their talk.

55
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,350
Hey, I know the pain that you are feeling now.

56
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,920
This thing called love...

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,570
A melon that's forcefully picked before it's ripe isn't sweet.

58
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,930
Just accept your fate.

59
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,190
Look. Aren't I doing well now?

60
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,590
Qian Meng, these past days, you suffered a lot.

61
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,540
I really don't know how to make it up to you.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,080
How about this, just tell me what you want.

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,720
Even if it's the moon in the sky, I'll think of a way to give it to you.

64
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,990
I don't want anything. I just want Your Majesty to be well.

65
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,950
Being just a lowly imperial doctor is already fine with me.

66
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,900
I understand what you mean.

67
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,520
But if I don't thank you well,

68
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,730
I will feel guilty about it.

69
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,390
If Your Majesty will really want to give me a reward, then I beg you to spare one person.

70
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,850
Hey, get up, get up.

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,720
This is easy to do.

72
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,580
As long as that person isn't Ding Song.

73
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,180
No matter what crime he committed,

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,660
as long as you say it, I will pardon his crimes.

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,470
Come in!

76
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,770
He is...

77
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,650
Your Majesty, when you were put under house arrest by Ding Song,

78
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,280
his is the person that Ding Song used evil techniques on to disguise as you.

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,040
- May His Majesty spare his crime of treason and deceiving the emperor.<br>-Oh?

80
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,050
<i>♫ I'm sorry that I'm not a doll. ♫</i>

81
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,090
<i>♫ Smiling for a long time will make me tired. ♫</i>

82

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,140
<i>♫ I'm too lazy to pretend again. ♫</i>

84
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,260
Royal Father, I finally found you all.

85
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,980
I missed you.

86
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,610
I feel so down right now.

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,470
Royal Father, please guide me to what path I should take.

88
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,070
Should I just forget these grudges and never again enter the Central Plains?

89
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,720
Do you also hope that I stay by your side forever?

90
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,080
I have fallen in love with Bai Ze.

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,670
<i>♫ Do we really love? ♫</i>

92
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,450
<i>No matter how hard I try to forget him,</i>

93
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,430

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,540
<i>I clearly had so many chances</i>

97
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,030
<i>to point my sword towards his throat.</i>

98
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,050
<i>But I can't bear to...</i>

99
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,130
<i>♫ Open a model of full view ♫</i>

100
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,330
I really hate myself so much.

101
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,790
How come I can't do all of these things?

102
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,360
I previously thought that Bai Ze,

103
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,260
<i>Zhang Xiong Fei, and Yuan Shuai were all my friends.</i>

104
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,390
<i>I know that all of these were wrong,</i>

105
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,810
<i>but I kept moving towards them.</i>

106
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,840
Why?

107
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,990
Why must Heaven make fun of me?

108
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,770
I totally can't do anything about it.

109
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,180
I don't know what to do.

110
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,140
<i>♫...that kind of graciousness you want ♫</i>

You tell me, what should I do?

114
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,670
You teach me, okay?!

115
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,580
I really am in so much pain...

116
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,210
<i>For you.</i>

117
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,690
<i>♫ Do we really love? ♫</i>

118
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,350

126
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,950
Keep your distance from that thing.

127
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,860
That is the resting place of the ancestors of the Helan tribe.

128
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,400
I am here to pay respect to my parents.

129
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,450
Are you talking about King Salin?

130
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,770
Are you Princess A Ji Ya or Princess Gu Li?

131
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,650
I am A Ji Ya.

132
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,750
You've grown up.

133
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,340
You... know my father?

134
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,890
I knew him for a long time. He is a deceased old friend.

135
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,060
Then how long have you lived here?

136
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,050
I don't remember anymore. Probably 4 to 5 years.

137
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,310
For these past years, I guarded this place although I don't know what I am waiting for.

138
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,990
Initially, I thought that I'm here to wait for the day of my death

139
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,900
and accept my sentence by Heaven. But right now, I understand it.

140
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,430
It was Heaven who arranged it for me to stay here and wait for you.

141
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,230
What do you mean by that?

142
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,600
Who really are you?

143
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,790
I am A Lamusi.

144
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,460
You are the rebel A Lamusi?!

145
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,220
So all of you call me as such...

146
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,590
There was even a time when I was soaking in

147
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,570
the address of King Helan by other people.

148
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,280
When the tribe encountered difficult times, you were holding much power,

149
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,080
yet you didn't immediately come to save us

150
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,050
and instead signed a contract with the Emperor.

151
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,660
Do you know that the downfall of our tribe

152
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,890
is one-half your responsibility?!

153
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,680
I admit to everything that you said.

154
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,090
Today, if you don't explain things clearly, I will kill you!

155
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,320
A Ji Ya, listen to me.

156
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,090
I've long contracted a severe illness long ago and won't live long.

157
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,390
You don't need to rush in killing me.

158
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,330
I just beg you to give me the chance to finish my words.

159
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,100
Afterwards, you can kill me.

160
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,620
Say it.

161
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,200
At that time, the news about your Royal Father

162
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,600
obtained a magic star under Mount Helan

163
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,500
was spreading fast.

164
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,000
Your father was unwilling to hand it over so

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,800
he then rejected the officials sent by the Emperor here to receive the Magic Star.

166
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,000
Unexpectedly, the Emperor secretly sent the top Heaven Strategy Envoys

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to come here and fight for the Magic Star.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That time, I did my best to negotiate with the Emperor with hope to reach an agreement

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,100
because I wanted them to just take the Magic Star away but not harm your father.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,300
Never thought, in the end, it led to such disaster.

171
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,560
I won't believe these vain excuses of yours.

172
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,100
You clearly are just trying to exonerate yourself.

173
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,800
Afterwards, I succeeded to take over the management for the tribe as I had wished and

174
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
because the King Helan that people were talking about.

175
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Yet my heart was full of guilt towards your father.

176
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,200
But when he was still alive, I promised him that if ever something bad happened to him,

177
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I would then continue his will

178
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
to lead our tribe into great heights

179
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,800
and live a rich, contented, and blissful life.

180
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,140
But I was too stupid.

181
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,600
I never thought that my...

182
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,800
son who got blinded by power would rebel against me and took away my throne.

183
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,400
Right now, he is continuing to call himself King Helan

184
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,200
while I can only be exiled alone.

185
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,200
I initially planned to commit suicide to apologize to Heaven and our tribe's ancestors.

186
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,000
But with the play of fate, I ended up here.

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,600
Hence, I just stayed here and kept guarding your father's tomb.

188
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,400
Praying and repenting everyday.

189
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,790
Right now, I beg you to kill me.

190
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,600
Let me to completely be cleaned of my sins in this lifetime.

191
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
I won't kill you anymore.

192
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm sure that you also are very guilty because of this matter.

193
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,000
You are indeed King Salin's daughter.

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,600
Like him, you have a kind heart that's purer than the moon and

195
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,900
a chest that's broader than this meadow's.

196
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,500
Thank you.

197
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,100
No need to thank me.

198
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,600
If you want to thank anyone, thank my Royal Father.

199
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,600
If it was him, he'd forgive you.

200
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,800
I am not thanking you for sparing me.

201
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,200
I just want to say thank you for listening to my words.

202
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,300
Letting my heart be peaceful before I die.

203
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,100
What are you doing?!

204
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,600
Thank you for saving me.

205
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,800
Only by doing this can I clean all of my crimes.

206
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
If I knew that my appearance would make you...

207
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,930
No. No. No.

208
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,000
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You are the one who untangled my heart's knot.

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Get up.

211
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,140
A Ji Ya, my child.

212
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,100
I heard earlier the words you said in front of you father's tomb.

213
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:46,600
If you are willing to hear my advice, I would be very happy.

214
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,300
You say it.

215
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,900
The thing that can resolve hatred and grudges in this world isn't one's fist

216
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,220
but the great love in one's heart.

217
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,770
When you are willing to put down the entanglement in your heart

218
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,960
and try to forgive can you start seeing the wonderfulness of this world.

219
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,180
The past will become the past.

220
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,800
Your future cannot be one that lives in hatred and grudges.

221
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,280
Go follow the love and kindness in your heart.

222
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,600
Go look for your friend.

223
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
<i>Just let bygones be bygones.</i>

224
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,580
<i>Starting today, you're a free person.</i>

225
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,400
<i>You don't need to serve anyone else.</i>

226
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,180
<i>If your father were still alive,</i>

227
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,200
<i>I believe that he would also tell you the same thing.</i>

228
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:34,000
KoreanDramaX.co

229
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,400
Your Majesty, we finally are able to see you again!

230
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,500
<i>Your Majesty, not dying despite such dangerous situations, you surely will be blessed later!</i>

231
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,940
After seeing you, we finally have the courage.

232
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,400
How were you all able to find this place?

233
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,000
Your Majesty, it was Eunuch Cao who sent us the message.

234
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,600
We were afraid that information might be leaked so we traveled out of the city overnight.

235
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,500
Through that, we were able to see you.

236
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,210
Your Majesty, we all deserved to die.

237
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,400
We are so ashamed to meet our ancestors.

238
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,800
In these past days that Your Majesty went missing, we all have said numerous words against our hearts and

239
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,530
did so many things against our will.

240
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,400
May Your Majesty punish us.

241
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,000
Lord He, don't say those kinds of words anymore.

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,800
If there is someone who did anything wrong, it was me.

243
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I wasn't able to be a good emperor.

244
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,400
I was too lenient on Ding Song causing you all to get dragged into this.

245
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,000
If there is anyone who should be ashamed to face our ancestors, I should be the top one.

246
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,200
Get up now.

247
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

248
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,340
Ma Da Dao, the words you said that day are right.

249
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,960
Right now, I already don't have an army.

250
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,000
If I want to defeat Ding Song, it's really an impossible task.

251
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,600
But I don't believe that Ding Song would really be able to continue this savagery.

252
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,680
Because the people's heart is with ours.

253
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,600
Heaven's justice is with us.

254
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,300
Ma Da Dao, help us until the very end.

255
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,700
I want to borrow the men in your mountain lair.

256
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,930
Once that mob of his loses their leader,

257
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,800
they will surely be like monkeys scattering when the tree falls.

258
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,240
Ma Da Dao, take it as I'm begging you.

259
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,600
I am begging you in behalf of the world's citizens. Is that still not enough?

260
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,190
You already said it that way. If I still don't agree, won't I look like I'm not upholding justice?

261
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,400
All my buddies are with you.

262
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Okay. Ma Da Dao, listen to your conferment.

263
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,400
I am immediately conferring you as General Mighty.

264
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,500
All your mountain lair buddies will also be conferred a status.

265
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,500
Are you still not kneeling down to thank Your Majesty for his grace?

266
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,400
Right. You got conferred to become a general already.

267
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,900
Ma Da Dao, hurry and thank His Majesty.

268
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,300
Okay. Okay. Rise. Rise.

269
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,760
No need.

270
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,900
A hero doesn't stick with these trivial matters. Doesn't stick with these trivial matters.

271
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,000
Come. Let me go first.

272
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,420
I want to congratulate my buddy, Ma Da Dao, being conferred by the Emperor to become a general.

273
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,500
It's something to be happy about.

274
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,720
Come. Congratulations, Ma Da Dao.

275
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,800
Hey, Ma Da Dao, why aren't you drinking?

276
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,900
This wine is especially to congratulate you for becoming a general.

277
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,400
Come. For this second cup, Qian Xun, let me give you a toast.

278
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,800
During these days that I met you, I was very happy.

279
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,400
For the third cup, I still have to toast it to you two.

280
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,610
Just treat it as a farewell wine.

281
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,400
Because... I will soon... be leaving.

282
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,560
What? You are leaving?

283
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,900
Did you get some news about the Magic Stars?

284
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,880
It has nothing to do with the Magic Stars.

285
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,200
I have to go back to see my teacher.

286
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,250
I actually already planned to leave at the time that you came here.

287
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,500
I already got delayed for several days.

288
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,600
We've been together for so long but how come I didn't know that you still have a teacher?

289
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,770
I already haven't seen him for several years.

290
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,600
But unless it's a very emergent reason, he usually won't come to find me.

291
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
And also, in passing, I still have to go to the capital

292
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,400
to finish my matter with Ding Song.

293
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,800
What is there to finish with him?

294
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,160
Each matter must be dealt with separately.

295
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,400
I have my working principles.

296
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,300
Qian Xun? Not talking?

297
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:13,360
Don't you want to know when he will be coming back? Who his teacher is?

298
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,700
I won't ask anything.

299
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,500
I know... that even if I ask, he won't tell.

300
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,430
I also want to tell you.

301
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,800
But there are some things that have no answers at all.

302
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,200
All the things that I want to say are all in this wine now.

303
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Treat it as me thanking you two.

304
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,600
- Come. Hurry. <br>- Hurry.

305
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
- Come.<br>- Sure.

306
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,300
Here.

307
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,500
<i>The ones whose names were crossed out in this list</i>

308
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,900
<i>were those that publicly showed their support for Ding Song.</i>

309
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,140
Even those that are with circles, aren't also 100% dependable.

310
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,420
We still need to carefully consider it.

311
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,980
It was all because of me not doing my job very well.

312
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Your Majesty, how can you say such things about yourself?

313
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,600
Eunuch Cao, look at how many names are in this list.

314
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,400
They all have lost the ideal beliefs.

315
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,000
It's fine whoever will sit on that throne in the Grand Hall.

316
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,800
As long as he can guarantee them a life of wealth and glory,

317
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
isn't that my responsibility?

318
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,400
Your Majesty, you were the one who promoted this ministers.

319
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,200
Most of them are just grass that sway with the wind.

320
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,500
Some are people from the wild grass type and it's hard for them to be loyal.

321
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,400
Eunuch Cao, what really do you want to say?

322
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,010
I feel that Ma Da Dao

323
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,900
is still a bandit to begin with.

324
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,000
Giving the huge task of eliminating Ding Song to a person like him now,

325
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,300
isn't it a little bit risky?

326
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,200
And also, his attitude has always been arrogant.

327
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Eunuch Cao, you are just worrying too much.

328
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Ma Da Dao is my life savior. I, of course, believe him.

329
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,800
Eunuch Cao, for this matter, I feel that what Your Majesty said is right.

330
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,460
Although Ma Da Dao is a boor, he's usually careless but quite sharp at times.

331
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,000
He's a person with affection and faith.

332
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,800
I feel that he totally can be trusted.

333
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,200
Oh, right, Eunuch Cao.

334
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,400
I had been locked up for a long time and lost communication with Bai Ze and the others for so long.

335
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,200
Do you have a way to contact them?

336
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
We only have one last messenger pigeon.

337
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Good thing that Lord He has brought it to us.

338
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
That's great. I'll immediately write a message to them.

339
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,800
<i>[Ding Residence]</i>

340
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,400
- Check the back. <br>- Search!

341
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
- Yes. <br>- Yes.

342
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,480
Stop searching now.

343
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,540
I already searched each and every corner of this place.

344
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,320
Right now, there is not a single person here in Ding Song's residence.

345
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,150
Then based on what you just said, other than us, there is no one else here, right?

346
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,600
Buddies, we are rich now.

347
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,800
Do you want treasures?

348
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,060
Then you might get disappointed.

349
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,000
You all came a step late.

350
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Ding Song has already secretly transported all his treasured belongings out of the city.

351
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,500
And also, he and Ma Shun are missing.

352
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
- There really is nothing left.<br>- That's right.

353
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,900
Even here is all cleared, too.

354
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,200
Ding Song, this old fox, is really sly enough.

355
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,000
There was originally a Magic Star here. Ding Song took it away.

356
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,500
How many Magic Stars are there exactly?

357
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,920
Ma Da Dao, you are back just in time.

358
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,200
Come over and take a look.

359
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Look at the words I wrote for you.

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,500
How was it? "Loyal Hero."

361
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,400
Ma Da Dao, you must not decline it.

362
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,600
These words, Loyal Hero, is so suitable for you.

363
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,900
Oh, right. What do you plan to do in the future?

364
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,600
Do you plan to stay here and guard this place or go back with me to the capital? You decide.

365
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,740
But I still haven't accomplished my task.

366
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,200
Ding Song and Ma Shun currently are missing.

367
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,000
I know. Qian Xun already told me about it.

368
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,130
This is called an evil person having a guilty conscience.

369
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,370
He knew that you saved me.

370
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,000
He understands that his power will soon be gone so he ran away.

371
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,700
I am sure that right now, he really can't cause any trouble.

372
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,080
Don't talk about him anymore.

373
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,800
You better take a look at these words now.

374
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,200
If you don't like it, I'll write you another one.

375
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,500
You tell me and I'll write it.

376
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,000
What you are saying is true, right?

377
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
A king never lies. Come on.

378
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,690
I'll say it then.

379
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,600
During the spring of the 31st year of Mingyang,

380
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,800
the second royal son, Zhi Min, suddenly died.

381
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,040
How did you know about this?

382
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,510
What I know isn't just this.

383
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,100
I know there's an eagle shaped birthmark on your right shoulder, too.

384
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,000
Who are you?

385
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,710
I think that you already know who I am, right?

386
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,600
I initially thought that you didn't know the disgusting things that your father did to my father,

387
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,000
so you were able to stably sit on your throne.

388
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Based on your reaction earlier, I think that you know more than I do.

389
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Am I right? Huh?!

390
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,000
Ma Da Dao, I don't know what you are talking about.

391
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,400
When you leave this door, you are still a meritorious officer, a hero.

392
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,300
You will be able to live a rich life for the rest of your life.

393
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,900
If I wanted those things that you are saying,

394
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,980
I wouldn't have been saying so many words with you earlier.

395
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,900
Don't you know that?

396
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,600
Okay. I understand now.

397
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,600
You also said that you want to strive for vindication.

398
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,800
But nothing can be proven just by a birthmark.

399
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,470
Don't rush.

400
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,600
Wait for me to return to the palace and check the files to confirm.

401
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,600
If it is true, I will surely give you justice.

402
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,280
I'll be waiting for the good news then.

403
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,000
His Majesty has sent a message!

404
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,800
Hurry and read it. What did my older bro say?

405
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Bai Ze, Zi Su, no matter where you two are now, immediately return to the palace.

406
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,300
There is an urgent matter that I must tell you two.

407
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,000
- His Majesty is asking us to return to the Palace?<br>- Right.

408
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,800
His Majesty seems to be rushing us so he surely has some important matters to tell us.

409
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,700
I... won't go back.

410
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,000
If I go back, he won't let me go out again.

411
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,580
We haven't found the Magic Stars.

412
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,780
We'll be meeting for the first time.

413
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,600
It isn't good to be empty handed, is it?

414
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,000
Older Bro Fei, are you going to see your brother-in-law?

415
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,160
It's the Emperor.

416
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,800
What does he lack?

417
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,630
Zi Su, don't worry.

418
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,400
If your older bro won't let you come out afterwards, I will then go and steal you out.

419
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,100
Hey. What really are you two thinking about?

420
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,000
It's not like I'm asking you two to go back for a blind date or meet your father-in-law.

421
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,620
Since His Majesty is calling for us, we then must immediately set out.

422
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,730
Hurry and pack up your things.

423
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,180
Let's leave immediately.

424
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,000
Lord, when did you arrange for all of these things?

425
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,800
Even I don't know.

426
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,390
When His Majesty got saved by someone, I already predicted that something bad would happen.

427
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,500
That's why I already made preparations.

428
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,400
Maybe at this moment, someone is searching our house.

429
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,400
Lord, you really are a prophet.

430
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,000
Do you know what this is called?

431
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,980
- Preparing for the rainy days. Courage--<br>- Enough already.

432
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,320
What time is it already and you are still trying to suck up.

433
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,000
You all leave now.

434
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
Yes.

435
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,800
Eat. Eat.

436
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,800
Eunuch Cao,

437
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,450
the Emperor will be leaving for the capital this afternoon.

438
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,200
There are so many things needing your attention now.

439
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,600
You tell me, you aren't helping him but instead accompanying a bandit like me to drink some wine.

440
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,800
You're being too courteous.

441
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,600
As the saying goes, 'Everything in life is cyclical.'

442
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Right now, you aren't a bandit anymore.

443
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,400
You are the government's General Mighty.

444
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,000
If I still wait to treat you once you return to the capital,

445
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,350
I might have to wait for three days and three nights.

446
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,000
I just take the initiative to gain the upper hand.

447
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,390
I'm not interested in this General Mighty position.

448
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,770
That's right, too.

449
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,420
Just a measly Commanding General,

450
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,180
for a person with a status like you,

451
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,860
it indeed is nothing.

452
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,000
Did he tell you something?

453
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,700
His Majesty didn't tell me anything.

454
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,600
I was thinking about myself.

455
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,600
From the time I entered the palace... so many years have passed.

456
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,600
I accompanied His Majesty in braving through wind and rain.

457
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,000
I already saw a lot of different kinds of things.

458
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,400
But someone like you who claims to be of royal blood upon the first meeting,

459
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,800
it is really the first time.

460
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,510
I don't intend to make connections. I just want justice.

461
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,700
Let me give you some advice.

462
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,190
There are some things that even if they are true,

463
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,000
it is still better to just keep them a secret.

464
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,100
So many years have passed.

465
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,800
What do you want His Majesty to do?

466
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,320
Recognize a cousin like you who just fell from the sky?

467
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,200
How will people look at the royal family then?

468
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,700
Don't you think that there aren't enough troubles now?

469
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,600
What really do you mean?

470
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,700
I... I don't mean anything.

471
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,930
Is this some sort of Hongmen Banquet*?<br>(* a dinner where treachery was planned)

472
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,030
Why are you still here?

473
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,100
Qian Meng, you go first.

474
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,600
What are you doing?!

475
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Don't hurt other people.

476
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,600
Ma Da Dao, let's go.

477
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
Chase after them!

478
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,200
Stop there! Stop running!

479
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,470
Stop running!

480
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,200
Stop there! Go after them!

481
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,500
Stop running!

482
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,170
Your Majesty, it's getting late.

483
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,800
Let's set off.

484
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Go take a look where Ma Da Dao and Qian Qun went.

485
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,240
They clearly know that I'm leaving.

486
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,200
Why aren't they here to bid me farewell?

487
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,710
They don't observe formalities.

488
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,980
Just ignore them.

489
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,500
We'll just take our leave.

490
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,870
This won't do. Go and find them now.

491
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,400
I want to wait for them.

492
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,600
Your Majesty!

493
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Something bad has happened.

494
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Get up now. Tell me about it.

495
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,200
Your Majesty, save Ma Da Dao now.

496
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,400
Eunuch Cao wants to kill him.

497
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,750
Eunuch Cao, what's going on?

498
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,500
I... I...

499
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,250
Qian Xun, I should thank you.

500
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,200
If not, I would have lost my head.

501
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,820
Ma Da Dao, what grudges do you have with Eunuch Cao?

502
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,400
Why is he suddenly trying to kill you?

503
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,290
I don't have any grudges with him.

504
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,620
He is only carrying out a task for his master.

505
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,580
Are you referring to His Majesty?

506
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,350
You just saved His Majesty.

507
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,400
Moreover, you help him to close down Ding Song's residence.

508
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,100
He even trusted you and conferred you as a general.

509
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,560
This only happened recently

510
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,200
and he's going to kill you, right?

511
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,460
You can't totally blame him for this.

512
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,000
Blame me for being too naive instead.

513
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I told him my identity.

514
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,800
I thought he would take our blood relationship into account.

515
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,700
In the end, his desire for power was greater than anything else.

516
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,880
There is a rumor. You may have heard about it.

517
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,580
It's said that the previous King had a twin brother.

518
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,120
He died a violent death when he was young.

519
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,360
He left a child behind.

520
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,970
When the mother of that child went missing,

521
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,060
no one knew where that child went to, either.

522
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Have you heard about this?

523
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,600
Are you talking about...

524
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
you...

525
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,200
You don't believe it, right?

526
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,460
I guessed that you wouldn't believe it.

527
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,400
The rest doesn't believe it, either.

528
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,000
They think I'm a greedy person

529
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,800
who would make up any story for money and glory.

530
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Hence, I didn't even tell Qian Yi Shou about this.

531
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,200
I finally understand now,

532
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,800
the reason you hesitated when I asked you to save His Majesty.

533
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,000
And also the meaning behind what you said.

534
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,220
It's pointless for you to understand.

535
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,600
What can we change?

536
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,100
I only hope that he can keep his words,

537
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,670
correct his mistakes

538
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,300
and let the people live a good life.

539
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,640
What do you plan to do from now on?

540
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,340
What else can I plan?

541
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,800
I'm going to find a safe place.

542
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Qian Yun, let me tell you this.

543
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,670
Qian Yi Shou is not a bad person.

544
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,360
Fend for yourself.

545
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,250
No matter where he goes, he will come back and find you.

546
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:17,540
Keep yourself for him.

547
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,200
You really have guts.

548
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,140
You even dare to hurt General Mighty whom I conferred.

549
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,000
Do you know your mistake?

550
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,200
I think I didn't do anything wrong.

551
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Everything I did was for Your Majesty.

552
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,600
How dare you? Men!

553
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Give him twenty strokes of the paddles.

554
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Eunuch Cao has always been loyal to you.

555
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,400
He was with you during your most difficult moments.

556
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,900
Even if it's for old time's sake, you can't do this to him, either.

557
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,100
Your Majesty, be lenient.

558
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,890
Your Majesty, be lenient.

559
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,790
Eunuch Cao is too old to withstand the twenty strokes of beating.

560
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,390
Fine. Everyone is pleading on your behalf

561
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,170
and also that you have always been loyal to me.

562
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,300
I will spare you this time.

563
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

564
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your kindness.

565
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:43,030
This is bad. Looks like Ma Da Dao made a mistake about His Majesty.

566
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,050
So this is His Majesty, right?

567
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,400
He looks just like an ordinary person with nothing special.

568
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,830
Don't talk nonsense.

569
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,300
Be careful that he keeps you staying here as a eunuch.

570
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,600
Bai Ze, are the two next to you the descendents of the Heaven Strategy envoys?

571
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,000
Your Majesty, you are right.

572
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,800
This is Uncle Zhan Ke's son, Zhan Xiong Fei.

573
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,200
This is Uncle Yan Sang Lan's son, Yuan Shuai.

574
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,430
We risked our lives together to turn our misfortunes into blessings.

575
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,100
We are good friends now.

576
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,500
You are truly young heroes.

577
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,600
Miss Qian Yun has already told me about the both of you.

578
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:42,200
By the way, my younger sister didn't give you any troubles on the way here, right?

579
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,800
Older bro, how could you be so shortsighted always?

580
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Not only did I not give them any troubles on the way here, I even helped them.

581
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,000
Your Majesty...

582
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,300
Princess Zi Su did help us a lot on the way.

583
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,700
She even saved us a few times.

584
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,000
Looks like she has definitely improved over time.

585
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Fine, I will take back what I just said.

586
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,200
This is more like it.

587
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,200
It's just... that we have gotten the Magic Star from the Illuminati,

588
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,120
but it was taken away by Ma Shun eventually.

589
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,200
We have disappointed Your Majesty.

590
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,400
Lord Ding is a cunning devil.

591
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,200
Don't even talk about you, I also fell into his hands.

592
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,600
Fortunately, friends from Yanjiao Town helped me to escape.

593
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,800
I also just heard that Thirteenth Older Sis joined forces with Ma Da Dao to save Your Majesty.

594
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
This is really surprising.

595
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,600
This could be a blessing and protection from God.

596
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,930
Ding Song still hasn't been caught yet.

597
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,600
We must not lose our guard.

598
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,000
You are right.

599
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,200
Thus, I have issued an Imperial order to the palace guards to be extra vigilant and to be on strong defense.

600
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,680
There is something else.

601
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,600
Since you've inherited the burden of the Magic Star search from your fathers,

602
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,300
you should have a title.

603
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,000
Thus, I have decided to reinstate your title of Heaven Strategy envoy.

604
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,600
Of course, this can only be a secret now.

605
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,000
Once all the Magic Stars are collected, I'll announce to everyone.

606
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,500
- Thank you, Your Majesty.<br>- Thank you, Your Majesty.

607
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,200
Rise.

608
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,040
When I was imprisoned by Ding Song, the one who I missed most was you.

609
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,200
I remember when you first ran into the palace, you were only seven years old.

610
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,800
Yes, I remember.

611
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,000
At that time, Royal Father punished Nanny Tang who had been taking care of me.

612
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,400
At that time, I liked to feed and rear crows,

613
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,400
but Royal Father felt that it was unlucky to rear crows in the palace.

614
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,630
He didn't want me to rear them.

615
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,000
I secretly let Nanny Tang rear them in the Imperial Garden.

616
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,200
In the end, they were still discovered by him.

617
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,700
Hence, he kicked Nanny Tang out.

618
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,120
Subsequently, you were angry with Royal Father

619
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,600
and ran out of the palace alone.

620
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
I wonder how Nanny Tang is doing now.

621
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,600
She took care of me since I was young.

622
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,690
In this palace, other than you and Older Brother Bai Ze,

623
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,500
she was my closest family member.

624
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Let's not talk about this anymore.

625
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,400
When Royal Father was alive, he was especially strict with us.

626
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,510
He also did that out of good intentions.

627
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,600
Who told us to be born into a royal family.

628
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Older bro,

629
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,200
if you could be an ordinary man now,

630
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,800
but you can live happily forever, would you be willing?

631
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:52,050
