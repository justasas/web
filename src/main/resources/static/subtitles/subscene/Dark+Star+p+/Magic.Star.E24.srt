2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,700
Father! You are indeed here!

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,280
Are you alright? Father.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,490
Zhao Ran, you dare bully my father?!

5
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,790
See how dangerous I am!

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,040
- Xiong Fei!<br><i>- Child!</i>

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,510
- Are you alright?<br>- I'm fine.

8
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,220
Zhao Ran, you tell me why your complexion is so bad.

9
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,260
You tell me, did you get that old from being too angry?

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,450
You see how old your face is.

11
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,020
It's so old that we can't tell what your age is anymore.

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,170
- Are you around 100 years old already?<br>- Jeez,

13
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,800
Elder. Your face is full of wrinkles. So scary.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,430
Zhan Xiong Fei, you better not look at him.

15
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,740
Maybe it is contagious.

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,680
- It is even contagious?<br>- It's so disgusting.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,720
My god...

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,550
Your facial skin really looks so bad.

19
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,400
It almost looks like the old tree barks outside.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
You really need some good facial maintenance.

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,690
How about this, I'll teach you some maintenance techniques.

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,090
Or else, this aging of your face might kill you one day.

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,150
That's right.

24
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,500
You can't go out of your house if you are like that.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,580
If you go out, you'll scare people.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,550
You guys are still so young but you dared to go against me?

27
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,110
Today, I'll let you father and son die here!

28
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,380
Wow! Your creases can even talk!

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,540
Father, let's attack together and kill this wrinkled monster.

30
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,400
You tell me, do you think this labyrinth will collapse soon?

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,780
- Impossible.<br>- It's real.

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,950
Earlier, this ceiling almost--

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,720
Let's go. Let's follow them.

34
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,270
Let's go.

35
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,150
Elder Chang Ming... weren't you already...

36
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,910
No. I just lost all my power.

37
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,740
Right now, time is money. You hurry up to leave this place.

38
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,750
This place will soon disappear.

39
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,230
Respectfully greeting Elder.

40
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,320
Elder Chang Ming, hurry and save the Illuminati.

41
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,990
Hurry...

42
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,640
A Ji Ya, the Illuminati will never die.

43
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,040
Only bad people will perish.

44
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,440
Listen to me for now first.

45
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,820
Immediately leave this labyrinth first.

46
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,430
Elder...

47
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,330
- Older Bro Fei, Zi Su<br>- Bai Ze.

48
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,190
- Are you alright?<br>- We're fine.

49
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,800
That's good that you're fine.

50
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,680
You all came just in time.

51
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,440
Men! Arrest them all!

52
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:30,160
Elder Zhao Ran, you willfully changed the teachings of the Illuminati.

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,990
You are not worthy to lead the Illuminati.

54
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:41,510
Only I can become the real elder of the Illuminati right now.

55
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,730
Are you rebelling?

56
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,250
You are committing sins.

57
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,660
Whom among you...

58
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,030
really has the Magic Star?

59
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,210
If you don't tell me, I will have to use force.

60
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,120
Little brute!

61
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,680
Shut up!

62
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,120
Don't even think of treating me like a lackey of yours again.

63
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,630
Elder Zhao Ran, there are some things

64
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,640
that one should be paying back already!

65
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,100
Are you... Chang Ming?

66
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,070
Elder Chang Ming?

67
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,780
You all must hurry and leave this place,

68
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,030
including you, Elder Jiong Ye.

69
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,400
After leaving this place, just leave here to me.

70
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,390
You are still alive.

71
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,790
No. I can't be considered as being alive.

72
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,590
I already lost all my power.

73
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,380
But with my remaining energy, I can still open this box.

74
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,750
All of this will end here.

75
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,200
So you are the ultimate secret key for the Thousand Return Doors.

76
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,950
Father!

77
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,320
Father!

78
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,380
Father!

79
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,820
<i>Little Biao Zi, goodbye.</i>

80
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,340
<i>Let's play a finding the treasure game again one last time.</i>

81
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,920
<i>A Ji Ya, I can only pay what I owe you up to here.</i>

82
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,850
How did we end up here?

83
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,950
Hey, are you all alright?

84
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,530
I'm fine.

85
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,910
Good thing I didn't lose the Magic Star.

86
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,200
<i>Father!</i>

87
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,440
<i>Father!</i>

88
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,320
<i>Little Biao Zi, goodbye.</i>

89
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,550
<i>Let's play a finding the treasure game again one last time.</i>

90
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,160
<i>A Ji Ya, I can only pay back what I owe you up to here.</i>

91
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,650
- Zhan Xiong Fei! Where are you going?!<br>- Older Bro Fei!

92
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,670
- Xiong Fei!<br>- Zhan Xiong Fei!

93
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,250
Older Bro Fei!

94
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,260
Xiong Fei, what are you looking for?

95
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,660
My father said that he left me a finding the treasure game.

96
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,750
Older Bro Fei, let me help you find it together.

97
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
I found it.

98
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,960
Magic Star?

99
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,380
Father...

100
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,710
Father...

101
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,550
KoreanDramaX.co

102
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,930
My father said that the Magic Stars originally don't belong to the human world.

103
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,370
Why must he leave it to me?

104
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,310
Maybe just like what your father said, this is predestined.

105
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,990
Ma Shun respectfully greeting Your Lady Highness.

106
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,220
- A Ji Ya! <br>- A Ji Ya!

107
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,550
You are still not dead, A Ji Ya...

108
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,120
What you said was right.

109
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,270
They care about you very much.

110
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,590
This way, matters will be easier.

111
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,010
What Your Lady Highness said is right, A Ji Ya is indeed not yet dead.

112
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,680
But... she will die very soon.

113
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,410
Hey!

114
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,690
Let's make an exchange.

115
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,750
Use the two Magic Stars in your hands in exchange for the life of your one and only companion A Ji Ya.

116
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,360
This business deal is very fair and reasonable, right?

117
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,790
It's yours!

118
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,590
I never thought that it would be that easy.

119
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,260
But what if I'm going against my word now?

120
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,240
- Hey!<br>- You!

121
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,650
No need to panic that much. I was just joking.

122
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,920
Doing business must depend on trust.

123
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,790
I do still know that principle.

124
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,130
A Ji Ya, I won't kill you.

125
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,570
No need to thank me.

126
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,000
Hope to see you again next time.

127
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,390
<i>Go! Go!</i>

128
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,710
A Ji Ya!

129
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,370
Don't come near me!

130
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,480
Although I can't kill you right now,

131
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,930
I still can't forget this hatred.

132
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:13,470
Zi Su, these court beads were given by your father to the domain king.

133
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,040
A Ji Ya!

134
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,640
A Ji Ya, listen to me.

135
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,020
What else do you still want to say?

136
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,340
Everything that must be said has already been said.

137
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,800
Don't force me to kill you!

138
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,970
Can't the friendship that we developed in our journey really withstand a single blow?

139
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,870
Can't withstand a single blow?

140
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,590
If you tricked me, I could forgive you.

141
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,230
If you made me angry, I could also forgive you.

142
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,970
But your father killed my father.

143
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,400
Having such a huge grudge! How can I forgive you?!

144
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,690
A Ji Ya, the matter of our fathers,

145
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,290
why must we be the one to bear it?

146
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,290
Enough!

147
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,060
If we are not the ones who will bear it, who will?

148
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,320
Let me tell you. I hate you!

149
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,570
I hate you all!

150
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,060
Okay.

151
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,490
Okay. I won't say anything anymore.

152
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,020
No matter where you'll go, I won't care anymore.

153
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,270
But you must take this.

154
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,520
This is your father King Salin's personal adornment.

155
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,280
Hope it can bless you with blissfulness and happiness.

156
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,750
I don't want these court beads.

157
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,610
In your eyes, this is a royal grant.

158
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,020
But in my eyes, it is hatred and pain.

159
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,840
Whatever it had represented in the past isn't important.

160
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,170
But it now represents the care that we your friends have for you.

161
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:22,590
I will never forget the first time I saw you.

162
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,700
Your smile is deeply carved in my heart.

163
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,490
What's the use of saying these things now?

164
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,560
I will never remember them.

165
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,600
I have already forgotten them.

166
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,890
You have forgotten.

167
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,110
But I won't forget.

168
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,880
In my heart, it is already deeply and stably rooted.

169
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,850
Unless time could go back and I chose not to meet you.

170
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:55,010
If time could go back, I wouldn't give you that bread.

171
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,730
If time could really go back,

172
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,840
I would surely stop my father and not let him do those--

173
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,050
Enough!

174
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,320
In this world, there isn't that many "if's."

175
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,040
You are also being too naive.

176
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,240
From now on, you look after your own concern

177
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,670
and leave me to my own affairs.

178
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,510
Hope to see you again in the future.

179
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,940
Hope we won't see each other again.

180
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,670
Forgive me for not being able to see you off

181
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,780
because I don't want the last image in my heart

182
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,150
to be your back while you are leaving me.

183
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,890
Xiong Fei...

184
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,480
Don't be like this...

185
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,980
If you are sad,

186
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,650
just say it.

187
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,090
You keeping it to yourself and not talking like this

188
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,090
is really making us all worried.

189
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,580
Zi Su,

190
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,160
when I was little, this was how my father left me.

191
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,870
How come the same thing must happen to me twice?

192
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,510
Why? Why?

193
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,750
Xiong Fei.

194
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,980
I know.

195
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,570
We all know.

196
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,740
Elder Jiong Ye...

197
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,760
your father, is such an adorable person.

198
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,630
You both lived alone for the past ten plus years.

199
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,890
It wasn't easy for you two to have finally reunited.

200
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,640
But for us...

201
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,960
I know that your heart is sad, Xiong Fei.

202
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,010
How come the one who died, isn't me?

203
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,540
Zhan Xiong Fei! Don't say things like that.

204
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,900
Even if... Even if you kill yourself now,

205
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,690
your father won't be able to come back anymore.

206
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,990
Zi Su...

207
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,160
I wasn't able to protect my father.

208
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,830
I wasn't able to protect the Magic Stars.

209
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,220
If you encounter any disaster in the future,

210
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,450
I won't also be able to protect you.

211
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,630
I can't even protect the things that I want to protect.

212
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,940
What's the use of me still living?

213
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,020
- What's the use of me living?<br>- Your spouting nonsense.

214
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,660
Of course, your life has meaning.

215
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,010
You still have to become a hero who shares his blessings

216
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,400
and takes responsibilities for hardships.

217
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,180
Moreover...

218
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,850
we all are living well.

219
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,590
Who needs your protection?

220
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,420
As long as you understand what I mean, that's good.

221
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,410
I'm going to find the Magic Stars.

222
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,470
Where are you going?

223
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,960
I'm going to find the Magic Stars.

224
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,080
Move aside!

225
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,610
Such an important matter,

226
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,360
you think it's something that will come true just because you say so?!

227
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,230
Bai Ze, stop lecturing me!

228
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,310
Move aside!

229
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,850
Stop being stubborn already!

230
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,070
Let me tell you. We are sad too that Elder Jiong Ye died.

231
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,840
You can be sad, throw tantrums, and be stubborn here!

232
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,060
But if you are just going to have yourself killed for nothing,

233
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,640
I will never allow it!

234
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,800
Bai Ze, stop being opinionated!

235
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,250
Move aside!

236
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,240
Not moving aside!

237
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,990
Right now is not the time for you to try to be a hero! Do you know that?!

238
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,660
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

239
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,740
Older Brother Bai Ze, you stop fighting!

240
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,760
Don't fight anymore...

241
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,460
Zhan Xiong Fei! Bai Ze! You stop fighting!

242
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,720
- Stop fighting.<br>- Does anyone want to eat some corn?

243
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,730
What are you doing?

244
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,540
Hey... Hey...

245
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,180
What happened?

246
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,960
Yu!

247
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,780
Big Bros, do you guys have water? Can you give me some?

248
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,310
We have. Go give her some water.

249
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,180
Thank you. Thank you.

250
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,070
Miss, why are you traveling alone here in the Gobi desert?

251
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,620
I can see that you didn't bring any luggage or equipment, either.

252
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,640
That shouldn't be.

253
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,290
Where do you plan to go?

254
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,250
I am going home.

255
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:50,830
The Helan Meadows is my home.

256
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,610
Oh... Then does it mean... that you're also from the Helan tribe?

257
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,660
Heaven bless you.

258
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,160
Heaven bless you.

259
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,060
Miss, how long have you not been in your hometown?

260
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,350
Probably 10 years already.

261
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:15,440
Then you don't know what our present hometown looks like now.

262
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,670
Since 10 years ago during the death of King Salin,

263
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,410
the tribe got ruled by a subordinate of King Salin called A Lamusi.

264
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,510
He called himself the Helan King.

265
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,920
Helan King?

266
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,360
We people in the grasslands all revere the Helan God.

267
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,970
No one ever had the nerve to call himself Helan King.

268
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,640
Right. This Helan King has very huge ambitions

269
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,350
but he is really very ordinary.

270
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,160
- It's already getting dark. We have to continue with our journey.<br>- Thank you.

271
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,810
Miss, take that.

272
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,670
I wish you good fortune.

273
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,610
Heaven bless you.

274
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,010
Heaven bless you.

275
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,580
Buddies, we have to continue our travel now!

276
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,670
Set out!

277
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,740
Let's go now.

278
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,590
Hurry and come in. It's time to eat.

279
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,770
Why are you so slow?

280
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,000
That... I have something to report.

281
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Today, a friend who doesn't want him to be named,

282
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,810
asked me to relay a message to his other friend.

283
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,550
He had hit quite hard earlier

284
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,480
and said quite hurtful words.

285
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,100
He feels very sorry.

286
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,270
And another one, another friend who doesn't want to be named, either,

287
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,330
asked me to tell his other friend

288
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,520
that what he did earlier was also quite excessive.

289
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,510
And then... Jeez, can you two just say it?

290
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,260
Two grown men, can you resolve your problem by yourselves?

291
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,530
I won't mind you two anymore. I am eating now.

292
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,000
- That...<br>- That...

293
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,900
Earlier, I indeed was very rash.

294
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,920
I was also quite rash.

295
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,590
My language was also quite excessive.

296
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,780
My punches were quite heavy.

297
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,290
It was indeed quite heavy.

298
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,890
It still hurts up to now.

299
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,280
But I didn't punch you lightly, either.

300
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,320
Are you alright?

301
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,860
I'm fine.

302
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,730
Alrihgt. Alright. We all are still friends.

303
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,610
Me too. Me too.

304
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,210
Okay.

305
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,250
- Okay.<br>- Okay now.

306
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,360
Alright. Alright. Let's go to the next topic of discussion now.

307
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,750
What topic of discussion?

308
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,470
What do we do next?

309
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,470
I don't know what to do next.

310
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,530
I just want to know how A Ji Ya is doing now.

311
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,360
Right now, we weren't able to accomplish anything.

312
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,810
If we go back to the capital just like this, how embarrassing would that be?

313
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,260
But if we don't go back, we won't be able to get any new clues.

314
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:03,060
When we just arrived at Guangming Town, I sent His Majesty a secret message.

315
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:08,820
If nothing bad happens, we should receive the reply from the capital soon.

316
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,480
You tell me why must the grudges of the past generations

317
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,120
be passed on to us?

318
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,350
Could it be that we must inherit the hatred and grudges?

319
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,890
All of these were not our mistakes to begin with.

320
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,480
It wasn't us who instigated our fathers

321
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,750
to do those things.

322
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,450
Older Bro Bai Ze, say something.

323
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,920
About the matters of our fathers, we aren't fit to make any comments, either.

324
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,450
Anyway, A Ji Ya will never be returning.

325
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,800
I feel that if it was me,

326
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,120
just taking the Star Chart away is just a light punishment.

327
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,340
Since A Ji Ya took the star chart away now,

328
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,590
she even knows how to read it,

329
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,820
so then the person who will gather the Magic Stars next most likely will be A Ji Ya.

330
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:06,480
I instead feel that this Star Chart is A Ji Ya's greatest source of danger.

331
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,680
Huh? What should we do now?

332
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,560
Should we just continue to wait like this?

333
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,660
Or else, do you have any good idea?

334
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,720
I... Oh...

335
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,280
Let's go.

336
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,610
Go.

337
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:39,020
KoreanDramaX.co

338
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,090
Black Magic Star.

339
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,810
We are able to get it without wasting any effort.

340
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,800
Oh, my...

341
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,380
What is going on?

342
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,480
He is too heavy.

343
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,860
Hurry and come over here to help out.

344
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,420
Let's go.

345
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,790
Looks like Ding Song and Ma Shun

346
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,850
and his subordinates

347
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,620
have gathered in the Royal Palace.

348
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,270
He is also quite at ease. Playing some empty city strategy here.

349
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,280
He is quite magnanimous.

350
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,760
Right now, since we are already here,

351
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,970
we can't just leave without making some noise.

352
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,200
This way, it would be too kind to that evil Ding Song.

353
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,650
We should leave him some traces of our might.

354
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,760
No.

355
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,760
Why?

356
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,970
This is a rare opportunity.

357
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,140
If we miss this,

358
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,690
it will be hard for us to have another chance like this.

359
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,790
Doing that now is just for a moment of happiness,

360
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,670
but it'll alarm the enemies. The loss outweighs the gain.

361
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,780
And also, His Majesty is still in their hands right now.

362
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,850
We first better think of a way to save His Majesty.

363
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,550
Right. Right. I agree.

364
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,390
Hey!

365
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,090
You really do have such a sturdy body.

366
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,460
Wake up this fast.

367
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,760
Walk on your own!

368
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,230
So many imperial guards.

369
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,820
Looks like we can only use the strategy of besieging Wei to save Zhao.

370
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,960
Let's act separately.

371
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,370
How about this, Ma Da Dao?

372
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,730
Qian Xun and I will cover for you and you just charge into the prison directly.

373
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,780
Let's go.

374
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,030
Who are you?! Who are you?!

375
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,050
Let's go!

376
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,860
Is something happening outside?!

377
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,030
It is probably nothing.

378
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,210
Be at ease.

379
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,970
We should just focus on guarding this place.

380
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,310
Don't mind other things.

381
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,310
We just mainly need to keep watch of these two old men.

382
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,690
Don't let any mishaps occur.

383
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,400
Who?

384
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,380
Your Majesty, could there be something going on outside?

385
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,320
Could it be Ding Song has already found the Magic Star and he is here to get rid of us?

386
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,460
- Who are you?!<br>- What are you planning to do?!

387
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,700
I am here to save you two.

388
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,140
- Who are you?<br>- I am just some measly thief.

389
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,860
Come with me! Come with me!

390
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,700
Hurry, Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

391
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,620
<i>[Ding Residence]</i>

392
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,630
Lord.

393
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,760
Something bad has happened.

394
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,570
Last night, the Royal Palace suddenly caught fire.

395
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,100
A few assassins rescued both His Majesty and Eunuch Cao from the prison during the chaos.

396
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,440
I can't take you with me anymore.

397
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,220
Every time I see you, I remember him.

398
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,870
I really hate myself.

399
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,900
How come I keep remembering him?

400
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,620
A Ji Ya, he is your enemy for your father's death.

401
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,130
He is the descendant of your father's killer!

402
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,700
Can't you have a bit of backbone?!

403
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,530
You can't be soft hearted anymore.

404
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,420
You must forget him.

405
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,000
Why?

406
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,380
Why?!

407
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,890
Why?!

408
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,120
Don't be like this!

409
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,250
This will cause your wounds to gape open.

410
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:36,310
Anyway, you have already rescued the Emperor.

411
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:38,860
Why are you still wasting time to save me?

412
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,890
Don't say words like that.

413
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,010
As for His Majesty, I will plead to him in your behalf

414
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,930
and let him forgive your crimes.

415
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,540
I know that... you were just used by Ding Song.

416
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,390
Qian Meng,

417
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,700
you still care about me.

418
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,880
Let's go.

419
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,660
The medicine most likely has finished brewing.

420
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,540
Go back with me.

421
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,950
His Majesty!

422
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:15,100
Isn't she the lady boss of Casual Guests' Inn in Yanjiao Town?

423
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,490
How come you're also here?

424
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,560
- I...<br>- What do you mean by 'how come she's also here'?

425
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,860
Last night, if not because of her, Qian Yi Shou and I wouldn't have helped to save you.

426
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,330
You must thank her very well.

427
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,510
Ma Da Dao, don't talk out of place.

428
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,010
We still haven't formally greeted His Majesty.

429
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,810
No need. No need.

430
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,050
What Ma Da Dao said is right.

431
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,520
Right now, you all are my saviors.

432
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,480
Where is Qian Yi Shou?

433
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,520
He is a weird person.

434
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,950
He doesn't want to see Your Majesty no matter what.

435
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,150
Maybe he is worried about Your Majesty blaming him for trying to assassinate you before.

436
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,720
An ignorant person is innocent.

437
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,670
Moreover, last time, I was in disguise.

438
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,550
Why would I blame him?

439
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,020
Hey, Your Majesty, look. The three of us already saved you.

440
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,890
What do you plan to do next?

441
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,380
Of course, it is to eliminate the Ding Song's group,

442
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,320
return to the capital again, and then attend the court to listen to government matters.

443
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,360
Have you finished?

444
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,030
I'm done.

445
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,060
- Did I ask you?<br>- You...

446
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,630
What Eunuch Cao is right.

447
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,020
The most important matter right now is to return to the capital and eliminate Ding Song.

448
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,690
From what I know, when General Su was still alive, you already said that you wanted to eliminate Ding Song.

449
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,600
But this thing never happened.

450
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,580
Now that you have fallen into this state, you don't even have any army,

451
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,520
why is it you still speak so arrogantly?

452
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,060
Ma Da Dao.

453
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,130
Your Majesty, he is just a boor.

454
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,960
- He doesn't know how to speak properly.<br>- Who is a boor?

455
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,800
You must not bother with him.

456
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,640
You say...

457
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,620
Ma Da Dao, go to the kitchen and take a look

458
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,530
if the food for His Majesty is already done.

459
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,890
- Go.<br>- Sure.

460
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,370
He is so not giving His Majesty any respect!

461
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,400
If we were in the palace-

462
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,370
Eunuch Cao,

463
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,980
this is not the palace.

464
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,810
We are on someone else's territory now.

465
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,870
Miss Qian Xun, this time I really have to thank you properly.

466
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,730
Your Majesty, you still have to properly thank one person.

467
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:27,080
If not for her rushing to get help, we wouldn't have even known something happened to you.

468
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,620
Oh?

469
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:58,090
