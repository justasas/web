1
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,400
Movie premiere?

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,730
One university seonbae has 
became a film director.
(Seonbae - Senior in college, school or work)

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,570
It's an invitation letter but 
there is a VIP reception.
(Seonbae - Senior in college, school or work)

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,510
for interacting with the director 
prior to premiere.
(Seonbae - Senior in college, school or work)

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,530
You have a film director 
amongst your seonbaes?

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,410
Yes, he always had a camera during school days.
He was bound to become one.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,620
What movie is it?

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,030
"Intro to Civil Engineering"?

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,500
Intro to Civil Engineering?

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,520
I had seen that advertisement.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,090
That movie seems to be rather so so...

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,290
- Mother. I want to see the movie too.
- Me too! Me too!

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,490
You guys can't. You can't watch an adults' movie.

14
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,590
What's an adults' movie?

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:45,100
A movie where man and woman 
kiss a lot, that's an adult's movie.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,300
Kissing too much will cause tooth decay.

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,770
You know what?

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,440
If you watch the stars with an open mouth for
an hour at night, you won't get tooth decay.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,300
I checked into it.

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,090
Shut up! Red Sun.

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,840
It's true, you know!

22
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,080
What happens when DNA test 
results are out tomorrow?

23
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,850
What the hell have you done these 2 days?
You still haven't gone inside the room?

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,420
Last night I went in and searched for a while, 
but it isn't there.

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,260
Searched a while and it isn't there?

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,090
Where's your sense of responsibility?

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,200
You need to keep looking till it's brought out!

28
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,130
How can a young guy be
so lacking in a sense of justice?

29
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,250
You don't want the money?
If successful, you get 10 million Wons.
(~US$ 8500)

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,900
Not worked up? Only I'm worked up? Only I am?

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,610
I understand.

32
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,580
Tonight is the final chance. Don't forget.

33
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,250
Together, we will punish those evil forces.

34
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,810
They are not so bad to be
called evil forces, are they?

35
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,380
Oh yeah? Look what you are saying now!

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,950
Since you are finessing it for them,
you are growing close, right?

37
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,790
You don't even know how bad they are.

38
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,890
How bad are they?

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,350
What do you mean, how bad?

40
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,030
Listen properly. To say how bad they are...

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,960
Forget it. 
Fine, I'll say just this much.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,260
They are so bad that it's so tough to be 
so bad as to be as bad as them!

43
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,000
Understand?

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,940
So tonight, without fail find the USB.
Understand?

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,070
But can I ask you just one thing?

46
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,540
What?

47
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,480
What happened to their real son?

48
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,260
The theater itself has a third-rate feel.

49
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,100
No such talk when we meet him, okay?

50
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,660
No Bo Yeong!

51
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,130
Seonbae.

52
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,270
You are really just the same as in those days!

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,740
No, may be you got even younger?

54
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,940
Come on, I'm an ajumma too now.
(Ajumma - old lady, aunt)

55
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,410
Anyway, congrats on becoming a director!

56
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,880
This is my husband.

57
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,810
Hello. I'm Gim Do Sang.

58
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,480
To actually meet a film director like this...
It's an honor.

59
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,260
It's you who is here to watch it.
I'm really happy!

60
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,460
Of course I must come to see. 
Whose movie is it after all?

61
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,450
The other guys?

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,500
Not yet. Hey if you're here,
that's enough, no?

63
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,600
<i>Director.</i>

64
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,430
One moment.

65
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,270
I have to go. Let's catch-up later.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,470
We'll be enjoying the film.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,040
Why only a nod towards me?

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,970
Had I known it, I too would've only nodded.

69
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,680
Director, we hear that this movie
is your autobiography.

70
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:17,780
Is that true?

71
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,290
Yes, a large part was from my personal
experiences. You can say that.

72
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,960
On the creation of the movie, we can't avoid 
mentioning its connection to memories.

73
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,530
May I ask you what that would imply?

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,100
Tough to say...

75
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,240
Don't certain songs lead to special 
memories with certain people?

76
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,010
Me as well, as I hear something memorable,
I'll automatically think of those times.

77
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,480
Perhaps that is what it means?

78
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,350
Differently from other 'first love' movies,
a lot of kissing scenes are there, it seems?

79
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,180
The first time one falls in love,

80
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,120
is there anything but kissing?
Was I the only one like that?

81
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,060
Right on, really.

82
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,630
Sure sounds logical. Since we are on this topic...

83
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,830
may be we would want to 
listen to those stories?

84
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,860
You went out somewhere?

85
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,700
What about you? Going to the loo?

86
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,000
Stop worrying. I haven't used 
more than 5 pieces of tissues.

87
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,410
You sure? Seeing that fishy look, you must've
wasted many rounds of tissues.

88
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,610
Already like a house-owner?

89
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,810
Test results will be out tomorrow, right?

90
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,380
It's the night before your fate gets set.

91
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,220
You must be very nervous?

92
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,420
- No. 
- Like you aren't!

93
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,360
If you are the real son, you know you have to
buy me rib-eye steaks, right?

94
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,940
Since it will be released tomorrow morning,
why can't you tell us now?

95
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,140
Just because it's Sunday, 
it's so hard to take a peek?

96
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,610
Why is this hospital like this?

97
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,540
Other hospitals only take 1 day,
but you take 3 days.

98
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,640
You're here?

99
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,740
Yes.

100
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,580
It's fine.

101
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,050
Sit down.

102
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,980
You're here?

103
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,450
My waist is all healed.

104
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,920
How could it?

105
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,390
He had an injection.

106
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,590
It's all thanks to you that it has healed, I think.

107
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,530
This kid massaged me with lots of care.

108
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,930
When I had my body bath 2 days ago, 
he didn't even sleep and kept me company.

109
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,500
Should I trying carrying you now?

110
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,340
You need to get completely healed.

111
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,540
I said I'm completely healed. See this.

112
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,210
Hey, hey, hey. Stop it, or you'll get hurt again.

113
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,040
Hurt? What hurt?

114
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,610
- Are you all right?
- Father!

115
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,380
Just teasing you!

116
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,790
The for-ever grouchy grandfather has 
suddenly turned naughty since you came.

117
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,460
You rascal, calling a 90 years old father
a naughty kid makes sense?

118
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,290
Wasn't that a good thing I said?

119
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,140
This is an autobiographical movie?
Really crappy!

120
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,600
Keep quiet.

121
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,910
<i>Those are the times that create memories?
What the hell...</i>

122
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,840
I too like memory creation so much.

123
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,050
I too have songs that contain memories.

124
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,980
All those good songs are now ruined! 
Ah, damn it!

125
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,290
You better stop it now...

126
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,340
Is that what a movie is?

127
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,560
Even I can film something better than that.

128
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,790
But, whom are you chatting with 
since a while back?

129
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,260
That director seonbae.

130
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,830
When I said I enjoyed the movie, 
he asked me back for a drink.

131
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,930
What drink?

132
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,870
Directors should film good movies.
This one was like dog shit.

133
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,700
I asked you to give it a rest!

134
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,540
What movie-criticism is this?
Longer than even the movie...

135
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,370
I mean, a movie should at least
have the basics--

136
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,570
I'm sleepy. Don't talk to me.

137
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,180
=Ever since the asteroid appeared,=
=violent crime rates have risen by 40%.=

138
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,000
=The problem of a Judgment Day cult=
=religion forming is serious as well.=

139
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,890
=This time, due to rumors that the asteroids'=
=infrared rays are beneficial to health,=

140
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,190
=haven't there been more people taking= 
=nude asteroid-light baths at night?=

141
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,860
=Yes, it's correct. It we go to=
=the Han River banks at night,=

142
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,830
=people who have stripped naked, and= 
=all spread out, is a common sight.=

143
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,370
=Is it that even underwear aren't worn?=

144
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,570
=The majority aren't wearing them.=

145
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,340
=Presumably it's due to the rumor that the faint=
=infrared rays are very good for them.=

146
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,010
The world is getting weirder with these 
total crazies everywhere or what?

147
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,810
Can't say you're wrong.

148
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,780
<i>You found it?</i>

149
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,450
<i>Not yet.</i>

150
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,650
I'm off to sleep.

151
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,860
Have a good night.

152
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,850
But, the test result will be out tomorrow?

153
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

154
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,300
This kid is Jun Hyeok, for sure.

155
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,170
I just know it all.

156
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,470
I'm retiring too.

157
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,280
See you... tomorrow.

158
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,810
<i>For the DNA test results come out, it will take
a few days, over the weekend.</i>

159
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,870
<i>While you enjoy the life of the rich till then,</i>

160
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,580
<i>help me with this one thing on the side.</i>

161
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,520
<i>You earn money, and you do a good deed.</i>

162
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,620
<i>How about it?</i>

163
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,290
<i>You are Jun Hyeok, am I right?</i>

164
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,160
<i>Alone all these years...
How scary and difficult it must've been!</i>

165
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,100
<i>I am sorry for not finding you.</i>

166
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,930
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

167
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,170
<i>The real son is already dead.</i>

168
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,640
<i>Even then they keep looking.</i>

169
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,310
<i>Those nasty people are a terror,
sticking with it for that son.</i>

170
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,550
<i>If you come like now as if nothing happened, to 
stay by me like nothing happened, it'll be nice.</i>

171
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,860
<i>By chance if you are that real son,
then treat me to some good beef!</i>

172
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,690
<i>Rib-eye steak.</i>

173
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,530
<i>I haven't had it even once.</i>

174
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,060
<i>This sure feels strange.</i>

175
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,360
<i>3rd rate films. Eclectic films. Nonsensical films.</i>

176
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,560
<i>The No Bo Yeong who hates
those 3 types of films,</i>

177
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,240
<i>doesn't have a word to say about
a film that fits all 3 types.</i>

178
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,170
<i>Just because the director is a seonbae?</i>

179
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,320
<i>Is that all it is?</i>

180
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,150
<i>It's you who is here to watch it.
I'm really happy!</i>

181
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,900
<i>Of course I must come to see. 
Whose movie is it after all?</i>

182
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,450
<i>If you're here, that's enough, no?</i>

183
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,520
Coffee!

184
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,360
What's it? Ping pong?

185
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,130
Don't change it. Isn't it fun to watch?
I took part in the ping pong team in college.

186
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,800
<i>Strangely, I find engineering grads cool.
Like civil engineers.</i>

187
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,840
<i>They build bridges, and roads!
Don't they seem high-scale?</i>

188
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,770
<i>You mean this is all coincidental?</i>

189
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,240
<i>Wait a moment.</i>

190
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,280
<i>Now that I see it, earlier the
the female lead was called...</i>

191
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,320
<i>Pak Yeong Hui
Pak Yeong Hui...</i>

192
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,520
<i>Ba Yeong Hui.</i>

193
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,920
<i>Ba Yeong-i... 
Bo Yeong-i ????</i>

194
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,490
That... Son of a bitch!

195
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,070
<i>The first time I went on a trip with her...
Was it to Cheongju?</i>

196
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,380
<i>Attorney Gim's hometown is Cheongju?
I didn't know that.</i>

197
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,840
<i>Cheongju is beautiful.</i>

198
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,290
<i>Cheongju is beautiful, she said.</i>

199
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,860
<i>No Bo Yeong, who is a 3rd-generation
Seoul city dweller...</i>

200
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,420
<i>For her to have gone to Cheongju...</i>

201
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,360
<i>If that's the case...</i>

202
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,300
<i>With that bastard?...</i>

203
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,940
<i>In that trip, I only remember
kissing the entire day.</i>

204
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,480
<i>We kissed as we walked.</i>

205
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,230
<i>And kept kissing, getting into a van.</i>

206
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,370
<i>Our lips not separating for the entire day
was beautiful, I think.</i>

207
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,670
That damn son of a bitch!

208
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,970
What is the sound?

209
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,180
It's nothing.

210
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,640
Not sleeping?

211
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,850
Yeah, sleeping.

212
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,780
Hey, but... You...

213
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,820
Nevermind.

214
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,590
That damn son of a bitch.

215
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,570
<i>It can't be, right? Could she...</i>

216
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,770
<i>Yes, it just can't be.</i>

217
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,600
<i>It's not so.</i>

218
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,910
<i>Jun Hyeok!</i>

219
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,880
<i>Jun Hyeok!</i>

220
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,650
Jun Hyeok!

221
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,250
Jun Hyeok!

222
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,040
Jun Hyeok.

223
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,820
You boy...

224
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,130
Father!

225
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,130
The test results say it's true.

226
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,600
Our Jun Hyeok.

227
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,700
Isn't it? Correct, right?

228
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,170
Didn't I already say it's correct?

229
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,740
You rascal fellow... You rascal.

230
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,200
Test result came out this early in the morning?

231
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,410
It's your dad who called ahead to confirm.

232
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,440
Su Yeong. Your younger brother Jun Hyeok
has come back. Say hello.

233
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,910
He's been here for a few days.

234
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,850
Regardless, Jun Hyeok. 
I really missed you.

235
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,820
Honey... Our Jun Hyeok. The one we 
missed day and night for 20 years.

236
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,020
So sorry for these few days.

237
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,490
No...

238
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,800
I am sorry.

239
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,900
That's right.

240
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,670
Mom had got hurt many times in the past
after getting her hopes up. That's why.

241
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,610
What are we doing on such a joyous day?
We must celebrate!

242
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,900
Let's have a celebration party! 
Celebration party!

243
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,060
Grandfather, it's 6 am in the morning.
What celebration party?

244
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,300
Does the time matter for a celebration party?

245
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,310
Call over people! Call over everybody!

246
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,520
The more people, the better for a celebration.

247
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,720
Let's just celebrate nicely among 
just us, father-in-law.

248
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,820
Ajumma.

249
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,020
This woman!

250
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,960
Aigoo, this rascal.

251
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,890
What happened here?

252
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,990
What do you think happened?

253
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,830
Out of no choice, I had to make some moves.

254
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,300
You hurry up and find the USB.

255
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,770
What 'moves'?

256
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,600
Isn't this a crime?

257
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,640
Is being there instead of a dead son
some crime? It's a good deed.

258
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,210
The way that family thinks,
even if we say you are not,

259
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,370
I reckon they will deceive themselves 
into believing you are the son anyway.

260
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,710
Hold on, hold on, just listen to me.

261
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,380
If you are that reluctant, it's enough to
just confess it once you find the USB.

262
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,320
You do fit that family's specifications on 
the missing person and that isn't a lie.

263
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,360
You don't know about the test results, 
so you have no responsibility in that.

264
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,560
Do you get what I'm talking about?

265
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,390
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

266
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,600
<i>Find that USB fast.</i>

267
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,410
<i>Jun Hyeok.</i>

268
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,340
No Jun Hyeok.

269
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:48,950
Yes.

270
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,520
- Jin A!
- What?

271
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,990
Jin A!

272
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,450
What? What?

273
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,860
The youngster is really the son.

274
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,960
What?

275
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,630
The youngter... is that... family's real son, yes.

276
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,090
Is it so?

277
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,500
See that! I had... told you to bite him, right?

278
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,110
No, no. Now that the groundwork is set, 
at least from now on... That's it!

279
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,040
You too get mentally prepared
at least from now.

280
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,980
This... for us, is an opportunity.
Understand?

281
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,750
Whatever, please don't be like this!

282
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,650
You are the one who shouldn't be like this.

283
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,490
This is an opportunity, an opportunity.

284
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,420
They say an opportunity is a 'chance'.
You won't know it?

285
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,990
Mom, 'chance' means opportunity in english.

286
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,000
Isn't that what I was saying?

287
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,730
An opportunity is a chance.

288
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,500
Don't miss the chance, Jin A.

289
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,540
Excuse me, I'm here.

290
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,100
- Oh, come on in, come on.
- Your daughter?

291
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,840
She's at work.

292
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,770
This type of celebration, and you 
invited even me. Thank you.

293
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,710
Right now, I feel like having a 
3-month celebration party.

294
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,650
Yes, of course. Where do you find
such a happy occasion?

295
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,420
Wondering what if the youngster isn't the 
real son, I was also so badly worrying.

296
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,250
I couldn't even get sleep last night.

297
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,090
Ajumma, why wouldn't you get sleep?

298
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,760
Well... Oh, do you need any help?

299
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,330
Jun Hyeok.

300
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,800
Uncle.

301
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,740
<i>Exceptional dance, I must say!</i>

302
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,410
Having fun like this, the afternoon time flies!

303
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,960
Oh, it's the seal nuna!
(Nuna - Elder sisier, elder girl)

304
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,790
- Come on in. 
- Come on in, come on.

305
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,890
<i>Come and sit down.</i>

306
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,560
What are you doing?

307
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,030
Let go.

308
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,600
<i>Come, sit down. Sit down.</i>

309
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,740
<i>Come, sit down. Sit.</i>

310
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,280
How can the lead actor sit outside like this?

311
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,760
I'm sorry, but can I do a celebration ritual?

312
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,880
When we see baseball, the home run hitters
get a good dose of something!

313
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,610
Can I do it just this once?

314
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,020
I will, okay?

315
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,960
Cowabanga, dude!

316
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,530
Why no reaction, like this?

317
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,470
Ah, right! You better not forget about
buying me rib-eye steaks.

318
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,600
If you don't wish to be a 
rich kid, recently deceased.

319
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,570
Come to think of it, the name is kinda nice.

320
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,070
Of what?

321
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,540
Rib-eye steak, I mean.

322
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,600
Is it because there's an eye, like a flower?

323
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,660
Rib-eye steak.

324
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,330
Rib-eye steak...

325
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,090
Rib-eye steak!

326
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,390
Not only is the name pleasant...

327
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,550
but the smell must be great too, right?

328
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,630
Why do you look like that? 
Since a while back?

329
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:27,330
Towards what, and where to
let myself carry on, and how...

330
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,800
isn't very clear.

331
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,820
What are you talking about?

332
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,100
Turned rich, and you're already all smug?

333
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,940
Doesn't suit you, okay?

334
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,980
I've seen you in all kinds of shit before,
and you get picky with words now?

335
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,650
<i>Jun Hyeok, where did you go?</i>

336
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,220
Dad. Quickly bring Jun Hyeok to visit Min Hyeok.

337
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,560
Min Hyeok has been looking
for Jun Hyeok for a while.

338
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,390
Okay, I'm hanging up.

339
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,420
You going out somewhere?

340
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,800
- Yeah, a party.
- Party?

341
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,830
What party?

342
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,200
That "Intro to Civil Engineering" seonbae is 
throwing it, as the movie made it to no.1.

343
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,670
What? The movie is a no. 1 hit?

344
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,240
"One Same Vegas" is that place where
we had an earlier get-together, right?

345
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,540
Yeah. There, well... 
You really must go?

346
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,850
My schoolmates will all be there.
I'll just go, show my face and return.

347
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,410
What's the point in just going to show the face?

348
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,720
Why all this interrogation? 
I just have to go, so I will go.

349
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,290
There's salad and sandwiches in the fridge.

350
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,120
Don't forget to feed the boys.

351
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,730
Why? You changing into this?

352
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,830
Yeah, this feels a bit too dark.

353
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,400
Go out. I want to change.

354
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,470
You going somewhere?

355
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,230
I want to take Jun Hyeok to the 
hospital to visit Min Hyeok.

356
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,380
Jun Hyeok.

357
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,360
Yes.

358
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,570
He will be extremely happy to see you.

359
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,660
Even as kids, he liked you a lot
and took you out to play.

360
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,830
Yes.

361
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,340
<i>What's this small small rise of uneasy feeling
that I keep getting?</i>

362
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,280
<i>A suspicious party, out of the blue.</i>

363
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,140
<i>A red one-piece dress.</i>

364
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,680
<i>My suspicion the day before must be correct.</i>

365
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,150
<i>That dog-like...</i>

366
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,480
<i>Dad.</i>

367
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,900
<i>Dad!</i>

368
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,470
Dad!!

369
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,860
Why are you shaking your legs?

370
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,380
Dad, if you keep shaking your legs,
this will shake too, you know.

371
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,360
Sorry.

372
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,600
<i>Correct. Buried deep... Buried deep...</i>

373
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,810
<i>everybody has a past, don't they all?</i>

374
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,380
<i>But a party today?</i>

375
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,310
Dad! Why do you keep shaking?

376
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,880
Dad, don't shake your leg.

377
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,720
This will get shaken!

378
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,320
<i>But yes. It's not like it's a solo meeting with him.</i>

379
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,520
<i>Won't all the schoolmates be there?</i>

380
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,860
<i>Moreover, it is the No Bo Yeong who
beheads those she can see through.</i>

381
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,760
<i>But what if that fellow keeps 
making his moves...</i>

382
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,210
<i>No Bo Yeong.</i>

383
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,670
Why are you like this?

384
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,340
The old days came to mind.

385
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,280
After all this while, if we return to that...

386
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,380
Seonbae, what are you doing?

387
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,580
Think about our Cheongju trip.

388
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,410
That's it!

389
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,900
- What are you doing? 
- What are you doing, Dad?

390
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,960
I have to go out for awhile. 
You guys have your dinner first.

391
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:52,510
Min Hyeok, after an accident, 
has no recent memories.

392
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,480
Till he recovers, you will need to 
take good care of your brother.

393
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,550
Of course, we are on the way to the hospital.

394
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,590
Currently crossing the Seongsu bridge.

395
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,620
<i>Child, say goodbye to your mother.</i>

396
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,090
<i>Tell your mother to go in peace.</i>

397
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,290
<i>Mom,</i>

398
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
<i>Go in peace.</i>

399
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,120
Who is he?

400
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,960
It's Jun Hyeok.

401
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,990
The brother you have been yearning for.
Jun Hyeok.

402
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,460
You are Jun Hyeok?

403
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,600
Why are you here only now? 
I had missed you so much.

404
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,940
<i>Why do you look like that?</i>

405
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,780
<i>I don't know...</i>

406
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,180
<i>Towards what, and where to
let myself carry on, and how...</i>

407
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,950
<i>He is not Jun Hyeok.</i>

408
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,050
What?

409
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,430
Why?

410
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,720
Isn't he the same one, from the test results?

411
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,910
I feel there is some mistake.

412
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,480
Somebody must have done something.

413
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,020
No matter how I look, 
it's not Jun Hyeok. That guy.

414
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,180
Sing together.

415
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,150
Louder!

416
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,050
That bastard.

417
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,930
Hey, you punk!

418
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,280
Won't take your hands off?

419
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,960
You crazy psycho bastard!

420
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,100
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

421
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,630
You!

422
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,700
Who would you be?

423
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,800
What?

424
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,640
There are such mad guys around?

425
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,880
I am a lawyer.

426
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,820
Please let me have a discussion with the victim.

427
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,020
The victim has already lodged a report.

428
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,490
You just stay quiet, over there.

429
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,200
<i>You didn't even feed the boys.
Where are you?</i>

430
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,440
<i>Chan U asked me to have a drink.
I'll be back in a jiffy.</i>

431
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,380
Still not letting go? Don't you know
who my husband is?

432
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,580
If I just make a call, all of you are finished. 
Do you know?

433
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,150
- Ajumma. Just be quiet, please! 
- Let go. Let go.

434
00:29:59,150 --> 00:29:59,890
Hold on.

435
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,350
One moment!

436
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,530
Excuse... Excuse me.

437
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,000
What?

438
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,400
Aren't you... perhaps Gim Do Sang?

439
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,500
You are...?

440
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,380
By any chance...

441
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,050
You remember?
It's me. Su Ji.

442
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,080
In our university days, didn't we join 
the folklore department together?

443
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,300
Go Su Ji.

444
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,870
Do Sang oppa.
(oppa - older brother, boyfriend)

445
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,740
Let's do a toast.

446
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,570
- Salut!
- cheers.

447
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,980
<i>This time who will be no. 1?</i>

448
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,020
<i>I was watching Taekwando yesterday. 
It's really great.</i>

449
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,220
<i>Keep it up. Keep up the top position.</i>

450
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,690
<i>Boxing and wrestling aren't bad either.</i>

451
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,260
<i>Let's go together.</i>

452
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,090
<i>I will be back after a toilet trip.</i>

453
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,290
<i>Wait for me!</i>

454
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,630
<i>Initially it was... Gim Dong Yul of the exhibition
that I liked a lot.</i>

455
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,610
<i>From today, oppa, is it okay if I like you...
more than Gim Dong Yul?</i>

456
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,710
<i>Su Ji.</i>

457
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,580
<i>Actually, right from the first time I saw you,</i>

458
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:41,190
<i>I felt that it's not Gang Su Ji, but you Go Su Ji,
that I found more beautiful.</i>

459
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,840
<i>Your... your... your... chin.</i>

460
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,040
No, no, no... You both... Your chins!

461
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,450
What do we do?
Please don't!

463
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,220
New Zealand is the country next to Australia.

464
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,370
Why are you asking grandpa such a question?

465
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,000
That ignoramus, really. How dare she
disgrace people like that?

466
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,990
This is the new office building
since our merger this time.

467
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,690
Why come to the company? If there's time, 
shouldn't you be finding the USB quickly?

468
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,000
Why are you learning Spanish?

469
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,430
I want to get your mother pissed off.

470
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,960
(In Spanish) Your school is shit.

471
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,410
You are talking to me in Spanish now?

472
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,680
I have a friend whom I have troubled a lot.

473
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,450
I want to repay a little.

474
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,730
No matter what, it seems like 
we'll need to get more meat.

475
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,090
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

(In Spanish) Behave yourself, please.

477
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,020
You want to challenge me, is that it?

478
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:40,830
Credit card!

479
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,310
Don't you have lots of money?

480
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,230
I'll return it in a flash.
