2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,960
Let me give it a try.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,840
Who told you to come in?

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,930
If I can convince Da Hu Zi, you must agree to my one condition.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,490
I don't know what you are saying. Get out.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,710
Wait.

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,280
Let him say it.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,230
What do you plan to do?

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,450
What I plan to do is none of your business,

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,660
but I believe that I surely can convince Da Hu Zi.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,780
I don't know where you are getting this confidence of yours.

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,830
Come in!

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,870
Older Brother Bai Ze! Older Brother Bai Ze!

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,290
Who is this?

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,440
Da Hu Zi's son.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,990
Are you sure of this?

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,680
What do you think?

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,940
Okay.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,750
Let's just do as you say.

20
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,400
If you need anything, just tell me.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,370
If I convince Da Hu Zi, you must help me with one favor.

22
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,140
Sure.

23
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,120
If you are able to do it, I will surely help you.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,570
I know about your power on this island.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,260
I want you to help me find my friends that got separated from me.

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,750
Do you still miss those friends of yours?

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,690
To tell you honestly, a month has already passed.

28
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,970
They might have already–

29
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,740
Impossible!

30
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,960
My friends surely are still alive.

31
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,900
Okay. I promise you.

32
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,970
As long as they're still alive on this island,

33
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,440
even if I have to dig three meters deep, I'll find them for you.

34
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,500
Then it is a deal.

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,090
Let's go.

36
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,980
Let's go look for you daddy, okay?

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,980
Okay.

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,510
Xiao Cai!

39
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,660
Why have you been avoiding me lately?

40
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,820
I am not.

41
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,940
You are just overthinking.

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,510
I am not overthinking.

43
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,480
Right now, other than being able to see you during meal times,

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,850
for other times, you'll run away every time you see me.

45
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,110
Including now.

46
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,700
You're really just overthinking.

47
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,100
I am just...

48
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,910
Just what?

49
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,640
This...

50
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,990
Just joking.

51
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,200
Don't know if you do but, anyway, I do.

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,780
That is every time I see you, my heart beats so fast.

53
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,500
Actually, we being like this is a bit unreasonable, isn't it?

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,830
Before the marriage, the couple usually don't see each other quite often, right?

55
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,660
<i>This stupid guy thinks it's real.</i>

56
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,490
<i>I really am committing sins.</i>

57
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,200
<i>If I don't continue this act and get found out,</i>

58
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,250
<i>the news might reach Xiao Dao.</i>

59
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,570
<i>But if I continue this act, what if he falls deeper and deeper?</i>

60
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,090
Hey.

61
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,400
What are you thinking?

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,310
I was thinking that you must be tired from working today.

63
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,170
Tired?

64
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,790
I don't feel that way.

65
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,750
I'm quite energetic.

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,820
Yuan Shuai,

67
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,120
I feel that... we...

68
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,590
we... we actually... actually aren't...

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,440
We actually aren't like how Xiao Mei said we are.

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,290
Being in love with each other and respects each other.

71
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,470
And also I even know that you're still thinking of Gao Ying Jun.

72
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,700
He must be a very special person.

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,830
I really don't know how you were able to survive in these five years without any news about him.

74
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,090
Dad! Dad!

75
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,100
Why are you here?

76
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,600
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,870
I brought an Older Brother.

78
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,860
Older Brother? Who?

79
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,880
When I got locked up in a cage by human traffickers that day,

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,530
it was this Older Brother who saved me.

81
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,380
I really don't know how to thank you.

82
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,410
If not because of you, I might not be able to see my son again.

83
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,540
No need to thank me.

84
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,380
All of his is our fate.

85
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,050
You saved my son so you're our whole family's savior.

86
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,030
Being a savior is too much. But...

87
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,280
Just say it.

88
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,300
I indeed have one thing that I want to ask your help with.

89
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,870
Say it.

90
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
It's about your captain.

91
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,810
You are one with them?!

92
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,590
No.

93
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,960
Although I don't know which side you are on,

94
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,180
I feel that you can consider the words they said.

95
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,580
Do you want me to betray him?

96
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,610
In your heart, he's indeed a good captain.

97
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,550
You also are a good sailor.

98
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,090
But a real good captain won't let his sailors' lives be in danger.

99
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,510
Think about it.

100
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,450
If the navy from the capital really come here to attack us, will you be able to take care?

101
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,030
Do you plan to be like them and die in the sea?

102
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,120
You have such an adorable child.

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,680
What will happen to him then?

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,520
But... I've followed him for twenty years after all.

105
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
Loyalty is good.

106
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,020
But stubborn loyalty is stupidity.

107
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,770
You–

108
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,310
Forgive me for talking so bluntly. Sorry.

109
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,730
No need to say it anymore. Please leave.

110
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,450
Okay. Goodbye.

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,580
Dad, Dad, just help him.

112
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,340
I beg you.

113
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,830
Wait!

114
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,630
I am agreeing with it.

115
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,460
Be careful. It's hot.

116
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,030
I don't know what Xiao Mei told you.

117
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,030
Ying Jun and I are childhood friends.

118
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,760
Whenever I remember his name,

119
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll recall those wonderful times we were together.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,240
Just thinking about it, I can be happy the whole day.

121
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,400
But five years ago, he went out to sea just for his dream.

122
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
I was unable to stop him

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,660
and also didn't have the reason to.

124
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,820
Right?

125
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,350
Of course, you could have tried to stop him.

126
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,350
But... you have no power to control what the ending would be.

127
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,280
You must miss him a lot.

128
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,400
Although I don't have a smart brain,

129
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,340
I can see that you're very lonely.

130
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,140
Being alone isn't lonely.

131
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,680
It is when you think of someone else that makes you feel lonely.

132
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,240
Then do you plan to continue... continue thinking about him?

133
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,380
It's not up to me.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,070
Sorry.

135
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,720
It's fine.

136
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,430
You... you must feel that I'm stupid, right?

137
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,850
Being stupid is very easy.

138
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,010
He only needs to be persistent in the path he believes in

139
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,790
and he will already see the result and answer.

140
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,130
But being stupid is also hard.

141
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,220
Because the path he'll walk on is destined to be very difficult.

142
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,910
For every step he takes, he must suffer 10 times more pain than others.

143
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,890
And also, those people, who care about you,

144
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,860
will also be very sad.

145
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,110
Are you talking about me?

146
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,150
I am also talking about myself.

147
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,180
In summary, Yuan Shuai, I feel guilty towards you.

148
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,830
Actually, it's not only due to this,

149
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,700
there are also other...

150
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,570
other–

151
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,130
Why are you saying this?

152
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,730
I know that you must have some other intentions for choosing me to be your fiance,

153
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,930
but it's fine.

154
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,860
Since the day I woke up,

155
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,010
I felt that I had a new life, a very clean one.

156
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,990
Plus, I got to meet you.

157
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,340
When I first saw you, I felt that we seemed to have known each other for many years and are very close.

158
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,720
Anyway, it's... I feel very happy.

159
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,090
I'm not unhappy or hurt at all.

160
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,810
This... it's fine.

161
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,630
But... I still feel... that I'm being too cruel.

162
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,670
Yuan Shuai, you are very good. You are very, very good.

163
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,270
You shouldn't bear all of this.

164
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,340
Everyone must take responsibility for their choices.

165
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,610
These are things that I should bear.

166
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,830
You really are stupid.

167
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,490
I am very smart, okay?!

168
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,690
I know a lot of things.

169
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,270
Whatever you want, I can get it for you.

170
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,920
I don't want anything.

171
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,530
Hey? Xiao Cai, don't you believe me?

172
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,580
I believe you.

173
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,660
It's just that... I don't need them.

174
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,980
- It's cold now. You can drink it.<br>- Thank you.

175
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,900
<i>Should I tell him the truth or not?</i>

176
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,150
Once you drink this water, you're my woman.

177
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,980
You are so hateful! Annoying! Hateful!

178
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,030
Who told you to say those words while I'm drinking water?

179
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,710
Xiao Cai,

180
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,460
I want to apologize to you.

181
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,020
Apologize for what?

182
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,760
Because I didn't ask for your permission and just fell in love with you.

183
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,220
But don't misunderstand.

184
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,690
I am only admitting my mistakes.

185
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,820
But... I have no intention of changing.

186
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:13,320
Anyway, I'll... no matter what, I'll still keep liking you one-sided like this.

187
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,690
I'm done with what I want to say. Just like this.

188
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,370
I'll go back to work now.

189
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Your appearance is especially like my Shi Shi

190
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,930
when you don't talk.

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Just like you, she also has two big eyes,

192
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,200
curved eyebrows, and pointed chin.

193
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,300
But Shi Shi is different from you!

194
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,400
You are always so cold!

195
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,400
Who will smile at you? Stinky pirate!

196
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,700
Who do you think you are?!

197
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,300
What are you saying?

198
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,500
Are you saying bad words about my Shi Shi?!

199
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,600
Fine. Fine. Fine. Your Shi Shi is the prettiest and the best, okay?

200
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,250
I really don't understand you men.

201
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,000
Why must you use alcohol to solve your problems?

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's the use of getting totally drunk?

203
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,800
Your Shi Shi is already dead.

204
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
Can't you let it go?

205
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Be a good person and continue living well.

206
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,800
This is also something that she would have wanted to see.

207
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,390
What did you say?

208
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,500
Let go?

209
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,470
One term with two words. You say it like it's so easy,

210
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,900
as if you're just breathing.

211
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,600
But do you know that

212
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
every time I think about how Shi Shi was strangled,

213
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,950
my heart aches every time I breathe.

214
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,600
Do you know that?!

215
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Let go?

216
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
May I ask if in this world, how many people can really do it?!

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,400
You are saying bad words about my Shi Shi, right?

218
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,450
Okay!

219
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,800
I'll kill you bitch today then!

220
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,000
Shi Shi, just watch.

221
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,200
I will kill all these people that say bad words against you.

222
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I will kill all these people who have offended you!

223
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,330
What are you doing?!

224
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,600
Don't come near!

225
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,300
Let go of me!

226
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,200
What are you doing?!

227
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Get lost!

228
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Let go of me!

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,000
KoreanDramaX.co

230
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,400
Captain, oh no! Hou Zi has been killed!

231
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,700
<i>Who did this? So cruel.</i>

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
<i>So cruel. So tragic.</i>

233
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
This one died so tragically.

234
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,600
Throwing a knife through his brain, isn't that like opening one's heavenly eye?

235
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,090
<i>This matter isn't that simple.</i>

236
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>He died so tragically.</i>

237
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,100
<i>That's right. So tragic.</i>

238
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,200
<i>Captain is here!</i>

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,600
Hou Zi... has followed me for eight years.

240
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,000
A buddy who has followed me for eight years through life and death.

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We cannot just let him die like this.

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,100
Everyone here on our ship is my buddy.

243
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,000
I am the one who said these words.

244
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
I, Cheng Ming Pan, am a man of my word!

245
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,000
- How did Hou Zi really die?<br><i>- We must take revenge for him!</i>

246
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Everybody is saying that it was that Ming Zhen.

247
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,900
I heard that Captain and that Ming Zhen have a past.

248
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,500
Someone is spreading rumors that Ming Zhen killed Hou Zi.

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,750
Ming Zhen is my friend.

250
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,600
I'll surely confront her about this.

251
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,400
I'll surely give you all an explanation!

252
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,700
We need a new captain!

253
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,110
Who? Who said that?

254
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,030
Stand out!

255
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
I am the one who said it.

256
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,100
Our captain right now is caught in a dilemma.

257
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,200
I suggest that we vote again and choose a new captain!

258
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,500
You brat, shut up.

259
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,600
Think about it, everyone. Before, we exerted so much effort

260
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,000
to steal from the government ship so we could finally be able to get some money.

261
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,190
If we become hostile with Ming Zhen now,

262
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,210
will the Captain really stand on our side and think about our interests?

263
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,200
Then wouldn't he have died for nothing?

264
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,800
I believe that everyone has already heard the rumors.

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,700
Right now, the government is really focused on going after this matter.

266
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,200
She and our Captain have a good relationship.

267
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Just to find a scapegoat, Hou Zi then had to be sacrificed.

268
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,200
If this matter continues like this, we will all be sacrifices.

269
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,620
You brat better shut up first.

270
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,800
I have the right to talk!

271
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,320
If a half of all the sailors here are discontented with the captain,

272
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,980
we then have the right to choose a new captain.

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
This is also one of our pirate rules.

274
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,000
We want to choose a new captain! A new captain!

275
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,200
A new captain! We want to choose a new captain!

276
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,350
I agree with you all choosing a new captain.

277
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,580
We must not break the pirate code of rules.

278
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Who is this new captain that you all are recommending then?

279
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,900
I suggest... Da Fu!

280
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,000
Da Fu! Da Fu! Da Fu...

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Older Bro Hu Zi, who do we choose?

282
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
Let's first observe.

283
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Da Fu! Da Fu! Da Fu...

284
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,000
Da Fu, 17 votes!

285
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
<i>17 votes? Just 17? The situation is not good.</i>

286
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,050
Cheng Ming Pan, 16 votes.

287
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
<i>There aren't enough votes.</i>

288
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,090
Wrong.

289
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,000
There are 36 people on our boat.

290
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Minus the dead Hou Zi, that's a total of 35 people.

291
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,350
There are only 33 votes here.

292
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,200
Where are the two votes?

293
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,950
Who still hasn't voted?

294
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,400
Stand out. You cannot not vote.

295
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,300
- I abstain.<br>- I also am abstaining.

296
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,800
Abstaining? How do you count abstaining?

297
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,250
How do we count that?

298
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,680
Just count it an abstain.

299
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,000
Hey, Captain! Captain!

300
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,600
I am announcing that our new captain is Da Fu!

301
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Da Fu! Da Fu! Da Fu! Da Fu...

302
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,290
Hey, Yuan Shuai, it's so busy there in the hot springs.

303
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,470
Why aren't you helping out?

304
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,710
Although I lost my memories,

305
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,250
I feel that I have encountered the largest bottleneck of my life.

306
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,800
I know that the person who Xiao Cai is thinking in her heart is Gao Ying Jun.

307
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,400
I also have clearly told myself that I don't care about this.

308
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
But how come I still feel sad?

309
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
When it comes to love, it's really not up to oneself.

310
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
The more you try to console yourself, the more it means that you are affected by it.

311
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,330
Right now, I feel my limbs are so out of energy.

312
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,800
When I wake up everyday, I feel that I can't even stand stably.

313
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,600
When I wake up, I feel that I am not cleaned no matter how many times I take a bath.

314
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, right. There are also auditory hallucinations.

315
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,960
Is it like when you see people in the streets passing by,

316
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,000
- you feel that they are stronger than ten more times?<br>- Yes.

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,940
Do you suddenly realized that you have so many bad traits?

318
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Yes.

319
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,540
Is your mood so unstable?

320
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,400
One moment you're happy and the next moment, you feel down?

321
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,100
- You can't even take care of your own life anymore.<br>- Yes.

322
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,700
Oh, my god. How come you are so accurate?

323
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,600
Doctor, please tell me what illness I have!

324
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,000
You still need an old doctor like me to cure you.

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,200
Please check my pulse.

326
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,900
The source of your illness is with my older sis.

327
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,160
How come upon just mentioning my older sis, you become listless?

328
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,970
Because I feel so confused.

329
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,390
It's like I didn't consider her feelings first yet I disturbed her.

330
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,000
Then did she reject you?

331
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,200
That's the strange part.

332
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,800
I initially thought that when you love someone, being good to her is your own thing.

333
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,000
But thinking about it afterwards, it seems to be not like that.

334
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,380
If I really don't expect to receive anything in return,

335
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,200
how come I am so sad now?

336
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,100
Just thinking about it, I really am such a hypocrite.

337
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,400
Did my older sis really not give you any reply?

338
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,600
None. None at all.

339
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,800
What did she tell you?

340
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,060
Tell everything to me exactly like how she said.

341
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,200
You must tell me each word.

342
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,800
She asked me if I was tired.

343
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,000
Thinking about it now, she seems to be quite concerned about me.

344
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,440
Those are just courteous words.

345
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,300
What else did she say?

346
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,100
I couldn't ask. Neither could I stop him.

347
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,600
That is what she said.

348
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,100
She also said, 'right?'

349
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,870
<i>Ying Jun and I are childhood friends.</i>

350
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,830
<i>Whenever I remember his name,</i>

351
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,400
<i>I'll recall those wonderful times we were together.</i>

352
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
<i>Just thinking about them, I can be happy the whole day.</i>

353
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,200
<i>But five years ago, he went out to the seas just for his dream.</i>

354
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:08,000
<i>I was unable to stop him and also didn't have the reason to.</i>

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,200
She also told me a lot of stories about Gao Ying Jun.

356
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,800
That's right then.

357
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,200
What?

358
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
Are you stupid?

359
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,750
What is the position of Gao Ying Jun in my older sis' heart?

360
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,600
The fact that she was able to tell you the most wonderful memories in her heart

361
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
means she treats you as a confidante.

362
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Think about it. Who will talk about one's most hidden weakness and despair to some stranger?

363
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,400
No matter in what tone she said it.

364
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,000
What you said is quite reasonable.

365
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
When she talked about stopping him, how did she said it?

366
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,400
I couldn't ask. Neither could I stop him, right?

367
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,100
That's right then!

368
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,180
Talk properly. What right?

369
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,280
Not only does she treat you as a confidant,

370
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,600
but she also wants to get your reply.

371
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,130
I answered.

372
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,800
I told her...

373
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>Of course, you could have tried to stop him.</i>

374
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,400
<i>But... you have no power to control what the ending would be.</i>

375
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,400
What? Did I say anything wrong?

376
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,200
That's not the reply she wanted.

377
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,600
It'd have been better if you said nothing.

378
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,500
What else did she say?

379
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,100
She even said, "You really are so stupid."

380
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
You indeed are so stupid.

381
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,230
She already said that you are stupid.

382
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,000
Why are you still dwelling about replies?

383
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,600
That is her reply.

384
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,000
What did she reply about?

385
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,720
You can't look at a woman's reply superficially.

386
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,600
You must try to understand it oppositely.

387
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,110
If she tells you to leave,

388
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,200
it means 'come back, hug me tightly.'

389
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,820
If she says that 'this item is too expensive, I don't want it anymore,'

390
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,800
It means 'thank you, I want them all.'

391
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,300
If she asks you if your heart has her or not,

392
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,920
it means to not say anything; just kiss.

393
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,000
You think about it yourself.

394
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,900
How about this? Let us put it in a simpler way.

395
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,600
What does she mean by saying that I am stupid?

396
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,320
What it means is she doesn't know how to face you.

397
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,900
She also is very confused.

398
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Then it means... I still have a chance?

399
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,450
Of course.

400
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,400
And also, a very good chance.

401
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,610
In a few days, it is my older sis' birthday.

402
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,200
You are on your own. I'm going now.

403
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,630
Xiao Mei! Xiao Mei! No...

404
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,300
what I mean is Older Sis Xiao Mei.

405
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,800
Let me tell you. Don't let me prepare some birthday surprise for you.

406
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,580
Older Sis Xiao Mei, look if there is anyone else here who can help me.

407
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,800
If you don't help me, I will end up so tragically.

408
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,400
There are three major tragedies in life.

409
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,600
First, so poor that you don't have a way to do evil things.

410
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,400
Second, so hungry that you don't know what to eat.

411
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,200
Third, so sleepy that you are unable to sleep.

412
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,230
You haven't even experienced any of these major life tragedies.

413
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,200
What is there for you to be tragic about?

414
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
- I'm going now.<br>- Hey! Hey!

415
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,200
Don't go. If you leave, I will really be kneeling.

416
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,500
Kneel then.

417
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,450
I'm kneeling.

418
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,970
Xiao Mei, help me...

419
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,800
Help me...

420
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,400
Xiao Mei... Older Sis Xiao Mei!

421
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,600
Wrong... Older Bro Xiao Mei... Help me...

422
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,800
<i>What I am doing is step by step trying to get my older sis and Yuan Shuai together.</i>

423
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,630
<i>This wasn't my initial intention.</i>

424
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,400
<i>I just wanted the recipe for his family sauce.</i>

425
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,710
Okay. Okay. Okay.

426
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,000
I'll help you.

427
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,700
But what should we make?

428
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,020
Then what should our first step be?

429
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,090
A birthday surprise

430
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,200
is just some kind of tricks but we must add more sincerity.

431
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,150
My older sis is a person who has gone through ups and downs.

432
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,500
She might not feel moved with such things.

433
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,400
Come.

434
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:37,980
KoreanDramaX.co

435
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,600
I've waited for this day for so long.

436
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,210
Come in.

437
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,600
How about it? What is the feeling of being the captain?

438
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,930
This time, it's all thanks to you.

439
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,400
- Hey...<br>- Don't worry.

440
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,600
As long as you follow me, you surely will earn.

441
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,400
Don't say that. This captain position can be anyone.

442
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,800
But there are some captains that when they eats meat, I can only drink soup.

443
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,100
With you as the captain, when you eat meat, I also can eat meat.

444
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,700
What you said is so right!

445
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Looks like there are a lot of stories behind this.

446
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,880
Did you hear it all?

447
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,200
Men come quickly!

448
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
Enough! Stop hitting! Stop hitting! Stop hitting!

449
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,900
Break up! Break up!

450
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,140
Let go!

451
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,340
Just because you didn't get voted as captain,

452
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,500
your innate personality has surfaced!

453
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,400
Let me tell you. It's not me who stole your captain position.

454
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,970
It was decided by votes by the whole ship members.

455
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,480
- Drag him away!<br>- Yes!

456
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
Go! Go!

457
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,500
How are you ?

458
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,100
Crazy dog.

459
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,930
Xiao Cai, in here, I want to tell you, happy birthday.

460
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,550
These aren't some courteous words.

461
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
Because from the moment I first saw you,

462
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,600
I already know that you are hiding some things in your heart.

463
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,700
You must be very tired, painful, and sad.

464
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,800
Maybe I am just fated to meet you,

465
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
but don't have the luck to be with you.

466
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,000
But I really don't want you to keep living a life like this.

467
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,470
If you keep immersing yourself in your memories,

468
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,400
then how will you be able to take a step towards the future?

469
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,400
So promise me. Walk out of it, okay?

470
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,500
Oh, my–

471
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,970
- Older Sis, don't be like this.<br>- Let me in.

472
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,200
- Let me in!<br>- Older Sis... Older Sis...

473
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,900
<i>- Just get in later. Just get in later.<br>- Let me in.</i>

474
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,700
Older Sis, the meals haven't been prepared yet.

475
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,850
Once the meals are ready, I'll just call you to eat.

476
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,570
Older Sis, just go back to your room first to rest.

477
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,200
I know that you are making some birthday surprise for me, isn't that so?

478
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,490
I am not stupid.

479
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,900
You two have been acting weird since this morning.

480
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,600
I already warned you not to make these messed up things and make me unhappy.

481
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,800
You know that I hated these ceremonies the most, especially birthday presents.

482
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,470
Older Sis, we didn't prepare any birthday presents.

483
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,400
<i>Not birthday presents.</i>

484
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,500
<i>There are really no birthday presents.</i>

485
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,600
<i>Older Sis, just go back first.</i>

486
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,010
There really are no birthday presents.

487
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,000
It's just a normal meal.

488
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,430
- It's true, Older Sis. Go back first. Try getting more rest.<br>- Especially ribbons and candles,

489
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,400
so old-fashioned.

490
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,040
Older Sis, just go back to your room and rest.

491
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,400
I'll just call you later when it's time to eat, okay?

492
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,200
- Let me in. Let me in.<br>- Jeez, Older Sis.

493
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,910
Older Sis, didn't I already tell you?

494
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,400
The meals are not yet prepared.

495
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,960
- Just go back first.<br>- If you still don't open the door, I won't be polite anymore.

496
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,400
Older Sis!

497
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,800
Look. Look. Such good flower vases.

498
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,000
Look at one. Look how good they are.

499
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,600
Lord Ding?

500
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,100
It's really a coincidence.

501
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,300
Never thought I would meet you here.

502
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,570
I previously went to look for you.

503
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,200
I also have returned the hiring money.

504
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,100
I know. Ma Shun already told me.

505
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,380
You people from above ground are able to live here so leisurely.

506
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,200
That's quite a surprise.

507
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,980
If you have money, you can make anything happen.

508
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,800
It's the same above ground or underground.

509
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,710
You said that you are going into seclusion.

510
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,800
Why didn't you go find a beautiful place

511
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,000
and instead come to a forever sunless place like the underground city?

512
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,100
You surely have something to do here, right?

513
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,390
Nothing.

514
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,200
I just visited an old friend while passing by here.

515
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,100
A lone assassin who doesn't even blink when killing people will also have a friend?

516
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,600
Lord Ding, you really are making jokes.

517
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,800
But... how come Lord Ding is here in the underground city?

518
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,200
Only that item can make me personally attend to a matter.

519
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,000
I still remember that you owe me a favor.

520
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,800
I indeed said so.

521
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,530
But... if Lord Ding is asking me to find the Magic Star,

522
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,800
I am afraid I won't be able to do so.

523
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,540
This time, it doesn't concern the Magic Star.

524
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,400
I want you to help me with one thing.

525
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,030
Since we were fated to meet here,

526
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,920
let's look for a place and have some drinks.

527
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,730
Come with me.

528
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,800
If my guess is right, this Magic Star is in the hands of Lord Xiu Fu.

529
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,640
I just need you to help think of a way for me to get near him.

530
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,600
I can get the Magic Star on my own.

531
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,400
The past city leaders have all lived inside the city leader palace.

532
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,000
It not only has very tight security, but it's also a very mysterious place.

533
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
If you just recklessly enter it, you surely will not have any success.

534
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,400
Even for me, neither can I guarantee 100% success.

535
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,390
Lord, what I don't understand is

536
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,400
since this Lord Xiu Fu has been living all his life here in the underground city,

537
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,130
he totally has no plans of going out.

538
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,600
Then what is his purpose for getting the Magic Stars?

539
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,400
<i>Lord Xiu Fu feels that he has abundant power now</i>

540
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,400
<i>and wants to use the Magic Stars to summon the God's Army.</i>

541
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,500
God's army?

542
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,500
What?

543
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,990
Nothing.

544
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,610
Do you have a way or not to let me get near him?

545
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,030
Looks like there is only one way.

546
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,000
Tricking them.

547
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,000
Tricking them?

548
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,480
You even are able to come up with such an idea?

549
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,600
Such a despicable method, will it work?

550
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,250
Just relying on trickery, of course, it definitely won't work.

551
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,400
But with the Magic Stars, it might work.

552
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,800
If I haven't guessed it wrongly, Lord Ding,

553
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,840
you most likely have more than one Magic Star now in your hands.

554
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,000
I really never thought... I really never thought that someone would still help me at this time.

555
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,510
It's not the time to say these things.

556
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,700
Hurry and go!

557
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,400
What are you doing?!

558
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,080
I am already not the captain

559
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,410
and you cannot be the captain's wife.

560
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,000
Hurry and leave with me.

561
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,900
Hurry and go!

562
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,400
Oh, no! Captain, he has escaped!

563
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,000
- Who?<br>- Cheng Ming Pan has escaped.

564
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Are you still waiting for me to catch him personally?!

565
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,300
Aren't you going to lead some men to chase after him?!

566
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,400
Yes!

567
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,100
Go! Useless!

568
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,900
Reporting to city leader, an outsider is requesting an audience.

569
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,800
We here at the underground city never make dealings with outsiders.

570
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,040
I won't see them.

571
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,200
Send them out.

572
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,900
But... they say they have news about the Magic Stars.

573
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,470
They know about the Magic Stars?

574
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,200
Okay. Call them in.

575
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Yes.

576
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,700
Bring them here!

577
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,600
Greetings, City Leader.

578
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,530
No need for formalities.

579
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,950
Who are you two?

580
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,600
A person who wanders the world, no need to ask for our origin.

581
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,590
Since you were able to enter the underground city,

582
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,400
it shows that you aren't just some ordinary people.

583
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,300
Now, you actively want an audience with City Leader

584
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,800
but you answer in puzzling ways.

585
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,130
Aren't you giving importance to City Leader?

586
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,730
City Leader, please don't be mad.

587
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,300
We both have no evil intentions.

588
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,600
I heard that you know about the Magic Stars.

589
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,600
We are wandering shamans that passed by this area.

590
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,400
We suddenly sensed a mysterious energy.

591
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,000
Such energy is like a spirit from a worldly king.

592
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,800
So we can't help but to come in and take a look.

593
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,700
If we have caused any disturbance, please forgive us.

594
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,900
Spirit of a king?

595
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,480
Your words are quite interesting.

596
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,200
Then please continue saying it.

597
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,800
From time immemorial, only regions where heroes are born will have such spirit.

598
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I came after it up to here and saw that this spirit is different from other places.

599
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,400
What is the difference?

600
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,200
It isn't floating, dispersing, spreading or leaving.

601
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,400
Just go straight to the point!

602
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,400
Are you saying that I'm not qualified to be the city leader?

603
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,800
Not so.

604
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,050
The spirit of a king is with a person since he is born.

605
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,650
If its origin isn't from here,

606
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,200
then there can only be one explanation.

607
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,000
Continue.

608
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,600
That is because of the Magic Star.

609
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,400
Magic Star? Continue talking.

610
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
I can sense the power of the Magic Star.

611
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,000
Or else, I wouldn't have come into this underground city either.

612
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,600
Okay. Then let me ask you.

613
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,200
Do you know what the total amount of Magic Stars is?

614
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,200
There are clouds in ancient times, five stars of different colors,

615
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,100
including yellow, blue, crimson red, green, and black.

616
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,370
You really got them all right.

617
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,800
Fine. Then can you tell me

618
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,300
where the other Magic Stars are right now?

619
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,840
These...

620
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,530
I still am not able predict.

621
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,160
I need to carefully calculate it.

622
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:44,600
If you can help me find the other Magic Stars,

623
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
I surely will reward you handsomely.

624
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,600
Thank you, City Leader.

625
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,800
Informing City Leader. I have a mirror

626
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,400
which can show you the whereabouts of the object you show it.

627
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,300
I hope City Leader can hand over the Magic Star in your hands so I can shine my mirror on it.

628
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,750
City Leader, do you not believe me?

629
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,600
City Leader.

630
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,200
In our underground city, nothing bad can happen.

631
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,600
Yes.

632
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,400
Men! Bring out the Magic Star.

633
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,700
Let the shaman appreciate it.

634
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,200
Mr. Shaman, what did you see?

635
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,110
City Leader, this mirror is telling me

636
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,010
that the Magic Star is just in this underground city.

637
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,200
- Okay already.<br>- What are we going to do now?

638
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,510
Don't follow me anymore.

639
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,900
If you follow me, you'll just get into trouble. Go now.

640
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,100
Stop! Stop! Stop...

641
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,200
In there! Hurry! After him! Stop!

642
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,600
Stop! Don't run!

643
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,200
Stop! Hurry!

644
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,200
Stop!

645
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,300
Hurry! Hurry!

646
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Jumping from this high, he surely would have died.

647
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,000
Let's go. Let's go.

648
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,900
Xiu Xiu, so great. This is... What are you making?

649
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,080
Dad,

650
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,000
you tell me, is there really a sun in this world?

651
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,400
Of course, there is.

652
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,100
Then... will the sun talk with me?

653
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,000
Xiu Xiu, very soon, I'll take you above the ground.

654
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,400
You'll then see the sun and what it looks like.

655
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,800
You will then know if the sun can talk or not.

656
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,500
You always say it like that.

657
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,200
Come. I'll let you see some good stuff.

658
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,600
Here. Look. Is it beautiful?

659
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,700
Wonderful. So beautiful.

660
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,770
This is called a Magic Star.

661
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,400
There are five of them with five different colors in total.

662
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,600
I initially have one plus this one.

663
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,030
Then, we have two.

664
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,400
When we have gathered all five,

665
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,000
I can then take you to see the sun.

666
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,400
Really?

667
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,000
When have I lied to you?

668
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,200
Careful. Careful.

669
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,800
City Leader, were you looking for me?

670
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,960
Xiu Xiu, play on your own first.

671
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,000
I'll just talk with this uncle for a while.

672
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,500
Yes.

673
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,900
Come.

674
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,370
Xiu Xiu has been like this for these past years.

675
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,800
It was really hard on City Leader.

676
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,600
If not because Madam in the past...

677
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,000
Don't mention past things anymore.

678
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,800
With the help of miracle doctor Gongsun, Xiu Xiu

679
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,200
being able to survive is already not easy.

680
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:43,390
So the reason that you had always refused to do cruel moves

681
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,700
against Gongsun Miao Quan is this, right?

682
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Pi Wu,

683
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:58,200
someone told me that the remaining Magic Stars are here in the underground city.

684
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,800
No... City Leader,

685
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,400
you aren't suspecting me of taking these Magic Stars and not giving them to you, right?

686
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,820
You don't need to be that nervous.

687
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,600
We cannot totally believe the words of the Jianghu wizard.

688
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,000
But we also can't totally not believe it.

689
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,600
Xiu Xiu.
