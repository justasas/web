1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,730
I need to do whatever I can to convince her.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,130
She is staying at his home. She's the best
candidate to find and get us the USB.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:15,630
Of course I know it's dangerous, but now is
not the time to pick and choose.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,200
She's here. Hanging up.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,140
Over here. Here!

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,580
I didn't know what you would like,
so I got what came to my mind.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,810
Something expensive.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,720
I'm sure I'll enjoy it all.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,290
You will enjoy it all, you say?

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,540
Then hear what I say as you eat.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,860
Okay.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,630
Now, where should I begin?

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,500
It's nothing that big.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,600
At the moment, you're...

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,640
Excuse me.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,740
Yes, it's me.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,580
What?

18
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,150
Really?

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,550
Continue talking.

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,120
Why this rather inappropriate buttering up?

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,060
Why is he suddenly trying to get close?

22
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,260
But I am like, totally "thank you"!

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Short-rib stew!

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,900
It's really been a long time...

25
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,060
What's that? He left just like that?

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,040
<i>Who the hell was it?</i>

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,970
Who put a ball on the side at the entrance?

28
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,810
What's wrong? Did you hurt yourself?

29
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,110
He tripped on the ball and hurt his hip.

30
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,950
Who put the ball there?

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,050
Is it you?

32
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,520
It was just Cheol Min who was earlier--

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,190
How do you know it was Cheol Min?
A dog that can't talk!

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,660
It's true.

35
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,330
He was playing with that in his mouth, 
and he left the ball there.

36
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,160
You sure it wasn't you who 
played with that in your mouth?

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,630
You come over here, hurry!

38
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,200
Please stop it. You think it's okay
not to go to the hospital?

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,770
For now, it seems using a warm mat and
watching for a while may make it better.

40
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,240
Still not coming? Hurry up!

41
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,800
If you want to kick, kick Cheol Min.
Why do you want to do it on me?

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,270
Come here fast!

43
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,370
I don't want to.

44
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,040
If you come, I will kick you once now.

45
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,170
Later if you catch me on anything, 
you kick me 10 times. Hurry, come!

46
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,180
Give it a rest, please! 
What changes if you kick his ass?

47
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,920
Thanks for your help.

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,850
Don't mention it. But really,
it was nearly big trouble.

49
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,790
I saw him standing there and about to fall,
and had to come running to hold.

50
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,830
That's right. But for our friend from the garage,
I would have nearly died.

51
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,660
Oh, thank you.

52
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,500
But how come you are 
so fast physically?

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,430
I was always really fast.
My old nickname was cheetah.

54
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,640
Ah, cheetah?

55
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,310
From now on, this 'cheetah'... I mean,

56
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,610
let us have these garage folks
use our bathroom.

57
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,910
- Right...
- To do that, they have to go even to street shops.

58
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,380
How can that be?

59
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,960
It's all right, sir.

60
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,150
We were done talking about this. 
Outsiders can't come into the house.

61
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,460
Please be understanding.

62
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,100
Yes.

63
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,000
So what if outsiders enter here?

64
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,210
Whatever it is, no way.

65
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,110
Just listen to what I say!

66
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,890
What's it again, with you?

67
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,360
It's alright, sir.

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,770
Though it is really inconvenient for us now,
it's fine if we go through it for a while.

69
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,600
Thank you.

70
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,900
I call this fellow to come, and 
he won't come, like he'll die.

71
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,470
You can die, but you
still won't listen to me.

72
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,880
Heck, if you both don't care to help me, then 
I should just die here with a head concussion.

73
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,280
Director sir.

74
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,850
Why? What's the matter? 
What's it?

75
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,520
The invoice from the restaurant earlier.

76
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,090
What is that?

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,500
I know I was the one who ate. But it was 
only as you asked me to a meal.

78
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,900
I had no money or card, so
I had to leave my ID card there.

79
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,100
So I should pay for this now?

80
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,200
How much is it?

81
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,300
160 thousand Won.
(~US$ 140)

82
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,870
What were you enjoying eating
for 160 thousand Wons?

83
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,180
It was just what you had ordered.

84
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,880
Here. Is that it?

85
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,920
For 160 thousand Wons, adding 10% tax,
it is 176 thousand Wons.

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,230
More and more demands...

87
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,360
I only have 150 thousand.
You pay 15 000.

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,570
Thank you.

89
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,700
Bugs me. Bugs me.
Why does she bug me so much?

90
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,170
She really doesn't give me a good vibe.

91
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,380
At first, the bad vibe was because
she's only a school grad.

92
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,840
But now nothing she does
leaves a good vibe.

93
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,940
Just eliminate her.

94
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,780
Why won't you stop that talk again?

95
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,980
You know nothing but killing
to eliminate everything?

96
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,450
I'm so with constant hindrances.

97
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,280
All hindrances must die?
Are you like a human eraser?

98
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,850
She's really seen me being
around you many times.

99
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,690
If she tells the CEO,
what do we do?

100
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,260
I too have hindered you,
so eliminate me too!

101
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,830
That talk was over, damn it.

102
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,500
We finished that talk, and are discussing
us being seen together, now!

103
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,800
Sorry. But the talk of us being a team
is really no big deal.

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,660
All the other employees only think that we are
together because we're in an alumni club.

105
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,670
Is that so?

106
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,440
Is that right?

107
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,150
But still, we have to be careful.

108
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,450
Good. Let us be careful and 
stop with that for today.

109
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,520
Here.

110
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,800
1, 2, 3... There!

111
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,130
How much meat did you eat?
Not even eating dinner?

112
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,530
Going to such a once-in-a-million-year
restaurant, I ate all of 2 people's food.

113
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,660
May be I got over-nourished?
Pigged out too much?

114
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,040
You want to go to the toilet?
Should I come along?

115
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,140
For now I'll try to stand it.

116
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,340
What's the point in standing it?
Hurry, go have a dump.

117
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,280
I'm not at that point yet.

118
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,680
I'm there, I'm there... at that point!

119
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,270
Go together?

120
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,250
You just eat.

121
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,190
The street light is fixed,
so it's bright enough.

122
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,860
Hey! Where are you going? 
I told you to take this to the hospital!

123
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,960
An important appointment came up.

124
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,790
What appointment,
if it's that important?

125
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,260
It's THAT important an appointment.

126
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,830
Chauffeur Gim isn't around. I need to go out too,
then what about this?

127
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,670
How sad!... What do we do,
big trouble...

128
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,870
You damn brat, seriously!

129
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,880
Hello.

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,350
Back from working out?

131
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,280
Not a work out. I went to a rest room.

132
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,850
You know...

133
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,050
I'm sorry, but could I ask you
to run an errand for me?

134
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,890
Run an errand? What is it?

135
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,090
I was to make a trip to my son's hospital.

136
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,760
But nobody is at home, and
I have an urgent appointment too.

137
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,860
May be if you could--

138
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,700
Yes, I understand.

139
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,170
Is it an okay time for it?

140
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,630
The time is extremely okay!

141
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,740
Is it so?

142
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,310
Then, I will pay you later. 
Take this over there.

143
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,870
- Yes, I understand.
- Thank you.

144
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,180
Also, in future if it's very urgent,
just use our house bathroom.

145
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,280
Huh?

146
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,110
- No. It's all right. 
- Thank you very much.

147
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,950
When it's urgent, we will sure use it.

148
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,150
In fact, when it's straining 
to come out, it's like dying.

149
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,250
So sometimes we may come to dump.

150
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:13,990
Mom!

151
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,190
Then let me go.

152
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,330
Mom, don't you have any self-respect?

153
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,260
You so easily talk of needing toilet to take dumps
when the bottom strains and you can't wait?

154
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,830
That's right. If we can take dumps,
I will easily talk.

155
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,770
Thanks to that, we don't have to
wait to dump. Isn't it good?

156
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,440
<i>That's all mine. All mine.</i>

157
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,640
In the end, she even found another man?

158
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,580
Guess we'll hear more of how bad the brat is.

159
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,290
If the bitch is so bad, kick her out anyway.

160
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,850
That's right. Just go back to the States.

161
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,520
In my view, it is all over.

162
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,830
But still I can't let her go.

163
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,230
Ah, a grown man cries over even this!

164
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,430
That's right, don't cry, man.

165
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,270
Wait!

166
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,840
It came out, it came out.

167
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,410
Go. Go. Go.

168
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,240
I am godori.
<i> </i>
("5 birds" - a 3-card set)

169
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,940
I was just shaken just now. 
Twice you, Ajumma. Double.

170
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,010
The godori set is still alive.
Why are you yelling Go?

171
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,350
Oh, it is right.

172
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,960
In the performance just now,
the last song was great.

173
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,500
"That side of the bridge... let's go"

174
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,800
Is it a song you made on the asteroid day?

175
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,100
What is it?

176
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,540
You aren't hurt, are you?
Are you all right?

177
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,160
Yeah.

178
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,810
How come even your reaction 
to pain is a half-beat slower?

179
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,890
Better be careful in future. Okay?

180
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,820
He's nowhere to be seen. 
Who are you yelling at?

181
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,210
What should we eat for dinner?

182
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,860
Shall we eat some meat?

183
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,430
You want to go eat meat?
I know a good place.

184
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,730
Strictly speaking, it was not
made on the asteroid day.

185
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,290
What's is that about...

186
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,180
Earlier... To what I asked on when it was made,
you are giving the answer now?

187
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,640
I wanted to tell you accurately.

188
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
What is this... really!

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,050
Oh hurry... Let's go eat some meat.

190
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,350
- How about some Potato soup? 
- Forget it.

191
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,370
Let's just eat meat.

192
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,940
Hello.

193
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,320
Ms. Na Jin A.

194
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,100
You're alone?

195
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,030
My sister just left to find the nurse.

196
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,890
Tada! Ice cream.

197
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,540
Woah! Thank you.

198
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,010
You're playing this? Rubik's cube.

199
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,300
I'm really good at it.

200
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,910
Really? I also used to play it as a kid.

201
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,980
Then try it!

202
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,650
How do you do this, again?

203
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,480
I forgot it all.

204
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,790
You can't? It's super easy.

205
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,900
Should I teach you?

206
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,990
Look closely.

207
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,810
Once the top is done like this,

208
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,780
Just like this, to the top, and then to the side.

209
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,570
Like this, to the bottom side.

210
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,860
How is it?

211
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,510
You got it, no?

212
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,310
Go ahead and try.

213
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,210
How did he do this?

214
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,630
It's super hard.

215
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,810
This is hard, you say?
I just showed you how it's done.

216
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,120
Na Jin A is not so smart or what...

217
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,300
How can this be difficult?

218
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,060
To the top and then to the side.

219
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,730
And then do the bottom...
and it's done!

220
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,030
I see.

221
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,340
You will recover really soon, seeing your 
old days' appearance coming out.

222
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,750
Old-days appearance?

223
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,940
No, not like that. I was just saying that 
you were always... extremely smart.

224
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,980
Even if I lost my memory, 
the brain is the same, right?

225
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,460
Sure.

226
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,750
So the family folks take turns everyday
to stay with you?

227
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,420
Yes. Except for Jun Hyeok. 
Jun Hyeok hasn't been here.

228
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,990
Who is Jun Hyeok?

229
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,860
It's the younger brother who went
missing as a young boy. Jun Hyeok.

230
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,900
Min Hyeok's memory stops before he 
went missing. He still doesn't know it.

231
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,840
As we fear that he'd get upset, 
we've kept it a secret for now.

232
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,670
So, Jin A, you also act like you don't know.

233
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,280
Sure.

234
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,580
<i>This is the 57th minute asteroid update.</i>

235
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,890
<i>There is news of a variation
in the asteroid's orbit.</i>

236
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,090
<i>According to the U.S. space agency, NASA,</i>

237
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,660
<i>though asteroid 2013QR3's orbit</i>

238
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,700
<i>is now approximately 60 km closer,
causing some nervousness,</i>

239
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:55,690
<i>it is observed that it is getting no closer,
and is in a stable and safe orbit.</i>

240
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,770
<i>You see those blue and red icons there?</i>

241
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,610
<i>The blue one is me, and the red one is you.</i>

242
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,810
<i>If the connected person
is within a 1 kilometer radius,</i>

243
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,640
<i>at that time "Near U" will flicker.</i>

244
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,480
<i>If you press it, it will show the location.</i>

245
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,680
Hold on a moment!

246
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,150
I need to get down here.

247
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,980
Ajussi!
(ajussi - older man, uncle)

248
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,550
I'm getting down here.

249
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,090
Terrible guy. He can't even call once?

250
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,390
A fleeting mayfly, more like a dung fly.

251
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,670
Son of a bitch.

252
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,810
What did you say?

253
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,270
I understand.

254
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,110
No. No. I will come over there.

255
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,310
Yes. Yes.

256
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,780
Honey. Get up fast. Hurry.

257
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,980
Why? What was the call about?

258
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,920
The detective agency center
wants us for something there.

259
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,020
What's up there?

260
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,850
It looks like they've found Jun Hyeok.

261
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,590
What?

262
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,420
You get dressed fast.

263
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,630
What has happened?

264
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,930
Wasn't there a report of a woman called
Sang Sun keeping the child?

265
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,230
It seems they found somebody
matching that report.

266
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,070
Ah, what's wrong with these pants?

267
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,000
Calm down. You have the pants on backwards.

268
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,780
Hurry, you too change clothes quickly!

269
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,420
Like those kidnappers had said, Jun Hyeok
does seem to have run away then.

270
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,820
If the reports are true on a Jeolla-dialect-speaking
woman called Sang Sun taking the child away,

271
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,760
then he accurately matches those specifications.

272
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,960
But how come you found that woman only now?

273
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,730
At that time, we had checked through the official
residents' register in that neighborhood,

274
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,570
but there was nobody matching the report.

275
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,970
As we found out, she wasn't living in that area,
but she was in Seongsu.

276
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,180
Moreover, she already died at age 96.

277
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,850
Once Jun Hyeok was sent to an orphanage,
we couldn't find him anymore.

278
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,410
Name and the name showing in the
official registry are unchanged.

279
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,250
But how did you find him now?

280
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,820
We happened to speak by chance
to somebody who knew him.

281
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,650
Though we will know only through a DNA test,

282
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,320
the specifications from that time
are matching accurately.

283
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,730
Then, where is he now?

284
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,930
He's next-door.

285
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,310
- Bring him in.
- <i>Yes.</i>

286
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,740
You are Jun Hyeok, am I right?

287
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,510
I don't really know.

288
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:59,650
You... don't recognize me?

289
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,580
How about Mom?

290
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,520
I am sorry.

291
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,350
Take a good look.

292
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,120
The two of us... don't bring out any memories?

293
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,690
Not really...

294
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,630
You don't remember even Mom?

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,200
Have a good look.

296
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,970
Mom's birthmark here...
You don't remember it?

297
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,640
You used to rub it every day.

298
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,790
This is our old family portrait. 
There is nobody that you remember?

299
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,860
I don't know for sure.

300
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,800
I think it is Jun Hyeok.

301
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,000
Isn't it so?

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,310
I do think he is Jun Hyeok.

303
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:07,910
Alone all these years...
How scary and difficult it must've been!

304
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,480
I am sorry for not finding you.

305
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,050
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

306
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,090
First of all, we have to do a DNA-test.
We will collect some hair.

307
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,770
Why do you look like that?

308
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,340
The stomach is still not well?

309
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,280
Yeah. How come it goes this long?

310
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,850
I think it's bathroom time.

311
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,120
Hello.

312
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,960
It's our seal nuna.
<i> </i>
(Nuna - Elder girl or sister for a male)

313
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,430
I'm not a seal.
<i> </i>
(Nuna - Elder girl or sister for a male)

314
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,890
Try to catch this and eat.

315
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,460
Don't do that.

316
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,420
Hey, what are you doing?

317
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,130
Hey boy, even after we told you 
not to throw food at people--

318
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,240
We're sorry.

319
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,640
Go. Hurry.

320
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,110
Let's go.

321
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,310
- Nuna, don't catch this. 
- Don't do that!

322
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,710
Has he come?

323
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,450
Not yet.

324
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,180
It's Jun Hyeok, right?

325
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,020
As per what Dad says, that seems right.

326
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,950
They left a while back.
Why haven't they come back?

327
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,520
Try to give them a call again.

328
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,610
Why aren't they back yet?

329
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,440
Come on, give me a ride on your back.

330
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,910
Yes. Yes.

331
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,750
Just stay there. They will come soon.

332
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,680
It's too stuffy, so I should go out
to the courtyard and wait.

333
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,520
It was enough to wait here.

334
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,820
- They have come.
- Oh, have they come?

335
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,020
Hurry. Over there. Go over there.

336
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,230
Quick. There, there, there, over there!

337
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,800
Quick, quick, quick!

338
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,830
You are... You are Jun Hyeok?

339
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,570
I am not.

340
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,400
Father. He is a staff person.

341
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,600
Jun Hyeok. Come on in.

342
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,070
Where?

343
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,640
Hello.

344
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,210
Are you Jun Hyeok?

345
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,250
You kid, where were you, to come only now?
Yes it's my dakpul.
(Dakpul - Sunset hibiscus flower. Also glue from it)

346
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,820
You're Jun Hyeok, right?
<i> </i>
(Dakpul - Sunset hibiscus flower. Also glue from it)

347
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,590
It's him, it's him, I guarantee.

348
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,420
This kid is our Jun Hyeok, I know.

349
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,530
Isn't it? Isn't it right?

350
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,990
It's right.

351
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,930
You don't remember this grandpa?

352
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,400
Not... really.

353
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,700
No memory at all about old times, right?

354
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,170
Yes.

355
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,370
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,210
Just for the bathroom...

357
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,140
Like said earlier, it's after your mom died
that you got to the orphanage, right?

358
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,080
Before she died, your mother
never told you anything?

359
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,550
She said nothing particular.

360
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,780
In the TV dramas, if it isn't the real mom,
it's normally said as last words.

361
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,320
Isn't this a drama?

362
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,150
The way I see, there's no doubt.

363
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,990
See the bridge of the nose on this fellow.

364
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,190
Precisely how he was when he was young.

365
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,760
Wasn't the bridge of your nose
just like mine then?

366
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,600
There's no mistaking it.

367
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,900
Don't be talking like you are so sure. 
You have done the same in the past too.

368
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,370
That time I was mistaken.

369
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,570
On him, I am right, you know!

370
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,510
His face is like a lion's.

371
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,070
He has a Maori tribe look.

372
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,280
Lion. Lion.

373
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,940
- What's with you both?
- To your uncle?

374
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,820
Hey! Red Sun.

375
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,190
Then, well.. As he doesn't remember anything,
we can only wait till the test results come out.

376
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,390
Yes. It will be out the day after tomorrow.

377
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,590
Then, where will he stay till then?

378
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,060
Well, that...

379
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,260
As they demolished the place he was staying at,

380
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,460
he doesn't seem to have a place to stay for now.

381
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,770
If it's okay, if he can stay here
till the test results come out...

382
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,970
Of course, he can do that. 
Where can he go otherwise?

383
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,800
Staying here is a bit strange.

384
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,640
What is strange?

385
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,210
Please take care of him till the results come out.
We will give money for that.

386
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,680
Look at you!

387
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,750
Money is all, in everything?

388
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,920
A kid who lived away for those 20 years.
You will send him out again?

389
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,380
Are you even in your senses now?

390
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,220
For God's sake, don't act so sure.

391
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,190
Matters in life are so fickle.
Must you get so excited so early?

392
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,780
We are sorry, but staying here is a bit weird.

393
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,660
What is so weird in that?

394
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,310
To me, you're the weirdest.

395
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,590
Grandfather. There is something to
what Mom says.

396
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,630
It's not too late if we wait till 
it is confirmed, you know.

397
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,000
Forget it, forget it.

398
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,670
He has nowhere to sleep.
What's wrong if he sleeps 2 nights here?

399
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,510
What are you doing?
Say something!

400
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,980
You are going to say nothing at all?

401
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,180
I was thinking of saying it.

402
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,110
Sure. Let him be here.

403
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,820
With no place close by, you also really--

404
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,660
Hey, it's commotion in the house!

405
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,630
Why?

406
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,960
Looks like the lost son has reappeared.

407
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,010
I too heard of him.

408
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,530
That he is the CEO's younger brother.

409
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,000
But they really found him?

410
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,980
It's looking that way.

411
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,240
I don't know who it is, but his fate
is about take a big turn for the best.

412
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,740
A lotto win, isn't? Lotto!

413
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,060
What does he look like? 
Similar to the CEO?

414
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,480
I couldn't see well, except for 
the back of the head.

415
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,980
Thanks for the dinner.

416
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,820
Why aren't you eating some more?

417
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,650
I ate a lot.

418
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,960
It doesn't seem like it at all, right?

419
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,370
Why? Because he can't remember?

420
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,200
It's usual for nothing to be recalled
from 4 years of age.

421
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,400
What? What? What are you talking about?

422
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,880
It's nothing.

423
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,440
That way, that way.

424
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

425
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,810
Over here?

426
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,350
Have some apple.

427
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,130
Eat some fruits.

428
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,850
Whether you're the real Jun Hyeok or not,
I am anyway older, so I'll be casual.

429
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,690
Eat some peach. Tasty.

430
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,520
No, thanks. I'll be eating some apple.

431
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,220
So you'll rebel?

432
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,620
Just teasing.

433
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,800
Grandfather...

434
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,370
This rascal...

435
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,940
You still know that the grandpa gets it first.

436
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,440
When Jun Hyeok was small, I accidentally poked
him with a fingernail. Won't the scar be there?

437
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,110
Yes. But will that be still there?

438
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,310
It wasn't bad enough to still be there.

439
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,350
Check it, check it. By chance
it could still be there, right?

440
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,960
As my eyes are bad...

441
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,390
I suppose it could be so.

442
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,430
I'm sorry, but let me take a look.

443
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,730
You can eat. You can eat. It's fine.

444
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,830
Is the mark there?

445
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,580
Not sure.

446
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,870
What?

447
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,800
- It's there?
- It's not this...

448
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,010
There's something that's
more conclusive than the scar.

449
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,840
What is it?

450
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,320
Jun Hyeok's circumcision
went a bit strange, right?

451
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,920
Circumcision?

452
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,510
When Min Hyeok was in primary school,
they were circumcised together.

453
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,440
As the suture on one side broke a bit early,
things looked a bit strange.

454
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,400
Weren't everybody laughing at that?

455
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,030
Oh, that's true, you're right.

456
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,130
Try checking that.

457
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,800
But that... How can we check it?

458
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,570
Why can't you?
Check it, check it.

459
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,040
Sorry that I'm asking...

460
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,610
Have you... had a circumcision?

461
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,150
Pardon?

462
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,280
Yes.

463
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,390
When was that?

464
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,470
Not really... sure.

465
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,090
Seeing you not remembering,
you must've been really young then.

466
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:31,060
Seems right. That's right.

467
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:37,180
Is it fine... for just one time,
if I try to check on something?

468
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,400
Thanks for doing that.

469
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,320
Eat some fruits.

470
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,540
So, how did it turn out?

471
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,740
You, help me.

472
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,580
Oh, yes.

473
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,780
On the back.

474
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,250
Make it quick.

475
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,720
Over there. Over there.

476
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,020
Giddy up. Quick, quick.

477
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,160
Okay, so what happened?
We were right?

478
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,930
Not sure. Usually it is supposed
to be like this, you know...

479
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:16,440
But... When he was small, the thing was a 
bit strange as it had become like this.

480
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,210
But his thing has actually become this way.

481
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,780
My thinking is that it looks different.

482
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,450
But then, how it looks can change
as one grows up, I suppose?

483
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,280
Sure. That can happen too.

484
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,590
That means, it is him, isn't he?

485
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,520
Guess so.

486
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,230
What's that sound?

487
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,170
Didn't you just hear the sound
of some wall cracking open?

488
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,000
It is the sound from my stomach.

489
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,840
What's wrong?

490
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,770
I've got a stomach flu.

491
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,080
It's coming.

492
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,540
What's it?

493
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,480
Just go to their house. 
How can you go to the store like this?

494
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,950
It's okay.

495
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,050
Just go to the house.

496
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,520
I don't want to.

497
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,190
<i>Na Jin A, you can do this.</i>

498
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,120
I can... not stand it.

499
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,690
You can't, right? 
See that!

500
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,460
Just go. Why not at the house?

501
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,440
Just let him use Jun Hyeok's
old 2nd floor room.

502
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,010
I'm sorry, but sleep here itself.

503
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,840
Yes. Thank you.

504
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,940
Geez.

505
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,880
- Then, if you want to eat anything at night...
- Just the toilet...

506
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,720
toilet is where you can eat.

507
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,820
What's that?

508
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,280
I'm sorry. Just needed the toilet...

509
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,390
Go on.

510
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,950
Thank you.

511
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,300
What's wrong?

512
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,860
- What sound is that?
- What's it, what's it?

513
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,070
I'm sorry.

514
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,040
What? How did this happen?

515
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,980
How come that guy...

516
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,320
Some toilet paper would've been nice.

517
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,990
I didn't bring the mobile phone either.

518
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,130
I will go insane.

519
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,400
Excuse me.

520
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,230
Excuse me!

521
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,930
Oh, I am sorry.

522
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,230
Good you came. 
What's with you?

523
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,070
How come you are here?

524
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,110
Don't tell me... you're this family's lost son?

525
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,210
Who are you?

526
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,310
You know me?

527
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,780
What?

528
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,710
Hongberg... Isn't it you?

529
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,810
Am I not right?

530
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,920
No.

531
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,380
Seeing you say no, I know it's you!

532
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,320
What's this? You are going to act dumb?

533
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,890
Why were you throwing so much stuff
onto the door like that?

534
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:23,990
Some toilet paper...

535
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,440
Toilet paper?

536
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,030
You used 5 pieces to finish it?

537
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,330
There was none! What 5 pieces?
Get it fast.

538
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,460
You told me that on so many days.
I too wanted to try it once.

539
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,370
Wait a moment.

540
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,060
You sonofa...

541
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,580
What are you doing?

542
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,720
Some toilet paper... She said there's no
toilet paper in the washroom.

543
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,190
I will give it to her.

544
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,860
Yes.

545
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,060
I'm sorry.

546
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,730
Hey, can't you get it fast--

547
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,570
I'm sorry.

548
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,670
I'm throwing this.

549
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,870
Thank you.

550
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,440
Embarrassing.

551
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,110
Really, the lost son in their house
is our next-door youngster?

552
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,680
I told you it's true!
I was also flat-out shocked.

553
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,510
How is this possible?

554
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,980
What to do about this now?

555
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,820
What do you mean what to do?

556
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,650
Hello.

557
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,120
I saw you going into this place.

558
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,590
Ajumma, have you been doing well?

559
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,890
Yeah... But how did this happen to you?

560
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,360
Are you really a son in this family?

561
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,830
No, I'm not.

562
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,030
How? I hear you are.

563
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,860
What a world!

564
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,370
Somehow, right from start, I was totally
getting the feeling that you were
totally of a dignified pedigree.

565
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,570
At first you reported me as a
murder suspect, you know.

566
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,770
It was this girl who reported you!

567
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,980
What is with this girl?

568
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,650
I can care less if you're the son here or not. 
Can't you call saying you're leaving, you bastard?

569
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,750
Why now, about that...

570
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,150
Without toilet paper, I wasn't thinking earlier,
so I forgot to kick your ass there.
But I just remembered.

571
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,250
Step out with me.

572
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,820
You damn well tell me clearly
what crap you've been up to.

573
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,390
Only you should hear that?
I want to hear too.

574
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,430
So I was with the people at
the private detective center.

575
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,100
You didn't even have time for a call?
Terrible fellow.

576
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,300
My mobile phone had to be changed.

577
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,870
I was all confused.

578
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,070
At first I thought I'd call to tell you everything.

579
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,910
All just talk, right?

580
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,740
Put in your number.

581
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,850
Like it's dark right below a lamp,

582
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,520
I was dumbstruck, and didn't even know
your phone number!

583
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,490
- Here.
- Name too!

584
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,060
I was dumbstruck that I really
didn't know your name either.

585
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,530
What is your name?

586
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,100
Hong.

587
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,560
Ber-geu.

588
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,400
Hongber... 
Damn you, seriously!

589
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,870
I'm asking what your real name is?

590
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,340
Hong Bo Gu.

591
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,900
Hong means jewel. Bo means see.
Gu is 9. So it means "see 9 jewels".

592
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,570
You're lucky that I hate just 
beating people up too fast!

593
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,780
Forget it. Fine.

594
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,350
If you are a son of that family,
you'll get a new name.

595
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,550
But, do you know that it's our CEO's family?

596
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,750
I knew just before coming.

597
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,590
Anyway, congratulations.

598
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,050
You're fortunate.

599
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,990
Being a son in such a rich family
simply does not fit you though.

600
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,460
I won't be.

601
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,930
- Won't be what?
- The son.

602
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:14,660
Why?

603
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,760
Again that "Not not" disease?

604
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,960
No.

605
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,000
But I wouldn't be.

606
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,940
Really.

607
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,750
Oh... The Near-U software you installed here
can be deleted, I think.

608
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,520
The registered users are only you and me.
We have no further use for it, right?

609
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,250
Just leave it there.

610
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,560
Why? For me to search for where I am?

611
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,120
Just...

612
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,430
leave it there.

613
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,360
Why are you coming out from there?

614
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,460
Just the bathroom...

615
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,660
The bathroom is here, no?

616
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,130
Was sleeping on the sofa uncomfortable?

617
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,330
No, it wasn't. Not at all.

618
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,270
Survive the discomfort just a bit more. 
The test results will be out real soon.

619
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,740
Sure, yes.

620
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,940
But, is it okay if I go out briefly?

621
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,670
Where to?

622
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,140
To a friend... just for a while.

623
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,880
Sure, fine.

624
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,650
-=Next Episode Preview=-

625
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,460
I've decided to give you up.

626
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,030
Romance can change too, I guess.

627
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,800
You go back right away and make sure to find it!

628
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,460
Report to me right away when it's found.

629
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,670
How come he is sleeping like this?

630
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,010
The men walking by just now
weren't even blinking while ogling.

631
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,460
Am I so inconspicuous in your eyes?

632
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,170
A have a not-recognizing disease.

633
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,860
The next-door youngster.
You grab him and come.

634
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,650
Don't talk nonsense, okay?
I hate him to death!

635
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,380
I'm so inconspicuous in your eyes
but you'll date me?

636
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,800
It affected my heart.

637
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,320
Isn't this a good thing?

638
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,880
That's why I said we'll date.

639
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,610
I just knew that you'd be like this.

640
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,450
Hongberg!

641
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,460
It seems the power is gone
in the whole neighborhood.

642
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,590
I will stay here till the power comes back.
