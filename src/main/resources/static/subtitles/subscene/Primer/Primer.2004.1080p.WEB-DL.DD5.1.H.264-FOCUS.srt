1
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,891
Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to read this...

2
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:41,297
and you're going to listen,
and you're going to stay on the line.

3
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:45,001
You're not going to interrupt.
You're not going to speak for any reason.

4
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,876
Now, some of this you know.
I'm going to start at the top of the page.

5
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:55,816
Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated.

6
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:57,889
They were these things.

7
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,514
Nothing extreme. Like anyone, they varied.

8
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:04,789
There were days of mistakes
and laziness and infighting.

9
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:09,165
And there were days, good days,
when by anyone's judgment...

10
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:11,867
they would have to be considered clever.

11
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:15,268
No one would say
that what they were doing was complicated.

12
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:19,943
It wouldn't even be considered new.
Except maybe in the geological sense.

13
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:23,008
They took from their surroundings
what was needed...

14
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,775
and made of it something more.

15
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:28,512
- We haven't even set up an appointment.
- What order date did you put on this?

16
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,783
- The 28th. Why?
- I don't know... Yeah, I'm putting 28th.

17
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,156
Have you thought any more
about what you want to put forward?

18
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:40,262
- Not really.
- Because I was...

19
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:43,061
I mean I haven't changed my mind
or anything.

20
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,104
Phillip and I were talking,
and we think it could be good. It'd be fun.

21
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:51,704
Nobody's saying it wouldn't be fun.

22
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,871
The time for jacking around with Tesla coils
and ball lightning in the garage is over.

23
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,575
Maybe you should try it on your own
in your free time.

24
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:01,743
My free time? The free time
after the 50 hours a week at work...

25
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:05,846
or after the 30 hours of free time
I already spend in that garage?

26
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:08,248
And it's not a Tesla coil.

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,920
I could save a few minutes a day
by eating on the toilet.

28
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:13,725
How many patents do we have?
In the last 14 months?

29
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:16,733
- Did you sign the agreement?
- Nobody signed the agreement.

30
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,962
Doesn't matter,
we're sticking to the agreement.

31
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,198
Name one thing out of that garage
that's remotely profitable.

32
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:25,640
I don't see anybody quitting their jobs
because of it. Are you?

33
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:28,406
Abe just means that right now
the JTAG cards are it.

34
00:02:28,513 --> 00:02:32,813
When you look at the addresses, we have
a lot of apartments. A lot of residences.

35
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:35,943
But these are not the bulk orders
to the OEMs or retail giants.

36
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:38,249
- These are the quiet basement...
- Hackers.

37
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:41,792
Yeah, hacker wannabes
testing their dads' old motherboards.

38
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:46,964
And I know that a lot of that is my fault,
admittedly, you know.

39
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:48,584
With everything last year,

40
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:51,489
and the doubletalk
we were getting from Platts...

41
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,232
- and all the stuff we won't get into now...
- We should get into it.

42
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:57,597
I'm sorry. What?

43
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:01,141
Go ahead. Tell him.

44
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:05,072
We should get into it.
I talked to my brother today.

45
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,743
He knows of two other cases like that
at his firm.

46
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:09,853
Let Platts know
that we're talking about it.

47
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,174
Look, forget Platts.

48
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:14,679
This has got to be about what
has the best chance of going to market...

49
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,989
and what is going to get us VC attention.

50
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:20,462
Look, I stuck by you guys
when it was your turn.

51
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:23,363
And I wasn't 100% sure
of what we were doing...

52
00:03:23,468 --> 00:03:25,766
or even if I didn't agree, maybe.

53
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,132
But if it's my turn...

54
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:33,105
if we're still playing by the rules,
then this is what I want to try.

55
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,646
Here, take it.
They said it wouldn't hold a freeze.

56
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,877
Robert, please. It's not going to hold.

57
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:44,250
- It's going to go bad in my car.
- It'll go bad here. Okay, thanks.

58
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,050
- Good night, all.
- See you.

59
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:52,390
- We just got done giving this huge speech...
- We gave the speech?

60
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:54,522
We just got done. It was five minutes ago.

61
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:59,399
I'm the one that forced the issue. They're
onto us because I suck as the bad cop.

62
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:02,871
- You should do it. You could fake it better.
- I don't know about that.

63
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:06,341
As long as we're going down this road
where it's eighth grade physics...

64
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:09,902
and happy fun time out in that garage,
I think we could stand to try this.

65
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:13,040
Phillip and Robert are gung ho on theirs,
and that's fine.

66
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,449
But you know I have no interest in that.

67
00:04:15,553 --> 00:04:17,885
I know you have no interest,
besides the fact...

68
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,823
that Phillip and Robert don't even need us.
They just want to use the equipment.

69
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,258
For what I want to do? We don't need them.

70
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:27,160
Not even Phillip,
because it doesn't need software.

71
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,732
- Is she asleep?
- No, and she needs a bath.

72
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:34,503
- She'll wind up in the closet if I do it.
- That's fine.

73
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:38,239
You know, even if Robert's okay with it,
and he won't be.

74
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:42,746
- I don't understand what that thing will do.
- We'll let them go at it for two months.

75
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:45,543
- They do theirs, we do ours.
- They said it'd take 14 hours.

76
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,743
Don't eat that. Seriously, it's bad.

77
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,320
We threw the first couple of batches out.
The filter.

78
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:52,116
What about crushed?

79
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,049
These guys are funded.

80
00:04:55,326 --> 00:04:58,489
- These guys are... What?
- Liquid helium. These guys are funded.

81
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,223
That's what this is.

82
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:02,663
That's the whole difference.
That's what the box is.

83
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,895
We don't have to play the game
where we're going back and forth...

84
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,940
coming up with innovative ways to make it
colder and unusable in the process.

85
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,204
- Aaron, I need the hexagonal set.
- This is unmarketable.

86
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:16,007
By coming at it from the back end,
rather than changing...

87
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:19,277
the surrounding temperature,
we'll change the level it'll conduct...

88
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:22,217
the transition temperature.
And by bombarding these edges...

89
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,517
They're dropping the ceramic,
the temperature lower and lower.

90
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:29,423
It makes the ceramic less resistant
and knocks out the interior magnetic field.

91
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,257
What I'm saying is
we drop the box down on it.

92
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:36,164
Focus our own magnetic field to negate,
knock out with the inverse...

93
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:38,132
what's going on inside the ceramic.

94
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:42,263
That should change the transition
temperature to something we can work with.

95
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:45,809
- What are we saying that is?
- Hopefully, near room temperature.

96
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:49,774
What is that about?
The best mathematician is a lazy one?

97
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:52,611
- What did you ask for?
- I asked. I need the hexagonal set.

98
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:54,378
- What did you call it?
- Just come on.

99
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:56,274
- Are these Type One?
- The superconductors?

100
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,015
Yeah, they're Type One.

101
00:05:58,122 --> 00:05:59,749
Is that going to be a problem?

102
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,725
There's plenty lying around at work,
but they're all bar coded.

103
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:06,422
- If I have to, I'll buy the kits.
- What are you doing about the source?

104
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,862
What?

105
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:11,501
- I can get them.
- You can... Are you sure?

106
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:13,400
I thought you didn't like this idea.

107
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:16,473
Buy them if you have to.
Everything else we can take care of.

108
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:17,939
What about the source here?

109
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,567
You know that story
about how NASA spent millions...

110
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:24,478
developing this pen that writes in zero-G?
Did you ever read that?

111
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:28,018
- And how Russia solved the problem?
- Yeah, they used a pencil.

112
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,219
Right, a normal wooden pencil.

113
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,217
It just seems like Phillip takes
the NASA route almost every time.

114
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:36,987
- Palladium?
- You've got their diagram, what does it say?

115
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:39,029
They use a ratio of platinum and palladium.

116
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,098
That's not necessary
with the changes I made.

117
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,463
They're just showing off.
If you have it, use it.

118
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:45,035
I want to get a replacement router.

119
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:48,230
- I'm putting down four ounces of palladium.
- Did Robert look at it?

120
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,102
- I already got his.
- I can't fix it.

121
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,871
- Okay. Where are you getting it?
- Wal-Mart. It's $50.

122
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,874
- Okay. Can you get a receipt, please?
- Yeah.

123
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:59,211
Wait, platinum or palladium
is less resistant?

124
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:01,376
- Abe? It's not a...
- Yeah, I don't care.

125
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:03,977
- So resistance doesn't matter.
- I need an aye or a yes.

126
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:06,113
- Did you jiggle the...
- The collet nut?

127
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:08,954
- Robert did it.
- Well, yes. I guess.

128
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:12,895
- Well, then, which is cheaper?
- You're not going to buy it, are you?

129
00:07:12,997 --> 00:07:16,364
Well, unless you've got
a few grams of palladium lying around.

130
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,631
Why would they put it in there
if you didn't need it?

131
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:21,796
One catalytic converter. It's fine.

132
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:24,568
Remember to put it back.
Your emission just went up 300%.

133
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,576
- Is there enough in here?
- Yeah, should be.

134
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:30,546
If not, we'll pull the one out of my truck.
Okay, copper tubing.

135
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:41,321
- This will be out of commission, right?
- Without the tubing?

136
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,491
- We can use the Freon, too.
- No, it's going to be room temperature.

137
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:46,654
I know, just in case.

138
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:50,791
No, wait. Stop. I'll just buy the tubing.
This isn't saving us money.

139
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,768
- Jay? Hey, man. How are you?
- Good.

140
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:23,593
Should we be wearing goggles?

141
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,165
- Should we be wearing goggles?
- What?

142
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:30,536
Goggles. Should we be wearing goggles?

143
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,283
Wait. Phillip, you don't want
to come out here.

144
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:42,580
Phillip, grab a mask, okay?

145
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,896
It is, though, right? It's not just me?

146
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:29,326
No, it's definitely smaller,
but it just seems that way.

147
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:31,052
Take what they have.

148
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,769
Minus the coolant which we don't need.

149
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:36,365
The rest of it is the mercury bath...

150
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:40,740
which you would know better than I do,
but they're probably just showing off.

151
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:45,644
I mean, you have it,
you got to use it, right?

152
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:48,951
- What? Does it hurt?
- No, I didn't feel anything.

153
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:51,351
That sound is just weirding me out.

154
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:59,053
- What does it feel like?
- I don't know.

155
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:01,324
I don't know if I'm making it up.

156
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,795
Here.

157
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,947
- Next part. Let's do the next part.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,293
Isn't there some sort of glass
or a transparent...

159
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:34,956
Anything we can use as a window? Pyrex?

160
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,693
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Okay, drop it.

161
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:39,861
I don't know of anything
that won't leave a gap in the field.

162
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,962
But we got to see what's going on in there.

163
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:44,735
- How much did that cost?
- Yeah.

164
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:48,372
- What?
- You want to put my camcorder...

165
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:52,006
inside the box that's so dangerous
we can't look into it.

166
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:58,319
If something happens,
would you pay me back?

167
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:03,216
So we have a slightly negative pressure
in the box.

168
00:11:03,494 --> 00:11:05,359
So we're ready for the argon.

169
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:09,658
- Which one is that?
- It's the blue one.

170
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:13,535
I weighed it at 77 grams.

171
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,901
I set the scale to decagrams, though.

172
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,898
I'm showing 7.7 decagrams.

173
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:22,775
Ready for...

174
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:27,683
0.05 liters of argon.

175
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:38,762
- You ready?
- Just the plate first, right?

176
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:42,064
Right, first just the plate,
and then we'll...

177
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,202
Let's just give it a second.

178
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,551
- You want to do the box now?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:12,389
Let's go through the checklist.
Aaron, hold on a second.

180
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:16,193
Let's make sure everything's set up right.
Hold on, Aaron. Wait.

181
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,402
Just wait.

182
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:32,012
Okay.

183
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:42,891
Anything?

184
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:46,290
- Is this normal?
- I don't know.

185
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:49,624
- I'm turning it off.
- Wait! No.

186
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,471
- Okay, I didn't do that.
- Did we blow something?

187
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:01,570
Yeah, we did. That's destroyed.

188
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,908
- You want to check your camera?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:07,283
- Let's get this.
- You ready?

190
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,715
One, two, three.

191
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,494
Hey. Tell me you're hungry.
Kara's at her mom's and I'm starving.

192
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:29,030
Yeah, I'm hungry. What...

193
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,304
Abe, it's 7:00. Abe, it's 7:00 at night.

194
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:35,809
- Okay, yeah, I have food...
- Okay.

195
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:39,280
- Wait, are those kids there?
- Just a sec.

196
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:41,750
Yeah, they're here.

197
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:45,618
Okay, screw that, let's just go somewhere.
I just pulled in, so come on down.

198
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:48,783
Come up first. I have some stuff
I want to take back to the shop.

199
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:51,020
All right, but meet me at the door.

200
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:54,291
- Okay, all right.
- Seriously, meet me at the door.

201
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,332
Okay. All right. See you.

202
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,814
- What's up, Abe?
- Hey, Brad. How are you?

203
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,142
Good.

204
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,192
- How long did he say he would be there?
- Not long.

205
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:30,324
If he's got problems, he's got to fix them.
You're not his dad.

206
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:34,063
I know. I just thought it would be good
to do something charitable.

207
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:36,969
It definitely is charity.
At least you admit that.

208
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:43,008
You feel like a steak? To eat.

209
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:47,384
I don't want a steak. Let's just
grab some tacos on the way to the shop.

210
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,419
- I have some stuff I want to try out.
- Okay.

211
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,513
We can get some tacos on the way,
or we can get a steak afterwards.

212
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:56,889
What are you talking about?
I'm not paying for a steak.

213
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,223
It's stable?

214
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,902
Aaron, it's stable?

215
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:17,541
- What did you do to this thing?
- What?

216
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,510
- It looks like a dog digested it.
- Okay, that's the plate.

217
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:25,051
I rigged this into the box
so I could control the feed.

218
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:28,250
- I figured it's the easiest way...
- It's just controlling the box.

219
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:32,193
The plate stays the same.
What you do is you gradually feed it.

220
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,896
Okay. You hear that? How it's...

221
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:42,336
See, I'm not touching it anymore.
It's growing with its own momentum.

222
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,000
It's like a feedback loop,
and it just regulates itself.

223
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:48,875
And what you do is when it gets there,
you bring it back...

224
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:53,305
and there you go, it coasts.
It's stable. It stays like that.

225
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:57,519
So it works?

226
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:00,747
- Yeah, it does.
- What is that, like 10%?

227
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:04,221
It knocks another couple of points
by the time it reaches the peak.

228
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,354
You may want to come over here
and take a look at this.

229
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,123
Okay, what am I looking at?

230
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:12,532
- What are we pulling out of the batteries?
- Probably 24 volts.

231
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,002
- I mean, no more than that, right?
- Okay.

232
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,800
So your meter's jacked up.

233
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,620
That's what I figured.
So I tried three others.

234
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,098
I got the exact same thing.

235
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:23,009
- I spent all last night...
- What was it?

236
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:26,844
I spent last night and a two-hour break
just double-checking everything.

237
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:30,944
There's something wrong here. We're not
pulling out more than we're putting in.

238
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:33,285
- Slightly more.
- Well, yeah, whatever.

239
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,291
It's not like a volt and a half
more than we're putting in.

240
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:37,817
It's probably the batteries.

241
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,377
They're cheap batteries,
not regulated right.

242
00:16:40,598 --> 00:16:42,156
That is weird, though.

243
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,562
You want to see something weirder?

244
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:51,740
Okay, let's go over this again.
Two batteries, right? 24 volts?

245
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,704
What are we pulling out of this one?
Just for fun.

246
00:16:58,415 --> 00:16:59,905
Twelve volts.

247
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:13,421
- How about this one?
- Should be 12 volts.

248
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,197
So, what the hell is this thing?

249
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:27,377
It doesn't stay like that.

250
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:31,045
No, it winds down in a few minutes.
What does that?

251
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:40,046
I don't know. I'll tell them something.
I'll tell them we're spraying for bugs.

252
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:42,523
It should just be a day or two, anyways.

253
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:46,920
- Unless you want to bring them in.
- No, they have their work in there, too.

254
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:50,194
If Phillip finds out about that
he's going to have to take it apart.

255
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:54,704
- No. I'm just putting a little tweak on it.
- Yeah, I know. No, you're right.

256
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,742
Abe, it's my garage, okay?
It's not like they're paying rent.

257
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:03,339
There was value in the thing.
Clearly. Of that they were certain of.

258
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,779
But what is the application?
In a matter of hours...

259
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:09,375
they had pinned it to everything
from mass transit to satellite launching.

260
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,681
Imagining devices the size of jumbo jets.

261
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:14,849
Everything would be cheaper.
It was practical and they knew it.

262
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,018
But above all that, beyond the positives...

263
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:19,288
they knew that the easiest way
to be exploited...

264
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:21,660
is to sell something
they did not yet understand.

265
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:25,223
So they kept quiet.
The parties would continue.

266
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,896
Any birthday, anniversary, holiday...

267
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:31,941
maybe some obscure project launch.
It didn't matter. Any reason would do.

268
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:36,512
What was important is that Thomas Granger,
their last best hope of funding, show up.

269
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:40,983
If he left a little earlier than
they would've liked, he couldn't be blamed.

270
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:44,111
He was only there
to please his daughter Rachel.

271
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,781
And she was only there to please Abe.

272
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:51,285
What did you say
to Mr. Granger a while ago?

273
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:54,159
- Did you flip my burger?
- You can't call him Mr. Granger.

274
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:56,425
You have to call him, like,
Thomas or something.

275
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:59,434
- Go ahead.
- No, because he won't take you seriously.

276
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,232
- He thinks we're kids.
- If you call him Mr. Granger...

277
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,732
he looks at you like
you're a 6-year-old kid.

278
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,098
He does it with me.
It won't work anymore.

279
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:11,974
Abe had taken on the task
of quantifying and explaining the device.

280
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,815
But as weeks became months...

281
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:19,218
their enthusiasm became a slow realization
that they were out of their depth.

282
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,364
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

283
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:07,494
- Where'd you call?
- Your work and your cell.

284
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,739
I'm not there.

285
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:12,102
Really?

286
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:17,047
- March Madness?
- It's Carolina and Michigan.

287
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:19,274
- Who's up?
- I don't even know what.

288
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,911
Do you have anything important
at work today?

289
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,956
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

290
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:31,759
I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...

291
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:34,831
friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.

292
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,559
But how about this instead?

293
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:40,865
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

294
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:43,701
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

295
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:46,469
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

296
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:50,969
Well, it looks like mustard to me.

297
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:53,413
I know, but it's a film. It's a protein...

298
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:56,418
secreted by a fungus
called Aspergillus Ticor.

299
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,544
He told you that?

300
00:20:57,654 --> 00:21:00,623
No, he knew it was a protein
but didn't know where it came from.

301
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:03,887
All he really did was just take
some pictures with their equipment.

302
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,325
Guess where we're going.

303
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,795
- Do you know where Will is?
- No, why?

304
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:10,230
The Ariel meeting
is pushed back till Wednesday.

305
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,098
I thought he was waiting around for it.
Where are you going?

306
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:15,433
What do they do with engineers
when they turn 40?

307
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,939
- What, Bradshaw?
- Exactly. You know what?

308
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,942
I do know where Will is.
I'll let him know on my way out.

309
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:23,274
- Okay. Thanks.
- Can you meet me out front?

310
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,474
- You got to drive.
- Okay, here. Take my keys.

311
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:30,781
Okay, if you can, just pretend
that this is the first time I came in.

312
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:34,413
And if you would just
tell him exactly what you told me...

313
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:38,626
- Okay, so what is it?
- Protein buildup.

314
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:42,358
- Okay, can you just tell him?
- Protein buildup.

315
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,630
- But what kind?
- Some fungus.

316
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:48,667
- Some fungus.
- Where did it come from?

317
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,364
I don't know.
You were to take it to the lab.

318
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,730
Yeah, that's next.

319
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,574
- You were in design, weren't you?
- Yeah.

320
00:21:55,946 --> 00:21:57,504
How did you get over here?

321
00:21:57,614 --> 00:22:00,811
Do you know what they do
with engineers when they turn 40?

322
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:02,745
They take them out and shoot them.

323
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:05,822
What the hell, Abe?
You could have just shown me the pictures.

324
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:09,586
- I want you to believe it.
- Believe what, the protein?

325
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,488
- I believe you.
- Okay, look...

326
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:15,031
this guy already thinks it's a joke,
so he may be a little defensive.

327
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:17,464
Really? Why would he think that?

328
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,613
Please.

329
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,449
Aspergillus Ticor.

330
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:38,180
This is a fungus that's everywhere.

331
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:43,122
It's in our bed, our skin,
sometimes even our GI tract. Everywhere.

332
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:48,530
It's basically the reason you don't leave
things in dark, damp, closed-off places.

333
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:51,463
Thank you.
Do you have that sample I brought?

334
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,732
There it is. Terger. T-E-R-G-E-R.

335
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:04,038
Okay, when I showed you this,
tell him what you thought.

336
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:09,914
- You thought it was a joke, right?
- It is a joke.

337
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:12,846
Right, but how did you know?

338
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,291
Will you show him? Please?

339
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:30,840
This is how I get protein A
out of Aspergillus Ticor. We sweeten it.

340
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:33,774
We agitate it. We spin it around.
We sweeten some more.

341
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:37,108
- Takes about a month.
- To get the same amount I brought in.

342
00:23:38,148 --> 00:23:39,740
To get the same amount I brought in.

343
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,250
So if it's an incubator for fungus,
is that valuable?

344
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:44,149
- That's not what it is.
- Then what is it?

345
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:47,621
There's another way to secrete
that much protein. Do it naturally.

346
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:49,954
But that takes a lot longer.

347
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:52,640
If it has a little moisture
and it's left alone,

348
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,052
it'll start secreting
and it'll build up...

349
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:57,532
- and build up, but it takes a long time.
- How long?

350
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:00,501
- A long time.
- More than a few days? Then how long?

351
00:24:00,604 --> 00:24:02,868
To get the same amount of protein
that we have...

352
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:05,271
the amount that I was wiping off
every five days...

353
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,570
and five days later it would accumulate...

354
00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:10,340
he says it would take
about five to six years.

355
00:24:13,216 --> 00:24:14,740
I don't want to belittle this guy.

356
00:24:14,851 --> 00:24:17,547
So, I said screw it
and I put my watch in there.

357
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:20,215
- And?
- I want you to do it.

358
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:23,757
- Where is it? The box?
- I took it back to the shop.

359
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:29,356
- Wait, digital or old mechanical?
- Exactly. I did both.

360
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:33,101
- And what?
- I want you to do it.

361
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:38,036
We thought
that we were degrading gravity, right?

362
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:40,132
That we were blocking that information.

363
00:24:40,243 --> 00:24:43,872
I think we're doing more than that.
I think we're blocking more than that.

364
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:48,111
When you were controlling the feed,
did you notice it was parabolic?

365
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:51,650
It's important. Parabolas are important.
Here, look at this.

366
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:54,156
I don't know, Abe.

367
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:56,885
I'm going to start it up
and let it run for 60 seconds...

368
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:59,258
with nothing in it.
It's empty this time.

369
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:00,352
That's 22...

370
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:03,194
In all the equations that describe motion
and heat and entropy.

371
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,827
In all Feynman diagrams what's the
one variable that you can turn negative...

372
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:09,405
and still get rational answers for?
It's not mass.

373
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:12,304
Twenty-two hours,
27 minutes in the box.

374
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:15,908
- It's odd, it's an odd number.
- That's 1,347 minutes.

375
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:20,941
- 1,347, man, you got that fast.
- How did you know it's odd?

376
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:25,112
Because this is it. This is what's going on.
There's an "A" end and a "B" end.

377
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:28,191
Let's say the A end is 12:00,
and the B end is 12:01.

378
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:31,192
All right? We start the machine
with the Weeble at the A end.

379
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:33,728
- It travels forward...
- You got to write this down.

380
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,264
- There's nothing to write down.
- I'll write it down.

381
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:38,425
It travels forward normally
towards the B end.

382
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:40,969
When it gets there,
the feed runs down parabolically...

383
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:44,199
until it should stop, but it curves
back around towards the A end.

384
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:47,470
When it gets back to the A end...
Curve that around. The Weeble...

385
00:25:47,577 --> 00:25:50,910
has experienced a total of two minutes,
and again it curves...

386
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:53,141
- Back around. It curves parabolically.
- Right.

387
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,878
It comes back around
and it does this about 1,300 times.

388
00:25:55,986 --> 00:25:57,715
When it finally exits on the B end...

389
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:00,654
it's traveled an odd number
of forward and backward trips.

390
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:04,193
What is so special about 1,300?
Why is it about 1,300? Why isn't it exact?

391
00:26:04,294 --> 00:26:06,353
- This is not empirical.
- Here, give me that.

392
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:10,263
I don't know why it's not exact.
There's some sort of probability there.

393
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:12,892
Every time it hits the B end
there's a chance...

394
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:15,904
a small chance it won't
curve back around towards the A end.

395
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:19,703
And for some reason, it takes
about 1,300 trips before it finally does.

396
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,109
It does have to exit, or else
we wouldn't be able to see it afterwards.

397
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,204
Okay, let's take a look at this.

398
00:26:25,882 --> 00:26:28,180
Twenty-two hours, 14 minutes.

399
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:35,385
- 1,334 minutes.
- Even.

400
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:39,490
Enter at the B end.

401
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:43,194
Exit at the B end.

402
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:49,604
- I just want you to see it the way I saw it.
- I am trying, okay?

403
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:52,174
Everything we're putting in that box
comes ungrounded.

404
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:55,039
And I don't mean grounded to the earth,
I mean not tethered.

405
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:58,308
We're blocking whatever keeps it
moving forward, so they flip-flop.

406
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,543
Inside the box, it's like a street,
and both ends are cul-de-sacs.

407
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:05,644
This isn't frame dragging or wormhole
matching. It's basic mechanics and heat.

408
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:07,848
This is not mechanics and heat.

409
00:27:12,162 --> 00:27:15,723
- We can publish.
- Yeah, we can publish.

410
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:18,323
No, I mean we can really publish.

411
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:21,502
Aaron, the Weeble's stupid.
It can't move.

412
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:24,199
Even if we were
to put the Weeble in at point B...

413
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:29,006
it's still going to bounce back and forth
until it's kicked out at the B end.

414
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,174
But if it were smart...

415
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:40,217
it could enter at the B end
and exit at the A end before it flips back.

416
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:48,357
You're talking about making a bigger one.

417
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:52,999
I didn't say anything.
You're the one talking about it.

418
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:56,029
So, you believe me?

419
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:59,370
No, I don't.

420
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:01,909
Come on. Let's go get a drink or something.

421
00:28:06,983 --> 00:28:09,417
- We're going to have to move it.
- We will.

422
00:28:12,822 --> 00:28:15,245
We need a box big enough for a person
to fit into. As far as turning it on...

423
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:18,556
I was testing the box. It turns out
over half the rings are redundant.

424
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:22,120
The inner ring is strong enough on its own,
so it makes the plate smaller.

425
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,325
A lot more is unnecessary.
What we can do...

426
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:28,734
is take a lot of these small plates and
surround a container with a web of them.

427
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:31,268
How small?

428
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:35,569
It should be accumulative so a lot of
mini-fields equal one big one, right?

429
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,247
Yeah, sum of series, that makes sense.

430
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:41,784
What I was going to say is we need
to find a place where we can put it...

431
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:43,750
and turn it on and it won't be disturbed.

432
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:45,946
We could just lock it in a closet.

433
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:50,087
Someplace where someone's not going to
go poking around and messing with it.

434
00:28:50,193 --> 00:28:51,854
And climate-controlled.

435
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:54,895
Yeah, so whatever, we'll find some place.

436
00:28:55,265 --> 00:28:58,200
So, if we go your route with what?
A bunch of mini-fields?

437
00:28:58,301 --> 00:29:02,032
That's a lot of work. We'd have to...
I mean, how many days is that?

438
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:06,670
Abe, you know what we could use?

439
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:11,113
I know we've seen
a lot of crazy things lately, okay?

440
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:15,150
I know you're still trying to put
it all together in a way that makes sense.

441
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:18,847
Look, I just want you to understand
that what's next is not a prank, okay?

442
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:21,719
I wouldn't do that to you
and I'm not doing that to you.

443
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:26,620
So when you see this, you can't yell
or make any noise or run anywhere, ok?

444
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,754
I know you probably feel like you're being
tricked or made fun of. But you're not, ok?

445
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,601
I promise you, you're not. Okay?

446
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:01,561
Who was that, Abe?

447
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:28,653
Let's just wait. Six minutes.

448
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,680
Look, you sure you're okay to drive?

449
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,953
What did you do all day?
The first time through?

450
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,929
I spent the day
in a hotel room in Russellfield.

451
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:49,000
- I'll just meet you back at the shop.
- I wonder what I did.

452
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,066
- I guess I went back to work.
- Yeah, probably.

453
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:56,111
Probably just worked, I guess.

454
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,178
Yeah, probably so.

455
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:06,011
Look, now that I know about this, Abe...

456
00:32:06,623 --> 00:32:09,456
don't do this again, okay?
Not where it affects me.

457
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,621
Go ahead.

458
00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:22,670
Hey, Rachel.

459
00:33:05,014 --> 00:33:06,675
Why not the lottery?

460
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,780
We can if you want,
but it's not until Saturday.

461
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:14,414
And even if we win the full $10 million,
that's only $200,000 for the next 30 years.

462
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:18,258
- And that's just one good trade.
- A couple days like this.

463
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:21,762
- I was just running a test. In and out.
- I want to do what you did.

464
00:33:21,865 --> 00:33:23,264
Exactly what you did.

465
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:26,267
- The first thing I did is call in sick.
- Okay, I did that.

466
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:30,237
- Then I drove to the storage facility.
- But I need to drop Lauren at school first.

467
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,934
Then meet me there.
We're going to need both cars.

468
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:36,136
We need to park yours down the road,
out of sight of the facility.

469
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:39,147
- Why are we doing that?
- Because we need a ride home.

470
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:40,807
- What is that...
- It'll make sense.

471
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:43,112
Okay, I'll be patient.

472
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:46,711
When I got to the storage room,
I flooded the box with argon...

473
00:33:46,823 --> 00:33:50,554
and I had to tighten it up
to secure the leaks.

474
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,552
- There's leaks?
- There's always leaks.

475
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,996
At 8:30 a.m.,
I set the timer for 15 minutes...

476
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:05,506
I jumped in the car,
and drove to Russellfield.

477
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:06,868
Okay, I lost it.

478
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,638
- What?
- Why the timer?

479
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:13,881
Because the moment we start those
machines is the moment we'll end up...

480
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:16,713
- getting out of them, and-
- Right. Got it. Sorry.

481
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:19,515
I don't want to be standing around
when they do.

482
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:24,960
While I was on the road at 8:45,
the machine kicked on by itself...

483
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:29,123
and by 8:49, it was completely warmed up.

484
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:41,502
In Russellfield, I got a hotel room
and tried to isolate myself.

485
00:34:42,211 --> 00:34:43,974
Wait, what do you mean "isolate"?

486
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,776
I closed the windows,
I unplugged everything in the room...

487
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:48,851
the telephone, TV, clock, radio, everything.

488
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:51,944
I didn't want to take the chance
of running into someone I knew...

489
00:34:52,055 --> 00:34:54,023
or seeing something on the news
that might...

490
00:34:54,123 --> 00:34:58,025
If we're dealing with causality,
and I don't even know for sure.

491
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,322
- I just...
- What?

492
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,893
- Took myself out of the equation.
- Err on the side of caution.

493
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,092
Yes.

494
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,730
Then what did you do all day?

495
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:15,471
- I just sat there. I had some books, but...
- What? Were you nervous?

496
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:18,706
Yeah.
It's mind-numbing, all the second-guessing.

497
00:35:23,653 --> 00:35:25,086
"Evacipate."

498
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:33,753
At 3:30 p.m.,
I stopped by Williams Medical Supply.

499
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:35,956
Picked up a Class E oxygen tank and mask.

500
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:39,728
I called my mutual fund company and asked
which stock in their mid-cap fund...

501
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:41,736
had the greatest percentage gain that day.

502
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:44,807
The idea was just to get enough information
for one good trade.

503
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:47,603
Can we just download chart data
and trade on each movement?

504
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:52,147
But if we do that, I want to use the library
in Russellfield, use their computers.

505
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:10,359
So, I got to the storage room at about 3:15
and cut off the power to the box.

506
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:14,134
It cycled down to a tolerable level
at about 3:19.

507
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:17,363
The trick is to get in
after it reaches a comfortable level...

508
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:20,772
but before it shuts off completely.
There's a window there.

509
00:36:20,943 --> 00:36:22,877
So, does it hurt?

510
00:36:24,313 --> 00:36:26,008
Yeah, it does a little.

511
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:30,011
It's not bad if you wait for the right time.
It's like a small static shock.

512
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,679
- Once you're in, you're fine, though.
- What?

513
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:36,219
I know you've done it,
and I can only assume that you don't have...

514
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:38,293
cancer or male impotence.

515
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:41,090
But what is your opinion
on how safe this thing is?

516
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:43,563
I can imagine no way
in which this thing would be...

517
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,793
considered anywhere remotely close to safe.

518
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:49,394
All I know is I spent six hours in there
and I'm still alive.

519
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:53,908
You still want to do it?

520
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:13,591
I set the alarm on my stopwatch
for six hours.

521
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:17,792
I regulated the O2 tank,
took some Dramamine, and tried to sleep.

522
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:19,730
Did you?

523
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:21,902
- What?
- Did you sleep?

524
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:26,341
Not at first. I've never
considered myself claustrophobic...

525
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:30,572
but I started sweating and I couldn't find
the right flow rate on the tank...

526
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:35,108
and I was breathing differently than I was
when I was testing it on the outside.

527
00:37:35,218 --> 00:37:37,618
Eventually, I settled down, and...

528
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:41,946
I don't know, maybe it was the Dramamine
kicking in, but I remember this moment...

529
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:44,856
in the dark
with the reverberation of the machine.

530
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:48,397
It was maybe the most content
I've ever been.

531
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:53,500
I woke up on my own without the alarm...

532
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:57,095
and waited for the machine to cool down.
Cool down from my perspective.

533
00:37:57,206 --> 00:38:00,073
It got to a point where it sounded safe
to get out...

534
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:02,736
but the stopwatch still showed
a couple minutes...

535
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,211
so I trusted the math and waited.

536
00:38:41,384 --> 00:38:45,081
That's not a static shock, Abe.
Okay, please stop it.

537
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,089
You got out too soon.

538
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,557
You have to wait for the stopwatch
so that you know the gain is low enough.

539
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,663
So, we're back here?

540
00:39:01,103 --> 00:39:04,664
Yeah, we're here.
It's 8:50, Tuesday morning.

541
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:10,837
All right. Give me a few minutes.

542
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:17,443
From there it was easy.
The bulk of the work was done.

543
00:39:17,553 --> 00:39:20,886
I just left everything the way I found it.
I left the machine alone...

544
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,959
and didn't turn it off,
and just cleared out of there.

545
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,497
So your double would find everything
the same later that day and get in the box?

546
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:33,126
Right, but also, I or my double or someone
was in the box coming backwards.

547
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:36,467
So who knows what that would've done
if I'd turned the machine off.

548
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:39,063
Definitely. So, they're one-time use only.

549
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:43,578
So then, at that moment, since my double
was on the way to the hotel in my car...

550
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,706
I had to take a taxi home. But when we go,
we'll be able to use your truck.

551
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,733
- You have a margin account, right?
- Yeah. I do now. What are we buying?

552
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:15,743
Good. Today, before 12:30,
we'll buy as many shares as we can of RGWU.

553
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:21,510
They'll say their earnings that quarter
are three and a half times consensus...

554
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:24,609
and the stock will nearly double
in afternoon trading.

555
00:40:26,522 --> 00:40:28,649
- What do they do?
- What do you mean?

556
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:31,055
What does this company do?
Do they make things or...

557
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,754
I don't know.
All that matters is the price goes up.

558
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:38,562
The volume is so high that the number
of shares we trade won't affect the price.

559
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:43,431
You really don't know what they do?

560
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:52,811
That's why you spoke about a mid-cap fund,
so volume is high enough to hide us.

561
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:55,008
- Do you think it's too cautious?
- I don't know.

562
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:57,312
I know there's a lot of other stocks
out there...

563
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,617
that do a lot more than double,
but this is my first day.

564
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,091
- My God.
- She's not going to answer.

565
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:41,957
I know, Abe. That's the question.

566
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,092
I know, so what's the answer?
You've got the $400 billion...

567
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:50,798
you've gone the charity route,
you have this perfect 100-room mansion...

568
00:41:50,906 --> 00:41:53,272
with matching his and her yachts
and helicopter pads.

569
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:56,345
Basically, you have absolute impunity
to do whatever you want...

570
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:57,434
nobody can touch you.

571
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:59,605
- You're back from a two-year...
- Above the law.

572
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:04,584
Absolutely, well above. You're fresh back
from this two-year world-galloping vacation.

573
00:42:04,687 --> 00:42:06,746
How do you fill your day? What do you do?

574
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:09,977
Abe, I know that's the question,
but it's not a real question,

575
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:11,313
so why does it matter?

576
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:12,792
So what's the answer?

577
00:42:12,895 --> 00:42:16,829
Babe, he knows that's the question, okay?
He's asking you the question.

578
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:20,594
What do you mean? What would I do
with my life or what would I do tomorrow?

579
00:42:20,703 --> 00:42:21,965
My God, either.

580
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:27,665
I'd have to do something constructive.
I'd have to do something that would help...

581
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:31,440
- something that would make me feel good.
- I know. That's fantastic. Good.

582
00:42:31,547 --> 00:42:36,416
- My wife. So good. So pure. You are pure.
- Shut up. Why did you ask, then?

583
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:40,850
This is what I would do:
I would wake up tomorrow morning...

584
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:43,390
and I'd go over to Gabriel Capital Inc...

585
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:47,258
and I would tell Joseph Platts' receptionist
that I'm there to see him...

586
00:42:47,363 --> 00:42:49,058
and when he comes out...

587
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:53,399
I would ram my fist
through the flat of his nose.

588
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,363
Just one good punch, one good pow.

589
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:03,106
- That's amazing. It's about time.
- That is so great.

590
00:43:03,212 --> 00:43:05,908
Where did this come from?
You're always defending the guy.

591
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:08,575
- It's unnatural.
- I'd only do it if I knew that...

592
00:43:08,684 --> 00:43:10,413
no one would find out or get hurt.

593
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:13,886
Like, I wish that there was a way
that I could do it...

594
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:15,820
and then I go back and tell myself not to.

595
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:19,019
Because I just want to know
what it feels like. That's all, really.

596
00:43:19,128 --> 00:43:20,322
I'm so proud.

597
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:24,223
Finally, my husband, the hero.

598
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:33,670
- We can't do that.
- I know.

599
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:35,738
Did you call pest control?

600
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:40,379
Babe, they're birds. You don't want a bunch
of dead baby birds up there, do you?

601
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:44,510
- They don't sound like birds.
- She thinks there are rats in the attic.

602
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:47,512
But the idea had been spoken...

603
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:50,751
and the words wouldn't go back
after they had been uttered aloud.

604
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,452
So you are understanding this, right?

605
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:55,086
You don't have to sell me
on not doing this, okay?

606
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:58,223
- I don't think I told you...
- Even if you do stop yourself...

607
00:43:58,334 --> 00:44:01,895
your double, from hitting Platts,
why would he, your double, get in the box?

608
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:05,462
And with no need for it,
no possible real-world application...

609
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:09,232
no advantage at all to be gained from it,
the idea stayed.

610
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:13,337
- How would you do it?
- I wouldn't.

611
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:16,273
- Just for fun.
- I still wouldn't.

612
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:19,218
- But what if there was a way to...
- Look, Abe, look.

613
00:44:19,688 --> 00:44:22,816
I'm not going to pretend
like I know anything about paradoxes...

614
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:26,326
or what follows them, and honestly,
I really don't believe in that crap.

615
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:30,228
Kill your mom before you were born,
whatever. It has to work itself out somehow.

616
00:44:30,332 --> 00:44:32,459
- I don't know.
- This is what I know for sure.

617
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:36,629
The worst thing in the world is to know
that the moment you are experiencing...

618
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:39,537
has already been defined,
that this is the second...

619
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:43,544
or third time through, or whatever.
And do you ever feel like...

620
00:44:44,613 --> 00:44:48,379
I don't know, maybe things aren't right,
like maybe your life is in disarray...

621
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:52,648
or just not what you would like
and you start to wonder what caused this.

622
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:55,983
People are always blaming their parents...

623
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:59,390
as if, if their mom had breastfed them,
their lives would be different.

624
00:44:59,495 --> 00:45:00,655
Bunch of whiners.

625
00:45:00,763 --> 00:45:03,926
Yeah, they are. But what if it wasn't
something you wonder about?

626
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:07,025
What if you knew this is not the way
things are supposed to be?

627
00:45:07,136 --> 00:45:11,266
I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole
"destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing.

628
00:45:11,373 --> 00:45:13,273
I'm not, either. But what's worse?

629
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:16,469
Thinking you're being paranoid
or knowing you should be?

630
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:25,148
You don't have to look at me like that.
I'm okay.

631
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:34,125
No, I just assumed that you would.
I trust her.

632
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,030
- I know that when I decided to tell you...
- Decided to tell?

633
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,375
I knew that you are married
and that there's no secrets.

634
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:43,259
Anything I tell you, she'll know.

635
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:44,894
- It's not a matter of trust.
- I know.

636
00:45:44,974 --> 00:45:47,602
It's just how much better will it be
if in a few days...

637
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,168
I surprise her and we all just fly
to Costa Rica or somewhere for a month?

638
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,807
We'll let her understand it gradually.
Maybe do some real estate shopping...

639
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:57,818
For now, you can tell her
you had a good day in the market.

640
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,020
- You don't understand.
- No.

641
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,568
You don't understand the questions
that come with that.

642
00:46:01,657 --> 00:46:04,182
But we'll explain it to her,
and we'll take some time...

643
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:05,487
to figure out what's next...

644
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:09,155
which, I think, should be building
a bigger box, like the size of a room...

645
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:11,096
where more than one person could fit in.

646
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,328
Safe or not,
the thing feels like a coffin the way it is.

647
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,833
By the way, this is our guy.

648
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:21,706
- What's the volume?
- Five-and-a-half.

649
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:24,939
What's the return? Holy...

650
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:32,049
No, I can't beat that. But mainly, I guess
I was just talking about Robert and Phillip.

651
00:46:32,154 --> 00:46:33,348
I don't want to tell them.

652
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,719
I know they have a lot invested
in the group...

653
00:46:35,824 --> 00:46:37,189
I don't want to tell them.

654
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,524
If you need me to take
the guilt on this one, fine, okay?

655
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:42,392
I accept it gladly. It's mine.

656
00:46:42,498 --> 00:46:45,160
At the end of this week,
they can have whatever they want.

657
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:48,532
I'll turn over patent rights on everything
from the last two years.

658
00:46:48,637 --> 00:46:51,003
They can have the equipment,
the garage, the house.

659
00:46:51,106 --> 00:46:53,973
They can have my truck
if that makes you feel better.

660
00:46:54,076 --> 00:46:57,170
But I am not telling them a thing
about this. We're not.

661
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,190
God, everything is so different in there.

662
00:47:14,296 --> 00:47:16,355
You can feel how cut off you are.

663
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:19,668
It's this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it.

664
00:47:19,768 --> 00:47:23,226
And the sound.
Isn't the sound different on the inside?

665
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:26,738
It's like it's singing.
I guess you can't hear it on the outside...

666
00:47:26,842 --> 00:47:30,369
- I had this dream in there.
- About what?

667
00:47:32,247 --> 00:47:36,911
I was on or near the ocean,
and I just kept hearing the surf.

668
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:38,909
It was so uneventful.

669
00:47:39,722 --> 00:47:42,691
At night.
And the tide kept coming in and out.

670
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:58,235
Come here for a second, man.
What's on your hand?

671
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:00,604
- Are you bleeding?
- That is blood.

672
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:02,267
- Turn around.
- You see it?

673
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,778
Where is it coming from? It's your notebook.

674
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,974
- It's you. My gosh, it's on your ear.
- What is this?

675
00:48:08,317 --> 00:48:11,616
- Your ear's bleeding. Man.
- Give me that. I got it.

676
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:18,159
- Is that normal? This isn't normal.
- For the machine?

677
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:22,327
For people.
You think it's the machine? I got it.

678
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:42,441
Great. I can actually
get some work done today.

679
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:43,916
Hi, guys, what's going on?

680
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:46,852
I always seem to get a lot more done
when I'm not locked out.

681
00:48:46,955 --> 00:48:48,388
He says they had to spray again.

682
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:51,459
But he can't tell us about it in advance.
Is Hero even here?

683
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,892
You never see anything around here
but those geckos.

684
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:55,623
- I know.
- I think it's for the geckos.

685
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:57,096
- What?
- Why?

686
00:48:57,266 --> 00:49:00,497
- Hey, man, thanks for the present.
- How is that working out for you?

687
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:04,333
You know what? You guys, both of you,
you make fun, but there is a difference.

688
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,702
Wait. What did you call him?

689
00:49:05,808 --> 00:49:07,867
- What?
- When you walked in? What did you say?

690
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:09,443
- He didn't tell you about it?
- No.

691
00:49:09,545 --> 00:49:13,675
All right. Rachel's ex-boyfriend
walks into my birthday party with a shotgun.

692
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:15,215
- What?
- Swear to God.

693
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:17,114
I've already gotten that speech from Kara.

694
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,585
- Filby!
- You'll get it. You have a wife and kid.

695
00:49:19,688 --> 00:49:22,987
It's funny how you two are the only people
that have a problem with it.

696
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:25,559
- Everybody else thinks I did a good thing.
- You didn't.

697
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:29,062
You can't risk your life and
especially the welfare of Kara and Lauren...

698
00:49:29,164 --> 00:49:30,188
for someone like Rachel.

699
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:32,358
She practically begs
for this to happen to her.

700
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:34,060
I figured at least you'd understand.

701
00:49:34,169 --> 00:49:36,137
Understand what?
You've never been like this.

702
00:49:36,238 --> 00:49:39,935
That's what I mean.
You see how different things are now.

703
00:49:40,609 --> 00:49:42,770
Different? How are things different?

704
00:49:43,512 --> 00:49:46,379
You see it, okay? I know you do.

705
00:49:49,017 --> 00:49:50,780
Look, that was the night...

706
00:49:51,487 --> 00:49:53,478
you had told me everything
about the machine.

707
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:57,286
Everything you showed me was so fresh
in my head and when I saw this guy...

708
00:49:57,392 --> 00:49:59,952
I'm looking at him.
I wasn't going to let him do that.

709
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:02,826
I wasn't going
to let him scare people like that.

710
00:50:03,265 --> 00:50:05,165
I know it was stupid, okay?

711
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:08,803
But I mean, this whole idea,
this whole thing that we're doing.

712
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:13,933
It just took some getting used to for me.
I wasn't completely acclimated to it.

713
00:50:14,076 --> 00:50:17,568
If it was just you, you had to worry about,
I'd still think you're stupid.

714
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,546
But you have a family now,
and God, especially now...

715
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:22,480
anything like this would be crazy.

716
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,576
- I know, okay.
- I know you know that, but you've got to...

717
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:28,713
- I know, okay?
- Filby!

718
00:50:31,393 --> 00:50:34,851
You little sack of...
Even if you see him, don't tell me.

719
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:38,592
It's not my fault if I don't know,
and I just hope the thing runs away.

720
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,429
Then what are we doing out here?

721
00:50:40,536 --> 00:50:44,370
She worries about the cat.
So you look for the cat. It's what you do.

722
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:56,283
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

723
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:59,684
It's embarrassing that the storage room guy
sees us come in together...

724
00:50:59,788 --> 00:51:00,982
but he never sees us leave.

725
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:03,557
Yeah, but what do you think
the receptionist thinks...

726
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:07,151
about two guys that come
and get a room for six hours every day?

727
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:12,066
Did you unplug this?

728
00:51:15,938 --> 00:51:18,065
You brought your cell phone?

729
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:21,566
Can I check the caller ID?

730
00:51:23,612 --> 00:51:25,375
Yeah, we're not back.

731
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:29,382
Yeah, but you can't take it back
with you, okay?

732
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:36,321
This is Aaron. Hey, babe.

733
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:41,424
I'm not there. I had to come downtown
and hold some of these guys' hands.

734
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,724
Tell me.

735
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:44,726
That sounds good.

736
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:47,289
No, I've got to
eat with these offsite fags.

737
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:49,767
Save mine, though. I'll have it later.

738
00:51:50,138 --> 00:51:54,598
Okay. Yeah, 6:00.

739
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:59,373
- What?
- What?

740
00:52:59,608 --> 00:53:03,408
We're supposed to win this by two,
they just turned over with 12 on the clock.

741
00:53:03,512 --> 00:53:07,380
- We have to foul.
- No.

742
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:11,446
What? No, we foul here,
they miss the first free throw...

743
00:53:11,553 --> 00:53:13,714
- and they come back with the three.
- Three points.

744
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:15,016
That's right.

745
00:53:21,396 --> 00:53:24,627
Man, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.

746
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:29,669
What's up, you guys?

747
00:53:37,245 --> 00:53:40,612
- You have got to be kidding.
- I'm sorry. I forgot it was in my pocket.

748
00:53:40,716 --> 00:53:42,377
- It's Kara?
- Yeah.

749
00:53:45,854 --> 00:53:47,412
How do cell phones work?

750
00:53:47,522 --> 00:53:50,389
If there's two duplicate phones
and I call the same number...

751
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:52,756
do they both ring at the same time,
or is there...

752
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:55,022
- That's not how they work.
- It's a radio signal.

753
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,392
No, it's a network.

754
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:59,558
It checks each area and
when it finds the phone, it stops ringing.

755
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:01,260
It rings the first one.

756
00:54:03,705 --> 00:54:06,469
- This one is ringing.
- Right.

757
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:08,873
So the one your double has in Russellfield
can't be.

758
00:54:08,977 --> 00:54:11,036
Right. I think we broke symmetry.

759
00:54:12,347 --> 00:54:15,612
- Are you sure that's how cell phones work?
- No.

760
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:19,014
You feel all right?

761
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:21,982
- I feel fine. Do you?
- Yeah.

762
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:53,314
Is Kara asleep? Did I wake you up?

763
00:54:53,421 --> 00:54:57,357
Yeah. No, not me, it felt more like a nap.

764
00:54:57,959 --> 00:55:01,292
I think my body's getting used to
these 36-hour days. What's going on?

765
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:03,660
We can do this, but we have to do it now.

766
00:55:03,765 --> 00:55:06,529
- Do you have his home address?
- Why now?

767
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:09,832
We were planning on taking a trip
tomorrow, right? Just like today?

768
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:11,166
Yeah, for stocks.

769
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:15,710
Okay, well, half an hour ago I was asleep.
This car alarm woke me up.

770
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:18,575
These kids were down skating by,
hitting cars on the block.

771
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,639
So we go right now, do our business
at Platts', get back in the box...

772
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:25,276
and come back before
those kids set off those alarms.

773
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:29,346
All we really have to do is stand there
in plain sight. That should scare them off.

774
00:55:29,457 --> 00:55:31,425
That way my double
sleeps through the night...

775
00:55:31,526 --> 00:55:35,986
they don't have this conversation,
and they get in the box tomorrow as usual.

776
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,365
- They'll be changed. But...
- Yeah, but at least they'll get in the box.

777
00:55:43,672 --> 00:55:47,438
Wait, how do we go back that far
if the machines haven't been running?

778
00:55:49,811 --> 00:55:53,144
- Have they been running?
- Yeah.

779
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:56,739
I started going by at 5:00,
and turning them on, 5:00 p.m.

780
00:55:57,485 --> 00:55:59,680
I got tired of the whole
unanswerable question...

781
00:55:59,788 --> 00:56:02,780
Are we doing this as an experiment
or are we doing this for me?

782
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:05,553
- A little of both.
- 5:00.

783
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,426
If we get this done by 3:00,
that's 10 hours in the box.

784
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:12,624
I've got the O2 tanks in the car.

785
00:56:28,283 --> 00:56:30,945
- Is that...
- Is that Rachel's car?

786
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,049
No, that's not Rachel's, that's her dad's.
They have the same kind.

787
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:37,622
Did you see that?

788
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,055
That's Mr. Granger. That's Thomas.
He's sitting in that car.

789
00:56:42,464 --> 00:56:43,488
What?

790
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,296
I swear that was him.
What the hell is he doing...

791
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:49,234
sitting outside my house
at 2:00 in the morning?

792
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:53,807
I don't believe this.
What, is he following us?

793
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:56,571
- What are you doing?
- Let's just see what he wants.

794
00:56:56,678 --> 00:56:59,613
No, let's just get out
of my neighborhood first. Come on.

795
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:02,148
- Did you see him today?
- No.

796
00:57:04,085 --> 00:57:06,485
I did. I saw him this afternoon...

797
00:57:07,055 --> 00:57:08,283
around 6:00.

798
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,654
Are you sure you didn't see him
when we drove past?

799
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:11,885
No, what?

800
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,486
I'm positive this afternoon
he was clean-shaven. I know he was.

801
00:57:15,597 --> 00:57:17,997
He was ready to go to some function
with his wife.

802
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,693
He looks like he's got
a two or three-day growth now.

803
00:57:20,802 --> 00:57:23,930
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm not sure, but I think so.

804
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:31,334
Rachel. This is Abe. Did I wake you up?

805
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:36,208
Can I get your dad's number
from you real quick?

806
00:57:36,818 --> 00:57:38,911
Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

807
00:57:41,256 --> 00:57:43,520
- Yeah, thanks.
- What's he doing?

808
00:57:44,426 --> 00:57:46,223
He's just sitting there.

809
00:57:46,594 --> 00:57:50,394
He got out for a second
and I thought he was coming over...

810
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:53,925
and then he got back in the car.
I think he's drunk.

811
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:56,629
Hi, sorry to call so late.

812
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,633
May I speak to Thomas Granger, please?

813
00:58:01,076 --> 00:58:04,239
Yeah, this is James Miller
from Putney and Myers.

814
00:58:05,847 --> 00:58:07,178
Hi, Mr. Granger?

815
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:10,040
Thomas Granger?

816
00:58:14,222 --> 00:58:16,690
What are you doing here? Come here!

817
00:58:31,906 --> 00:58:33,373
What happened?

818
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:36,339
I'm okay. I slipped.

819
00:58:47,222 --> 00:58:50,714
I want to know what box he used.
You built one for you, right? Just one.

820
00:58:50,825 --> 00:58:52,952
Yeah. How many do you think I made?

821
00:58:56,464 --> 00:58:59,331
These are set right.
I turned them on at 5:00.

822
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:02,368
He could have used one
and gone back to 5:00.

823
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,700
He could be in one of them right now.

824
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:10,739
I say we shut them off
and see if he's in there.

825
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,609
Were you planning on talking to him?

826
00:59:13,715 --> 00:59:15,910
Just tell me if you were.
I'm not going to be mad.

827
00:59:16,017 --> 00:59:17,848
No, I promise you. You know I wouldn't.

828
00:59:17,952 --> 00:59:19,180
Are you sure you wouldn't?

829
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:22,222
You're the one he can't get near
without passing out.

830
00:59:24,292 --> 00:59:27,056
There is no way
I would tell anyone about this. No way.

831
00:59:27,162 --> 00:59:29,289
- Can you think of any reason you might?
- No.

832
00:59:29,397 --> 00:59:32,230
Sometimes we do things
but don't know how we got to that point.

833
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,800
- No, I can't.
- Can't what?

834
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:36,735
I can't think of any reason why I would.

835
00:59:37,939 --> 00:59:39,702
Well, I can't either.

836
00:59:40,408 --> 00:59:42,501
What if it was an emergency?

837
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:47,940
- So you'd do it if it was an emergency?
- No, I don't know. What, so you might then?

838
00:59:48,616 --> 00:59:50,846
I don't know. What kind of emergency?

839
00:59:52,287 --> 00:59:54,187
The permutations were endless.

840
00:59:56,691 --> 00:59:58,386
They tried again going to the source...

841
00:59:58,493 --> 01:00:01,223
but even while keeping him separated
from Abe by two rooms...

842
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:02,318
Ask him his name.

843
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:05,160
...Granger's condition
could only be described as vegetative.

844
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:06,665
What did he say?

845
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:09,328
From this they deduced
that the problem was recursive...

846
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:13,066
but beyond that, found themselves
admitting, against their own nature...

847
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:15,665
and once again,
that the answer was unknowable.

848
01:00:15,777 --> 01:00:17,499
- What do you think he changed?
- Not much.

849
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:21,174
We didn't have any contact with him
in the 3 hours he could've done anything.

850
01:00:21,282 --> 01:00:25,275
I know he changed this. I know we weren't
having this conversation the first time...

851
01:00:25,386 --> 01:00:26,683
so you don't know what we lost.

852
01:00:26,788 --> 01:00:28,312
It really could not have been much.

853
01:00:28,423 --> 01:00:31,221
It doesn't matter how much.
It just matters that it's changed.

854
01:00:31,326 --> 01:00:32,554
I know what you're saying.

855
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,982
The question should have been...

856
01:00:34,062 --> 01:00:36,496
what to do with the comatose man
in the guest bedroom.

857
01:00:36,598 --> 01:00:40,295
But in Abe's mind
he was already compiling the list.

858
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:48,236
Two mg of oral triazolam...

859
01:00:48,343 --> 01:00:53,144
every seven hours induces a safe sleep state
and a minimal metabolic rate.

860
01:00:54,749 --> 01:00:56,376
At this continued state of rest...

861
01:00:56,484 --> 01:00:59,419
the human body breathes
0.3 liters of oxygen a minute...

862
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:02,046
or roughly 2,000 liters in four days.

863
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:06,090
A Class E oxygen tank holds 625 liters.

864
01:01:06,928 --> 01:01:08,293
To maintain hydration...

865
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:12,526
the body cycles through a minimum
of two-and-a-half liters of water per day.

866
01:01:12,867 --> 01:01:15,028
Any food would be a luxury...

867
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:17,898
but the small tank
of medical grade nitrous oxide...

868
01:01:18,006 --> 01:01:20,065
would be needed on the other side.

869
01:01:20,742 --> 01:01:23,973
Past the room that contained their machines
and up two levels...

870
01:01:24,078 --> 01:01:25,841
he made his way to another room...

871
01:01:25,947 --> 01:01:30,646
where he had stored what I will refer to
from here on as the Failsafe Machine.

872
01:03:11,753 --> 01:03:14,415
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

873
01:03:16,124 --> 01:03:17,182
Really?

874
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:19,820
Your cell and work.

875
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,392
I'm not there.

876
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:27,661
Really?

877
01:03:32,907 --> 01:03:34,499
I don't even know what.

878
01:03:37,312 --> 01:03:38,574
I'm just tired.

879
01:03:38,746 --> 01:03:42,978
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

880
01:03:56,064 --> 01:03:59,227
I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...

881
01:03:59,334 --> 01:04:02,201
friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.

882
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,770
But how about this instead?

883
01:04:03,871 --> 01:04:08,001
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

884
01:04:08,109 --> 01:04:10,873
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

885
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:13,572
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

886
01:04:15,149 --> 01:04:19,245
At this point
there would have been some discussion.

887
01:04:21,789 --> 01:04:24,815
Abe would, of course, want to know how.

888
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:30,227
Aaron would have to explain
all about the storage manifest...

889
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:33,789
and how it showed two rooms
under the name Abram Terger.

890
01:04:34,168 --> 01:04:37,296
Then Abe would need to know how.

891
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,901
Aaron would explain
that when he went up there...

892
01:04:41,008 --> 01:04:42,873
and found the Failsafe running...

893
01:04:42,977 --> 01:04:45,070
he knew exactly what it was.

894
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,544
But Abe would ask how.

895
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:52,251
And then the bit
about the modular design of the coffins...

896
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:56,119
and how it meant he could fold one up
and take it back inside another.

897
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:58,752
They are not one-time use only.

898
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,420
They are recyclable, Aaron would say.

899
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:08,930
How, Abe would ask.

900
01:05:12,206 --> 01:05:15,073
And Aaron would describe
how simple things become...

901
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:19,471
when you know precisely
what someone will have for breakfast...

902
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,810
even in a world of tamper-proof lids.

903
01:05:44,405 --> 01:05:45,394
How?

904
01:05:46,874 --> 01:05:49,308
And that's where
I would have entered the story.

905
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:51,878
Or exited, depending on your reference.

906
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:57,811
Because when Aaron came back
the second time, it wasn't so easy.

907
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:02,612
He wasn't expecting me to put up a fight.

908
01:06:02,723 --> 01:06:05,886
And by that time,
he was too exhausted to take me.

909
01:06:07,261 --> 01:06:10,094
But for reasons
that are only evident to me now...

910
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:12,765
I understood that he simply wanted it more.

911
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:16,325
That he just had more invested. So I left.

912
01:06:17,004 --> 01:06:20,235
He had already performed the task,
as I had intended to...

913
01:06:20,341 --> 01:06:23,777
of recording the conversations of the day
just in case.

914
01:06:23,978 --> 01:06:26,970
Through that earpiece
he had a three-second lead on the world.

915
01:06:27,081 --> 01:06:29,948
Aaron, you need some sleep.
Some real sleep.

916
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:33,247
I can't. I've got a schedule.

917
01:06:34,922 --> 01:06:38,449
He had but to speak aloud the words
that came into his head...

918
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,925
and those around him would fall in line.

919
01:07:01,549 --> 01:07:02,948
This is Track 3.

920
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:06,451
Abe is bringing my car around
and I am on my way to the court.

921
01:07:06,554 --> 01:07:07,714
I'll see Will there.

922
01:07:07,822 --> 01:07:11,883
I'll invite him to the party and make sure
he's bringing Rachel's boyfriend.

923
01:07:12,593 --> 01:07:13,651
Will.

924
01:07:15,096 --> 01:07:16,927
You pretentious prick.

925
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:19,295
What the hell is that?
Is that your cell phone?

926
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,994
- No, it's a radio, man.
- You look like Secret Service.

927
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:25,470
- You look like Secret Service.
- Ariel meeting is moved to Wednesday.

928
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:27,973
What? What the hell
am I hanging around here for?

929
01:07:28,075 --> 01:07:29,508
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

930
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:31,339
Nice shot, Aaron.

931
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:35,639
Brick. That is ugly, Aaron.

932
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,877
We could have used that
last week against TI.

933
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:41,216
At least you've got your golf game.
I see you've been practicing.

934
01:07:41,322 --> 01:07:45,019
You come out here with your $3 tie
and think you can play whiteball.

935
01:07:45,126 --> 01:07:47,060
What are you doing tonight?

936
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:50,289
I was supposed to be in Raleigh.
Thanks to you I missed my flight.

937
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:51,660
- You know Robert?
- Yeah.

938
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:54,257
He's got a birthday tonight.
Why don't you come out?

939
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:58,327
- I'm just going to hang out with my cousin.
- Bring him. Rachel will be there.

940
01:07:58,439 --> 01:08:00,566
- Big reunion.
- Exactly.

941
01:08:16,757 --> 01:08:18,918
I don't think I'm doing this.

942
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:21,920
Why not?

943
01:08:23,097 --> 01:08:26,430
Because I can think of a million
different ways that this can happen...

944
01:08:26,534 --> 01:08:28,434
and nobody comes anywhere near
getting hurt.

945
01:08:28,536 --> 01:08:31,437
I can call her and see
if she wants to do something else...

946
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:33,803
or better yet,
not even talk to her about the party.

947
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:36,968
That's good for tonight. What about
tomorrow? And every other day?

948
01:08:37,078 --> 01:08:40,047
- I'll take care of tomorrow, tomorrow.
- You'll watch her always.

949
01:08:40,147 --> 01:08:43,708
This guy is crazy enough to walk
into a room of people waving a shotgun.

950
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:46,286
What do you think he'll do
if he ever finds her alone?

951
01:08:46,387 --> 01:08:49,823
This way, we know exactly what happens.
We have complete control over it.

952
01:08:49,924 --> 01:08:53,121
At the end of the night,
this guy is arrested and goes to jail.

953
01:08:53,227 --> 01:08:55,957
That's the way it goes.
Your words, not mine.

954
01:08:56,597 --> 01:08:57,962
Now come on, it has to be you.

955
01:08:58,065 --> 01:09:01,501
She said she was there
because you told her you would be there.

956
01:09:07,074 --> 01:09:09,907
Don't tell me I came back
and did this for nothing.

957
01:09:14,281 --> 01:09:15,612
He doesn't fire?

958
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:18,779
- No. He didn't fire.
- He never fires?

959
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:21,218
- Not even when you rushed him?
- No. He didn't.

960
01:09:21,322 --> 01:09:24,086
He didn't the time I was, when I rushed him.

961
01:09:24,191 --> 01:09:26,785
And from what Robert tells you,
he didn't do it tonight.

962
01:09:26,894 --> 01:09:29,294
He doesn't have the nerve.
We know everything.

963
01:09:29,397 --> 01:09:30,955
Okay? We're prescient.

964
01:09:37,905 --> 01:09:39,395
We can still be careful.

965
01:09:39,507 --> 01:09:42,203
Maybe we can get to the gun
without him knowing.

966
01:09:42,576 --> 01:09:43,907
We definitely can.

967
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:47,538
He leaves it in the truck
before he goes in. We don't even need to...

968
01:09:47,648 --> 01:09:51,209
- but if it makes you feel better...
- What's wrong with our hands?

969
01:09:53,454 --> 01:09:54,853
What do you mean?

970
01:09:54,955 --> 01:09:57,219
Why can't we write like normal people?

971
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:02,221
I don't know. I can see the letters.

972
01:10:04,331 --> 01:10:06,352
I know what they should look like.

973
01:10:06,432 --> 01:10:09,657
I just can't get my hand
to make them easily.

974
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:13,064
Try comparing it to your left hand.
Mine looks the same.

975
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:35,091
Guess what today is.

976
01:10:37,565 --> 01:10:40,056
No, no. It's your friend Robert's birthday.

977
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:44,300
He says he likes records,
so I got him The Best of Bread.

978
01:10:44,405 --> 01:10:46,168
No, real records, like vinyl.

979
01:10:46,507 --> 01:10:50,773
I can tell you with certainty
what I did that night when it was my turn.

980
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:55,743
But I think it would do little good,
because what the world remembers...

981
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:00,147
the actuality, the last revision
is what counts, apparently.

982
01:11:00,755 --> 01:11:03,087
So how many times did it take Aaron...

983
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,784
as he cycled
through the same conversations...

984
01:11:05,893 --> 01:11:08,327
lip-synching trivia over and over?

985
01:11:08,796 --> 01:11:12,061
How many times would it take
before he got it right?

986
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:14,030
Three? Four?

987
01:11:15,202 --> 01:11:16,362
Twenty?

988
01:11:17,571 --> 01:11:20,836
I've decided to believe
that only one more would have done it.

989
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:23,933
I can almost sleep at night
if there is only one more.

990
01:11:24,812 --> 01:11:28,976
Slowly and methodically,
he reverse-engineered a perfect moment.

991
01:11:31,285 --> 01:11:33,776
He took from his surroundings
what was needed...

992
01:11:33,888 --> 01:11:36,083
and made of it something more.

993
01:11:48,636 --> 01:11:51,867
And once the details had been
successfully navigated...

994
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:55,237
there would be nothing left to do
but wait for the conflict.

995
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,778
Maybe the obligatory
last-minute moral debate...

996
01:12:02,883 --> 01:12:05,647
until the noise of the room
escalates into panic...

997
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:08,950
and background screams
as the gunman walks in.

998
01:12:10,357 --> 01:12:14,225
And eventually he must have got it perfect
and it must have been beautiful...

999
01:12:14,328 --> 01:12:17,024
with all the praise and adoration
he had coming.

1000
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:19,656
He had probably saved lives, after all.

1001
01:12:21,502 --> 01:12:24,733
Who knows what would have happened
if he hadn't been there?

1002
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,120
I know that things are bad, okay?

1003
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:46,791
I know that you don't agree
with what I've done.

1004
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:48,553
I know that you're upset.

1005
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:52,291
And to be honest, I'm not too happy
with you, either, right now.

1006
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,733
But you know that this is going to pass.
Let's just go.

1007
01:12:55,836 --> 01:12:58,771
Let's go somewhere
where we don't speak the language.

1008
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:00,898
Aaron, we don't have the money back here...

1009
01:13:01,008 --> 01:13:02,839
and we'd have to steal our own passports.

1010
01:13:02,943 --> 01:13:04,843
Money? We'll make money.

1011
01:13:05,112 --> 01:13:07,273
They have sports betting in Vegas.
March Madness.

1012
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:10,316
We'll make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations.

1013
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:13,477
Passports. You know
they're not using theirs, anyways.

1014
01:13:14,288 --> 01:13:16,381
Now, come on. I'm thinking Star City.

1015
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:18,924
Check out the cosmonaut training grounds.

1016
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:20,683
I'm staying here.

1017
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:22,687
Why?

1018
01:13:32,973 --> 01:13:35,407
They'll be building their own boxes
in another day.

1019
01:13:35,509 --> 01:13:37,739
And yours already knows what they've built.

1020
01:13:37,845 --> 01:13:41,008
You're not going to be able
to watch them forever.

1021
01:13:42,116 --> 01:13:44,243
The box Abe is building won't work.

1022
01:13:44,785 --> 01:13:46,514
He's got it wired wrong.

1023
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:48,745
And if they fix that...

1024
01:13:48,856 --> 01:13:51,825
I'll start actually taking pieces out of it.
It's just a gimmick.

1025
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:53,086
It doesn't work anymore.

1026
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:55,991
Your double will say
they have to move on to something else.

1027
01:13:56,163 --> 01:13:58,028
And mine will agree. They're friends.

1028
01:13:58,132 --> 01:13:59,929
You're staying? Why?

1029
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:02,125
Why? Let's see, why would Abe stay?

1030
01:14:02,236 --> 01:14:05,228
What possible reason could there be
to be here?

1031
01:14:07,741 --> 01:14:11,177
I guess that
it just won't go back far enough, will it?

1032
01:14:12,613 --> 01:14:16,242
Tell you what, why don't you take Kara
and Lauren and put them in the box...

1033
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:20,514
and then you and Aaron can each keep a set
and you can stop feeding off it.

1034
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:23,454
- Don't come back.
- You can each keep a set and a hemisphere.

1035
01:14:23,557 --> 01:14:26,492
There hasn't been a reason
to show you what I'm capable of...

1036
01:14:26,593 --> 01:14:28,925
but I'm telling this you now. Go out there.

1037
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:32,521
Do whatever the hell you want.
There's no way in the world I can stop you.

1038
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:34,328
But don't come back here...

1039
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:36,403
and don't come near them.

1040
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:38,664
Any of them.

1041
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:57,085
Now I have repaid any debt
I may have owed you.

1042
01:14:57,725 --> 01:14:59,420
You know all that I know.

1043
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:03,320
My voice is the only proof that
you will have of the truth of any of this.

1044
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:06,126
I might have written a letter
with my signature...

1045
01:15:06,233 --> 01:15:08,758
but my handwriting
is not what it used to be.

1046
01:15:11,271 --> 01:15:14,001
Maybe you've had the presence of mind
to record this.

1047
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:15,632
That's your prerogative.

1048
01:15:15,743 --> 01:15:17,734
You will not be contacted by me again.

1049
01:15:17,845 --> 01:15:19,039
Good morning.

1050
01:15:21,615 --> 01:15:22,912
Every half-meter.

1051
01:15:24,818 --> 01:15:26,115
Everywhere.

1052
01:15:28,022 --> 01:15:30,816
And if you look, you will not find me.
