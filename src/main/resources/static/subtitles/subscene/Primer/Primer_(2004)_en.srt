1
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,291
Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to read this...

2
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,697
and you're going to listen,
and you're going to stay on the line.

3
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,401
You're not going to interrupt.
You're not going to speak for any reason.

4
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,276
Now, some of this you know.
I'm going to start at the top of the page.

5
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:54,216
Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated.

6
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,289
They were these things.

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,914
Nothing extreme. Like anyone, they varied.

8
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:03,189
There were days of mistakes
and laziness and infighting.

9
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:07,565
And there were days, good days,
when by anyone's judgment...

10
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,267
they would have to be considered clever.

11
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,668
No one would say
that what they were doing was complicated.

12
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:18,343
It wouldn't even be considered new.
Except maybe in the geological sense.

13
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,408
They took from their surroundings
what was needed...

14
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,175
and made of it something more.

15
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,912
- We haven't even set up an appointment.
- What order date did you put on this?

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,183
- The 28th. Why?
- I don't know... Yeah, I'm putting 28th.

17
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,556
Have you thought any more
about what you want to put forward?

18
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,662
- Not really.
- Because I was...

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,461
I mean I haven't changed my mind
or anything.

20
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:45,504
Phillip and I were talking,
and we think it could be good. It'd be fun.

21
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,104
Nobody's saying it wouldn't be fun.

22
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,271
The time for jacking around with Tesla coils
and ball lightning in the garage is over.

23
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,975
Maybe you should try it on your own
in your free time.

24
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:00,143
My free time? The free time
after the 50 hours a week at work...

25
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:04,246
or after the 30 hours of free time
I already spend in that garage?

26
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,648
And it's not a Tesla coil.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,320
I could save a few minutes a day
by eating on the toilet.

28
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,125
How many patents do we have?
In the last 14 months?

29
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,133
- Did you sign the agreement?
- Nobody signed the agreement.

30
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,362
Doesn't matter,
we're sticking to the agreement.

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,598
Name one thing out of that garage
that's remotely profitable.

32
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,040
I don't see anybody quitting their jobs
because of it. Are you?

33
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,806
Abe just means that right now
the JTAG cards are it.

34
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:31,213
When you look at the addresses, we have
a lot of apartments. A lot of residences.

35
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,343
But these are not the bulk orders
to the OEMs or retail giants.

36
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,649
- These are the quiet basement...
- Hackers.

37
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,192
Yeah, hacker wannabes
testing their dads' old motherboards.

38
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:45,364
And I know that a lot of that is my fault,
admittedly, you know.

39
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,038
With everything last year,

40
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:49,889
and the doubletalk
we were getting from Platts...

41
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:53,632
- and all the stuff we won't get into now...
- We should get into it.

42
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,997
I'm sorry. What?

43
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,541
Go ahead. Tell him.

44
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,472
We should get into it.
I talked to my brother today.

45
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,143
He knows of two other cases like that
at his firm.

46
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,307
Let Platts know
that we're talking about it.

47
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,574
Look, forget Platts.

48
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,148
This has got to be about what
has the best chance of going to market...

49
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,389
and what is going to get us VC attention.

50
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,862
Look, I stuck by you guys
when it was your turn.

51
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,763
And I wasn't 100% sure
of what we were doing...

52
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,166
or even if I didn't agree, maybe.

53
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,532
But if it's my turn...

54
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,505
if we're still playing by the rules,
then this is what I want to try.

55
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,046
Here, take it.
They said it wouldn't hold a freeze.

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,277
Robert, please. It's not going to hold.

57
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,650
- It's going to go bad in my car.
- It'll go bad here. Okay, thanks.

58
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,450
- Good night, all.
- See you.

59
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,790
- We just got done giving this huge speech...
- We gave the speech?

60
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,922
We just got done. It was five minutes ago.

61
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:57,799
I'm the one that forced the issue. They're
onto us because I suck as the bad cop.

62
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,271
- You should do it. You could fake it better.
- I don't know about that.

63
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:04,741
As long as we're going down this road
where it's eighth grade physics...

64
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:08,302
and happy fun time out in that garage,
I think we could stand to try this.

65
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,440
Phillip and Robert are gung ho on theirs,
and that's fine.

66
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,849
But you know I have no interest in that.

67
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,285
I know you have no interest,
besides the fact...

68
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,223
that Phillip and Robert don't even need us.
They just want to use the equipment.

69
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,658
For what I want to do? We don't need them.

70
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,560
Not even Phillip,
because it doesn't need software.

71
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,132
- Is she asleep?
- No, and she needs a bath.

72
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,903
- She'll wind up in the closet if I do it.
- That's fine.

73
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,639
You know, even if Robert's okay with it,
and he won't be.

74
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:41,146
- I don't understand what that thing will do.
- We'll let them go at it for two months.

75
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,943
- They do theirs, we do ours.
- They said it'd take 14 hours.

76
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,143
Don't eat that. Seriously, it's bad.

77
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,720
We threw the first couple of batches out.
The filter.

78
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,516
What about crushed?

79
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,449
These guys are funded.

80
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,889
- These guys are... What?
- Liquid helium. These guys are funded.

81
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,623
That's what this is.

82
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,063
That's the whole difference.
That's what the box is.

83
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,295
We don't have to play the game
where we're going back and forth...

84
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,340
coming up with innovative ways to make it
colder and unusable in the process.

85
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,604
- Aaron, I need the hexagonal set.
- This is unmarketable.

86
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,407
By coming at it from the back end,
rather than changing...

87
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,677
the surrounding temperature,
we'll change the level it'll conduct...

88
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,617
the transition temperature.
And by bombarding these edges...

89
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,917
They're dropping the ceramic,
the temperature lower and lower.

90
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,823
It makes the ceramic less resistant
and knocks out the interior magnetic field.

91
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,657
What I'm saying is
we drop the box down on it.

92
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,564
Focus our own magnetic field to negate,
knock out with the inverse...

93
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,532
what's going on inside the ceramic.

94
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:40,663
That should change the transition
temperature to something we can work with.

95
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,209
- What are we saying that is?
- Hopefully, near room temperature.

96
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,174
What is that about?
The best mathematician is a lazy one?

97
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,011
- What did you ask for?
- I asked. I need the hexagonal set.

98
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,778
- What did you call it?
- Just come on.

99
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,648
- Are these Type One?
- The superconductors?

100
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,415
Yeah, they're Type One.

101
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,149
Is that going to be a problem?

102
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,125
There's plenty lying around at work,
but they're all bar coded.

103
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,822
- If I have to, I'll buy the kits.
- What are you doing about the source?

104
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,262
What?

105
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,901
- I can get them.
- You can... Are you sure?

106
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,800
I thought you didn't like this idea.

107
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,873
Buy them if you have to.
Everything else we can take care of.

108
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,339
What about the source here?

109
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,967
You know that story
about how NASA spent millions...

110
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,878
developing this pen that writes in zero-G?
Did you ever read that?

111
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,418
- And how Russia solved the problem?
- Yeah, they used a pencil.

112
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,619
Right, a normal wooden pencil.

113
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,617
It just seems like Phillip takes
the NASA route almost every time.

114
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,387
- Palladium?
- You've got their diagram, what does it say?

115
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,429
They use a ratio of platinum and palladium.

116
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,498
That's not necessary
with the changes I made.

117
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,863
They're just showing off.
If you have it, use it.

118
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,435
I want to get a replacement router.

119
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,630
- I'm putting down four ounces of palladium.
- Did Robert look at it?

120
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,502
- I already got his.
- I can't fix it.

121
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:52,271
- Okay. Where are you getting it?
- Wal-Mart. It's $50.

122
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,274
- Okay. Can you get a receipt, please?
- Yeah.

123
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,611
Wait, platinum or palladium
is less resistant?

124
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,776
- Abe? It's not a...
- Yeah, I don't care.

125
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,377
- So resistance doesn't matter.
- I need an aye or a yes.

126
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,513
- Did you jiggle the...
- The collet nut?

127
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,354
- Robert did it.
- Well, yes. I guess.

128
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,295
- Well, then, which is cheaper?
- You're not going to buy it, are you?

129
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,764
Well, unless you've got
a few grams of palladium lying around.

130
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:18,031
Why would they put it in there
if you didn't need it?

131
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,196
One catalytic converter. It's fine.

132
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,968
Remember to put it back.
Your emission just went up 300%.

133
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,976
- Is there enough in here?
- Yeah, should be.

134
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,946
If not, we'll pull the one out of my truck.
Okay, copper tubing.

135
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,721
- This will be out of commission, right?
- Without the tubing?

136
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,891
- We can use the Freon, too.
- No, it's going to be room temperature.

137
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,054
I know, just in case.

138
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:49,191
No, wait. Stop. I'll just buy the tubing.
This isn't saving us money.

139
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,168
- Jay? Hey, man. How are you?
- Good.

140
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,993
Should we be wearing goggles?

141
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,565
- Should we be wearing goggles?
- What?

142
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,936
Goggles. Should we be wearing goggles?

143
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,683
Wait. Phillip, you don't want
to come out here.

144
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,980
Phillip, grab a mask, okay?

145
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,296
It is, though, right? It's not just me?

146
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,780
No, it's definitely smaller,
but it just seems that way.

147
00:09:27,806 --> 00:09:29,452
Take what they have.

148
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,169
Minus the coolant which we don't need.

149
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,765
The rest of it is the mercury bath...

150
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:39,140
which you would know better than I do,
but they're probably just showing off.

151
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:44,044
I mean, you have it,
you got to use it, right?

152
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,351
- What? Does it hurt?
- No, I didn't feel anything.

153
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,751
That sound is just weirding me out.

154
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,453
- What does it feel like?
- I don't know.

155
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,724
I don't know if I'm making it up.

156
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,195
Here.

157
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,347
- Next part. Let's do the next part.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,693
Isn't there some sort of glass
or a transparent...

159
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,356
Anything we can use as a window? Pyrex?

160
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,093
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Okay, drop it.

161
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,261
I don't know of anything
that won't leave a gap in the field.

162
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,362
But we got to see what's going on in there.

163
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,135
- How much did that cost?
- Yeah.

164
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,772
- What?
- You want to put my camcorder...

165
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,406
inside the box that's so dangerous
we can't look into it.

166
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,719
If something happens,
would you pay me back?

167
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,616
So we have a slightly negative pressure
in the box.

168
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,759
So we're ready for the argon.

169
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,058
- Which one is that?
- It's the blue one.

170
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,935
I weighed it at 77 grams.

171
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,301
I set the scale to decagrams, though.

172
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,298
I'm showing 7.7 decagrams.

173
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,175
Ready for...

174
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:26,083
0.05 liters of argon.

175
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,162
- You ready?
- Just the plate first, right?

176
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,464
Right, first just the plate,
and then we'll...

177
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,602
Let's just give it a second.

178
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,951
- You want to do the box now?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,789
Let's go through the checklist.
Aaron, hold on a second.

180
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,593
Let's make sure everything's set up right.
Hold on, Aaron. Wait.

181
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,802
Just wait.

182
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,412
Okay.

183
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,291
Anything?

184
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,690
- Is this normal?
- I don't know.

185
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,024
- I'm turning it off.
- Wait! No.

186
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,871
- Okay, I didn't do that.
- Did we blow something?

187
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,970
Yeah, we did. That's destroyed.

188
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,308
- You want to check your camera?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,683
- Let's get this.
- You ready?

190
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,115
One, two, three.

191
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,894
Hey. Tell me you're hungry.
Kara's at her mom's and I'm starving.

192
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,430
Yeah, I'm hungry. What...

193
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,704
Abe, it's 7:00. Abe, it's 7:00 at night.

194
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,209
- Okay, yeah, I have food...
- Okay.

195
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,680
- Wait, are those kids there?
- Just a sec.

196
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,150
Yeah, they're here.

197
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:44,018
Okay, screw that, let's just go somewhere.
I just pulled in, so come on down.

198
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,183
Come up first. I have some stuff
I want to take back to the shop.

199
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,420
All right, but meet me at the door.

200
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,691
- Okay, all right.
- Seriously, meet me at the door.

201
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,732
Okay. All right. See you.

202
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,214
- What's up, Abe?
- Hey, Brad. How are you?

203
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,542
Good.

204
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,592
- How long did he say he would be there?
- Not long.

205
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,724
If he's got problems, he's got to fix them.
You're not his dad.

206
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,463
I know. I just thought it would be good
to do something charitable.

207
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,369
It definitely is charity.
At least you admit that.

208
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,408
You feel like a steak? To eat.

209
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,784
I don't want a steak. Let's just
grab some tacos on the way to the shop.

210
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,819
- I have some stuff I want to try out.
- Okay.

211
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,913
We can get some tacos on the way,
or we can get a steak afterwards.

212
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,289
What are you talking about?
I'm not paying for a steak.

213
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,623
It's stable?

214
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,302
Aaron, it's stable?

215
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,941
- What did you do to this thing?
- What?

216
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,910
- It looks like a dog digested it.
- Okay, that's the plate.

217
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,451
I rigged this into the box
so I could control the feed.

218
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,650
- I figured it's the easiest way...
- It's just controlling the box.

219
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,593
The plate stays the same.
What you do is you gradually feed it.

220
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,296
Okay. You hear that? How it's...

221
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,736
See, I'm not touching it anymore.
It's growing with its own momentum.

222
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,400
It's like a feedback loop,
and it just regulates itself.

223
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,275
And what you do is when it gets there,
you bring it back...

224
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,705
and there you go, it coasts.
It's stable. It stays like that.

225
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,919
So it works?

226
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,147
- Yeah, it does.
- What is that, like 10%?

227
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,621
It knocks another couple of points
by the time it reaches the peak.

228
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,754
You may want to come over here
and take a look at this.

229
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,523
Okay, what am I looking at?

230
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,932
- What are we pulling out of the batteries?
- Probably 24 volts.

231
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,402
- I mean, no more than that, right?
- Okay.

232
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,200
So your meter's jacked up.

233
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,074
That's what I figured.
So I tried three others.

234
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,499
I got the exact same thing.

235
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,409
- I spent all last night...
- What was it?

236
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:25,244
I spent last night and a two-hour break
just double-checking everything.

237
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,344
There's something wrong here. We're not
pulling out more than we're putting in.

238
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,685
- Slightly more.
- Well, yeah, whatever.

239
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,691
It's not like a volt and a half
more than we're putting in.

240
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,271
It's probably the batteries.

241
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:38,777
They're cheap batteries,
not regulated right.

242
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,556
That is weird, though.

243
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,962
You want to see something weirder?

244
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:50,140
Okay, let's go over this again.
Two batteries, right? 24 volts?

245
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,104
What are we pulling out of this one?
Just for fun.

246
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,305
Twelve volts.

247
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,821
- How about this one?
- Should be 12 volts.

248
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,597
So, what the hell is this thing?

249
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,777
It doesn't stay like that.

250
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,445
No, it winds down in a few minutes.
What does that?

251
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,446
I don't know. I'll tell them something.
I'll tell them we're spraying for bugs.

252
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,923
It should just be a day or two, anyways.

253
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:45,320
- Unless you want to bring them in.
- No, they have their work in there, too.

254
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,594
If Phillip finds out about that
he's going to have to take it apart.

255
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:53,104
- No. I'm just putting a little tweak on it.
- Yeah, I know. No, you're right.

256
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:57,142
Abe, it's my garage, okay?
It's not like they're paying rent.

257
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:01,739
There was value in the thing.
Clearly. Of that they were certain of.

258
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,179
But what is the application?
In a matter of hours...

259
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,775
they had pinned it to everything
from mass transit to satellite launching.

260
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,081
Imagining devices the size of jumbo jets.

261
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,249
Everything would be cheaper.
It was practical and they knew it.

262
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,418
But above all that, beyond the positives...

263
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,688
they knew that the easiest way
to be exploited...

264
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,060
is to sell something
they did not yet understand.

265
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,623
So they kept quiet.
The parties would continue.

266
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:26,296
Any birthday, anniversary, holiday...

267
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,341
maybe some obscure project launch.
It didn't matter. Any reason would do.

268
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,912
What was important is that Thomas Granger,
their last best hope of funding, show up.

269
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:39,383
If he left a little earlier than
they would've liked, he couldn't be blamed.

270
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,511
He was only there
to please his daughter Rachel.

271
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,181
And she was only there to please Abe.

272
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,685
What did you say
to Mr. Granger a while ago?

273
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,559
- Did you flip my burger?
- You can't call him Mr. Granger.

274
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,825
You have to call him, like,
Thomas or something.

275
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,834
- Go ahead.
- No, because he won't take you seriously.

276
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,632
- He thinks we're kids.
- If you call him Mr. Granger...

277
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,186
he looks at you like
you're a 6-year-old kid.

278
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:06,498
He does it with me.
It won't work anymore.

279
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,374
Abe had taken on the task
of quantifying and explaining the device.

280
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,215
But as weeks became months...

281
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,618
their enthusiasm became a slow realization
that they were out of their depth.

282
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,764
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

283
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,894
- Where'd you call?
- Your work and your cell.

284
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,139
I'm not there.

285
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,502
Really?

286
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,447
- March Madness?
- It's Carolina and Michigan.

287
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,674
- Who's up?
- I don't even know what.

288
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,311
Do you have anything important
at work today?

289
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,356
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

290
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,159
I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...

291
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,231
friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.

292
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,959
But how about this instead?

293
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,265
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

294
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,101
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

295
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,869
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

296
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,369
Well, it looks like mustard to me.

297
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,813
I know, but it's a film. It's a protein...

298
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,818
secreted by a fungus
called Aspergillus Ticor.

299
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,944
He told you that?

300
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,023
No, he knew it was a protein
but didn't know where it came from.

301
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,287
All he really did was just take
some pictures with their equipment.

302
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,725
Guess where we're going.

303
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,195
- Do you know where Will is?
- No, why?

304
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,630
The Ariel meeting
is pushed back till Wednesday.

305
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,498
I thought he was waiting around for it.
Where are you going?

306
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,833
What do they do with engineers
when they turn 40?

307
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,339
- What, Bradshaw?
- Exactly. You know what?

308
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,342
I do know where Will is.
I'll let him know on my way out.

309
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,674
- Okay. Thanks.
- Can you meet me out front?

310
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,874
- You got to drive.
- Okay, here. Take my keys.

311
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:29,181
Okay, if you can, just pretend
that this is the first time I came in.

312
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,813
And if you would just
tell him exactly what you told me...

313
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,026
- Okay, so what is it?
- Protein buildup.

314
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,758
- Okay, can you just tell him?
- Protein buildup.

315
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,030
- But what kind?
- Some fungus.

316
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,067
- Some fungus.
- Where did it come from?

317
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,818
I don't know.
You were to take it to the lab.

318
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:51,132
Yeah, that's next.

319
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,974
- You were in design, weren't you?
- Yeah.

320
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,904
How did you get over here?

321
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:59,211
Do you know what they do
with engineers when they turn 40?

322
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,145
They take them out and shoot them.

323
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,222
What the hell, Abe?
You could have just shown me the pictures.

324
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,986
- I want you to believe it.
- Believe what, the protein?

325
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,888
- I believe you.
- Okay, look...

326
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,431
this guy already thinks it's a joke,
so he may be a little defensive.

327
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,864
Really? Why would he think that?

328
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,013
Please.

329
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,849
Aspergillus Ticor.

330
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,580
This is a fungus that's everywhere.

331
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:41,522
It's in our bed, our skin,
sometimes even our GI tract. Everywhere.

332
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,930
It's basically the reason you don't leave
things in dark, damp, closed-off places.

333
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,863
Thank you.
Do you have that sample I brought?

334
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,132
There it is. Terger. T-E-R-G-E-R.

335
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,438
Okay, when I showed you this,
tell him what you thought.

336
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,314
- You thought it was a joke, right?
- It is a joke.

337
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,246
Right, but how did you know?

338
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,691
Will you show him? Please?

339
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,240
This is how I get protein A
out of Aspergillus Ticor. We sweeten it.

340
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,174
We agitate it. We spin it around.
We sweeten some more.

341
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,508
- Takes about a month.
- To get the same amount I brought in.

342
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,140
To get the same amount I brought in.

343
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,650
So if it's an incubator for fungus,
is that valuable?

344
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,549
- That's not what it is.
- Then what is it?

345
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:46,021
There's another way to secrete
that much protein. Do it naturally.

346
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,354
But that takes a lot longer.

347
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,094
If it has a little moisture
and it's left alone,

348
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,455
it'll start secreting
and it'll build up...

349
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,932
- and build up, but it takes a long time.
- How long?

350
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,901
- A long time.
- More than a few days? Then how long?

351
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,268
To get the same amount of protein
that we have...

352
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,671
the amount that I was wiping off
every five days...

353
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,970
and five days later it would accumulate...

354
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,740
he says it would take
about five to six years.

355
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,140
I don't want to belittle this guy.

356
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,947
So, I said screw it
and I put my watch in there.

357
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,615
- And?
- I want you to do it.

358
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,157
- Where is it? The box?
- I took it back to the shop.

359
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,756
- Wait, digital or old mechanical?
- Exactly. I did both.

360
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,501
- And what?
- I want you to do it.

361
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,436
We thought
that we were degrading gravity, right?

362
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,532
That we were blocking that information.

363
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,272
I think we're doing more than that.
I think we're blocking more than that.

364
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:46,511
When you were controlling the feed,
did you notice it was parabolic?

365
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,050
It's important. Parabolas are important.
Here, look at this.

366
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,556
I don't know, Abe.

367
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,285
I'm going to start it up
and let it run for 60 seconds...

368
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,658
with nothing in it.
It's empty this time.

369
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:58,752
That's 22...

370
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,594
In all the equations that describe motion
and heat and entropy.

371
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,227
In all Feynman diagrams what's the
one variable that you can turn negative...

372
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,805
and still get rational answers for?
It's not mass.

373
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,704
Twenty-two hours,
27 minutes in the box.

374
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:14,308
- It's odd, it's an odd number.
- That's 1,347 minutes.

375
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,341
- 1,347, man, you got that fast.
- How did you know it's odd?

376
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,512
Because this is it. This is what's going on.
There's an "A" end and a "B" end.

377
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,591
Let's say the A end is 12:00,
and the B end is 12:01.

378
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,592
All right? We start the machine
with the Weeble at the A end.

379
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,128
- It travels forward...
- You got to write this down.

380
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,664
- There's nothing to write down.
- I'll write it down.

381
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,825
It travels forward normally
towards the B end.

382
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,369
When it gets there,
the feed runs down parabolically...

383
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,599
until it should stop, but it curves
back around towards the A end.

384
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,870
When it gets back to the A end...
Curve that around. The Weeble...

385
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,310
has experienced a total of two minutes,
and again it curves...

386
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,541
- Back around. It curves parabolically.
- Right.

387
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,278
It comes back around
and it does this about 1,300 times.

388
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,115
When it finally exits on the B end...

389
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,054
it's traveled an odd number
of forward and backward trips.

390
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,593
What is so special about 1,300?
Why is it about 1,300? Why isn't it exact?

391
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,753
- This is not empirical.
- Here, give me that.

392
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:08,663
I don't know why it's not exact.
There's some sort of probability there.

393
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,292
Every time it hits the B end
there's a chance...

394
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,304
a small chance it won't
curve back around towards the A end.

395
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,103
And for some reason, it takes
about 1,300 trips before it finally does.

396
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,509
It does have to exit, or else
we wouldn't be able to see it afterwards.

397
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,604
Okay, let's take a look at this.

398
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,580
Twenty-two hours, 14 minutes.

399
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:33,785
- 1,334 minutes.
- Even.

400
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,890
Enter at the B end.

401
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,594
Exit at the B end.

402
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,004
- I just want you to see it the way I saw it.
- I am trying, okay?

403
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,574
Everything we're putting in that box
comes ungrounded.

404
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,439
And I don't mean grounded to the earth,
I mean not tethered.

405
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,708
We're blocking whatever keeps it
moving forward, so they flip-flop.

406
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,943
Inside the box, it's like a street,
and both ends are cul-de-sacs.

407
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:04,044
This isn't frame dragging or wormhole
matching. It's basic mechanics and heat.

408
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,248
This is not mechanics and heat.

409
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:14,123
- We can publish.
- Yeah, we can publish.

410
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,723
No, I mean we can really publish.

411
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,902
Aaron, the Weeble's stupid.
It can't move.

412
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,599
Even if we were
to put the Weeble in at point B...

413
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:27,406
it's still going to bounce back and forth
until it's kicked out at the B end.

414
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,574
But if it were smart...

415
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,617
it could enter at the B end
and exit at the A end before it flips back.

416
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,757
You're talking about making a bigger one.

417
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:51,399
I didn't say anything.
You're the one talking about it.

418
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,429
So, you believe me?

419
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,770
No, I don't.

420
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,309
Come on. Let's go get a drink or something.

421
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,817
- We're going to have to move it.
- We will.

422
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,690
We need a box big enough for a person
to fit into. As far as turning it on...

423
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,956
I was testing the box. It turns out
over half the rings are redundant.

424
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:20,520
The inner ring is strong enough on its own,
so it makes the plate smaller.

425
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,725
A lot more is unnecessary.
What we can do...

426
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:27,134
is take a lot of these small plates and
surround a container with a web of them.

427
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,668
How small?

428
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:33,969
It should be accumulative so a lot of
mini-fields equal one big one, right?

429
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,647
Yeah, sum of series, that makes sense.

430
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:40,184
What I was going to say is we need
to find a place where we can put it...

431
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,150
and turn it on and it won't be disturbed.

432
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,346
We could just lock it in a closet.

433
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,487
Someplace where someone's not going to
go poking around and messing with it.

434
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,254
And climate-controlled.

435
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,295
Yeah, so whatever, we'll find some place.

436
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,600
So, if we go your route with what?
A bunch of mini-fields?

437
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,432
That's a lot of work. We'd have to...
I mean, how many days is that?

438
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:05,070
Abe, you know what we could use?

439
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,513
I know we've seen
a lot of crazy things lately, okay?

440
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:13,550
I know you're still trying to put
it all together in a way that makes sense.

441
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:17,247
Look, I just want you to understand
that what's next is not a prank, okay?

442
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,119
I wouldn't do that to you
and I'm not doing that to you.

443
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:25,028
So when you see this, you can't yell
or make any noise or run anywhere, ok?

444
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,184
I know you probably feel like you're being
tricked or made fun of. But you're not, ok?

445
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,001
I promise you, you're not. Okay?

446
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,961
Who was that, Abe?

447
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,053
Let's just wait. Six minutes.

448
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,080
Look, you sure you're okay to drive?

449
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,353
What did you do all day?
The first time through?

450
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,329
I spent the day
in a hotel room in Russellfield.

451
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:47,400
- I'll just meet you back at the shop.
- I wonder what I did.

452
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,466
- I guess I went back to work.
- Yeah, probably.

453
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,511
Probably just worked, I guess.

454
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,578
Yeah, probably so.

455
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,411
Look, now that I know about this, Abe...

456
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,856
don't do this again, okay?
Not where it affects me.

457
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,021
Go ahead.

458
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,070
Hey, Rachel.

459
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,075
Why not the lottery?

460
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,180
We can if you want,
but it's not until Saturday.

461
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,814
And even if we win the full $10 million,
that's only $200,000 for the next 30 years.

462
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,658
- And that's just one good trade.
- A couple days like this.

463
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,162
- I was just running a test. In and out.
- I want to do what you did.

464
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,664
Exactly what you did.

465
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,667
- The first thing I did is call in sick.
- Okay, I did that.

466
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,637
- Then I drove to the storage facility.
- But I need to drop Lauren at school first.

467
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,334
Then meet me there.
We're going to need both cars.

468
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:34,536
We need to park yours down the road,
out of sight of the facility.

469
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,547
- Why are we doing that?
- Because we need a ride home.

470
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,207
- What is that...
- It'll make sense.

471
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,512
Okay, I'll be patient.

472
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,111
When I got to the storage room,
I flooded the box with argon...

473
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,954
and I had to tighten it up
to secure the leaks.

474
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,952
- There's leaks?
- There's always leaks.

475
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,396
At 8:30 a.m.,
I set the timer for 15 minutes...

476
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,906
I jumped in the car,
and drove to Russellfield.

477
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,268
Okay, I lost it.

478
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,038
- What?
- Why the timer?

479
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:12,281
Because the moment we start those
machines is the moment we'll end up...

480
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,113
- getting out of them, and-
- Right. Got it. Sorry.

481
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,915
I don't want to be standing around
when they do.

482
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:23,360
While I was on the road at 8:45,
the machine kicked on by itself...

483
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,523
and by 8:49, it was completely warmed up.

484
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,902
In Russellfield, I got a hotel room
and tried to isolate myself.

485
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,374
Wait, what do you mean "isolate"?

486
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,176
I closed the windows,
I unplugged everything in the room...

487
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,251
the telephone, TV, clock, radio, everything.

488
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,344
I didn't want to take the chance
of running into someone I knew...

489
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,423
or seeing something on the news
that might...

490
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:56,425
If we're dealing with causality,
and I don't even know for sure.

491
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,722
- I just...
- What?

492
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,293
- Took myself out of the equation.
- Err on the side of caution.

493
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,492
Yes.

494
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,130
Then what did you do all day?

495
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,871
- I just sat there. I had some books, but...
- What? Were you nervous?

496
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,106
Yeah.
It's mind-numbing, all the second-guessing.

497
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,486
"Evacipate."

498
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:32,153
At 3:30 p.m.,
I stopped by Williams Medical Supply.

499
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,356
Picked up a Class E oxygen tank and mask.

500
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:38,128
I called my mutual fund company and asked
which stock in their mid-cap fund...

501
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,136
had the greatest percentage gain that day.

502
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,207
The idea was just to get enough information
for one good trade.

503
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,003
Can we just download chart data
and trade on each movement?

504
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,547
But if we do that, I want to use the library
in Russellfield, use their computers.

505
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:08,759
So, I got to the storage room at about 3:15
and cut off the power to the box.

506
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,534
It cycled down to a tolerable level
at about 3:19.

507
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,763
The trick is to get in
after it reaches a comfortable level...

508
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:19,172
but before it shuts off completely.
There's a window there.

509
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,277
So, does it hurt?

510
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,408
Yeah, it does a little.

511
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:28,411
It's not bad if you wait for the right time.
It's like a small static shock.

512
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,079
- Once you're in, you're fine, though.
- What?

513
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:34,619
I know you've done it,
and I can only assume that you don't have...

514
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,693
cancer or male impotence.

515
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,490
But what is your opinion
on how safe this thing is?

516
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,963
I can imagine no way
in which this thing would be...

517
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,193
considered anywhere remotely close to safe.

518
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,794
All I know is I spent six hours in there
and I'm still alive.

519
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,308
You still want to do it?

520
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,991
I set the alarm on my stopwatch
for six hours.

521
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:16,192
I regulated the O2 tank,
took some Dramamine, and tried to sleep.

522
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,130
Did you?

523
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,302
- What?
- Did you sleep?

524
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,741
Not at first. I've never
considered myself claustrophobic...

525
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:28,972
but I started sweating and I couldn't find
the right flow rate on the tank...

526
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:33,508
and I was breathing differently than I was
when I was testing it on the outside.

527
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,018
Eventually, I settled down, and...

528
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,346
I don't know, maybe it was the Dramamine
kicking in, but I remember this moment...

529
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,256
in the dark
with the reverberation of the machine.

530
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,797
It was maybe the most content
I've ever been.

531
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,900
I woke up on my own without the alarm...

532
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,495
and waited for the machine to cool down.
Cool down from my perspective.

533
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,473
It got to a point where it sounded safe
to get out...

534
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,136
but the stopwatch still showed
a couple minutes...

535
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,611
so I trusted the math and waited.

536
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,481
That's not a static shock, Abe.
Okay, please stop it.

537
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,489
You got out too soon.

538
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,957
You have to wait for the stopwatch
so that you know the gain is low enough.

539
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,063
So, we're back here?

540
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,064
Yeah, we're here.
It's 8:50, Tuesday morning.

541
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,237
All right. Give me a few minutes.

542
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,843
From there it was easy.
The bulk of the work was done.

543
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,286
I just left everything the way I found it.
I left the machine alone...

544
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,359
and didn't turn it off,
and just cleared out of there.

545
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,897
So your double would find everything
the same later that day and get in the box?

546
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:31,526
Right, but also, I or my double or someone
was in the box coming backwards.

547
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:34,867
So who knows what that would've done
if I'd turned the machine off.

548
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,463
Definitely. So, they're one-time use only.

549
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:41,978
So then, at that moment, since my double
was on the way to the hotel in my car...

550
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,106
I had to take a taxi home. But when we go,
we'll be able to use your truck.

551
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,133
- You have a margin account, right?
- Yeah. I do now. What are we buying?

552
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,143
Good. Today, before 12:30,
we'll buy as many shares as we can of RGWU.

553
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,910
They'll say their earnings that quarter
are three and a half times consensus...

554
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,009
and the stock will nearly double
in afternoon trading.

555
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,049
- What do they do?
- What do you mean?

556
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,455
What does this company do?
Do they make things or...

557
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,154
I don't know.
All that matters is the price goes up.

558
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:36,962
The volume is so high that the number
of shares we trade won't affect the price.

559
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,831
You really don't know what they do?

560
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:51,211
That's why you spoke about a mid-cap fund,
so volume is high enough to hide us.

561
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,408
- Do you think it's too cautious?
- I don't know.

562
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,712
I know there's a lot of other stocks
out there...

563
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,017
that do a lot more than double,
but this is my first day.

564
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,491
- My God.
- She's not going to answer.

565
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,357
I know, Abe. That's the question.

566
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,492
I know, so what's the answer?
You've got the $400 billion...

567
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,198
you've gone the charity route,
you have this perfect 100-room mansion...

568
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,672
with matching his and her yachts
and helicopter pads.

569
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:54,745
Basically, you have absolute impunity
to do whatever you want...

570
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,834
nobody can touch you.

571
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,005
- You're back from a two-year...
- Above the law.

572
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:02,984
Absolutely, well above. You're fresh back
from this two-year world-galloping vacation.

573
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,146
How do you fill your day? What do you do?

574
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:08,431
Abe, I know that's the question,
but it's not a real question,

575
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:09,715
so why does it matter?

576
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,192
So what's the answer?

577
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,229
Babe, he knows that's the question, okay?
He's asking you the question.

578
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:18,994
What do you mean? What would I do
with my life or what would I do tomorrow?

579
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,365
My God, either.

580
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:26,065
I'd have to do something constructive.
I'd have to do something that would help...

581
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:29,840
- something that would make me feel good.
- I know. That's fantastic. Good.

582
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:34,816
- My wife. So good. So pure. You are pure.
- Shut up. Why did you ask, then?

583
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:39,250
This is what I would do:
I would wake up tomorrow morning...

584
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,790
and I'd go over to Gabriel Capital Inc...

585
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,658
and I would tell Joseph Platts' receptionist
that I'm there to see him...

586
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,458
and when he comes out...

587
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,799
I would ram my fist
through the flat of his nose.

588
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,763
Just one good punch, one good pow.

589
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,506
- That's amazing. It's about time.
- That is so great.

590
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,308
Where did this come from?
You're always defending the guy.

591
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,975
- It's unnatural.
- I'd only do it if I knew that...

592
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,813
no one would find out or get hurt.

593
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,286
Like, I wish that there was a way
that I could do it...

594
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,220
and then I go back and tell myself not to.

595
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,419
Because I just want to know
what it feels like. That's all, really.

596
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,722
I'm so proud.

597
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,623
Finally, my husband, the hero.

598
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:32,070
- We can't do that.
- I know.

599
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,138
Did you call pest control?

600
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:38,779
Babe, they're birds. You don't want a bunch
of dead baby birds up there, do you?

601
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:42,910
- They don't sound like birds.
- She thinks there are rats in the attic.

602
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,912
But the idea had been spoken...

603
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,151
and the words wouldn't go back
after they had been uttered aloud.

604
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,852
So you are understanding this, right?

605
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,486
You don't have to sell me
on not doing this, okay?

606
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,623
- I don't think I told you...
- Even if you do stop yourself...

607
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:00,295
your double, from hitting Platts,
why would he, your double, get in the box?

608
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,862
And with no need for it,
no possible real-world application...

609
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,632
no advantage at all to be gained from it,
the idea stayed.

610
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:11,737
- How would you do it?
- I wouldn't.

611
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,673
- Just for fun.
- I still wouldn't.

612
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,618
- But what if there was a way to...
- Look, Abe, look.

613
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:21,216
I'm not going to pretend
like I know anything about paradoxes...

614
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,726
or what follows them, and honestly,
I really don't believe in that crap.

615
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,628
Kill your mom before you were born,
whatever. It has to work itself out somehow.

616
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,859
- I don't know.
- This is what I know for sure.

617
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:35,029
The worst thing in the world is to know
that the moment you are experiencing...

618
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,937
has already been defined,
that this is the second...

619
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,944
or third time through, or whatever.
And do you ever feel like...

620
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,779
I don't know, maybe things aren't right,
like maybe your life is in disarray...

621
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:51,048
or just not what you would like
and you start to wonder what caused this.

622
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,383
People are always blaming their parents...

623
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,790
as if, if their mom had breastfed them,
their lives would be different.

624
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,055
Bunch of whiners.

625
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:02,326
Yeah, they are. But what if it wasn't
something you wonder about?

626
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:05,425
What if you knew this is not the way
things are supposed to be?

627
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:09,666
I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole
"destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing.

628
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,673
I'm not, either. But what's worse?

629
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,869
Thinking you're being paranoid
or knowing you should be?

630
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,548
You don't have to look at me like that.
I'm okay.

631
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,525
No, I just assumed that you would.
I trust her.

632
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:36,430
- I know that when I decided to tell you...
- Decided to tell?

633
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,829
I knew that you are married
and that there's no secrets.

634
00:45:39,855 --> 00:45:41,660
Anything I tell you, she'll know.

635
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,291
- It's not a matter of trust.
- I know.

636
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:46,002
It's just how much better will it be
if in a few days...

637
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,568
I surprise her and we all just fly
to Costa Rica or somewhere for a month?

638
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,207
We'll let her understand it gradually.
Maybe do some real estate shopping...

639
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:56,218
For now, you can tell her
you had a good day in the market.

640
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,478
- You don't understand.
- No.

641
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,968
You don't understand the questions
that come with that.

642
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,582
But we'll explain it to her,
and we'll take some time...

643
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:03,887
to figure out what's next...

644
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,555
which, I think, should be building
a bigger box, like the size of a room...

645
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:09,496
where more than one person could fit in.

646
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,728
Safe or not,
the thing feels like a coffin the way it is.

647
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,233
By the way, this is our guy.

648
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,106
- What's the volume?
- Five-and-a-half.

649
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,339
What's the return? Holy...

650
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:30,449
No, I can't beat that. But mainly, I guess
I was just talking about Robert and Phillip.

651
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:31,748
I don't want to tell them.

652
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,119
I know they have a lot invested
in the group...

653
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,589
I don't want to tell them.

654
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,924
If you need me to take
the guilt on this one, fine, okay?

655
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,792
I accept it gladly. It's mine.

656
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,560
At the end of this week,
they can have whatever they want.

657
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,932
I'll turn over patent rights on everything
from the last two years.

658
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,403
They can have the equipment,
the garage, the house.

659
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,373
They can have my truck
if that makes you feel better.

660
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,570
But I am not telling them a thing
about this. We're not.

661
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,590
God, everything is so different in there.

662
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,755
You can feel how cut off you are.

663
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,068
It's this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it.

664
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,626
And the sound.
Isn't the sound different on the inside?

665
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:25,138
It's like it's singing.
I guess you can't hear it on the outside...

666
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,769
- I had this dream in there.
- About what?

667
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:35,311
I was on or near the ocean,
and I just kept hearing the surf.

668
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,309
It was so uneventful.

669
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:41,091
At night.
And the tide kept coming in and out.

670
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,635
Come here for a second, man.
What's on your hand?

671
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,004
- Are you bleeding?
- That is blood.

672
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,667
- Turn around.
- You see it?

673
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:03,178
Where is it coming from? It's your notebook.

674
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,374
- It's you. My gosh, it's on your ear.
- What is this?

675
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,016
- Your ear's bleeding. Man.
- Give me that. I got it.

676
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,559
- Is that normal? This isn't normal.
- For the machine?

677
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,727
For people.
You think it's the machine? I got it.

678
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,841
Great. I can actually
get some work done today.

679
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,316
Hi, guys, what's going on?

680
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,252
I always seem to get a lot more done
when I'm not locked out.

681
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,788
He says they had to spray again.

682
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,859
But he can't tell us about it in advance.
Is Hero even here?

683
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,292
You never see anything around here
but those geckos.

684
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,023
- I know.
- I think it's for the geckos.

685
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,496
- What?
- Why?

686
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:58,897
- Hey, man, thanks for the present.
- How is that working out for you?

687
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,733
You know what? You guys, both of you,
you make fun, but there is a difference.

688
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,102
Wait. What did you call him?

689
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:06,267
- What?
- When you walked in? What did you say?

690
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,843
- He didn't tell you about it?
- No.

691
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:12,075
All right. Rachel's ex-boyfriend
walks into my birthday party with a shotgun.

692
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,615
- What?
- Swear to God.

693
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,514
I've already gotten that speech from Kara.

694
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,985
- Filby!
- You'll get it. You have a wife and kid.

695
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:21,387
It's funny how you two are the only people
that have a problem with it.

696
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,959
- Everybody else thinks I did a good thing.
- You didn't.

697
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:27,462
You can't risk your life and
especially the welfare of Kara and Lauren...

698
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,588
for someone like Rachel.

699
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,758
She practically begs
for this to happen to her.

700
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,460
I figured at least you'd understand.

701
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,537
Understand what?
You've never been like this.

702
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,335
That's what I mean.
You see how different things are now.

703
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,170
Different? How are things different?

704
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,779
You see it, okay? I know you do.

705
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,180
Look, that was the night...

706
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,878
you had told me everything
about the machine.

707
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,686
Everything you showed me was so fresh
in my head and when I saw this guy...

708
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,352
I'm looking at him.
I wasn't going to let him do that.

709
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,226
I wasn't going
to let him scare people like that.

710
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,565
I know it was stupid, okay?

711
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:07,203
But I mean, this whole idea,
this whole thing that we're doing.

712
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:12,333
It just took some getting used to for me.
I wasn't completely acclimated to it.

713
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:15,968
If it was just you, you had to worry about,
I'd still think you're stupid.

714
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,946
But you have a family now,
and God, especially now...

715
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,880
anything like this would be crazy.

716
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,976
- I know, okay.
- I know you know that, but you've got to...

717
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,113
- I know, okay?
- Filby!

718
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:33,251
You little sack of...
Even if you see him, don't tell me.

719
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,992
It's not my fault if I don't know,
and I just hope the thing runs away.

720
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,829
Then what are we doing out here?

721
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:42,770
She worries about the cat.
So you look for the cat. It's what you do.

722
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,683
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

723
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:58,084
It's embarrassing that the storage room guy
sees us come in together...

724
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,382
but he never sees us leave.

725
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,957
Yeah, but what do you think
the receptionist thinks...

726
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,551
about two guys that come
and get a room for six hours every day?

727
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,466
Did you unplug this?

728
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,465
You brought your cell phone?

729
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,966
Can I check the caller ID?

730
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,775
Yeah, we're not back.

731
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,782
Yeah, but you can't take it back
with you, okay?

732
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,721
This is Aaron. Hey, babe.

733
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,824
I'm not there. I had to come downtown
and hold some of these guys' hands.

734
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,124
Tell me.

735
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,180
That sounds good.

736
00:51:43,206 --> 00:51:45,689
No, I've got to
eat with these offsite fags.

737
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,167
Save mine, though. I'll have it later.

738
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:52,998
Okay. Yeah, 6:00.

739
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,773
- What?
- What?

740
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,808
We're supposed to win this by two,
they just turned over with 12 on the clock.

741
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:05,780
- We have to foul.
- No.

742
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,846
What? No, we foul here,
they miss the first free throw...

743
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,114
- and they come back with the three.
- Three points.

744
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,416
That's right.

745
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:23,027
Man, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.

746
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,069
What's up, you guys?

747
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:39,012
- You have got to be kidding.
- I'm sorry. I forgot it was in my pocket.

748
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:40,777
- It's Kara?
- Yeah.

749
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,812
How do cell phones work?

750
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,789
If there's two duplicate phones
and I call the same number...

751
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,156
do they both ring at the same time,
or is there...

752
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,422
- That's not how they work.
- It's a radio signal.

753
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,792
No, it's a network.

754
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,958
It checks each area and
when it finds the phone, it stops ringing.

755
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,660
It rings the first one.

756
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,869
- This one is ringing.
- Right.

757
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,273
So the one your double has in Russellfield
can't be.

758
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,436
Right. I think we broke symmetry.

759
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:14,012
- Are you sure that's how cell phones work?
- No.

760
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,414
You feel all right?

761
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,382
- I feel fine. Do you?
- Yeah.

762
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,714
Is Kara asleep? Did I wake you up?

763
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:55,757
Yeah. No, not me, it felt more like a nap.

764
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,692
I think my body's getting used to
these 36-hour days. What's going on?

765
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,060
We can do this, but we have to do it now.

766
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,929
- Do you have his home address?
- Why now?

767
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,232
We were planning on taking a trip
tomorrow, right? Just like today?

768
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,566
Yeah, for stocks.

769
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:14,110
Okay, well, half an hour ago I was asleep.
This car alarm woke me up.

770
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,975
These kids were down skating by,
hitting cars on the block.

771
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,039
So we go right now, do our business
at Platts', get back in the box...

772
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,676
and come back before
those kids set off those alarms.

773
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:27,746
All we really have to do is stand there
in plain sight. That should scare them off.

774
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,825
That way my double
sleeps through the night...

775
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:34,386
they don't have this conversation,
and they get in the box tomorrow as usual.

776
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,765
- They'll be changed. But...
- Yeah, but at least they'll get in the box.

777
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:45,838
Wait, how do we go back that far
if the machines haven't been running?

778
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:51,544
- Have they been running?
- Yeah.

779
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:55,139
I started going by at 5:00,
and turning them on, 5:00 p.m.

780
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,080
I got tired of the whole
unanswerable question...

781
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,180
Are we doing this as an experiment
or are we doing this for me?

782
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,953
- A little of both.
- 5:00.

783
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,826
If we get this done by 3:00,
that's 10 hours in the box.

784
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:11,024
I've got the O2 tanks in the car.

785
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:29,345
- Is that...
- Is that Rachel's car?

786
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,449
No, that's not Rachel's, that's her dad's.
They have the same kind.

787
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,022
Did you see that?

788
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,455
That's Mr. Granger. That's Thomas.
He's sitting in that car.

789
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:41,888
What?

790
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,696
I swear that was him.
What the hell is he doing...

791
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,634
sitting outside my house
at 2:00 in the morning?

792
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,207
I don't believe this.
What, is he following us?

793
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:54,971
- What are you doing?
- Let's just see what he wants.

794
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,013
No, let's just get out
of my neighborhood first. Come on.

795
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,548
- Did you see him today?
- No.

796
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:04,885
I did. I saw him this afternoon...

797
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,683
around 6:00.

798
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,054
Are you sure you didn't see him
when we drove past?

799
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,285
No, what?

800
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,886
I'm positive this afternoon
he was clean-shaven. I know he was.

801
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,397
He was ready to go to some function
with his wife.

802
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,093
He looks like he's got
a two or three-day growth now.

803
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,330
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm not sure, but I think so.

804
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,734
Rachel. This is Abe. Did I wake you up?

805
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:34,608
Can I get your dad's number
from you real quick?

806
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:37,311
Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

807
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,920
- Yeah, thanks.
- What's he doing?

808
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,623
He's just sitting there.

809
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:48,794
He got out for a second
and I thought he was coming over...

810
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,325
and then he got back in the car.
I think he's drunk.

811
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:55,029
Hi, sorry to call so late.

812
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:58,033
May I speak to Thomas Granger, please?

813
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,639
Yeah, this is James Miller
from Putney and Myers.

814
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,578
Hi, Mr. Granger?

815
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,440
Thomas Granger?

816
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,090
What are you doing here? Come here!

817
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:31,773
What happened?

818
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,739
I'm okay. I slipped.

819
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:49,114
I want to know what box he used.
You built one for you, right? Just one.

820
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,352
Yeah. How many do you think I made?

821
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,731
These are set right.
I turned them on at 5:00.

822
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,768
He could have used one
and gone back to 5:00.

823
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,100
He could be in one of them right now.

824
00:59:06,443 --> 00:59:09,139
I say we shut them off
and see if he's in there.

825
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,009
Were you planning on talking to him?

826
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,310
Just tell me if you were.
I'm not going to be mad.

827
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,248
No, I promise you. You know I wouldn't.

828
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,580
Are you sure you wouldn't?

829
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,622
You're the one he can't get near
without passing out.

830
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,456
There is no way
I would tell anyone about this. No way.

831
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,689
- Can you think of any reason you might?
- No.

832
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,630
Sometimes we do things
but don't know how we got to that point.

833
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,200
- No, I can't.
- Can't what?

834
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:35,135
I can't think of any reason why I would.

835
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,102
Well, I can't either.

836
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,901
What if it was an emergency?

837
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:46,340
- So you'd do it if it was an emergency?
- No, I don't know. What, so you might then?

838
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,246
I don't know. What kind of emergency?

839
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,587
The permutations were endless.

840
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,786
They tried again going to the source...

841
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,623
but even while keeping him separated
from Abe by two rooms...

842
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:00,718
Ask him his name.

843
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,560
...Granger's condition
could only be described as vegetative.

844
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,065
What did he say?

845
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,728
From this they deduced
that the problem was recursive...

846
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:11,466
but beyond that, found themselves
admitting, against their own nature...

847
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,065
and once again,
that the answer was unknowable.

848
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,892
- What do you think he changed?
- Not much.

849
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:19,574
We didn't have any contact with him
in the 3 hours he could've done anything.

850
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:23,675
I know he changed this. I know we weren't
having this conversation the first time...

851
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,083
so you don't know what we lost.

852
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:26,712
It really could not have been much.

853
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,621
It doesn't matter how much.
It just matters that it's changed.

854
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:30,954
I know what you're saying.

855
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,367
The question should have been...

856
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,896
what to do with the comatose man
in the guest bedroom.

857
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:38,695
But in Abe's mind
he was already compiling the list.

858
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,636
Two mg of oral triazolam...

859
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:51,544
every seven hours induces a safe sleep state
and a minimal metabolic rate.

860
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,776
At this continued state of rest...

861
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:57,819
the human body breathes
0.3 liters of oxygen a minute...

862
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:00,446
or roughly 2,000 liters in four days.

863
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:04,490
A Class E oxygen tank holds 625 liters.

864
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,693
To maintain hydration...

865
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:10,926
the body cycles through a minimum
of two-and-a-half liters of water per day.

866
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,428
Any food would be a luxury...

867
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,298
but the small tank
of medical grade nitrous oxide...

868
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:18,465
would be needed on the other side.

869
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:22,373
Past the room that contained their machines
and up two levels...

870
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:24,241
he made his way to another room...

871
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:29,046
where he had stored what I will refer to
from here on as the Failsafe Machine.

872
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:12,815
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

873
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:15,582
Really?

874
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,220
Your cell and work.

875
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,792
I'm not there.

876
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,061
Really?

877
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,899
I don't even know what.

878
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:36,974
I'm just tired.

879
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:41,378
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

880
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:57,627
I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...

881
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:00,601
friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.

882
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,170
But how about this instead?

883
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:06,401
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

884
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,273
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

885
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:11,972
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

886
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:17,645
At this point
there would have been some discussion.

887
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:23,215
Abe would, of course, want to know how.

888
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,627
Aaron would have to explain
all about the storage manifest...

889
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:32,189
and how it showed two rooms
under the name Abram Terger.

890
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,696
Then Abe would need to know how.

891
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:39,301
Aaron would explain
that when he went up there...

892
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,273
and found the Failsafe running...

893
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,470
he knew exactly what it was.

894
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,944
But Abe would ask how.

895
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,651
And then the bit
about the modular design of the coffins...

896
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:54,519
and how it meant he could fold one up
and take it back inside another.

897
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,152
They are not one-time use only.

898
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,820
They are recyclable, Aaron would say.

899
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,330
How, Abe would ask.

900
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:13,473
And Aaron would describe
how simple things become...

901
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,871
when you know precisely
what someone will have for breakfast...

902
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,210
even in a world of tamper-proof lids.

903
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:43,794
How?

904
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,708
And that's where
I would have entered the story.

905
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:50,278
Or exited, depending on your reference.

906
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,211
Because when Aaron came back
the second time, it wasn't so easy.

907
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,012
He wasn't expecting me to put up a fight.

908
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,286
And by that time,
he was too exhausted to take me.

909
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,494
But for reasons
that are only evident to me now...

910
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,165
I understood that he simply wanted it more.

911
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:14,725
That he just had more invested. So I left.

912
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,635
He had already performed the task,
as I had intended to...

913
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:22,177
of recording the conversations of the day
just in case.

914
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,370
Through that earpiece
he had a three-second lead on the world.

915
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,348
Aaron, you need some sleep.
Some real sleep.

916
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,647
I can't. I've got a schedule.

917
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,849
He had but to speak aloud the words
that came into his head...

918
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:39,325
and those around him would fall in line.

919
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,348
This is Track 3.

920
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,851
Abe is bringing my car around
and I am on my way to the court.

921
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,114
I'll see Will there.

922
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:10,283
I'll invite him to the party and make sure
he's bringing Rachel's boyfriend.

923
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,051
Will.

924
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,327
You pretentious prick.

925
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,695
What the hell is that?
Is that your cell phone?

926
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,394
- No, it's a radio, man.
- You look like Secret Service.

927
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:23,870
- You look like Secret Service.
- Ariel meeting is moved to Wednesday.

928
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,373
What? What the hell
am I hanging around here for?

929
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:27,908
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

930
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,739
Nice shot, Aaron.

931
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,039
Brick. That is ugly, Aaron.

932
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,277
We could have used that
last week against TI.

933
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,616
At least you've got your golf game.
I see you've been practicing.

934
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,419
You come out here with your $3 tie
and think you can play whiteball.

935
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,460
What are you doing tonight?

936
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,689
I was supposed to be in Raleigh.
Thanks to you I missed my flight.

937
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,060
- You know Robert?
- Yeah.

938
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,657
He's got a birthday tonight.
Why don't you come out?

939
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:56,727
- I'm just going to hang out with my cousin.
- Bring him. Rachel will be there.

940
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,966
- Big reunion.
- Exactly.

941
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:17,318
I don't think I'm doing this.

942
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,320
Why not?

943
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:24,830
Because I can think of a million
different ways that this can happen...

944
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,834
and nobody comes anywhere near
getting hurt.

945
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,837
I can call her and see
if she wants to do something else...

946
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,203
or better yet,
not even talk to her about the party.

947
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:35,368
That's good for tonight. What about
tomorrow? And every other day?

948
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:38,447
- I'll take care of tomorrow, tomorrow.
- You'll watch her always.

949
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:42,108
This guy is crazy enough to walk
into a room of people waving a shotgun.

950
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,686
What do you think he'll do
if he ever finds her alone?

951
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,223
This way, we know exactly what happens.
We have complete control over it.

952
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:51,521
At the end of the night,
this guy is arrested and goes to jail.

953
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,357
That's the way it goes.
Your words, not mine.

954
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:56,362
Now come on, it has to be you.

955
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,901
She said she was there
because you told her you would be there.

956
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,307
Don't tell me I came back
and did this for nothing.

957
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,012
He doesn't fire?

958
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,179
- No. He didn't fire.
- He never fires?

959
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:19,618
- Not even when you rushed him?
- No. He didn't.

960
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:22,486
He didn't the time I was, when I rushed him.

961
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:25,185
And from what Robert tells you,
he didn't do it tonight.

962
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,694
He doesn't have the nerve.
We know everything.

963
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,355
Okay? We're prescient.

964
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,795
We can still be careful.

965
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:40,603
Maybe we can get to the gun
without him knowing.

966
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,307
We definitely can.

967
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,938
He leaves it in the truck
before he goes in. We don't even need to...

968
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:49,609
- but if it makes you feel better...
- What's wrong with our hands?

969
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,253
What do you mean?

970
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,619
Why can't we write like normal people?

971
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,621
I don't know. I can see the letters.

972
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,806
I know what they should look like.

973
01:10:04,832 --> 01:10:08,057
I just can't get my hand
to make them easily.

974
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,464
Try comparing it to your left hand.
Mine looks the same.

975
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,491
Guess what today is.

976
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:38,456
No, no. It's your friend Robert's birthday.

977
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,700
He says he likes records,
so I got him The Best of Bread.

978
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,568
No, real records, like vinyl.

979
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:49,173
I can tell you with certainty
what I did that night when it was my turn.

980
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:54,143
But I think it would do little good,
because what the world remembers...

981
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:58,547
the actuality, the last revision
is what counts, apparently.

982
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:01,487
So how many times did it take Aaron...

983
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,184
as he cycled
through the same conversations...

984
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,727
lip-synching trivia over and over?

985
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:10,461
How many times would it take
before he got it right?

986
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,430
Three? Four?

987
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,762
Twenty?

988
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:19,236
I've decided to believe
that only one more would have done it.

989
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:22,333
I can almost sleep at night
if there is only one more.

990
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:27,376
Slowly and methodically,
he reverse-engineered a perfect moment.

991
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:32,176
He took from his surroundings
what was needed...

992
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,483
and made of it something more.

993
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:50,267
And once the details had been
successfully navigated...

994
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:53,637
there would be nothing left to do
but wait for the conflict.

995
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,178
Maybe the obligatory
last-minute moral debate...

996
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:04,047
until the noise of the room
escalates into panic...

997
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,350
and background screams
as the gunman walks in.

998
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:12,625
And eventually he must have got it perfect
and it must have been beautiful...

999
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,424
with all the praise and adoration
he had coming.

1000
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:18,056
He had probably saved lives, after all.

1001
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:23,133
Who knows what would have happened
if he hadn't been there?

1002
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,520
I know that things are bad, okay?

1003
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:45,191
I know that you don't agree
with what I've done.

1004
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:46,953
I know that you're upset.

1005
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:50,691
And to be honest, I'm not too happy
with you, either, right now.

1006
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,133
But you know that this is going to pass.
Let's just go.

1007
01:12:54,236 --> 01:12:57,171
Let's go somewhere
where we don't speak the language.

1008
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:59,298
Aaron, we don't have the money back here...

1009
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,239
and we'd have to steal our own passports.

1010
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,243
Money? We'll make money.

1011
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:05,673
They have sports betting in Vegas.
March Madness.

1012
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,716
We'll make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations.

1013
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:11,877
Passports. You know
they're not using theirs, anyways.

1014
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,781
Now, come on. I'm thinking Star City.

1015
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,324
Check out the cosmonaut training grounds.

1016
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,083
I'm staying here.

1017
01:13:20,029 --> 01:13:21,087
Why?

1018
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,807
They'll be building their own boxes
in another day.

1019
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,139
And yours already knows what they've built.

1020
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,408
You're not going to be able
to watch them forever.

1021
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,643
The box Abe is building won't work.

1022
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:44,914
He's got it wired wrong.

1023
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,145
And if they fix that...

1024
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,225
I'll start actually taking pieces out of it.
It's just a gimmick.

1025
01:13:50,326 --> 01:13:51,486
It doesn't work anymore.

1026
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,391
Your double will say
they have to move on to something else.

1027
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:56,428
And mine will agree. They're friends.

1028
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,329
You're staying? Why?

1029
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,525
Why? Let's see, why would Abe stay?

1030
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,628
What possible reason could there be
to be here?

1031
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,577
I guess that
it just won't go back far enough, will it?

1032
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:14,642
Tell you what, why don't you take Kara
and Lauren and put them in the box...

1033
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:18,914
and then you and Aaron can each keep a set
and you can stop feeding off it.

1034
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,854
- Don't come back.
- You can each keep a set and a hemisphere.

1035
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,892
There hasn't been a reason
to show you what I'm capable of...

1036
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:27,325
but I'm telling this you now. Go out there.

1037
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,921
Do whatever the hell you want.
There's no way in the world I can stop you.

1038
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,728
But don't come back here...

1039
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,803
and don't come near them.

1040
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,064
Any of them.

1041
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:55,485
Now I have repaid any debt
I may have owed you.

1042
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,820
You know all that I know.

1043
01:14:58,193 --> 01:15:01,720
My voice is the only proof that
you will have of the truth of any of this.

1044
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,526
I might have written a letter
with my signature...

1045
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:07,158
but my handwriting
is not what it used to be.

1046
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,401
Maybe you've had the presence of mind
to record this.

1047
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,032
That's your prerogative.

1048
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:16,134
You will not be contacted by me again.

1049
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:17,439
Good morning.

1050
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,312
Every half-meter.

1051
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,515
Everywhere.

1052
01:15:26,422 --> 01:15:29,216
And if you look, you will not find me.
