1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,149
Here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to read this...

2
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:31,415
and you're going to listen,
and you're going to stay on the line.

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,967
You're not going to interrupt.
You're not going to speak for any reason.

4
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,683
Now, some of this you know.
I'm going to start at the top of the page.

5
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:45,339
Meticulous, yes. Methodical. Educated.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,327
They were these things.

7
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,844
Nothing extreme. Like anyone, they varied.

8
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:53,944
There were days of mistakes
and laziness and infighting.

9
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:58,141
And there were days, good days,
when by anyone's judgment...

10
00:00:58,463 --> 00:01:00,732
they would have to be considered clever.

11
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:03,994
No one would say
that what they were doing was complicated.

12
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:08,477
It wouldn't even be considered new.
Except maybe in the geological sense.

13
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:11,416
They took from their surroundings
what was needed...

14
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,111
and made of it something more.

15
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:16,695
- We haven't even set up an appointment.
- What order date did you put on this?

16
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:19,831
- The 28th. Why?
- I don't know... Yeah, I'm putting 28th.

17
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:24,025
Have you thought any more
about what you want to put forward?

18
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:27,963
- Not really.
- Because I was-

19
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,647
I mean I haven't changed my mind
or anything.

20
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,524
Phillip and I were talking,
and we think it could be good. It'd be fun.

21
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:38,936
Nobody's saying it wouldn't be fun.

22
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:42,932
The time for jacking around with tesla coils
and ball lightning in the garage is over.

23
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,525
Maybe you should try it on your own
in yourfree time.

24
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,563
My free time? The free time
after the 50 hours a week at work...

25
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:52,498
or after the 30 hours of free time
I already spend in that garage?

26
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:54,802
And it's not a tesla coil.

27
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,364
I could save a few minutes a day
by eating on the toilet.

28
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,054
How many patents do we have?
In the last 14 months?

29
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:02,939
- Did you sign the agreement?
- Nobody signed the agreement.

30
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:05,076
Doesn't matter,
we're sticking to the agreement.

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,180
Name one thing out of that garage
that's remotely profitable.

32
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:11,481
I don't see anybody quitting their jobs
because of it. Are you?

33
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,133
Abe just means that right now
the JTAG cards are it.

34
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:18,359
When you look at the addresses, we have
a lot of apartments. A lot of residences.

35
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,361
But these are not the bulk orders
to the OEMs or retail giants.

36
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:23,573
- These are the quiet basement-
- Hackers.

37
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:26,970
Yeah, hacker wannabes
testing their dads' old motherboards.

38
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:31,930
And I know that a lot of that is my fault,
admittedly, you know.

39
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:36,246
With everything last year, and the doubletalk
we were getting from Platts...

40
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:39,859
- and all the stuff we won't get into now-
- We should get into it.

41
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:42,127
I'm sorry. What?

42
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:45,526
Go ahead. Tell him.

43
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:49,296
We should get into it.
I talked to my brother today.

44
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,857
He knows of two other cases like that
at his firm.

45
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,028
- Let Platts know that we're talking about it.
- Look, forget Platts.

46
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:58,479
This has got to be about what
has the best chance of going to market...

47
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:00,724
and what is going to get us vC attention.

48
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:04,055
Look, I stuck by you guys
when it was your turn.

49
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:06,837
And I wasn't 100°%° sure
of what we were doing...

50
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:09,142
or even if I didn't agree, maybe.

51
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,370
But if it's my turn...

52
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:16,180
if we're still playing by the rules,
then this is what I want to try.

53
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:21,494
Here, take it.
They said it wouldn't hold a freeze.

54
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:23,633
Robert, please. It's not going to hold.

55
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,868
- It's going to go bad in my car.
- It'll go bad here. Okay, thanks.

56
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,594
- Good night, all.
- See you.

57
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:34,674
- We just got done giving this huge speech-
- We gave the speech?

58
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:36,719
We just got done. It was five minutes ago.

59
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:41,396
I'm the one that forced the issue. They're
onto us because I suck as the bad cop.

60
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:44,725
- You should do it. You could fake it better.
- I don't know about that.

61
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,053
As long as we're going down this road
where it's eighth grade physics...

62
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:51,468
and happy fun time out in that garage,
I think we could stand to try this.

63
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:54,477
Phillip and Robert are gung ho on theirs,
and that's fine.

64
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,788
But you know I have no interest in that.

65
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:59,124
I know you have no interest,
besides the fact...

66
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:02,900
that Phillip and Robert don't even need us.
They just want to use the equipment.

67
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:05,236
For what I want to do? We don't need them.

68
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:08,019
Not even Phillip,
because it doesn't need software.

69
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:11,444
- Is she asleep?
- No, and she needs a bath.

70
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:15,061
- She'll wind up in the closet if I do it.
- That's fine.

71
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:18,643
You know, even if Robert's okay with it,
and he won't be.

72
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:22,966
- I don't understand what that thing will do.
- We'll let them go at it for two months.

73
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,648
- They do theirs, we do ours.
- They said it'd take 14 hours.

74
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,758
Don't eat that. Seriously, it's bad.

75
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:30,229
We threw the first couple of batches out.
The filter.

76
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:31,951
What about crushed?

77
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:34,764
These guys are funded.

78
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,063
- These guys are... What?
- Liquid helium. These guys are funded.

79
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,726
That's what this is.

80
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,066
That's the whole difference.
That's what the box is.

81
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,166
We don't have to play the game
where we're going back and forth...

82
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,045
coming up with innovative ways to make it
colder and unusable in the process.

83
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:52,175
- Aaron, I need the hexagonal set.
- This is unmarketable.

84
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:54,863
By coming at it from the back end,
rather than changing...

85
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:57,999
the surrounding temperature,
we'll change the level it'll conduct...

86
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:00,818
the transition temperature.
And by bombarding these edges-

87
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,983
They're dropping the ceramic,
the temperature lower and lower.

88
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:07,729
It makes the ceramic less resistant
and knocks out the interior magnetic field.

89
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:10,447
What I'm saying is
we drop the box down on it.

90
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:14,194
Focus our own magnetic field to negate,
knock out with the inverse...

91
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:16,081
what's going on inside the ceramic.

92
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:20,043
That should change the transition
temperature to something we can work with.

93
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:23,443
- What are we saying that is?
- Hopefully, near room temperature.

94
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,246
What is that about?
The best mathematician is a lazy one?

95
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:29,966
- What did you ask for?
- I asked. I need the hexagonal set.

96
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,661
- What did you call it?
- Just come on.

97
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,454
- Are these Type One?
- The superconductors?

98
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,149
Yeah, they're Type One.

99
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,812
Is that going to be a problem?

100
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,666
There's plenty lying around at work,
but they're all bar coded.

101
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:43,211
- If I have to, I'll buy the kits.
- What are you doing about the source?

102
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:44,592
What?

103
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,082
- I can get them.
- You can... Are you sure?

104
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,903
I thought you didn't like this idea.

105
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:52,850
Buy them if you have to.
Everything else we can take care of.

106
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:54,256
What about the source here?

107
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,776
You know that story
about how NASA spent millions...

108
00:05:56,883 --> 00:06:00,527
developing this pen that writes in zero-G?
Did you ever read that?

109
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,922
- And how Russia solved the problem?
- Yeah, they used a pencil.

110
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:06,033
Right, a normal wooden pencil.

111
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,867
It just seems like Phillip takes
the NASA route almost every time.

112
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,523
- Palladium?
- You've got their diagram, what does it say?

113
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:14,481
They use a ratio of platinum and palladium.

114
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:16,466
That's not necessary
with the changes I made.

115
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:18,734
They're just showing off.
If you have it, use it.

116
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,241
I want to get a replacement router.

117
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,305
- I'm putting down four ounces of palladium.
- Did Robert look at it?

118
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,100
- I already got his.
- I can't fix it.

119
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:28,715
- Okay. Where are you getting it?
- Wal-Mart. It's $50.

120
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:31,595
- Okay. Can you get a receipt, please?
- Yeah.

121
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:33,836
Wait, platinum or palladium
is less resistant?

122
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,912
- Abe? It's not a-
- Yeah, I don't care.

123
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:38,407
- So resistance doesn't matter.
- I need an aye or a yes.

124
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:40,455
- Did you jiggle the-
- The collet nut?

125
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:43,180
- Robert did it.
- Well, yes. I guess.

126
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:46,959
- Well, then, which is cheaper?
- You're not going to buy it, are you?

127
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:50,286
Well, unless you've got
a few grams of palladium lying around.

128
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,419
Why would they put it in there
if you didn't need it?

129
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,495
One catalytic converter. It's fine.

130
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:58,153
Remember to put it back.
Your emission just went up 300°%°.

131
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:00,079
- Is there enough in here?
- Yeah, should be.

132
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:03,886
If not, we'll pull the one out of my truck.
Okay, copper tubing.

133
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,220
- This will be out of commission, right?
- Without the tubing?

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,219
- We can use the Freon, too.
- No, it's going to be room temperature.

135
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,334
I know, just in case.

136
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,301
No, wait. Stop. I'll just buy the tubing.
This isn't saving us money.

137
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:31,910
- Jay? Hey, man. How are you?
- Good.

138
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:54,759
Should we be wearing goggles?

139
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:59,143
- Should we be wearing goggles?
- What?

140
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,417
Goggles. Should we be wearing goggles?

141
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,764
Wait. Phillip, you don't want
to come out here.

142
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,967
Phillip, grab a mask, okay?

143
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:54,507
It is, though, right? It's not just me?

144
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:59,045
No, it's definitely smaller, but it just seems
that way. Take what they have.

145
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,058
Minus the coolant which we don't need.

146
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,547
The rest of it is the mercury bath...

147
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:08,743
which you would know better than I do,
but they're probably just showing off.

148
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,446
I mean, you have it, you got to use it, right?

149
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:16,617
- What? Does it hurt?
- No, I didn't feel anything.

150
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:18,919
That sound is just weirding me out.

151
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,305
- What does it feel like?
- I don't know.

152
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:28,483
I don't know if I'm making it up.

153
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:30,853
Here.

154
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:47,302
- Next part. Let's do the next part.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:58,182
Isn't there some sort of glass
or a transparent...

156
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:00,736
Anything we can use as a window? Pyrex?

157
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:02,402
- Yeah, I'm in.
- Okay, drop it.

158
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:05,440
- I don't know of anything
that won't leave a gap in the field.

159
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:07,455
But we got to see what's going on in there.

160
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,114
- How much did that cost?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:13,602
- What?
- You want to put my camcorder...

162
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:17,087
inside the box that's so dangerous
we can't look into it.

163
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:23,141
If something happens,
would you pay me back?

164
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:27,838
So we have a slightly negative pressure
in the box.

165
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:29,893
So we're ready for the argon.

166
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:34,016
- Which one is that?
- It's the blue one.

167
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:37,734
I weighed it at 77 grams.

168
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:40,003
I set the scale to decagrams, though.

169
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,836
I'm showing 7.7 decagrams.

170
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:46,595
Ready for...

171
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:51,302
0.05 liters of argon.

172
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,926
- You ready?
- Just the plate first, right?

173
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:04,805
Right, first just the plate, and then we'll...

174
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,843
Let's just give it a second.

175
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,453
- You want to do the box now?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:34,175
Let's go through the checklist.
Aaron, hold on a second.

177
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:37,823
Let's make sure everything's set up right.
Hold on, Aaron. Wait.

178
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:40,900
Just wait.

179
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:52,993
Okay.

180
00:12:02,085 --> 00:12:03,426
Anything?

181
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,686
- Is this normal?
- I don't know.

182
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,883
- I'm turning it off.
- Wait! No.

183
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:16,450
- Okay, I didn't do that.
- Did we blow something?

184
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Yeah, we did. That's destroyed.

185
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,541
- You want to check your camera?
- Yeah.

186
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:26,818
- Let's get this.
- You ready?

187
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,151
One, two, three.

188
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:45,242
Hey. Tell me you're hungry.
Kara's at her mom's and I'm starving.

189
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,674
Yeah, I'm hungry. What...

190
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,773
Abe, it's 7:00. Abe, it's 7:00 at night.

191
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,175
- Okay, yeah, I have food-
- Okay.

192
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,504
- Wait, are those kids there?
- Just a sec.

193
00:12:58,531 --> 00:12:59,872
Yeah, they're here.

194
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,582
Okay, screw that, let's just go somewhere.
I just pulled in, so come on down.

195
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,617
Come up first. I have some stuff
I want to take back to the shop.

196
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,762
All right, but meet me at the door.

197
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,899
- Okay, all right.
- Seriously, meet me at the door.

198
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:13,857
Okay. All right. See you.

199
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:29,663
- What's up, Abe?
- Hey, Brad. How are you?

200
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:30,936
Good.

201
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:43,451
- How long did he say he would be there?
- Not long.

202
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:46,455
If he's got problems, he's got to fix them.
You're not his dad.

203
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,041
I know. I just thought it would be good
to do something charitable.

204
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:52,828
It definitely is charity.
At least you admit that.

205
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,619
You feel like a steak? To eat.

206
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,816
I don't want a steak. Let's just
grab some tacos on the way to the shop.

207
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,767
- I have some stuff I want to try out.
- Okay.

208
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:08,693
We can get some tacos on the way,
or we can get a steak afterwards.

209
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,931
What are you talking about?
I'm not paying for a steak.

210
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,005
It's stable?

211
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:21,533
Aaron, it's stable?

212
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,736
- What did you do to this thing?
- What?

213
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:35,543
- It looks like a dog digested it.
- Okay, that's the plate.

214
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:38,938
I rigged this into the box
so I could control the feed.

215
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,006
- I figured it's the easiest way-
- It's just controlling the box.

216
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:45,788
The plate stays the same.
What you do is you gradually feed it.

217
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,216
Okay. You hear that? How it's...

218
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:55,515
See, I'm not touching it anymore.
It's growing with its own momentum.

219
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:58,070
It's like a feedback loop,
and it just regulates itself.

220
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:01,786
And what you do is when it gets there,
you bring it back...

221
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:06,034
and there you go, it coasts.
It's stable. It stays like that.

222
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,075
So it works?

223
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:13,171
- Yeah, it does.
- What is that, like 10°%°?

224
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:16,503
It knocks another couple of points
by the time it reaches the peak.

225
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:19,507
You may want to come over here
and take a look at this.

226
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,204
Okay, what am I looking at?

227
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:24,473
- What are we pulling out of the batteries?
- Probably 24 volts.

228
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:26,842
- I mean, no more than that, right?
- Okay.

229
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,566
So your meter's jacked up.

230
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,665
That's what I figured. So I tried three others.
I got the exact same thing.

231
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,520
- I spent all last night-
- What was it?

232
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,198
I spent last night and a two-hour break
just double-checking everything.

233
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:42,130
There's something wrong here. We're not
pulling out more than we're putting in.

234
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:44,375
- Slightly more.
- Well, yeah, whatever.

235
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,258
It's not like a volt and a half
more than we're putting in.

236
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:51,152
It's probably the batteries.
They're cheap batteries, not regulated right.

237
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:52,882
That is weird, though.

238
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,067
You want to see something weirder?

239
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:02,073
Okay, let's go over this again.
Two batteries, right? 24 volts?

240
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,875
What are we pulling out of this one?
Just forfun.

241
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:09,904
Twelve volts.

242
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:22,866
- How about this one?
- Should be 12 volts.

243
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,200
So, what the hell is this thing?

244
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,249
It doesn't stay like that.

245
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,767
No, it winds down in a few minutes.
What does that?

246
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,399
I don't know. I'll tell them something.
I'll tell them we're spraying for bugs.

247
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,774
It should just be a day or two, anyways.

248
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:54,991
- Unless you want to bring them in.
- No, they have their work in there, too.

249
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,131
If Phillip finds out about that
he's going to have to take it apart.

250
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:02,456
- No. I'm just putting a little tweak on it.
- Yeah, I know. No, you're right.

251
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:06,329
Abe, it's my garage, okay?
It's not like they're paying rent.

252
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,737
There was value in the thing.
Clearly. Of that they were certain of.

253
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:13,077
But what is the application?
In a matter of hours...

254
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:16,526
they had pinned it to everything
from mass transit to satellite launching.

255
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,737
Imagining devices the size of jumbo jets.

256
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:21,775
Everything would be cheaper.
It was practical and they knew it.

257
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:23,855
But above all that, beyond the positives...

258
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,032
they knew that the easiest way
to be exploited...

259
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:28,307
is to sell something
they did not yet understand.

260
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:31,724
So they kept quiet.
The parties would continue.

261
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:34,287
Any birthday, anniversary, holiday...

262
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:38,167
maybe some obscure project launch.
It didn't matter. Any reason would do.

263
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:42,550
What was important is that Thomas Granger,
their last best hope of funding, show up.

264
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:46,838
If he left a little earlier than
they would've liked, he couldn't be blamed.

265
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:49,838
He was only there
to please his daughter Rachel.

266
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,398
And she was only there to please Abe.

267
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:56,717
What did you say
to Mr. Granger a while ago?

268
00:17:56,823 --> 00:17:59,474
- Did you flip my burger?
- You can't call him Mr. Granger.

269
00:17:59,574 --> 00:18:01,647
You have to call him, like,
Thomas or something.

270
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,532
- Go ahead.
- No, because he won't take you seriously.

271
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:08,175
- He thinks we're kids.
- If you call him Mr. Granger...

272
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:12,817
he looks at you like you're a 6-year-old kid.
He does it with me. It won't work anymore.

273
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:16,558
Abe had taken on the task
of quantifying and explaining the device.

274
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:19,283
But as weeks became months...

275
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:23,505
their enthusiasm became a slow realization
that they were out of their depth.

276
00:19:04,597 --> 00:19:06,800
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

277
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,802
- Where'd you call?
- Your work and your cell.

278
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,955
I'm not there.

279
00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:14,221
Really?

280
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:18,964
- March Madness?
- It's Carolina and Michigan.

281
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,099
- Who's up?
- I don't even know what.

282
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:24,587
Do you have anything important
at work today?

283
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:28,466
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

284
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:33,072
I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...

285
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:36,018
friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.

286
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:37,676
But how about this instead?

287
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:41,805
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

288
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:44,525
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

289
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:47,179
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

290
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,495
Well, it looks like mustard to me.

291
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:53,839
I know, but it's a film. It's a protein...

292
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,720
secreted by a fungus
called Aspergillus Ticor.

293
00:19:56,818 --> 00:19:57,800
He told you that?

294
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,753
No, he knew it was a protein
but didn't know where it came from.

295
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,883
All he really did was just take some pictures
with their equipment.

296
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:05,262
Guess where we're going.

297
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,631
- Do you know where Will is?
- No, why?

298
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,966
The Ariel meeting
is pushed back till Wednesday.

299
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:12,717
I thought he was waiting around for it.
Where are you going?

300
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:14,956
What do they do with engineers
when they turn 40?

301
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:17,359
- What, Bradshaw?
- Exactly. You know what?

302
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:20,239
I do know where Will is.
I'll let him know on my way out.

303
00:20:20,337 --> 00:20:22,475
- Okay. Thanks.
- Can you meet me out front?

304
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:25,544
- You got to drive.
- Okay, here. Take my keys.

305
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:29,675
Okay, if you can, just pretend
that this is the first time I came in.

306
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,158
And if you would just
tell him exactly what you told me...

307
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:37,198
- Okay, so what is it?
- Protein buildup.

308
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:40,777
- Okay, can you just tell him?
- Protein buildup.

309
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:43,915
- But what kind?
- Some fungus.

310
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,827
- Some fungus.
- Where did it come from?

311
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:50,702
- I don't know. You were to take it to the lab.
- Yeah, that's next.

312
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:53,451
- You were in design, weren't you?
- Yeah.

313
00:20:53,808 --> 00:20:55,302
How did you get over here?

314
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:58,474
Do you know what they do
with engineers when they turn 40?

315
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:00,328
They take them out and shoot them.

316
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:03,279
What the hell, Abe?
You could have just shown me the pictures.

317
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:06,889
- I want you to believe it.
- Believe what, the protein?

318
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,713
- I believe you.
- Okay, look...

319
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:12,111
this guy already thinks it's a joke,
so he may be a little defensive.

320
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,444
Really? Why would he think that?

321
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:28,013
Please.

322
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,692
Aspergillus Ticor.

323
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:34,311
This is a fungus that's everywhere.

324
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:39,050
It's in our bed, our skin,
sometimes even our GI tract. Everywhere.

325
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:44,236
It's basically the reason you don't leave
things in dark, damp, closed-off places.

326
00:21:44,398 --> 00:21:47,049
Thank you.
Do you have that sample I brought?

327
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,979
There it is. Terger. T-E-R-G-E-R.

328
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:59,108
Okay, when I showed you this,
tell him what you thought.

329
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:04,744
- You thought it was a joke, right?
- It is a joke.

330
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:07,555
Right, but how did you know?

331
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,777
Will you show him? Please?

332
00:22:21,517 --> 00:22:24,812
This is how I get protein A
out of Aspergillus Ticor. We sweeten it.

333
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:27,625
We agitate it. We spin it around.
We sweeten some more.

334
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:30,823
- Takes about a month.
- To get the same amount I brought in.

335
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,347
To get the same amount I brought in.

336
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,754
So if it's an incubatorforfungus,
is that valuable?

337
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:37,575
- That's not what it is.
- Then what is it?

338
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:40,905
There's another way to secrete
that much protein. Do it naturally.

339
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:43,142
But that takes a lot longer.

340
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:48,010
If it has a little moisture and it's left alone,
it'll start secreting and it'll build up...

341
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:50,409
- and build up, but it takes a long time.
- How long?

342
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:53,257
- A long time.
- More than a few days? Then how long?

343
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,527
To get the same amount of protein
that we have...

344
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:57,831
the amount that I was wiping off
every five days...

345
00:22:57,931 --> 00:23:00,036
and five days later it would accumulate...

346
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:02,692
he says it would take about five to six years.

347
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,912
I don't want to belittle this guy.

348
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,604
So, I said screw it
and I put my watch in there.

349
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,162
- And?
- I want you to do it.

350
00:23:12,842 --> 00:23:15,559
- Where is it? The box?
- I took it back to the shop.

351
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:20,929
- Wait, digital or old mechanical?
- Exactly. I did both.

352
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,520
- And what?
- I want you to do it.

353
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:29,253
We thought
that we were degrading gravity, right?

354
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,263
That we were blocking that information.

355
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,850
I think we're doing more than that.
I think we're blocking more than that.

356
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:38,915
When you were controlling the feed,
did you notice it was parabolic?

357
00:23:39,178 --> 00:23:42,309
It's important. Parabolas are important.
Here, look at this.

358
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,712
I don't know, Abe.

359
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:47,329
I'm going to start it up
and let it run for 60 seconds...

360
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:49,605
with nothing in it. It's empty this time.

361
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:50,654
That's 22-

362
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:53,379
In all the equations that describe motion
and heat and entropy.

363
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:56,864
In all Feynman diagrams what's the
one variable that you can turn negative...

364
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,336
and still get rational answers for?
It's not mass.

365
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:02,116
Twenty-two hours, 27 minutes in the box.

366
00:24:02,217 --> 00:24:05,380
- It's an odd number.
- That's 1,347 minutes.

367
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:10,399
-1,347, man, you got that fast.
- How did you know it's odd?

368
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:14,399
Because this is it. This is what's going on.
There's an "A" end and a "B" end.

369
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:17,352
Let's say the A end is 12:00,and the B end is 12:01.

370
00:24:17,448 --> 00:24:20,230
All right? We start the machine
with the Weeble at the A end.

371
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:22,662
- It travels forward-
- You got to write this down.

372
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,094
- There's nothing to write down.
- I'll write it down.

373
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:27,166
It travels forward normally
towards the B end.

374
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:29,606
When it gets there,
the feed runs down parabolically...

375
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:32,703
until it should stop, but it curves
back around towards the A end.

376
00:24:32,807 --> 00:24:35,840
When it gets back to the A end...
Curve that around. The Weeble...

377
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:39,139
has experienced a total of two minutes,
and again it curves-

378
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:41,279
- Back around. It curves parabolically.
- Right.

379
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:43,904
It comes back around
and it does this about 1,300 times.

380
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:45,665
When it finally exits on the B end...

381
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,484
it's traveled an odd number
of forward and backward trips.

382
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,878
What is so special about 1,300?
Why is it about 1,300? Why isn't it exact?

383
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:53,949
- This is not empirical.
- Here, give me that.

384
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:57,699
I don't know why it's not exact.
There's some sort of probability there.

385
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,220
Every time it hits the B end
there's a chance...

386
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:03,109
a small chance it won't
curve back around towards the A end.

387
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:06,752
And for some reason, it takes
about 1,300 trips before it finally does.

388
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:10,018
It does have to exit, or else
we wouldn't be able to see it afterwards.

389
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:12,027
Okay, let's take a look at this.

390
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,881
Twenty-two hours, 14 minutes.

391
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:21,791
-1,334 minutes.
- Even.

392
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,728
Enter at the B end.

393
00:25:27,622 --> 00:25:29,280
Exit at the B end.

394
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:35,427
- I just want you to see it the way I saw it.
- I am trying, okay?

395
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:37,892
Everything we're putting in that box
comes ungrounded.

396
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:40,639
And I don't mean grounded to the earth,
I mean not tethered.

397
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:43,774
We're blocking whatever keeps it
moving forward, so they flip-flop.

398
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,877
Inside the box, it's like a street,
and both ends are cul-de-sacs.

399
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,809
This isn't frame dragging or wormhole
matching. It's basic mechanics and heat.

400
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,923
This is not mechanics and heat.

401
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,475
- We can publish.
- Yeah, we can publish.

402
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,969
No, I mean we can really publish.

403
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:06,017
Aaron, the Weeble's stupid. It can't move.

404
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:08,604
Even if we were
to put the Weeble in at point B...

405
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:13,214
it's still going to bounce back and forth
until it's kicked out at the B end.

406
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,170
But if it were smart...

407
00:26:19,939 --> 00:26:23,965
it could enter at the B end
and exit at the A end before it flips back.

408
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:31,771
You're talking about making a bigger one.

409
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:36,223
I didn't say anything.
You're the one talking about it.

410
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:39,129
So, you believe me?

411
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:42,333
No, I don't.

412
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:44,768
Come on. Let's go get a drink or something.

413
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:51,968
- We're going to have to move it.
- We will.

414
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,600
We need a box big enough for a person
to fit into. As far as turning it on-

415
00:26:57,634 --> 00:27:00,732
I was testing the box. It turns out
over half the rings are redundant.

416
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:04,150
The inner ring is strong enough on its own,
so it makes the plate smaller.

417
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:06,265
A lot more is unnecessary.
What we can do...

418
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:10,493
is take a lot of these small plates and
surround a container with a web of them.

419
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,923
How small?

420
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:17,048
It should be accumulative so a lot of
mini-fields equal one big one, right?

421
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:19,616
Yeah, sum of series, that makes sense.

422
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:23,008
What I was going to say is we need
to find a place where we can put it...

423
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:24,893
and turn it on and it won't be disturbed.

424
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:26,999
We could just lock it in a closet.

425
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:30,971
Someplace where someone's not going to
go poking around and messing with it.

426
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:32,665
And climate-controlled.

427
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,582
Yeah, so whatever, we'll find some place.

428
00:27:35,936 --> 00:27:38,751
So, if we go your route with what?
A bunch of mini-fields?

429
00:27:38,848 --> 00:27:42,426
That's a lot of work. We'd have to...
I mean, how many days is that?

430
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:46,874
Abe, you know what we could use?

431
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,135
I know we've seen
a lot of crazy things lately, okay?

432
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:55,006
I know you're still trying to put
it all together in a way that makes sense.

433
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:58,552
Look, I just want you to understand
that what's next is not a prank, okay?

434
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:01,306
I wouldn't do that to you
and I'm not doing that to you.

435
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,630
So when you see this, you can't yell
or make any noise or run anywhere.

436
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:10,036
I know you probably feel like you're
being tricked or made fun of. But you're not.

437
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:12,893
I promise you, you're not. Okay?

438
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:39,514
Who was that, Abe?

439
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:05,496
Let's just wait. Six minutes.

440
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:05,939
Look, you sure you're okay to drive?

441
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:11,955
What did you do all day?
The first time through?

442
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:17,686
I spent the day in a hotel room
in Russellfield.

443
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,549
- I'll just meet you back at the shop.
- I wonder what I did.

444
00:30:24,505 --> 00:30:27,407
- I guess I went back to work.
- Yeah, probably.

445
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:29,368
Probably just worked, I guess.

446
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:32,310
Yeah, probably so.

447
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:38,862
Look, now that I know about this, Abe...

448
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:42,166
don't do this again, okay?
Not where it affects me.

449
00:30:46,617 --> 00:30:48,078
Go ahead.

450
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:54,838
Hey, Rachel.

451
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:37,039
Why not the lottery?

452
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:40,017
We can if you want,
but it's not until Saturday.

453
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,461
And even if we win the full $10 million,
that's only $200,000 for the next 30 years.

454
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:48,148
- And that's just one good trade.
- A couple days like this.

455
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:51,508
- I was just running a test. In and out.
- I want to do what you did.

456
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:52,948
Exactly what you did.

457
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:55,828
- The first thing I did is call in sick.
- Okay, I did that.

458
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:59,635
- Then I drove to the storage facility.
- But I need to drop Lauren at school first.

459
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,222
Then meet me there.
We're going to need both cars.

460
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:05,293
We need to park yours down the road,
out of sight of the facility.

461
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:08,180
- Why are we doing that?
- Because we need a ride home.

462
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:09,772
- What is that...
- It'll make sense.

463
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,983
Okay, I'll be patient.

464
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:15,434
When I got to the storage room,
I flooded the box with argon...

465
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:19,120
and I had to tighten it up
to secure the leaks.

466
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:21,995
- There's leaks?
- There's always leaks.

467
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:30,092
At 8:30 a. m., I set the timer for 15 minutes...

468
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:33,459
I jumped in the car,
and drove to Russellfield.

469
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,765
Okay, I lost it.

470
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:37,421
- What?
- Why the timer?

471
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:41,490
Because the moment we start those
machines is the moment we'll end up...

472
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:44,206
- getting out of them, and-
- Right. Got it. Sorry.

473
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:46,893
I don't want to be standing around
when they do.

474
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:52,115
While I was on the road at 8:45,
the machine kicked on by itself...

475
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:56,107
and by 8:49, it was completely warmed up.

476
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:07,979
In Russellfield, I got a hotel room
and tried to isolate myself.

477
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,350
Wait, what do you mean "isolate"?

478
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:13,037
I closed the windows,
I unplugged everything in the room...

479
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:15,027
the telephone, TV, clock, radio, everything.

480
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:17,993
I didn't want to take the chance
of running into someone I knew...

481
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,987
or seeing something on the news
that might...

482
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,824
If we're dealing with causality,
and I don't even know for sure.

483
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:26,027
- I just...
- What?

484
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,452
- Took myself out of the equation.
- Err on the side of caution.

485
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:30,602
Yes.

486
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,091
Then what did you do all day?

487
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:40,555
- I just sat there. I had some books, but...
- What? Were you nervous?

488
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:43,658
Yeah.
It's mind-numbing, all the second-guessing.

489
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,776
"Evacipate. "

490
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:58,088
At 3:30 p. m.,
I stopped by Williams Medical Supply.

491
00:33:58,193 --> 00:34:00,200
Picked up a Class E oxygen tank and mask.

492
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:03,818
I called my mutual fund company and asked
which stock in their mid-cap fund...

493
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:05,743
had the greatest percentage gain that day.

494
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:08,689
The idea was just to get enough information
for one good trade.

495
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:11,370
Can we just download chart data
and trade on each movement?

496
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:15,728
But if we do that, I want to use the library
in Russellfield, use their computers.

497
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,193
So, I got to the storage room at about 3:15
and cut off the power to the box.

498
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:36,813
It cycled down to a tolerable level
at about 3:19.

499
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,910
The trick is to get in
after it reaches a comfortable level...

500
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:43,179
but before it shuts off completely.
There's a window there.

501
00:34:43,343 --> 00:34:45,198
So, does it hurt?

502
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:48,200
Yeah, it does a little.

503
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,039
It's not bad if you wait for the right time.
It's like a small static shock.

504
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:54,598
- Once you're in, you're fine, though.
- What?

505
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,993
I know you've done it,
and I can only assume that you don't have...

506
00:34:58,095 --> 00:34:59,982
cancer or male impotence.

507
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,664
But what is your opinion
on how safe this thing is?

508
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,036
I can imagine no way
in which this thing would be...

509
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:07,174
considered anywhere remotely close to safe.

510
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:10,628
All I know is I spent six hours in there
and I'm still alive.

511
00:35:13,135 --> 00:35:14,957
You still want to do it?

512
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:33,833
I set the alarm on my stopwatch
for six hours.

513
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:37,862
I regulated the O2 tank,
took some Dramamine, and tried to sleep.

514
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,720
Did you?

515
00:35:39,981 --> 00:35:41,803
- What?
- Did you sleep?

516
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:46,060
Not at first. I've never
considered myself claustrophobic...

517
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:50,118
but I started sweating and I couldn't find
the right flow rate on the tank...

518
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:54,468
and I was breathing differently than I was
when I was testing it on the outside.

519
00:35:54,573 --> 00:35:56,875
Eventually, I settled down, and...

520
00:35:57,229 --> 00:36:01,025
I don't know, maybe it was the Dramamine
kicking in, but I remember this moment...

521
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:03,816
in the dark
with the reverberation of the machine.

522
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:07,212
It was maybe the most content
I've ever been.

523
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,106
I woke up on my own without the alarm...

524
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:15,553
and waited for the machine to cool down.
Cool down from my perspective.

525
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,409
It got to a point where it sounded safe
to get out...

526
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,963
but the stopwatch still showed
a couple minutes...

527
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:23,336
so I trusted the math and waited.

528
00:36:58,027 --> 00:37:01,572
That's not a static shock, Abe.
Okay, please stop it.

529
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,252
You got out too soon.

530
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:14,495
You have to wait for the stopwatch
so that you know the gain is low enough.

531
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,515
So, we're back here?

532
00:37:16,937 --> 00:37:20,352
Yeah, we're here.
It's 8:50, Tuesday morning.

533
00:37:24,297 --> 00:37:26,272
All right. Give me a few minutes.

534
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:32,607
From there it was easy.
The bulk of the work was done.

535
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:35,909
I just left everything the way I found it.
I left the machine alone...

536
00:37:36,009 --> 00:37:38,856
and didn't turn it off,
and just cleared out of there.

537
00:37:38,953 --> 00:37:43,208
So your double would find everything
the same later that day and get in the box?

538
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:47,647
Right, but also, I or my double or someone
was in the box coming backwards.

539
00:37:47,753 --> 00:37:50,851
So who knows what that would've done
if I'd turned the machine off.

540
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:53,341
Definitely. So, they're one-time use only.

541
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:57,671
So then, at that moment, since my double
was on the way to the hotel in my car...

542
00:37:57,768 --> 00:38:01,630
I had to take a taxi home. But when we go,
we'll be able to use your truck.

543
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:24,672
- You have a margin account, right?
- Yeah. I do now. What are we buying?

544
00:38:24,775 --> 00:38:28,517
Good. Today, before 12:30, we'll buy
as many shares as we can of RGWU.

545
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:34,048
They'll say their earnings that quarter
are three and a half times consensus...

546
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,020
and the stock will nearly double
in afternoon trading.

547
00:38:38,854 --> 00:38:40,894
- What do they do?
- What do you mean?

548
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,201
What does this company do?
Do they make things or-

549
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:45,790
I don't know.
All that matters is the price goes up.

550
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:50,401
The volume is so high that the number
of shares we trade won't affect the price.

551
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,070
You really don't know what they do?

552
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:04,065
That's why you spoke about a mid-cap fund,
so volume is high enough to hide us.

553
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:06,172
- Do you think it's too cautious?
- I don't know.

554
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,382
I know there's a lot of other stocks
out there...

555
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:11,551
that do a lot more than double,
but this is my first day.

556
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,407
- My God.
- She's not going to answer.

557
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:51,197
I know, Abe. That's the question.

558
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:56,121
I know, so what's the answer?
You've got the $400 billion...

559
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:59,675
you've gone the charity route,
you have this perfect 100-room mansion...

560
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:02,048
with matching his and her yachts
and helicopter pads.

561
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:04,995
Basically, you have absolute impunity
to do whatever you want...

562
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:06,039
nobody can touch you.

563
00:40:06,147 --> 00:40:08,121
- You're back from a two-year-
- Above the law.

564
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:12,896
Absolutely, well above. You're fresh back
from this two-year world-galloping vacation.

565
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:14,969
How do you fill your day? What do you do?

566
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:19,231
Abe, I know that's the question, but it's not
a real question, so why does it matter?

567
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,672
So what's the answer?

568
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,447
Babe, he knows that's the question, okay?
He's asking you the question.

569
00:40:24,835 --> 00:40:28,250
What do you mean? What would I do
with my life or what would I do tomorrow?

570
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:29,564
My God, either.

571
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:35,031
I'd have to do something constructive.
I'd have to do something that would help...

572
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:38,651
- something that would make me feel good.
- I know. That's fantastic. Good.

573
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:43,423
- My wife. So good. So pure. You are pure.
- Shut up. Why did you ask, then?

574
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,675
This is what I would do:
I would wake up tomorrow morning...

575
00:40:47,777 --> 00:40:50,111
and I'd go over to Gabriel Capital Inc...

576
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:53,821
and I would tell Joseph Platts' receptionist
that I'm there to see him...

577
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:55,547
and when he comes out...

578
00:40:56,993 --> 00:40:59,710
I would ram my fist
through the flat of his nose.

579
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:04,470
Just one good punch, one good pow.

580
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:09,019
- That's amazing. It's about time.
- That is so great.

581
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,706
Where did this come from?
You're always defending the guy.

582
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:14,264
- It's unnatural.
- I'd only do it if I knew that...

583
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:16,026
no one would find out or get hurt.

584
00:41:16,128 --> 00:41:19,357
Like, I wish that there was a way
that I could do it...

585
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:21,212
and then I go back and tell myself not to.

586
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,279
Because I just want to know
what it feels like. That's all, really.

587
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:25,529
I'm so proud.

588
00:41:25,888 --> 00:41:29,270
Finally, my husband, the hero.

589
00:41:35,264 --> 00:41:38,330
- We can't do that.
- I know.

590
00:41:38,688 --> 00:41:40,313
Did you call pest control?

591
00:41:41,087 --> 00:41:44,764
Babe, they're birds. You don't want a bunch
of dead baby birds up there, do you?

592
00:41:44,864 --> 00:41:48,725
- They don't sound like birds.
- She thinks there are rats in the attic.

593
00:41:49,695 --> 00:41:51,604
But the idea had been spoken...

594
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:54,711
and the words wouldn't go back
after they had been uttered aloud.

595
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:56,342
So you are understanding this, right?

596
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:58,868
You don't have to sell me
on not doing this, okay?

597
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,876
- I don't think I told you-
- Even if you do stop yourself...

598
00:42:01,983 --> 00:42:05,398
your double, from hitting Platts,
why would he, your double, get in the box?

599
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:08,818
And with no need for it,
no possible real-world application...

600
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:12,434
no advantage at all to be gained from it,
the idea stayed.

601
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:16,371
- How would you do it?
- I wouldn't.

602
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:19,186
- Just for fun.
- I still wouldn't.

603
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:22,010
- But what if there was a way to-
- Look, Abe, look.

604
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:25,461
I'm not going to pretend
like I know anything about paradoxes...

605
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:28,827
or what follows them, and honestly,
I really don't believe in that crap.

606
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:32,569
Kill your mom before you were born,
whatever. It has to work itself out somehow.

607
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:34,709
- I don't know.
- This is what I know for sure.

608
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:38,708
The worst thing in the world is to know
that the moment you are experiencing...

609
00:42:38,813 --> 00:42:41,496
has already been defined,
that this is the second...

610
00:42:41,597 --> 00:42:45,339
or third time through, or whatever.
And do you ever feel like...

611
00:42:46,364 --> 00:42:49,976
I don't know, maybe things aren't right,
like maybe your life is in disarray...

612
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:54,070
or just not what you would like
and you start to wonder what caused this.

613
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:57,268
People are always blaming their parents...

614
00:42:57,372 --> 00:43:00,536
as if, if their mom had breastfed them,
their lives would be different.

615
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:01,749
Bunch of whiners.

616
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:04,886
Yeah, they are. But what if it wasn't
something you wonder about?

617
00:43:04,988 --> 00:43:07,858
What if you knew this is not the way
things are supposed to be?

618
00:43:07,964 --> 00:43:11,925
I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole
"destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing.

619
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:13,849
I'm not, either. But what's worse?

620
00:43:13,947 --> 00:43:16,914
Thinking you're being paranoid
or knowing you should be?

621
00:43:22,587 --> 00:43:25,238
You don't have to look at me like that.
I'm okay.

622
00:43:31,163 --> 00:43:33,847
No, I just assumed that you would.
I trust her.

623
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:37,591
- I know that when I decided to tell you-
- Decided to tell?

624
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:42,583
I knew that you are married and that there's
no secrets. Anything I tell you, she'll know.

625
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:44,144
- It's not a matter of trust.
- I know.

626
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:46,771
It's just how much better will it be
if in a few days...

627
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:50,191
I surprise her and we all just fly
to Costa Rica or somewhere for a month?

628
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:53,681
We'll let her understand it gradually.
Maybe do some real estate shopping-

629
00:43:53,786 --> 00:43:56,568
For now, you can tell her
you had a good day in the market.

630
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:57,681
- You don't understand.
- No.

631
00:43:57,786 --> 00:44:00,153
You don't understand the questions
that come with that.

632
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,671
But we'll explain it to her,
and we'll take some time...

633
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:03,923
to figure out what's next...

634
00:44:04,025 --> 00:44:07,440
which, I think, should be building
a bigger box, like the size of a room...

635
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,302
where more than one person could fit in.

636
00:44:09,402 --> 00:44:12,401
Safe or not,
the thing feels like a coffin the way it is.

637
00:44:13,113 --> 00:44:14,804
By the way, this is our guy.

638
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:19,477
- What's the volume?
- Five-and-a-half.

639
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,577
What's the return? Holy...

640
00:44:25,305 --> 00:44:29,396
No, I can't beat that. But mainly, I guess
I was just talking about Robert and Phillip.

641
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:30,642
I don't want to tell them.

642
00:44:30,744 --> 00:44:32,915
I know they have a lot invested
in the group-

643
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:34,325
I don't want to tell them.

644
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:37,523
If you need me to take the guilt on this one,
fine, okay?

645
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,315
I accept it gladly. It's mine.

646
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:41,969
At the end of this week,
they can have whatever they want.

647
00:44:42,072 --> 00:44:45,203
I'll turn over patent rights on everything
from the last two years.

648
00:44:45,304 --> 00:44:47,573
They can have the equipment,
the garage, the house.

649
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:50,421
They can have my truck
if that makes you feel better.

650
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,487
But I am not telling them a thing
about this. We're not.

651
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,809
God, everything is so different in there.

652
00:45:09,911 --> 00:45:11,885
You can feel how cut off you are.

653
00:45:12,215 --> 00:45:15,063
It's this entirely separate world
and you encompass most of it.

654
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:18,475
And the sound.
Isn't the sound different on the inside?

655
00:45:18,646 --> 00:45:21,843
It's like it's singing.
I guess you can't hear it on the outside-

656
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:25,325
- I had this dream in there.
- About what?

657
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:31,599
I was on or near the ocean,
and I just kept hearing the surf.

658
00:45:32,086 --> 00:45:33,515
It was so uneventful.

659
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:37,142
At night.
And the tide kept coming in and out.

660
00:45:49,398 --> 00:45:52,049
Come here for a second, man.
What's on your hand?

661
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:54,320
- Are you bleeding?
- That is blood.

662
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:55,915
- Turn around.
- You see it?

663
00:45:56,022 --> 00:45:58,323
Where is it coming from? It's your notebook.

664
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:01,388
- It's you. My gosh, it's on your ear.
- What is this?

665
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,881
- Your ear's bleeding. Man.
- Give me that. I got it.

666
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:11,156
- Is that normal? This isn't normal.
- For the machine?

667
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:15,153
for people.
You think it's the machine? I got it.

668
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:34,442
Great. I can actually
get some work done today.

669
00:46:34,548 --> 00:46:35,857
Hi, guys, what's going on?

670
00:46:35,956 --> 00:46:38,672
I always seem to get a lot more done
when I'm not locked out.

671
00:46:38,771 --> 00:46:40,145
He says they had to spray again.

672
00:46:40,243 --> 00:46:43,091
But he can't tell us about it in advance.
Is Hero even here?

673
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:45,424
You never see anything around here
but those geckos.

674
00:46:45,524 --> 00:46:47,084
- I know.
- I think it's for the geckos.

675
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:48,496
- What?
- Why?

676
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:51,758
- Hey, man, thanks for the present.
- How is that working out for you?

677
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:55,437
You know what? You guys, both of you,
you make fun, but there is a difference.

678
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:56,750
Wait. What did you call him?

679
00:46:56,851 --> 00:46:58,826
- What?
- When you walked in? What did you say?

680
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,337
- He didn't tell you about it?
- No.

681
00:47:00,435 --> 00:47:04,396
All right. Rachel's ex-boyfriend
walks into my birthday party with a shotgun.

682
00:47:04,498 --> 00:47:05,873
- What?
- Swear to God.

683
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,694
I've already gotten that speech from Kara.

684
00:47:07,794 --> 00:47:10,063
- Filby!
- You'll get it. You have a wife and kid.

685
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:13,326
It's funny how you two are the only people
that have a problem with it.

686
00:47:13,426 --> 00:47:15,793
- Everybody else thinks I did a good thing.
- You didn't.

687
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:19,152
You can't risk your life and
especially the welfare of Kara and Lauren...

688
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,232
for someone like Rachel.

689
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,313
She practically begs
for this to happen to her.

690
00:47:22,418 --> 00:47:23,945
I figured at least you'd understand.

691
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,937
Understand what?
You've never been like this.

692
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:29,579
That's what I mean.
You see how different things are now.

693
00:47:30,226 --> 00:47:32,298
Different? How are things different?

694
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,759
You see it, okay? I know you do.

695
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,980
Look, that was the night...

696
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:42,567
you had told me everything
about the machine.

697
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:46,219
Everything you showed me was so fresh
in my head and when I saw this guy...

698
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,776
I'm looking at him.
I wasn't going to let him do that.

699
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:51,532
I wasn't going
to let him scare people like that.

700
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,775
I know it was stupid, okay?

701
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:57,264
But I mean, this whole idea,
this whole thing that we're doing.

702
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:02,183
It just took some getting used to for me.
I wasn't completely acclimated to it.

703
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:05,669
If it was just you, you had to worry about,
I'd still think you're stupid.

704
00:48:05,776 --> 00:48:08,525
But you have a family now,
and God, especially now...

705
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:10,380
anything like this would be crazy.

706
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,349
- I know, okay.
- I know you know that, but you've got to...

707
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:16,357
- I know, okay?
- Filby!

708
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:22,244
You little sack of...
Even if you see him, don't tell me.

709
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:25,831
It's not my fault if I don't know,
and I just hope the thing runs away.

710
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:27,593
Then what are we doing out here?

711
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:31,373
She worries about the cat.
So you look for the cat. It's what you do.

712
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:42,797
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

713
00:48:42,895 --> 00:48:46,059
It's embarrassing that the storage room guy
sees us come in together...

714
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,304
but he never sees us leave.

715
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:49,773
Yeah, but what do you think
the receptionist thinks...

716
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:53,220
about two guys that come
and get a room for six hours every day?

717
00:48:56,526 --> 00:48:57,933
Did you unplug this?

718
00:49:01,646 --> 00:49:03,686
You brought your cell phone?

719
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:07,044
Can I check the caller ID?

720
00:49:09,006 --> 00:49:10,697
Yeah, we're not back.

721
00:49:11,757 --> 00:49:14,539
Yeah, but you can't take it back
with you, okay?

722
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,194
This is Aaron. Hey, babe.

723
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:26,088
I'm not there. I had to come downtown
and hold some of these guys' hands.

724
00:49:26,189 --> 00:49:27,334
Tell me.

725
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:31,592
That sounds good.
No, I've got to eat with these offsite fags.

726
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:33,897
Save mine, though. I'll have it later.

727
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:38,721
Okay. Yeah, 6:00.

728
00:50:38,986 --> 00:50:40,841
- What?
- What?

729
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:44,711
We're supposed to win this by two,
they just turned over with 12 on the clock.

730
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,520
- We have to foul.
- No.

731
00:50:48,906 --> 00:50:52,419
What? No, we foul here,
they miss the first free throw...

732
00:50:52,522 --> 00:50:54,594
- and they come back with the three.
- Three points.

733
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:55,843
That's right.

734
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:05,060
Man, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten since later this afternoon.

735
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:09,895
What's up, you guys?

736
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,389
- You have got to be kidding.
- I'm sorry. I forgot it was in my pocket.

737
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:22,082
- It's Kara?
- Yeah.

738
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,911
How do cell phones work?

739
00:51:27,016 --> 00:51:29,765
If there's two duplicate phones
and I call the same number...

740
00:51:29,864 --> 00:51:32,035
do they both ring at the same time,
or is there...

741
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,209
- That's not how they work.
- It's a radio signal.

742
00:51:34,312 --> 00:51:35,522
No, it's a network.

743
00:51:35,624 --> 00:51:38,559
It checks each area and
when it finds the phone, it stops ringing.

744
00:51:38,664 --> 00:51:40,191
It rings the first one.

745
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:45,186
- This one is ringing.
- Right.

746
00:51:45,288 --> 00:51:47,492
So the one your double has in Russellfield
can't be.

747
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:49,566
Right. I think we broke symmetry.

748
00:51:50,823 --> 00:51:53,954
- Are you sure that's how cell phones work?
- No.

749
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:57,217
You feel all right?

750
00:51:57,991 --> 00:52:00,063
- I feel fine. Do you?
- Yeah.

751
00:52:28,038 --> 00:52:30,111
Is Kara asleep? Did I wake you up?

752
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:33,988
Yeah. No, not me, it felt more like a nap.

753
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:37,762
I think my body's getting used to
these 36-hour days. What's going on?

754
00:52:37,861 --> 00:52:40,033
We can do this, but we have to do it now.

755
00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:42,784
- Do you have his home address?
- Why now?

756
00:52:42,886 --> 00:52:45,952
We were planning on taking a trip
tomorrow, right? Just like today?

757
00:52:46,053 --> 00:52:47,231
Yeah, for stocks.

758
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:51,589
Okay, well, half an hour ago I was asleep.
This car alarm woke me up.

759
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:54,336
These kids were down skating by,
hitting cars on the block.

760
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:58,234
So we go right now, do our business
at Platts', get back in the box...

761
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,762
and come back before
those kids set off those alarms.

762
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:04,666
All we really have to do is stand there
in plain sight. That should scare them off.

763
00:53:04,772 --> 00:53:06,659
That way my double
sleeps through the night...

764
00:53:06,756 --> 00:53:11,033
they don't have this conversation,
and they get in the box tomorrow as usual.

765
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:16,192
- They'll be changed. But-
- Yeah, but at least they'll get in the box.

766
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:22,016
Wait, how do we go back that far
if the machines haven't been running?

767
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:27,488
- Have they been running?
- Yeah.

768
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:30,936
I started going by at 5:00,and turning them on, 5:00 p. m.

769
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:33,756
I got tired of the whole
unanswerable question-

770
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,729
Are we doing this as an experiment
or are we doing this for me?

771
00:53:36,835 --> 00:53:39,388
- A little of both.
-5:00.

772
00:53:39,491 --> 00:53:43,102
If we get this done by 3:00,
that's 10 hours in the box.

773
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:46,169
I've got the O2 tanks in the car.

774
00:54:01,186 --> 00:54:03,739
- Is that...
- Is that Rachel's car?

775
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:08,634
No, that's not Rachel's, that's her dad's.
They have the same kind.

776
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:10,142
Did you see that?

777
00:54:10,946 --> 00:54:14,394
That's Mr. Granger. That's Thomas.
He's sitting in that car.

778
00:54:14,786 --> 00:54:15,768
What?

779
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:18,461
I swear that was him.
What the hell is he doing...

780
00:54:18,562 --> 00:54:21,278
sitting outside my house
at 2:00 in the morning?

781
00:54:23,297 --> 00:54:25,664
I don't believe this.
What, is he following us?

782
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,315
- What are you doing?
- Let's just see what he wants.

783
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:31,232
No, let's just get out
of my neighborhood first. Come on.

784
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:33,663
- Did you see him today?
- No.

785
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:37,822
I did. I saw him this afternoon...

786
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:39,546
around 6:00.

787
00:54:39,649 --> 00:54:41,820
Are you sure you didn't see him
when we drove past?

788
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:43,001
No, what?

789
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:46,454
I'm positive this afternoon
he was clean-shaven. I know he was.

790
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:48,862
He was ready to go to some function
with his wife.

791
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,448
He looks like he's got
a two or three-day growth now.

792
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:54,552
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm not sure, but I think so.

793
00:54:59,264 --> 00:55:01,652
Rachel. This is Abe. Did I wake you up?

794
00:55:03,392 --> 00:55:06,327
Can I get your dad's number
from you real quick?

795
00:55:06,912 --> 00:55:08,919
Yeah. Okay, go ahead.

796
00:55:11,168 --> 00:55:13,339
- Yeah, thanks.
- What's he doing?

797
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:15,931
He's just sitting there.

798
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:19,931
He got out for a second
and I thought he was coming over...

799
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:23,317
and then he got back in the car.
I think he's drunk.

800
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:25,910
Hi, sorry to call so late.

801
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:28,791
May I speak to Thomas Granger, please?

802
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:33,208
Yeah, this is James Miller
from Putney and Myers.

803
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:36,027
Hi, Mr. Granger?

804
00:55:37,343 --> 00:55:38,772
Thomas Granger?

805
00:55:42,782 --> 00:55:45,149
What are you doing here? Come here!

806
00:55:59,741 --> 00:56:01,148
What happened?

807
00:56:02,302 --> 00:56:03,993
I'm okay. I slipped.

808
00:56:14,429 --> 00:56:17,778
I want to know what box he used.
You built one for you, right? Just one.

809
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:19,924
Yeah. How many do you think I made?

810
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:26,042
These are set right. I turned them on at 5:00.

811
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,954
He could have used one
and gone back to 5:00.

812
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,191
He could be in one of them right now.

813
00:56:34,397 --> 00:56:36,982
I say we shut them off
and see if he's in there.

814
00:56:38,076 --> 00:56:39,735
Were you planning on talking to him?

815
00:56:39,836 --> 00:56:41,941
Just tell me if you were.
I'm not going to be mad.

816
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:43,800
No, I promise you. You know I wouldn't.

817
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,077
Are you sure you wouldn't?

818
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,994
You're the one he can't get near
without passing out.

819
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,630
There is no way
I would tell anyone about this. No way.

820
00:56:52,732 --> 00:56:54,772
- Can you think of any reason you might?
- No.

821
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:57,592
Sometimes we do things
but don't know how we got to that point.

822
00:56:57,691 --> 00:56:59,098
- No, I can't.
- Can't what?

823
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:01,912
I can't think of any reason why I would.

824
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:04,758
Well, I can't either.

825
00:57:05,435 --> 00:57:07,442
What if it was an emergency?

826
00:57:08,251 --> 00:57:12,658
- So you'd do it if it was an emergency?
- No, I don't know. What, so you might then?

827
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:15,445
I don't know. What kind of emergency?

828
00:57:16,827 --> 00:57:18,649
The permutations were endless.

829
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,676
They tried again going to the source...

830
00:57:22,778 --> 00:57:25,397
but even while keeping him separated
from Abe by two rooms...

831
00:57:25,498 --> 00:57:26,447
Ask him his name.

832
00:57:26,554 --> 00:57:29,172
...Granger's condition
could only be described as vegetative.

833
00:57:29,274 --> 00:57:30,615
What did he say?

834
00:57:30,714 --> 00:57:33,169
From this they deduced
that the problem was recursive...

835
00:57:33,274 --> 00:57:36,754
but beyond that, found themselves
admitting, against their own nature...

836
00:57:36,858 --> 00:57:39,246
and once again,
that the answer was unknowable.

837
00:57:39,354 --> 00:57:40,979
- What do you think he changed?
- Not much.

838
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:44,530
We didn't have any contact with him
in the 3 hours he could've done anything.

839
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:48,463
I know he changed this. I know we weren't
having this conversation the first time...

840
00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:49,813
so you don't know what we lost.

841
00:57:49,913 --> 00:57:51,375
It really could not have been much.

842
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:54,165
It doesn't matter how much.
It just matters that it's changed.

843
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:55,443
I know what you're saying.

844
00:57:55,545 --> 00:57:56,789
The question should have been...

845
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,223
what to do with the comatose man
in the guest bedroom.

846
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:02,867
But in Abe's mind
he was already compiling the list.

847
00:58:08,857 --> 00:58:10,482
Two mg of oral triazolam...

848
00:58:10,585 --> 00:58:15,189
every seven hours induces a safe sleep state
and a minimal metabolic rate.

849
00:58:16,728 --> 00:58:18,288
At this continued state of rest...

850
00:58:18,392 --> 00:58:21,207
the human body breathes
0.3 liters of oxygen a minute...

851
00:58:21,305 --> 00:58:23,726
or roughly 2,000 liters in four days.

852
00:58:24,408 --> 00:58:27,604
A Class E oxygen tank holds 625 liters.

853
00:58:28,408 --> 00:58:29,717
To maintain hydration...

854
00:58:29,816 --> 00:58:33,776
the body cycles through a minimum
of two-and-a-half liters of water per day.

855
00:58:34,103 --> 00:58:36,176
Any food would be a luxury...

856
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:38,928
but the small tank
of medical grade nitrous oxide...

857
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:41,006
would be needed on the other side.

858
00:58:41,656 --> 00:58:44,754
Past the room that contained their machines
and up two levels...

859
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,546
he made his way to another room...

860
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:51,154
where he had stored what I will refer to
from here on as the Failsafe Machine.

861
01:00:28,115 --> 01:00:30,668
There he is.
I've been calling you all morning.

862
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:33,322
Really?

863
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:35,852
Your cell and work.

864
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:42,154
I'm not there.

865
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:43,371
Really?

866
01:00:48,402 --> 01:00:49,929
I don't even know what.

867
01:00:52,627 --> 01:00:53,837
I'm just tired.

868
01:00:54,002 --> 01:00:58,060
I hope you're not implying
that any day is unimportant at Cortex Semi.

869
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,643
I was going to come give you
this big speech about how we've been...

870
01:01:13,746 --> 01:01:16,495
friends for a long time and built up trust,
that whole thing.

871
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:18,000
But how about this instead?

872
01:01:18,097 --> 01:01:22,058
If you ditch work this afternoon and promise
to do the few small things I ask you...

873
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:24,812
I will in return show you
the most important thing...

874
01:01:24,912 --> 01:01:27,400
that any living organism has ever witnessed.

875
01:01:28,912 --> 01:01:32,841
At this point
there would have been some discussion.

876
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,182
Abe would, of course, want to know how.

877
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:43,372
Aaron would have to explain
all about the storage manifest...

878
01:01:43,472 --> 01:01:46,788
and how it showed two rooms
under the name Abram Terger.

879
01:01:47,152 --> 01:01:50,152
Then Abe would need to know how.

880
01:01:51,536 --> 01:01:53,609
Aaron would explain
that when he went up there...

881
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,500
and found the Failsafe running...

882
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,607
he knew exactly what it was.

883
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:00,938
But Abe would ask how.

884
01:02:01,711 --> 01:02:04,493
And then the bit
about the modular design of the coffins...

885
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:08,203
and how it meant he could fold one up
and take it back inside another.

886
01:02:08,655 --> 01:02:10,728
They are not one-time use only.

887
01:02:10,831 --> 01:02:13,287
They are recyclable, Aaron would say.

888
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:20,489
How, Abe would ask.

889
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:26,380
And Aaron would describe
how simple things become...

890
01:02:27,182 --> 01:02:30,597
when you know precisely
what someone will have for breakfast...

891
01:02:30,702 --> 01:02:32,841
even in a world of tamper-proof lids.

892
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:55,458
How?

893
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:59,211
And that's where
I would have entered the story.

894
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,676
Or exited, depending on your reference.

895
01:03:03,853 --> 01:03:07,366
Because when Aaron came back
the second time, it wasn't so easy.

896
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:11,970
He wasn't expecting me to put up a fight.

897
01:03:12,076 --> 01:03:15,110
And by that time,
he was too exhausted to take me.

898
01:03:16,428 --> 01:03:19,145
But for reasons
that are only evident to me now...

899
01:03:19,372 --> 01:03:21,707
I understood that he simply wanted it more.

900
01:03:21,804 --> 01:03:25,121
That he just had more invested. So I left.

901
01:03:25,772 --> 01:03:28,870
He had already performed the task,
as I had intended to...

902
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:32,267
of recording the conversations of the day
just in case.

903
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,329
Through that earpiece
he had a three-second lead on the world.

904
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:38,185
Aaron, you need some sleep.
Some real sleep.

905
01:03:38,763 --> 01:03:41,349
I can't. I've got a schedule.

906
01:03:42,955 --> 01:03:46,338
He had but to speak aloud the words
that came into his head...

907
01:03:46,443 --> 01:03:48,712
and those around him would fall in line.

908
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:09,832
This is Track 3.

909
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,192
Abe is bringing my car around
and I am on my way to the court.

910
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,403
I'll see Will there.

911
01:04:14,506 --> 01:04:18,401
I'll invite him to the party and make sure
he's bringing Rachel's boyfriend.

912
01:04:19,082 --> 01:04:20,097
Will.

913
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,238
You pretentious prick.

914
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:25,509
What the hell is that?
Is that your cell phone?

915
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:28,097
- No, it's a radio, man.
- You look like Secret Service.

916
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:31,431
- You look like Secret Service.
- Ariel meeting is moved to Wednesday.

917
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,831
What? What the hell
am I hanging around here for?

918
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:35,303
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

919
01:04:35,401 --> 01:04:37,059
Nice shot, Aaron.

920
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:41,183
Brick. That is ugly, Aaron.

921
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:43,329
We could have used that
last week against TI.

922
01:04:43,433 --> 01:04:46,531
At least you've got your golf game.
I see you've been practicing.

923
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:50,179
You come out here with your $3 tie
and think you can play whiteball.

924
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:52,136
What are you doing tonight?

925
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:55,232
I was supposed to be in Raleigh.
Thanks to you I missed my flight.

926
01:04:55,337 --> 01:04:56,547
- You know Robert?
- Yeah.

927
01:04:56,649 --> 01:04:59,038
He's got a birthday tonight.
Why don't you come out?

928
01:04:59,144 --> 01:05:02,941
- I'm just going to hang out with my cousin.
- Bring him. Rachel will be there.

929
01:05:03,048 --> 01:05:05,088
- Big reunion.
- Exactly.

930
01:05:20,615 --> 01:05:22,688
I don't think I'm doing this.

931
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:25,567
Why not?

932
01:05:26,695 --> 01:05:29,892
Because I can think of a million
different ways that this can happen...

933
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,814
and nobody comes anywhere near
getting hurt.

934
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:34,694
I can call her and see
if she wants to do something else...

935
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:36,963
or better yet,
not even talk to her about the party.

936
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:39,998
That's good for tonight. What about
tomorrow? And every other day?

937
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:42,951
- I'll take care of tomorrow, tomorrow.
- You'll watch her always.

938
01:05:43,046 --> 01:05:46,461
This guy is crazy enough to walk
into a room of people waving a shotgun.

939
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,934
What do you think he'll do
if he everfinds her alone?

940
01:05:49,031 --> 01:05:52,326
This way, we know exactly what happens.
We have complete control over it.

941
01:05:52,423 --> 01:05:55,489
At the end of the night,
this guy is arrested and goes to jail.

942
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:58,208
That's the way it goes.
Your words, not mine.

943
01:05:58,822 --> 01:06:00,131
Now come on, it has to be you.

944
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,525
She said she was there
because you told her you would be there.

945
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:11,586
Don't tell me I came back
and did this for nothing.

946
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:17,058
He doesn't fire?

947
01:06:18,469 --> 01:06:20,095
- No. He didn't fire.
- He neverfires?

948
01:06:20,197 --> 01:06:22,434
- Not even when you rushed him?
- No. He didn't.

949
01:06:22,533 --> 01:06:25,184
He didn't the time I was, when I rushed him.

950
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:27,772
And from what Robert tells you,
he didn't do it tonight.

951
01:06:27,877 --> 01:06:30,179
He doesn't have the nerve.
We know everything.

952
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,772
Okay? We're prescient.

953
01:06:38,437 --> 01:06:39,866
We can still be careful.

954
01:06:39,973 --> 01:06:42,558
Maybe we can get to the gun
without him knowing.

955
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,193
We definitely can.

956
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:47,675
He leaves it in the truck
before he goes in. We don't even need to...

957
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:51,195
- but if it makes you feel better-
- What's wrong with our hands?

958
01:06:53,348 --> 01:06:54,690
What do you mean?

959
01:06:54,788 --> 01:06:56,959
Why can't we write like normal people?

960
01:06:59,268 --> 01:07:01,756
I don't know. I can see the letters.

961
01:07:03,779 --> 01:07:08,383
I know what they should look like.
I just can't get my hand to make them easily.

962
01:07:09,187 --> 01:07:12,154
Try comparing it to your left hand.
Mine looks the same.

963
01:07:31,107 --> 01:07:33,278
Guess what today is.

964
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:38,040
No, no. It's yourfriend Robert's birthday.

965
01:07:39,426 --> 01:07:42,110
He says he likes records,
so I got him The Best of Bread.

966
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,901
No, real records, like vinyl.

967
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:48,317
I can tell you with certainty
what I did that night when it was my turn.

968
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:53,083
But I think it would do little good,
because what the world remembers...

969
01:07:53,186 --> 01:07:56,732
the actuality,
the last revision is what counts, apparently.

970
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,126
So how many times did it take Aaron...

971
01:08:00,225 --> 01:08:02,713
as he cycled
through the same conversations...

972
01:08:02,817 --> 01:08:05,152
lip-synching trivia over and over?

973
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:08,733
How many times would it take
before he got it right?

974
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:10,621
Three? Four?

975
01:08:11,745 --> 01:08:12,857
Twenty?

976
01:08:14,017 --> 01:08:17,148
I've decided to believe
that only one more would have done it.

977
01:08:17,248 --> 01:08:20,118
I can almost sleep at night
if there is only one more.

978
01:08:20,961 --> 01:08:24,954
Slowly and methodically,
he reverse-engineered a perfect moment.

979
01:08:27,168 --> 01:08:29,557
He took from his surroundings
what was needed...

980
01:08:29,665 --> 01:08:31,770
and made of it something more.

981
01:08:43,808 --> 01:08:46,907
And once the details had been
successfully navigated...

982
01:08:47,007 --> 01:08:50,138
there would be nothing left to do
but wait for the conflict.

983
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:57,370
Maybe the obligatory
last-minute moral debate...

984
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,122
until the noise of the room
escalates into panic...

985
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:03,289
and background screams
as the gunman walks in.

986
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:08,348
And eventually he must have got it perfect
and it must have been beautiful...

987
01:09:08,447 --> 01:09:11,032
with all the praise and adoration
he had coming.

988
01:09:11,135 --> 01:09:13,556
He had probably saved lives, after all.

989
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:18,425
Who knows what would have happened
if he hadn't been there?

990
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,099
I know that things are bad, okay?

991
01:09:36,829 --> 01:09:39,579
I know that you don't agree
with what I've done.

992
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:41,269
I know that you're upset.

993
01:09:41,373 --> 01:09:44,853
And to be honest, I'm not too happy
with you, either, right now.

994
01:09:45,437 --> 01:09:48,154
But you know that this is going to pass.
Let's just go.

995
01:09:48,253 --> 01:09:51,068
Let's go somewhere
where we don't speak the language.

996
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:53,108
Aaron, we don't have the money back here...

997
01:09:53,213 --> 01:09:54,969
and we'd have to steal our own passports.

998
01:09:55,069 --> 01:09:56,891
Money? We'll make money.

999
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:59,221
They have sports betting in vegas.
March Madness.

1000
01:09:59,325 --> 01:10:02,139
We'll make enough in one night
to finance a thousand vacations.

1001
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:05,171
Passports. You know
they're not using theirs, anyways.

1002
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:07,956
Now, come on. I'm thinking Star City.

1003
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:10,395
Check out the cosmonaut training grounds.

1004
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,081
I'm staying here.

1005
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:14,003
Why?

1006
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:26,202
They'll be building their own boxes
in another day.

1007
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,438
And yours already knows what they've built.

1008
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:31,573
You're not going to be able
to watch them forever.

1009
01:10:32,636 --> 01:10:34,676
The box Abe is building won't work.

1010
01:10:35,195 --> 01:10:36,853
He's got it wired wrong.

1011
01:10:37,531 --> 01:10:38,993
And if they fix that...

1012
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:41,947
I'll start actually taking pieces out of it.
It's just a gimmick.

1013
01:10:42,044 --> 01:10:43,156
It doesn't work anymore.

1014
01:10:43,259 --> 01:10:45,942
Your double will say
they have to move on to something else.

1015
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:47,895
And mine will agree. They're friends.

1016
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:49,719
You're staying? Why?

1017
01:10:49,915 --> 01:10:51,824
Why? Let's see, why would Abe stay?

1018
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:54,800
What possible reason could there be
to be here?

1019
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:00,505
I guess that
it just won't go back far enough, will it?

1020
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:05,363
Tell you what, why don't you take Kara
and Lauren and put them in the box...

1021
01:11:05,466 --> 01:11:09,460
and then you and Aaron can each keep a set
and you can stop feeding off it.

1022
01:11:09,562 --> 01:11:12,279
- Don't come back.
- You can each keep a set and a hemisphere.

1023
01:11:12,378 --> 01:11:15,193
There hasn't been a reason
to show you what I'm capable of...

1024
01:11:15,289 --> 01:11:17,526
but I'm telling this you now. Go out there.

1025
01:11:17,626 --> 01:11:20,974
Do whatever the hell you want.
There's no way in the world I can stop you.

1026
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:22,707
But don't come back here...

1027
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:24,697
and don't come near them.

1028
01:11:25,786 --> 01:11:26,866
Any of them.

1029
01:11:41,913 --> 01:11:44,531
Now I have repaid any debt
I may have owed you.

1030
01:11:45,145 --> 01:11:46,771
You know all that I know.

1031
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:50,511
My voice is the only proof
that you will have of the truth of any of this.

1032
01:11:50,616 --> 01:11:53,202
I might have written a letter
with my signature...

1033
01:11:53,304 --> 01:11:55,726
but my handwriting
is not what it used to be.

1034
01:11:58,136 --> 01:12:00,754
Maybe you've had the presence of mind
to record this.

1035
01:12:00,856 --> 01:12:02,318
That's your prerogative.

1036
01:12:02,424 --> 01:12:04,334
You will not be contacted by me again.

1037
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,585
Good morning.

1038
01:12:08,056 --> 01:12:09,299
Every half-meter.

1039
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:12,371
Everywhere.

1040
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,688
And if you look, you will not find me.
