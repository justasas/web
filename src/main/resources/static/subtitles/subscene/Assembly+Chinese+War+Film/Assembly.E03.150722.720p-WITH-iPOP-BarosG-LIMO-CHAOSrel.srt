4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,160
<i>Sang Pil, you run
for the office.</i>

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,020
<i>If I run for the office, what?
You think things will change?</i>

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,860
<i>I wanted the strategic
nomination.</i>

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,310
<i>At least you can tell me who you are
thinking about in Gyeongjae District.</i>

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,850
<i>I wish for you to run as an
assemblyman under the Gookmin Party.</i>

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,750
<i>Just how much money did
you get from the company?</i>

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,110
<i>Why did it have to be him?</i>

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,610
<i>Without saying too much,
let's rescind Jin Sang Pil.</i>

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,803
<i>In the beginning most
refuse but I have not seen</i>

13
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:37,930
<i>a single person who could
refuse until the end.</i>

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,260
<i>Am I really doing
the right thing?</i>

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,620
<i>In politics, the quality of a person
is more important than the career.</i>

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,900
<i>I have to be a good Assemblyman.</i>

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,130
<i>There is a hyung that I like the most.
Because of him, I have to do it well.</i>

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,510
<i>Then, do it well. Do well!</i>

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,230
<i>Sang Pil.</i>

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,560
<i>Sang Pil, Hyung Dal Soo...</i>

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,700
<i>What did you just say?</i>

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,880
<i>He fell from a crane, you punk!</i>

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,640
-Hyung Dal Soo did?<br>-He was
taken to Gyeongjae Hospital.

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,720
Wait.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,720
The atmosphere over there
must be frightening.

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,560
If you just go, some
unpleasant thing may happen.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,530
-So what? Are you saying
I shouldn't go?<br>-Yes.

28
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,710
Yes.

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,690
Stop talking nonsense.

Look. Look. Sang Pil came.

32
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,280
Who the heck are you
that you show up here?

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,820
You ask because you don't know?

34
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,560
-I guess he came to boast about becoming
an Assemblyman.<br>-Get out of my way.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,920
This leper bastard! Where
are you coming in?

36
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,340
Hey, punk. Let this go.

37
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,960
Why are you blocking? Let him go.
You guys!

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,410
I am sorry but
please move aside.

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,430
Now, you know how to pretend being gentle.
Stop showing off and get out of here.

40
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,330
I said for you to stop!

41
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,020
-Go back!<br>-Let this go!

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,940
- Where are you
going?<br>- Let me go.

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,800
Hey, let this go!

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,910
You can't get in!

45
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,190
What do you think you are doing?

46
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,170
Assemblyman.

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,020
Please calm down.

48
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,090
Sang Pil, over there.

49
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,690
Move. Move. Move.

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,570
<i>Hyungnim! Hyungnim!</i>

51
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,830
<i> Hyungnim! Hyungnim!</i>

52
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,550
<i> Hyungnim!</i>

53
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,700
<i>I think the police have contacted
Bae Dal Soo's younger sister.</i>

54
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,209
Quickly contact the ship
building company to tell them

55
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,660
to meet with the younger
sister as soon as possible.

56
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,890
The usual compensation and the
funeral, just in case he dies,

57
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,220
tell them to settle with her
on other options as well.

58
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,310
Yes, I understand,
Secretary General.

59
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,158
-Are there any other
family members?<br>-He used to

60
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,700
have a son but he gave
up his parental rights.

61
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,400
Becoming a policeman is your dream but
why didn't you go to the police academy?

62

<i> Actual Police
Officer Examinations</i>

63
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,710
<i>Episode 3</i><br>Are these the actual exam
questions from the last few years?

64
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,013
Of course. I asked questions after
searching the Police Exam Cafe

65
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:58,130
(INTERNET SITE) and asking all
of the policemen whom I know.

66
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,340
But really,

67
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,340
did CEO Choi ask you
to make this for me?

68
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,034
I said yes already but
why are you asking me so

69
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,640
many times? Anyway, since
I did the most work,

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,860
if a question comes from that, you
have to buy me something yummy.

71
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,080
Yes, if it comes out.

72
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,230
Hello?

73
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,860
<i> By any chance, is this Bae
Gyu Hwan's phone number?</i>

74
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,180
Who are you?

75
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,400
<i>Aigoo. I realized it's you when
I heard your voice right away.</i>

76
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,880
<i>Gyu Hwan! I am your
paternal aunt.</i>

77
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
You got a wrong number.

78
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,600
<i> I will do as you wish.</i>

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,460
<i>From now on, I don't have
a biological father.</i>

80
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,350
<i>Yes, I'm Gyu Hwan.
What is the matter?</i>

81
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,260
<i>I wasn't going to
contact you but</i>

82
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,539
<i>because he's your biological
father, I thought</i>

83
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:15,940
<i>you should know. <br>That's
why I am calling you.</i>

84
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,170
<i>Whatever happens to that
person, I have no interest.</i>

85
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,690
<i>Your Father is in the
hospital right now.</i>

86
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,950
What did you say?

87
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,840
<i> As the result of the last by-election
for the 19th Assembly held yesterday,</i>

88
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,080
<i>each of the ruling party and opposition
parties won 2 seats so they are tied.</i>

89
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,060
<i> Therefore, the ruling
party, Gookmin Party,</i>

90
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,690
<i>retains with 151 seats, more
than half of the Assembly seats.</i>

up a lot.<br>-<i> <br>The Googkmin

<i> Next in the news...
the candidate honored</i>

94
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:50,720
<i>with the most votes in
this by-election is...</i>

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,520
-Yes. Sunbae-Nim.<br>-<i> Jin Sang Pil,
candidate from Gyeongjae City .</i>

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,580
Bae Dal Soo has been
moved to the ICU.

97
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,720
What about the surgery result?

98
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,680
The medical staff didn't tell us but
the surgery result doesn't look good.

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,190
What about Assemblyman Jin?
Is he still at the hospital?

100
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:18,540
Isn't it true that there are many
ways to make a man into a bastard?

101
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,780
Even if it were not so, this
punk, lacking ability...

102
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,830
became an Assemblyman and it makes
me suffocated and my brain explode.

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,020
Hyung, you're being too much.
Hurry and wake up.

104
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,250
You have to wake up so you can climb
not only a crane but Mt. Everest.

105
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,210
You have to go up to the top and
shout out with a microphone.

106
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,470
That Jin Sang Pil, in order
to become the nominee,

107
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,880
betrayed his colleagues
and Hyung like a scumbag.

108
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,230
Huh?

109
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:13,330
Hyung. Wake up quickly. Seriously.
Why are you lying there?

110
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,180
What did I do so wrong?

111
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,630
It was you, who made me the chairman
even though I didn't want to.

112
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,560
Please wake up.

113
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,230
When the sun rises, the
reporters will come.

114
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,510
So?

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Do you want me to run away?
Did I commit a crime?

116
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,990
Think coolly. It won't be
good if you cross them.

117
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,170
Whatever happens, happens.

118
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,290
I just arrived. Where
are you, Aunt?

<i> I have to do the
Assembly job well.</i>

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,910
Even if I can put the public
into the second place,

123
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,710
because of Hyung, whom I like
the most, I have to do well.

124
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,220
Ahee. This noodle is hard.

125
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,180
Skip the election press interview and
hand out the press release only.

126
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,060
To the reporters, who call to get
comments from Assemblyman Jin.

127
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,810
Assistance Seo, you
give a few words.

128
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,410
As you know, please no comment
about Bae Dal Soo's case.

129
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,770
Would it be better if
you do it, instead?

130
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,730
- What are you talking about?<br>- I am
in a hurry to do something else.

131
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,820
I have to register
him at the Assembly.

132
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,600
Assemblyman Jin,
please accept this.

133
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
It's a certification for being elected
from the National Election Commission.

134
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,260
What are you doing here
instead of going to Seoul?

135
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,400
What you are holding
isn't a drink, is it?

136
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,610

Assemblyman Jin!

137
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,840
Assemblyman Jin!

138
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,510
Then, I'll be going to the
National Assembly Building.

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,870
Doctor!

144
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,820
Dad, can you recognize me?

145
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,500
It's me, Gyu Hwan.

146
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,330
You came.

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,740
Dad, try waking up.

151
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,120
It's me Gyu Hwan and
not Jin Sang Pil.

153
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,960
Take care of my son.

154
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,230
My son...Gyu Hwan

155
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,340
is going to be a police officer.

156
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,330
Dad.

157
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,250
I have to see him wearing
the police uniform

158
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,910
before I die.

159
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,410
Certainly

160
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,950
I'll show you when I am
wearing the police uniform.

161
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,950
Choi In Kyung, you are tough.

162
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,220
Woman Warrior. Warrior.

163
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,920
Come out.

164
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,880
So that you can work off the alcohol,
go to a sauna and get some rest.

165
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,340
Think of a reporter looking
at you in this condition.

166
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,581
From the first day of your term,
the gossip article of your

167
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:04,620
being drunk will spread all
over the internet and SNS.

168
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,950
it will become wallpaper
on the internet and SNS.

169
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,980
Whether it becomes wallpaper
or smeared all over the place,

170
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,090
it has nothing to do with you.
Isn't that right?

171
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,020
For a person who so badly
didn't want to become an aide,

172
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,880
it's strange.

173
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,070
Hello?

174
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,680

175
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
<i>are you perhaps with him?</i>

176
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,590
Go ahead and talk.
I'll relay it to him.

177
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,440
Yes.

178
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,430
I understand.

179
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,450
Assemblyman Jin,

180
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,920
Bae Dal Soo has

181
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,430
passed away.

182
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,170
<i>Even though he was transported by
ambulence to a nearby hospital,</i>

183
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,120
<i>he untimately died.</i>

<i>The police who investigated
the case concluded that</i>

00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,198

something happened to Daddy?

187
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,960

190
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,040
The death of Bae Dal Soo is

191
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,590
not a simple death from fall,
but the product of conspiracy,

192
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,210
between Jin Sang Pil
blinded by the nomination

193
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:55,750
and the immoral leaders

received to defect to the ruling party

198
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,160
and resign from the
Assembly right away.

#7014? Kim Gyu Hwan?

203
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,870
What is the reason for wanting
to become a police officer?

204
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,120
-Kim Gyu Hwan.<br>-Yes.

205
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,660
Please tell us your
motive for applying.

206
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,880
It was my father's wishes.

207
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,320
-If you were to make it, you
father will be very happy.<br>-Yes.

208
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,795
I am not sure whether you
read the news but even

209
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,040
this morning, an unfortunate
thing happened.

210
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,796
Tell us the opinion of
each of you about the

211
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:57,380
culture of the aggressive
demonstration.

212
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,372
The freedom of demonstration
or gatherings

213
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:01,760
guaranteed by the Constitution
should be protected,

214
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,880
but aggressively violent
demonstrations should not be allowed.

215
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,240
Demonstrators must also
improve their awareness.

216
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,955
Also, the incident of death
of the laid off employee

217
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,400
at Korea Shipbuilding
&amp; Repairs Company,

218
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,651
is a tragedy born of
misunderstandings, that if you

219
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:14,970
keep making an impossible
demand, it will be granted.

220
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,630
As for me,

221
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,960
I too,

222
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,200
think that is wrong.

223
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,580
Is that it?

224
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,020
Please put more efforts into your answers.
Didn't you prepare for the interview?

225
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,030
I too have a prepared answer.

226
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:49,180
However, if I say that, I don't
think I can forgive myself.

227
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,830
What did you say?

228
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,800
Climbing the crane was
making an impossible demand?

229
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,970
That's right. It
may seem that way.

230
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,680
However, you listen to
me, you son of a bi*ch.

231
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,400
The real reason that person
went on the crane is

232
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,170
because he had no place

233
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,240
to stand on the ground.

234
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,020
So, he had no other
place to go but there.

235
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,210
You understand?

How can they finish a

240
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,880
Is that woman his
real younger sister?

241
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,910
Because the company wanted
to finish it quickly,

242
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,750
they gave her money.

243
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,500
Byeon Sung Gi, over there...

244
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,610

your show, get out you jerk.

245
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,420

able to close his eyes. Get lost, you punk.

246
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,670
Just go away.

247
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,430
Why do you come here? Get lost!

248
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,620
Get out here! Get lost!

249
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,150
Get lost! Quickly!

250
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,960
Get lost.

251
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,650
Would you say a word about the opposition
parties' demand for your resignation?

252
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,110
I have nothing to say.

253
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,620
What do you think about the claim that you
betrayed the deceased to get nominated?

254
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,270
Move aside.

255
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,590
What did I do?

256
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,040
It is time for the
assemblyman to go now.

257
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,750
Let's go without saying
anything, quickly.

258
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,080
Right. Let's go.

259
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,340
Let me go.

260
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,950
What do you really
want to ask me?

261
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,160
What do you really
want to write about?

262
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,970
You want to write that I
killed that person, right?

263
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,010
Because I was crazy
about the gold badge,

264
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,050
I secretly schemed
with the company

265
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,020
and ignored my colleagues and
made that person climb the crane.

266
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,720
Don't you want to
write that way?

267
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,240
Write whatever you want to.

268
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,970

you want to!

269
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,150

270
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,710
Say that Jin Sang
Pil is a murderer!

271
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,950
I killed Bae Dal Soo. Write it.

272
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,450
I will not even blink my eyes.

Before your introduction,

296
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,570
give a brief apologetic
statement in regard to

place at the mortuary.

Did I really do wrong?

If you were a common
person, you might not me.

301
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,420
But as a politician,
you did very wrong.

302
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,980
Not the incident during the
condolence, but the nomination.

303
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,700
I thought that was the best way.

304
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,100
People think very differently.

305
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,570
About that, it is hard
for me to say something.

306
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:27,180
If you give a sincere apology
tomorrow, you won't have

307
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,660
any problem with
legislative activity.

308

legislative activity?

There was one call to
Joo Hee this morning.

From the Assemblyman?

340
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,380
Yes. Because the call was made from a

341
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,230
What did he say?

342
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,790
That he went to cool his head so even if
he doesn't call, not for us to worry.

343
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,810
Ahew, it's certain
that he is hiding out.

344

not appeared at the luncheon?

understanding because he
wasn't feeling too good but

347
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,950
it's a bold faced lie.

348

and all communication has been cut off.

policeman in Gyeongjae

is no misinformation.

Secretary General Baek,

352
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,060
he must be having
a difficult time.

one Assemblyman? subtitles ripped by riri13

354
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,710
It's my fault. I was
too complacent.

355
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,256
Let's tell the
prosecutors and National

356

look into the matter.

Assemblywoman Hong.

358
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,840
-Why? I can't?<br>-Of
course you can't.

359
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,340
-Assemblyman Jin is not a criminal.<br>-Did
I say that he was a criminal?

360
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,830
-It's because the situation is
dire.<br>-If the situation is dire,

361
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,570
is it okay to break the law?

362
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,910
This is a very serious
violation of human rights.

363
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,225
Assemblywoman Hong, weren't
you the secretary for

364

Committee for Human Rights?

365

00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,070
Look here, Choi In Kyung.

367
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,580
Yes, Chief Lim.

Why should we keep it closed-door<br>when
there is no sensitive issue to discuss?

376
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,260

Oh!

381
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,350
Party Leader, long time no see.<br>I
trust you have been well.

382
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,660
Yes.

383
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,140
Aigoo, I'm so dazzled it is
hard to shake your hand.

384
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,440
Assemblyman Park, you're
a king of hyperbole.

385
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,630
Aigoo, Secretary General Baek,

386
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,510
You've worked hard
for the election.

387
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,790
Thank you.

388
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:49,210
How nice that your
work bore fruit...

389
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,730
Furthermore, there is an item
to change the party rules

390
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,730
to staff the Recruiting Committee and
Women's Committee with full-time employees.

391
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,010
I will finish my briefing
of the party business.

392
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,370
Are there any assemblymen
with separate items?

393
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,380
Good, all good.

394
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,237
The opposition parties are
trying to politicize the death

395
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:28,020
of the Korea Shipbuilding &amp;
Repairs laid-off worker.

396
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,730
We must not allow
such ugly old ways.

397
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,570
The best response to
unreasonableness is no response.

398
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,630
Our party can only look
after the people's lives.

399
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,690
Very good comments, good.

400
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,140
All good,

401
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,830
but about Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil's response...

402
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,970
I think it's a bit lacking.

403
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,450
Even though it's because
of his inexperience,

404
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,810
at times like this, he
should be more forward

405
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,010
and give his explanations

406
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,580
as well as retorts
where appropriate.

407
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,150
So our party can
be at more ease.

408
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,330
Because Assemblyman Jin was very
close to the late laid-off worker,

409
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,210
I think he feels morally responsible
to an extent that's unnecessary.

410
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,170
Please consider it as his taking
time out to self reflect.

411
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,610
But self reflection and hiding

412
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,020
are very different matters.

413
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,160
Assemblyman Park, did
you just say hide?

414
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,200
What basis do you have
to say such a thing?

415
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,170
What do you mean a
basis to hiding?

416
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:55,580
If he doesn't answer his phone and if no
one knows where he is, isn't that hiding?

417
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,930
Is there anyone here who can contact
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil right now?

418
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,290
Since we already have
many reporters here,

419
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,620
I will say a word.

420
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,110
As a senior assemblyman, I urge
you, Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

421
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,820
Hury and show yourself
before the people

422
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,070
and explain yourself
and apologize.

423
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,450
One more word.

424
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,020
In the event this event
grows even worse,

those of you who have led the party's
nomination of Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil,

426
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,570
I hope you make responsible

resignations from party posts.

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,800
I will separately get Assemblyman
Jin's permission later.

508
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,990
Hire some interns for now.

509
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,560
Yes.

510
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,020
Hello.

511
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,220
Did you call me?

512
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,600
I've thought about it a lot
after hearing your words.

513
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,100
You are right.

514
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,760
I was too much.

515
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,990
No, I was a coward.

516
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,190
I overreacted. I am sorry.

517
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,260
Even if it's to wash away
(ATONE FOR) my cowardice,

518
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,950
I don't plan to just sit and watch
Jin Sang Pil crumble any more.

519
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,110
What are you saying?

520
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,530
I hope you help out
Assemblyman Jin.

521
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,870
Are you

522
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,510
asking me to be
Assemblyman Jin's aide?

523
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,250
Just a few months will do.

524
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,360
Help him just until he hits the
ground running at the Assembly.

525
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,578
Assemblyman Jin is a person
who can't possibly hit the

526
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,860
ground running, not in a few
months, not in a few terms.

527
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,210
Bismarck said,

528
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,230
politics is the art
of the possible.

529
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,750
There is nothing
impossible in politics.

530
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,150
Let's stop.

531
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,950
This is a meaningless
conversation.

532
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,800
Assemblyman Jin is in a
expulsion crisis and

533
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,720
nobody knows where he is.

534
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,420
Assemblyman Jin

535
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,120
is at Tae Ahm Temple
in Tongyoung.

536
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,900
When you know where he is,

537
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,090
why are you doing nothing?

538
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,050
My going there to forcefully drag
him back...<br>That's meaningless.

539
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,360
Assemblyman Jin will
keep causing trouble

540
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,205
and every time, I will
be hounded by clamors

541
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:05,100
to take responsibility
for his nomination.

542
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,861
A person whom Assemblyman
Jin trusts and who

543
00:40:07,873 --> 00:40:10,400
can stay by his side
to help him must go.

544
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:18,040
As for me, I wish you
can bring him back.

545
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:10,510
Bae Dal Soo is comfortably
resting at a good place.

546
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,930
No place could be
worse than here

547
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,130
because anywhere people
live, it's hell.

548
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:34,220
Politics was made so that people's power,
not God, can save that hellish place.

549
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,480
Right now, you are refusing that
precious role and responsibility.

550
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,200
Just tell me why you came.

551
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,240
If you do not attend the
special assembly session,

552
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,930
your expulsion
will be submitted.

553
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,450
I was going to resign after I
send off Hyung Dal Soo but

554
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,080
I'm thankful they are
expelling me on their own.

555
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,700
I'll help you.

556
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:09,950
I'll be your aide.

557
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,700
Now, please go and
attend the Assembly.

558
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,690
If you didn't eat, have some
temple food before you go.

559
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,820
Are you really going to
be this irresponsible?

560
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,410
You want to throw away the position
that the people voted for you?

561
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,380
People are having hard
time making a living.

562
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,990
At least, let's lessen
one more mouth to feed.

563
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,750
Aren't you embarrassed in front of Mr.
Bae Dal Soo's memorial altar?

564
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,500
Even under the worst of
circumstances, Bae Dal Soo

565
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,860
went the path he chose.

566
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,290
Unlike you, he didn't
run away like a coward.

567
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,030
Let's stop it already.

568
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,120
Assemblyman Jin.

569
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:22,510
I understand why you
are acting this way.

570
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,100
How much you liked Mr. Bae Dal Soo and
so<br> how much you're suffering now...

571
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,680
Stop it already!

572
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,160
I said for you to stop.

573
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,130
-Just stop
now.<br>-Don't run away.

574
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,830
That is how you
are going to make

575
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,900
Bae Dal Soo's death
worth something.

576
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,290
I'll wait for your call.

577
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,330
Yes, Joo Hee.

578
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,700
Why didn't you call.
I was worried.

579
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,670
I'm sorry. Your dad
was a bit busy.

580
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,740
Dad, are you okay?

581
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,770
Of course, I am.

582
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,800
How about your mother?

583
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,050
Did your mother say
anything because of me?

584
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:29,740
She didn't say anything.

585
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,860
Check your phone. She
may have called you.

586
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,730
Okay, I got it.

587
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,560
Let's hang up.

588
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:49,880
This woman is just too much...

589
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,670
<i>Hyung Dal Soo</i>

590
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,690
<i>You've got mail.<br>1
New Message</i>

591
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,470

00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,130
<i>It's the first message.</i>

<i>Sang Pil, it's me, Dal Soo.</i>

594
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,660
<i>I had something to tell you but
since you aren't answering,</i>

595
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,130
<i>I guess you are super busy.</i>

596
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,030
<i>I don't have to see the voting
result because it's so obvious.</i>

597
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,150
<i>Sang Pil, congratulations.</i>

598
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:29,340
<i>My only wish was to
be reinstated but</i>

599
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,910
<i>now, I have one more wish.</i>

600
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:35,450
<i>That is for you to do well.</i>

601
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,440
<i>It's you becoming
an assemblyman who</i>

602
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,010
<i>gives hope to people like us.</i>

603
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:47,490
<i>I am about to climb a crane.</i>

604
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:52,510
<i>I will come down even if only one
of my two wishes comes true.</i>

605
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,820
<i>Even if I don't
get the job back,</i>

606
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,730
<i>if you become an assemblyman who
receives the people's applause,</i>

607
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,830
<i>I will come down.</i>

608
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,660
<i>See you then.</i>

609
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,820
Yes, right now I am in
front of the Assembly

610
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:30,970
Hall where a special
session is about to open.

611
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,810
The main session is about
to open in a few moments,

612
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,810
but Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil
cannot be seen anywhere yet.

613
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,360
Secretary General,

614
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,920
-Didn't you get any call
from Assemblyman Jin?<br>-No.

615
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,800
Seriously, he is an
incomprehensible human.

616
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,130
Because of Assemblyman Jin, I heard
that you were having a difficult time.

617
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,190
Of course not.

618
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:17,180
It's just that I don't feel good about
you aligning with the opposition party.

619
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,570
Since you've only
worked all this time,

620
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:23,000
stepping down and taking a break

621
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,320
won't be too bad.

622
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,250
He must come...

623
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,180
Do you think he'll come?

624
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,250
We have to leave it
up to the heavens.

625
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:01,000
If I last just one more year,
I get civil servant pension.

626
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:05,780
It's not working out too
well in the last year.

627
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,140
<i>Jin Sang Pil</i>

628
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:36,080
Since we have a quorum, we
will open the first meeting of

629
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,810
Assembly plenary session.

630
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,130
Before we start with
the orders of the day,

631
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,620
the four assemblymen elected
in the by-elections

632
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,840
will swear in first.

633
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:57,970
Assemblymen Jin Sang Pil,
Lim Jin Gyu, Jung Jae Won

634
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:03,090
Hong Sung Min, please
come out to the podium.

635
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,100
Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil, aren't you here?

636
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:14,010
No, he is not here.

637
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,970
I will go to submit the
expulsion proposal.

638
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,190
<i>Disciplinary Dismissal of
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil</i>

639
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,000
Because Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil is not present,

640
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,060
only the three assemblymen
will swear in.

641
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,260
Everyone in your seat, please...

642
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,160
Wait!

643
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,500
Please take good care
of me, Aide Choi.

644
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,600
Congratulations on your first
attendance, Assemblyman.

645
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,380
What qualification do
you have to enter here!

646
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,600
Don't speak roughly to
your fellow assemblyman.

647
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,810
Shut your mouth!

648
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:10,130
All Assemblymen and
women, please stand up.

649
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,530

the people of Korea that

00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:38,370

655
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:58,930

668
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,330

00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:48,300
I heard that you almost lost the secretary
general position because of me.

00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,200
I'm really sorry.

672
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:53,320
It's okay.

00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,400

Just...

675
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,830
I cannot overlook it twice.

676
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,910
Do you understand?

677
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:16,750
Oh, oh, of course. If I
repeat something like that,

678
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,590
then I'm really a
total scoundrel.

679

Don't worry.

00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:33,220
My respected citizens of Korea
and fellow assemblymen,

681
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,987
I hereby make it clear
that the allegations of

682
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,660
collusion with Korea
Shipbuilding Repairs Co.

683
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,070
that some party members
made are baseless.

684
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,780
As I have explained earlier,
I can firmly state that

685
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:51,150
it was a win-win settlement that Mr.
Bae Dal Soo wanted as well.

686
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,560
Consequently, I do
not bear any...

687
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,730
legal or moral responsibility
for his death.

688
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:06,790
Finally, people of
Korea, I am sorry.

689
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,380
At a co-worker's
regrettable death,

690
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,920
I felt unbearable sadness.

691
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:28,880
What? Unbearable sadness...?

692
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:37,790
An assemblyman and his
aide will stay there.

693
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:41,130
Please find a quiet and affordable
place as soon as possible.

694
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,520
Is there any place affordable
and quiet in Yeouido?

695
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,800
You said the intern job
interview was today, right?

696
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,340
Please give me the applications of
those who have passed on the papers.

697
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,260
- Here it is.<br>- Okay.

698
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,570
Hello!

699
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,990
Here.

700
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,840
Hello.

701
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,390
-Put it down somewhere
appropriate.<br>-Yes.

702
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,650
You have more staff now.

703
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,970
I guess Ms. Choi In Kyung has
decided not to acknowledge me?

704
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:25,580
How can that be...
Hello, Assemblywoman.

705
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,690
Where is Assemblyman Jin?

706
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:30,580
He is going round and greeting other
assemblymen with Secretary General.

707
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,220
Being his next-door neighbor, I've come
to congratulate him on his move-in.

708
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,260
In Kyung, tell him
that I've dropped by.

709
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,820
Yes.

710
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,570
Work hard then.

711
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,990
Be careful on your way
back, Assemblywoman.

712
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,770
That girl is now blatantly
talking down to me.

713
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:57,170
So, you're saying you're an
assemblywoman and I'm an aide.

714
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,420
Oh my!

715
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,830
What is it?

716
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:07,030
Nothing. Nothing at all.

717
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,700
<i>Resume<br>Kim Gyu Hwan</i>

718
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,660
It's my aspiration to work at the
international organization in the future.

719
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,260
The reason I'm applying for the
internship at the National Assembly

720
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:28,540
is to gain necessary experience required
to work at the international organization.

721
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,410
An intern in the Assembly has to do
rough and tough jobs too at times.

722
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,470
Do you think you can stoop to
them with this kind of resume?

723
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,630
More important than the specs,

724
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,808
I think the important
thing is one's sense of

725
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,820
membership and character
as a team member.

726
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,870
I will think of it as a learning
opportunity and work hard.

727
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,690
I will let you know by tomorrow.
You can go.

728
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,870
- Thank you.<br>- Yep.

729
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,230
- What are you doing
here right now?<br>- Pardon?

730
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,530
I see that you didn't
pass the police exam.

731
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:04,230
But what are you doing here?

732
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,440
Am I not being interviewed
for an internship?

733
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,240
Why?

734
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:10,890
Pardon?

735
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,493
You failed the exam and
can't even see your

736
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,120
immediate future.<br>Since
I'm an aide here,

737
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,320
you want to somehow mooch
off of an acquaintance?

738
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,370
No!

739
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:28,330
No, I applied before you
became an aide here.

740
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,840
I was a bit surprised to see you too.

741
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:34,210
Okay, what made you apply?

742
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,160
Because I admire Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

743
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,880
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil stands for the
sufferings of the unemployed and...

744
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,430
Enough. You fail.

745
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:46,070
- What?<br>- Just leave.

746
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:48,160
What's the reason?

747
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,420
You are not a kid fit for
the National Assembly.

748
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,480
What do you know about me
to make that judgment?

749
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,960
The National Assembly is for
those interested in politics

750
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,640
or those ready to love.

751
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,360
At least you whom I know are not.

752
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,871
-CEO.<br>I'm telling you this
because I care about you.

753
01:00:05,883 --> 01:00:07,980
Stop this foolishness and
retry to make the police.

754
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,430
Leave.

755
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,150
Assemblyman.

756
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:23,480
Oh, you were in the middle
of an interview? I'm sorry.

757
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,530
Don't you know me?

758
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:42,160
No... it's my first time meeting you.

759
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,520
<i>Even if just once, that damned layoff...</i>

760
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,490
<i>Getting that done to us
is our wish come true.</i>

761
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,820
Did he pass?

762
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:56,030
No, he was rejected.

763
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,630
Why? What's the problem?

764
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,460
Not so much a problem, but...

765
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,640
If not that, then let's pick him.

766
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:04,460
Assemblyman.

767
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,280
This guy's wish is to get fired.

768
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,318
Let's slave drive him
to death and the moment

769
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:12,290
he makes a mistake, let's
just fire his ass.

770
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:14,040
What?

771
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:17,150
Here.

772
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,160
<i>Father, this person... I'll end him.</i>

773
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,160
<i>Watch me.</i>

774
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:41,540
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

775
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,540
<i>Assembly<br>Preview</i>

776
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,310
No one here in Yeouido is expecting
anything from Assemblyman Jin.

777
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:59,510
Hey, Jin Sang Pil, don't
be a scaredy-cat, punk!

778
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,030
Those of the steely nerves
are not the only brave ones.

779
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,610
The ignorant tends to be brave.

780
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:07,830
Are they asking the assemblyman
to lead this inquiry?

781
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,950
He was nudging a public
servant with something.

782
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:14,740
The only person who can make me into a
proper national assemblyman is Aide Choi.

783
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,210
Haven't I told you what is the best
to be done for Assemblyman Jin?

784
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:21,690
What should I do with an assemblyman whose
lips are effectively glued together?

785
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,500
Do I look so laughable to you?!
