00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,551
<i>All characters, party
names, and incidents</i>

2
00:00:04,563 --> 00:00:06,400
<i>appearing in this drama
are fictitious creations.</i>

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,650
Assemblyman Jin.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,640
How's the opposition party reacting?
Did it come out?

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,383
Just a while ago the Korean
Democratic and the Socialist.

6
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:21,440
Parties' floor leaders announced
mutual opposition to the veto.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,440
A spokesperson for the
Assembly Speaker said that

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,086
the Speaker expressed
regret toward Park Choon.

9
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:26,650
Seop's announcement at
the press conference.

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,940
What about the Blue House? Are
they not saying anything?

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,310
The President is presiding over a
cabinet meeting on the issue right now.

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,730
What?

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,020
What happens if the
President vetoes the bill?

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,730
Bae Dal Soo's bill will return to the Assembly.
<i>Last Episode.</i>

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,928
When the National Assembly
votes on it again, it must

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,150
absolutely affirm the resolution
according to the law.

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,100
So what's the big deal, it
can always be passed again!

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,480
Aigoo, really.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,960
Why are you guys
acting like that?

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,220
If it passed once, is there a law
that says it can't be passed twice?

21
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,390
Secretary Byeon, if the
vetoed bill is passed again,

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,200
two-thirds of the
assemblymen have to agree.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,310
Two-thirds?

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,270
Two hundred of them
have to agree.

25
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,310
THERE IS ONE WAY: The Blue
House not rejecting it.

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,304
The Bae Dal Soo bill is a bill
which passed the National.

27
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:20,270
Assembly with the unconditional
support of the citizens.

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,040
All we have to do is to execute the bill.
Just executing it.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,730
If by a tiny chance
the bill is vetoed

30
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,400
this act by the administration
will foolishly repudiate

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,310
the people's objective and the Assembly's
authority with a slap in the face.

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:43,060
Aide-nim Choi... the bill is
not going to be vetoed, is it?

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,710
<i>I don't like the bill Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil is pursuing.</i>

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,600
<i>I am earnestly appealing
to President Seo Dae Han.</i>

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,450
It will be fine. Let
us believe that.

36
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,520
I know. Yes. I know the economy
is facing hard times now.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,600
But the Bae Dal Soo bill is not
a law to destroy the economy.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,100
Because it will give hope to people
and make them work diligently again,

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,960
it is a law to
revive the economy.

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,980
Mr. President...

41
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,570
I earnestly appeal to you again.

42
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,350
I earnestly beg you.

43
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,600
Please don't veto it.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,160
Mr. President... it's
wrong to veto the bill.

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,810
I earnestly appeal to you again.
I earnestly beg of you.

46
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,160
Do not veto the bill.

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,700
Anyway, if the rejection
process doesn't go well,

48
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,850
our situation will become dire.

49
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,980
Assemblyman Baek, did
you hear anything?

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,940
I don't know, because I don't have
much interest in this matter.

51
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:00,140
And from now on, I hope you won't
use me for your press conferences.

52
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,650
What is this?

53
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,640
Who do you think you are that
you come in here as you please?

54
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,600
What is the matter?

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,480
Park Choon Seop, do you
really have to go this far?

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,370
You? How dare you call
the party head, "You"?

57
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,840
Watch what you say!

58
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,610
How can we call a person the party head
when he requests a veto from the President?

59
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,100
The person who is the representative
of the parliamentary majority!

60
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,419
Can you ask to veto
the law passed by the.

61
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:38,150
National Assembly and
supported by the citizens?!

62
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,670
Are you even the representative
of the citizens?!

63
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,420
But this bastard is really
asking to be kicked out!!

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,190
Stop!!

65
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,850
Assemblyman Jim... Sit there.

66
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,350
I will just ask you one thing.

67
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,620
If you possibly know, please
tell me what the VIP intends.

68
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,550
As you already know it, nowadays
I am not in contact with him.

69
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,550
Assemblyman Baek, aren't
you ashamed of yourself?

70
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,700
Why are you saying
that, Secretary Kim?

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,100
Before the people and
before my father,

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,400
aren't you ashamed of yourself?

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,400
Assemblyman Jin.

74
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,610
At the drop of a hat, going off about
the representative of the citizens...

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,270
Who exactly are the citizens
whom you represent for?

76
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,210
What?

77
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,050
The citizens whom I, Park
Choon Seop represent for,

78
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,500
are not peope who want a second chance
or a chance to revive from the loss

79
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,350
but people who are
fighting tenaciously

80
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,230
to gain that.

81
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,100
Out of the blood, sweat and
effort of such people,

82
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,250
out the ashes of war, today's
Republic of Korea was created.

83
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,650
The Bae Dal Soo law...

84
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,580
is just a drug which would

85
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,940
make such the great people weak.

86
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,860
You got it?

87
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,510
Those great citizens...

88
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,560
Do you even know how they live?

89
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,980
The great citizens that I know

90
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,600
do not expect those things.

91
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,060
They just want to be happy.

92
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,310
Not getting fired
from their jobs.

93
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,020
Having a store that
does not become ruined.

94
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,650
Raising their children properly.

95
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,355
Those children's getting a job and buying
their parents undergarments. Those

96
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,210
kinds of things. <br><i>(TRADITIONAL GIFT TO
PARENTS BOUGHT WITH FIRST PAYCHECK.)</i>

97
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,480
Do you know?

98
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,900
Hello?

99
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,920
Yeah, what happened
at the meeting?

100
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,150
I got it.

101
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,400
What happened?

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,690
Assemblyman Park.

103
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,160
It has been vetoed.

104
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,380
<i>President Seo Dae Han has
vetoed the Bae Dal Soo bill</i>

105
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,600
<i>which was approved by
the Assembly last week.</i>

106
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,279
<i>While saying that the bill is
contrary to the government's</i>

107
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,810
<i>economic reforms such as the
bill before the Assembly</i>

108
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,111
<i>to reform pensions and
he feared it would</i>

109
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,560
<i>heighten instability in
the nation's finances,</i>

110
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,160
<i>President Seo requested a
review in the Assembly.</i>

111
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,992
<i>Meanwhile, Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil, who led the.</i>

112
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:23,500
<i>Bae Dal Soo bill,
launched a counterattack.</i>

113
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,610
<i>The Bae Dal Soo Bill.</i>

114
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,040
<i>I will somehow make sure that the bill is
approved again in the plenary session.</i>

115
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,700
<i>Keep watching us.</i>

116
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,600
The President shouldn't
do this kind of thing.

117
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,600
What the heck does he think
the legislative branch is...

118
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,555
Mr. Speaker, can you please
open the pleanary session

119
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,720
to put the Bae Dal Soo bill
up for reconsideration?

120
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,310
I suggest you just sit on it.

121
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,270
Why?

122
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,900
If 2/3 of the assemblymen
do not agree,

123
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,970
it will become
like toilet paper.

124
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,660
You know the likelihood
of being passed is zero.

125
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,953
Mr Speaker, whether it takes
2/3 or 3/3 of assemblymen

126
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:15,850
to agree, I have to make
it pass no matter what.

127
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,520
It's a problem that should
not be seen so simply.

128
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,430
If it is rejected after
reconsideration,

129
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,460
what will become of the
authority of the Assembly?

130
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,920
In the end, it'll result in only giving a
justification to BH that exercised the veto

131
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,890
I don't know much about such a
complicated thing, Mr. Speaker.

132
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,700
The Bae Dal Soo bill
must be reconsidered.

133
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,640
Mr. Speaker, please help.

134
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,050
This is not the problem that the
speaker can make the decision alone.

135
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,940
Between two negotiating parties, the Goomin
party will not change their mind at all.

136
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,050
If a request comes from the
Korean Democratic Party,

137
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,480
then, I'll think about it.

138
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,650
Oh, don't worry about that.

139
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,900
Rather than Gookmin Party,
the Korean Democratic Party

140
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,020
likes me more.

141
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,720
The floor leader and the leader of Policy
Planning Committee, both are not answering.

142
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,310
<i>Representative Oh Sae Chang.</i>

143
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,090
Why is the Korean Democratic
Party suddenly acting this way?

144
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,810
A little while ago, they did make a
strong statement of criticizing BH.

145
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,640
They just cursed BH loudly but they said
nothing about their future intentions.

146
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,270
It seems like they
want to back track.

147
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,490
Why would they back track?

148
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,900
Stop joking around.

149
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,310
Isn't that true, Aide Choi?

150
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,920
What Assemblywoman Hong
said is probably correct.

151
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,653
They probably feel burdened
because they think

152
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:52,410
it won't be passed although
it is reconsidered,

153
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,100
They didn't even try,
so how would they know?

154
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,215
I don't think so. They
probably put their phones

155
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,440
somewhere strange. That's
why they can't answer it.

156
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,000
If I keep trying,
they'll answer.

157
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,080
No, I ought to text instead.
Text message.

158
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,840
Assemblyman.

159
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,060
Why are you doing that?

160
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,100
Why are you suddenly making a serious face?
It scares me. What happened again?

161
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,200
Bae Dal Soo's bill seems to
have gone as far as it could.

162
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,580
When you are
re-elected next year,

163
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,320
Pursue it again at that time.

164
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,880
What are you talking
about right now?

165
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,184
Aide Choi, you've lost a
lot of your confidence.

166
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:49,700
What next year? We
have to do it now.

167
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,067
Don't you know the saying
that one must not put

168
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,160
off until tomorrow what
you must do today?

169
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,520
What Choi In Kyung is
saying is correct.

170
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,120
We now have no other way.

171
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,150
Why? Why is there no other way?
Why are you all doing like this?

172
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,820
Why not? It was passed
by the Assembly.

173
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,620
The Assembly is where to make a law.
That's why we made that law.

174
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,480
And it was passed.

175
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,440
What are you talking
"to give it up here"?!

176
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,540
This place is the Assembly.
Is BH the Assembly?

177
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,640
It doesn't make a sense,
right, Aide Choi?

178
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
I am sorry.

179
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,700
Bae Dal Soo's bill...

180
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,660
We made it!

181
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,760
We!

182
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,220
Assemblymen made it!!

184
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,070
Don't be too disappointed. You
did everything you could.

185
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,590
Dal Soo will appreciate
your effort, too.

186
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,020
Yes, Chief Secretary.

187
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,320
Tomorrow, you have
to come to the BH.

188
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,860
Are you trying to
convince the Assemblyman?

189
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,180
It means that we want to see
you and not Assemblyman Jin.

190
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,640
What?

191
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:49,270
<i>Blue House.</i>

192
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,800
<i>The VIP wants to keep
you close to him.</i>

193
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,540
<i>Accept the Senior. Secretary Position
in the Office of Political Affairs.</i>

194
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,800
<i>Bae Dal Soo.</i>

195
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,400
You suffered a lot.

196
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,080
The bearer bonds I talked to you about.
What happened to them?

197
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,220
Take care of your family
with this for now.

198
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,100
I asked, what happened
to the bearer bonds?

199
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,480
Just be happy that you were
released on probation.

200
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,300
I'll look for a good place for you
to work at an appropriate time.

201
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
Secretary General!

202
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,660
Chief Aide Im. My
patience has worn out.

203
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,200
Don't provoke me any further.

204
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,080
Do you think such threat
would work on me?

205
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,460
Take a good look at me.

206
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,800
Do I seem like the Baek
Do Hyeon that you served?

207
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,460
Don't piss me off anymore.

208
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,480
<i>Before the citizens
and before my father,</i>

209
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,580
<i>aren't you ashamed of yourself?</i>

210
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,040
<i>Assemblyman, you have a
request for a meeting.</i>

211
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,840
Who is it?

212
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,380
What is it that you want?

213
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:13,900
The Bae Dal Soo legislation. Please
help so it can be reconsidered.

214
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,738
You have the ability to
make it happen. If you

215
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,600
help me, you can not only
get it re-introduced,

216
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,160
but even get it passed.

217
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,560
Do I have reason to?

218
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,160
Yes, there is.

219
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:38,320
If you help me this once, I will not run
in Gyeonje City District next election.

220
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,000
What did you say?<br>-If
it's like that,

221
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,760
it's enough of a
reason to help me.

222
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,640
Do you know what I
regret the most?

223
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,020
What is it?

224
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,910
Recommending you for the
strategic nomination.

225
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,420
I beg you.. Let me finish
this with my own hands.

226
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,760
Run. Do everything you can
to run for the election.

227
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm going to stomp you.

228
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,980
When Aide Choi came to
me to become my aide,

229
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,720
she told me this.

230
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,040
That politics was created

231
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,550
to save the hellish
world by human power,

232
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,160
not by divine power.

233
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,390
So?

234
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:07,180
You, too... save yourself.

235
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,630
I'll leave now.

236
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,620
Choi In Kyung...

237
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,090
Let her go now.

238
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,540
What do you mean?

239
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,614
The elder proposed the position
of Senior Secretary to

240
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:28,600
the President for Political
Affairs to Choi In Kyung.

241
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,740
Are you talking about
the Blue House?

242
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:39,100
But I hear that that foolish
person declined it.

243
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,720
So that Choi In Kyung
can achieve her dream,

244
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,280
let her go now.

245
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,960
This is why I can't leave
the office at any time.

246
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,760
Isn't it the most basic rule for you to
be aware of where the Assemblyman is?

247
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,860
Why do all of you look so depressed?
Did the sky fall?

248
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,940
That's why, the more he's depressed,
the more we need to cheer up!

249
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,680
So he can get his passion back!

250
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,620
Assemblyman.

251
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,640
Just where were you,
without a cell phone?

252
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,580
We'll find a way to revive the Bae
Dal Soo legislation no matter what.

253
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,520
So don't lose heart too much.

254
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,160
Hey everybody! I have an
important announcement.

255
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,640
Aide Choi will
resign as of today.

256
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,020
Oh my, what's
he saying?<br>- What?

257
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,820
Now that I've been
vetoed or whatever,

258
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,480
I've realized that we should have a
branch inside the Blue House, too.

259
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:01,160
So she is being offered to the President
as the BH Secretary for Political Affairs.

260
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,820
Awesome.

261
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,900
Assemblyman.

262
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,300
Secretary Oh. Dismiss Aide Choi
from her post as of today.

263
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,420
Dis-... dismiss?

264
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,980
I don't know how
you found out but

265
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,560
just because you announce it to the
secretaries, do you think I'll go?

266
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,440
Just go now. You have
to go and do big work.

267
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,101
Is there any other bigger
thing than being an.

268
00:20:26,113 --> 00:20:27,640
Aide to the Indifferent
BH faction leader?

269
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,120
I am not going.<br>-Aide Choi.

270
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,220
I know you are doing this so
that I can wear the badge.

271
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,450
Yes, I am going to
wear the badge.

272
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:43,080
I will wear it but not by the President's
backing but by your backing.

273
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,300
By my backing?

274
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,518
Of course. Next year I will make you
re-elected. After that, the 3rd

275
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,480
term Assemblyman, the leader of
the party, and up to President!

276
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,229
For all that, am I crazy
to go to the unpopular.

277
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:57,600
President, whose
remaining term is short?

278
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:05,000
Therefore, don't say those
words again in the future.

279
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,620
Aide Choi, you don't have
anything to do here.

280
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,080
Why do I have nothing to do?

281
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,020
Did I tell you I would make the
action plan for Bae Dal Soo's bill?

282
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,440
Don't you trust me?

283
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,520
I trust you. How many times
did I tell you that?

284
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,780
Still, you don't have
anything to do now.

285
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,597
You don't know how much
the secretaries have

286
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,060
to do. That's why you
keep saying that.

287
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,700
Don't be so stubborn. Call quickly!
Quickly!

288
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,360
No. I will send a letter by registered
mail that says I am not going.

289
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,920
That's enough. Please go!

290
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,980
No. I don't like it.

291
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,580
What kind of aide doesn't listen to
the assemblyman's words like this?

292
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,660
Go quickly! Go quickly! Go!

293
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,220
No matter how hard you try,

294
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:56,180
I'm stuck to you like chewing gum
and won't separate from you.

295
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:08,560
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

296
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,110
You are here?

297
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,040
How are you?

298
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,740
I heard from Secretary Sim;
Did you get a call from BH?

299
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,620
This Sim Dong Cheon...

300
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,620
By the way, Aren't
you really going?

301
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,220
Why am I going there?

302
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,988
Is it more strange that you
are not going? That is

303
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,780
the position that everybody
else is anxious to get.

304
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,700
Assemblywoman Hong. I will go to
the end with our Assemblyman.

305
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,980
He was right.<br>-Pardon?

306
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,924
Someone said that Choi
In Kyung is the only

307
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:51,160
person for whom the word
comrade is appropriate.

308
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,640
I admit it.

309
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,480
Who is the someone?

310
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:01,060
The person who can die for Choi In Kyung
more than Assemblyman Jin... Baek Do Hyeon.

311
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,420
Anyhow, Choi Doube-O, you
sometimes look cool.

312
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,920
Is it because you are older
than me by one year?

313
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,960
Is it proper manners that you address
a year older person <br>as Choi Double-O?

314
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,000
Just bear a little bit more.

315
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,680
After taking the badge off,
I will call you "Unni."

316
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Unni?

317
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,720
Since I don't have many friends, I try to
be a friend. But you said you are older.

318
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,600
I can't help it.

319
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,180
Assemblywoman Hong.

320
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,540
It hurts.

321
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,140
I am strong, ain't I?

322
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,340
Say to give a punch.

323
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,700
Say honestly. It's a little regrettable
not to go to the BH, isn't it?

324
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,720
Kind of... A little...

325
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,980
Yes, So Min. Why?

326
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,440
Assemblyman looks strange.

327
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,860
What do you mean <i>strange?</i>

328
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,360
He went to the press conference.

329
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,540
All of sudden, he said to
us "Sorry" then he left.

330
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,560
What?

331
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,140
<i>What happened?</i>

332
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,000
As an Assemblyman who
leads Bae Dal Soo's bill,

333
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,560
I can't acknowlege this
reality at all, that.

334
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,080
Bae Dal Soo's bill
was vetoed and

335
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:36,500
can't be reconsidered
in the Assembly.

336
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,760
I got to know that the Assembly
is where the laws are made.

337
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,380
And the Assemblymen are the
people who make the laws.

338
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,320
If the law we make
with difficulty

339
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,330
becomes trash easily,

340
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,540
we should not be
the Assemblymen.

341
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,500
That's why I...

342
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,140
will resign

343
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,640
from the position of Assemblyman

344
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,280
at the end of this week.

345
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,200
Oh my god.

346
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,373
And I beg my last favor to the
leaders of the negotiation

347
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:24,420
groups from the ruling party
and the opposition party.

348
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,680
My last favor, only one favor.

349
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,420
Within this week,

350
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,240
please reconsider Bae Dal
Soo's bill in the Assembly,

351
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,440
whether it will be
passed or rejected.

352
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:50,000
Please allow me to cast my last
vote in favor with my own hand.

353
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,200
This is my last favor to
ask as the Assemblyman,

354
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,580
and my wish.

355
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,460
Wow, Is Jin Sang Pil a
suicide blackmailer?

356
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,080
How can he quit the position of Assembly
because of not reconsidering his bill?

357
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,160
How is the reaction
of the press?

358
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,660
Right now, it is fussing.

359
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,840
Not only one or two articles appeared,
saying to reconsider Bae Dal Soo's bill.

360
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,600
Chairman, let's reconsider it.

361
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,440
Anyhow, it will be rejected.

362
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,260
Assemblyman Baek, please work
hard this time, too.<br>-Pardon?

363
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,440
I ask you to do the press conference
in opposition to reconsideration.

364
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,080
I clearly told you that I am
not interested in this matter.

365
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,840
This is not asking,

366
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,880
but ordering it as a leader of
Emergency Measure Committee.

367
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,800
Assemblyman Park.<br>- Do it.

368
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,153
Both of Bae Dal Soo's
bill and Jin Sang Pil are

369
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:00,180
from the seeds that
Assemblyman Baek sowed.

370
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,280
Let's stay low for a moment.

371
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,320
It is irrational to challenge Park Choon
Seop before being reconciled with the VIP.

372
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,489
That's enough.<br>- There
is still some suspicion

373
00:27:11,501 --> 00:27:13,220
left in the Chief
Secretary Lim's case...

374
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,780
Please Stop it!

375
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,840
Hey.<br>-Please!

376
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,160
Let's stop it!

377
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,000
Do whatever you want.

378
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,320
<i>Lim Gyu Tae</i><br><i>I already spent all
the living expense you gave.</i>

379
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,420
<i>Prepare five big denomination
bonds as I requested.</i>

380
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,480
<i>If not, your political
life will be over.</i>

381
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,386
Even though the bill can be
reconsidered, the number of the

382
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:05,260
opposiition party members are not
enough to bring it to a vote.

383
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,360
We need at least 151
assemblymen to attend to vote.

384
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,103
There are only 150 seats even
if all of our opposition

385
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:15,520
party members and
Indifferent-BH members attend.

386
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,080
This means, if there is one
more member, we can vote.

387
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,040
But, who will come into line
with you from the Gookmin Party?

388
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,440
For a moment, excuse me.

389
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,180
<i>Joo Hee's mom.</i>

390
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
Wait.

391
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,860
Honey, when you quit the assembly,
what are you going to do?

392
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:54,700
There is an ironwork place that Hyung
Seong Gi saw in Kyeongje City.

393
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,820
We want to work there together.

394
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,820
That's good. You are
very good at welding.

395
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,260
You did Assemblyman better.

396
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,080
If you go to Gyeongje City,

397
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,060
Joo Hee and I will follow you.

398
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,540
Kyung Ah.<br>- If you
are okay with me,

399
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,240
let's start again.

400
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,940
Mom, Dad! We have a camera.

401
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,140
Mom, Dad, let's have
a picture taken.

402
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,380
Gyu Hwan. Come here. Let's
have picture taken together.

403
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,380
Oppa, come here. Let's have
picture taken together.

404
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,780
So that Bae Dal Soo's Law
can pass, please help.

405
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:20,690
It will be better for you to go
and prepare to go to the BH.

406
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,330
No. Unless the Bae Dal
Soo's Law passes,

407
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,020
I will not be going to the BH.

408
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:35,730
I can cope with Baek Do Hyeon
as a corrupt politician but

409
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,800
I am not confident I can handle the failure
of a politician named Jin Sang Pil.

410
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,080
It sounds like you want
to leave politics.

411
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:57,520
Even for your sake, the Bae
Dal Soo bill must be passed.

412
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,970
Why is that?

413
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,100
It is the second chance
for Baek Do Yeon

414
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,510
to be reborn as a human being
out of the power from slavery.

415
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:24,030
Choi In Kyung, I will not live as a person
without power but as a slave who has power.

416
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,790
Now, please go.

417
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,203
To Assemblyman Baek, .. even
though you disappointed

418
00:31:32,215 --> 00:31:35,300
me a lot, I can still
say there is one thing

419
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,900
that I am sincerely
thankful for.

420
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
What is that?

421
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,500
You asked me to serve as
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's aide.

422
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,960
Thanks to that,

423
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,590
I, who had been a trivial
political engineer,

424
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:15,160
I got to taste the
real joy in politics.

425
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,860
Then...

426
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,480
It's Baek Do Hyeon.

427
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,650
I won't wait any longer.

428
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,660
State your opposition at the
press conference this morning.

429
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,830
Aren't you going to be
in Yeoido next year?

430
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,160
I understand.

431
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,070
You thought well. Bye.

432
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:30,000
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

433
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,250
<i>I am Baek Do Hyeon from the Gookmin
Emergency Response Council.</i>

434
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,380
The Bae Dal Soo bill...

435
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,700
should immediately be re-presented
in the plenary session.

436
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,230
With the assemblymen who agree
with me from the Gookmin Party,

437
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,650
I reiterate that I will vote in
favor of the Bae Dal Soo's Law.

438
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,690
<i>Until recently I opposed the law</i>

439
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,550
<i>so I suspect many of
you are puzzled about</i>

440
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,640
<i>today's explanation
of my position.</i>

441
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,940
<i>Citizens.</i>

442
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,240
<i>Until now, I deceived
the citizens</i>

443
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,030
<i>and I deceived myself.</i>

444
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:21,690
<i>I am resigning from all positions
including the emergency council.</i>

445
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,670
<i>Also, I will not run in
next year's election.</i>

446
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,452
<i>Also with regards to Im Gyu
Tae, I will turn myself</i>

447
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:31,990
<i>into the Prosecutor and
reveal the entire truth</i>

448
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,330
<i>about the matters alleged
in the pending court case.</i>

449
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,780
I've become a
completely new bird.

450
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:51,200
Citizens. Until now, I have
been there in this place...

451
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,980
Assembly.

452
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,000
I lived oblivious
of the fact that

453
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,000
this is the place where the
representatives <br>of the people assemble.

454
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,940
To Bae Dal Soo's law that reminded me
of my original intention of politics

455
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,320
and those who led the
struggle for the law,

456
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,000
I express my deep appreciation.

457
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,810
Baek Do Hyeong... has
completely self-destructed.

458
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,100
Issue a mobilization
order for all members.

459
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,760
If he does that,

460
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,350
Bae Dal Soo's Law can
be reconsidered?

461
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,490
Yes.

462
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,690
Of course, it will
be reconsidered.

463
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,000
Now it looks like there is a possibility
the Bae Dal Soo law <br>will be enacted.

464
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,220
Assemblyman, the members of the
Jinjimo <br>have come to cheer you on.

465
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,730
Oh, is that so?

466
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,470
Assemblyman Jin! Hurry
up and go outside.

467
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,600
Why? What is the matter?

468
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,050
But, you guys...

469
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,990
How did you guys...

470
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,780
- Assemblyman Jin. <br>
- Hyung Sang Pil.

471
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,425
I'm sorry. Not
understanding what your

472
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:58,640
intentions were, I just cursed you.
Forgive me.

473
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,360
Before you resign, I thought I
really had to apologize to you.

474
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,650
I am sorry for all this time.

475
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,570
What are you saying?... I'm
the one who is sorry...

476
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,970
Assemblyman Jin...
I am so sorry.

477
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:18,370
Forgive me.<br>-Hyung Sang
Phil.<br>- You came well.

478
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,530
I am really grateful.

479
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:28,840
Someone said this. If one person
dreams, it is just a dream, but

480
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,530
when more than one dreams
together, it becomes reality.

481
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,700
All of us together,
going forward together,

482
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,130
let us dream

483
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,960
the Bae Dal Soo law together.

484
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,570
Jang Pil. You are our hyung.

485
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,230
Chairnan, there isn't a
thing to worry about.

486
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,710
Even if the sky is split into two
pieces, the bill will be rejected.

487
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,530
Why hasn't Jin
Sang Pil appeared?

488
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,540
Did he already come in?

489
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,390
He's arrived.

490
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,190
What is that? He tries to threaten someone?
Why does he bring so many?

491
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,010
I'll be back.

492
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,780
Let's go.

493
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,230
Will the house come
to order please?

494
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:36,120
The bill to provide support for a second
chance to the bankrupt and the unemployed

495
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,420
which was submitted to the President is
being introduced for reconsideration.

496
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,410
Because there has been a request
for debate on the issue

497
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,740
we will start the debate now.

498
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,800
Assemblyman Park Choon Seop,
you may give your statement.

499
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,510
I am Park Cheoon Seop.

500
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:18,760
There are people saying that
the president's veto was

501
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,280
an infringement of the
Assembly's authority.

502
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,800
The veto is a legitimate right granted
to the President by the Constitution.

503
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,557
The government is a guard
protecting the lives and property

504
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:38,150
of the nation's people, not a
lending institution banker.

505
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,040
If there are many people who, blaming
their own failure on the government,

506
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,878
come to the government
begging for favors under

507
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:46,470
the speciously named
second chance law...

508
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:50,890
if many people ask for favors
from the government...

509
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,180
I guarantee this country
will have no future.

510
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,650
I, Park Choon Seop, with the
blood drained from my heart,

511
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,940
beg my fellow assemblyman.

512
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,800
Today... make this the memorial service
day for laws based on emotion...

513
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:15,550
thank for your attention.

514
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,920
Assemblyman Park Choon
Seop is in a big rush...

515
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,630
He has personally stepped forward<br>to
launch a pre-emptive strike.

516
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:27,370
Yes, the Gookmin party members
are wrung out and drained.

517
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,890
<i>Next, Assemblyman
Jin, please speak.</i>

518
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,590
Okay.

519
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,130
Yes, I'm Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil.

520
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:25,690
Looking at your expression, it
seems like you are rather anxious.

521
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,580
You don't need to do that, Assemblymen.
Don't get anxious.

522
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:35,490
The person we fear is
not the President,

523
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:39,570
nor Party Leader, but the citizen.
Citizen.

524
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,850
Just say what you
have to say quickly.

525
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,450
Shut your mouth and
listen to him.

526
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,740
Assemblywoman Cheon,
stop butting in.

527
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,339
Chairman. Please apply a
proper sanction against

528
00:42:47,351 --> 00:42:49,430
the Assemblyman who
is picking a fight.

529
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,920
Here. Here. All of you be quiet.

530
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,330
Assemblyman Jin,
please continue.

531
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,070
Okay.

532
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,580
Before I speak,

533
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,480
just as I promised last time,

534
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,040
when this session ends,

535
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,350
my position as an Assemblyman:

536
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,970
I will resign from it.

537
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,190
I will keep my promise.

539
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,940
Do not lower your head.
As his secretary,

540
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,710
let's stand with our chests
high and see what happens.

541
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:54,670
Through some process, I did
become an Assemblyman but

542
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:00,250
as you know, I was a welder.

543
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,270
I really like welding.

544
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,150
The reason is that

545
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,680
welding puts things together.
Whatever the kind of metals,

546
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,040
we melt them and
put them together.

547
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,990
I would like it if
politics was like welding.

548
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:27,160
Bind Kyeongsangdo and Jeollado together.
Bind the rich with the poor.

549
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,370
And bind the winners and losers.

550
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,790
Binding them together,

551
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:39,820
creating that kind of a country,

552
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,570
I wish politics would do that.

553
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,720
In regard to Bae Dal Soo's Law,

554
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,770
I believe it is that
kind of politics.

555
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,366
Assemblyman Park Choon Soep,
a little while ago, you

556
00:44:55,378 --> 00:44:58,020
said the government is not
a banker, didn't you?

557
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,620
Then, what about the citizens?

558
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:08,220
The citizens are the financial bankers?
Are they the financial bankers?

559
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,560
You see, our citizens work
themselves to the bone.

560
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,020
They keep our country.

561
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,750
And they pay taxes. That is

562
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:25,370
because the law says
that it is their duty.

563
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,780
Bae Dal Soo was like that.

564
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:34,600
All his life, he worked hard to build
ships, went to serve in the military,

565
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,770
and he paid his taxes without missing
a beat. However, suddenly one day,

566
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,920
he was thrown out
onto the street.

567
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,570
Who is going to help
him get up again?

568
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,450
Who is going to help
him rise again?!

569
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,130
It's the government!
The government!

570
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,960
To make the citizens happy
is the government's duty.

571
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,460
The citizens are not pushovers
nor financial bankers.

572
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,740
The citizens are the
owners of this country.

573
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,980
That's why I...

574
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,750
want the citizens to believe

575
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:29,860
that the government
never abandons them.

576
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,790
"Even though I fall down,

577
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:38,150
the government gives a helping
hand to make me get up again."

578
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:42,790
So, I... I...

579
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:48,730
in this proud Korea, I...

580
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:56,180
I will become happy
in the future.

581
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:04,100
I, the leader of Indifferent-to
BH, Jin Sang Pil,

582
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,650
JSP, am clearly saying...

583
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:13,540
If the citizens do
all of their duties,

584
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:19,030
the government has
to do its duty and

585
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:24,580
the citizens have to
demand their rights.

586
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:51,400
Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!
Jin Sang Pil!

587
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:28,420
Now we conclude the debates and
start voting on this matter.

588
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:39,420

Aide Choi asks you
to come quickly.

591
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,520
She is very upset. Stop
doing this and go quickly.

00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,716
Noona Ae Ri, fire Hyung Seong
Gi and hire someone else.

all of them are inferior.

Hey. I am the boss, you punk!

595
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,420
The boss is higher or the
boss's wife is higher?

596
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,670
The boss's wife.

597
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,180

You are still milking it.
I did this you know.

615
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:27,060
I don't think is going to do. You are going
to become unemployed like Assemblyman Jo.

617
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,980

to do it or not?

00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,870
I stayed up all for days so my
throat isn't all that good and...

619
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,320
I had decided not to do anymore
political campaigning.

620
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,780
Why did you use a picture like this?
Should have used a good one.

621
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,740
Who picked the picture?

622
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,920
This looks good.

623
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:58,510
If I could tell you about
candidate ♪1, Choi In Kyeong,

624
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,010
Yes.

625
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:05,600
She gained a lot of experience from
the Assembly to the Blue House.

626
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:10,480
And the best point about
her is that she's smart.

627
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,000
Although in the picture she
came out a bit prickly,

628
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,230
in truth, her personality
is soft as a silk.

629
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:22,850
I know this because I personally
experienced. But because she nags a bit,

630
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:27,380
it can be tough. But because she
has so many good points about her,

631
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:33,490
I am completely certain that
candidate ♪1, Choi In Kyeong

632
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:38,580
is the fittest Assemblywoman

no fun if I talk about

only politics and sing
the candidate's praise.

Assemblyman.

679
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,380
I knew it. From the first
day, you look like a novice.

680
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:19,320
A novice? Why? Do I look strange somehow?

681
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,280
Do you want to enter
without wearing a badge?

682
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,560
Omo. I forgot about it.

683
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,748
As a secretary, what did you
do without taking care of this

684
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,240
kind of thing? You'd better start
working as an intern again.

685
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,970
Huh. You told me to keep quiet
because you would take care of it.

686
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:37,870
When did I say that? You are a strange guy.
That's enough. Be quiet.

687
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,810
Give it to me. I am late.

688
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:42,720
Wait for a moment, please.

689
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,550
For this kind of stuff...
Sunbae has to... like this.

690
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,530
Ahh. It's good.

691
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,200
Congratulations,
Assemblywoman Choi In Kyung.

692
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,760
2nd Leader of Indifferent-to-BH, fighting!

693
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,650
No matter what, make many
members of Indifferent-to BH.

694
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,600
Yes.

695
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,540
Assemblyman. I think I am a little nervous.

696
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,540
Are you scared?

697
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,660
It seems like that.

698
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,670
Ahh... Why are you scared?
All of the people here

699
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:29,440
are your comrades. Am I right?

700
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,460
Enter now.

701
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,350
Yes.

702
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,030
Aide Choi.

703
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,480
Do well.
