3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,440
- What is this?<br>- It's a list of 28
incumbent Gookmin Party assemblymen.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,640
-So?<br>-Most are too old, or with
bad legislative track records,

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,900
or with previous corruption records.
By looking at

6
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:22,140
the list, I am pretty sure
that it's a "hit list".

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,160
A hit list?

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,320
It's a list of people who won't be
getting the nomination next election.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,300
Probably due to someone's mistake,
I think the list was leaked.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,700
But your name is also on it.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,660

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,560
Absolutely.

17
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,280
Aide Choi, what are you
doing there by yourself?

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,650
Come out here and look!

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,280
Yes, Assemblyman.

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,440
What Aide Seo said about
this, is it for real?

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,560
Is it really a hit list?

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,500
It's too early to
make that conclusion.

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,120
It could be a document that idle
aides or reporters made for fun.

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,020
Right? Huh? This
isn't it, right?

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,220
This... this is a fake.

26
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,920
If this is really the hit list, then
it was made by Secretary General Baek.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
Right?

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,770
But my name shouldn't be here.

29
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,120
My name being here doesn't
make any sense, right?

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,760
Ah, yes.

31
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,720
That makes sense too.

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,660
That is what I'm saying, right?

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,620
Where did you pick this up to disturb
me at the beginning of the day?

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,700
Why are you doing this? Huh?

35
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,700
Everyone, don't worry about
this and work, okay?

36
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,040
Where did you pick
up this trash...

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,980

<i>Assembly<br>~Episode 7~</i>

39
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,340
No matter how I look at it,
it seems for real.<br><i>Episode 7</i>

40
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,803
With the exception of our
old man, everyone is

41
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:17,080
just the perfect candidate
for replacement.

42
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,740
Aide Seo, why do you keep
saying that and worrying us?

43
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,035
I am a person who has
experienced no less than

44
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:25,060
5 general elections
in the Assembly Hall.

45
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,380
Do you think I've seen a hit list just
once or twice?<br>Who are you glaring at?

46
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,440
When I first saw it, I just
got that feeling right away.

47
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,520
- Aide Choi.<br>- Yes.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,240
Can't you find out if the
list is for real or not?

49
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,412
Whether it is in the
Blue House or in the

50
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:49,760
Party, there is no one
that you do not know.

51
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,960
I don't think it's a matter that even you,
Secretary Oh, should be concerned about.

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,200
Please just do your job well.

53
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,790
How can I work when I
can't focus on it?

54
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,780
Why do you worry
yourself needlessly?

55
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,780
If Aide Choi is that relaxed about it, this
is a fake, fake.<br>Don't concern yourself.

56
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,480
That is because Aide
Choi is out of it.

57
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,630
Hello, Assemblyman Park.

58
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,280
I really enjoyed looking at the
hit list with Jin Sang Pil on it.

59
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,500
Our Secretary General Baek, you
were a very decisive person!

60
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,740
I didn't know you would answer
me in such a firm manner.

61
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,840
I am sure I don't know what
you are talking about.

62
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,051
You can speak to me
honestly.<br>I'm not one

63
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,940
who secretively records
conversations.

64
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,466
At any rate, I trust that you will
gladly join the creation of a

65
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:02,860
new special committee to improve
the party nomination system.

66
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,839
Yes, of course. Print the
committee member appointment

67
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:08,080
certificates right now
and hand them out!

68
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes!

69
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,660
You have a meeting request from the
party members on the hit list.

70
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,260
If it's about that, there is
no reason I should see them.

71
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,860
Yes, I understand.

72
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,920
He's coming!

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,760
Secretary General, have you seen the member
list spreading in the Assembly Hall?

74
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,200
Yes, I have heard about it.

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,640
Some are suspecting
it to be a hit list.

76
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,787
Well, that doesn't
sound like the kind of

77
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:38,060
question I should be answering.
Yes, then...

78
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,640
- Secretary General!<br>-
Just one word, please!

79
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,020
The party's official briefing
will be given soon.<br>Please wait.

80
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,920
As stated thus far...

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,060
the mysterious list with the names of
28 incumbent Gookmin Party assemblymen

82
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,500
is nothing more than a mysterious
document with no known source or purpose.

83
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,280
Korean citizens, there is no such thing
as a hit list in our Gookmin Party.

84
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,792
A death note where the moment
one's name is written, the

85
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,300
person comes to an end --
this only exists in movies.

86
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,176
<i>... the moment one's name

88
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,000
What do you think about
my ad-lib, death note?

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,700
Good.

90
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,860
You're a genius when it comes to
paying perfunctory compliments.

91
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,840
Since I have done
the damage control,

92
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,900
please come clean with me.

93
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,880
About what?

94
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,980
That list... is the
hit list, right?

95
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,880
Assemblywoman Hong, there is a
saying that ignorance is bliss.

96
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,380
It's just that I'm curious...
How about...

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,160
each knowing just enough

98
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,220
to do their given job?

99
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,880
Secretary General, why such a
stern face at a mere joke?

100
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,180
Making me feel awkward...

101
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,380
Yes, In Kyung.

102
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,100
I would like to see you
briefly about that hit list.

103
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,955
But the party's official
comment about that has been

104
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,940
released already. That it is
just a mysterious document.

105
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,460
I know that list is
the real hit list.

106
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,480
I also know that you leaked it.

107
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,340
Why are you claiming
that list is a hit list?

108
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,572
Because the list of 28
circulating in the Assembly

109
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:46,520
Hall, with the exception
of Assemblyman Jin,

110
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,440
exactly coincides
with the document

111
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,860
of 27 party members unfit
for subsequent nominations

112
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,880
that you presented to the
Blue House late last year.

113
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,463
Right before leaving the Blue
House, my duties included working

114
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:02,620
for the (BH'S) secret network
regarding the legislature.

115
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,229
I even had access to some
classified documents

116
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,360
going directly to the
VIP (PRESIDENT).

117
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,280
The Elder has cared about you a lot since
the days of his presidential candidacy.

118
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,380
I forgot.

119
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,778
If Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's name had not been

120
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,300
there, I would have thought
that the BH leaked it.

121
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,260
But, as long as Assemblyman
Jin's name is added there,

122
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,160
it was you who
deliberately leaked it.

123
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,042
Assemblyman Park Choon Seob
came demanding omission of

124
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:33,000
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil from
the next nomination round.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,900
I couldn't give him
a written promise.

126
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,960
So I answered with the
hit list instead.

127
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,900
Answer, did you say?

128
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,037
The reason Assemblyman Jin
became the Anti-BH faction's

129
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,860
target was that he had
followed your instructions.

130
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,996
Casting away a person like
an old shoe after all his

131
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,440
purposes have been served... was
that your kind of politics?

132
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,280
In Kyung!

133
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,580
Jin Sang Pil... the moment
he was chosen by me,

134
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,000
he was doomed to be cast away.
You've known that too.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,828
Never even in my dream, did
I think that he would be

136
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,680
thrown away in this kind of
mean, underhanded manner!

137
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,675
Did you ask me to become
Assemblyman Jin's aide

138
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,380
so you could show me
this side of yourself?

139
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,400
Because at that time,

140
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,256
I didn't know that Assemblyman
Jin would so quickly

141
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:26,100
aim for a nomination for
the next general election.

142
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,964
The reason Assemblyman
Jin is overly obedient

143
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:33,840
to me... is probably
the party nomination.

144
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,885
If Assemblyman Jin really
wanted to do something

145
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:38,940
at least somewhat meaningful
as an assemblyman

146
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,480
he should not have had his
heart set on a nomination.

147
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,760
I heard you well.

148
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,500
I know it's very hard on you.

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,650
If it's too hard, it's
okay for you to quit now.

150
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,760
You did as much as you could.

151
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,720
Do you know what is
really hard for me?

152
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,320
That my admiration for you

153
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,180
is fading with each passing day.

154
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,960
At least the Baek Do
Hyeon whom I know...

155
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,500
ought not be this
kind of person.

<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

Why do you keep looking at it?

158
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,300
It just bothers me a little bit.

159
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,980
Aide Seo's words sound
right at times.

160
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,400
Aide Choi said it wasn't.

161
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,640
Don't pay attention to it.

162
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,500
Oh, right, Assemblyman!

163
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,480
A group called Gyeongjae City
Youth Volunteer Soldiers...

164
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,300
It's time for their field trip
to the National Assembly.

165
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,840
Youth Volunteer Soldiers?

166
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,380
Secretaries Kim and
Park are out there.

167
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,200
- Why don't you go and
say hello?<br>- Okay.

168
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,940
Oh, right, you know those balloons
we got last Children's Day?

169
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,140
The kids would love them
if we give those out.

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,540
The place where you are standing
right now is the Rotunda Hall.

171
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,780
The yellow in the middle of
the floor represents the sun.

172
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,540
And the 24 lines signify
sunrays and at the same time

173
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,460
that the lines
converge to be one.

174
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,420
Namely, they symbolize
the citizens' unity.

175
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,680
When assemblymen
only keep fighting,

176
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,260
how can the citizens unite?

177
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,720
You said they were youth
volunteer soldiers?

178
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,900
During the Korean War (OCCURRED
1950-1953), they were youth soldiers

179
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,740
who participated in the battle
to defend Gyeongjae City.

180
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,880
Why are you wearing
glasses, all of a sudden?

181
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,080
Oh, I wear them once in a while.

182
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,060
Hmm, you wear them
once in a while?

183
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,780
Now, we will go to see
the main assembly floor.

184
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,040
Shall we?

185
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,720
Look here, this balloon is
deflated.<br>Give me another one!

186
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,100
Me, too!

187
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,600
Line up, line up please!

188
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,540
Bon appétit!

189
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,060
Please move. It's hot.

190
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,420
It's good.

191
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,460
- Thank you!<br>- One
more egg for you.

192
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,500
Thank you!

193
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,020
- Have a lot.<br>- Don't
leave any food.

194
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,820
Yes.

195
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,980
Eat a lot.

196
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,280
Elders, this is not
much, but please enjoy.

197
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,800
Yes.

198
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,660
I've tried the Assembly Hall food, and
it was a lot better than I expected.

199
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,760
It looks delicious.

200
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,937
Actually, my heart is full
of the wish to treat you to

201
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:22,080
a swanky meal even if I have
to borrow money to do it.

202
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,380
But for an assemblyman to buy
his constituents something...

203
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,440
they say that is not acceptable,
that it is illegal.

204
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,760
You don't have to buy us meals.

205
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,160
No matter what, just try
hard to do good politics.

206
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,560
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

207
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,400
Don't get involved in fights.

208
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,900
Yes, I will bear that in
mind.<br>I will work hard.

209
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,300
By the way, in the newspaper,

210
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,580
I saw your name on the hit list.

211
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,040
Oh! That is... I should
have worked hard.

212
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,100
But I didn't do very well,
so my name made the list.

213
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,220
Since my school days,

214
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,120
I was a troublemaker and my name often
made lists.<br> I'm an expert at it.

215
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,400
No! No! A national assemblyman should
not be too hung up on a nomination.

216
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Don't get too timid
and just work hard.

217
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
Okay, I will never get timid.

218
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,080
I'll work hard. I won't
get timid, really.

219
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,600
Yes, fighting!

220
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,400
- Did you come with
your grandfather?<br>- Yes.

221
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,300
Eat a lot.

222
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,480
By the way, Ahjussi, are
you an assemblyman, too?

223
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,220
No.

224
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,800
This ahjussi is that ahjussi
over there's secretary.

225
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,540
Goodbye.

226
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,020
It's over.

227
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,920
Oh, our pretty Da
Jeong worked hard.

228
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,500
Everyone worked hard.
Let's go inside.

229
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,080
Oh, Assemblyman!

230
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,240
That granddaughter of the
general affairs manager

231
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,380
grandfather asked me earlier
to give this to you.

232
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,360
That little kid?

233
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,080
Yes.

234
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,020
<i>When it rains, my grandfather cannot
go to the Senior Citizens' Center.</i>

235
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,240
<i>Please help.</i>

236
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,900
- We are back.<br>-
You are back?

237
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,400
Did Aide Choi go somewhere?

238
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,320
- She went home early just
now.<br>- Went home early?

239
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,800
Yes, she seemed a bit
under the weather.

240
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,420
Why under the weather,
all of a sudden?

241
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,000
- Please look
into this.<br>- Yes.

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,720
Please look into this properly.

243
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,800
Do not worry.

244
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,420
And don't pick up trash.

245
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,620
But is Aide Choi very sick?

246
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,760
But, Assemblyman, this... I think
you gave me this by mistake.

247
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,340
Assemblyman...

248
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,740
<i>Resignation</i>

249
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,260
Who is it?

250
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,300
<i>It's me, So Min!</i>

251
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,220
Why did you come?

252
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,780
Just one look and I can
tell you're playing hooky.

253
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,480
Assemblyman... what
brings you here?

254
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,420
We came to comfort you in your sickness,
not knowing it was a sham illness.

255
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,980
Come in.

256
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,420
You have all kinds of things.

257
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,080
Drink this a bit.

258
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,100
You shouldn't have...

259
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,840
Are you feeling better?

260
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,460
I'm not sick. I was just
a little bit tired...

261
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,280
A working person goes home early just
because she feels a little tired...

262
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,300
Where is that? The
comptroller's office?

263
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,340
I should tell them to
dock your pay for today.

264
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,780
It's not a workplace that pays you
for overtime, either, you know?

265
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,960
But why have you tagged
along, Secretary Kim?

266
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,480
Just because...

267
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Oh! Isn't this Secretary
General Baek's photo, this?

268
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,760
This is Secretary
General Baek, right?

269
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,260
Oh, right, it is
Secretary General Baek.

270
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,420
Oh, you two went out together.

271
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,880
Aide Choi liked
Secretary General Baek.

272
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,100
Stop joking around, please.

273
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,390
And in an unmarried
maiden's house,

274
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,995
there being a married
man's photo... How

275
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,900
does this work?<br>Is it
okay, legally speaking?

276
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,740
She says it's because she admires
him, not because she likes him.

277
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,100
Hey, Song So Min!

278
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,780
What admiration?

279
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,887
She wants to become a
politician like Secretary

280
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,620
General Baek in the
future or whatever.

281
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,440
You want to die?

282
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,000
Secretary Kim.

283
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,980
Yes?

284
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,300
So Min fancies you.

285
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,120
No, that's not true.

286
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,500
- I will bring some
snacks.<br>- I said no!

287
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,960
- Assemblyman!<br>- Yes?

288
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,440
About Aide Choi...

289
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,100
She's a returned single (DIVORCEE)
but pretends to be a maiden.

290
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,140
Hey!!!

291
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,120
I should've known...

292
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,780
I am telling you clearly so
that you won't misunderstand.

293
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,300
My taste runs
towards idol types.

294
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,960
So don't be concerned and such.

295
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,480
That's a relief. Let's be
on easy terms from now on.

296
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,540
What? Ah...

297
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,680
Really, Aide Choi, I'm not
going to leave you alone...

298
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,100
What did you say?

299
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,460
What? I'm just washing
the dishes...

300
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,100
But, why did Aide
Choi get a divorce?

301
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,840
A long time ago, when she got sloshed
and during her drunken snivelling,

302
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,940
I kind of heard, but

303
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,900
if I divulge that,
I will really die.

304
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,360
Please bring the
dishes from the table.

305
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,560
<i>Resignation (IN CHINESE)</i>

306
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,420
<i>Resignation</i>

307
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,490
With Secretary General Baek...

308
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,260
How did you get to know him?

309
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,160
I joined a circle at college
thinking it was a study group.

310
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,500
But it turned out to be a
bunch of demonstrators.

311
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,580
He was a senior sunbae
in that circle.

312
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,100
Oh, so you go back a long way...

313
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,000
What each of you are thinking,
you must both know at a glance.

314
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,880
That's right... since it's
been over 20 years...

315
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,140
I did think that I
knew in my own way...

316
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,580
That hit list... Is that,
by any chance, for real?

317
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,940
So you got upset and you went home
early.<br>Is it something like that?

318
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,080
No.

319
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,780
It looks about right.

320
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,560
It's for real, right?

321
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,420
Well, I'm telling you no,
so why do you keep asking?

322
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,490
If it's not, then just forget it.
Why get mad?

323
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,160
Do you have a steaming liver (ORGAN
THOUGHT TO BE CONNECTED TO ANGER)?

324
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,920
If my liver is steaming,
yours must be on fire.

325
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,160
I will pay a visit
to Gyeongjae City.

326
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,460
It's not even the weekend. During the term,
why are you visiting your constituency?

327
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,060
There is a little business.

328
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,740
At one time, more than ten
households lived here.

329
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,680
But now, everyone has left

330
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,420
and only that elder and his
granddaughter live here.

331
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,410
Every rainy season, the elder
cannot go to the Senior

332
00:21:57,422 --> 00:22:00,000
Citizens' Center because
of the swollen stream.

333
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
And the little kid cannot
go to kindergarten.

334
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,840
He had petitioned the
City Hall a few times,

335
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,780
but it didn't work so he
brought the matter to me.

336
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,040
Yes, we will try and
review this positively.

337
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,720
Really?

338
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Aigo, our mayor is
really decisive!

339
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,260
Is the mayor so decisive,
to begin with?

340
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,120
Yes.

341
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,320
Then I will rely
on you and leave.

342
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,880
Aigo, our Mr. Mayor
is really firm.

343
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,000
You don't have to see me out.

344
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,700
Be healthy.

345
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,240
Yes.

346
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,920
Oh, really? People from the
City Hall have been there?

347
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,340
Yes, Aigo, you must be busy.

348
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,720
Why bother yourself with
something like this?

349
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,200
Aigo, I should bother. I'm
a national assemblyman.

350
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,140
Somehow...

351
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,080
do you think a bridge
will be laid there?

352
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,840
Of course, just count on me. I
will lay one there no matter what.

353
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,640
Thank you for sure.

354
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,940
Yes, Elder, goodbye.

355
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,400
Have you seen me scoring one?

356
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,760
The City Hall...

357
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,560
could have been there just to show
their face.<br>You spoke too hastily.

358
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,620
Let's live a trusting life, huh?

359
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,060
That mayor is such a
big-hearted person.

360
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,613
And if the City Hall
was just putting on a

361
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,300
show, do you think I will
sit still and watch?

362
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,820
If you don't sit still, then do you plan
to demonstrate in front of the City Hall?

363
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,119
Why would I demonstrate
when I can just ask

364
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:23,600
Secretary General Baek
to put in a word for me?

365
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Do you know how much I helped
Secretary General Baek with things?

366
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,131
You don't know, Aide Choi.
But we are on such terms

367
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:31,540
that I can easily ask him
for this kind of favor.

368
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,560
I guess the hit list
is scary, after all.

369
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,489
Lately, I can't see even
one of your party members'

370
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,180
faces.

371
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,920
Everyone is holed up in their constituency
and not thinking of coming out to Yeouido.

372
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,760
Assemblymen who are unsure of getting a
party nomination... All they can do is

373
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,820
build their recognition
with their constituents.

374
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,580
Some assemblymen daily deliver a score of
congratulatory messages at local events.

375
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,760
Seen from that light, I
think you are amazing.

376
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,460
What do you mean?

377
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,200
Not just a hit list, but you are
about to encounter the Grim Reaper.

378
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,400
But you are so laid back.

379
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,120
You mean Oh Sae Chang, the former
governor of Gyeonggi Province?

380
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,280
He is supposed to return home soon after
a 2-month research program in England.

381
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,160
I know.

382
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,880
I guess at least you did
some secret investigation.

383
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,580
If you are aware, then be on your
toes a bit more.<br>Oh Sae Chang...

384
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,980
will throw down his gauntlet in your
constituency as soon as he returns.

385
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,960
I'm saying this because I've
heard things from our big boss.

386
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,180
As I've said before, I'm confident no
matter whom I go against next year.

387
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,820
This kid is saying this
because he has never lost.

388
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,520
What?

389
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,960
You are a second-termer
in a row.

390
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,560
But I'm a skip-skip-second-termer
with a loss in between.

391
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,920
An assemblyman who has
lost an election?

392
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,840
Aish, I think I'm
going to cry...

393
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,660
Don't regret later and
come up with a plan.

394
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,020
<i>Current Status of D-Class Elected
Gookmin Party Assemblymen</i>

395
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,260
How on earth...

396
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,840
could the names of the people mentioned
in this document have been leaked?

397
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,080
With the exception of Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil, everyone is in here!

398
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,260
I'm investigating how
it came to be revealed.

399
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,420
It's an intolerably
heavy weight to bear.

400
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,100
Let's do away with
this document now.

401
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,820
Is that the Elder's will?

402
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,140
It's my will.

403
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,120
Then, that is rather
insulting to me.

404
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,960
What?

405
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,798
That document, when I took
the office of the secretary

406
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,400
general overseeing the
party's nomination matters,

407
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,060
I prepared and submitted
it to the VIP

408
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,989
with the determination to
replace all the outdated

409
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:55,980
and corrupt members within
the party no matter what.

410
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
- Secretary General Baek!<br>- If
that document is revealed,

411
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,660
my political career may well be threatened.
Fully knowing that,

412
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,060
I made it and submitted it for the
party and the administration!

413
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,600
But, let's do away with it...

414
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,900
Never!

415
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,580
Never will I stand for it!

416
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,340
That person...

417
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,340
What are you going to do about our
Anti-BH members on the hit list?

418
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,534
Right now, there are not only one
or two people who have keeled over

419
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:31,660
from the high pressure and it's not
like they can gripe to someone.

420
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,120
Let's ask the investigating
authorities to investigate right away

421
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,580
who leaked the list.

422
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,680
Let it be. There are a lot of
Pro-BH members on there too.

423
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,540
You are so laid back.

424
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,560
Not just assemblymen
need to undergo changes.

425
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,780
Factions should undergo changes,
too, to secure new talents.

426
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,960
Those people, now,

427
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,578
are our family who have
shared the same bottom

428
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,940
of the pecking order
for the last 4 years.

429
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,000
We should keep the keepers,

430
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,740
and use up losers
to up the ante.

431
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,020
Look at Baek Do Hyeon. He unhesitatingly
bets on the likes of Jin Sang Pil.

432
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,120
It was like a 3-year old
indigestion going away.

433
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,700
Jin Sang Pil, that
mannerless son of a bi*ch.

434
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,880
Jin Sang Pil is just
spit in the sea.

435
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,680
Even though we were left off the
hit list, neither I nor you

436
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,900
can be sure of next
year's election.

437
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,960
If we can't drag
down Baek Do Hyeon,

438
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,060
we may end up, hand in hand,

439
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,580
looking for appropriate
nursing homes.

440
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,380
Ai, that...

441
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,640
Just a minute.

442
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,180
<i>FROM AIDE: Assemblyman, I have an
urgent matter to report to you.</i>

443
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,040
Why were you in such a flutter?
What information came in?

444
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,300
This is it.

445
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,180

D-class?

448
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,460
Without the sender's information,
just naming you as the recipient,

449
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,640
this was sticking out from
the incoming mail box.

450
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,420
A report to the BH

456
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,020

Can you search news right now?

457
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,380
What is it?

00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,720
Kang Sang Ho has just
revealed a strange document.

459
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,000
If there is no dissent,

460
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,746
we will retain this item
in the subcommittee

461
00:29:01,758 --> 00:29:03,720
and address it in the next term.

462
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,260

here...

Where is the Secretary
General, right now?

496
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,580
He is resting at
a certain place.

497
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,443
He has asked you to respond
to the media until

498
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:52,840
he makes his own
special communication.

499
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,253
Never mind the media. The

list are about to tear up
the Secretary General.

Where is he, Secretary
General Baek?!

end, it was for real.

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,500
What happened? What
about the Assemblyman?

509
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,180
Over there.

510
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,570
Assemblyman.

511
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:57,840
In Kyung, it's good that you are here.
Take the Assemblyman and leave.

512
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,960
I am going to meet with Secretary General
Baek, so take your employees and leave.

513
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,340
Didn't I tell you Secretary
General left the office?

514
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,060
He's going to come
to work tomorrow!

515
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,440
I can stay the night here and see him
tomorrow morning.<br>You go home, too.

516
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,260
Assemblyman Jin!

517
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,080
How many times have I told you that the
document from Kang Sang Ho was fabricated?

518
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,840
The one in deeper trouble than you
right now is the Secretary General.

519
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,980
Ah, I'm sure he is.

520
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,710
Assemblyman, I will try to get you an
appointment with the Secretary General,

521
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,440
so please come back to the
office with us for now.

522
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,280
What are you doing?

523
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,100
Assemblyman, let's go.

524
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,280
Let go of this.

525
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,120
Let me go!

526
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,700
Nothing is going to happen,
so all of you leave work.

527
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,960
Assemblyman.

528
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,040
I don't care, so do as you wish.

529
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,740
All staff members on
duty, please come in!

530
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,600
Escort him out as
courteously as possible.

531
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,840
Yes. Assemblyman, excuse us.

532
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,380
What are you, staff members,
doing to the assemblyman?

533
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,580
Aide Choi! If he does not leave right
away, he may get criminally prosecuted.

534
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,260
Let this go!

535
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,580
Tell him that I will
be back for sure.

536
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,460
Okay?

537
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,368
It seems like the assemblymen
on the hit list will form an

538
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,320
emergency measures committee
and start acting collectively.

539
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,220
Assemblyman, you should join the emergency
measures committee, too, for now.

540
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,880
I don't know what you
think, Aide Choi,

541
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,804
but I think that document
Assemblyman Kang Sang Ho

542
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:59,200
disclosed... was made by
Secretary General Baek.

543
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:07,080
Assemblyman, this is not the
time to be hung up on that.

544
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,580
Why is Secretary General
Baek doing this to me?

545
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,974
After giving me a party
nomination and having

546
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:25,440
a very hard time himself
because of that...

547
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:32,620
why, this late in the game,
why is he doing this to me?

548
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,580
Huh? Can't you guess the reason?

549
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,580
<i>I will run, next year,
from Gyeongjae District.</i>

550
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,260
No, I can't.

551
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,340
Wow, really, politics... this...

552
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:00,840
is really icky. Wow, it
is horrible, isn't it?

553
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,860
This is why... This is where that
word "political" originates.

554
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,200
Aide Choi, what is it that you like about
this so much that you work so hard?

555
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,960
Huh?

556
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,560
I will be outside.

00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,320
Have your meeting!
Who is stopping you?

586

How dare you talk down

587
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,940
Shut up and just
start the meeting!

588
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,300
I won't leave you alone if you don't
kick out Baek Do Hyeon from the party!

589
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,880
Why does Secretary General Baek have
to get expelled from the party?

590
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,600
That guy made the hit list!

591

Don't give me your nonsense.
Secretary General Baek is innocent.

Hong Chan Mi! You stay quiet!
Where do you think you

593
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,180
are, butting in as the
little girl that you are...

594
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,760
Ah, please, just, let's
be quiet, really!

595
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,880
We came to observe the meeting, not
to disrupt it, now, didn't we?

596
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,540
That hit list or something,
that is a bad thing.

597
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,660
But everyone here, frankly speaking,
what have you done so well? Huh?

598
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,900
Including myself. How is this
situation different from

599
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,289
getting your name reported
on the blackboard

600
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:44,640
by the class representative
for being noisy

601
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,340
during a self-study period and
begging to get it erased, huh?

602
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,560
Then, let's just shut up and
stay quiet for a bit, okay?

603
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,360
Let's observe the meeting, okay?

604
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,980
We are here to
watch the meeting.

605
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,280
Why are you assemblymen
acting like this?

606
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,220
We have no intention of disrupting the
meeting at all. So take it easy and go on.

607
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,860
You do not have to erase my name,
so I'm just going to leave!

things, really...

611
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,600
- What?<br>- Hey, Baek Do
Hyeon has appeared!

612
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,010
Secretary General Baek.

613
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,100
Before the meeting, may I
address a personal matter?

614
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,800
Oh? Go ahead.

615
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:55,280
Respected citizens of Korea and my
dear fellow Gookmin Party members,

616
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,180
I will blame everything on
my general shortcomings, and

617
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,490
will bury all I want to say,
all my grievances in my chest.

618
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:08,770
Instead, I have made one
grave determination.

619
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,940
For the sake of solidarity
and peace within the Party,

620
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,430
I am about to relinquish what
is, to a national assemblyman,

621
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,940
like a lifeline or rather,
even more precious than life.

622
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,640
I will...

623
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:41,870
My beloved constituency
and constituents,

624
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,560
who have raised me up and loved
me, a lacking person that I am...

625
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:53,100
and who have even elected me twice
to the Assembly...<br>I will leave them.

626
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,008
- Secretary General! Are
you saying you will

627
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,400
give up your
constituency?<br>- That is so.

628
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,546
Then, is there a possibility
that you will not

629
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,440
run for the next year's
general election?

630
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,260
I will take time and deliberate

631
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,890
on my next move that may even include
not running in the next election.

632
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,560
But in the short run, as the
party's secretary general,

633
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,450
I plan to faithfully discharge my duties,
such as improving the nomination system.

634
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,930
To the people and party members,

635
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,820
and to my constituents who have
supported me all this time...

636
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,960
I offer you a bow
of deep contrition.

637

<i>Baek Do Hyeon Declares Relinquishment
of His Constituency...</i>

638

639
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:02,020
Sae Chang, so why are you
running away and stuff?

640
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,359
Assemblyman Park, the Blue
House has issued a statement

641
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:14,760
saying it supports Secretary
General Baek's decision.

642
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,179
Secretary General Baek must have

643
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:20,610
communicated with the
Blue House beforehand.

644
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:23,090
Since he is a prudent person...

645
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:27,640
We've taken a step back on
the spur of the moment.

646
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,110
But the more you think about this, doesn't
it leave a bad taste in your mouth somehow?

647
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,990
Secretary General Baek said he
would give up his constituency,

648
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,840
not that he would never run
in the next general election.

649
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,660
Once he makes up his mind, he will
run from anywhere in the 9 provinces

650
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,590
of the nation.
That's his intent.

651
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:50,050
Right? Then, comparing it to
the world of pro baseball,

652
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,736
this is like a major league
pitcher at the level of

653
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:55,290
Park Chan Ho coming out
on the free-agent market!

654
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:02,900
It seems we've been taken for
a ride by Baek Do Hyeon.

655
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,960
What do you mean, a ride?

656
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,110
Assemblyman Kang, you...

657
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,633
have only played the
part of Baek Do Hyeon's

00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:19,910
puppet.

659
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,290
What?

660
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,370
The poll shows that your
recognition has increased 17%

661
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,860
and favorable opinion
about you increased 8%.

00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,910
Secretary General
must get going.

674
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,590
Don't butt in, when assemblymen
are talking between themselves.

675
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,010
I guess you are very angry.

676
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,490
And you don't know why?

677
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,060
- Well...<br>- Wow, seriously!

678
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,990
Our Secretary General
Baek is incredible.

679
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,350
I'll just ask one question.

680
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,520
Why did you do such a
dastardly thing to me?

681
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,380
This, your words are too harsh.

682
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,110
Then, I will ask you
again not too harshly.

683
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:19,040
Why was I on that list?

684
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:24,650
I think you can ask
yourself about that.

685
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,310
Whether you are a person who
deserves to be on there or not...

686
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:32,220
So you will play off the question again
with difficult words like that...

687
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,440
If you feel sure of yourself, then
that list must be just trash,

688
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:42,400
but if even in your eyes, you don't
have the capacity to be an assemblyman,

689
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:45,580
then you should be
on the hit list

690
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,930
that I, Baek Do Hyeon, drew up.

691
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,290
Just a minute.

692
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:00,180
Because you spoke so reasonably

693
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,990
my noggin was in danger
of getting confused.

694
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,620
But my body commands
me to do this.

695
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,690
Why don't you just eat this up?

696
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,730
Yes, Elder.

697
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,460
<i>Assemblyman Jin, the City Hall says they
won't be able to build a bridge there...</i>

698
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,160
What?

699
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:45,480
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki</i>

700
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,080
Just a minute. The
city hall people,

701
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,993
before they are public
servants, they are super

702
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:58,050
voters with strong influence
over the constituency.

703
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,950
No matter how angered you are, it's
better to deal with them with kid gloves.

704
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,660
Ahew, don't you trust me? Don't worry.
Let's go in.

705
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:10,300
But why are you saying you can't
build a bridge there, huh? Why?!

706
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,158
Well, before, you big-heartedly
went "heh heh heh"

707
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:17,590
as if you were going to
build one there right away!

708
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,870
What is the reason you are
saying no this late in the game?

709
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,460
Assemblyman, calm down first.

710
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,710
Did I ask you to build a Namhae Bridge (BIG
MAJOR CIVIL ENGINEERING PROJECT), huh?

711
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,660
So that the elder can go to the
Senior Citizens' Center, I asked

712
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,200
for a small stone bridge
and that is not doable?

713
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,490
You are saying that because you do not
know much about administrative work.

714
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,880
When setting aside a budget, we
have to do a cost-benefit analysis.

715
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,060
It has a low project feasibility score
but a high risk of getting audited.

716
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,540
In budget planning, projects
requiring benefit-cost analyses,

717
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,980
or BC analyses for short,

718
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,430
their eligibility and monetary
requirements are set by law.

719
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:53,100
This sort of minuscule work
is outside that frame.

720
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,980
See?!

721
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,200
What is important is the will.

722
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,790
We have reviewed it numerous times
after hearing from you, Assemblyman,

723
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,530
but we don't have the
budget to build a bridge.

724
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:07,470
Does this make any sense now,
huh?<br>You don't have the budget?

725
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,540
You keep replacing the fine sidewalk
tiles season in and season out.

726
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,490
- And you don't have any
budget?<br>- Assemblyman!

727
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,070
When you have so little
money, then this city hall

728
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:18,030
building... Why did you erect
this new city hall building?

729
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,550
Just look at the view! I thought
I was at a resort, you know!

730
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,190
But is this an office
building, this?

731
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,960
And I heard that the provincial assemblymen
recently went on an overseas field trip.

732
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,990
With what money did they go on that trip?
Did they go dutch on that trip, huh?

733
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,450
Well, you have the money to build
a building and go on trips!

734
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,528
But that, that little
stone bridge on the

735
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,780
elder's way to the Senior
Citizens' Center...

736
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,570
You won't build that one little bridge.
Does that make any sense now?!

737
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,750
You are just being
too much, really.

738
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,260
Please think a little,
think, think, huh?

739
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,310
Don't you think you're too much?

740
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,710
This evening, the assemblymen on the
hit list will have a gathering.

741
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,990
You'd better attend the gathering because
they will discuss the counter-plan.

742
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:27,930
Please explain the situation to Senior Kim
and try to proceed with it next year.

743
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:30,477
Who knows what will
happen to the assemblymen

744
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,270
listed on the hit list tomorrow?

745
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,680
I will still do it.

746
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,048
Assemblyman. Do you mean
you would make a bad

747
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,010
relationship with the city
because of a mere two persons?

748
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,640
A mere two persons? A
"mere" two persons?

749
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,760
Wow! Really? Aide Choi, seriously?
I am disappointed.

750
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,000
- Pardon?<br>- These "mere" two
persons are not our people?

751
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,990
Assemblyman! Don't get
too sentimental, please.

752
00:50:53,990 --> 00:51:00,450
That senior went to the war with a
gun before his mustache was growing.

753
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:04,590
He risked his life to
protect our country.

754
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:08,860
If such a man can't go to
the senior center freely,

755
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,560
what kind of country
does he live in?

756
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,250
And, how about me, who
can't make it happen?

757
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,830
Am I an assemblyman?

758
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,840
I understand your
words, Assemblyman.

759
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,940
But this is reality.

760
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:37,060
Byeon Seong Gi, please come
here with Secretary Kim.

761
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,010
What are you going to do?

762
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:44,790
For me, the reality
that you said,

763
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,320
I will not acknowledge it.

764
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,320
Here.

765
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:13,090
What kind of urgent
matter makes Assemblyman

766
00:52:13,102 --> 00:52:14,930
Jin unable to
attend the meeting?

767
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:18,230
He has a very important
matter in his constituency.

768
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,030
He wants me to
deliver his apology.

769
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:23,360
Where is a more important
matter than this?

770
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,580
He probably found out
the way to get out.

771
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,210
N-No... It is not like that.

772
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,210
Anyhow, we are apologizing.

773
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,030
We are sorry. We are very sorry.

774
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,040
We are sorry.

775
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,630
<i>Try once to prop it.</i>

776
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,940
<i>Hold here.</i>

777
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,890
Ahh... T-That...

778
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,164
- What happened?
<br>- What do you mean what

779
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,790
happened? I was
very badly reviled.

780
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:37,380
At this rate, the
hit-listed assemblymen will

781
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,490
put our Assemblyman Jin on
their hit list, won't they?

782
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:43,340
If this happens, it will
really be a big screw-up.

783
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:49,820
Aide Seo. Right now, Aide Choi is not here.
How about one game?

784
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,420
- Triggered (GAME
NAME)?<br>- Call.

785
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,760
- Okay. Let's go.<br>- Jacket?
Where is my jacket?

786
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,170
- Let's go without it.<br>- Yes.

787
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,650
<i>Give it ― Oh!!</i>

788
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,780
Excuse me. Are you okay?

789
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,360
I almost fell down! Asshi!

790
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,530
Hey! Be careful!

791
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,080
I am sorry.

792
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,340
<i> I almost fell down! Asshi!</i>

793
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:17,210
Assemblyman Jin!

794
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,440
Elder, you haven't
gone to sleep yet?

795
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,350
- Aigoo. Now,
stop it.<br>- Pardon?

796
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:26,780
This is not a job that you
can do in a few days.

797
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:30,120
That's right. We have no way
to do it within a few days.

798
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,890
What are you saying? Since we
started, we have to finish it.

799
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:38,920
Senior! Don't worry much. I
am good at this kind of work.

800
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,510
If you keep doing it, I will feel sorry.
So please stop it.

801
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,160
No. It's okay. My aide said that

802
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,960
an assemblyman is a
servant of the people.

803
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,630
Please enter the
house and go to bed.

804
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,920
You didn't forget it proudly.

805
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,850
Have you not gone to Seoul?

806
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,340
I am not the sort of woman who
doesn't have any loyalty.

807
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,630
Well...After goofing off
at some place else,

808
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:10,070
and bringing just the water,
then you are saying "loyalty".

809
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:13,450
- I have been to see
Mayor.<br>- Pardon?

810
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:17,010
I offered him the chance to play co-leading
parts in this heartwarming story.

811
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,800
What is she talking about?

812
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,320
<i> Assemblyman Jin!</i>

813
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,130
What happened?

814
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,620
I told them I am working on
your story to be broadcast.

815
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:39,500
And I asked Mayor whether he will take
a villain's part or co-leading part?

816
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,470
Wow! As expected! Really!

817
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,930
You are great for the tricks.

818
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,090
<i>Here! Pass them.</i>

819
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,920
<i>Give me that.</i>

820
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,530
<i>Here.</i>

821
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,210
<i>Put it here.</i>

822
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,350
<i>Here, again.</i>

823
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,570
They connect them up to there?

824
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:20,430
<i>Give me. Here.</i>

825
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,450
<i>Here you go.</i>

826
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,260
Good morning!

827
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,230
Hi!

828
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,430
Good morning!

829
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,560
- Secretary Oh, please give me the schedule
after you have updated it. <br> - I will.

830
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,520
Soo Min! Is there any
news this morning?

831
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,200
Oh Sae Chang... he declared to
run for the National Assembly.

832
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,560
He will run in the constituency which
Secretary General Baek gave up.

833
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,850
The media deride him as a
burglarizer of empty houses.

834
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,391
Oh Sae Chang is said to be a
presidential-level candidate

835
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:17,730
from the opposite party.
Does he look cunning?

836
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:21,850
Don't mind someone else but
concentrate on your area.

837
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,440
What is this?

838
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,280
Project of Managing
JSP Constituency.

839
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,460
What is JSP?

840
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,110
Ahh... JSP. It's me.

841
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:36,090
Ahh. The title sounds great.

842
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:41,790
At this time, Aide
Choi looks very cool.

843
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,920
- By the way,
Aide Choi!<br>- Yes.

844
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,620
Is it okay for you to help
me out this actively?

845
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,270
I am red-lined by
Secretary General Baek.

846
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:57,480
At this rate, you may
be stigmatized like me!

847
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:02,470
Secretary General Baek
is not so narrow-minded.

848
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,920
So turn off your worries.

849
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,150
You are protecting him...

850
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:16,060
Assemblyman Jin, Secretary General
is on the morning broadcast.

851
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,090
- Right now?<br>-Yes.

852
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,544
<i>Secretary General Baek, who became
a man in the news after overcoming</i>

853
00:58:22,556 --> 00:58:24,660
<i>the ripple of the hit-list scandal
by giving up his constituency,</i>

854
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,530
<i>is conversing with me.</i>

855
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:32,430
Secretary General! A lot of people are
curious about your personal life history.

856
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:36,010
Well... I... have not much to say
about my personal life history.

857
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:37,890
I am a very common person.

858
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:41,890
Is past Minister of Home Affairs Baek Seung
Ro, famous for uprightness, your father?

859
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,310
Yes. When my father worked as an
appointed Mayor of Gyeongjae City,

860
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:48,400
I was born in his old age.

861
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,960
- Was his father the mayor of Gyeongjae
City?<br>- <i>Is your place of birth Seoul?</i>

862
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,210
<i>Ah... A month later after I was born,
my father had to transfer to Seoul―</i>

863
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,902
<i>During the process of
transferring, my place of

864
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:00,690
birth was wrongly recorded
in the family register.<i></i></i>

865
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,430
<i> The exact place
where I was born was</i>

866
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,260
<i>Gyeongjae City, Hae Won
Myeon, Sang Won Ri.</i>

867
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,520
<i>Did you hear that,
Gyeongjae City citizens?</i>

868
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,930
Why all of sudden does he
seek for his birth place?

869
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:19,700
<i>I will be honored
if you include me.</i>

870
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,910
<i>When Secretary General said you
would do politics in generations,</i>

871
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:25,460
<i>I am curious as to your father's
reaction.<br>[BAEK DO HYEON SUNBAE]</i>

872
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:29,430
<i>I have something to tell you,
so please come to the office.</i>

873
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:33,640
In the interview, you
mentioned your birth place.

874
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:38,510
I have to roast the meat
when the stones are hot.

875
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,150
I heard the reaction of people
in Gyeongjae City was very good.

876
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,380
Why do you want to see me?

877
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,020
In a short time, a position
at the second level in

878
00:59:53,032 --> 00:59:54,620
the Secretary General's
office will be available.

879
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,750
Transfer to that position.

880
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:02,040
If you and I are
estranged further,

881
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,390
we will never be able to
meet each other again.

882
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,010
I don't want to lose you.

883
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:13,880
No matter what, you are my
closest and oldest comrade.

884
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:23,010
I truly appreciate your words.

885
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:27,290
While going through this
time, I made a decision.

886
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:33,390
- Decision?<br>- Until the next
election, not as your aide,

887
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:36,930
but as Assemblyman Jin's
aide, I will remain.

888
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:45,350
Hello! Please don't say
always to examine.

889
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:49,290
Every time you only examine, then
when can you listen to the people?

890
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,710
When are you going to listen?
Tell me.

891
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,470
Respectable Assemblyman
Jin's words―

892
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:59,170
Don't say <i>respectable
</i> as well, please!

893
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,060
Do you know the meaning
of <i>respectable</i>?

894
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:04,100
I researched that word's meaning all
night because you seem not to know it.

895
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,420
Respect! RES means "high" and
PECT means "admiration"!

896
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,180
Respect means "highly admiring."

897
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,800
Do you highly admire me?

898
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,470
When did you see
me to admire me?

899
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:19,280
You honestly don't
admire me, right?

900
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,390
Take this paper and look at it!

901
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:25,340
<i>Take it! Please look at it!</i>

902
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:33,740
I... want to make
him properly...

903
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:41,270
the next trustworthy assemblyman
from Gyeongjae City!
