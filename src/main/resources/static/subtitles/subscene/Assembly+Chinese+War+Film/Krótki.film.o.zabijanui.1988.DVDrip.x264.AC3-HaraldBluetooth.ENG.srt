1
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:48,803
A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING

2
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,515
Screenplay

3
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:02,083
Directed by
KRZYSZTOF KIESLOWSKI

4
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:22,571
Throwing away floorcloths?

5
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,434
They can be useful.

6
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,533
Someone threw it at me.

7
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:29,133
It hit you?

8
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:31,010
No.

9
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:35,417
Did you see anyone carrying this?

10
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:47,923
I don't like cats.

11
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,196
They're as unreliable as people.

12
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,821
Is it a good film?

13
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:14,455
No, it's boring.

14
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:22,390
What's it about?

15
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,493
It's about love,
but it's boring.

16
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:30,934
Besides, it's only showing
in the afternoon.

17
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:37,678
What are you doing?

18
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:42,248
Pulling out my white hairs.

19
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,114
Where can I find a taxi?

20
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:50,720
Royal Castle Square.

21
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,408
Hello.

22
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:08,467
Hello.

23
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,185
Mr. Balicki?

24
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:27,253
Come in, please.

25
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:36,294
Would you like a portrait?

26
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:38,493
How much do you charge?

27
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:40,360
Two thousand.

28
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:43,398
Does it take long?

29
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,872
What do you mean?

30
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:50,039
It's not my time you pay for.

31
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,774
You pay

32
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:54,109
for my talent.

33
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:57,049
Do you have a talent?

34
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:00,254
No.

35
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:03,115
Can you make shoes?

36
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:07,356
Grow a tree?

37
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,566
A tree?

38
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:13,165
Yes, I can.

39
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,399
No need to worry, then.

40
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,613
Royal Castle Square?

41
00:06:29,852 --> 00:06:31,183
Straight ahead.

42
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:50,038
I'm trying to think about
how I should answer that.

43
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,834
I've been asked
that question twice.

44
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:57,241
When I was in college,
the answer was easy.

45
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:02,180
Then four years ago, right here,

46
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,511
I wasn't so sure anymore.

47
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:07,718
And now...

48
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:10,658
it's a good question.

49
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:14,727
Why do I want to become a lawyer?

50
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,989
Shall I give an honest answer,

51
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:20,393
or shall I say
what I'm supposed to?

52
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:22,734
We want to get to know you.

53
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,866
To put it briefly, I don't know.

54
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:30,776
I'm attracted to...

55
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:33,911
In the past four years, I've seen...

56
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,954
It's a job

57
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:45,519
that we could say
has a social function.

58
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:49,290
It's important to me
that it be useful.

59
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,967
But what I think
I like the most about this job

60
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:58,204
is that...
if I succeed in this exam,

61
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:03,637
I'll be able to meet
and understand people

62
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,408
whom I'd never meet
if I'd chosen a different job.

63
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:10,484
That's my motivation.

64
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:21,993
I think as we grow older
the answer becomes

65
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,557
all the more elusive.

66
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,801
Every man wonders
about the meaning of his job.

67
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,200
I think the further we go,

68
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,475
the more we doubt.

69
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:24,886
The goods, Chief.

70
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:30,289
Hurry up, Beata.

71
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:33,799
Hello.

72
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,788
Go away.
You're scaring the pigeons!

73
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,231
Will you go away?

74
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:23,769
Are you free?

75
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:27,443
Can't you see I'm washing it?

76
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:29,674
We'll wait. It's cold.

77
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:05,411
In your own words,
can you explain the principle

78
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,515
of overall prevention?

79
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:10,508
Basically,

80
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:14,883
it concerns not so much a convict
as the other people,

81
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:18,259
so that they don't end up
like that convict.

82
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:20,929
- Shall I be more specific?
- Yes.

83
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:25,823
It's about how
the acts of a convict,

84
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:29,562
or rather of convicts,
affect other people.

85
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:34,072
It simply involves instilling
fear in people.

86
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:37,278
That's what we read
in the Penal Code.

87
00:13:37,546 --> 00:13:40,208
I don't appreciate
your ironic tone.

88
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,384
It's a questionable argument
used to justify

89
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:45,416
a cruel punishment,

90
00:13:46,188 --> 00:13:47,280
often unfair.

91
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:52,555
Could you support your thesis

92
00:13:52,795 --> 00:13:57,391
with a classical quotation?

93
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:03,303
''Since Cain, no punishment

94
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,029
has been capable

95
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,970
of improving the world.''

96
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:11,335
- Shall I name the author?
- That won't be necessary.

97
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:26,485
Chief made a mistake
with your account.

98
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:37,605
Care for a ride, miss?

99
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:28,777
My wife made it.
You want it?

100
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,158
Eat up.

101
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:49,063
Hello.

102
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:54,699
I have...

103
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:05,171
You're the plumber?

104
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:08,180
No.

105
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:09,710
I thought you were.

106
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:13,948
I have a picture.

107
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:19,184
Could you

108
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:21,687
blow it up?

109
00:18:28,136 --> 00:18:30,036
The crease will still be there.

110
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:35,408
That's okay.

111
00:18:36,478 --> 00:18:37,536
All right.

112
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:42,583
Excuse me.

113
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,018
Can we really tell
from someone's picture

114
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:49,417
if they're dead or not?

115
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:51,626
Someone's been pulling your leg.

116
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:09,842
- How are things?
- Couldn't be better.

117
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:14,044
The last number?

118
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:17,910
Seventeen.

119
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:20,249
I have that one.

120
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:22,616
Sixteen.

121
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,521
Sixteen? That close?

122
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:28,356
Fifteen, then.

123
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:36,001
You always fill them out so carefully.

124
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:37,830
Personally, I like order.

125
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:39,971
You're in luck.

126
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:43,339
How much did you get last month?

127
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:45,074
412.

128
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:47,610
And 1.200 in the autumn.

129
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:50,110
Last week you got 46.

130
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,313
- Adding all that up...
- I'm getting by.

131
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:56,522
But I wish I could...

132
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:58,349
Well...

133
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:00,658
You wish...

134
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:14,435
Our team's the best!

135
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,941
We support the best team!

136
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:33,994
Mr. Balicki.

137
00:20:40,202 --> 00:20:44,901
I'm very pleased to tell you
that you passed.

138
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:48,940
After your four-year apprenticeship,

139
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:51,375
you will be a fellow lawyer.

140
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:54,109
Congratulations.

141
00:20:57,552 --> 00:20:59,645
All you have to do
is take the oath.

142
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,587
I passed my exam!

143
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,063
I'm a lawyer!

144
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:18,796
I'm a lawyer!

145
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,855
Stop fooling around.

146
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:27,552
Get on.

147
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:53,888
German?

148
00:24:58,526 --> 00:24:59,720
From Bulgaria?

149
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:19,939
I can tell your fortune.

150
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:22,441
Some spare change for my child.

151
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,601
You'll leave the country.

152
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,212
No!

153
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:38,959
I'm not afraid of anything.

154
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:46,222
Let me read your palms.

155
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,769
I'll tell the truth.

156
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:53,871
All right, go ahead.

157
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:02,609
- Tea.
- We don't have any more.

158
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:05,917
- What do you have?
- Coffee, pastries.

159
00:27:06,221 --> 00:27:08,280
A coffee and a pastry, then.

160
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,651
- What kind?
- A cream puff.

161
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:14,657
Not that one.
The other one.

162
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,836
Your line of fortune
is long and strong.

163
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:33,069
Two children.

164
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:36,908
When?

165
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:10,033
There are moments in life

166
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,167
when anything seems possible.

167
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:18,336
Your path is clearly
laid out before you.

168
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:22,777
That's how I felt
when I finished school.

169
00:30:24,218 --> 00:30:25,947
That's how I feel today.

170
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,815
When you cross a certain threshold,
there's a moment

171
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,658
when you feel
it all depends on you.

172
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:35,322
Exactly.

173
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:39,422
You know what I think?

174
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:43,128
No, I never do.

175
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:45,834
People will love you.

176
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:50,070
Just like I love you now.

177
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,895
Are you by any chance going

178
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:55,332
to Mokotow?

179
00:32:56,103 --> 00:32:57,001
No, to Wola.

180
00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:58,597
We're in a hurry.

181
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:05,637
To Mokotow.

182
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:08,175
Where were they going?

183
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:09,674
To Wola.

184
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:19,960
Calm down.
He's a bit nervous.

185
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:39,978
What is it?

186
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:41,313
Nothing.

187
00:33:41,883 --> 00:33:45,216
It may not be that easy.

188
00:34:45,012 --> 00:34:46,707
Roll up the window, please.

189
00:34:47,815 --> 00:34:49,077
It's cold.

190
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,261
Turn left here.

191
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:40,394
I could go straight ahead.

192
00:35:40,568 --> 00:35:42,331
I prefer this way.

193
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:44,833
As you wish.

194
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:44,256
Stop. It's over there.

195
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:48,127
- You can't drive on.
- I wasn't going any further.

196
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,325
Jesus.

197
00:42:58,138 --> 00:42:59,867
Please, I beg you...

198
00:43:12,886 --> 00:43:14,353
I beg you.

199
00:45:11,138 --> 00:45:15,040
<i>I'll tell you
about a brave little lion</i>

200
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:18,770
<i>Whose courage grew bigger every day</i>

201
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:21,438
<i>All the other lions</i>

202
00:45:21,615 --> 00:45:23,173
<i>Said to his face</i>

203
00:45:23,317 --> 00:45:26,809
<i>That a lion must always have
the heart of a lion</i>

204
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:31,123
<i>I understand very well
and I like to be brave</i>

205
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:33,792
<i>But sometimes I get so scared</i>

206
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,635
Is it still open?

207
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:53,764
Jacek? Come in!

208
00:46:54,007 --> 00:46:56,441
Hi, Beata!
Are you going to bed?

209
00:46:56,677 --> 00:46:59,168
Yes, very soon.

210
00:47:00,981 --> 00:47:03,882
Come out here a second.
I have something to show you.

211
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:06,050
Do I have to change?

212
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:08,919
No, you don't have to.

213
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:14,459
- Is it far?
- It's right here.

214
00:47:16,496 --> 00:47:18,293
I told you. Get in.

215
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:34,211
You wanted to go somewhere.

216
00:47:35,415 --> 00:47:37,042
Now we can.

217
00:47:41,755 --> 00:47:43,484
You said you had a customer

218
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:45,557
who went to the mountains.

219
00:47:46,259 --> 00:47:47,385
Her husband...

220
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:55,197
We can go to the mountains.

221
00:47:57,337 --> 00:47:59,134
We'll put the seats down.

222
00:47:59,573 --> 00:48:00,972
I have some blankets.

223
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:05,206
The weather will warm up.

224
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:08,372
Where did you get this car?

225
00:48:13,153 --> 00:48:15,314
This session is closed.

226
00:48:37,844 --> 00:48:40,074
Is this the end, Mr. Balicki?

227
00:48:49,556 --> 00:48:50,614
The end.

228
00:49:55,155 --> 00:49:56,247
It's me.

229
00:49:57,657 --> 00:49:59,022
I lost the case.

230
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:01,488
Hands down.

231
00:50:01,995 --> 00:50:03,724
I don't know.

232
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:09,525
Perhaps I'll go for a walk.

233
00:50:10,203 --> 00:50:11,500
No, don't come.

234
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:15,138
How are you?

235
00:50:16,977 --> 00:50:18,376
Did you get some sleep?

236
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:20,605
Good.

237
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:23,473
Yes. Bye.

238
00:50:57,183 --> 00:50:58,115
Excuse me.

239
00:51:00,353 --> 00:51:01,285
Jacek!

240
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:11,449
Excuse me.

241
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:16,054
I know this is not usual practice...

242
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:19,094
Indeed... it's not usual practice.

243
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,694
I wanted to ask you,
now that it's over.

244
00:52:23,937 --> 00:52:26,405
Would things have been different

245
00:52:27,273 --> 00:52:32,006
if he'd had a famous lawyer
to defend him

246
00:52:33,013 --> 00:52:34,002
instead of me?

247
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:35,612
Absolutely not.

248
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:42,112
My summation didn't...

249
00:52:43,723 --> 00:52:45,122
Perhaps if I had...

250
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:46,950
Your summation

251
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:51,193
was a wonderful indictment

252
00:52:51,598 --> 00:52:53,429
of the death penalty.

253
00:52:58,805 --> 00:53:01,933
But the sentence
couldn't have been any different.

254
00:53:03,176 --> 00:53:06,612
You didn't make any mistakes,
not as a lawyer

255
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,170
or as a man.

256
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:13,886
Despite the awful
present circumstances,

257
00:53:14,688 --> 00:53:17,350
it was a pleasure to meet you.

258
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:20,317
In this case,

259
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:24,794
I could have imagined
a better judge.

260
00:53:25,832 --> 00:53:27,299
That sentence...

261
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:29,993
it's my responsibility.

262
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,434
- Does that console you?
- No.

263
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,132
You know,
when that fellow explained

264
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:40,772
how he'd rolled the rope

265
00:53:41,014 --> 00:53:45,178
around his hand in that café...

266
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,685
- I was there.
- Where?

267
00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:52,119
In that café,
at that very moment.

268
00:53:52,892 --> 00:53:57,124
I had just taken my law exam.

269
00:53:57,731 --> 00:53:58,698
Also...

270
00:54:01,768 --> 00:54:03,963
I could have done something.

271
00:54:04,571 --> 00:54:08,667
You're too sensitive
for this type of work.

272
00:54:10,143 --> 00:54:11,770
Too late to change that.

273
00:54:12,145 --> 00:54:16,377
Yes, you've aged a bit today.

274
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:18,776
Good-bye.

275
00:55:06,232 --> 00:55:08,393
The governor will see you.

276
00:56:02,822 --> 00:56:04,915
- How are you?
- Too hot.

277
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:42,470
Hello.

278
00:58:45,118 --> 00:58:46,608
The curtain's stuck.

279
00:58:50,556 --> 00:58:52,251
Clean up the floor a bit.

280
00:59:15,648 --> 00:59:16,410
<i>Come in.</i>

281
00:59:24,624 --> 00:59:26,649
Everything's ready, sir.

282
00:59:39,605 --> 00:59:42,597
Call number 24.

283
00:59:45,244 --> 00:59:46,609
He's coming.

284
00:59:49,115 --> 00:59:50,082
Thank you.

285
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:52,541
I knew it.

286
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:54,049
So did I.

287
00:59:55,888 --> 00:59:57,651
Yes, I know.

288
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:00,985
You'll have half an hour.

289
01:00:04,497 --> 01:00:05,794
Half an hour.

290
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:08,832
Okay.

291
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:17,767
Take the lawyer there.

292
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:21,579
May I leave my briefcase here?

293
01:00:36,062 --> 01:00:37,654
Hello, Mr. Balicki.

294
01:00:43,102 --> 01:00:46,333
I'm going to see him.
He wants to talk to me.

295
01:00:46,572 --> 01:00:48,062
Quite a difficult duty.

296
01:00:49,008 --> 01:00:53,035
Difficult indeed.
It's my first time.

297
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:56,213
I hope it'll be your last.

298
01:00:56,682 --> 01:00:57,671
Mr. Balicki.

299
01:00:59,218 --> 01:01:02,551
It may not be
the best time for this,

300
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:06,755
but I hear you had a son.
Congratulations.

301
01:01:06,993 --> 01:01:07,755
Yes.

302
01:01:09,929 --> 01:01:12,557
Not very long ago.
Thank you.

303
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:13,522
Did you want to see me?

304
01:02:15,094 --> 01:02:16,061
Yes.

305
01:02:19,365 --> 01:02:22,801
Have you seen my mother?

306
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:24,165
I have.

307
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:27,466
Was she crying?

308
01:02:28,241 --> 01:02:29,674
Yes, she was.

309
01:02:30,576 --> 01:02:35,604
Did she ask... for anything?

310
01:02:38,284 --> 01:02:40,275
Did she say anything?

311
01:02:42,455 --> 01:02:43,422
No.

312
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,456
All she did was cry.

313
01:02:50,096 --> 01:02:51,188
Sit down.

314
01:02:57,503 --> 01:02:58,629
Could you...

315
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,467
Could you...

316
01:03:04,176 --> 01:03:06,201
see my mother once again?

317
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,511
When it's all over?

318
01:03:10,516 --> 01:03:14,213
Of course I can.

319
01:03:14,754 --> 01:03:16,745
I thought I'd ask you because...

320
01:03:17,857 --> 01:03:22,294
at the court you called me...

321
01:03:23,863 --> 01:03:25,990
You called me ''Jacek.''

322
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:30,994
I called you...

323
01:03:32,872 --> 01:03:33,861
I wanted to...

324
01:03:37,343 --> 01:03:39,504
I don't know what I wanted.

325
01:03:45,618 --> 01:03:47,950
I'm almost 21 ,

326
01:03:50,089 --> 01:03:52,387
but when you called me,

327
01:03:55,328 --> 01:03:57,193
I nearly cried.

328
01:04:08,407 --> 01:04:09,635
I'd spoken

329
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:11,131
in court...

330
01:04:11,377 --> 01:04:13,971
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

331
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:17,206
It was when you called out to me.

332
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:20,746
They were all

333
01:04:21,454 --> 01:04:24,423
against me,
just like everybody here.

334
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:27,853
They're against what you did.

335
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:29,585
It's the same thing.

336
01:04:37,136 --> 01:04:40,663
So you want me
to see your mother.

337
01:04:43,476 --> 01:04:45,467
Yes, to tell her

338
01:04:46,979 --> 01:04:50,506
to bury me next to my father.

339
01:04:54,053 --> 01:04:57,045
Can I be buried in a cemetery?

340
01:04:58,724 --> 01:04:59,656
Yes.

341
01:05:00,393 --> 01:05:02,657
The priest they sent said I could.

342
01:05:02,795 --> 01:05:04,057
Naturally.

343
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:10,762
Okay, next to my father

344
01:05:11,704 --> 01:05:13,331
there's still

345
01:05:14,673 --> 01:05:18,666
a burial plot.
It was supposed to be my mother's.

346
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:24,046
Ask her to give it to me.

347
01:05:59,118 --> 01:06:00,050
Yes?

348
01:06:01,821 --> 01:06:03,254
Yes, sir.

349
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:17,565
The governor asks
if you're through.

350
01:06:19,738 --> 01:06:20,932
Not yet.

351
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,242
You were saying?

352
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:38,014
I can't remember.

353
01:06:38,924 --> 01:06:41,893
You were saying
there are three burial plots.

354
01:06:43,262 --> 01:06:45,162
Yes, three.

355
01:06:46,365 --> 01:06:49,994
My father rests there, then Marysia,

356
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:54,672
and there's a third one.

357
01:06:55,407 --> 01:06:58,376
Marysia was buried there
five years ago.

358
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:04,781
She was run over by a tractor.

359
01:07:05,084 --> 01:07:06,915
Where we lived in the country.

360
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,686
She was about
to finish elementary school.

361
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:15,790
She was 12 years old.

362
01:07:17,863 --> 01:07:19,387
Finishing elementary school.

363
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,297
I was with a friend of mine
who was a tractor driver.

364
01:07:26,405 --> 01:07:27,929
He was a friend.

365
01:07:28,807 --> 01:07:30,536
We'd been drinking.

366
01:07:31,744 --> 01:07:33,678
Wine and vodka.

367
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:39,045
Then he went and ran her over.

368
01:07:44,323 --> 01:07:47,884
On a field, in the undergrowth.

369
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:56,791
Sometimes I wonder...

370
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:01,604
if she hadn't died,
perhaps...

371
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,809
I wouldn't have left.

372
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:08,871
She was my sister.

373
01:08:10,482 --> 01:08:13,280
I had three brothers and a sister.

374
01:08:13,686 --> 01:08:15,051
Just one sister.

375
01:08:18,057 --> 01:08:19,649
She was...

376
01:08:22,127 --> 01:08:25,494
She was my favorite.

377
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,631
She was fond of me too.

378
01:08:30,903 --> 01:08:33,565
Everything could have been
different.

379
01:08:35,975 --> 01:08:38,671
But then I had to go.

380
01:08:39,511 --> 01:08:41,843
I had to leave the village.

381
01:08:44,783 --> 01:08:46,751
I didn't want to leave.

382
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,081
If I'd stayed, perhaps...

383
01:08:50,623 --> 01:08:53,148
You wouldn't be here now.

384
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,094
Things could have

385
01:08:58,497 --> 01:08:59,759
turned out different.

386
01:09:08,641 --> 01:09:12,839
The governor and deputy
want to know if you're finished.

387
01:09:16,615 --> 01:09:20,142
Tell them I'll never say
I'm finished.

388
01:09:20,552 --> 01:09:22,247
You'll never say that?

389
01:09:22,421 --> 01:09:23,547
Never.

390
01:09:29,128 --> 01:09:31,494
We bought the land

391
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:35,425
because Marysia liked trees.

392
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:39,334
She liked trees and greenery.

393
01:09:41,206 --> 01:09:44,141
That evening,
she was going to walk in the forest.

394
01:10:11,937 --> 01:10:13,370
Do you have the sentence?

395
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:22,841
It's all there.

396
01:10:24,116 --> 01:10:25,174
Let's go.

397
01:10:26,885 --> 01:10:29,251
You can leave your briefcase here.

398
01:10:44,236 --> 01:10:46,261
Bring out the convict.

399
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:09,058
The deputy says to finish up.

400
01:11:17,569 --> 01:11:20,037
In my stuff

401
01:11:20,272 --> 01:11:22,763
there's a receipt
from a photo shop.

402
01:11:23,008 --> 01:11:25,533
I had a photo blown up,

403
01:11:25,778 --> 01:11:28,246
but I had no time to pick it up.

404
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:32,543
Could you take the blowup
to my mother?

405
01:11:32,818 --> 01:11:34,308
What's it of?

406
01:11:35,053 --> 01:11:37,647
Her First Communion.

407
01:11:39,525 --> 01:11:42,653
I took it with me.

408
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:45,321
I creased it.

409
01:11:45,898 --> 01:11:47,024
Let's go.

410
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:01,571
Mr. Balicki.

411
01:12:05,717 --> 01:12:07,082
I don't want to go.

412
01:13:22,361 --> 01:13:23,692
Last name and first name.

413
01:13:25,163 --> 01:13:26,289
Lazar,Jacek.

414
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:27,828
Date of birth?

415
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,831
March 17 th, 1967.

416
01:13:32,104 --> 01:13:33,537
Parents' first names?

417
01:13:33,839 --> 01:13:35,033
Jan and...

418
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:39,375
Lucia.

419
01:13:40,646 --> 01:13:42,170
I'll read the sentence.

420
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:47,880
''In the name of
the People's Republic of Poland,

421
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,918
on the 27 th of April 1987,

422
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:55,319
after hearing
the case ofJacek Lazar,

423
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,187
accused of having,

424
01:13:57,462 --> 01:14:01,728
on the 10th of March 1986,
in Warsaw,

425
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,164
murdered Waldemar Rekowski,

426
01:14:06,972 --> 01:14:11,238
the court found him guilty,

427
01:14:11,576 --> 01:14:15,910
and by virtue of Article 148,
Paragraph 1 ,

428

429
01:14:20,218 --> 01:14:22,345
sentenced him to death

430
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:25,317
and stripped him
of his civil rights.

431
01:14:25,557 --> 01:14:28,253
The Supreme Court upheld
the sentence.

432
01:14:28,493 --> 01:14:31,758
The State Council refused a pardon.

433
01:14:31,997 --> 01:14:35,228
The sentence
shall therefore be carried out.''

434
01:14:47,913 --> 01:14:49,073
Cigarette?

435
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:54,145
No filter, please.

436
01:16:06,391 --> 01:16:07,517
His hands!

437
01:16:23,141 --> 01:16:24,540
Carry out the sentence.

438
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:03,278
Pull it! Keep going.

439
01:17:03,515 --> 01:17:04,641
Enough.
