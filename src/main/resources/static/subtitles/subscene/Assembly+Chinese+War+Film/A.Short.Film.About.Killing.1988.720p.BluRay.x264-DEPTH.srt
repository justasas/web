1
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:38,558
A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING

2
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,107
Screenplay by

3
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:52,405
Directed by

4
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,364
Throwing away rags?

5
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:18,533
They can come in handy.

6
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,535
Someone threw it at me.

7
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,038
Did it hit you?

8
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,623
No.

9
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,836
You seen anyone around
with rags like this?

10
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,891
I don't like cats.

11
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:45,393
They're as treacherous
as people.

12
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:08,917
Is the movie any good?

13
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:10,752
No, it's boring.

14
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,885
What's it about?

15
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,971
Love. But it's boring.

16
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:26,517
Besides, it's not showing
till this afternoon.

17
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,770
There's a meeting now.

18
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,776
What are you doing?

19
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,447
Pulling out gray hairs.

20
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,784
You know...

21
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,703
where the nearest taxi stand is?

22
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,831
Castle Square.

23
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,806
<i>Hello.</i>

24
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,808
Hello.

25
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,137
<i>Piotr Balicki?</i>

26
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,015
<i>Come in, please.</i>

27
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:38,232
Would you like a portrait?

28
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,902
What do you charge?

29
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,071
Two thousand.

30
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:46,449
It takes that long?

31
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,577
What's the problem, my friend?

32
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:52,789
You're not paying for my time.

33
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:54,749
You're paying...

34
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,418
for my talent.

35
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,088
You got a talent?

36
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,674
No.

37
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,427
Can you make shoes?

38
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,932
Or grow a tree?

39
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,352
A tree?

40
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,939
Yeah, I can do that.

41
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,527
No need to worry, then.

42
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:34,122
Which way is Castle Square?

43
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,082
Straight ahead.

44
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,804
Here you are.

45
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:55,309
I hesitate
not because I can't answer,

46
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,522
but because I've been asked
that question twice before.

47
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,775
The answer was easy
on the entrance exam.

48
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:07,947
Then four years ago,
in this same building,

49
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,449
I wasn't so sure anymore.

50
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,494
And now...

51
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,081
it's a good question.

52
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,294
Why do I want to be
a public defender?

53
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:24,380
Shall I give an honest answer

54
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,924
or say what I'm supposed to?

55
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,969
We want to get to know you.

56
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:34,974
To put it briefly, I don't know.

57
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,269
I'm drawn to it.

58
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,147
I've seen a lot
these last four years.

59
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,822
It's a job

60
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,326
that you might say
has a social function.

61
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:57,163
It's important to me
that it fill a need.

62
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:02,210
But most important
of all is that —

63
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:06,339
if all goes well here —

64
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:12,011
I'll be able to meet
and understand people

65
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,723
I'd never meet
in any other profession.

66
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,268
That's why.

67
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:31,322
I think that with the passing years,
the answer becomes...

68
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,116
all the more elusive.

69
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:38,496
Everyone wonders
if what they do has any meaning.

70
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,710
I'm afraid our doubts grow
stronger and stronger.

71
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,013
Delivery!

72
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,476
Beata, hurry up.

73
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,147
Hello.

74
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,665
<i>Go away.</i>

75
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,043
You're scaring the pigeons.

76
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,634
Go away!

77
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,187
Swine!

78
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,886
Are you free?

79
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,932
You can see I'm washing it.

80
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,059
We'll wait. It's cold.

81
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,867
What is your view

82
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,953
of crime prevention in general?

83
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,623
In general terms,
it's the impact of punishment

84
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:37,002
not so much on the convict
as on other people,

85
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:40,506
so that they don't behave
like the convict did.

86
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,008
Shall I be more specific?
- Yes.

87
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,180
It's about how
the convict deters others.

88
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:52,393
The convict becomes the deterrent.

89
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,772
Simply put,
it's frightening people.

90
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,067
Article 50 of the Penal Code
discusses this.

91
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:03,112
I don't appreciate your ironic tone.

92
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,407
It's a questionable justification
for cruel punishment.

93
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:10,536
I'm not alone in that opinion.
And it's often unfair.

94
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:16,000
Could you support your thesis

95
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,961
with some sort of authoritative

96
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,422
or classical quotation?

97
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,050
"Since Cain,

98
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:29,054
the world has neither been
intimidated nor ameliorated

99
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,223
by punishment."

100
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,603
Need I name the author?
- That's not necessary.

101
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:51,368
Ma'am, we forgot to charge
for the vegetables.

102
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,005
Care for a ride somewhere,
Beata?

103
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,173
Excuse me!

104
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,661
My wife made it.

105
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,038
Want it?

106
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,090
Eat up.

107
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,331
- Hello.
<i>- Yes?</i>

108
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,961
I have...

109
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,138
You here to hang pictures?

110
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,350
No.

111
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,143
I thought you were.

112
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,814
I have a photograph.

113
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,945
Could you

114
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,155
enlarge it?

115
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,498
The crease will still be there.

116
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,503
That's okay.

117
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,214
All right.

118
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,011
Excuse me.

119
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,640
Can you really tell
from someone's picture

120
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,351
if they're alive or not?

121
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,604
Someone's been pulling your leg.

122
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,916
- How are things?
- Couldn't be better.

123
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,754
Choose the last number for me,
like you always do.

124
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,299
Seventeen.

125
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,760
I have that already.

126
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,137
Sixteen.

127
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,723
That close?

128
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,935
Then 15.

129
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:16,026
You always fill them out
so carefully.

130
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,903
I like order.

131
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,947
You're always lucky.

132
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,742
How much did you win
last month?

133
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,953
412.

134
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,330
And 1,200 in autumn, right?

135
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,707
Last week you won 46.

136
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,919
You do all right.
- I'm getting by.

137
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:37,631
But one always hopes...
you know...

138
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,383
Yeah.

139
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,802
One always hopes.

140
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,983
Our team's the best!

141
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,610
We support the best team!

142
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,878
Piotr Balicki.

143
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:28,056
<i>I'm pleased to inform you
that you passed your examination.</i>

144
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,852
<i>After your four-year internship,</i>

145
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,396
you are now a fellow lawyer.

146
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,692
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

147
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,030
All that's left
is to take the oath.

148
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,524
I passed the bar!

149
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,984
I'm a lawyer!

150
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,904
I'm a lawyer now!

151
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,739
I passed!

152
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:14,199
Piotr, stop fooling around.

153
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,160
What?

154
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,288
Get on.

155
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,899
You German?

156
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,571
Bulgarian?

157
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:17,447
Let me tell your fortune.

158
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:19,949
Spare a few coins
for my child.

159
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,035
You will travel abroad.

160
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,870
No!

161
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,550
<i>No, I'm not afraid of anything.</i>

162
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,350
Let me read your palm.

163
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,063
I'll tell you the truth.

164
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,400
All right,
but nothing but the truth.

165
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,115
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Tea.

166
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,699
<i>We don't have tea.</i>

167
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:05,120
- What do you have?
- Coffee and pastries.

168
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,789
A coffee and a pastry, then.

169
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,250
- What kind?
- A cream puff.

170
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,212
Not that one. That one there.

171
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:28,268
Your line of fortune is long and strong.

172
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,440
Two children.

173
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,986
When?

174
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,645
There are moments in life...

175
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:22,066
when everything seems possible.

176
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:26,321
Your path is clear.
You can do anything you desire.

177
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,823
I felt that way
after high school.

178
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,618
I thought it would
never happen again.

179
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,203
But I feel it again now.

180
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:38,666
When you cross a certain threshold,
there's a moment...

181
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:42,545
when you feel
everything is up to you, right?

182
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,255
Exactly.

183
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,509
You know what I think?

184
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,261
No.

185
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,138
I never do.

186
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,016
People will love you...

187
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:00,271
just as I do now.

188
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,566
Are you by any chance

189
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,778
going to Mokotów?
- No. Wola.

190
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,446
We're in a hurry.

191
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,787
Mokotów.

192
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,414
Where were they going?

193
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,999
Wola.

194
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,468
Hold your horses.

195
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,136
Hothead.

196
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,990
- What is it?
- Nothing.

197
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:02,078
I was just thinking
it might not all be so easy.

198
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:06,183
Could you roll
the window up a bit?

199
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,895
It's cold.

200
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:58,903
Left here.

201
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,156
Straight ahead is better.

202
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,200
I prefer this way.

203
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:06,869
As you wish.

204
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:10,182
Stop. We're here.

205
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,853
The road's closed ahead.
- I wasn't going any farther.

206
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,047
Jesus...

207
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:18,717
Hiding place...

208
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:24,556
money...

209
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:30,562
my wife...

210
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,566
money...

211
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:37,903
all alone...

212
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,907
Please...

213
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,464
I beg you...

214
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:02,965
<i>I'll tell you
of a brave little golden lion</i>

215
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:06,510
<i>Whose courage
grew greater every day</i>

216
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:09,721
<i>All the grown-up lions</i>

217
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:11,515
<i>Told him</i>

218
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,810
<i>That a lion
must always be lionhearted</i>

219
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:19,731
<i>I understand very well
and I like to be brave</i>

220
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:22,609
<i>But sometimes I get so scared</i>

221
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:44,483
Can I still buy potatoes?

222
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:46,485
Jacek? Come in!

223
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,154
Hi, Beata.
Going to bed already?

224
00:49:49,321 --> 00:49:52,240
After I have a bite.
It's dark.

225
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:57,204
Come outside a second.
I have something to show you.

226
00:49:57,621 --> 00:49:59,539
Do I need a coat?

227
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,167
No, you're fine.

228
00:50:05,337 --> 00:50:07,964
- Is it far?
- It's right here.

229
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:12,094
I told you. Get in.

230
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:28,402
You wanted to go somewhere.

231
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:31,738
Now we can go all over.

232
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:38,078
You said you have a customer

233
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:40,831
who goes to the mountains.

234
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,541
Her husband.

235
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,211
Her husband.

236
00:50:46,962 --> 00:50:50,590
We can go to the mountains.

237
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:54,386
We'll put the seats down.

238
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,805
I have a blanket.

239
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,101
The weather will warm up soon.

240
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:04,020
Where'd you get this car?

241
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,570
This court is adjourned.

242
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,095
Is it over, Mr. Balicki?

243
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,690
It's over.

244
00:52:55,382 --> 00:52:56,925
It's me.

245
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:59,761
I lost.

246
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:02,264
Yes, utterly.

247
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,558
I have no idea.

248
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:09,271
Maybe I'll go for a walk.

249
00:53:09,396 --> 00:53:12,190
No, don't come.

250
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:16,778
How are you feeling?

251
00:53:18,113 --> 00:53:20,699
Did you get some sleep?

252
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:22,325
Good.

253
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:25,078
Yes. Bye.

254
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:02,032
Excuse me.

255
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,035
Jacek.

256
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:17,732
Excuse me.

257
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:22,320
Your Honor, I know
this isn't customary practice.

258
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:25,448
Indeed... it's not.

259
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:30,245
I wanted to ask you,
now that it's over:

260
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:33,832
Would it have made
any difference if he'd had

261
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:38,920
an older, more renowned
lawyer to defend him

262
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:41,006
instead of me?

263
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,674
Absolutely not.

264
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:49,514
Perhaps my words didn't —

265
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:52,642
Perhaps if I had —

266
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,644
Your summation

267
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:58,648
was perhaps
the most eloquent indictment

268
00:55:59,232 --> 00:56:02,110
of capital punishment
that I've heard in years.

269
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:10,368
But the sentence
couldn't have been any different.

270
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:13,329
You were faultless,

271
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:16,666
as a lawyer
and as a human being.

272
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:22,130
Despite
the difficult circumstances...

273
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:26,092
I'm glad to have met you.

274
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:29,262
- Good-bye.
- In this case...

275
00:56:30,305 --> 00:56:34,142
one could perhaps have wished
for a better judge.

276
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:36,978
What happens now

277
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:39,439
is my responsibility.

278
00:56:39,564 --> 00:56:42,025
Is that any consolation?
- No.

279
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:47,113
Perhaps this doesn't
really matter,

280
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:50,617
but when that boy described

281
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:55,288
how he'd wrapped the rope
around his hand in that café...

282
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,833
I was there.
- Where?

283
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:02,420
In that café,
at that very moment.

284
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:07,383
It was a year ago.
I'd just taken my bar exam.

285
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:09,886
Perhaps —

286
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,766
Perhaps I could
have done something.

287
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:19,687
You're too sensitive
for this profession.

288
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:24,234
- Too late to change that.
- True.

289
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:28,029
You've aged a bit today.

290
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:30,281
Good-bye.

291
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:23,501
The warden
will be with you soon.

292
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:22,227
- How are you?
- It's too hot.

293
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:06,391
Hello.

294
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,853
The curtain's stuck.

295
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:16,692
Clean up in here.

296
01:02:40,842 --> 01:02:42,385
<i>Come in.</i>

297
01:02:50,143 --> 01:02:52,520
- Everything's ready, Warden.
- Thank you.

298
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:09,454
Have No. 24 come to my office.

299
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:14,083
He's on his way.

300
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,462
Thank you.

301
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:21,090
I expected as much.
- Me too.

302
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,136
Counselor...

303
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:28,848
you'll have half an hour.

304
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,644
Half an hour.

305
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:36,939
All right.

306
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:38,733
Come in.

307
01:03:42,195 --> 01:03:43,779
Yes, sir?

308
01:03:44,155 --> 01:03:46,449
Escort this gentleman.

309
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,785
May I leave my briefcase?

310
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:07,345
- Hello, Counselor.
- Hello.

311
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:15,895
I'm going to see him.
He wants to talk to me.

312
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:17,897
Quite a difficult duty.

313
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:19,857
Yes, it is.

314
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:22,985
Prosecutor,
it's the first time I —

315
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:25,655
I hope it will be your last.

316
01:04:26,322 --> 01:04:27,907
Counselor.

317
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:32,537
This isn't the best moment,
but we so rarely meet.

318
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,749
My congratulations.
I hear you had a son.

319
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:38,209
Yes.

320
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:42,421
Just recently. Thank you.

321
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:46,736
You wanted to see me.

322
01:05:48,237 --> 01:05:49,614
Yes.

323
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:56,370
Have you seen my mother?

324
01:05:56,829 --> 01:05:58,331
I have.

325
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,459
Was she crying?

326
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,461
Yes.

327
01:06:04,337 --> 01:06:07,923
Did she ask you

328
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:10,468
to tell me anything?

329
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:14,472
Did she say anything?

330
01:06:16,766 --> 01:06:18,142
No.

331
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:22,104
She just cried.

332
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:26,192
Have a seat.

333
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:34,200
Could you —

334
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:37,620
Could you...

335
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:41,624
see my mother again?

336
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,044
Afterwards.

337
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:47,338
Yes.

338
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,174
Of course.

339
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:52,635
I thought I'd ask you because...

340
01:06:53,678 --> 01:06:58,474
as they led me
to the paddy wagon that day...

341
01:06:59,892 --> 01:07:02,061
you called out my name.

342
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,608
I called out to you —

343
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:10,986
I wanted —

344
01:07:13,906 --> 01:07:16,325
I don't know what I wanted.

345
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,292
I'm almost 21...

346
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:29,672
but when you called my name...

347
01:07:32,717 --> 01:07:34,802
my eyes filled with tears.

348
01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:47,773
I said

349
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,483
in court —

350
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:52,361
I didn't listen in court.

351
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:55,823
Not until you called out to me.

352
01:07:57,533 --> 01:07:59,618
They were all

353
01:07:59,952 --> 01:08:03,205
against me,
just like everyone here.

354
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:06,751
They're against what you did.

355
01:08:06,876 --> 01:08:08,627
It's the same thing.

356
01:08:16,302 --> 01:08:20,014
So you want me
to see your mother.

357
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:25,144
Yes, to ask her

358
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:30,274
to bury me next to my father.

359
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:37,114
Can I be buried in a cemetery?

360
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,034
Yes.

361
01:08:40,451 --> 01:08:43,078
The priest they sent said I could.

362
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:44,789
Naturally.

363
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:51,504
Next to my father

364
01:08:52,254 --> 01:08:56,175
is another plot.

365
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,845
It was supposed to be
for my mother.

366
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:05,351
Ask her to let me have it.

367
01:09:41,804 --> 01:09:43,180
Yes, sir.

368
01:09:44,557 --> 01:09:46,392
Yes, Warden.

369
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:01,156
The warden asks
if you're finished.

370
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:04,869
Not yet.

371
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,586
You were saying?

372
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:22,553
I don't remember.

373
01:10:23,304 --> 01:10:26,557
You were saying
there were three burial plots.

374
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:29,977
That's right. Three.

375
01:10:30,978 --> 01:10:35,149
My father's there, then Marysia...

376
01:10:37,192 --> 01:10:39,737
and then there's a third spot.

377
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:43,741
Marysia's been buried there
five years now.

378
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:50,372
Five years ago
she was run over by a tractor

379
01:10:50,581 --> 01:10:52,791
out where we lived in the country.

380
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:57,630
She was in sixth grade.

381
01:10:58,255 --> 01:10:59,924
She was...

382
01:11:00,758 --> 01:11:02,509
12 years old.

383
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:05,721
In sixth grade.

384
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:11,810
I was with a friend of mine
who drove a tractor.

385
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:14,563
A buddy of mine.

386
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:17,107
We'd been drinking.

387
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:20,569
Wine and vodka.

388
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:26,241
Then he went and ran her over
in the meadow by the woods.

389
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:35,459
There was a meadow
next to the woods.

390
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:44,468
Here in prison I've been thinking...

391
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:47,429
if she were alive,

392
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:50,474
maybe I'd never have left home.

393
01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:52,977
Maybe I'd have stayed.

394
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:57,314
She was my sister.

395
01:11:58,774 --> 01:12:01,860
I had three brothers
but just one sister.

396
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:03,654
My only sister.

397
01:12:06,657 --> 01:12:08,325
I was...

398
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:12,788
her favorite.

399
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:16,834
She was my favorite too.

400
01:12:20,004 --> 01:12:22,840
Perhaps everything
would have been different.

401
01:12:25,259 --> 01:12:28,178
But then I had to leave

402
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:31,473
and join a labor brigade.

403
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:36,729
I didn't want to leave.

404
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:40,524
If I'd stayed, maybe —

405
01:12:40,691 --> 01:12:43,569
Maybe it wouldn't
have come to this?

406
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:47,364
Maybe I wouldn't...

407
01:12:48,824 --> 01:12:50,617
be here now.

408
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:03,881
The warden and prosecutor
want to know if you're finished.

409
01:13:07,718 --> 01:13:11,513
You tell the prosecutor
I'll never say I'm finished.

410
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:13,682
You'll never say you're finished?

411
01:13:13,807 --> 01:13:15,267
Never.

412
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:23,150
We bought the plot

413
01:13:23,984 --> 01:13:27,321
because Marysia loved trees.

414
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:31,867
She loved green spaces.

415
01:13:33,285 --> 01:13:36,497
That day, she'd gone
to walk in the woods.

416
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:07,402
Do you have the sentence?

417
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,246
It's all there.

418
01:14:18,122 --> 01:14:19,706
Let's go.

419
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:24,336
You can leave
your briefcase here.

420
01:14:39,226 --> 01:14:41,895
- Bring him out.
- Yes, sir.

421
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:06,378
The prosecutor says
to finish up.

422
01:15:15,012 --> 01:15:17,556
Among my things

423
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:20,475
is a receipt
from a photo shop.

424
01:15:20,601 --> 01:15:23,353
I left a photo to be enlarged,

425
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:26,190
but I couldn't pick it up.

426
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:30,694
Could you take it
to my mother?

427
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:32,696
What's the photo of?

428
01:15:33,197 --> 01:15:35,949
Her First Communion.

429
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:41,413
I took it from Mother's things
before I left.

430
01:15:42,331 --> 01:15:43,957
It got creased.

431
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,043
Let's go.

432
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,099
Counselor...

433
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:06,897
I don't want to go.

434
01:16:14,529 --> 01:16:16,073
Please...

435
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,893
Name?

436
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:29,313
Łazar, Jacek.

437
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:31,148
Date of birth?

438
01:17:31,273 --> 01:17:35,152
March 17th, 1967.

439
01:17:35,277 --> 01:17:36,945
Parents' first names?

440
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,739
Jan and...

441
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:42,826
Łucja.

442
01:17:44,161 --> 01:17:46,079
I'll now read the sentence.

443
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:50,751
"In the name of
the People's Republic of Poland,

444
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:54,880
this 27th day of April 1987,

445
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:59,509
after hearing
the case of Jacek Łazar,

446
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:01,428
accused of having,

447
01:18:01,678 --> 01:18:06,183
on the 10th of March 1987,
in Warsaw,

448
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:10,812
assaulted, robbed, and murdered
Waldemar Rykowski,

449
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:16,068
the court found him guilty,

450
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:20,947
and in accordance
with Article 148, Paragraph 1,

451
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:25,035
and Article 44, Paragraph 2,
of the Penal Code,

452
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,662
sentenced him to death

453
01:18:27,913 --> 01:18:31,041
and stripped him
of all civil rights in perpetuity.

454
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:33,835
The Supreme Court
upheld the sentence.

455
01:18:34,044 --> 01:18:37,464
The State Council rejected
his appeal for clemency.

456
01:18:37,714 --> 01:18:41,093
The sentence
shall therefore be carried out."

457
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,440
Cigarette?

458
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:01,279
I'd prefer unfiltered.

459
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:17,814
His hands!

460
01:20:33,288 --> 01:20:35,123
Carry out the sentence.

461
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:05,946
Keep going?

462
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,536
Let him go!

463
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:15,580
Keep going.

464
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:17,249
Stop!
