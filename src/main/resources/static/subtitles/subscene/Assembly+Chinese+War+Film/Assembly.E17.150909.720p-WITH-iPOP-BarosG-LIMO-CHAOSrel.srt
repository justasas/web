6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,170
Thank you for appearing.

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,420
Assemblyman, I am notifying you
of your rights to refuse to make

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,115
any statement which may
incriminate you and to

9
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,870
have an attorney present
during the questioning.

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,450
Shall we start the questioning?

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,860
Oh, go ahead.

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,150
<i>I tell you this in no
uncertain terms...</i>

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,610
<i>Mr. President, I will subpoena you to
an Assembly investigation hearing.</i>

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,610
Have you made such a statement?

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,900
Yes, I have.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,082
It was with the intention to ask him
to bear responsibility for making

17
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:05,380
materially misleading statements in the
sale of the Babel Tower City Fund.

18
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,556
Isn't it true that right
after your meeting with the

19
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,550
president, in the Hanmin
Bank underground garage

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,450
you received a bagful of cash from
your secretary, Kim Gyu Hwan?

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,090
<i>Do you really want
to have a beating?</i>

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,090
<i>Stop posturing.</i>

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,023
<i>This money... They are
definitely giving it to you</i>

24
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:25,550
<i>so you won't ask for
investigation by the Assembly.</i>

25
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>You just have to
keep silent once.</i>

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,630
Yes, I did.

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,000
The accused has consistently maintained
that he received it and returned it.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,050
Are you going to continue to interfere
with the questioning like this?

29
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:44,230
I am supplementing the statements that may
be used against him in a court of law.

30
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,540
He is exercising his
legal right to counsel.

31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,380
I can have you forcefully
removed if you keep doing this.

32
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,590
If I were you, Prosecutor,
I would not do that.

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,510
I am an incumbent assemblywoman
from the ruling party

34
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,860
and unlike my client,

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,320
I am steeped in the notion that an
assemblyman ought to enjoy many privileges.

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,840
I will make a lot of noise.

37
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,850
Assemblyman, why did you return
to the bank president's office?

38
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,500
To return the money.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,300
Bank President Kim stated that
was to ask for more money.

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,670
He was lying.

41
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,550
You will find out if you look at
the CCTV tape from his office.

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,710
If you look for it,

43
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,780
I went in with the box of money
but came out empty handed.

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,289
Except for the public CCTV
from the underground garage

45
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:37,310
that shows you getting
money from Kim Gyu Hwan,

46
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,250
all tapes were past the mandatory
record-keeping period and were erased.

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,960
Give me some other evidence.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,300
<i>I will come to the media room
with your prepared statement.</i>

49
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,500
<i>No, not that.</i>

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,000
<i>Let's go with
something stronger.</i>

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,960
<i>What?</i>

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,750
If I really was tempted
by that money,

53
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,880
why would I have said
those kinds of words?

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,130
Because the bank president had to be
scared for him to cough up more money.

55
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,180
Look here!

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,550
Assemblyman Jin.

57
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,500
Okay. Fine.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,590
Let's say I did like you said.

59
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,710
Then, if I am that kind of a person, why
would I ask for a special prosecution?

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,509
So that you could deny it like
this, even if the fact that

61
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:26,190
you received a bribe was revealed.
Isn't that the truth?

62
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,250
Wow, you really are
something else.

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,210
You don't need to answer.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,210
Prosecutor, your
unreasonableness is a bit harsh.

65
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,471
The suspect is the kind of
person who received a watch

66
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,550
as a bribe and immediately
converted it into cash.

67
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,130
Whether that's unreasonable, I
guess the judge will decide.

68
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,500
The fact that the suspect took the money
and bought food for the homeless,

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,640
that is also the accused's
consistent position.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,520
Honestly, I don't believe
the suspect's statement.

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,000
I only believe in evidence.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,460
You really do live
a tiring life.

73
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,550
If you want to avoid going to
jail, show some remorse and

74
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,540
admit to the charges.

75
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,880
Not just to avoid
going to jail but

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,330
even if you want to give
me a death sentence,

77
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:22,030
I can't admit that. I won't.
Do you understand?

78
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,090
There is one thing I must
absolutely point out.

79
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,050
Even if Assemblyman Jin
admits all the charges,

80
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,540
if the arrest motion fails to
pass the Assembly this evening,

81
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,300
nobody can detain Assemblyman Jin.
You know that, right?

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,050
Of course I know. But do you think
the arrest motion will fail to pass?

83
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,730
<i>Motion to Consent to Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil's Arrest.</i>

84
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,020
<i>How is the arrest
motion</i> being handled?

85
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,630
The assemblymen are
gathering one by one.

86
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,420
But don't be too hopeful.

87
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,990
Since the Anti-BH faction
decided to vote autonomously,

88
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,070
there is still a chance to block it
with help from the opposition parties.

89
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,170
Ahew, I'll say...

90
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,670
I wish Democratic Party Leader
Oh Sae Chang would help...

91
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,080
The arrest motion will not, by
any chance, fail to pass, right?

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,950
Do Hyeon... it's Oh Sae Chang.

93
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,290
Aigoo, long time no
see, Assemblyman Baek.

94
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,337
Long time no see.
Congratulations, belatedly,

95
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:00,610
on your becoming
the party leader.

96
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,837
Since a person who is not
an incumbent assemblyman

97
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:05,000
took on the important
position of a party leader,

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,250
there are many difficulties.

99
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,933
But in a few months, you
will gobble up the windfall

100
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:13,590
voting district Secretary
General Baek relinquished.

101
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,420
Like a thief burglarizing
an empty house.

102
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, whether I'm
burglarizing an empty house

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,460
or the owner is avoiding
the encounter first...

104
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,100
Which is the case?

105
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,560
Well, it's all in the past.

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,880
More importantly, about the motion for
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's arrest;

107
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,690
How are you going to handle it?

108
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,670
Well, I have spoken
to our assemblymen,

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,800
so wait and find out.

110
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,520
Oh, by the way, Assemblyman
Baek, if it's hard for

111
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,630
you to settle down in
Gyeongje City, come back.

112
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,950
I will welcome you any time.

113
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,120
I will do that.

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,900
Isn't Oh Sae Chang, by any chance, telling
their assemblymen to save Jin Sang Pil?

115
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,840
<i>I put before you the motion to consent to
National Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's arrest.</i>

116
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,520
I think we have to
discontinue the questioning.

117
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,340
Why? Go on.

118
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,170
The result of the
arrest motion came out.

119
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,899
<i>9 Motions Including
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's.</i>

120
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:41,360
<i>Arrest Passed during
the Plenary Session.</i>

121
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,990
<i>Even though it was not an instruction, I
recommended to our assemblymen to vote yes.</i>

122
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,840
<i>Our Korean Democratic Party will
let go of parliamentary privileges</i>

123
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,020
<i>and address our countrymen
in a humble manner.</i>

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,460
Ms. Choi In Kyung, did
you see the news?

125
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,550
Yes.

126
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,860
The only remaining hope is the court's
hearing of the warrant's validity.

127
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,980
When the arrest motion has passed, do you
think the judge will deny the warrant?

128
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,170
I will see you in the courthouse.
Please take care of the Assemblyman.

129
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,290
In Kyung!

130
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,612
After questioning by the
prosecution, Assemblyman Jin

131
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:38,650
is en route to the court
for the warrant hearing.

132
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,450
You want me to hold
a press conference?

133
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,620
Yes, please urge non-custodial
interrogation for Assemblyman Jin.

134
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,900
What are you talking about? Jin Sang
Pil's arrest motion has passed.

135
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,340
The passage of the motion means that you
consent to the Assemblyman's arrest.

136
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,250
It does not mean he
has to be arrested.

137
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,089
Before being an assemblyman, as a
person with human rights, he has

138
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:05,910
the right to be questioned while
maintaining his personal freedom.

139
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,800
Sunbae-nim, please help us.

140
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,250
I understand your feelings.

141
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,090
But you know better than I how I am kind
of riding Gookmin Party's coattails.

142
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,630
Not just coattail riding, but you've
become Secretary General Baek's lackey.

143
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,950
Hey, Choi In Kyung, are you really going
to keep saying those sorts of things?!

144
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,090
I am saying this for your sake.

145
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,980
Stop ruining yourself and
join my Assemblyman now.

146
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,960
What?!

147
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,540
Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi has joined
the Indifferent-to-BH faction.

148
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,990
If you join as well, it will become
a force to be reckoned with.

149
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,050
That is the only way for
you to overcome the stigma

150
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,500
of being a migratory bird
and do politics with pride.

151
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,110
Oh, yes.

152
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,090
Oh, Assemblyman Jo, you will
have to play the trumpet.

153
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,800
What?

154
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,020
I support Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's interrogation under custody.

155
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,588
No words can express the
distress I feel for

156
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,410
having to call for a fellow
assemblyman's arrest.

157
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,006
However, the cozy relations
between politics and business

158
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:22,670
are like a mass of cancer cells
that kills Korean politics.

159
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,480
The deep-rooted corruption of Korean
politics where dirty money changes hands

160
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,840
between politicians and
businessmen must disappear.

161
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,990
In Kyung,

162
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,470
let us not meet as sunbae
and hoobae in the future.

163
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,800
That's what I hope for, too.

164
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,480
I am Assemblywoman
Cheon No Shim.

165
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,760
Even though Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's arrest motion has passed,

166
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,620
I firmly believe that
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil

167
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,510
is a person our Assembly needs.

168
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,790
I want Assemblyman Jin
to be released and

169
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,390
stand trial while carrying
out his legislative duties.

170
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,260
Accordingly, I have decided

171
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,640
to submit a petition
to the court to deny.

172
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,990
Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's arrest warrant.

173
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,460
I wish a lot of like-minded
fellow assemblymen would join me.

174
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,900
Assemblyman Park, do you want
to sign one of these too?

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Petition?

176
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,640
Yes, Cheon No Shim and
Jin Sang Pil's staff are

177
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,960
handing out these petitions
together in the Assembly Center.

178
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,260
I guess they want to give these to the
judge assigned to the warrant hearing.

179
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,260
What are you doing right now?

180
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,558
When an opposition party
assemblywoman is getting

181
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,510
in knee-deep like that
trying to help him,

182
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,860
if we, as fellow party
assemblymen, turn a blind eye,

183
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,330
people will call us unfeeling.
No,

184
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:56,630
we conservatives have humanity, too.
We should show them.

185
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:03,030
Do you think the prosecution will do
nothing if Jin Sang Pil is released?

186
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,590
Do you think

187
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,385
the prosecution does not
know about Lee Taek Jo

188
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:09,970
handing out designer
watches to assemblymen?

189
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,180
While they are overlooking it because of
political pressures, let sleeping dogs lie.

190
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,373
Come to think of it, if he
did something wrong, he

191
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:24,800
should eat bean rice
(EUPHEMISM FOR GOING TO JAIL).

192
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,820
Lay low for the time being.

193
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,370
Because the sword is in the
hands of the prosecution.

194
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,860
Ah, yes, quickly call your old man
and ask him to put his seal on it.

195
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,430
What is this?

196
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,280
This is Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's office.
Have you reviewed the petition we sent you?

197
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,540
Here.

198
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,590
To those doubful assemblymen,
you have to highlight

199
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,940
no risk of destruction of evidence or
flight as much as possible, understand?

200
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,680
Yes.

201
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,256
Thank you. Aide-nim,
Assemblyman Lee Sam Tae of

202
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:59,640
the Korean Democratic
Party will endorse it.

203
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,770
Run and get it.

204
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,430
Yes.

205
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,940
<i>The accused is an assemblyman of the
Republic of Korea. The people...</i>

206
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,850
What are you doing? We have no
time, type it up fast, fast!

207
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,280
Aide-nim, here!

208
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,520
Okay. Aide Seo, how about
the Anti-BH faction?

209
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,590
Aigoo, I got it, I got it.
Hang up, hang up.

210
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,280
All Anti-BH assemblymen
are saying no.

211
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,220
What? When they agreed to vote
autonomously on the arrest motion?

212
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,320
I guess they have had
a change of heart.

213
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,950
Those bastards...

214
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,610
This won't be enough to
change the judge's heart.

215
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,830
Yes, this is Choi In Kyung.

216
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,290
Aide-nim.

217
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,970
Kim Gyu Hwan?

218
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,250
I... have a favor to ask.

219
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,260
The accused is an assemblyman and as
such, there is no risk of flight.

220
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,860
I acknowledge that there
is no risk of flight.

221
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,000
However, using his privileged position as
an assemblyman, he may spoliate evidence.

222
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,477
He relinquished his parliamentary
immunity and voluntarily

223
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:04,360
appeared. Please take
that into consideration.

224
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,720
The law should be more stringently
applied towards a public figure.

225
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,030
Probable cause as to the criminal act is
lacking. Please deny the arrest warrant.

226
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,390
Please, Your Honor.

227
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,770
I already asked the prosecutor
but she did not allow this.

228
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,390
Please let me see Bank President
Kim Doo Shik face to face.

229
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,690
I think I know why
he lies like that.

230
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,640
I will give you a
chance to speak later,

231
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,900
so be quiet and sit down.

232
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,910
What is Choi In Kyung doing?

233
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,160
We have arrived. We
are right outside.

234
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,760
Aigoo, you should have come sooner.
Petitions, petitions!

235
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,460
Assemblywoman! Has
the hearing started?

236
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,360
Of course it has started.

237
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,020
Why is he here?

238
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,902
He is the son of the late Mr.
Bae Dal Soo, the laid-off

239
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:08,730
worker from Korea Shipbuilding
and Repairs Company.

240
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,480
Bae Dal Soo?

241
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,870
Bae Dal Soo!

242
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,490
I want to testify that the designer watch
and bribe from the Hanmin Bank president

243
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,710
incidents all occurred
because of me.

244
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,670
Because the Assemblyman has known about
Secretary Kim's identity for a long time,

245
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,698
if he had really wanted the
bribe, he would not have gotten

246
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,580
it through Secretary Kim. He
will testify to that, too.

247
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,320
Aigoo, these people, seriously!

248
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,420
Then, if Secretary Kim testifies,
can he somehow not get arrested?

249
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,760
That's up to the judge.

250
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,090
The prosecution won't let you alone.
Have you come prepared for it?

251
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,200
Yes.

252
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,017
<i>Petitions for Denial of
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's.</i>

253
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:02,290
<i>Arrest Warrant by Cheon
No Shim and 22 Others.</i>

254
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,894
Those are petitions
submitted by 23 assemblymen

255
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,080
including Assemblywoman
Cheon No Shim.

256
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,416
They are asking for a
non-custodial investigation

257
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:17,010
according to the principle
of presumption of innocence.

258
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,350
Please take them
into consideration.

259
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,720
Additionally,

260
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,670
there is a witness who wants to testify
to the innocence of the accused.

261
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,430
Please give him a
chance to testify.

262
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,610
Who is it?

263
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,740
It is the accused's secretary, Mr.
Kim Gyu Hwan.

264
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,740
Objection! Mr. Kim Gyu Hwan
is an abettor in this crime.

265
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,771
Even if he were an
abettor, if his testimony

266
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:45,780
would help in deciding
the accused's arrest,

267
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,940
he ought to be given
a chance to testify.

268
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,320
But, Assemblywoman Hong!

269
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,250
What are you talking about?
Why would the kid come here?

270
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:59,400
Your Honor! I request Mr.
Kim Gyu Hwan's testimony.

271
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,700
No! Your Honor, that
is not necessary.

272
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,840
The kid who should be studying now...
why would he appear here?

273
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,160
Your Honor!<b>- No, you cannot allow it.
You absolutely must not!</b>

274
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,060
Secretary Kim, get ready.

275
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,190
Just stay here.

276
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,860
His testimony has been denied.

277
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,900
What do you mean denied?

278
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,190
Please ask the judge again.
I must give it.

279
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,140
Assemblyman Jin's objection was more
decisive than the judge's opinion.

280
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,040
What?

281
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,190
Assemblyman Jin seems to have
worried about possible harm to you.

282
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,240
Then, what will happen
to Assemblyman Jin now?

283
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,060
The arrest warrant was signed.

339
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,480
<i>that is not hung up
on vested interests.</i>

340
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,030
<i>I invested my hope in the
sunbae who was that person.</i>

341
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:49,500
<i>Please come back to
yourself of that time.</i>

342
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,215
Of course Reporter Kim,
the Indifferent-to-BH

343
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:05,820
faction is alive and kicking.

344
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,215
Of course, Assemblyman Jin
has been detained but

345
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,340
he is still an assemblyman
until convicted.

346
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,180
Moreover, I, Hong
Chan Mi, am here.

347
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,890
Yes, yes.

348
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,220
You are here, Assemblywoman?

349
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,880
What is it, Ms. Choi 00?

350
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,240
I'm saying good-morning to the deputy
boss of our Indifferent-to-BH faction.

351
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,020
You're prohibited from coming
within a 1-meter radius of me.

352
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,910
Assemblywoman, please
preside over our meeting.

353
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,290
What meeting?

354
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,030
A meeting of the Indifferent-to-BH
faction headquarters.

355
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,200
Headquarters?

356
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,520
Sim Dong Cheon?

357
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,990
Yes.

358
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,827
From now on, the
Indifferent-to-BH.

359
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,190
Headquarters aide assisting
Assemblywoman Hong

360
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,830
will be Secretary Sim.

361
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,880
Wow!

362
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,010
Are we getting back
together like this?

363
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,520
Yes.

364
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,090
"Hello again though I hate you."

365
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,620
Oh, well,

366
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,960
he is not my type, but
I will do as told.

367
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,010
So, what is the meeting agenda, Ms.
Choi 00?

368
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,800
How to break Hanmin Bank
President Kim Doo Shik.

369
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,050
I won't have much
trouble, right?

370
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,530
At the most, you will get
fined for offering a bribe.

371
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,730
Please use your influence
with the prosecution.

372
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,490
Bank President.<b>- Yes.</b>

373
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,740
From the beginning, there was
only one term between us.

374
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,341
In exchange for our
turning a blind eye to

375
00:29:21,353 --> 00:29:23,040
your illegal lending of
$140M to Bando Group,

376
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,040
you will deny the fact that Jin
Sang Pil returned the money.

377
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,560
That is so, but...

378
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,760
Still, please give me
some consideration.

379
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,480
Well, I will give it a try.

380
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,070
Just how do you intend to
get the bank president?

381
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,050
We'll have to hire some people.

382
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,950
What do you mean some people?

383
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,940
You drag the guy
into a dug hole.

384
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,040
Then, you just shovel the dirt on him.
One shovel at a time.

385
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,420
Until he says the correct
thing, until the end.

386
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,040
Because that's too violent,
in the food that he eats,

387
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,060
let's secretly poison the food.

388
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,350
Then, I guess we have
to start tailing him.

389
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,660
Tail him?

390
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,370
When we get a chance,
bug his car as well.

391
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,710
Bugging?

392
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,600
My uncle sells stolen bugging
devices pretty cheaply.

393
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:22,380
Aide, should I buy a few with the
political contributions we received?

394
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,240
Oh, really! Really!

395
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,978
After you ask an
assemblywoman to come, what

396
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,740
are you trying to do?
Are you fooling around?

397
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,490
With normal tactics, we can't change
the bank president's mind, can we?

398
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,170
What?

399
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,320
No... the Indifferent-to-BH
faction is a place like this?

400
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,000
Yes, it is like this.

401
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,460
I'm really going to go crazy.

402
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:58,040
Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi, welcome
to the Indifferent-to-BH faction.

403
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,340
Please have a seat.

404
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:20,030
Now, we will really start the meeting
to get the Hanmin Bank president.

405
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,050
Yes, let's get him.

406
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,750
What is this?

407
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,380
Reporters, long time no see.

408
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,590
I am Gookmin Party's
Hong Chan Mi.

409
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,300
Regarding Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's arrest and imprisonment,

410
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,540
I will state our Indifferent-to-BH
faction's position.

411
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,060
The issue of this case is whether
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil

412
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,600
returned the money he had received from
Hanmin Bank President Kim Doo Shik.

413
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,820
While Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil who is
denying the criminal charge is in prison,

414
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,420
Bank President Kim who has confessed to
offering a bribe is free to strut around.

415
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,420
This is wrong.

416
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,431
We, the Indifferent-to-BH
faction, demand that Hanmin Bank.

417
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:32,670
President Kim Doo Shik who is the
cause of this scandal resign.

418
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,150
<i>Moreover, we make this solemn request
to the Financial Supervisory Service.</i>

419
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,199
<i>Hanmin Bank is a financial
institution where</i>

420
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:43,000
<i>vast sums of public
funds were injected.</i>

421
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,972
<i>We are requesting that you
immediately conduct a special</i>

422
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:48,810
<i>audit of the Bank and Bank
President Kim's activities.</i>

423
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,750
Kim Doo Shik, Resign!

424
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,720
Resign! Resign!

425
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,700
Conduct a special audit!

426
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,590
Conduct it! Conduct it!

427
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,330
Kim Doo Shik, Resign!

428
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,340
Resign! Resign!

429
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,300
Conduct a special audit!

430
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,050
Conduct it! Conduct it!

431
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,880
Kim Doo Shik, Resign!

432
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,630
Resign! Resign!

433
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,500
Conduct a special audit!

434
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,030
Conduct it! Conduct it!

435
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,530
The economy will suffer if you poke
around a financial institution now!

436
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,750
How can you be swayed by this kind
of perverse demand for scrutiny?

437
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,190
Yes, then...

438
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,580
Tell Bank President
Kim not to worry.

439
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,770
Yes, I understand.

440
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,885
Secretary General Baek must
have used his influence

441
00:33:37,897 --> 00:33:39,340
with the Financial
Supervisory Service already.

442
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,090
Jeez, we have to have a
stronger card to play.

443
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:46,670
The card calling for the Financial
Supervisory Service audit was just a feint.

444
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,020
A feint?<b>- Our Indifferent-to-BH
faction's hidden punch is this.</b>

445
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,083
<i>According to Article 127-2 of the National
Assembly Act, request the Board of Audit</i>

Board of Audit and Inspection
to conduct an audit.

450
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,590
The Board, after receiving the
request, within 3 months,

451
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,750
has to report the audit
findings to the Assembly.

452
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,260
A resolution means a majority
of the assemblymen must agree.

453
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,740
Is there anything our matchless
Assemblywoman Hong cannot do?

454
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,050
Ah, you sly fox...

455
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,810
Board of Audit and Inspection... A
resolution for an audit request...

456
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,870
Hong Chan Mi is the primary
sponsor and to gather 10

457
00:34:36,882 --> 00:34:40,360
co-sponsors, she is contacting
opposition party assemblymen.

458
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,810
Jin Sang Pil disappears but now,
Hong Chan Mi is causing a ruckus.

459
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,100
Even if one assemblyman
seems like nothing,

460
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,000
when you look into it,
they can be scary.

461
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,130
<i>What is this?</i>

462
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,920

<i>So I want to give some support

The Citizens' Federation
for Transparent Politics

465
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:12,790
claims that Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi of Gookmin Party

466
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,700
circumvented the law and
gave political contributions

467
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,350
to the party's prominent
assemblymen illegally

468
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,020
<i>and reported her to the
National Election Commission.</i>

469
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,290

Assemblywoman, the National
Election Commission

00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:33,830
will come to audit our
books and accounts.

<i>Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon.</i>

477
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,800
Although I haven't lived long,

478
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,040
I get to be slapped after
giving money, I guess.

479
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,380
What is it that you want?

480
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,907
I heard that you are sponsoring
a resolution to request

481
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:11,050
the Board of Audit and
Inspection for an audit.

482
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,090
Stop it.

483
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,490
You may have thought that I would get
afraid with this kind of thing but no way!

484
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,377
Just because of my giving
you improper political

485
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,250
funds, do you think something
will happen to me?

486
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:28,750
In any event, I have no lingering
feelings for the Assembly Hall so

487
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,500
I have nothing that scares me.

488
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,490
This was just a
warning.<b>-What warning?</b>

489
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:38,300
A warning that shows you next time,
you may be hit with a harsher thing.

490
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,960
If you want to at least
practice law next year,

491
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,330
it will be good to keep
my warning in mind.

492
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,620
Secretary General Baek!

493
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,080
Warning, my ass.

494
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,900
Aide<b>-What about
Assemblywoman Hong?</b>

495
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,370
Earlier, they say she left
work in the afternoon.

496
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,780
You can give her a call. She's
probably working around here.

497
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,540
Her phone has been turned off.

498
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,450
What?

499
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,370
I think she's a bit
intimidated after being

500
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:28,380
reported to the National
Election Commission.

501
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,480
It's normal for anybody to get a bit
nervous when they experience those things.

502
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,920
Since Assemblywoman has a strong
will, don't think futile thoughts.

503
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,570
You must not tell the Assemblyman about
Assemblywoman Hong disappearing on us.

504
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,800
I got it.

505
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,437
Whether the food we
privately sent him was

506
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:52,290
edible, whether he wants
any books or magazines,

507
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,429
whether he has enough in
his commissary account,

508
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,460
you must make sure to
check and tell me later.

509
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,860
I'll be back.<b>-Yes, okay.</b>

510
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,840
Secretary Byeon! This.

511
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:19,960
Even though Assemblyman Jin is
not there, you seem very busy.

512
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,210
You know about the resolution for an audit
by the Board of Audit and Inspection.

513
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,285
It seems like Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi might

514
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:33,300
not want to do it. Why
don't you give it up?

515
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,380
It seems like you still haven't come to
your senses after getting a slap from me.

516
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,460
Please... let's not live as
trash but as human beings.

517
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,270
If you keep it up
this way, Aide Choi,

518
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,790
you might get really hurt.

519
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,460
Now, you don't even hesitate
before making threats.

520
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,090
Well, do as you wish.

521
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm not the type to be
had by a piece of trash.

522
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,300
Secretary Kim!

523
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,160
It's been a while.

524
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,060
How the two of you are here...

525
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,800
Assemblyman Jin said that he knew from a
long time ago that you were attending here.

526
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:51,380
Assemblyman is asking for you to visit.
When is a good time?

527
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,710
Let's not do this here but
let's talk while eating.

528
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,260
Okay, let's go have
something yummy.

529
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,420
I don't intend to do that.

530
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,040
Wait a minute.

531
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:10,030
What do you think about joining
the Assembly office again?

532
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,600
For me...

533
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,580
The mere sound of the <i>po</i> from
politics is quite disgusting.

534
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,540
I was deceived by Aide
Choi for a moment.

535
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:36,540
I thought politics was so cool.

536
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:41,960
That's why I tried to make a bill through
the struggle, which didn't work.

537
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,550
By the way,

538
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,120
after all, it is trashy.

539
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,480
Secretary Kim.

540
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,770
Because it is trashy
or disgusting,

541
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,370
are you going to ignore it
for the rest of your life?

542
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,860
No matter how much you
despise or deny politics,

543
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:02,220
it is always governing
the whole of your life.

544
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,140
Anyhow, it is a worthless life.

545
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,300
I don't care whether it
is governed or whatever.

546
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,920
Let them do whatever
they want to do.

547
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,720
Kim Gyu Hwan.

548
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:21,180
I know you are acting like this because
of feeling guilt towards Assemblyman.

549
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,720
That isn't your fault.
So don't blame yourself.

550
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,050
That's right. I have
heard the story.

551
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:35,760
Our secretaries all
understand you.

552
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,620
Let's stop here. And I am
asking as a favor that

553
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:46,210
you don't look for me anymore.

554
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,140
Secretary Kim!

555
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:31,150
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

556
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,760
Who are you?

557
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,000
Aide Choi, how are you?

558
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,450
I am not very good.

559
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,860
Why?

560
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:04,290
Omo! You look worn out.
Didn't you sleep last night?

561
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,510
Yes. I was filming by
myself last night.

562
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:11,220
A mysterious thriller,
horror movie.

563
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,950
I seem to be getting
sensitive these days.

564
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,060
Hello.

565
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,130
Aide Choi, I got your mail.

566
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,373
<i>To Aide Choi In Kyung<b>c/o
Gookmin Party, Assemblyman Jin.</i>

567
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:24,530
<i>Sang Pil 1 Yeongdeungpo-dong,
Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul</i>.</b>

568
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,010
It doesn't show a sender.

569
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,630
<i>What is this?</i>

570
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,280
What is this?

571
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,410
Aish! It looks like flour.

572
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,080
<i>Aide Choi, weren't
you splattered?</i>

573
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,880
Uhh! Da Jeong, what is this?

574
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,280
<i>Turn your head. It's there too.</i>

575
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,510
Aide Choi, report
this to the police.

576
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,480
Police?

577
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,680
This white powder must...

578
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,510
signify white terror
(STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM).

579
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:05,570
Stop it.

580
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,980
I am right. Someone is threatening
Aide Choi with an act of terror.

581
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,290
Be quiet!

582
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,400
For a while,

583
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,980
we have to keep this secret.

584
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,970
If Assemblyman hears
this, nine out of ten,

585
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:31,240
he will tell us to stop
the audit request.

586
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,910
Do you understand?

587
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,280
Aide Choi!<b>- Absolutely,</b>

588
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:39,780
no one is to disclose
this matter.

589
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,970
Ah.

590
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,980
Ah, you came.

591
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,460
Have you been good?

592
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:31,780
Of course. It is not bad at all.
The meals are delicious.

593
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,590
There is no one nagging.
It's like a paradise.

594
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:40,110
Sit down. Don't I look
like I'm gaining weight?

595
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,810
Sit down quickly.

596
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:47,900
That's why I told you I would
request special visitation.

597
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,200
A special visitation
allows more time.

598
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,760
We can see each other more
comfortably in an office.

599
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,340
What is this glass between us?
It looks miserable.

600
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,960
Aigoo. Did I come here
to be treated well?

601
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:05,110
It is not right for me as an assemblyman
to get special treatment in jail.

602
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,620
Sit down quickly. We don't
have much time left.

603
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,730
When I look at you this
way, it's refreshing.

604
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,380
How about Assemblywoman Hong?
Is she alright?

605
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,910
I heard she was accused by the
National Election Commission.

606
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:24,970
She is courageous.

607
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,390
Since she's grown up sheltered,
she must be disturbed.

608
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:32,720
As soon as I get out of here, I will
knock Secretary General Baek down.

609
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,690
Should I break out of here
and get out right now?

610
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,380
Aide Choi, are you sick?

611
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,120
Pardon? No, I am not.

612
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,530
You look weak. Did
something happen?

613
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,830
Nothing happened.

614
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:53,180
Oh, no. Have I seen you
only once or twice?

615
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,790
Just looking at you,

616
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,924
it's not true that nothing happened.
It is written

617
00:48:56,936 --> 00:48:59,040
on your face that you have
something worrying you.

618
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,930
There is nothing to worry about.

619
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:05,430
In case you were worried,

620
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:10,930
I just came to show my face
and tell you to be strong.

621
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:17,890
I know that you are
having a hard time.

622
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:23,950
I am sorry that I am merely
staying comfortably inside here.

623
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,090
When I get out of here, I
will really repay everything.

624
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,330
Yes. You must pay me back.

625
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:34,920
If only to receive what I
am owed from you, I must

626
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,100
get you out of here.

627
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,190
I will surely do it!

628
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,900
Aide Choi.

629
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,640
Without the rank insignia
(DISREGARDING RANKS),

630
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,860
may I tell something
in my heart?

631
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,760
Go ahead.

632
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,060
Except my wife,

633
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:20,370
among the women whom I know,
you are the most beautiful,

634
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,390
the smartest,

635
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,570
and the best-hearted.

636
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,850
You are saying that

637
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:36,730
I am the best, aren't you?

638
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,370
No. I mean I appreciate you.

639
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:46,590
That such a person
became my comrade...

640
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,090
Really,

641
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,090
truthfully, extraordinarily,

642
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,850
I feel sorry and

643
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,820
thankful.

644
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,050
Aigoo,

645
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:09,000
I can't even give
you a handkerchief.

646
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,020
I am such a silly goose.

647
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,260
I heard Assemblywoman Hong
is shutting herself up.

648
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,973
Probably, she is exercising
self-discipline since she

649
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,660
has been accused by the
National Election Commission.

650
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,960
Is she so timid?

651
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,240
She was running wild to
utilize the Audit Board.

652
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,960
Anyhow, there will be no demand for an
audit submitted to the National Assembly.

653
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,220
By the way, what business
prompted you to ask to see me?

654
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:53,520
Since it looks like the
Indifferent-to-BH is quiet,

655
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:00,760
would you make a written promise about
the division of party nominations?

656
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,760
Assemblyman Park, just believe me and
let's go with a gentlemen's agreement.

657
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,490
If you were the old Secretary
General Baek, I would.

658
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,830
Right now, it is difficult
to do it that way.

659
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:15,070
I think that Jin Sang Pil

660
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,730
was framed.

661
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,090
The most likely person
behind the false accusation

662
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:26,330
is Secretary General Baek.

663
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:32,130
I won't make a gentlemen's
agreement with such a person.

664
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,385
Then, I can't help it.
I will break the

665
00:52:37,397 --> 00:52:40,790
agreement on the division
of party nominations.

666
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,830
You don't want

667
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,410
to do politics any more, do you?

668
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:55,650
In the future if the division of party
nominations between factions surfaces again

669
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,744
the list of names of
Anti-BH assemblymen who

670
00:52:57,756 --> 00:53:00,190
received a designer watch
from President Lee Taek Jo

671
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,510
will be distributed
to the media.

672
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,930
Secretary General Baek.

673
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,520
What's wrong with you?

674
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,610
Assemblywoman, I was scared! You
should have made some noise.

675
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,920
What should I do when the
door opened spontaneously?

676
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,920
Where and what have you
been doing all this time?

677
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,340
What do you mean? I was
hiding out and came back now.

678
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,395
You pretended to be all strong
but you were scared off

679
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:11,140
when you got a punch from
Secretary General Baek?

680
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,320
I had to pretend to be scared, so Secretary
General Baek would lower his guard.

681
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,060
Yes?

682
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,105
<i>KANG SANG HO: Assemblywoman Hong.
What became of the request for</i>

683
00:54:24,117 --> 00:54:26,900
<i>an audit of Hanmin Bank to the
Board of Audit and Inspection?</i>

684
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:32,100
<i>I can surely support you for the sake
of financial development in Korea.</i>

685
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,000
<i>Fighting!</i>

686
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,200
Secretary General Baek and
Anti-BH have become estranged.

687
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:44,000
Anti-BH seems to be using us in order
to attack Secretary General Baek.

688
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,628
How about it? Do you
realize the difference

689
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,340
of levels between Choi
In Kyung, you, and me?

690
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:52,810
Today, I acknowledge it.

691
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,230
Well. Let's start.

692
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,260
Okay. Follow me.

693
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,620
Pardon?

694
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,010
<i>The audit request for Hanmin
Bank to be audited by the Board</i>

695
00:55:03,022 --> 00:55:05,480
<i>of Audit and Inspection,
submitted by Assemblywoman Hong</i>

696

and the Anti-BH faction in Gookmin Party,</i>

<i>passed the National Assembly
Political Affairs Committee.</i>

698
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,948
<i>The audit request will come
to a vote at a plenary</i>

699
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,790
<i>session of the National
Assembly next week.</i>

700
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,849
<i>If passed, the Board of
Audit and Inspection</i>

701
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:20,610
<i>will conduct a
comprehensive audit of.</i>

702
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:25,220
<i>Hanmin Bank President Kim Doo Shik
and Hanmin Bank's overall business.</i>

00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,180
<i>Baek Do Hyeon.</i>

704
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:36,720
Baek Do Hyeon keeps calling us.

705
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,220
Listen to me carefully.

706
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,040
From now on, there is
absolutely no compromise.

707
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,680
Even if...

708
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,780
one of our arms or
legs is amputated

709
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:58,140
we will cut off Baek Do
Hyeon's neck this time.

710
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,570
What on earth did you do so far?

711
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,314
I will commit suicide by biting
my tongue here if we are

712
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:07,990
audited by the Board of Audit
and Inspection of Korea.

713
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,670
We will take care of it
before the plenary session.

714
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,110
I can't rely just on what you say.

715
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,010
Would you tell Secretary Baek to meet me?

716
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,290
No, I can't do it.<b>-<i> If you keep
acting this way, it will not be good.</i></b>

717
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,470
If I so choose, not only
you, Chief Secretary Im, but

718
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,310
don't you know Secretary General
Baek will also be done for?

719
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:25,210
Bank President Kim Doo Shik!<b>-
<i>I will not die by myself.</i></b>

720
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,570
Tell that to Secretary General Baek!

721
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,010
Hello? Hello?

722
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,090
What is it?

723
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,270
The guests from the Assembly came.

724
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,510
Who? Secretary General Baek?

725
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,590
Oh... Oh.

726
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:51,670
Our Assemblywoman Hong will explain
the Indifferent-to BH's perspective.

727
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:54,987
After passage of the request for
audit at the plenary session,

728
00:56:54,999 --> 00:56:58,380
will you be audited by the Board
of Audit under public scrutiny,

729
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,987
or will you reveal the
reason you made a false

730
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,480
accusation against
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil

731
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,380
and throw yourself upon the mercy of
the court and hope for a plea bargain?

732
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,420
Oh... oh... no.

733
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,280
Right now, what on earth
are you talking about?

734
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,260
Bank President, if you come clean,

735
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:16,280
we intend to submit a petition
requesting a reduction in your sentence.

736
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:22,300
We are not irresponsible,
unlike Secretary General Baek.

737
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,950
Oh, no.

738
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,770
Why are you guys here?

739
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,310
Move aside.

740
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,870
Hey, how do you speak informally
even though you are younger than me?

741
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,450
Won't you let me go? Let me go!

742
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:46,380
Hey!<b>- Chief Aide Im Gyu Tae.</b>

743
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,020
I received the flour you sent well.

744

Ah... I will deliver this as a present.

745
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,677
Befitting someone working in
the financial field, Bank.

746
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,760
President Kim was very meticulous
in taking care of business.

747
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,080
<i>Voice recording 0002:30.</i>

748
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,440
What is this?

749
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,160
Listen to this with Secretary General Baek.

750
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,800
Then, we will leave now because
of the press conference.

751
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:52,200
Reporters, I am telling you
this beforehand as a tip.

752
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:58,400
Call your news desks and tell them to
reserve the Front Page Top News sections.

753

00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,480

only one term between us.</i>

<i>your illegal lending of

758
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,880

764

<i>This is the fact, the truth.</i>

765

<i>Accordingly, Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's indictment based on perjury</i>

767
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,582
The prosecution must withdraw
the indictment and the court

768
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:08,530
must set Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil free immediately.
