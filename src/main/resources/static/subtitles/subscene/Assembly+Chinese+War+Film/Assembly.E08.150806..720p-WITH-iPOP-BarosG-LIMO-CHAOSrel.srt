names, and incidents</i>

<i>appearing in this drama
are fictitious creations.</i>

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,929
In a short time, a position at the
second level in the Secretary

4
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:12,260
General's office will be available.
Transfer to that position.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:20,120
If you and I are estranged further, we will
never be able to meet each other again.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,570
I don't want to lose you.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:29,500
No matter what, you are my
closest and oldest comrade.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,600
I am thankful for
your words, Sunbae.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
But while going through
this, I've made a decision.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,860
Decision?

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,070
Until the next election,
not as your aide,

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,410
but as Assemblyman Jin's
aide, I will remain.

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,800
I... want to make
him properly...

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,030
the next trustworthy assemblyman
from Gyeongjae City!

15
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:21,500
I don't know what potential
you discovered in him.

16
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,050
But it's all useless.

17
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,010
When you told me
to be his aide...

18
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,420
you cited Bismarck.

19
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,280
That politics is the
art of the possible.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,350
I, too, am a person who
believes in those words.

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,870
Do you really mean to
take a stand against me?

22
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,070
You may lose all the
political assets you have.

23
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,230
I am prepared to risk them.

24
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,610
What is it that you want
that makes you go this far?

25
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:03,130
That a next-generation leader of the
Republic of Korea called Baek Do Hyeon

26
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,490
does not fall
further from grace!

27
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,580
- What?<br>- While my body aids
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil,

28
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,760
my eyes will be watching
you, Sunbae-nim.

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,210
I will look forward to seeing your
dignified presence like the old days.

30
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you have the confidence
to win against me?

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,570
If I didn't, I would not even
have started this conversation.

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,080
Baek Do Hyeon as a sunbae and
Baek Do Hyun as an enemy...

33
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,980
are two very different
people, you will find out.

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,630
I will be on my guard.

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,370
Secretary General, I have brought
the papers you need to execute.

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,450
Secretary General?

37
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,950
Chief Secretary Lim.

38
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,960
Yes, Secretary General.

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,500
Let's start... with
Gyeongjae City.

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,080
Yes.

41

<i>Is Baek Seung Ro, the former

<i>of Home Affairs and famous for
his uprightness, your father?</i>

43
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,860
<i>Yes, when my father was the
appointed Mayor of Gyeongjae City,</i>

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,520
<i>I was born in his old age.</i>

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,310
<i>Wasn't your place
of birth Seoul?</i>

46
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,590
<i>Ah... A month after I was born, my father
was transferred to a post in Seoul―</i>

47
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,660
<i>During that process, my place of birth was
wrongly recorded in the family register.</i>

48
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,010
<i>But the exact place
where I was born was</i>

49
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,600
<i>Gyeongjae City, Hae

54
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,920
<i>With Secretary General Baek...</i>

55
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,900
Have you known that Secretary General
Baek was born in Gyeongjae City?

56
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,150
Please come out to the
secretaries' area.

57
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,100
What? She isn't even answering.

58
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,430
She thinks she's
all that, really!

<i>Episode 8</i>

60
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,890
Why do you ask a person
to come and go again...?

61
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,260
What is that?

62
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,680
Are we going somewhere?

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,840
What is this, now?

64
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,100
It's a weapon to fight
and beat the hit list.

65
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
What weapon?

66
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Over 50% of Korean voters do not know the
names of their districts' assemblymen.

67
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,735
Even if they do, the number
of people supporting

68
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:41,360
that particular assemblyman
is half of that 50%.

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,588
That means there are very few
assemblymen with more than

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
50% recognition and 25% support
in their constituencies.

71
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,540
Why do you make me study arithmetic
at the beginning of the day?

72
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,210
Assemblyman, from now on, unless
some natural disaster strikes,

73
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,480
from Friday evening to early
Monday morning, and during

74
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:57,530
off-seasons, Monday through
Sunday, all week long,

75
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,810
you have to do things in Gyeongjae
City, your constituency.

76
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,044
Every Monday, as to whether
the soles of these

77
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,340
sneakers have been all
worn down or not...

78
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,720
you will need to
get my evaluation.

79
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,230
Are you kidding?

80
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,750
Rubber, these days, is so solid
and how can I, in a week...

81
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,370
Do you think you can win the people's
hearts without doing at least this much?

82
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,820
That is true.

83
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,870
Even to win one woman's heart, one
has to go through hell and back.

84
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,470
To win so many
people's hearts...

85
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,570
Of course we should do it.

86
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,230
Go into the district and
meet the local residents.

87
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,700
Engage them in conversations and
watch how they live day-to-day.

88
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,350
That is the first and foremost duty
an assemblyman should undertake.

89
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,370
Yes, well, I can do it
riding this, right?

90
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,020

road a bit and...

Aigoo, so thankful that
he even visited...

103

- We have to wait an hour.<br>-
It's very inconvenient.

104
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,070
It is very
inconvenient, that is!

105
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,030

<i>Reduce Bus Waiting

107
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,020

- Do not worry.<br>
- Excuse me Assemblyman, instead

109
00:07:44,162 --> 00:07:45,940
of doing that, why don't
you sing us a song?

<i>Changes in Support for

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,338
I guess he is trying
to woo the so-called

124
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,320
three major groups of
an electoral district.

125
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,400
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's recognition
that stayed at a low 10% range,

126

also rising rapidly.

Because it's my hometown?

No, I am just back from
the fortune teller's shop

135
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,990
that Supreme Councilman
Park introduced me to.

136
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,848
It was a male shaman possessed by a
little lad ghost and he is known as

137
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,610
"tweezers" (EXTREMELY ACCURATE),
specializing in the political arena.

138
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,718
When I told him the four pillars
of your destiny (year, month,

139
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,750
day and hour of one's birth
creating that person's destiny),

140
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,640
southeasterly, he said in the southeasterly
direction lies your deliverer.

141
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,280
Assemblywomen Hong, you even knew
the date and hour of my birth?

142
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,790
What is this?

143
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,830
It's an election charm.

144
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,610
That is...

145
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,180
He said he'd give me a discount
if I bought a set (A PAIR).

146
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,620
- A set?<br>- He said you must
keep it in your underpants.

147
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,740

How can you personally
think of making a bridge?

154
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,790
Right?

155
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,090
Was that really our
assemblyman's sincerity?

156
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,650
What?

157
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,750
Yes, Assemblyman.
<br> One moment please.

158
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,290
How come you hide the complaints
received from the voters?

159
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,570
I told you to give it to me,
as soon as you receive it.

160
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,670
I forgot it.

161
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,750
Because I have a small head (GOOD BODY
PROPORTIONS), its capacity is a bit low.

162
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,250
Where did you say you left it?

163
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,690
I probably left it
somewhere on the desk.

164
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,092
I will hang up now. I need
to spray insecticide on

165

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,490
A watch?

170
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,888
Oh, right! I received a
commemorative item or something

171
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,310
at the forum where Secretary
General Baek gave a speech.

172
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,110
<i> Why?</i>

173
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,710
- A commemorative item? <br> - Yes.
Then I gave it to Secretary Kim.

174
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,050
Secretary Kim Gyu Hwan?

175
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,150
Yes, but why are you
asking about that?

176
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,470
<i>Are you sulky because I
didn't give it to you?</i>

177
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,810
Hello?

178
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,010
What is this clueless talking?

179
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,270
Kim Gyu Hwan, are you
still not done yet?

180
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,790
Yes. I am almost done.

181
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,330
Hurry up, will you?

182
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,970
When I was an intern, I would've already
been kicked in the shin several times.

183
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,690
Yes.

184
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,490
What?

185
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,350
Kim Gyu Hwan, see me for a bit.

186
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,330
Did I make some sort
of mistake, again?

187
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,690
Why this is in the
assemblyman's drawer,

188
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,650
explain it.

189
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,030
Assemblyman gave it to me.

190
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,327
Opening this, I found
it seemed an expensive

191
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:03,270
brand. So I thought
I couldn't wear it.

192
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,790
Then, is it okay for
Assemblyman to wear it?

193
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,430
Pardon?

194
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,550
If, by a one-in-ten-thousand chance, this
gets leaked outside, what will happen?

195
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,190
Whether all the elements of the
crime of bribery are there or not,

196
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,250
Assemblyman will be the target
of distrust and criticism.

197
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,910
Furthermore, in some cases, he might end up
lined up against the police mug shot wall.

198
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,410
Since you studied to be a
policeman, you at least know that.

199
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,910
I didn't think that far ahead.

200
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,610
Okay.

201
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,442
Let's say it's okay to not tell me.
But what's

202
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:40,030
the reason for not
telling Assemblyman?

203
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,550
I am sorry, I forgot.

204
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,750
Are you using that
as an excuse now?

205
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,970
Nothing like this
will happen again.

206
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,410
Clock out from work right now.

207
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,760
Until you're contacted,
you're off work.

208
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,670
It's okay for you to
seek another job.

209
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,510
Aide!

210
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,350
Secretary Kim will take a few days off with
a personal matter. Please understand that.

211
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,150
Madame Aide!

212
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,990
Then what was I supposed to do?

213
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,850
- Kim Gyu Hwan. <br> - I...

214
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,730
I did not forget but I did
not report it on purpose.

215
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,430
Why?

216
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,950
When Assemblyman sees that, he
may want me to avert my eyes.

217
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,970
See that, what does that mean?

218
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,150
How come?!

219
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,190
Because it's a ₩
5,000,000 watch.

220
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,550
If Assemblyman also knows that
it is not a commemorative watch,

221
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,010
he will surely want to wear it.

222
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,750
You...

223
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,550
What do you know about our assemblyman
that you are spewing such words?

224
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,530
Madame Aide!

225
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,810
How well do you know our
assemblyman to say that?

226
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,010
Secretary Kim, what
is wrong with you?

227
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,750
Leave!

228
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,730
Leave right now!

229
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,390
Secretary Kim, just
say you're sorry.

230
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,370
Secretary Kim.

231
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,390
Wow, what rudeness!

232
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,030
Aigoo. What does it look like
for everyone to act like this?

233
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,830
One moment.

234
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,950
Give it to me.

235
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,890
I accepted this?

236
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,770
Yes. When someone offers you
something, don't be like a kid

237
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,810
and take everything!

238
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,430
There is no one who hands out favors
to assemblymen without a reason.

239
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,670
Wow! This watch is splendid!

240
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,410
So, Secretary Kim didn't wear this
and tried to give this to me, right?

241
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,410
That is what I said.

242
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,870
I thought this punk is good
only at the martial arts.

243
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,630
He also has a good
human character.

244
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,490
Give it to me. I will
return it to President Lee.

245
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,730
It's okay. The punk who
received it must return it.

246
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,990
<i>I want to tip you off about</i>

247
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,070
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's
acceptance of an illegal bribe.</i>

248
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,070
Who is it?

249
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,050
Are you surprised?

250
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,310
Assemblyman?

251
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,070
Wow! Cleaner than I expected!

252
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,590
What were you doing?

253
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,850
What? Did you see
something flashy?

254
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,110
How did you know to come here?

255
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,070
You... are a little tight...
with money...

256
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,730
by paying rent on
this room and living.

257
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,550
What brings you here?

258
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,350
This.

259
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,170
Since we received this together, we
have to take care of this together.

260
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:45,410
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

261
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:52,934
Subtitles ripped by bozxphd

262
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,470
Here.

263
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,030
By the way, is it really
okay to do things this way?

264
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,890
What will happen if we return it? It
will end up in someone's pocket, anyhow.

265
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,750
Hey, you! According
to the Aides,

266
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,210
you barely considered me as
an assemblyman all this time?

267
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,550
Is it not okay if I do that?

268
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,830
Is it not okay?

269
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,410
Since you got fired, your
attitude has completely changed.

270
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,010
I will be leaving first.

271
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,250
Where are you going while
an elder is speaking?

272
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,250
- Let me go, please!
<br>- Look at these eagle eyes!

273
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,710
If I don't let go, you are
about to hit me again.

274
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,870
I told you to let me go.

275
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,910
They say you should make
hay while the sun shines.

276
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,150
How about finishing up the
fight from the last time?

277
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,170
Since I came this far and
gave up everything, why not?

278
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,690
Aicham! There is a
cute side of him.

279
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,420
Come to work from tomorrow.

280
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,860
What?

281
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,140
You are lucky that Aide Choi
is generously minded, but

282
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,010
if you get into trouble with Aide Choi
again, I will fight with you head to head.

283
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,860
Why? You don't want to?

284
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,400
Your pride hurts?

285
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,970
Hey, where are you going?

286
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,740
Secretary Kim.

287
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,010
Hey, you punk!

288
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,530
Your swings are alive.

289
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,850
So full of energy!

290
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,510
Oh, wow...

291
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,690
By the way, have you heard?

292
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,400
Baek Do Hyeon appeared
on TV and said

293
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,470
that his hometown was not
Seoul, but Gyeongjae City.

294
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,580
Gyeongjae City?

295
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,980
Yes! Don't you think Secretary General Baek
has a thought of running in Gyeongjae City?

296
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,962
By the way, is it okay to
procrastinate like this without

297
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:23,800
doing the maintenance work
in your constituency?

298
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,220
A company where the CEO is
busy is not much of a company.

299
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,870
The CEO only needs to
maintain the executives well.

300
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,813
Aigo, let me ask you. Who
in the world are the

301
00:21:34,825 --> 00:21:38,200
executives of the Park Choon
Seob Incorporated Company?

302
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,620
- Those people. <br>- What?

303
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,667
Local administrative agency
directors, heads of social

304
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,770
and commercial gatherings,
alumni association heads...

305
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,220
I am talking about the
influential people in the area.

306
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,390
That is that, but the votes from deep
down the hierarchy are also important.

307
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,570
Doing things this way, you will
end up paying dearly for it.

308
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,350
Votes from the bottom layer are
important, but they are so fickle.

309
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:09,990
After 4 years of devotion, one wind
and they drop like the autumn leaves.

310
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,130
But the big shots' opinions
have a single theme.

311
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,350
What do you mean one theme?

312
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,960
Development of the area where they
live, farting their influence.

313
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,270
So, by when will you give it to me?
Should I keep waiting, huh?

314
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,300
Why are you on the phone so long? What
happened to what I asked you about?

315
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,400
Oh, and Secretary Oh, I think something
is left out of this. Check this properly.

316
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,200
Ah, yes, yes, that day, he
has a meeting scheduled...

317
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,750
<i>Changes in Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's
Approval Rates in Gyeongjae City (%)</i>

318
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,350
Everyone, listen up.

319
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,540
Compared to the last month,
about our assemblyman,

320
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,690
Gyeongjae citizens' recognition and support
rates have, each by 10% and 12%...

321
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,030
increased!

322
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,130
Wow, jackpot, jackpot!

323
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,450
Great!

324
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,120
- Aide,<br>- Yes?

325
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,990
A fax came in.

326
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,570
<i>Notice<br>We request an emergency
meeting as follows.</i>

327

329
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,790
Aigoo, why?

330
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,000
I think you have to hurry and
go down to Gyeongjae City.

331
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,920
Is anything up?

332
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,306
There is a campaign promise
that the former Assemblyman

333
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,790
Yang Sung Gil dumped out there
about a development project.

334
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,090
It's about attracting a new
harbor in Gyeongjae City

335
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:09,360
and developing a hub harbor
in the southeast region.

336
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,400
The Support Committee has requested
an emergency meeting with the Mayor.

337
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,050
Support Committee?

338
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,770
It's a group of all the influential
people in the community.

339
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:22,420
Each of those people can move from several
dozen to several hundred voters' opinions.

340
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,750
You must attend it, Assemblyman.

341
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,640
Oh, of course I should.
Let's go, let's go quickly.

342
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,776
Mayor, at this rate, it
will take a millennium

343
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:33,200
before the new harbor
is built here.

344
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,000
How many years on earth have
you been dragging this out?

345
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,780
We are trying in 100
different ways, but

346
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,080
it's not easy because the central
government is pretty passive about this

347
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,980
and there are too many green-belt
areas in our jurisdiction.

348
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,500
That belt thing... shouldn't
you be unbuckling it for us?

349
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,800
Yes, I should unbuckle it for you...
I will try very hard.

350
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,560
Would trying be enough? Give us
some result within this year.

351
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,840
Next year is the
election, election!

352
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,140
Yes, I... will do my best
and try very hard, anyhow.

353
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,110
Ah, yes.

354
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,050
In the past, with Yang Sung Gil, I was
on very good terms, like friends.

355
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,070
Privately, I can use informal
speech with you, right?

356
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,760
Ahew, of course, you are...
older than me.

357
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,930
Don't hesitate and just tell me if you
need money to manage the constituency.

358
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,520
No, I am a hands-on type. Thank
you for offering, though.

359
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,283
I am a person who controls
at least 300 votes, with

360
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:50,750
my company employees and
get-together members.

361
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,550
Oh, yes... 300 votes?

362
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,810
I will give my son's
resume to your aide.

363
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,450
Please look into a special position
at a conglomerate company.

364
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,350
<i>Resume</i>

365
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,080
It is okay to rip it?

366
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,780
Yes, rip it to shreds.

367
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,520
But didn't you say
this was a 300-voter?

368
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,240
You can assume it's one-tenth
of the number he called out.

369
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,200
I will buy you another pair of sneakers, so
just meet another 30 workers at a company.

370
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,640
But this time, please
buy me a known brand.

371
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,850
Wherever you go, you'll come
across people like that.

372
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:43,550
And they are the main culprits
corrupting healthy political minds.

373
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,510
By the way,

374
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,560
weren't the Support Committee
people totally pigheaded?

375
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,653
It's not even building ships
at a shipyard, but they want

376
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:55,610
the right to build a whole
new harbor within this year.

377
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,750
Does that make any sense?

378
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,480
It's not their fault. It's
the fault of the politicians

379
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,238
who have, without sufficient review,
just because it would help with

380
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,020
their election, whetted the residents'
appetite for more development.

381
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,360
But why were they staying quiet all this
time and bringing it up like this only now?

382
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,749
Next year's the election, you know?
They judged that this

383
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:14,080
would be the time when their
words would hold most sway.

384
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,020
Then, what do I have to do now?

385
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,800
It's not an easy matter. You have
to give it a serious evaluation.

386
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,720
Wow, that is really...

387
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,930
the phrase I abhor the most.

388
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,080
Serious evaluation. Aide Choi,
you are no different...

389
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,000
Assemblyman!

390
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,490
But, Aide Choi,

391
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:44,020
Secretary Kim... won't he
ever come back to work?

392
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,200
He's not coming?

393
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,750
Are you really just going to play
around because it's vacation time?

394
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,300
- Should I go to the
National Assembly?<br>- What?

395
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,060
Yes, this is Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil's Office.

396
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,480
<i>By any chance, is Secretary
Kim Gyu Hwan available?</i>

397
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,050
What?

398
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,400
He no longer works here.

399
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,210
If you're going to go to the Assembly
Hall, give this to Aunt Ae Ri.

400
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,280
I borrowed it from her the last time.
If you tell her that, she will know.

401
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,800
I'm going to sleep.

402
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,510
Why is that kid like that?

403
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,430
<i>Consequently, I do
not bear any...</i>

404
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,610
<i>legal or moral responsibility
for his death.</i>

405
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:17,060
<i>My aide says that an assemblyman
is the people's servant.</i>

406
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,750
Can you hear what
they're saying?

407
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,180
Shhh!

408
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,690
You still want to work?

409
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,170
Yes.

410
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,570
Why were you playing
hard to get before?

411
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,410
Huh?

412
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,310
After not working for a few days,
does your future look bleak?

413
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:03,270
I needed some time to
organize my thoughts again.

414
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,390
What do you think, Aide Choi?

415
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:12,350
I will leave it up
to you, Assemblyman.

416
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,790
How much do you pay for
your room every month?

417
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:18,150
$400.

418
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,290
400?

419
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:24,170
Then, after paying 400 from your internship
allowance, you won't have much left.

420
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,410
Go home and pack your stuff.

421
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,610
- What?<br>- I said pack
your stuff, punk.

422
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:39,250
<i>♬ Making passes, passes, passes,
you must fall asleep. ♬</i>

423
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,730
<i>♬ Now, I'm tired, bumblebee. Bumblebee!
I'm tired of waiting, ♬</i>

424
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,430
<i>♬ bumblebee. Bumblebee! ♬</i><br>- What?
- Nothing.

425
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:51,710
<i>♬ Alone, this night is so, so cold.
♬<i><br>♬ Bumblebee! ♬</i></i>

426
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,690
<i>♬ You're incorrigible, bumblebee.
♬</i> <br>Sing with me. ♬ Bumblebee! ♬

427
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,010
<i>♬ You're a bumblebee that makes me cry.
♬</i><br>♬ Bumblebee... ♬

428
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:03,450
<i>♬ Alone, this night
is so, so long. ♬</i>

429
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,470
Your belongings are rather few.

430
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,190
Aide.

431
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,930
Come out.

432
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,427
Instead of Secretary Byeon who likes
to sleep in in the morning, you

433
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,370
wake up the assemblyman and take
care of his breakfast and commute.

434
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,490
With that condition, I
agreed to let you stay here.

435
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,970
Okay. And Aide...

436
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,410
I really was sorry.

437
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,550
Thank the Assemblyman.

438
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,037
Since he was fired from
his past job, he said

439
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,330
how can he fire his
staff and threw a fit.

440
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,830
I really was going to fire you.

441
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,990
Okay, I understand.

442
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,070
Because I can see, I know you
are diligent most of time.

443
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,130
And because of that, when I see
you, I get a bit emotional.

444
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,850
-What?<br>-In the
political field,

445
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,970
for a kid like you,
it's easy to get hurt.

446
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,930
It's because everybody looks for
results and not one's diligence.

447
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,930
Nobody pays any attention to
someone who tried and failed.

448
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,870
Isn't the world
basically like that?

449
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,910
Because I have experienced
it lots of times,

450
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,050
I no longer get hurt by it.

451
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,450
When you were arguing
with me a while ago,

452
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,490
you asked me just what I knew
about the assemblyman, right?

453
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,030
Yes.

454
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:49,290
What you said was right. How
much can I know about him?

455
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,370
However, I had this thought.

456
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,210
That if I tried something with
that assemblyman and failed,

457
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,890
I wasn't going to get hurt.

458
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:07,710
I wish for you to find
that side of him quickly.

459
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,710
That's why I returned.

460
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,665
The assemblyman that I'm
thinking about as compared

461
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:21,450
to the assemblyman that
you are thinking about:

462
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,970
which assemblyman is
the correct one...

463
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:28,190
I had thoughts about wanting
to confirm which one.

464
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,830
The reason is rather strange but

465
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,130
it's a good phenomenon for a staff member
to start getting interested in his leader.

466
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,670
- Yes.<br>- I'm leaving.

467
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,470
Goodbye.

468
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,830
The campaign to attract a new harbor
to Gyeongjae City is getting heated.

469
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:57,810
They are supposed to launch a full-scale
campaign including large rallies very soon.

470
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,470
Then, you're saying there has
been no progress all this time.

471
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,570
No, you can't say no progress.

472
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,030
We are talking with the government
based on these documents.

473
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,770
And there are a few big problems.
One is...

474
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,330
the law has to be changed...

475
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,338
In order to do that, the
government says they

476
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,150
have to hold meetings
amongst themselves.

477
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:27,390
They are trying to drag this
out and just pass over this.

478
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,970
How can you just sit
there and watch it?

479
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:33,710
Assemblyman Jin, do you even have the will
to attract a new harbor infrastructure?

480
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,250
Oh, of course. We're trying
to enrich our village, right?

481
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,350
Isn't this what we
are trying to do?

482
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,595
Never mind the will,
we have to get this

483
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,030
done, no matter what.
That's what I think...

484
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:48,070
But the former Assemblyman
Yang Sung Gil...actually

485
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,770
did plan to get too big of a
budget, I think that is true.

486
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,970
That problem is...

487
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,610
Those people are
on edge right now.

488
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,410
How many times have I told you that you
cannot give them a passive impression?

489
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,990
It's not because I'm passive but
I feel uneasy, as if I'm lying.

490
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,750
Let's just give
it to them as is.

491
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,330
What do you mean as is?

492
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,065
Considering our Gyeongjae
City's financials, a

493
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:08,750
big harbor like that
does not make any sense.

494
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,330
We can tell them that, if we are
lucky, we can get them a small dock.

495
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,730
That was all former Assemblyman Yang Sung
Gil's hot air to the Gyeongjae citizens.

496
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,750
Can't you see that you will end
up a traitor, talking like that?

497
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,650
Wow, I, really...

498
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,630
We are not yet at the stage where the
next best thing should be mentioned.

499
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,410
Yes, Sunbae-nim!

500
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,358
I heard that you
clad Jin Sang Pil in

501
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,150
sneakers and are making
him sweep the floor.

502
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,590
Is that wrong?

503
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,850
I cranked up my
brain assiduously.

504
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:50,030
Do Hyeon's next electoral district!
It's Gyeongjae City.

505
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,670
- Surprised, right?<br>-
Omo, really...

506
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,490
Really! So quickly
tender your resignation

507
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,110
and run into Do Hyeon's bosom.

508
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,870
Don't forget to leave some
water marks under your eyes.

509
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,310
Since things played
out this way, anyway,

510
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:09,050
I'm thinking of going all-in
for Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

511
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,310
This is why your
business tanked.

512
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:14,530
Is Jin Sang Pil even a
match for Do Hyeon?

513
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,470
Don't you think he has a
possibility with my help?

514
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,070
Do Hyeon also has
one on his side.

515
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,130
- His father?<br>- Bingo!

516
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,710
The first appointed mayor
of Gyeongjae City.

517
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,210
<i>Hello.</i>

518
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,130
This is Do Hyeon.

519
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,830
Yes.

520
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,970
I am sorry, but
this time, Father,

521
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:57,810
I need your help. Yes.

Okay, please do not let
this happen ever again.

535
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,210
Those people, what do they take an
incumbent local assemblyman for?

536
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,923
What more would they
need when they have

537
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,870
Secretary General Baek's
father on their back?

538
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,030
Be quiet!

539
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,590
Aide Choi, I don't have a
good feeling about this.

540
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,374
As soon as it is known
that Secretary General

541
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:01,830
Baek's birth place
is Gyeongjae City,

542
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,550
his father puts down stakes.

543
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:09,830
Secretary General Baek... isn't he, by any
chance, planning to run in Gyeongjae City?

544
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,270
This afternoon, for Standing
Advisor Baek Seung Ro

545
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,530
they are holding a ceremony to
deliver the appointment letter.

546
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,990
What do you think, Aide Choi?

547
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,810
- What?<br>- Secretary General
Baek is, right now...

548
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,170
greedily eyeing
Gyeongjae City, right?

549
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,890
From Secretary General
Baek's point of view...

550
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,570
there is no place that
he would not be eyeing.

551
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,490
Don't get tense before the
fact and Assemblyman, you

552
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,710
can continue as you
have done so far.

00:38:57,074 --> 00:38:58,710
to secure a new harbor
infrastructure,

556
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,630

559
00:39:23,482 --> 00:39:26,370
who will work hard to attract the
new harbor to Gyeongjae City,

560
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:29,310
which is everyone's
long cherished wish,

561
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:34,690
I will end my greeting message.

562
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,070
It's Secretary General
Baek Do Hyeon!

563
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,550
Right now, the Standing
Advisor's son,

564
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,710
Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon
has graced us with his visit!

565
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:45,010
Please give him a big
round of applause!

What brings you here?

569
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,204
My father has taken
on an important

00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:13,860
function.<br>Of course I,
his son, should come.

571
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,060
Oh, yes... welcome...

572
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,280
Nice to meet you, everyone. I am Gookmin
Party's Secretary General, Baek Do Hyeon.

573
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,450
Not forgetting my father,

574
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,280
for entrusting this glorious duty.
Citizens of Gyeonjae,

575
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,900
I would really
like to thank you.

576
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,060
Since I am a Secretary General
who does the will of the Party,

577
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,280
I don't think I can
be of great help.

578
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:54,700
However, I believe the respected
Assemblyman Jin will be of great help.

579
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,850
In any event, I
sincerely hope that

580
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,100
the place of my birth will become a
leader in the economic development

581
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,720
of the southeast region.

582
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,600
Thank you.

583
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:30,900
Baek Do Hyeon!

584
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:38,470
Gyeongjae City!

585
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,940
Please, go up now.

586
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,970
I'm sorry but I have some matters
to take care of in Seoul.

587
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,610
After seeing you,
I feel energized!

588
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,930
From now on, we'll really
be supportive of you.

589
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,980
- Oh, thank you.
<br>- Be safe on your way.

590
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,060
Mayor, bye.

591
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,910
Then, I apologize. Bye.

592
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,550
What are you doing now?

593
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,880
What's your problem?

594
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,060
The thing that you are
doing, Secretary General,

595
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,640
you seem like a guy who is looking
for land to build your house.

596
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,720
Are you afraid that I might
run for office here?

597
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,050
No, it's not that I am afraid.

598
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,580
You just look pathetic.
I feel pity for you.

599
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,310
For a person who
is heavy-weight...

600
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,380
When you were sitting during the meeting,
what do you think you looked like?

601
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,740
Looked like what?

602
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:46,070
As for me, I will go
anywhere that needs me.

603
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,810
Unless the people of Gyeongjae call,
I won't have a reason to come here.

604
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,010
Everything will depend on
what you do, Assemblyman.

605
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,630
Wow! With words, I don't
think I can beat him.

606
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,860
You win.

607
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,520
There is talk of you running in Gyeongjae.
What are your thoughts?

608
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,985
Since I haven't declared
to run in a district,

609
00:43:14,997 --> 00:43:17,000
I think there will
be a lot of rumors.

610
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,680
Then, are you saying that you have no
intention of running in this district?

611
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,250
That subject will depend on the people
of Gyeongjae rather than what I think.

612
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,045
-Excuse me, we have to
finish the interview right

613
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:27,190
here.<br><i>-Can you give us more
details about what you said?</i>

614
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:32,340
If things work out well for you, you
have to treat me to something big.

615
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:37,150
I gave you the decisive hint.
Southeasterly direction.

616
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,170
I understand, I will treat you.

617
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,550
But a formal declaration of running
there... that would be too much, right?

618
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,387
Since there is an incumbent
Assemblyman from the

619
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:49,210
same party in the district,
I shouldn't do that.

620
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,090
I can look foolish.

621
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,193
Even though the opponent is
only Assemblyman Jin, still

622
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:55,320
you cannot ignore the advantages
he has as an incumbent.

623
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,140
It's better to uproot him
while the wind is blowing.

624
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,090
In politics, backlash is
scarier than a hurricane.

625
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,970
Since I met a good wind,
there is no reason to row.

626
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:17,750
Seeing how you are relaxed, I guess
you still have a hidden card.

Whether Secretary General Baek
runs in Gyeongjae City or not...

646
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,070
depends on how the
Support Committee moves.

just put in extra work for a few days.

is Secretary General Baek.

much on our assemblyman's side?

00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,250
for the sake of the unity
and stability of his party,

669
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,890
with an attitude of
someone who sacrifices

670
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,730
his personal gains for
the party's benefit.

671
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,750
Moreover, we are so proud that

672
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:29,250
he is Gyeongjae City's
son who was born here.

673
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,450
We, the Come Baek Home
members, sincerely wish that

674
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,680
Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon will
come back to Gyeongjae City.

675
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,250
For Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon

676
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,610
to achieve a bigger dream
in Gyeongjae City,

677
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:49,150
we will do our best.
That is all.

678
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:56,050
Those punks are saying that Baek
Do Hyeon should run here, right?

679
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,340
<i>Unless the people of Gyeongjae call,
I won't have a reason to come here.</i>

680
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,580
I guess I'll have to run head
to head against Baek Do Hyeon.

681
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,550
The Support Committee
to attract a new harbor

682
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,930
has changed into a support committee
to attract Baek Do Hyeon.

683
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,630
Practically without lifting a
finger, he has turned all the

684
00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:19,490
influential people of Gyeongjae
City into his loyal bodyguards.

685
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,070
I think I hear Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil's wailing even from here.

686
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,170
Looking at this
guy, Baek Do Hyeon,

687
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,101
I think he was born with
excellent political

688
00:48:31,113 --> 00:48:32,970
luck (FATED TO REACH
HIGH POLITICAL POSTS).

689
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,200
But somehow, when he
abandoned his own district,

690
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,610
a new district appeared that welcomed
him with both arms wide open

691
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,750
at Gyeongjae, the place he
says that he was born in.

692
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,380
Assemblyman Kang...

693
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,160
do you think that's
a coincidence?

694
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,360
The person who has declared to run
in Baek Do Hyeon's constituency,

695
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,270
is Oh Sae Chang.

696
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:01,270
Is it the Oh Sae Chang who is known
as the "burglarizer of empty houses?"

697
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:06,830
What if it wasn't burglarizing an
empty house? What if the owner...

698
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,030
ran away in advance knowing that a robber
was going to show up at his house?

699
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:18,490
Then, Baek Do Hyeon

700
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:24,950
already knew in advance that Oh Sae Chang
was going to run in his district?!

701
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:33,250
<i>What is the reason for being so
fixated with Gyeonjae district?</i>

702
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,820
<i>At most his term will be 1 year and
he's only a half-term assemblyman.</i>

703
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,560
<i>Because it's not like you to
force a guy like Jin Sang Pil.</i>

704
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,340
<i>That's why I am asking you.</i>

705
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,830
Baek Do Hyeon...

706
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,760
from that moment,
had his mind set...

707
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,600
on moving far away.

708
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,810
Moving?

709
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,570
Yes, Assemblyman Park.

710
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:23,760
By you, Secretary General
Baek, all this time...

711
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,210
I was completely fooled.

712
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:29,500
What are you talking about?

713
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,038
From the time that you gave
the nomination to Assemblyman

714
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,600
Jin, you were going to use him
for a year and discard him.

715
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,280
I didn't even know and

716
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,350
I asked you to omit Assemblyman Jin
from the next round of nominations.

717
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:43,790
-Assemblyman Park.<br>-I do
understand to some degree.

718
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,530
Who in the Gookmin
Party would want

719
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,890
to go up against Oh Sae Chang
in the Seoul metropolitan area?

720
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,200
I will

721
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,750
give you some advice.

722
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:57,900
Go ahead.

723
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,020
I was in nine elections and

724
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,640
lost four times.

725
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,130
Do you know why I was able to
last a long time as a politician?

726
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,240
I don't know.

727
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,730
It's because I am not
afraid of losing.

728
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,570
But it seems like you
really dislike losing.

729
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,410
As for me, I have never
lost in my life.

730
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,190
If that's the case, you
can't last as a politician.

731
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,670
The real winner is
made by defeats.

732
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,100
Are you done with
giving your advice?

733
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,670
Your choice this time,
Secretary General Baek,

734
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,950
will come back to
bite you someday.

735
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:58,880
Assemblyman, where
are you coming from?

736
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,490
I think I can get
there in an hour.

737
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:05,120
Okay, while you are on your way,

738
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,930
I will wait with a few
options drawn up.

739
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:20,720
Sang Pil, if we go against
Secretary General Baek,

740
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,990
what is going to
happen to Aide Choi?

741
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,390
Does she have to quit?

742
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:28,100
Stop saying those
useless things.

743
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:41,570
- Hello?<br><i>- Assemblyman Jin,
it's me, the Anti-BH Avatar.</i>

744
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,450
What is the matter, Assemblyman?

745
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:49,980
-What is the
matter?<br>-Assemblyman Jin.

746
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:55,690
It's not like we're kids; we are
politicians who maintain politics.

747
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,090
We should live, making
amends with each other.

748
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:03,340
Oh, yes. I apologize
for that time.

749
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,510
What do you mean apologize?
Please sit.

750
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,460
How are you doing? It's
really taxing, isn't it?

751
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,760
No, it's just...a bit.

752
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:24,080
In regards to Secretary
General Baek,

753
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,880
he shouldn't act this way when you
consider political etiquette.

754
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,949
How can he try to take
away the district from

755
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:33,640
a person that he gave
the nomination to?

756
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,030
He must have done it because he
was having a hard time, I guess.

757
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,990
Assemblyman Jin,
you were fooled.

758
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,700
What?

759
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,341
You know Oh Sae Chang,
of the Korean Democratic

760
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,320
Party's non-mainstream
faction fame?

761
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,680
Because that person will run in Secretary
General Baek's current constituency,

762
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,720
having found out about this
beforehand, Secretary General Baek

763
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,660
gave you the nomination
for Gyeongjae City.

764
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,430
So because of Oh Sae Chang...

765
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,260
he nominated me?

766
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,240
Oh Sae Chang is considered a
presidential-level candidate.

767
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,890
If the two run against
each other next year,

768
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,870
Secretary General Baek
will get beaten, no doubt.

769
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:14,530
So, after making a pushover
hold the place for him

770
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,150
in Gyeongjae City where
he supposedly was born,

771
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,870
he intended to take
it back afterwards.

772
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,070
What are you talking about?

773
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:31,060
Assemblyman Jin, look at
the situation around you.

774
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,270
Without an elaborate script,

775
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,610
things cannot play out
like clockwork like this.

776
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,470
Assemblyman, you have
been completely conned.

777
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:46,890
When you have thought it
over, come to see me.

778
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,960
Our Anti-BH faction
will help you.

779
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,316
<i>I am hoping that, Chairman,
you will go to the</i>

780
00:55:03,328 --> 00:55:05,360
<i>National Assembly and engage
in legislative activities</i>

781
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,301
<i>not only for the unemployed
but also for all</i>

782
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:09,180
<i>the underprivileged
members of our society.</i>

783
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:17,420
<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!
Jin Sang Pil!</i>

784
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:26,440
Baek Do Hyeon! Baek Do Hyeon!

785
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:59,240
He said he would see someone briefly
and come back to the office, for sure.

786
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,980
Yes.

787
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,860
Aish, seriously...

788
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,160
Yes Sunbae-nim.

789
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,860
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

790
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,830
Okay.

791
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,430
I will go outside for a moment.

792
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:33,520
Don't you think Aide Choi
is a bit suspicious?

793
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,280
What?

794
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,180
Very suspicious...

795
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,490
Who's this?

796
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:51,310
Since we met, do
you want to talk?

797
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:52,910
I'm a bit busy.

798
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,110
I don't have the presence
of mind to banter with you.

799
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,810
Hold on.

800
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,850
What do you want to say?

801
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:11,090
Let me just ask why on
earth you are so busy.

802
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:15,600
- What?<br>- Is it for Assemblyman Jin
or for Secretary General Baek?

803
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,600
I'm curious as to your
intent behind this question?

804
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,980
As far as I know, Choi In
Kyung, you are our family.

805
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,199
But if you're acting for
the sake of Assemblyman

806
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:25,850
Jin, then that would
be treacherous.

807
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,565
And if it's for the sake
of Secretary General

808
00:57:28,577 --> 00:57:30,590
Baek, then I guess that
would make me a mole?

809
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:35,690
Right. Between a traitor and
a mole, which one are you?

810
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,250
-Secretary Lee.<br>-Yes?

811
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:40,610
-Cover your ears.<br>-Y...yes.

812
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,670
- What are you doing?<br>-
Hey, Hong Chan Mi!

813
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,410
What? Hey?

814
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,970
I am neither a
traitor nor a mole.

815
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:49,640
I'm just Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's
aide, Choi In Kyung, got that?!

816
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,840
Right, how dare a mere aide
talk down to an assemblywoman!

817
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,650
If you act cocky one more
time, when they were

818
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:55,600
ranking the proportional
representative candidates

819
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,594
you sought me out and begged
me, crying and sniffling,

820
00:57:57,606 --> 00:57:59,430
to schedule a meeting with
Secretary General Baek.

821
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,730
I'm going to distribute
flyers about that episode!

822
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,151
I kept holding it in and
holding it in, and do you

823
00:58:02,163 --> 00:58:03,680
think I'm an abuse receptacle, you witch?
When did I?!

824
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,160
I kept holding it in and
you keep acting out.

825
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,840
Crazy... Hey!

826
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,400
Why did you put your hands down?

827
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:19,010
I made a formal request to her. Request!

828
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:29,170
How do you feel, getting defeated
before the proper game even started?

829
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,440
We just lost a point.

830
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,500
And still a lot of the gaming time remains.

831
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,770
Assemblyman.

832
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,750
Where have you been holed
up to return only now?

833
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,290
-Where is Aide Choi?<br>-Aide Choi?

834
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,120
She is not answering her phone.

835
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,400
Tell her to come quickly, because
I have something to ask her.

836
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:53,830
Assemblyman, wait a minute.

837
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:58,510
Don't trust Aide Choi too much.

838
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,100
-What did you say?<br>-She's diligent and

839
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:06,620
I know she's looking out for you.

840
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,610
However, something is strange.

841
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,970
Aide Choi is Secretary
General Baek's person.

842
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:16,510
She has no reason to do
something to offend him.

843
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:21,570
Hyung, Aide Choi is not
answering her phone?

844
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,470
I have something to ask her.

845
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,250
Hyung, go outside and look for her then.

846
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:39,610
Aide Choi went to meet with
Secretary General Baek.

847
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,220
Why are you telling me that now?!

848
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,410
What do you want to say?

849
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:52,990
I want to finish that race
before the race starts.

850
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:01,570
What is this?

851
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,090
Assemblyman Jin's announcement not to run.

852
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,995
It may be possible for
you to convince him,

853
01:00:06,007 --> 01:00:08,000
because Assemblyman Jin
trusts you completely.

854
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,100
Sunbae-nim.

855
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,770
I will give him a position at a state-owned
company once he is done with his term.

856
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:17,803
Depending on his efforts,
he may get a chance to wear

857
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:20,690
the badge again in the
election after the next one.

858
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:30,230
<i>Is what Chief Seo said true? Is it true...</i>

859
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,110
<i>that this is a hit list?</i>

860
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:35,070
<i>It's too early to make that conclusion.</i>

861
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,760
<i>It could be a document that
idle aides or reporters</i>

862
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,410
<i>made for fun.</i>

863
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,380
<i>Why is Secretary General
Baek doing this to me?</i>

864
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,425
<i>After giving me a party
nomination and having</i>

865
01:00:46,437 --> 01:00:48,360
<i>a very hard time himself
because of that...</i>

866
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,060
<i>why, this late in the game,</i>

867
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,780
<i>why is he doing this to me?</i>

868
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,640
<i>Don't you have a guess?</i>

869
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,790
<i> I don't.</i>

870
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,220
Think about it.

871
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,680
Only pigeons fight to death.

872
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,670
Lions stop when the victor
and loser become clear.

873
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:20,120
With you and me, the victor and
loser have already become clear.

874
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,000
Not yet.

875
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:36,350
For Assemblyman Jin and for you...

876
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,450
this is the best I can do.

877
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,390
Take it.

878
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,960
Assemblyman Jin.

879
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:19,350
<i>Announcement of Intention Not to Run
in Next Year's General Election</i>

880
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,540
Not run?

881
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,570
You should sit down first.

882
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,100
Is this the last task
assigned to you, Aide Choi?

883
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,420
This is a misunderstanding. I will explain.

884
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,130
No.

885
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,360
I have nothing to say so go outside.

886
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,600
- Assemblyman.<br>-I'm not
your assemblyman anymore!
