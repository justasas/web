3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,580
I am hoping that you, Chairman, would
run as our Gookmin Party nominee.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,030
What did you just say?

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,805
I would like to give you
a strategic nomination

6
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:18,140
to run as our Gookmin
Party's candidate.

7
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,470
Do we have the sort of relationship
where we would be trading jokes?

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,410
I'm not at all the type
of person to joke around.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,170
What did you just say?

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,930
- Let's talk separately later. Leave. <br>
- Sunbaenim.

11
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,610
In Kyung...

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,620
Leave.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,350
Let me be the one asking.
What are you doing right now?

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,890
I have promised the people that we would
present a new candidate in Gyeongjae City,

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,530
which is a stronghold
for the Gookmin Party.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,290
I think you are the person who
would satisfy that promise.

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,800
You mean me? Why?

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,990
Aren't you the leader of
the unemployed workers?

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,833
I want you to be in the
National Assembly so

20
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:17,730
that you can help not
only the unemployed but

21
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,380
that you'll be active in social justice
for the weak. That is my expectation.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,830
You really will give
me the nomination?

23
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,520
There is one issue which must
be resolved before we do that.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,970
-What is it? <br>-I understand
that you've been

25
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,002
reported and sued by
your company multiple

26
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:47,200
times including the lawsuit
for money damages.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,100
Before getting our
party nomination,

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,600
each of the lawsuits which are
ongoing should be dismissed.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,670
How?

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,890
Through compromise
with the company.

31
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,070
Do I seem to be the type of dupe who would
fall for a ridiculous trick like that?

32
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,600
Just how much did you get
paid off by the company?

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,890
When you make the decision

34
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,370
I will handle the negotations.

35
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,670
No matter how angry, I'm the type
that never makes the first swing.

36
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,470
Consider yourself lucky.

37
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,230
Take a couple of days
to think it over.

38
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,410
Excuse me!!!

39
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,270
I will look forward
to your call.

Gookmin Party's nomination to
run for the Gyeongjae seat.

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,830
Over the years, I've enticed
many people into politics.

49
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,510
Most of them refused initially,

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,180
but I've never seen
anyone resist to the end.

51
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,530

tell you in advance.

quit as chairman, right?

65
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,150
Did you call me to confirm that?

66
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,550
No.

67
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,690

go down to see you.

You still can't decide? Didn't you take
the chairman position to run for office?

80
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,590
I'm sorry. Please give me a little
more time to think about it.

81

Chairman Jin, timing is
everything for an election.

82
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,334
Before Gookmin Party decides
on its candidate, you have to

83
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:35,850
throw your hat into the ring,
so you can get attention.

84
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,627
We can't wait any longer. The day
after tomorrow is the opening

85
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,080
day for opposition parties'
joint campaign headquarters.

86
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,870
Then, let me ask you a question.

87
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,190
Let's say I get
into the election.

88
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,300
When the election is over, what
are you going to do for us?

89
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,590
Pardon?

90
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,400
Let's chat. Come out.

91
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,780
Why are you acting this way?
Didn't you say okay yesterday?

92
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,030
-Hyungnim, let's settle with the
company first and decide.<br>-Why?

93
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,231
-Did the company say
they want to settle?<br>-No,

94
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:13,190
I just think it will
work out if I try hard.

95
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,070
Settlement? You can always do that even
after you start running for the office.

96
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,170
First, go in and tell them that you
will run and then, let's talk again.

97
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,210
-Hyungnim.<br>-Quickly,
let's go back in.

98
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,970
Sang Pil!

99
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,790
Isn't that Ae Ri?

100
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,690
- Ae Ri!<br>- Come over here.

Let it go.

105
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,260
Sang Pil, a letter
came from Kyung Ah.

106
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,190
A letter?

107
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,256
The girl is brutal. When
the husband is about

108
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:52,870
to run for election,
she won't show up.

109
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,730
I'll be back.

110
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,590
What is up?

111
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,050
We are going to eat out tonight.

112
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,450

113
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,630

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,310

116
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,790

117
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,110
It's not, right?

118
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,390
No, I did get one.

119
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,240

120
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,800

122
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,740
- Ah, really.
<br>- Hey, big rib!

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,950
Let's think of Joo Hee.

124
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,850
Since when did you think of Joo Hee?
Do you even know her birthday?

125
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,210
March 30. As her dad, don't
you think I know that?

126
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,250

127
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,150
Hey, today is... <i>April 2</i>

128
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,150
You know I have a
lot to think about.

129
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,353
To be sure, it's not like
you're trying to be a

130
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,950
neighborhood chief but campaigning
to be an assemblyman.

131
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,370
It hasn't been decided yet.

132
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,520
Enough. Just return the
paper with your stamp.

133
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,090
If not, I'll see you in court.

134
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,450
Why are you being so prickly?

135
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,870
Let this go!

136
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,830
Don't you have any conscience? When you
see how I live, don't you feel anything?

137
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,030
Then, what can I do? Let's
persevere a bit more.

138
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,210
A bit more. A bit more.
It's been 4 years already.

139
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,030
You can actually say
persevere a bit more again?

140
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,698
If I get reinstated, you
and Joo Hee's hardship

141
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,040
will end and our
happiness will start.

142
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,360
Reinstated, my ass!

143
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,549
Even the judge won't reinstate you.
If you set up a tent

144
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,800
and cause a ruckus, the company
is going to reinstate you?

145
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,930
Then, what do you want me to do?
Should I just quit everything?

146
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,730
Enough, I don't want to talk to you
because I'm sick and tired of it.

147
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,640
Anyway, Joo Hee and I will
take care of ourselves.

148
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,090
With Bae Dal Soo whom you can't
live without, go demonstrate and

149
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,780
live like that.

150
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,910
Hey, Kyung Ah.

151
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,230
Hey! I'm not going
to divorce you.

152
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,470
I won't divorce!

153
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,900
Why is it so expensive?

154
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,670
Joo Hee. Jin Joo Hee.
Hey, rascal!

155
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,110
That surprised me.

156
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,720
What is this? I was surprised.

157
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,070
Were you surprised?

158
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,120
Dad, I heard that you were
going to be an assemblyman.

159
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,740
Oh. I don't know
about it just yet.

160
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,680
What kind of style is this?

161
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,780
Shave and clothes, too...
So pathetic.

162
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,690
What did you say, rascal?
Pathetic?

163
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,920
- Pathetic.<br>- To your dad...
you're ducking me?

164
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,840
-Here.<br>-A gift? What is up?

165
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,230
I don't want your butt to
hurt when you are studying.

166
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,990
Dad.

167
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,060
I'm sorry but it's okay for
me to exchange this, right?

168
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,490
Since when did it have a hole?
Go ahead and exchange it.

169
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,420
By the way, how is the
divorce with Mom going?

170
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,800
This woman tells all sorts
of things to a kid.

171
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,700
Don't worry. That
will never happen.

172
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,950
Can't you just divorce her?

173
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,290
What did you say?

174
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,480
For me, I wish you
would do as Mom says.

175
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,770
Why?

176
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,990
Well, just because.

177
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,500
Joo Hee, you don't
like your dad either?

178
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,080
What are you talking about?
I really like you.

179
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,350
Then, why did you
say those things!

180
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,820
That surprised me.
Why are you yelling?

181
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,590
That surprised me.

182
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,740
To be honest, Dad,

183
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,270
you have no ability
to make Mom happy.

184
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,620
I'll keep being your daughter so

185
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,570
let's let Mom go. Okay?

186
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,470
-Joo Hee.<br>-I'm sorry.

187
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,880
Dad, I have to go in.

188
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,900
Election. Fighting.

189
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,380
<i>Poong Kyeong Motel</i>

190
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,920
Shouldn't we at least sign a binder for the
campaign office lease before we leave?

191
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,130
Hurry and load the stuff.

192
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,820
CEO, is something going on?

193
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,920
How many times do I have to
say that I don't feel good!?

194
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,120
Tell me honestly.

195
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,940
You are not going to get
the nomination, right?

196
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,310
<i>A demonstration must be
taking place somewhere.</i>

197
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,960
<i>We'll win fighting to the end.</i>

198
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,450
Sang Pil, what happened
with your wife?

199
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,310
I asked the assemblymen to
give us a bit more time.

200
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,030
When you hear this, call me.

201
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,800
This guy...

202
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,350
What is he doing that he
has his phone turned off?

203
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,960
Maybe he really is
going to divorce?

204
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,320
Divorce is not such
an easy thing.

205
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,770
Well, you divorced... Punk...

206
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,870
Hyungnim.

207
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,960
I think those bastards came
to take down the tent!

208
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,210
♬ When my eyes misty.

209
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,190
♬ In my heart when

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,630
Dang.

213
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,860
Kyung Ah, I...

214
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,300
<i>Hey! Let me sleep!
Aren't you sleepy!</i>

215
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,900
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,080
Sleep well.

217
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,460
Really.

218
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,640
♬ Come back to me.
Come back to me...

219
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,380
Pl..ease.

220
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,790
<i>Hurry up and get over here.</i>

221
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,170
You came.

222
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,740
These as*holes, really.

223
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,310
All this is because they are afraid
that you'll run for the office.

224
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,470
Look how they came
when you weren't here.

225
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,520
What about Hyung Dal Soo? How
come I don't see Hyung Dal Soo?

226
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,120
Why isn't Hyung Dal Soo here?!

227
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,210
What happened?

228
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,760
Hyungnim.

229
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,490
Hyungnim, are you okay?

230
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,840
After he got a pain reliever shot,
he fell asleep a moment ago.

231
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,040
-What did the doctor say?<br>-Except for a
fractured bone, they say he's okay.

232
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,350
For a guy who has no strength, he was
so ferociously going against them...

233
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,630
If it wasn't for Choi In Kyung,

234
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,580
we would have been arrested
at the emergency room.

235
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,140
Who?

236
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,440
At the police station,
that woman...

237
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,800
I'll be leaving now.

238
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,150
As to Bae Dal Soo's arrest
issue, you don't have to worry.

239
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,750
- Why are you doing this?<br>-
Why did you show up there?

240
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,370
The takedown, Secretary General
Baek ordered it, right,

241
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:15,060
to push me to decide! In
collusion with the City, right?!

242
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,870
-Takes one (THUG) to
know one...<br>-What?

243
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,930
Look here, Jin Sang Pil.

244
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,760
When they stopped tearing down the tent
and when Bae Dal Soo didn't get arrested,

245
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,460
you should be thankful to
Secretary General Baek.

246
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,750
What?

247
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,900
I'll tell you one more thing.

248
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,389
Since you are being courted by
both the ruling and opposition

249
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:41,740
parties, you must feel good.
However, know this one thing.

250
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,600
Politics is nothing to laugh at.

251
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,100
I hope you don't turn
politics into a joke.

252
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,150
<i>7 years ago</i>

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,240
If you accept the nomination.

265
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,100

Trust me.

00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,020
Chairman?

268
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,260
Am I doing the right thing?

269
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,230
I also sometimes think
about such a thing.

270
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,120
Whether it's the right thing.

271
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,020
Or is this the
right thing to do?

272
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,350
<i>Chairman, what do you think life
and politics have in common?</i>

273
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,800
-What is it?<br>-There
is no right answer.

274
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,490
There lies only choice.

275
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,200
Struggling to turn that
choice into the right answer,

276
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,320
that is life and politics.

277
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,420
<i>Make your choice.</i>

278
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,160
<i>Hyungnim, come quickly.</i>

279
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,070
Let's quickly go. Quickly.
It's urgent.

280
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,390
It's urgent.

281
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,100
One. Korea Shipbuilding &amp;
Repairs Co., LTD. will,

282
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,160
for all those who want
to find new jobs,

283
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,100
make references to its affiliated
subcontracting companies.

284
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,200
One, to those who were fired,

285
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,030
company shall pay 100% of their
two years' worth of base wages.

286
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,390
One, the company and the
fired employees will

287
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,930
mutually cancel all criminal and
civil lawsuits against each other.

288
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,270
- There are no objections,
right?<br>- Objections or not,

289
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,300
you never told us anything and

290
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,090
just made a settlement?

291
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,740
Isn't this dictatorship?

292
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,290
The committee rules give the
chairperson the authority to settle.

293
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,650
There are no objections, right?

294
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,660
Let's tear down the tent now.

295
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,380
What are you doing? The
fight is over now.

296
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,690
By whose will?

297
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,150
This is invalid! It's invalid!

298
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,800
It's not invalid.

299
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,930
-It's notarized.<br>-You
punk, are you crazy?

300
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,630
Who told you to do such a thing?

301
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,800
I'm the Chairman, Hyung.

302
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,920
You think I gave you the position
so you can do such a thing?

303
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,100
Let's rescind. Because there
was too much opposition,

304
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,700
call and tell them
that is the case.

305
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,830
Hyungnim, please stop already.

306
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,370
And then, let's run
for the office.

307
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,100
Look at them wanting to settle when
they saw that you were going to run.

308
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,570
If we do well in the election,
we can get reinstated.

309
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,910
Just trust me once, Sang Pil!
We can get reinstated.

310
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,220
Please, stop!

311
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,940
Forget about the Assembly and try
running for Presidency! Still.

312
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,220
Do you think those bastards
will reinstate us?

313
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,450
Nevermind being reinstated.
We are about to be jailed.

314
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,483
Will you only wake up when
you become a convict and get

315
00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:13,320
hit with $100-200K judgments
for monetary damages?

316
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,670
Punk, only to give up so
meaninglessly, did we

317
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,270
suffer so much! Don't
you feel wronged?!

318
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,460
Of course I feel wronged!

319
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,970
When I think about
the past suffering,

320
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,980
I feel so resentful
and wronged...

321
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,860
I feel so resentful and wronged that
my whole world seems to fall apart.

322
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,910
However!

323
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:40,630
It's not working. No
matter what sh*t we do...

324
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,680
it's not working.
Isn't that right?

325
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,560
Let's admit it now.

326
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,360
That we are weak. That we are nothing.
Nothing!

327
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,010
Let's admit it.

328
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,230
I'm sorry Hyung.

329
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,680
Sang Pil.

330
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,740
I came to pay my debt.

331
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,950
I forgot about it and thanks.

332
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,280
I'll pay the remaining amount after I
take the exam when I get a part time job.

333
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,220
It's okay. When you get money,
buy yourself car insurance.

334
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,600
No. My personality won't let me go
long without paying back debts.

335
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,270
Even if I have to drive you for
free, I'll make sure I pay you.

336
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,930
So Min, what is it?

00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,300

nominee to run in Gyeongjae City,

Who is that?

00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,890
In an era of increasingly flexible
labor markets, Jin Sang Pil

355
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,366
is, simultaneously, a
symbolic figure who

If anyone puts down a flag
for a new independent party,

389
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,390

their defection notice and rush out.

You want to do
politics correctly?

Yes, I should since I
got the nomination.

417
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,030
Then, let me ask you.

418
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,940
If you have what it takes
to be in politics,

questions that I am about to ask.

your core identity is.

Second, why do you want
to become an assemblyman?

427
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,620
The truth is that I wasn't
initially going to...

428
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,320
Third, as an assemblyman,
what are you going to do?

429

will give their sacred vote and

you really detest me that much?

Not at all. I was going

candidate is so exceptional...

will go your way.

456
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,520
Sounds like you are
disparaging Jin Sang Pil.

Sang Pil a loser.

Young people with sense do not
call him a loser but an underdog.

You should have found someone
who suits our party.

464
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,530
What do you think our
party's identity is?

465
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,480
Look way over there.

right and left wings.

467
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,670
Our party, to a great bird
called the Republic of Korea,

468
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,570
must be its right wing.

469
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,330
Don't resort to imperfect
imitation of the left.

470
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,660
But with pride and dignity...

471
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,320
That is a true conservative.

472
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,060
I, like you, am a person who
stands on the right side.

different directions.

face" and for me, a "left, face."

faces the left.

of being conservative.

There is still the Supreme
Council's confirmation,

481
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,690
and we can cancel on him by finding
some convenient disqualifying reason.

482
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,070
You said you will not interfere with the
Gyeongjae District nomination matter.

483
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,290
I cannot gladly accept anymore of what you
say, even if you are a senior assemblyman.

484
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,950
Just what is the reason for your
obsession with Gyeongjae District?

485
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,530
At most his term will be 1 year and
he's only a half term assemblyman.

486
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,280
Because it's not like you to
force a guy like Jin Sang Pil,

487
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,570
I am asking you.

488

call me because it was free.

00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,360
-Turn it off.<br>-What?

509
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,790
Turn off the radio. Why did you do
it when I didn't ask? Turn it off!

510
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,040
Oh, okay.

511
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,870
But aren't you being
a bit too much?

512
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,331
You made such a ruckus
because you wanted to listen

513
00:35:02,343 --> 00:35:04,720
to politics but today, you
are doing the opposite.

514
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,090
A person has to be consistent.

515
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,460
Will you say something?

516
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,930
Thanks, from now on
I won't be calling.

517
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,090
Hey, although I don't know
what the matter is...

518
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,680
cheer up!

519
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,330
Police...

520
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,790
Make sure you make it.

521
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,290
Alright.

522
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,700
You asked why it was
Jin Sang Pil, right?

523
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,350
In the next election, my
situation looks gloomy.

524
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,350
When things look bleak, I start to
remember things that I had forgotten.

525
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,970
My father, whom people
remember only as an

526
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:20,880
undersecretary of the
Department of State Affairs,

527
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,770
was the first ever appointed mayor of
Gyeongjae. With one month left in his term,

528
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:29,000
that I was born then.

529
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,150
Next year, I'll run
in Gyeongjae City.

530
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,930
Sunbae-nim...

531
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:50,600
I didn't want to step over you.
That's why I chose Jin Sang Pil.

532
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,490
They say a politician thinks
of the next generation and

533
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,340
a political hack thinks of
the next election only.

534
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:03,720
I thought I was a politician but
I was only a political hack.

535
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,310
I'm so confused right now.

536
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,950
I don't know what to say...

537
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,120
<i>Hyung-nim, where in
the world are you?</i>

538
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,120
<i>I have something to tell
you so please call me.</i>

539
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:02,570
What brought you here?

540
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,728
I am Seo Dong Jae, referred
to you by Secretary Lim

541
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,260
Gyu Tae of Secretary General
Baek Do Hyeon's office.

542
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,800
Oh, the person who is
going to help me...

543
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,610
<i>Don't you know Hangeul? Hurry and
remove that so we can move our stuff.</i>

544
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,410
Perhaps in Assemblyman Yang
Sung Gil's office that time...

545
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,690
Gyeongjae City is my expertise.

546
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,970
I'll do my utmost to assist you.

547
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,450
Ah, please look after me.

548
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,900
Now, fighting!

549
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,660
Fighting!

550
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,750
<i>Fighting!<br>The best!</i>

551
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,350
Oh, yes.

552
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:25,360
Oh, below... Please go in.

553
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,950
Hey, assh*le. Did you stop the
demonstration to just get a gold badge?

554
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:44,600
What do you think you are doing?
This is political terrorism.

555
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,510
It's okay.

556
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,990
Hey, Jin Sang Pil.

557
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:52,300
I'll keep an eye on you to see
how well you eat and live.

558
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,690
Let's just go. What
a filthy sight!

559
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,340
No, these guys...

560
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,100
Candidate, are you okay?

561
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,930
Yes.

562
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,050
Oh, no. I rented
these clothes...

563
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,620
Give it to me.

564
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,240
Those small minded assh*les.

565
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,445
They were the first to
file job applications

566
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,030
and now they are
throwing a tantrum?

567
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,870
You came, Hyung?

568
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,080
Oh, really.

569
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,483
I'm going to start work in
about a month. Is there

570
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:32,560
anything I can do? You are
going to feed me, right?

571
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,945
Of course, would I let you starve?
What about

572
00:40:34,957 --> 00:40:37,510
Hyung Dal Soo? Can't you
get in contact with him?

573
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:43,720
I don't know. He is nowhere
to be found. Nowhere.

574
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,850
You know that the original
draft was for me, right?

575
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,740
You must have not felt too well.

576
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,760
If I dig and mess up Jin Sang Pil,
you'll be in difficult position.

577
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,600
This is the best I can do.

578
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,250
Thanks. For now, concentrate on your
business. I'll see how I can help you.

579
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:09,160
No. I decided to close
down the company.

580
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:16,040
If I stay any longer, I'll end
up petitioning for bankruptcy.

581
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,470
Any thoughts for afterwards?

582
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,620
I'll have to think after
I get some fresh air but

583
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,240
I plan to become a
person who can demand...

584
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,750
a party nomination more
deservedly than now.

585
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,630
-I look cool today,
don't I?<br>-Rascal.

586
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,590
Yes?

587
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,941
<i>Secretary General, a
Korea Shipbuilding &amp;</i>

588
00:41:42,953 --> 00:41:45,110
<i>Repairs laid-off worker
called Bae Dal Soo</i>

589
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,720
<i>showed up at the company and
started to go on a hunger strike.</i>

590
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:56,570
Rescind the nomination.
Defeat Jin Sang Pil!

591
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,280
Hyungnim.

592
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,310
Before fasting, you have to
take anthelmintic medication.

593
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,793
Oh, and my assistant told me that
you can get arrested for illegal

594
00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:18,600
campaigning if you call for certain
person's defeat in election.

595
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,360
Don't write stuff like this.

596
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,980
Because you went missing all of a
sudden, I was not able to tell you.

597
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:32,370
If I get elected, let's
go the Assembly together.

598
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,930
You know I can't do
anything without you.

599
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,130
Give me some help and...

600
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:46,050
if a good place opens
up, let's move.

601
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,430
-Sang Pil.<br>-Yes?

602
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:53,880
Do me a favor. Get
out of my sight.

603
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,920
Hyungnim...

604
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,930
I'll be back.

605
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:16,130
Defeat Jin Sang Pil.
Nullify the nomination.

606
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,970
Defeat Jin Sang Pil.

607
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,580
Popular opinion is
against Jin Sang Pil.

608
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,190
Former Assemblyman
Yang Sung Gil says

609
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,842
he has thought of having
his wife run as an

610
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:30,640
independent candidate.
Should I meet with him?

611
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,090
Let it be.

612
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:38,280
When the floor gets too hot, they'll kick
off the blanket and come out by themselves.

613
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,250
I understand.

614
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:45,560
Then, I'll heat up the floor
by giving it some fire.

615
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,940
<i>Hurry. Hurry.</i>

616
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,870
<i>Gookmin Party<br><i>City of Gyeungjae
IS ANGRY: Go away Jin Sang Pil</i></i>

617
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,720
<i>CITY OF GYEONGJAE IS ANGRY:
Go away Jin Sang Pil</i>

618
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,920
Put a stop to back-door
nominations!

619
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,930
<i>Put a stop! Put a stop!</i>

620
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,400
I'm certain that the Anti-BH
faction egged them on.

621
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,040
They are the type to scatter on their own
once we get the nomination confirmation.

622
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,070
Secretary General.

623
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,373
The Office of Party Leader
called and said they

624
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:10,700
are calling off today's
Supreme Council meeting.

625
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,470
This means that they want to defer
Jin Sang Pil's confirmation.

626
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,350
Welcome, Secretary General Baek.

627
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:21,680
Have you met with the party
members from Gyeungjae City?

628
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,190
-I received their request to
meet but I refused it.<br>-What?

629
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,820
I thought the Supreme Council
meeting should be held first.

630
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,930
Please hold a Supreme Council meeting
and confirm Jin Sang Pil's nomination.

631
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,810
As for me, I do not
like Jin Sang Pil.

632
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,540
Same for me.

633
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,840
Are there any reasons why Jin Sang
Pil cannot get the nomination?

634
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,650
He lacks qualifications
and capacity!

635
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,052
Supreme Councilman Kim,
are the qualifications

636
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:48,530
and capacity you speak of,
something like these?

637
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,318
SKY(SHORT FOR SEOUL, KOREA, YONSEI,
3 TOP UNIVERSITIES)-graduated

638
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,830
judges, prosecutors, lawyers
or high ranking officials,

639
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,999
top executives of publicly
traded companies, or CEOs of

640
00:44:54,011 --> 00:44:56,660
well-established companies with
annual sales of $10 million or more.

641
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,900
Journalists or professors
image peddling on TV!

642
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,760
What did you say?

643
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,210
There is only one qualification
to represent the people:

644
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,120
A citizen of the Republic of Korea
with the eligibility to run.

645
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,909
Secretary General Baek,
behind the party members

646
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:12,780
making such ruckus outside
stands Park Choon Seob.

647
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,044
If we push through the confirmation,
the Anti-BH faction will use it

648
00:45:15,056 --> 00:45:17,200
as an excuse to create a whirlwind
with an independent candidate.

649
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,950
Do you think you can
win with Jin Sang Pil?

650
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,810
Don't we have the party
leadership decision?

651
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,750
-What?<br>-Party Leader.

652
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,001
I would like to request that
today's Supreme Council

653
00:45:28,013 --> 00:45:30,490
meeting be held not here at the
party headquarters, but...

654
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,800
at candidate Jin Sang Pil's
office in Gyeongjae City.

655
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,600
Put a stop to back-door nominations
which ignore the will of the people!

656
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,400
Put a stop! Put a stop!

657
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,780
Put a stop to back-door nominations
which ignore the will of the people!

658
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,400
This is what I'm saying.

659
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,530
Party Leader, say something.

660
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:01,110
<i>If you want, I'll resign from the
Party offices. Baek Do Hyeon.</i>

661
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,120
What is this?

662
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:19,160
Assemblyman Park, the Supreme Council
members are flocking to Gyeongjae City.

663
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,940
I guess that pathetic Yoo Jeong Soo
tucked his tail in before Baek Do Hyeon.

664
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,920
-Why haven't you left?<br>-What?

665
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,760
If you arrive later than the guest of
honor, it won't look good for you. Run!

666
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,950
Oh, okay.

667
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,630
I can still see your legs.
Quickly run!

668
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:38,280
Okay.

669
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,370
Even faster!

670
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,020
Move it to the left. Move the
whole thing to the left.

671
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,170
So it will hang straight.

672
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,010
Let's leave it alone. Go to the right side.
It's perfect.

673
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:55,920
No, it has to move left
so it can be centered.

674
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,730
No, you can't tell the

675
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:04,650
<i>May you be victorious.
Assemblyman Park Choon Seob</i>

676
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,080
Park Choon Seob?

677
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,850
He is a fifth term Assemblyman and
the leader of the Anti-BH faction.

678
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,410
But why would he...?

679
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:15,770
Sang Pil, look over there.

680
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,100
<i>Hurry up and come out.</i>

681
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,800
<i>Hello.</i>

682
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,647
They are the party members.
From city councilmen

683
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:29,460
to neighborhood representatives,
everybody came.

684
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,970
What?

685
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,520
I heard that you sent a wreath.
Thank you for showing your concern.

686
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,700
As a senior member of the Party,
I just did what I had to do.

687
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,820
By the way,

688
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,690
you must not forget the position
that I requested for Yang Seung Gil.

689
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:51,270
Of course. Then...

690
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:05,270
<i>Nullify nomination.

00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,670

<i>Who is it? Who are you?</i>

695
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,600
The person who was on
hunger strike, did he quit?

696
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,370
If you called me out,

697
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:04,940
talk. Why aren't you
saying anything?

698
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,540
If you have nothing to say...

699
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,320
I'm going to go back in.

700
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,150
Dad...

701
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,950
Look here.

702
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:31,790
I am a lowly pathetic person.

703
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:36,410
Since I'm a person who does not
deserve to be your father,

704
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:41,590
from now on, think of
us as total strangers.

705
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,240
How come you live like this?

706
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,370
Just what is that reinstatement? What is
it to you that you are hell bent on it?

707
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:56,800
What did you say?

708
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,910
Dad, are you stupid? How come
you are living so stupidly?

709
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,150
Watch what you say.

710
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,700
By doing this, what do
you think you gain?

711
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,890
What I want?

712
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:07,240
What I want is one thing.

713
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,620
That I, this Bae Dal Soo,
am not a piece of trash.

714
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,990
They use me as they please and

715
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,743
they throw me out in the
street as they pleased.

716
00:50:17,755 --> 00:50:20,350
I am not that kind of
trash but a human being.

717
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,990
That I didn't live a wanton life to
be treated like a piece of trash.

718
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:30,210
I am confirming that.
Is that enough?

719
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:35,710
So what if one lives like trash? That
Jin Sang Pil is total human trash.

720
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:39,150
He's trash because he betrayed
you and got the nomination!

721
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:42,390
But look.

722
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:47,070
Now, that trash is going
to become an assemblyman.

723
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,540
All the people will bow to him.

724
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:54,030
He'll be walking around with stiff
shoulders and be treated well.

725
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:01,130
Why can't you live like that?

726
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,430
That's enough.

727
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,610
I'll say one more thing.

728
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:12,430
I'll do as you say.
From now on...

729
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,030
I don't have a
biological father.

00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,310
-Oh, yes.<br>-What is the
reason for calling for me?

761
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:43,150
I heard that you closed the company down.
Is that right?

762
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:48,410
It's correct that I closed it down but
what is the reason for looking into it?

763
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:54,810
If you have nothing to do, I thought
of asking you to be my executive aide.

764
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:00,030
Now...you want me to do what?

765
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:04,530
I am allowed up to 2 4th-grade aides. If
Aide Seo outside and you, Choi In Kyung...

766
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:09,330
Look! I used to be the Blue House
Senior Executive Administrator.

767
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,850
If you did that, then you can't be an aide?

768
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:15,410
Assemblyman, that's not what
In Kyung is saying but...

769
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:20,850
If that's not it, then please do so. I won
by your strategic manual that you wrote.

770
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,710
Choi In Kyung is really great.

771
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:28,490
I can't bear to sit here. I'll just leave.

772
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:34,550
Please wait. I...

773
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,470
have to be a good assemblyman.

774
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:44,330
Besides the people, there is a
hyung that I like the best.

775
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:48,350
Because of him, I have to do good.

776
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:53,310
Okay, do it well. Just do it well.

777
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,565
You asked me a while ago
why I want to become

778
00:56:56,577 --> 00:56:59,630
an assemblyman. Back
then, I had no answer.

779
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:03,750
Ever since, I've been racking my brain
for the answer, but I still don't know.

780
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:09,410
With my head, I still won't know in
the future. But I have to do it well.

781
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:13,370
So, do it well! Do it well. Well!

00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:16,810
-In Kyung.<br>-Choi In Kyung,
you know that answer.

783
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:21,290
At least you'll know what I should do.
Please help me.

784
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:24,870
I told you I don't want to.
Look for someone else.

785
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,690
-Don't just brush me off and
do it, please.<br>-I won't do it.

786
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:30,170
Please do it. Really!
