<i> All characters, party
names, and incidents</i>

00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>appearing in this drama

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,250
From now on...

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,620
for you and the
Pro-BH faction...

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,380
I will do anything.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,580
I came here to tell
you my determination.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,920
Leave.

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,490
Please forgive me for
my past transgressions.

9
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:49,710
Right... right now,
what are you doing?

10
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,680
What is this?

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,590
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil
Introduces 0 Bills!</i>

12
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,310
This article doesn't
make any sense!

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>Episode 6</i><br>Ah, seriously.

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,210
How long has it been since the
assemblyman joined the Assembly?!

15
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,870
Aide, you are friendly with
this reporter on their

16
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:17,620
news desk.<br>Hurry and ask
him to change it for you.

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,150
If I go through the desk, I will get
singled out by field reporters.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,800
Where's Secretary Kim?

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,140
Where do you think a person who ran
laps in the midsummer heat went?

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,040
Where?

21
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,110
<i>If this happens one more
time, I will let you go.</i>

22
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,950
Secretary Kim.

23
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,020
Aide Choi told me to
give this to you.

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,910
Ah, yes.

25
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,660
Aide Choi does try to
look tough on her job.

26
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,150
She's not doing that
because she hates you.

27
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,590
So don't be too sad about it.

28
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,890
I'm not sad.

29
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,200
She was rather cool, I thought.

30
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,830
What?

31
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,580
How proud she is of herself, I
only realized this time around.

32
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,530
Not everyone has
that kind of pride.

33
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,050
Secretary Kim, you look at people
from such a positive angle.

34
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,755
In my eyes, she appears like
a returned single (DIVORCEE)

35
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:38,250
flailing with the only thing
she has left, her pride.

36
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,970
Returned single?

37
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,090
Reporter Kim... My old man entered the
National Assembly only yesterday.

38
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,310
You have to understand that he
has no legislative track record.

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,590
The 3 assemblymen who entered
together with Assemblyman Jin...

40
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,640
seem to have introduced
a few bills.

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,750
Eh, commonsensically speaking,
would those be proper bills?

42
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,500
They must have been recycled bills
that were scrapped a long time ago.

43
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,950
So?

44
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,600
Please delete my assemblyman's
name from the article headline.

45
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,200
If there is a good item, I will
reserve it just for you, huh?

46
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,550
A salad-green guy with such
a stiff neck (HAUGHTY)!

47
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,990
May he get a cervical
disc herniation!

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,460
Who is this?

49
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,980
Hello.

50
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,360
- Have you been well?<br>- Yes.

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,520
What brings you here,
Assemblywoman?

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,470
I'm here to give my briefing.

53
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm a woman whose job is
spokeswoman, you know.

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,330
- How about you, In Kyung?<br>- Why would a
woman whose job is to be an aide come here?

55
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,320
I came to fix an article.

56
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,120
In Kyung, now I see that you're the type
who gives in to reality really fast.

57
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,300
What kind of article is it?

58
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,490
So unlike you to be
procrastinating on your job.

59
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,820
Look through it all.

60
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,120
<i>25. Hong Chan Mi 22.9%</i>

61
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,400
What is this?

62
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,130
For all intents and purposes, I was a woman
whose job was being a lawyer, but what?

63
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,180
In the Assembly, my rank
as a legislator is 25th?!

64
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,760
If I'm the 25th out of
300, what is the GPA tier?

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,890
You're probably about...
in the second tier.

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,337
I'm a person who graduated
from a foreign language

67
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:58,980
high school (GOOD HIGH SCHOOL)
with a first-tier GPA.

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,510
Within this month, make it the first tier
and within the top 5 in the whole school.

69
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,980
But Assemblywoman, that is... if you
give us a little bit of time...

70
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,230
I don't have that kind of time.

71
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,338
Starting next month, I will
send everyone, except the

72
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,430
female secretary and intern,
to my hometown district.

73
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,190
Didn't you send Secretary Sim packing
and hire a local office manager?

74
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,330
Is an electoral district
some bathroom toilet bowl?

75
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,090
Can it be loosened up and
unclogged by one person?!

76
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,240
Still, Assemblywoman, wouldn't
that be a bit harsh...?

77
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,340
This person, seriously, now!

78
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,045
Don't expect humane treatment from
a proportional representative (not

79
00:05:37,057 --> 00:05:38,960
elected, but appointed) with less
than 10 months remaining in her term.

80
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,125
Because right now I can see
nothing beyond blazing a trail

81
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:43,130
in my own constituency and
getting a party nomination.

82
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,619
Everyone, bear this in mind.
From now on, for

83
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:47,860
the Office of Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi,

84
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,328
the first objective is to
get a party nomination,

85
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,770
the second is a party
nomination and the third...

86
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,860
also is to get a
party nomination.

87
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,559
The VIP (PRESIDENT OF
KOREA) is deeply worried

88
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:01,340
about the second half of
the parliamentary year.

89
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,340
It is understandable.

90
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,050
When there are mountains
of bills to be processed,

91
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,980
the opposition party, with
the next year's general

92
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,200
election in mind, will take
uniformly hard line positions.

93
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,918
Leaving the opposition parties
on the back burner, why

94
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,760
don't you first do something
about the Anti-BH faction?

95
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,520
They keep throwing a monkey wrench at
every turn and it is really maddening.

96
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,260
Please tell the Elder that I will
do a thorough housekeeping job.

97
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,440
You have to do well.

98
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,960
If even the latter half of the
parliamentary year goes awry...

99
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,780
we will be lame ducks.

100
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,610
<i>"Lame duck" -an elected
official still in</i>

101
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:35,640
<i>office after the election
of his/her successor</i>

102
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,090
<i>Do the Party Leader's job right!</i>

103
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,890
<i>You are the ruling party's leader, not
some frontman for the Blue House!</i>

104
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,930
<i>But are you saying, right now, that we
should make a strategic nomination?</i>

105
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,860
<i>Then, I can't participate
in a meeting like this!</i>

106
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,220
Did something happen
at the Blue House?

107
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,400
You don't look so well.

108
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,320
I'd better tie up the
Anti-BH faction.

109
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,080
How?

110
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,300
By using our power, the right to give party
nominations for the next general election.

111
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,928
-Party nomination rights?
<br>- I should make a special committee

112
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,540
under direct party control to
improve the party nomination rules.

113
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,118
These assemblymen at the end of
their terms... Just the sound of

114
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,600
"nom" from party nomination will
make their hair stand on end.

115
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,043
Just the fact that the party
nomination talk has started

116
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,510
within the party will be enough
to freeze them with fear.

117
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,060
So you are saying, frighten them
to make them follow meekly.

118
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,938
Assemblywoman Hong, please openly
make a statement that we should

119
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,480
make a special committee to improve
the party nomination rules.

120
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,930
Are you asking me
to bear the brunt?

121
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,890
I know it's burdensome
in many ways.

122
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,400
However, punches like this must be
thrown, even among the Pro-BH faction,

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,880
by my direct associate assemblyman
to deliver more impact.

124
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,090
But, Secretary General...

125
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,932
Just one wrong move and I might
become the target for Anti-BH

126
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:18,580
hatred and be forced out of
the spokeswoman position.

127
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,240
While trying to make
my own constituency,

128
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,950
the only title I can flaunt is the
longest-serving spokeswoman for the party.

129
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,391
Things like this must be
undertaken by someone with

130
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:28,620
adversarial zeal, like
you, Assemblywoman Hong.

131
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,420
Secretary General...

132
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,970
So far, I have never refused
anything you asked me to do.

133
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,449
To the extent that even though
I'm a married woman, they

134
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,690
mockingly call me Secretary
General's Yeouido wife.

135
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,270
- Assemblywoman
Hong...<br>- I am sorry.

136
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,970
Please leave me out of
this just this once.

137
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,440
Don't you want to see me
in the Assembly next year?

138
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,550
Aigoo... Hey, everyone!

139
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,080
At least put a popsicle in
your mouth while doing that.

140
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,830
You're doing this to survive.

141
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,740
What a shame it will be if you
get heat stroke and fall sick.

142
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,750
Here. Everyone share.

143
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,060
Those of you fasting, there
is ice water here. Take it.

144
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,800
Oh, thank you. Come
here, everyone.

145
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,640
Everyone, hurry and come.

146
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,510
Hello?

147
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,115
Assemblyman Jin, it was
Aide Choi and she said

148
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:32,040
if we don't return promptly,
she will sack me.

149
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,930
You are back?

150
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,520
Yes. Did everyone eat?

151
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,060
- Yes.<br>- Assemblyman.

152
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,510
Where were you?

153
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,180
I was outside to get
some fresh air.

154
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,400
Please see me for a second.

155
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,530
What's wrong with her?

156
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,710
Jeez. I'm going to go crazy.

157
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,580
Aide Choi is a bit rough
toward the assemblyman.

158
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,270
Everyone in the Assembly Hall acknowledges
that she is an assemblywoman-level aide.

159
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,730
An aide is an aide, what
assemblywoman-level?

160
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,410
Then, what is our assemblyman?

161
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,220
What do you mean by that? Obviously,
he is an intern-level assemblyman.

162
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,690
What is this?<br><i>Dear Secretary
General Baek Do Hyeon</i>

163
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,830
<i>As you know, as a first-term
assemblyman, I am lacking in many ways.</i>

164
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,230
<i>If I ever did something to displease
you, please understand that it was a</i>

165
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,720
<i>mistake made out of inexperience, and I
beg for your generous forgiveness...</i>

166
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,946
It's a letter to Secretary
General Baek.<br>Please

167
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,370
transcribe it in your
own handwriting.

168
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,340
Forget it.

169
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,090
If you read it, you will see that it is
not a real letter of remorse or apology.

170
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,380
This is just a pretext and I
will personally persuade him.

171
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,260
Forget it, you can
take this away.

172
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,680
I guess you are doing this out of hurt
pride, but this is nothing in Yeouido.

173
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,745
There are countless spineless
people who even kneel before

174
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:08,870
the influential party members
at times of party nominations.

175
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,580
I said, just take that away.

176
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,071
Assemblyman, at this rate,
you will be branded

177
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,640
as an assemblyman without
any sense of presence.

178
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,720
You may just disappear without even being
able to start working for your goals. So...

179
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,640
Aide Choi!<br>Enough already.

180
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,070
I agreed to the change of the standing
committees as you told me to do.

181
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,000
The work I want to do
right now is not this.

182
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,100
Let me do what I want to do.

183
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,040
I will listen.

184
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,580
What is the work
that you want to do?

185
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,230
I...

186
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,530
So that a person like me
is not produced again,

187
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:00,060
I want to make a law
that prohibits layoffs.

188
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,930
You can draw up as many
bills as you wish.

189
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,240
But enacting them into law is
not within your present power.

190
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,687
Then, a law that does not
let mom and pop stores

191
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:10,980
like Department Head
Oh's just go belly up!

192
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,060
That also would be impossible,
using your current influence.

193
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,900
Then what do I do?

194
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,440
Should I just swagger and
sit around like this?

195
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,495
Just hand out popsicles to
the people demonstrating

196
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:28,600
outside the Assembly Hall, huh?
Stay that way?

197
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,490
Did I become an assemblyman
to do those things?

198
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,873
Don't overstate things.
I am simply telling you

199
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,180
about your limits as a
first-term assemblyman.

200
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,866
But you didn't say those
things when you told me to

201
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,420
transfer to another committee.
So you tricked me.

202
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,440
What do you mean by tricking you?
Please do not say that again.

203
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,640
Just answer your phone.

204
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:57,730
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

205
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,750
Yes, Secretary General.

206
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,606
This evening, I have a dinner
get-together with close

207
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,380
assemblymen at a Korean
restaurant called Gyeongwon.

208
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,560
I'll have a seat
reserved for you.

209
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,410
Yes, I understand,
Secretary-General.

210
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,920
Later.

211
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,200
What did the Secretary
General say?

212
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,480
Tonight, at a place called Gyeongwon or
something, with his close assemblymen...

213
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,240
he will have a dinner and
he asked me to come.

214
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,880
This is why seniors
are different.

215
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,620
In the end, the Secretary General
first held out his hand.

216
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,640
In great contrast to you, whose pride
was hurt at a trivial thing like this.

217
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,680
At any rate, congratulations
on your escape from ostracism.

218
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,660
Oh, I'm <i>so</i> grateful
to be congratulated.

219
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,180
Today's meeting is probably among Secretary
General Baek's close associate assemblymen.

220
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,290
Close associates?

221
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,097
Even within the Pro-BH
faction, there are many

222
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:09,160
sub-factions depending on
the patrons or backgrounds.

223
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,298
Of course, the core is
Secretary General Baek's close

224
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,260
associate assemblymen whom
he directly cares for.

225
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,470
- Assemblyman, you are here?<br>
- How are you?

226
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,130
Everyone is here already.

227
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,260
Oh, is that right?

228
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,640
Aide Choi, you did
very well this time.

229
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,720
About what?

230
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,340
About Assemblyman Jin kneeling before
Secretary General Baek, you know.

231
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,240
It was a divine move.

232
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,000
Who knelt? Assemblyman Jin did?

233
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,120
Weren't you the one
who put him up to it?

234
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,220
Assemblyman Jin, welcome.

235
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,720
Oh, my apologies. It seems
I got the timing wrong.

236
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,093
You were invited late on purpose.
It's your first

237
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,920
attendance and we needed some
time to welcome you properly.

238
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,980
Properly?

239
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,500
Let's all give our Assemblyman
Jin a round of applause.

240
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,240
Welcome.

241
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,960
The Financial Supervisory Service says
Saejin and a Taiwanese company NOTec may...

242
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,949
do an M &amp; A.<br><i>("M
&AMP; A": merger and

243

244
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,720
<i>Saejin and NOTec Merger...</i>

245
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,715
Including some businessmen
in the upcoming

246
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:43,920
special presidential
pardon, how is that going?

247
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,645
I think there is a severe
clash of opinions between

248
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:47,360
the Ministry of Justice and
the financial agencies.

249
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,080
I think we'd better put the house
in order before something happens.

250
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,584
Park Han Sae, who has been promoted
to become the National Daily's

251
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:04,360
political news editor, is a person
with a strong pro-opposition tendency.

252
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,208
Please take that into
consideration when you

253
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,080
do future interviews
with the National Daily.

254
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,880
Park Han Sae... he
is meticulous...

255
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,620
Meticulous... he's meticulous...

256
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,920
- Assemblyman Jin. <br> - Yes?

257
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,860
I will relay to you the Party Leader's
message I got before coming here.

258
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,400
What?

259
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,848
We've decided to appoint you
to the currently vacant seat

260
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,140
of the chairman of the party's
Employment Policy Committee

261
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,660
and as vice chairman of the
third political division.

262
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,160
Oh, congratulations!

263
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,420
Wow, as soon as you join
us, you get party posts.

264
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

265

- Thank you. <br> -
Congratulations.

266
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,279
Now, the Seo Dae Han (PRESIDENT
OF KOREA) Government

267

is coming to the latter
part of its administration.

268

The silky smooth road from the
earlier times of the administration

269
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,800
has disappeared and only a wild,
thorny path lies before us.

We are the only people on whom the
Elder can rely until the end.

why don't we all share a drink
to renew our firm resolve?

People and Party!

00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,200
and escort you back and

339
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,930
even cook for your fast
relief from a hangover?

340
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,750
Aish, then, just stop,
if you are so butthurt.

341
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,670
I will bear it for
Ae Ri's sake, aigoo.

342
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,410
Ae Ri, my butt.

343
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,000
Aish, you disloyal punk!

344
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,090
With your hyung waiting
outside, did the expensive

345
00:23:11,102 --> 00:23:12,750
liquor travel down
your throat smoothly?

346
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,210
It just went down
straight and easy.

347
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,160
It went down straight.

348
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:31,080
Hey, you should have
said something.

349
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,540
You just wait if this
ramen tastes bad...

350
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,950
What is this?

351
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,470
This is the Han River here.

352
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,330
You know my blood
sugar is high...

353
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,620
Eat, eat, eat it up.

354
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,330
Oh, Aide Choi!

355
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,190
I came to ask him something.
Am I disturbing you?

356
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,510
Aigo, what, what, what is it?

357
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,410
Come here and eat
ramen while we talk.

358
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,110
It's okay. I'll wait outside.

359
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,250
Hey, after meal, look here!

360
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,530
Did you do something
wrong again?

361
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,230
Aigoo, really...

362
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,660
Why, you should have come in.

363
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,590
If the ramen gets soggy,
it will be inedible.

364
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,410
Sorry to disturb you
while you were eating.

365
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,460
How was your first
factional meeting today?

366
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,410
It was just... interesting.

367
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,480
Hearing a lot of things that I
could not get from newspapers...

368
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,820
In the near future, you will experience
many changes in your day-to-day life.

369
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,329
Reporters will follow you around
and government agencies and

370
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:50,820
big corporations will get men
specifically to deal with you.

371
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,532
The stiff attitudes of the party
incumbents, let alone those

372
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:56,090
of the government officials,
will turn around completely.

373
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,690
Aigoo, I guess factions
aren't liked for nothing.

374
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,400
That faction is like a thorn
attached to a beautiful rose.

375
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,463
If you become intoxicated
by the sweetness a

376
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:09,550
faction brings, you can
lose your soul to it.

377
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,720
Use your faction, but you
cannot let it enslave you.

378
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,690
Okay. I got it.

379
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:23,640
Did they, by any chance, give
you an order at the meeting?

380
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,503
<i>It's a matter decided by the faction.
Please broach the</i>

381
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:30,820
<i>subject in tomorrow's party
main incumbents' meeting.</i>

382
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,480
<i>- Me?<br>- Of course, officially it has to
be represented as your personal belief.</i>

383
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,690
An order?

384
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,597
I'm asking because I'm
uneasy about their excessive

385
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:41,910
kindness. They even
gave you party posts.

386
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,340
I didn't get anything.

387
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,820
Okay, I guess I was
overly sensitive.

388
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,520
I'm sorry about what
happened this afternoon.

389
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,280
For raising my voice
over nothing.

390
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,650
That's okay. I was impolite.
I am sorry.

391
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,420
Our Aide Choi is, after all,...

392
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,230
a magnanimous person,
magnanimous.

393
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,460
Magnanimous (KOREAN PRONUNCIATION ENDS
WITH "BAE," HOMOPHONE AS STOMACH)!

394
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,460
You're the best.

395
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,350
I'll see you tomorrow.

396
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,530
Magnifico!

397
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,580
Goodbye.

398
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,010
<i>The Way A Party Nomination Is
Made Must Be Debated Soon!</i>

399
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,820
<i>Gookmin Party Headquarters</i>

400
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,560
The opposition parties are organizing
a special consumer economy committee

401
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,240
and planning a national tour.

402
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,640
We can't just sit
still and do nothing.

403
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,538
Since the supplementary budget
bill was passed too, in order to

404
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,370
maximize the effect, how about
we ask the central party office

405
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,767
as well as branch offices in
the provinces and cities to

406
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,090
organize special committees
to stimulate the economy?

407
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,890
That's a good idea.

408
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,630
The Supreme Council
will review this.

409
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,630
Okay, then, we will move on to
discuss miscellaneous items.

410
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,860
Is there any assemblyman
who wants to speak?

411
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,250
Yes, I..., hmm, I will speak.

412
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,560
Next year's general
election is not far off.

413
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,830
That election..., I mean, how we are
going to make party nominations...

414
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,840
I felt like I had to say
something about that.

415
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,420
Assemblyman Jin, you can't bring
up such topic willy nilly.

416
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,077
What do you mean willy nilly?
I'm an assemblyman,

417
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,170
too, and I think I
can talk about this.

418
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,890
Quick! Record this and send
the file to Aide Choi!

419
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,070
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!<br>-
Umm, okay, yes.

420
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:09,680
Or whether we will do an open...
open primary...

421
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,000
I think we have to decide soon.

422
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,310
<i>Open Primary - a primary
election in which the</i>

423
00:28:14,322 --> 00:28:15,700
<i>public participate and
directly select candidates</i>

424
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,075
<i>So what I'm saying is whether
a screening committee</i>

425
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:22,300
<i>will screen candidates
like we're doing now</i>

426
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,400
<i>or whether we will
do that open...</i>

427
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,650
<i>open primary...</i>

428
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,940
<i>I think we have to decide soon.</i>

429
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,540
Did he consult you
about this first?

430
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,620
Ahew, this old man really, when
I was so patient with him!

431
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,200
What do you think you're doing?

432
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,660
What do you want now?

433
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,150
Last night you told me you hadn't
gotten any order from them!

434
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,580
I got it this morning.

435
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,270
Don't lie to me. Do
you think I'm stupid?

436
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,294
If I had told you yes,
you would have thrown

437
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:58,980
a fit again, telling
me not to do it!

438
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,780
That's why I did it.<br>What
did you tell me before?

439
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,330
Except for breathing, we would
discuss everything together!

440
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,460
I didn't want to put you
in a difficult position.

441
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,750
Okay?

442
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,690
What did you say?

443
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,730
Then, are you going to be
an aide all your life?

444
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,930
You can't be on bad terms with Secretary
General Baek!<br>That will be all my fault.

445
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,960
My throat hurts from
riding a horse too much.

446
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,020
In any event, I will take
care of that faction stuff.

447
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,170
Don't worry about it.

448
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,930
I want to rest.

449
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,500
Oh, my throat.

450
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,297
What in the world is this
party nomination for

451
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:56,550
everyone to be making
such a fuss over it?

452
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,690
You know, assemblymen are like terminal
patients with only 4 years to live.

453
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,380
A party nomination decides whether they
can live it up for another 4 years or...

454
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,720
live a life that's worse than that
of a dog whose owner just died.

455
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,700
I know that but...

456
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,250
Why does Aide Choi
look so worried?

457
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,352
The right to give party
nominations is under the hands

458
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:17,440
of Pro-BH faction. At the
position of Anti-BH faction,

459
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,180
they will be panic-stricken when they hear
about the party nomination all of sudden.

460
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,150
Our Assemblyman Jin threatened
them with a knife like this!

461
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,210
Jin Sang Pil does not seem
to be in his right mind.

462
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,650
Baek Do Hyeon must have
controlled him behind!

463
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,680
He tried to make us
boiled down with fear.

464
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,150
Yes that's right.<br>We just can't
let him say whatever he wants.

465
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,280
Yes, that is right.

466
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,350
Jin Sang Pil...

467
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,629
crawled between Secretary
General Baek's legs

468
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,640
in the end (REPRESENTS
ABJECT SERVILITY).

469
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,410
Right now, I will go and tell Jin
Sang Pil to take back what he said.

470
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,050
If he doesn't listen, then
I'll just rip his mouth apart.

471
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,750
Leave him alone. What does
that bumpkin know anyway?

472
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,270
Assemblyman Park.

473
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,520
Please let's do
politics gracefully.

474
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,726
<i>ANNOUNCEMENT: Re: Gookmin Party General
Meeting.<br>Today 10am, Room 246 at the Main</i>

475
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,200
<i>BUILDING.<br>AGENDA: Making a Special Committee
to Improve Party Nomination System.</i>

476
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,110
These rascals! A party
general meeting is convened.

477
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,943
It seems like they will make a special
committee to change the party

478
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:25,470
nomination system, using Jin
Sang Pil's comment as a pretext.

479
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,540
<i> No. Really.</i>

480
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,420
<i>Does this make sense?</i>

481
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,720
How dare a first-term
assemblyman do such a thing?

482
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,260
<i> This...</i>

483
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,610
Well, don't go, Assemblyman Jin.
You did enough for your share.

484
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,850
How can an assemblyman <i>not</i> attend
the Assembly meeting? Don't worry.

485
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,940
Assemblyman.

486
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,820
Go back.

487
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,580
Today's General Assembly Meeting
is held behind closed doors.

488
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,850
I know, but...

489
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,448
How can you bring up changing
the party nomination system at

490
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,910
a time like this? One wrong move
and the party can break up!

491
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,270
<i>Right! Right!</i>

492
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,218
You can't just say no unreasonably!
It is

493
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,330
about time that we
discussed this in earnest.

494
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:24,880
- <i> Right! Right!<br>- No.
It's not!</i>

495
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,250
This has an intention to
tame a specific faction!

496
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,603
Not just one or two political
parties have ruined

497
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,170
themselves, playing games
with party nomination rules.

498
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,711
It's not necessary to
discuss all now! In the

499
00:32:34,723 --> 00:32:37,220
middle of tumult due to
the party nomination,

500
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,785
where is Secretary
General Baek, in charge

501
00:32:38,797 --> 00:32:40,410
of the party nomination?
Why is he not here?

502
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,970
If there is any staff on duty here,
bring Secretary General Baek right now!

503
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,480
He is on the provincial
tour right now.

504
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,800
We'd sooner believe a cat that pretends not
to have eaten a canary in its stomach.

505
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,570
There should be a limit
to his cowardice.

506
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,580
Pay attention to your words?
What do you mean by cowardly?

507
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,793
He made his recruit add
fuel to the fire and he

508
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:57,890
just enjoys seeing the
fire across the river.

509
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,230
You don't call that cowardly?

510
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,130
<i> - Yes. Right.<br>
- That make no sense.</i>

511
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,760
Excuse me!

512
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,500
Hearing your words, it seems I
am the recruit who made trouble.

513
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,300
This recruit wants
to say one word.

514
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,700
I have no business with
you, Assemblyman Jin.

515
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,170
Just keep sitting there. It is the middle
of this senior assemblyman's speech!

516
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,790
How can I keep listening to your
nonsense, Senior Assemblyman?

517
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,750
What?

518
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,760
Please do not lower your speech.

519
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,940
I... for real...

520
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,910
am not saying this because someone
told me to. I am sincerely speaking.

521
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,970
You know why the citizens
don't vote much?

522
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,508
Whether it's the ruling or an
opposition party, you kick up such dust

523
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,070
during every party nomination season.
Because they hate your uproar...

524
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,930
<i> - Yes. Right.<br>
- That makes no sense.</i>

525
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,870
Surely, when it is time
for the party nomination,

526
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:59,900
someone, surely, will bring up resurrecting
someone while killing off somebody else...

527
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,980
Arguing like that, you will
surely fight over the spots.

528
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,560
Yes?

529
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,770
Oh really!

530
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,750
If we don't want to disappoint
our citizens this time,

531
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,835
whether it's the top-down
nomination system, which

532
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:16,640
we have right now, or
Open Pri-- or something,

533
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,960
or whatever... LISTEN!!

534
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,860
This time, let's do our homework and come
up with a proper party nomination system!

535
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,390
Now, a first-term newbie with the ink on
his election certificate still drying,

536
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:39,130
are you impertinently preaching to
your sunbae assemblymen here or what?

537
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,980
You got that right. I
am preaching right now.

538
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,310
What is he saying now?!

539
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:46,560
No, really, that rascal!

540
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,160
There is no other way for that bastard!
Let me go!

541
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,720
Let go of me! Assemblyman
Jin, come here!

542
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,810
Ahjussi, you should
come over here.

543
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,860
What? There is no way I
am letting you off today.

544
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,520
What are you going to do
if you won't let me off?

545
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,660
Those are Kang Sang Ho
and Jin Sang Pil, right?

546
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,590
- <i>I said, let go of me.</i>
<br>- Hold it in please.

547
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,080
Let him go. Let's see what he does. You
three look like The Three Stooges.

548
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,350
Hey, Jin Sang Pil, for a guy who
used to be a welder at a factory...

549
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,280
What did you say?! Such a rude bastard!
Come here, you punk!

550
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,440
What? A factory?

551
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,830
What is wrong with a factory? What
is wrong with welding? Huh?!!!

552
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,640
This rascal is..

553
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,520
You need a national license to
do that.<br>Do you even know that?

554
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,260
Do you have any such license? At
the most, you might have a driver

555
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:34,270
license, gotten after about 10 fails.
Just by looking at you, I can tell.

556
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,998
Hey, this puppet for the
Pro-BH Faction! The only

557
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,860
thing moving alive on your
body is your mouth! Punk!

558
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,852
If I am the Pro-BH faction's
puppet, are you the

559
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:45,500
Anti-BH faction's avatar?
Have you seen it?

560
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,755
I'm asking you whether you've seen
that movie "Avatar." Probably

561
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:50,000
not, because you were busy being
entertained and playing around!

562
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,310
What? Entertained?
Play around?<br>Let me go!

563
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:58,170
- You really... <br>- STOP!

564
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:06,760
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

565

A special committee to improve
the nomination system.

566
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,370
Let's create one.

567

Assemblyman Park!

568
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,540
But...

569
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,390
if you don't do the
job properly...

570
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,350
I am not going to just
sit still and watch.

571
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,840
Assemblyman Jin.

572
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,580
You will regret today.

573
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,970
Let's do this properly.

574
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,850
Please leave.

575
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:02,380
You did well. The Secretary
General will be very happy.

576
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,790
The Anti-BH faction has agreed to
installation of a special committee.

577
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:22,370
Aide Choi, without any
manners, what are you doing?

578
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:27,790
Today, I am here not as Assemblyman Jin's
aide, but as Secretary General's hoobae.

579
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,570
Chief Im, please go outside.

580
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,520
Ok, what is that you
want to say to me?

581
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,610
Were you always this
cruel, Sunbae-nim?

582
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,870
Why am I cruel?

583
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,634
Wasn't it enough for you
to use Assemblyman Jin

584
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:50,200
as your 1-year frontman
in Gyeongjae City?

585
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,271
Now you're using him
as Pro-BH faction's

586
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:54,570
hitman as well. That is
why I am speaking up.

587
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,950
I am asking you. He
is a pitiful person.

588
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,680
Do not step on him even more.

589
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,770
When you fearlessly asked me for the
strategic nomination in Gyeongjae City,

590
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,753
I thought you had changed
a little bit.<br>But in

591
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:16,580
the end, In Kyung, you
have not changed at all.

592
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,880
What are you trying to say?

593
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,260
It was when I first got to know the
Elder in the Blue House now...

594
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,280
So I guess it's been about 9 years.
You came to see me and

595
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,190
talked very cheerfully.

596
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,770
That you had gotten a divorce and
you could not bear the loneliness.

597
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,260
So that you would get
remarried to politics.

598
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,930
Why are you talking
about that...

599
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,890
all of a sudden?

600
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,470
I liked the lights
in your eyes then.

601
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,830
Because they were still bathed in the same
pureness from our college circle days.

602
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:56,560
If I use a person like this as my staff,
then I would not go astray in the future...

603
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,180
That's what I thought
it would be like.

604
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,760
So?

605
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,390
However, that kind of
pureness cannot be a leader's

606
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:08,790
quality even though it
may be a staff member's.

607
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:13,050
A leader is required to be cruel
at times and cold at times.

608
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,960
Not only did I change, but you have
also changed too much, Sunbae-nim.

609
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,740
In Kyung...

610
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,950
if you really want the wear the badge,
learn how to be cold and calculating.

611
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,580
Don't be swayed by
cheap compassion.

612
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,400
But what is, doing what will
bring benefits to you...

613
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,960
Think about that strategically
and act on it dispassionately.

614
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,720
Sunbae-nim.

615
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,550
If you can't do that,

616
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,420
you will probably stay a
staff member forever.

It was such an honor to listen
to your learned lecture.

629
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,730
Nothing at all.

help to Assemblyman Jin.

Yes, then, please go in.

636
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,160
Is it? Thank you.

637
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,890

641
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,820
Yes, the car is parked there.

642
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,753

watch, take it, or

643

give it to Da Jeong.

assemblyman was studying.

666

Just like the assemblyman,

667
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,810
you want to cram-study politics?

00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,460
Why are you holding a camera?

671
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,790
Are you already suffering
from an occupational hazard?

672
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:16,290
You don't have to walk around
cradling it like that.

673
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,438
<i>TO FOLLOW UP: Confirm any payback.
Check if any sponsored</i>

674
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,060
<i>bill or work for constituents
is related to SOI...</i>

675
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,860
Aish, he should smile a little.
His eyes are intimidating.

676
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,490
Look at those old farts...

677
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,882
- I will first check with the
authorities and contact you.<br>-

678
00:46:14,894 --> 00:46:16,620
Please take care of this for
us, no matter what, Ms. Aide.

679
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,780
Yes, I will try. Good-bye.

680
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,620
Aide.

681
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,630
We are from the Korean Businessmen's
Federation.<br>Can we briefly meet with...

682
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:36,370
Oh... Can you wait a bit?
Please sit.

683
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,340
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil</i>

684
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,600
Aide Choi?

685
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,390
Reporter Kim.

686
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,220
Is there any good
information from the Party?

687
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,640
-There isn't any.<br>-Come on, you
said you'll give me some sources.

688
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,000
I have to take back a
kill to the editor.

689
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,210
It's not something I
can manage overnight.

690
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,640
Sunbae Choi... I
said I'll do it.

691
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,260
Wait just a bit.
I'll do it for you.

692
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,570
- Where are Aide Seo and
Secretary Sim?!<br>- Huh?

693
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:26,840
These guys really...
-Yes.<br>-Yes.

694
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,090
Thank you.

695
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,990
To save your face, Director,

696
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,430
I will just overlook this case.

697
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,290
Oh, thank you.

698
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,860
The trouble with Aide Seo is
that he has too good a heart.

699
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:46,820
If you are really
thankful, next time,

700
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,710
let's have a round
of golf together.

701
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,920
That's not even hard.

702
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,600
But, Aide-nim, you should start gradually
thinking about wearing a badge, too.

703
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,510
Aigoo, for that mere thing!
What is that, anyway?

704
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,910
All things considered, life...

705
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,870
is best lived thinly

706
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:11,500
and long. <i>(BETTER TO LAST LONG AS A NOBODY
RATHER THAN DIE EARLY AS A SOMEBODY.)</i>

707
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,380
Now, let's drink to that.

708
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,040
Is there a fire or something?

709
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,350
Oh, Sunbae.

710
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,380
Why are you in such hurry?

711
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,320
- It's time that my assemblyman would
be returning.<br>- Working so hard.

712
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,060
Why would you be so loyal to a
hooligan like Jin Sang Pil?

713
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,555
Still, he's the assemblyman
your hoobae is

714
00:48:33,567 --> 00:48:35,250
assisting.<br>That expression
is a bit too much.

715
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,025
Am I Hong Gil Dong's (fictional character from a Joseon
novel, famous for the expression of "not being able

716
00:48:38,037 --> 00:48:40,850
to call his father father" because he was illegitimate)
brother not to be able to call a hooligan a hooligan?

717
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,310
I met a reporter who frequents the
ruling party office over lunch.

718
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:45,970
- Do you know what he calls
Jin Sang Pil?<br>- What?

719
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:47,690
Do Hyeon's pet dog.

720
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,560
- What?<br>- My beloved
hoobae, In Kyung.

721
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,220
Why do you live like this?

722
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:02,560
Yes, So Min, why?

723
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,580
<i>Where are you?
Come back quickly!</i>

724
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:10,490
Moreover, Kim Bok Soo, Chairman of Korea
Industrial Development Corporation,

725
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,530
interfered with the Assembly
Hall remodeling job and

726
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:17,420
ordered an illegal contract to
be entered with a named company.

727
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:23,640
He is accused of receiving an enormous
kickback from the construction company.

728
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,320
<i>It's the Secretary
General's instructions.</i>

729
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,870
<i>Kim Bok Soo, make him lose the
election, no matter what.</i>

730
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,310
As such, I hereby demand

731
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:39,180
Chairman Kim's
immediate resignation

732
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,720
and the prosecution's

733
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,150
rigorous investigation.

734
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,912
Chairman Kim was the only remaining
chairman of a state-owned

735
00:49:47,924 --> 00:49:50,250
corporation from the
administration before the last.

736
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,210
Is there, by any chance, some political
motive behind this exposure?

737
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:57,780
<i>What political motive when I
am calling a wrong a wrong?<i></i></i>

738
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,560
<i>I didn't speak falsely.</i>

739
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,190
It would be better if he
doesn't hurt someone.

740
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,740
Isn't that right, Aide Choi?

741
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,890
In regards to improving
the nomination process,

742
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,880
did you see the list
of assemblymen?

743
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,610
I saw it. It wasn't too bad.

744
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:22,480
He was bothered that
he did use a trick.

745
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,930
Although our side is one
person short on the committee,

746
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:29,270
if it's that close, we could
just sign off on it, right?

747
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:35,080
This time, I will have to sign off on it
<br> directly with Secretary General Baek.

748
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,780
What?

749
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,220
You see, I have to collect
some amendments from him.

750
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,460
I know what you're
going to say, but

751
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,460
since I don't feel that good,

752
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,780
let's take it easy today.

753
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,190
Really! Are you going to
legislate in this crappy manner?

754
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,510
I asked you to take it easy.

755
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:17,180
I want to know why you
are overdoing things.

756
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,600
Overdoing what?

757
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,780
The reason why you knelt
before Secretary General Baek.

758
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,280
Without distinguishing whether it's fire or
water, the reason for being overly loyal!

759
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,230
There's nothing like that.

760
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,160
Then, I'll ask you
something else.

761
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,220
The fact that you
have become a slave,

762
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,190
-how does it
feel?<br>-Look here!

763
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:58,580
You said a while ago that I can't make
the kind of laws that I want to make.

764
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,553
So, if you do it this way,
did Secretary General

765
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:04,610
say that he was going to
make those laws for you?!

766
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:06,410
Probably not.

767
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,510
Because he won't like
those kinds of laws.

768
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,760
Then, why are you
being this way?

769
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,240
Secretary General can
do other things.

770
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,040
What do you mean other things?

771
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,590
The nomination.

772
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,880
With the pathetic
state I am in...

773
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,010
I can't do anything in
the next 10 months.

774
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,560
Even if I died and woke up.

775
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:45,670
I am going to get the
nomination regardless.

776
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,150
Since I poured out my heart...

777
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:59,920
so that I can get the
nomination, Aide Choi...

778
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,150
help me.

779
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,170
If you had contacted me, I
would have gone to see you.

780
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,250
The one who is thirsty goes
to find the well for water.

781
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,663
First of all... I am
sorry you raised out of

782
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:38,920
the blue an issue in
the nomination process

783
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:44,370
which was scheduled to be
discussed later in the year.

784
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,320
I'll keep your regret in mind.

785
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,530
I'm not very adept at
managing the party factions.

786
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:56,220
In any case, I am willing to endorse...

787
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,540
whichever candidates you propose
to sit on the special committee.

788
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,930
Seeing that you're caving in so easily,
I expect there are strings attached.

789
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,650
We really do speak the same language.

790
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,430
-Please say it.<br>-Because
we were ambushed,

791
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,930
we were helpless when we were attacked.

792
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:24,220
Judging from the current attitude, you can
count on a battle for future nominations.

793
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,370
But considering our morale at the
moment, a fight is meaningless.

794
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,514
If it can somehow be done
what do you think will

795
00:54:31,526 --> 00:54:34,100
improve the attitude of
the Anti-BH faction?

796
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,840
Cutting off the neck of the
main opponent would do it.

797
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,660
Jin Sang Pil.

798
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:50,130
Can you omit Jin Sang Pil...

799
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,160
for the next election's nominations?

800
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,970
Assemblyman, I have
something to report to you.

801
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:21,690
Why didn't you go home yet?

802
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:25,090
I was going through the contribution
funds account summaries and it seems...

803
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:28,190
there is $100 from your wife.

804
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,320
Gyeong Ah did?

805
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,440
Hyung, please get the car.

806
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,120
Why didn't you get off work?

807
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,720
Yes. I was looking at some of
the National Assembly records.

808
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,660
Secretary Kim is seriously
diligently studying.

809
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,400
You know how to eat meat, right?

810
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,350
Yes.

811
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:02,580
Secretary Kim, you really
have a great appetite.

812
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,310
He eats well.

813
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:08,460
Ah that's right; but Secretary
Kim, where's your hometown?

814
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,820
It's Busan.

815
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,180
Really?

816
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,980
But seeing you closely, I feel
like I have seen you somewhere.

817
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,170
What?

818
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:25,020
Oh no, I think you seem familiar,

819
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,860
but depending how I look, you
don't seem familiar as well.

820
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,560
I do hear that often, since my
facial impression is a bit ordinary.

821
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,800
<i>Dae Bak!</i>

822
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,610
Joo Hee!

823
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:42,060
It's meat! It's meat!

824
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,700
I'm so hungry. I thought
I would faint and die.

825
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,570
Hey! Wash your hands first and then eat.

826
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,640
You act just like your dad. Eat
slowly and little by little.

827
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,470
Look at her eat.

828
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,190
Hi.

829
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,630
Hello.

830
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,490
You look cute. Eat a lot.

831
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,850
Why did you donate? You
don't earn much as it is.

832
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,800
I did it, since Joo Hee
asked me to do it together.

833
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,400
Do you want to live together again?

834
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:34,210
I'm sorry, but I don't have
the confidence to do that.

835
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,010
Why don't you feel confident?

836
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,520
You don't have to wash the
dishes at a funeral or

837
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,850
wash women's backs in the bath house
like you did a long time ago.

838
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:46,220
Even if you do it, I won't let you.
Don't worry.

839
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,600
It's not that.

840
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,720
Then what is it?

841
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,180
I just think you're a different person.

842
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,260
What?

843
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,850
You come out on the TV news and

844
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,850
are someone who just glares
after uncovering corruption.

845
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,690
You're not the person I used to know.

846
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:08,940
What are you talking about? I am still
THE SAME: Jin Sang Pil the welder.

847
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:15,520
Honestly, I want to be called
Madam and live a nice life.

848
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,930
But I'm scared.

849
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:20,230
Because you might tell me that
you want to break up again.

850
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:31,250
Okay then. I'll wait until
you get comfortable.

851
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:35,310
Go inside. I'll go.

852
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,410
Go.

853
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,540
<i>A strange list appeared a bit ago.</i>

854
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,560
<i>Please look it over.</i>

855
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,640
What's the important problem?

856
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,810
It's this.

857
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,500
What is this?

858
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:52,340
It's a list of 28 currently elected
assemblymen of Gookmin Party.

859
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,560
-So?<br>-Most are too old,

860
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,970
or with bad legislative track records,

861
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:01,390
or with previous corruption records.
By looking at the list,

862
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,180
I am pretty sure that it's a 'hit list".

863
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,050
A hit list?

864
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:10,330
It's a list of people who won't be
getting the nomination next election.

865
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:14,340
Probably due to someone's mistake,
I think the list was leaked.

866
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,750
<i>List of names for D Group</i>

867
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:34,490
But your name is also on it.

868
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:41,790
<i>Jin Sang Pil.<i></i></i>

869
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:05,130
<i>Next year, I will be running
in Gyeongjae District.</i>

870
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:07,190
I am going to get the nomination.

871
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,200
Absolutely.

872
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:30,160
