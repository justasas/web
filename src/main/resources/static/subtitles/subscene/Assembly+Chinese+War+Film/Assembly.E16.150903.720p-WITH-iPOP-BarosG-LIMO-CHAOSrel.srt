00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,810
What do you want to ask me?

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,530
Oh, there is a matter we are
internally investigating.

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,550
Internal investigation?

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,340
You know Hanmin Bank?

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,870
Hanmin Bank...

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,030
You received a shopping bag with money in
it from the bank president's secretary

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,950
and delivered it to Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil, right?

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,820
Tell me, did you deliver it to
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil or not?

<i>6th Day of the
Parliamentary Inspection.</i>

12

<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

<i>Episode 16.</i>

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,190
Dong Cheon.<br>- Yes.

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,470
You didn't leak this questionnaire to
the Ministry of the Environment, right?

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,350
Absolutely not.

18
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,240
Oh, wait...

19
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,448
I guess even a busy
person like you

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,510
participates in the
parliamentary inspection?

21
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,760
Because I'm an assemblyman before
being a secretary general.<br>- Yeah...

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,390
How do you find your first
parliamentary inspection? Doable?

23
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,502
Haven't you seen the
mid-term announcement from

24
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:54,770
that Parliamentary Inspection
Monitor or something?

25
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,226
I made the candidate
list for being the best

26
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:59,870
assemblyman during the
parliamentary inspection.

27
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,090
That deserves congratulations.

28
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,670
Shall I tell you one more thing
I should be congratulated on?

29
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,210
Our party conducted a public opinion
poll in Gyeongje City yesterday.

30
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,750
Secretary General, you
got 35% and I, 58%.

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,930
Public opinion is like a lover just before
jilting you. Don't count on it too much.

32
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,310
Didn't I tell you before

33
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,660
that I would never lose to you,
if only for Hyung Dal Soo's sake?

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,510
I... will trample you.

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,520
There is a fact that you
must be aware of, too.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,160
That this inspection is the first and
last parliamentary inspection for you.

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,120
Ah... just one look
and I can tell

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,900
you are brewing some stinking sh*t.
I better be careful.

39
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,490
Then.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,330
<i>2015 Parliamentary Inspection by
Environment and Labor Committee.</i>

41
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,510
See this, okay? See
this right now.

42
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,030
These are the numbers
showing marine pollution

43
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,340
due to the industrial
wastewater in Gyeongje City.

44
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,270
Look, in BOD from 5

45
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:22,170
to 16.4, 4.5 to 18.95 in COD.
Take a look!

46
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,850
How many times is this!

47
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,650
Are you going to kill them all?

48
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,810
Are you crazy?!

49
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,530
What are you doing not
managing these things!

50
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,290
Are you going to kill
everyone in Gyeongje City?

51
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,560
Don't touch the glasses!

52
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,870
I'll give this to you, so
take it home and study it.

53
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,690
Take a very careful look.

54
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,450
Frame it, put it up on the
wall and study it everyday.

55
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,110
Play it, Secretary Park.

56
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,620
A group of experts,
my staff and I

57
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,150
personally went down to Gyeongje
River and tested the water quality.

58
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,450
Our Director of Korea Water Quality
Management Company, take a look.

59
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,870
Take a good look. Is
that a river now?

60
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,390
Huh?

61
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,260
Does that look like a river?
What do you see?

62
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,690
Does it seem like sewage water?

63
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,890
Do you think that was
pumped from a septic tank?

64
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,667
That is none other than the
Gyeongje River. The current.

65
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,970
Gyeongje River where all
fishes have died out!

66
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,310
Huh?! What are you
going to do about it?

67
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,710
What are you going to do about all those
fishes? You hurry and revive them now!

68
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,250
Moving on to the next one.

69
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,010
Do you see that, huh?

70
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,370
Are you tending a green tea
field in the river, now?

71
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,290
Green tea field, green tea field?
What are you going to do?

72
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,190
What kind of management work
are you doing, seriously!

73
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,570
Stop fidgeting with your glasses.
Why do you, why...

74
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,000
I even personally
brought a sample.

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,650
Do you see this? I thought you
might not believe it. I didn't

76
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:25,200
put anything in it, I just
ladled this out, personally.

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,650
Taste it.

78
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,860
Here, this too. You are
getting plenty today.

79
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,130
Why are we not prepared?

80
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,130
Are you sticking it to me?

81
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,670
From tomorrow until the end of
the parliamentary inspection,

82
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:49,150
prepare all questionnaires like that.
Go back to your seat.

83
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,880
Only my aides can do it. Not
everyone is capable of that.

84
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,310
And do you admit this levee construction
in Gyeongje City was done shoddily?

85
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,530
It wasn't shoddy work.

86
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,710
Not shoddy work? Are you sure?

87
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,770
You can get punished for perjury during a
parliamentary inspection. Don't you know?

88
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,910
Seeing how you're touching your
glasses, it is a lie. Fine.

89
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,770
I will read you all of the
materials I prepared.

90
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,190
First... Ah, ah, ah. Chairwoman,
please give me more time.

91
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,170
Enough already. Other assemblymen
have to question too.

92
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,590
But I have to do everything I prepared.
When I came with this much preparation...

93
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,530
If you do everything at the
beginning, what does that make us?

94
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,435
Are you the only one
doing the parliamentary

95
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:41,450
inspection? When we've
prepared as much as you?

96
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,560
Wow, between fellow party
members, you're so petty.

97
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,941
Assemblyman Jin, I
will give you my five

98
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:51,760
minutes of additional question time.
Use that.

99
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Aigo, thank you, Assemblywoman Cheon!
Aigo, thank you.

100
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,240
Did you see that? When even an opposition
party assemblywoman is like that?

101
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,260
But please give it to me
quickly, the 5 minutes?

102
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,980
Oh, it's working well.

103
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,020
Witness, from now on,
to the questions I ask

104
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,860
answer in no uncertain terms.
Understand?

105
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,080
Are you really not going
to submit the materials?

106
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,740
Don't you know this is against the
Board of Audit and Inspection Act?

107
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,700
What? A meal?

108
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,820
That place's taste has changed, unlike
the good old times. But I know...

109
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,380
Now, did I ask for a meal or materials?
It's not like I'm going around hungry.

110
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,760
Send them to me by midnight.
Hang up.

111
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,980
But what do they
take an aide for?

112
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,380
Rain, rain. Eat the rain man.

113
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,160
Which one do I eat? Which one?

114
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,480
Of course you have to eat ssangpi.
That's right!

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,540
Rain ssangpi.

116
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,740
That's right.

117
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
What are you doing?

118
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm just taking a breather
from making press materials.

119
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,500
I'm going to go to Aide
Choi and tell on you.

120
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,500
It's fun, right? Right?

121
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,620
So much fun. You can't
lose the money I've won.

122
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,040
I got it, I got it.

123
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,540
Just because they don't have to work on
questionnaires, they are being too much.

124
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,860
Yes, why?

125
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,000
<i>Environment and Labor
Committee<br>Meeting Room.</i>

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,571
Aide Seo, you did write a
questionnaire to support companies

127
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,700
with innovative environmental
technologies, right?

128
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,160
Yes, but why?

129
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,320
But the Assemblyman
does not have it.

130
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,000
What did you say?

131
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,160
When I worked so hard to
make this questionnaire,

132
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
how can you take this out?

133
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,520
It does not fit the tone of the
Assemblyman's legislative activities.

134
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,453
But that the government should
give some support to companies

135
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:07,840
that come up with cutting-edge
new technologies...

136
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,380
Why does that not fit
the Assemblyman's tone?

137
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,760
It does not fit.

138
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,230
Look here, Aide Choi.
Even though you're the

139
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:17,780
senior aide, this is
exceeding your authority.

140
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,760
I'm in charge of questionnaires.

141
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,000
I was not going to
bring this up, but

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,440
that questionnaire. Didn't a new technology
company solicit you to write it?

143
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,080
What? What do you take me for...

144
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,024
Special interest
legislation after getting

145
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,220
lobbied for it, that is
not the only evil thing.

146
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,478
Making special interest
questionnaires like this one after

147
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,760
getting solicitations, that
practice also has to disappear!

148
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,840
Since the Assemblyman does
not know about this, be

149
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:51,260
careful not to repeat this
sort of thing in the future.

150
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,461
What do you mean the
Assemblyman doesn't know?

151
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:58,230
Do you even know who
that company owner is?

152
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,120
Who?<br>- President
Lee Taek Jo of SOI.

153
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,080
Lee Taek Jo?

154
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,680
I mean that $5000 designer watch that
almost cost Secretary Kim his job...

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,880
The person who gave that.

156
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
The Assemblyman
returned that watch.

157
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,240
Who returned what now?

158
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,700
When the giver says he
didn't get it back.

159
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,340
What?<br>- How could I stick it out
without writing him that questionnaire?

160
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,320
<i>Give it to me. I will
return it to President Lee.</i>

161
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,260
<i>It's okay. The punk who
received it must return it.</i>

162
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Parliamentary inspection
is no small job.

163
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,740
Really...

164
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,480
Aide Choi, get me Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi's address.

165
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
So I can try to see her.

166
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,680
Give me an honest answer to the
question I'm about to ask.

167
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,900
Why are you like this again
all of a sudden? What is it?

168
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,059
What did you do with
that designer watch you

169
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,000
had received from
President Lee Taek Jo?

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,780
I got cash for it and bought
bread for homeless people.

171
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,460
Don't joke around!

172
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,420
I'm not joking.

173
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,640
You are not joking?

174
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,100
If you don't believe
me, ask Gyu Hwan.

175
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,880
He worked like a dog for
several days because of that.

176
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,080
Didn't you say you
exchange emails everyday?

177
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,690
Why don't you just confess?

178
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,130
From a trustworthy source,

179
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,527
we got very detailed information
about your involvement

180
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,690
in the delivery of the bribe
before summoning you.

181
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:38,310
<i>Because I was not convinced by Chief
Secretary Lim's transcript alone,</i>

182
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,110
<i>I put temptation in the
Assemblyman's way.</i>

183
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,470
Pleading the fifth, may get
you left holding the bag.

184
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,370
Fine. Why don't you
just leave for today?

185
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,710
Take out money from the
Assemblyman's salary

186
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,370
tomorrow and buy the exact same watch
as the one President Lee gave.

187
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,150
Okay.

188
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,670
Forget it, why do that?

189
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,840
You stay quiet, Assemblyman.

190
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,340
Clearly you have violated
the Political Funds Act.

191
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,110
But, just... It's
just, it's okay.

192
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,940
If I had that kind of money, I'd
rather buy my Joo Hee some clothes.

193
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,280
Would it have been any
better to do that?

194
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,860
Are you some sort of a benevolent thief who
robs from the rich to give to the poor?

195
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,620
Why did you buy homeless
people bread, why?

196
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,372
Then, should I have bought
those people in poor health

197
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,020
alcohol? Of course I should
have bought them bread.

198
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,060
Assemblyman!

199
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,320
I am sorry. At that
time, I did not know

200
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,900
that things would
get this serious.

201
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,380
You just try this one more time.
Then, I'm really going to cane you.

202
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,640
Me too.

203
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,970
7769? Call.

204
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,570
<i>Who is it?</i>

205
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,488
Oh, hello. I am Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil, the.

206
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,430
People's Spoilsport who
always tries his best.

207
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,250
Is Assemblywoman Hong
home, by any chance?

208
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,830
<i>No, she is not.</i>

209
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,290
Oh, really? Then, do you by
any chance know where...

210
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,100
Hello?

211
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,060
Hello!

212
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,400
What the...

213
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,720
Does this run in her family?
Why hang up so suddenly?

214
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,120
Seriously...

215
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,032
Yes, this is Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil, the.

216
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:04,680
People's Spoilsport who
always tries his best.

217
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,980
Assemblyman.

218
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,070
Oh, it's you, Gyu Hwan.

219
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,210
Yes.

220
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,050
Okay,

221
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,750
have you been well?

222
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,310
Where are you right now?

223
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,290
Hey, punk, while an elder is

224
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,190
greeting you, how can you
abruptly ask for the whereabouts?

225
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,270
Punk, do you really want
to get some beating?

226
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,490
I said where are you!

227
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,270
I am out to meet
someone, happy, punk?

228
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,550
I would like to see you now.

229
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,710
Now?

230
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,090
Gyu Hwan, let's meet
at home.<br>- Assemblyman!

231
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:46,540
I'll get home soon, so let's meet at
home in a little bit. I've got to go.

232
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,280
Assemblywoman Hong!

233
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,970
How can an assemblywoman
not come to the Assembly?

234
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,670
Because you are not even showing your
face in the inspection hearings,

235
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,130
reporters and NGOs are up in arms
about that, do you know that?

236
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,410
I am prepared to be reviled.

237
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,390
During my press conference to announce
my resignation, I will return my salary

238
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
and apologize to the people.

239
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,070
Are you really going to resign?

240
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,830
Yes.

241
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,950
No, don't do that. Just join
Indifferent-to-BH faction.

242
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,520
I will be good to you.

243
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,040
I guess you're mistaken because
I opposed your expulsion.

244
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,480
But at that time, just
out of embarrassment...

245
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,480
I did that because I didn't
want to be embarrassed.

246
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,220
It's okay if you do not join
Indifferent-to-BH faction.

247
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,220
But isn't quitting the
Assembly too much?

248
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,360
When the people put you there.

249
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,580
The people

250
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,360
put me there?

251
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
Of course.

252
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,400
No.

253
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,520
I was just the newest model...

254
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,400
the brand-new latest product.

255
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,420
What, newest? A new model?

256
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,720
During the general
election 4 years ago,

257
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,780
displayed in a window of the
shop called the Gookmin Party,

258
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,780
the latest item with a glitzy
design but of unproven quality!

259
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,680
That was Hong Chan Mi.

260
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,990
Why do you torment
yourself like that?

261
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,550
What's wrong with you, when
you are pretty and smart?

262
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,290
You talk well. You're diligent.

263
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,110
It's just your personality
that is a bit...

264
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,644
When I was selected as a
proportional representative

265
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:58,790
and entered the Assembly
with high expectations

266
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,330
I heard the words the staff and reporters
were whispering behind my back.

267
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,470
What did they say?

268
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,370
Hong Chan Mi, a pretty face
put on the general election.

269
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,110
Hong Chan Mi who picked
up a windfall gold badge.

270
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,150
Sooner or later, she
will fall out of fashion

271
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,714
and after 4 years, Hong
Chan Mi will be flung

272
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:21,470
into a pile of drastically
discounted sale goods.

273
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,310
Yes, so that may be why

274
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:30,710
I was so hung up on
getting a nomination.

275
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,690
Because I didn't want to
acknowledge what was said,

276
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,940
But...

277
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,350
But, truthfully, I,

278
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,030
Hong Chan Mi, I was
really the worst.

279
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:56,010
You still have a lot of time.
The game is not over yet.

280
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:05,760
Muster up courage and
let's walk together.

281
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,480
Okay?

282
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,480
But, Assemblywoman Hong...
Frankly, I...

283
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,120
do not dislike you,
Assemblyman Jin.

284
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,300
But when I see you, I
feel very uncomfortable.

285
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:26,010
Am I that shabby?

286
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,680
Our Aide Choi didn't speak
harshly, to that extent at least.

287
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,860
I want to quickly
forget how cheap I was.

288
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,040
But when I see you, I cannot.

289
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,290
What?

290
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,910
Let us never see
each other again.

291
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,990
Assemblywoman Hong!

292
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,180
Kim Gyu Hwan.

293
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,700
What are you going to do when
you see Assemblyman Jin?

294
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,320
Whatever I do, what
business of yours is it?

295
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,820
Just now,

296
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,660
I got a statement from the Hanmin Bank
employee who delivered the bribe to you.

297
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,220
That is a lie. I do not
know anything about this.

298
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,120
Mr. Kim Gyu Hwan, you
are under arrest.

299
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,580
<i>Secretary General, Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil is now like a cornered rat.</i>

300
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,490
Secretary General?

301
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,780
Do Hyeon, is something
bothering you?

302
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,430
Eh, punk.

303
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,340
How did I end up like this?

304
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,370
What are you talking about?

305
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:25,250
No, it's just... that
thought came to me.

306
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,000
I understand that your pride is
hurt because of Jin Sang Pil.

307
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,140
But don't worry about that rascal.
I will cut him out.

308
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,920
No need for that.

309
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,530
Because it's coming
to an end now.

310
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,970
You, do you want to be jailed?

311
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,150
That will be a huge obstacle if
you want to be a civil servant.

312
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,651
Everything is bound to come
out when cross-examination

313
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:11,350
is conducted and the CCTV
footage is analyzed.

314
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,510
Answer me. You
received it, right?

315
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,550
Yes, I received it.

316
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,370
You delivered it to Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil, right?

317
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,780
Yes.

318
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,763
Yes, Prosecutor. Kim Gyu
Hwan says he delivered

319
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:45,210
the money to Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil.

320
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,590
But the Assemblyman must have returned the
money. You're doing all this for nothing!

321
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,920
But the giver says he
never got it back.

322
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,190
What?

323
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,620
Sang Pil, can't we
just eat first?

324
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,070
But we have to eat together
with Gyu Hwan when he comes.

325
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,260
The stew and all
this will get cold.

326
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,740
Then we can re-heat them.

327
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,520
<i>Your call is not answered and will
be connected to the voicemail box...</i>

328
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,200
Why isn't he answering?

329
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,480
Do you think maybe he got into a
car accident on his way here?

330
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,341
Don't say such an unlucky thing.
Three spits

331
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:32,060
(AND WHAT YOU SAID
WILL NEVER COME TRUE).

332
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,895
Besides this questionnaire,
is there any other

333
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:38,990
favor you did for
President Lee Taek Jo?

334
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,360
No.

335
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,880
Delete the questionnaire
file right away.

336
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,280
Okay, I understand.

337
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,900
Who are you people?

338
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,540
What are you doing right now?

339
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,910
We are from the Central
District Prosecutors' Office.

340
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,360
<i>Search and Seizure Warrant.</i>

341
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,590
Please cooperate with
our search and seizure.

342
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,730
You didn't even take
off your shoes.

343
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,720
No...

344
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,870
<i>It's okay if you do not join
Indifferent-to-BH faction.</i>

345
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,680
<i>But isn't quitting the
Assembly too much?</i>

346
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,060
<i>When the people put you there.</i>

347
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,206
<i>Last evening, the Seoul
Central District.</i>

348
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,460
<i>Prosecutors' Office carried
out a search and seizure</i>

349
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,750
<i>of Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's
residence and Assembly office.</i>

350
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,720
Bribe?<br><i>- During the past Babel Tower
City bankruptcy scandal, Assemblyman Jin</i>

351
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,400
<i>met Hanmin Bank President
Kim Doo Shik who had sold</i>

352
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:56,000
<i>his wife, a Mrs. Kim, a
share of the related fund,</i>

353
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,540
<i>and by threatening him
with service of a subpoena</i>

354
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,740
<i>to a parliamentary investigation, allegedly
extorted $20,000 of illegal money from him.</i>

355
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,170
Yes, it is true that I... met
with Bank President Kim.

356
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,890
And

357
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,883
it is also true that
I told him I would

358
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:21,420
subpoena him to a
parliamentary investigation.

359
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:31,210
However, it is nonsense that I acted
with the intent to extort money.

360
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,566
<i>The prosecution immediately
arrested Assemblyman Jin's former</i>

361
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:37,720
<i>secretary, a Mr. Kim, and
questioned him on related facts.</i>

362
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,970
<i>Mr. Kim allegedly stated that
he had delivered the money</i>

363
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,186
<i>he got from Bank
President Kim's side to.</i>

364
00:25:43,198 --> 00:25:45,860
<i>Assemblyman Jin in the
bank's underground garage.</i>

365
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,880
It is true that the money
was delivered to me.

366
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,500
But that very day, I met Bank President
Kim and returned it right away.

367
00:25:51,500 --> 00:26:01,000
Directly. Frankly, because my
wife and daughter were on my mind

368
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,090
it is true that I wavered a bit.

369
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,850
If you want to punish me for
that, I will gladly pay for it.

370
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,040
<i>From Bank President Kim's
ASSOCIATE:<br>It's true</i>

371
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,110
<i>that the Assemblyman
returned in a few hours</i>

372
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,215
<i>but Bank President said
he demanded more money</i>

373
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:16,480
<i>because it was less than
the amount his wife lost.</i>

374
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,200
<i>When he refused,
he left in a huff</i>

375
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,487
<i>and when he called for
a special prosecution</i>

376
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:21,740
<i>out of the blue, the
president was shocked.</i>

377
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,112
<i>The prosecution plans to summon
and question Assemblyman.</i>

378
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,340
<i>Jin after completing analysis
of the seized evidence.</i>

379
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,130
<i>This is KBC News...</i>

380
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,970
Wow, what a
ridiculous bastard...

381
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:35,790
After having done that,
in that press conference.

382
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,710
"Honey... I'm sorry.

383
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,580
I... am not a person who can only
look after my family, right?"

384
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,100
Didn't he say that?

385
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,180
The case feels somehow...
a bit... strange.

386
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,810
Ehhh, really.

387
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,610
The prosecution opened up the case to the
public because they feel sure about it.

388
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,130
The only thing remaining for
Jin Sang Pil now is to stand

389
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,060
in the mugshot line and
get his ID photo taken.

390
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,620
You just watch. No
doubt about it.

391
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,120
Secretary General,
congratulations.

392
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,770
You can leave now.

393
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,320
Assemblyman Jin, are you going to
respond to the prosecution's call?

394
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,810
This is the parliamentary inspection
season. I don't have time to go there.

395
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,470
Are you saying you will be unresponsive?
Please tell us!

396
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,290
Tell us.

397
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,760
Assemblyman.

398
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,800
I... cannot cooperate with the
prosecutors who only believe.

399
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,620
Bank President Kim's lies and
paint me as a shameless criminal.

400
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:56,030
If they want to see my face, they
will have to drag me there by force.

401
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,830
Just one more word.

402
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,320
Let us go in now.
Enough already.

403
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,820
I am sorry.<br>- Assemblyman!

404
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,470
We will distribute additional
press materials soon.

405
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,940
By when...<br>- We
are sorry, sorry.

406
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,590
Assemblyman!

407
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,500
Ahew, but if a wife does not tell
her husband, who does she talk to?

408
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,610
Isn't that so?

409
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,240
Don't worry and just take
good care of Joo Hee.

410
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,640
You... are really okay, right?

411
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,540
Yes, that is what I said. Our Aide
Choi said, with regard to assemblymen,

412
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,485
unless they are caught in
the middle of committing

413
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:34,600
a crime, the prosecution
can do nothing.

414
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,620
Right, that is the kind
of person I am right now.

415
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,630
So there is nothing to worry about.
Right.

416
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,960
Okay, okay, bye.

417
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,830
This matter...

418
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,400
Secretary General Baek is
behind this, no doubt.

419
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,520
Gyu Hwan... What is
happening to him?

420
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,700
It seems he's still in
the prosecutors' office.

421
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,020
Don't worry.

422
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,500
Since they have to release him within 48
hours of arrest, he will be out in no time.

423
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,340
Since I have given all my
statements, I can leave now, right?

424
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,750
Let me just confirm
one more thing.

425
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,430
What is this?<br>- We found this while
recovering data from your laptop computer.

426
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,610
Tell me what that is.

427
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,450
Okay then.

428
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,820
Did somebody die?

429
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,990
Why are you all so crestfallen?

430
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,950
You can't possibly be thinking that
I pocketed that money, can you?

431
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:39,780
There is no one here
who thinks that.

432
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,750
Da Jeong, why are you crying?

433
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:49,530
It's just that... I'm so mad at
these absurd things taking place.

434
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,750
I am sorry.

435
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,250
Don't cry. Why cry?

436
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,970
Your Assemblyman won't
even bat an eye at this.

437
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,130
Secretary Song, how are
the netizens' responses?

438
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,290
Half on the Assemblyman's side,
half on the prosecution's side.

439
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,060
Good, that is plenty.

440
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,110
Aide Seo.<br>- Yes.

441
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,162
Please work with Secretary Sim
and Da Jeong to wrap up the

442
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:16,030
parliamentary inspection that
is soon coming to an end.

443
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,510
I got it.

444
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,060
Everyone else will work with
me to wage a nationwide

445
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:24,230
campaign asserting the
Assemblyman's innocence.

446
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,430
But will it work with just us?

447
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:33,150
Just now, Jin Ji Mo leaders all over the
nation called saying they would help out

448
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,270
together with the
fan club members.

449
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,110
Really?<br>- Uh huh.

450
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,780
See? Even if the sky caves in on you,
there will be a way out of it for us.

451
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,750
There are people who believe
in JSP till the end!

452
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,270
So let us cheer up and
fight for it. Aja!

453
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,590
Aja.

454
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:55,870
Eh, why are you guys like this, really?
Louder! Aja aja!

455
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,970
Aja, aja, aja!<br>-
Scorchhh...

456
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,050
What is scorchhh?

457
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:06,650
Assemblyman, the designer watch
President Lee Taek Jo gave you...

458
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,910
just came up in an article.

459
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,470
Huh?

460
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,160
<i>Jin Sang Pil Received a Designer

463
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,490
How did they find
out about this?

464
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,560
It's Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil!<br>- I
heard that bastard is a total thief?

465
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,190
I had thought we finally got ourselves
a pretty decent assemblyman, but...

466
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,270
This is why the have-nots should
not get involved in politics.<br>- Aish!

467
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,310
Hyung, just come.

468
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,090
Hurry and come.

469
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,410
We urge that Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil be detained and investigated!

470
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,510
Even though Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil is claiming

471
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,630
that he bought bread for homeless people
with the designer watch he received,

472
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,270
he's lying through his teeth!

In a seized parliamentary inspection
questionnaire, the prosecution

00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,490
found a proposal to provide
financial support to the company

475
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,090
run by the person who
gave the designer watch!

476
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,350
A person like Jin Sang Pil...

477
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,770
Let's go quickly.

478
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,030
...should no longer waste the
people's blood-like taxes!

479
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:21,470
Everyone! Please sign the petition
for his arrest and interrogation!

<i>an arrest motion failed
to pass the Assembly.</i>

495
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:10,170
You will only get more depressed if
you keep watching this kind of news.

496
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,630
Go home early today.

497
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,230
People do not
believe what I say.

498
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,430
It's not that they
don't believe you,

499
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:27,950
but as much as they liked you,
they've received a huge shock.

500
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,610
With time, they will change.

What will happen if the legislature
passes his arrest motion?

503
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,170
Eight or nine out of ten, he
will be taken into custody.

504

Custody?

505
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,970
If things go wrong, he may not even be able
to leave jail until the end of his term.

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:15,830
No matter what, we have to block the
arrest motion from being passed.

507
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,606
What do you think about
writing to all Assembly

508
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,550
members, pleading with them
not to vote for his arrest?

509
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,290
No. If the Assemblyman
makes such a move,

510
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,973
he may get criticized for
using parliamentary immunity

511
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:28,650
against being arrested during
the session as a shield.

512
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,810
He was framed anyway, so what's
wrong with using it as a shield?

513
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,340
Insist on the injustice of
passing the arrest motion...

514
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,490
I know it is a
huge favor to ask.

515
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,315
However, the only person
who would help our.

516
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:50,550
Assemblyman right now is
you, Assemblywoman Cheon.

517
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,230
I am sorry, but that
will be difficult.

518
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,950
Assemblywoman...

519
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,690
As you know, my party's position
is that we should curtail

520
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,570
or repeal parliamentary
immunity.

521
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,270
Even though I feel sorry for
Assemblyman Jin, I am afraid I can't.

522
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,070
I am here to ask your learned opinion about
the motion to allow Jin Sang Pil's arrest.

523
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:36,080
The prosecution is too insolent.

524
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,450
They should not scoff at
the legislature like this.

525
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,830
Consider the citizens'
sentiment nowadays.

526
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,950
If it fails to pass, the whole of
the legislature will be reviled.

527
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,370
Okay, I will send a message
to Assemblyman Kang.

528
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,830
Thank you.<br>- But...

529
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:03,690
isn't this the sort of matter handled
by the floor leader?<br>- Excuse me?

530
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:08,110
Secretary General Baek...
Lately,

531
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,870
you seem to violate too often the
lane change and speed regulations.

532
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:18,110
In the past, while observing
the traffic rules,

533
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,530
you drove very cleanly too.

534
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,910
I guess lately I
feel a bit pressed.

535
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,430
I will be more careful.

536
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:39,280
At any event, I guess this is
the end of Jin Sang Pil too.

537
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,680
Dad!

538
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,310
Startled me... Hey,
how did you get here?

539
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,670
Is it true that you
will get nabbed?

540
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,670
Who told you? Who said
that I would get nabbed?

541
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,970
Then, that "allowing arrest"
thing, what is that?

542
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,150
Where did you pick that up?

543
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,990
Hey, if you are a ninth grader, then you
should ask a ninth-grader question.

544
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,650
Tell me quickly! What is that?

545
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,950
Your daddy is an assemblyman.

546
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,390
A person who does a
very important job.

547
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,529
But when Daddy is working
hard on an important job,

548
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:25,570
the police ahjussis cannot
catch Dad, willy-nilly.

549
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:30,070
They have to get all the other
assemblymen's agreement.

550
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:33,270
Then, other assemblymen
must oppose it for you.

551
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,610
That's right.

552
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,490
But, your Daddy is the most popular
one among the assemblymen.

553
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:44,970
So in terms of celebs, I am on the
same level as Ahjussi Song Hae.

554
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,690
So everyone is on
your Daddy's side.

555
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,670
You're telling me
the truth, right?

556
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,250
Truthfully. Daddy will
never get nabbed.

557
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,170
Yes.

558
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,910
<i>Aide-nim.</i>

559
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,290
Kim Gyu Hwan?

560
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,830
You've had a really
hard time, haven't you?

561
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,910
I am sorry.

562
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,030
Isn't there a way for me
to help the Assemblyman?

563
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,790
For now, laying low
is helping him.

564
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,670
Staying near the Assemblyman may

565
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:53,810
only raise the prosecution's
suspicion needlessly.

566
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,930
It's all my fault.

567
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,420
Don't blame yourself too much.

568
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,450
Even though you may have been
responsible for the luxury watch,

569
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,150
being momentarily
tempted by the money

570
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:17,600
received from the Hanmin Bank president
was the Assemblyman's fault.

571
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,570
At the time...

572
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,980
I forced the Assemblyman to
accept the money against his will

573
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:34,910
when he told me to
return it immediately.

574
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,020
What?

575
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,540
So if the Assemblyman
actually accepted it,

576
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,960
I was intending to give a tip to.

577
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,580
Chief Secretary Im Gyu Tae.

578
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,160
What do you mean Im Gyu Tae?

579
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,700
Secretary General
Baek's Chief Secretary?

580
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,200
Yes.

581
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,960
What are you saying?

582
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,970
What brings you here?

583
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,550
Is it true that

584
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,913
you incited Secretary Kim
Gyu Hwan to feed you

585
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:24,300
information about Assemblyman
Jin's corruption?

586
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,700
If it's true, is that a problem?

587
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,820
Leave.

588
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,790
You piece of trash!

589
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,490
What?

590
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,510
What is happening?

591
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,950
Secretary General Baek.

592
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,870
So you've met Gyu Hwan,
together with Secretary Lim?

593
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,790
I only met him because he said
he had information to give.

594
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:03,270
The fact is he changed
his mind and just left.

595
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,340
Like hell!

596
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,350
The real fact is

597
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:12,700
you have become a
scumbag politician

598
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,330
who goes around digging
up other people's dirt.

599
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,870
Yes.

600
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,060
That's what has
happened to me now.

601
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
And I

602
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,510
am willing to sink a lot lower
than this toward the bottom

603
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,530
if it is expedient.

604
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,640
Understand?

605
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:49,120
Get ready to provide food and supplies to
your Assemblyman when he is behind bars.

606
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:05,060
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

607
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,360
What do you mean it's difficult?

608
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,800
Why are you saying it's difficult
to consent to the arrest motion?

609
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,060
We're not the
government's minions.

610
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,970
We don't have to process
it without hesitation

611
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,960
just because they
send us a motion.

612
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,820
But we're talking about
Jin Sang Pil here.

613
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,470
Yes. Even though Jin Sang Pil has been
behaving inappropriately all this time,

614
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,770
he is a fellow assemblyman,
eating at the same table.

615
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:45,390
Strangling him with our own hands...
that's a bit... you know.

616
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:50,250
Just be honest. Something's
bothering you, right?

617
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,610
It's not me. It's
Assemblymen Choi and Nam.

618
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,500
It seems President Lee Taek
Jo fed them with something.

619
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,440
Stupid fools...

620
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,200
They say Lee Taek Jo's
wife imports watches.

621
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,700
Wow... if it seems for
their own benefit,

622
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,860
no questions asked, they just drop off
these watches to those assemblymen.

623
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,860
I'm guessing it might
be dozens who got them.

624
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,730
Did you get one too?

625
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,900
Jeez. What the heck do you see me as?
Gracious!

626
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,390
I...!

627
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,940
I returned it the day
before yesterday.

628
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:45,660
With the vote coming up, it's
developed into a headache.

629
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,190
Why suffer a headache over it?

630
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,183
Just let the assemblymen who
approve it vote to approve

631
00:44:50,195 --> 00:44:51,950
it, and the ones who oppose
it vote to oppose it.

632
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,720
Just let them vote
however they want.

633
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,040
The Anti-BH faction decided to vote
autonomously and not in a bloc today?

634
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,020
Yes. I positively heard Assemblyman
Kang Sang Ho's aide say that.

635
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,550
But why this... don't you
feel it's a bit odd?

636
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,800
Sorry, I'm late.

637
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,040
Assemblyman.

638
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,780
Yes?

639
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,140
Why?

640
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,890
Whom am I secretly meeting?

641
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,460
Oh Sae Chang. The Korean
Democratic Party Chair.

642
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,040
Am I going to join
that party now?

643
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,910
Then I won't be Jin Sang Pil
but will become Jin Sang Bird.

644
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:51,090
When it comes to birds, let us raise
just one bird, Jo Woong Bird.

645
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,010
Oh Sae Chang is a
reasonable person.

646
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,800
If you explain all the
circumstances leading

647
00:45:56,812 --> 00:45:59,240
up to this and ask
for his cooperation,

648
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,443
there is a possibility that the
Korean Democratic Party also

649
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:01,610
will decide to vote autonomously
like the Anti-BH faction.

650
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,460
Autonomously?

651
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:09,530
If that happens, there's a good
chance the motion will be voted down.

652
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,570
Voted down?

653
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:15,690
You're saying it
can be defeated.

654
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,450
Yes. I'm going to
contact him right now.

655
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,420
I have a friend among Party
Chair Oh Sae Chang's aides.

656
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,200
Wait a moment, Aide Choi.

657
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,050
Yes?

658
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,140
I will just do it.

659
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,790
I will appear before
the prosecutor.

660
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,380
Assemblyman, are you
in your right mind?

661
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,850
My mind is clear, of course.

662
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,890
After agonizing over it all night,
that's the decision which emerged.

663
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,760
You understand that way.

664
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,530
I will go see Joo Hee and Joo
Hee's mom and come back.

665
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,640
Meanwhile, get ready for my appearance
at the prosecutor's office.

666
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,100
Why on earth are you doing this?
I'm saying that the

667
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:56,490
motion to allow you to be
arrested can be defeated.

668
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,680
Defeating it does not mean
I won't ever be arrested..

669
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,320
It's only until the end of the legislative
session that I have immunity.

670
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,740
Until then, somehow, conditions
favorable to you can be created.

671
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,940
Don't you know the regular session
will end when the first snow falls?

672
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,600
Until the first snowfall, you want me
to hear people saying "son-of-a-bi*ch"?

673
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,260
What?

674
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,950
I can't do that, seriously.
So... <br>-Assemblyman.

675
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:23,210
This time, please let's do what I decide.
Without "but"...

676
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,140
No!

677
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,897
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you know what'll

678
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:33,550
happen if you appear at the
prosecutor's office now?

679
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:38,910
The prosecutor already applied to
a judge for an arrest warrant.

680
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:42,470
The court still has to review
it and sign off on it.

681
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,280
But, as of now, chances of your
arrest warrant getting denied

682
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,080
are extremely slim.

683
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,820
See? You are to eat bean rice, bean
rice (EUPHEMISM FOR GOING TO JAIL)!

684
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,350
If that happens, then
it can't be helped.

685
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,620
What, you punk?

686
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,440
Secretary-nim.

687
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,990
Why are you like this, Hyung?

688
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,770
Then it can't be helped?

689
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:11,930
How can you say such a
thing to Ae Ri and me?

690
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,040
Are you saying we
should just watch

691
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,280
you wearing a prison uniform and
chowing down bean rice, punk?!

692
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:22,190
Assemblyman, for Kyung Ah and Joo Hee's
sakes, too, you shouldn't be doing this.

693
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,090
I have already made up my mind.

694
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:30,360
Just because you're doing
this, which citizen

695
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,670
would understand how you feel?

696
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,820
Only you will just
end up being a fool.

697
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,810
All the difficulties you've
gone through so far...

698
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:44,190
They were all for nothing and
it will be the end for you!

699
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,070
Why is that the end?
It is not the end.

700
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:48,910
What did you say?

701
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:54,260
The real end for me
is that I hide behind

702
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,600
that parliamentary immunity or whatever.
So the people

703
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:04,260
believing that this People's Spoilsport
Jing Sang Pil is a real son-of-a-bi*ch.

704
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,890
So they will believe that
the Indifferent-to-BH thing

705
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:11,420
we did was all just
putting on a show.

706
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:14,810
That would be the real end.

707
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:20,400
Let's just say that I somehow got arrested.
That I am all locked up.

708
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,880
Then, Aide Choi, and you, Hyung, and
Secretary Oh, and our secretaries...

709
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,970
will you just play around?
Of course not.

710
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,280
You will work even harder.
To get me out.

711
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,970
To prove my innocence.

712
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:44,810
So how can that be the end?
When I have you people.

713
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,720
Hey...

714
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,690
Aide Choi.

715
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,770
Yes?

716
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,510
You said you didn't
want to make me

717
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,540
into an assemblyman who shines just
for a moment and then disappears.

718
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,540
Yes.

719
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,880
Then let me go.

720
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,920
I'm sorry.

721
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,300
Assemblywoman, what brings
you into the office today?

722
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,790
I wanted to do something
before I resigned.

723
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,110
What's that?

724
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,990
The motion to arrest
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

725
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:37,950
Pro-BH and Anti-BH must be
playing pat-a-cake together.

726
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:41,330
At least I should vote
against it, as a neighbor.

727
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,330
How can you change your
position just before the vote?

728
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,010
You scared me.

729
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,770
Who's changing his position?

730
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:53,290
The arrest motion. I heard
you were going to vote yes.

731
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,380
So what do you mean,
an autonomous vote?

732
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,360
I never said such a thing.

733
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,160
And the autonomous vote,

734
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,420
isn't that a good thing?

735
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:08,800
Let's not tire ourselves out like this.
Please unify Anti-BH faction's votes.

736
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,720
Assemblyman Jo.

737
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,300
Democracy itself is exhausting.

738
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,740
Are you not going to do democracy
just because it's exhausting?!

739
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,260
Ha!

740
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,630
Where... Yes.

741
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,550
Voluntarily go to
the prosecutor?

742
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,710
Voluntarily go to
the prosecutor?

743
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,230
Who? Jin Sang Pil?

744
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,030
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil decides
voluntarily to go to the prosecutor.</i>

745
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:43,265
<i>Jin's side insists on his innocence and
emphasizes that he will be openly interrogated</i>

746
00:51:43,277 --> 00:51:47,090
<i>by the prosecutor regardless of the
Assembly's decision on his arrest motion...</i>

747
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:50,050
Voluntarily go to
the prosecutor.

748
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,020
What is this?

749
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,400
Please take good care of them.

750
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,120
I have great faith in you.
Please help Aide Choi out a lot.

751
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,440
Assemblyman, please don't
worry about this office.

752
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,060
Yes.

753
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,740
Secretary Sim, spend less time
drinking, singing, and dancing.

754
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,010
Yes, I will.

755
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,610
You've lost a lot of weight.

756
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:26,050
For Miss Song, I
have a special gift.

757
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:30,630
What is this?

758
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,770
Gyu Hwan's phone number.

759
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:37,550
Assemblyman, don't go.

760
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,050
Do well.

761
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,270
Da Jeong, do well too.

762
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:50,510
Don't be too disappointed with the
National Assembly. Understand?

763
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,490
Yes.

764
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,780
Secretary Oh, what's with you?

765
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,820
Huh?

766
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,420
That’s what I’m saying.

767
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,700
Why am I like this?

768
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,360
Why is everyone's mood
like this, really?

769
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,560
Is Assemblyman Jin going
somewhere to die?

770
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,700
Assemblyman Jin is obnoxious, so
even the jail won't accept him.

771
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,660
So he'll come back in one piece.

772
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,940
Isn't that so?

773
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,020
I don't think so.

774
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:29,110
Assemblywoman Hong.

775
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,870
From the looks of everyone's moods, you're
really voluntarily going to the prosecutor.

776
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:37,050
Yes, well, there's that.

777
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:41,550
Now that you're entering a
lion's den, who's your guard?

778
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,730
Is it So-and-So Choi who's the
star of the tabloid rumor?

779
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:50,010
We're a combo, you know.

780
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:55,090
What can an aide do with the
prosecutor outside the Assembly?

781
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:00,210
I'll introduce a
good lawyer to you.

782
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,970
Lawyer?

783
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,970
Who?

784
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,550
Me, Hong Chan Mi.

785
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:12,510
What?

786
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:25,200
Why are you suddenly
becoming my lawyer?

787
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,480
I can't give you any money.
I don't have any.

788
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,740
Gosh.

789
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:35,180
I got so frustrated watching you
two fools that I couldn't help it.

790
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,520
Fools?

791
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,640
The two of us?

792
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,360
Assemblyman Jin.

793
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,240
Now I am a discontinued item with
only a few months left of her term.

794
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:53,100
But if it's okay with you, Assemblyman, I
will work with you for my remaining months.

795
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,160
With me?

796
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,040
I will join the
Indifferent-to-BH faction.

797
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,480
Assemblywoman Hong.

798
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,640
Please take care of me.

799
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,800
Assemblywoman Hong.

800
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,360
But!

801
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,100
Choi In Kyung is barred
within my 2-meter radius.

802
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,600
Also prohibited from eating
together or seeing me alone.

803
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,970
No...

804
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,590
Aide Choi, what do I do now?
This is trouble.

805
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,630
I'll make one for you.

806
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,310
I'll make you a
really great wrap.

807
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,850
Kimchi, kimchi.

808
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,590
Garlic too.

809
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:48,590
And... I should put
the soybean paste.

810
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,070
Of course.

811
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,390
Looks delicious.<br>- I
don't do this for Mom.

812
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,790
Jealous, aren't you?

813
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,710
<i>Cheers!</i>

814
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,980
<i>Ah.</i>

815
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,880
<i>Ah, seriously.</i>

816
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,110
<i>Delicious!</i>

817
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:09,650
Delicious.

818
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,410
You get a glass.

819
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:16,090
Yeah?

820
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:20,190
You, too. Joo Hee. Have a drink.

821
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:25,010
It's really been a long time.

822
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,370
Cheers. Say something.

823
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:31,020
Our family will stay together forever!

824
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,030
Okay. Forever!

825
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,920
This is good. Why aren't you eating?
Have a sip.

826
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,400
<i>We trust Assemblyman Jin!</i>

827
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,900
<i>Cheer up, Assemblyman!</i>

828
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,010
He's coming!

829
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,700
He's here!

830
00:57:35,700 --> 00:58:07,340
<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

831
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:10,420
From this point on, don't answer
the reporters' questions.

832
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,350
Just a word about how you feel.

833
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:15,710
Okay.<br>- <i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

834
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:20,790
<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

835
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,410
Let's go.

836
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:32,330
<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

837
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,710
Okay.<br>- <i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

838
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,750
<i>Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!</i>

839
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,820
What made you decide to come voluntarily?

840
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,940
Tell us how you feel about
getting investigated.

841
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,860
Are you still denying all charges?

842
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,020
Yes. I'm innocent.

843
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,160
What made you make a voluntary appearance?

844
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,760
What do you mean, by innocence?

845
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,020
Are you prepared to be detained?

846
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,040
Tell us. <br>- Say something.

847
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,050
Assemblyman Jin, please tell us
what made you make an appearance.

848
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,110
Assemblyman!

849
