11
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,720
Your expression is so grim
from the first day at work.

12
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,840
-Hello.<br>-People would think
you're going into a battle.

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,860
Do you have an overreacting
personality to begin with?

14
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,600
You know I am a serious person.

15
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,060
I wasn't overreacting but
making a firm resolution.

16
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,530
That is overreacting.

17
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,720
Resolution is for a person
in a responsible position.

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,830
And alertness is
reserved for the staff.

19
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,590
Future overreacting is
prohibited, understand?

20
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,310
Yes.

21
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,440
Good morning, Aide Choi.

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,170
How refreshing...

23
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,810
Hello.

24
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,930
Get in, what are you doing?

25
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,510
Oh, you came all
spruced up today.

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,180
When did you come in?

27
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,170
Oh, you are here?

28
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,405
Since there are eyes in the
Assemblyman Center,<br>I think

29
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,040
it best to refrain from
sleeping in the office.

30
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,782
We have to save at
least the motel

31
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:04,150
fees.<br>There are so many
expenses to be paid.

32
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,750
Did you stay up all night?

33
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,540
Well, I think so, but

34
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,940
I don't know what I did at all.

35
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,670
It's not something you
can learn by cramming.

36

<i>Society. Culture</i>

37
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,010
-Take it easy.<br>-Then,
I'm a thief.

38
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,830
What?

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,648
Are the people paying
me to study?<br>They're

40
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,060
paying me to hurry
up and do something.

41
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,950
That should be right.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,650
Continue, then, your cramming.

43
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,270
What is she saying?

44
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,240
Eh, also, a secretary
does not have a mouth.

45
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,980
And what does this mean?

46
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,600
In the future, both of you

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,230
cannot go outside and
spout without permission

48
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,180
what you've seen and
heard in the office, OK?

49
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,430
-Yes.<br>-Yes.

50
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,470
This is not some National
Intelligence Service...

51
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,390
He means watch your tongues.

52
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,821
There weren't just one or
two assemblymen who had

53
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,190
suffered because of their
tongue-wagging staff.

54
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,010
There were even assemblymen who
had lost their heads (SEATS).

55
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,680
Politicians are people who walk
the fine line of the prison wall.

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,720
Keep in mind that the aide
staff, on that dangerous path,

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,040
are guides who lead the
assemblyman to the right path.

58
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,860
Yes.

59
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,950
Gyu Hwan, why aren't
you answering?

60
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,450
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

61
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,640
Okay, then start the day.

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,590
I will work hard.

63
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,540
Mr. Kim Gyu Hwan... seems
like a bit gloomy person.

64
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,780
<i>Father, watch me...</i>

65
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,840
Mr. Kim Gyu Hwan, let's work
well together in the future.

66
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,470
Let's work hard.

67
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,930
I am totally disappointed
in you, CEO.

68
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,920
-Why?<br>-Didn't you say you would put
on the (ASSEMBLY) badge later?

69
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,590
You said politicians survive
not on food but on pride.

70
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,520
And you become Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil's aide?

71
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,250
Someone slid into the
nomination because of you!

72
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,670
Don't nag me but just answer.<br>Are you
going to come to our office or not?

73
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,050
Our office?<br>Are you
nice or spineless?

74
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,130
Don't rub it in and just
give me a quick answer.

75
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,970
Why will I go there? Under an assemblyman
who is not even like an assemblyman,

76
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,650
it's clear that I will just work like a
dog and after a year become unemployed.

77
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,120
Hey, Song So Min!

78
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
Aide!

79
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,720
Oh, what brings you here?

80
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,480
Aide Seo asked us to buy
some office supplies.

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,600
Gyu Hwan, hello.

82
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,740
Yes, how are you?

83
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,400
But are you working for
the National Assembly?

84
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,950
Yes, I have ended up working in
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's office.

85
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh, by the way, Aide Choi. Thank you for
that compilation of interview questions.

86
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,690
What do you mean a compilation?

87
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,430
You know what So Min
gave me before.

88
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,910
She said you ordered
her to do it.

89
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,770
Oh, why bring up what's past.<br>You
have such a meticulous personality.

90
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,560
Go on and continue
with your business.

91
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,420
Aren't you going to work? Go!

92
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,870
Such undisciplined newbies...

93
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,520
Did you use me to hit on him?

94
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,340
I have a personal
taste too, you know!

95
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,703
I was just considerate toward
him because it's commendable

96
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:26,290
that a young person tries
so hard to make it.

97
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,950
-Recite it.<br>-What?

98
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,642
You told me to
take charge of the

99
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:33,210
promotion.<br>Recite a list
of the papers you need.

100
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,130
Oh really...

101
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,730
Go in please.

102
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,030
<i>Gookmin Party General Meeting
for Emergency Policies</i>

103
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,630
What did you say this now is?

104
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,500
That is, it is a Gookmin Party's general
meeting to discuss emergency policies.

105
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,080
So, exactly, what is this about?

106
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,480
Oh, that is, as I was saying...

107
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,840
It's a neighborhood meeting...

108
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,360
amongst assemblymen.

109
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,340
This is the first time we're meeting
each other face to face, right?

110
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,300
Oh, yes, I am Jin Sang Pil.

111
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,980
I'm Park Choon Seob.

112
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,910
Let's eat together some time.

113
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,140
Ah, yes, a meal.

114
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,160
How is our economy right now?

115
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,503
The citizens have
closed their wallets<br>and

116
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,460
businesses are not
making investments.

117
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,170
Then, shouldn't at least the government
pump in money and stimulate the economy?

118
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,220
We have to come up with an
immediate modified budget

119
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,910
and increase
government spending!

120
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,420
Here! Here!

121
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,550
The government came up with a
modified budget a long time ago.

122
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,100
So why hasn't it submitted it
to the National Assembly yet?

123
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,230
Is it because they are afraid
of the opposition parties?

124
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,090
It's because they are scared
of the Anti-BH faction.

125
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,459
When it comes to stimulating
the economy, where

126
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,780
are the differences between
the Pro- and Anti-BH?

127
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,450
This assemblyman will give
firm support this time.

128
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,990
So, the government better submit the
modified budget to the Assembly right now!

129
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,270
That is all.

130
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,460
He is making a display to get some of
the budget money for his constituency.

131
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,050
Hello.

132
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,040
Secretary General, look where
Assemblyman Jin sat down.

133
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,860
It's nice to see.

134
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,920
Now, if there is no other
assemblyman who wants to speak,

135
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,120
I am about to
dismiss everyone...

136
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
Just a minute, moderator.

137
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes, Assemblyman Park.

138
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,700
Isn't this Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's first general meeting?

139
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,780
Let's welcome him and
hear his greeting words.

140
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,000
It's okay with me
if I don't speak.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,080
Oh, I didn't think about that.

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,920
Assemblyman Jin!

143
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,780
Ah, yes... Please come out.

144
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,340
I didn't need to speak up.

145
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,140
Then...

146
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,580
Is aiding him bearable?

147
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,740
The rumor is that he is
such a trouble maker.

148
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,120
He's a good person.<br>The problem
is that he is incompetent.

149
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,200
Hello, I am Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil.

150
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,960
-Assemblyman Jin?<br>-Yes?

151
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,800
Since the session will start
soon, please hurry up.

152
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,320
Oh, yes...

153
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,580
But what do I say now?

154
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,529
Oh, well, things like your
resolve or determination

155
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,640
regarding participation in
the legislative activities.

156
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,200
Just a brief comment would do.

157
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,580
Oh, determination... briefly...

158
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,420
Yes, to the best
of my abilities,

159
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,960
fight!!

If a similar occasion arises again in
the future,<br>you can say it like this.

163
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,400
I will put the party before all
personal interests and work hard.

164
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,303
I beg a lot of guidance
and instructions<br>from

166
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,640
Yes, that party

about at the general meeting...

168
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,740
Modified budget?

169
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,160
What is that exactly?

170
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Pursuant to the National Financing
Act, in the event a war, natural

171
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:14,140
disaster or great depression occurs
or is in danger of occurring...

172
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,033
in order to respond, the
government, in addition

173
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,600
to the already approved
national budget,

174
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,900
sets a modified budget.

175
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,000
Wow, you're a computer.

176
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,840
Wow, then, that modified budget,

177
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,720
that thing is a very
good thing, right?

178
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
There are many adverse
effects as well.

179
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,860
Especially at times of serious
tax revenue decrease like now,

180
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,060
a fiscal deficit through issuance
of government bonds is unavoidable.

181
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,240
This leads to an increase in the national
debt<br>and worsens the financial health.

182
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,680
Yes, so, this has
nothing to do with me.

183
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,260
Depending on which standing
committee you're assigned to,

184
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,720
it may have something
to do with you.

185
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,880
Oh, I've heard that word
earlier, standing committee...

186
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,700
Which one?

187
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,700
Strategy and something...

188
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,160
Oh, Strategy and
Finance Committee!

189
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,780
SFC?

190
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,640
But that is a major league...
What?

191
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
We'd like Assemblyman Jin's
standing committee to be changed.

192
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,040
Sunbae-nim, please put in a
good word to the floor leader.

193
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,533
Why? It's a major
standing committee<br>that

194
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:22,660
everyone else is just
antsy to get in.

195
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,760
The SFC is too much
for Assemblyman Jin.

196
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,680
How come?

197
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,946
It's a committee where they deal
with the national budget of

198
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,460
trillions, all sorts of pension
funds, taxes and monetary policies.

199
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,680
Even economic experts
have hard times.

200
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,980
Do you think Assemblyman
Jin can even understand?

201
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,860
Probably... that's why
they sent him to the SFC.

202
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,120
What?

203
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,920
If he doesn't understand, then he
has no choice but to stay quiet.

204
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,020
Then he won't get
himself into trouble.

205
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,040
Just accept it.

206
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,820
For Assemblyman Jin, too,
that must be the best thing.

207
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,280
How about the best thing for me?

208
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,640
What should I do with an assemblyman
whose lips are glued together.

209
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,900
Must you... do something?

210
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,840
What?

211
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,440
No one in Yeouido expects Assemblyman
Jin to accomplish anything.

212
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,960
As I have told you
here, In Kyung, you

213
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,340
just have to help Assemblyman Jin
to smoothly adapt to the Assembly.

214
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,800
After massively messing up the
national economy for the first half,

215
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,410
are you saying Deputy
Prime Minister and

216
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:37,320
Minister of the Ministry
of Strategy and Finance

217
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,180
won't utter a word of
apology to the people?

218
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,900
Because, as I have repeatedly
told you, I cannot agree to

219
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,180
- your expression of messing up...<br>-
Look here, Deputy Prime Minister!!

220
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,740
Don't you even look at the
basic economic indices?

221
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,420
Everything is 0%.

222
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,740
They are somewhat lacking but...

223
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,380
You didn't mess up, but
just a bit lacking?

224
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,180
What I am saying is...

225
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,920
there is a need to look
at the overall picture.

226
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,100
What are you going to do about the second
half?<br>Things are not looking up, right?

227
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,280
The government is devising measures
to stimulate the economy, but...

228
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,880
in the face of continuing
difficulties, we...

229
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,200
<i>The speaker asks
you not to doze.</i>

230
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,080
are very much concerned.

231
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,820
What use is being concerned,
you should be working!

232
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,480
I sympathize with
what you're saying...

233
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,360
You just spoke of a broad policy
strengthening the finances.

234
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,380
You will set a modified
budget, right?

235
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,300
Yes, including an
additional budget,

236
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,920
we are in the middle of
considering various measures.

237
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,260
Don't set a modified budget.

238
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,120
Just from the first half,
there was a massive amount of

239
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,080
shortage in tax revenues.

240
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,640
When the state
coffers are empty,

241
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,955
this kind of suggestion
to create a debt<br>to

242
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,700
increase spending
is irresponsible.

243
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,600
Come out.

244
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,760
In my judgment,

245
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,880
- What did you say? <br>
- Please go out.

246
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,840
-Come out.<br>-... the dangerous
threshold has been long crossed.

247
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,180
Here.

248
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,080
Oh, thank you.

249
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,300
I guess you left things like know-hows and
flexibility back in your constituency.

250
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,280
What?

251
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,089
If you're so sleepy, why
don't you take some

252
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,720
time outside rather
than sitting it out?

253
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,540
You know the people dislike the
politicians<br>leaving their seats empty.

254
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,820
The room was almost
empty as it was.

255
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,740
And there are people who
like dozing (ON THE JOB)?

256
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,028
I could understand the
political questions a little

257
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,560
bit, but when the economic
issues were brought up,

258
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,040
it was like a foreign
language to me.

259
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,780
How are you going to participate
in the SFC like that?

260
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,820
Ah, that's what I'm saying.
I'm in big trouble.

261
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,160
-Assemblyman Jin.<br>-Yes?

262
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,200
I know a very good policy aide.

263
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,180
Shall I recommend you to him?

264
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,460
Oh, really?

265
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,920
You're telling me to move to
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's Office?

266
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,320
Since Assemblyman Jin
okayed it, please do so.

267
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,660
I do have... reasons.

268
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,980
Right, I know you've
worked hard all this time,

269
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,400
but connections from the assembly
are not lifelong anyway.

270
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,820
Go to Assemblyman Jin
and assist him well.

271
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,140
Assemblywoman...

272
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,060
Why are you like this,
making me feel sorry?

273
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,120
Am I kicking you out to
the streets just now?

274
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,220
It's just that I'm thankful.

275
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,720
Thank you, Assemblywoman.

276
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,320
Wow, really, thank you!
Thank you.

277
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
Aide Seo, just a moment!

278
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,400
Have you, by any chance, heard
about me moving into there?

279
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,200
Oh, I just heard
from the old man.

280
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,820
Wow, a jackpot event!

281
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,100
Oh, I thought Madame
Hong had lied again.

282
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,220
Oh, Dear Lord, I thank thee!
Hallelujah!

283
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,400
Oh, Lord!

284
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,360
I'm going to remove
my stuff right away.

285
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,860
Oh, hey, punk! Stay put!

286
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,520
The atmosphere is not
like that right now.

287
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,200
Why not?

288
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,980
Secretary Shim Dong Cheon
is not acceptable.

289
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,840
Why not?

290
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,240
He has no experience with the SFC
and<br>his work ethics are problematic.

291
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,420
But he has an impressive resume and also,
supposedly, outstanding abilities.

292
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,860
Assemblywoman Hong would not give
up help with outstanding abilities.

293
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,654
I don't know, the bus
has left already.<br>I've

294
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,020
already promised
Assemblywoman Hong.

295
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,900
Buy her a meal and cancel it.

296
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,300
So frustrating really...
As an assemblyman,

297
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,040
how can I break a promise
that I've already made?

298
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,360
It's not a promise but you've
been taken for a ride!

299
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,980
-Well, let's just
go with it.<br>-No way!

300
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,580
Ah, you're really
being too much!

301
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,620
No matter who comes, he
will be better than me.

302
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,160
That's why we cannot
use just anybody.

303
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,800
Would I do this with
another assemblyman?

304
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,760
Well, that is the truth. You must
be acting like this<br>because it's me.

305
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,270
I am sorry. It was a
slip of the tongue.

306
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,360
Aigoo, no, that's okay.
What verbal mistake...

307
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,330
Assemblyman!

308
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,600
Secretary Sim... what is your
reason for rejecting him?

309
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,950
Because he is not a suitable secretary
advising on the SFC policies.

310
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,890
He is going to ignore the courtesy
of a colleague like that?

311
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,930
I know that you are going to run from
your hometown district next year.

312
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,550
And that you intend to
let secretary Sim go

313
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,200
to replace him with a person
to work on that district.

314
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,790
So, an aide is commenting about
what the Assemblymen decided?

315
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,590
You are very
impertinent, aren't you?

316
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,630
-Assemblywoman Hong. <br>-Do I
still look like the person

317
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:20,270
who was under you in the
Presidential election

318
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,400
running around campaigning?

319
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,520
You should talk only
about Secretary Sim.

320
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,400
He is not my secretary anymore.

321
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,560
Whether Assemblyman Jin takes
him or not, let him decide.

322
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,230
With all due respect,
may I say something?

323
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,330
As much as you want.

324
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,760
If you are a lawmaker,
please act like one.

325
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,800
That's similar to what I
wanted to say to you.

326
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,500
If you are an aide,
then act like an aide.

327
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,438
Don't take an assemblyman who knows nothing
and play Princess Pyonggang (famous

328
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,400
historic figure who turned her "idiotic"
husband into a great general) with him.

329
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,780
Leave.

330
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,900
<i>Asssemblywoman Hong Chan Mi</i>

331
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,890
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil</i>

332
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,350
Let's take in Dong Cheun. He's been
intimidated by Hong Chan Mi so much but

333
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,960
originally, he was a
smart working fellow.

334
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,230
He also likes to be treated
by government agencies.

335
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,812
Without that kind of fun,
what would we, ephemeral

336
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:38,520
workers, live for? Even if
it's only to save my face,

337
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,614
please bend your stubbornness.
At that rate, that kid

338
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,850
will end up like a forlorn
duck egg by the Nakdong River.

339
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,330
Tell him to move his belongings.

340
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,010
Oh, thank you.

341
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,760
Oh right...

342
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,560
I am saying this for your sake.

343
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,010
With your skills, I don't know
how long you'll stay here but

344
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,850
while you are here,
don't overdo things.

345
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,530
What are you saying?

346
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:11,710
About our old man, no matter
how hard we aides try,

347
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,530
there are assemblymen who
simply cannot make it.

348
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,500
Aide Seo.

349
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,740
Don't make people around you pointlessly
suffer as well, but roughly

350
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,350
just kill time and leave.

351
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,080
I'm Sim Dong Cheon.

352
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm Kim Gyu Hwan. Let's
work well together.

353
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,830
I can speak informally right?

354
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,790
Oh, yes of course.

355
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,830
I wasn't like that when
I was an intern but...

356
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,400
Excuse me?

357
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,960
Over there.

358
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,490
Oh yes.

359
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:10,620
That's it.

360
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,080
Ms. Park Da Jeong?

361
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,900
Yes?

362
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,220
One cup of green tea. Iced.

363
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,520
Yes.

364
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,840
Thank you.

365
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,280
Oh, Sunbae. My place is there.

366
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:47,540
<i>Must you... do something? There is
no one who expects Assemblyman Jin</i>

367
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,010
<i>to accomplish anything
here in Yeouido.</i>

368
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,490
<i>If you become an Assemblyman
who is applauded by people,</i>

369
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,570
<i>then, I'll come down.</i>

370
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,800
Yes, what is it?

371
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:19,010
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki</i>

372
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,380
What's this?<br><i>2015
Supplementary Budget Bill</i>

373
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,740
Assemblyman, hello.

374
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,400
Who are you?

375
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,970
I am a senior vice minister of the Ministry
of Strategy and Finance, Oh Yeong Ha.

376
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,950
Oh...

377
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,360
-I am the budget department head.<br>-I
am the tax department head.

378
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,970
Oh, yes.

379
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,799
The government has
submitted a supplementary

380
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,810
budget bill to the
National Assembly.

381
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,774
<i>Regarding the supplementary
budget bill of about $15 billion</i>

382
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:00,940
<i>that the government has
submitted, the National Assembly</i>

383
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,190
<i>plans to convene the appropriate standing
committee and start a review next week.</i>

384
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,360
<i>However, the opposition parties including
the Korea Democratic Party are opposing</i>

385
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,240
<i>it as a pork barrel bill created with
an eye to next year's general election.</i>

386
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,430
<i>It will face substantial obstacles
before passage. Next on the news...</i>

387
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,222
<i>Even this year, if we
don't reach the economic</i>

388
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:21,620
<i>growth that we promised
in the election,</i>

389
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,000
<i>the public sentiment will
totally turn against us.</i>

390
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,940
<i>We can't let that happen.</i>

391
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,260
<i>I'll relay the VIP's
instructions.</i>

392
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,660
<i>In regards to the
supplementary budget,</i>

393
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,010
<i>no matter what, he says to make
it pass by end of this month.</i>

394
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,080
What do I owe this honor
to, Assemblyman Park?

395
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,840
<i>I thought I wanted to have
a cup of tea with you.</i>

396
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,190
<i>Can you make time?</i>

397
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,486
This time, too, the review
of the supplemetary

398
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:10,350
budget bill will
not go smoothly.

399
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,420
The opposition parties
are expected to home in

400
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:16,400
and latch on to the issue
of government bonds.

401
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,983
Isn't that their favorite card
to play in every review of

402
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,500
a supplementary budget bill?
Government bonds are debts.

403
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,130
The national debt
should not increase.

404
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,496
At any rate, government bond
issuance is the business

405
00:27:26,508 --> 00:27:28,930
of the SFC (STRATEGY &AMP;
FINANCE STANDING COMMITTEE).

406
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,920
Our Assemblyman Kang Sang Ho, who is the
head of the SFC, will have many headaches.

407
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,885
Assemblyman Kang's words at the
general executive meeting,

408
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:38,470
to support it irrespective
of different factions...

409
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,670
I am very appreciative of them.

410
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,860
Give and take...

411
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,980
Politics is not about
paying empty lip service.

412
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,538
There is some money within
the supplementary budget

413
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,540
earmarked for SOC (SOCIAL
OVERHEAD CAPITAL) works.

414
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,069
I will talk to the Budget
Committee chairman and,

415
00:27:59,081 --> 00:28:01,470
for your and Assemblyman
Kang's constituencies,

416
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,740
pay extra attention.

417
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,733
Look here, Secretary General Baek.
I am not called

418
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:13,790
the acting head of the
Anti-BH faction for nothing.

419
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,997
You cannot, by any chance,
mean to look after all

420
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:19,970
the assemblymen in the
Anti-BH faction, right?

421
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,820
Please pay more attention to the
(ANTI-BH) assemblymen from...

422
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,480
less developed areas and constituencies
with strong pro-opposition tendencies.

423
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,820
To care for all those people,
the budget has to be enlarged.

424
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,910
It should be enlarged,
if necessary.

425
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,036
Being in politics,
I've seen the budget

426
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:40,400
stretched like a rubber
band numerous times.

427
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,470
- Assemblyman Park!<br>- We,
the Anti-BH faction...

428
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,148
Aren't we the people pushed
to the bottom rung of the

429
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,700
party for having gotten
behind the wrong candidate?

430
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,470
Please let us at least
get a little money to

431
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,490
go back and be praised
by our constituents.

432
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,310
An increase is difficult. The extra budget
does not come from already collected taxes.

433
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,380
Isn't the country
incurring new debt?

434
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,620
Debts or whatever...

435
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,760
in the end, that money goes round and round
and ends up in the citizens' pockets.

436
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,240
Since we are doing it,
let's do it boldly.

437
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,360
So we can help you boldly too.

438
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:25,240
<i>He says to pass the supplementary budget
by end of this month no matter what.</i>

439
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,300
If you have an excellent
idea, I want to hear it.

440
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,390
Tell a pro-BH assemblyman
sitting on the SFC

441
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,000
to call for an increase
in the budget.

442
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,900
If he just sends the signal, Assemblyman
Kang Sang Ho will take care of the rest.

443
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,780
At a time of close scrutiny from
the opposition parties and media,

444
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:55,700
would there be an assemblyman with such
steely nerves to make that kind of call?

445
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,660
People with nerves of steel
are not the only brave ones.

446
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,711
Because of a change in the plan
to sell bonds we're in a bit of a

447
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:08,760
difficult position to secure the
budget size we had planned originally.

448
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,400
If you look at this diagram, the
2014 budget and 2015 one...

449
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,980
are shown like this. Please
look over this closely...

450
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,440
and if you also look at...

451
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,560
The ignorant also
tend to be brave.

452
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,780
Bottom line, this is very
popular, here too.<br>Expenditure...

453
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm going to get
cramps in my brain.

454
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,080
Hey!

455
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,120
Where did everyone go?

456
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,000
Send an information request first
to the SFC and its organizations.

457
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,240
They are really bad about
giving information...

458
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,126
-Kim Gyu Hwan, support
policy and when Secretary

459
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:40,200
Byeon is not available,
escort the Assemblyman.<br>-OK.

460
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,800
I told you to print out the materials
before the meeting.<br>Where are they?

461
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,840
Let's get a move on.

462
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,460
Here, this is...

463
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,020
What does this mean?

464
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,280
Have you seen the vice minister
going home totally drained?

465
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,420
Of course he'd be drained.

466
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,940
He had to lecture to a person who does
not even understand for over an hour.

467
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,280
Was that a lecture and not
chanting a mantra to a cow's ears?

468
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,640
For a man like him... what does he
mean by playing an assemblyman...

469
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,500
This is why the
Assembly gets reviled.

470
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,360
Hey Jin Sang Pil,

471
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,540
You, don't be a scaredy-cat, huh?
Understand?

472
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,960
I said don't be scared, punk!
Why are you scared?

473
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,200
I called you just in case that
something might be said of this.

474
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,560
Did the Assemblyman
cause any trouble?

475
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,280
It's not that.

476
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,800
It's just that over there.

477
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,380
I see that the voltage was too high.
You're an an amateur at welding, right?

478
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,020
Well I...

479
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,580
Next time when you
do this, call me.

480
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,420
I'll give you my phone number.

481
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,280
Okay, Assemblyman.

482
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,940
Why don't you take him now?

483
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,600
No, just let him be.

484
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,980
I'm sorry for being late.
I am Song So Min...

485
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
It's as cheap as it gets...

486
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,740
Office manager, are
you kidding me?

487
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,800
When did I ask for the information
for you to be still getting it?

488
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,240
I think this is the
perfect place to hang it.

489
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,140
What event was that?

490
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,600
-You call this congratulatory
message?<br>-I'll rewrite it.

491
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,820
<i>Can it be done?</i>

492
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,660
<i>Hello?</i>

493
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,820
Who do you think you are?

494
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,920
What time do you think it is?!

495
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,940
I'm sorry. There
was a traffic jam.

496
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,560
From the first day...

497
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,240
Why is this so difficult? About
the world surplus money...

498
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,000
Hello, Assemblyman! I'm a 6th-grade
secretary, Song So Min...

499
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,720
This world surplus money...
where did you say it is used?

500
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,880
Just a moment... Yes, then...

501
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,560
This is perfect. Can
I nail it here?

502
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,800
If I raise it any higher,
it'll be hard to nail...

503
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,440
Secretary Song will open
your blog and SNS accounts.

504
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,620
Now, I think you
would need this...

505
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:41,040
Wow, you shouldn't have...<br>Your
circumstances are not that great...

506
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,340
Ah, you must have done this because of
that slip of the tongue you made at me.

507
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,220
I purchased it with the
office expense money.

508
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,871
When my phone is perfectly
fine, why would you

509
00:35:53,883 --> 00:35:55,540
use the office money to
buy something like this?

510
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,920
Hello? Hello?

511
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,820
<i>Chief Secretary Lim Gyu Tae is here from
the Party Secretary General's Office.</i>

512
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,700
This is an important favor the
Secretary General is asking for.

513
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,860
What is this?

514
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,623
It's a bill to expand
the government bond

515
00:36:22,635 --> 00:36:25,500
issue to fund an increase
in the SOC budget.

516
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,304
<i>Social Overhead Capital -
money to support indirexctly</i>

517
00:36:27,316 --> 00:36:28,680
<i>industry through roads,
ports, power, etc.</i>

518
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,460
<i>and to support health,
education, research and culture</i>

519
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,960
Chief Secretary Lim, are you...

520
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,200
asking Assemblyman Jin
to make this proposal?

521
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,560
To boost the economy, we have to expand SOC
projects which maximize short term effects.

522
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,740
This will be a big help to create jobs
and to increase the national income.

523
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,620
Ah, the people's income...

524
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,740
Chief Secretary, just a moment.

525
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,320
- What?<br>- That proposal
is too dangerous.

526
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,674
If things go wrong,
Assemblyman Jin will be

527
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:05,160
bombarded by the opposition
parties and media.

528
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,700
Just pretend ignorance. The Anti-BH faction
demanded this from the Secretary General.

529
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,160
Are you calling the Secretary
General right now?

530
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,940
- What are you doing?<br>- I should ask
you what you are doing, Aide Choi.

531
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,860
Aide Choi, weren't you on
Secretary General's side?

532
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,200
Why are you playing the part
of Jin Sang Pil's right arm?

533
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,600
What? Look here,
Chief Secretary Lim!

534
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,780
Do me a favor and be loyal
just to one person.

535
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,300
Million, billion, trillion, quadrillion...
It's quadrillions we're talking about...

536
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,460
<i>The Importance of SOC (SOCIAL
OVERHEAD CAPITAL) projects</i>

537
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,060
Come in.

538
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,400
Assemblyman, I have finished
drafting the questionnaire.

539
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,940
Oh really? Thank you.

540
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,300
I prepared it using all my care and 19
years' experience as an assembly officer.

541
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,160
I don't know if
you will like it.

542
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,678
Oh~<br><i>(Questionnaire re:
Supplementary Budget</i>

543
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,960
<i>Bill (MINISTRY OF
STRATEGY AND FINANCE)</i>

544
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,740
It's easy to understand.<br><i>Cut SOC
Funds to Establish Balanced Budget</i>

545
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,980
Very good work.

546
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:32,300
Wow, it just stands out...<br>Is
it because of my mood?

547
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,280
Aigoo, Aide-nim...

548
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,540
- You said you were Officer
Park, right?<br>- Yes, Aide-nim.

549
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,440
Here you go, the questionnaire.

550
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,520
Aigoo, thank you, Aide-nim.

551
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,460
Well then.

552
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,340
Goodbye.

553
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,460
Hey,

554
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,060
is it okay if I go to
Gyeongjae City for a bit?

555
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,540
Why, did something happen?

556
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,100
Ae Ri closed her coffee shop.

557
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,463
- Why?<br>- What do you
mean why?<br>It went

558
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:21,420
belly up because
of slow business.

559
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,620
She's not answering my calls, so
I want to go see her personally.

560
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,100
While I'm there, I will go see if our
local office is running properly as well.

561
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,460
Okay.

562
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,340
What's that?

563
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,340
It's a questionnaire
Aide Seo prepared for me

564
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,520
Questionnaire?

565
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,960
Why?

566
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,228
Well, earlier, Aide Seo
was secretly passing

567
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,760
something to a
ministry official...

568
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,080
He called it a
questionnaire as well.

569
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,100
Pass what?

570
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,730
What's up with this mood?

571
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,670
Customary practice!
What does that mean?

572
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,200
Assemblyman, I am
telling you the truth.

573
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,450
But that means the Minister already knows
what I'm going to ask him at the meeting.

574
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,850
How can that bullsh*tty thing
be customary practice!

575
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,000
It is customary, Assemblyman.

576
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,230
- What?<br>- Strictly speaking,

577
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,950
it is a custom tacitly practiced between
government agencies and legislative aides.

578
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,480
Then, are you saying Aide
Seo did the right thing?

579
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,220
It is definitely not
a right thing, but

580
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:50,430
I am telling you that Aide Seo
did not do it for some kickback.

581
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:57,610
Assemblyman, I only hoped that
your proposal would go smoothly...

582
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,120
Why! Because you thought I would not
be able to even read this properly?

583
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,090
- No!<br>- Did I make
you that nervous?

584
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,940
Huh? Do I seem so laughable?

585
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,430
I feel ashamed, Assemblyman.

586
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,910
Assemblyman... You can go.

587
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:32,270
We are sorry. We will make sure
that this never happens again.

588
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,700
I have something to ask
you too, Aide Choi.

589
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,260
Go ahead.

590
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,760
Do you know what
Aide Seo wrote here?

591
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,710
In order to secure financial
health or something,

592
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,720
he says the size of the extra
budget has to be reduced.

593
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,860
But

594
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,570
The proposal Secretary General
Baek sent for me to read...

595
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,260
It's the exact opposite.

596
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,660
No matter how dumb I am,
I've seen and heard things.

597
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:11,530
Secretary General Baek's, this
one, is problematical, right?

598
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,310
It's just that they are perceiving
the situation differently.

599
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,740
You cannot say that it is...
problematical.

600
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,170
Neither has a problem?

601
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,340
- That is right.<br>- Then,
which one should I read?

602
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,440
Aide Seo's or Secretary
General Baek's?

603
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,660
I'm asking you which one!

604
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,870
I will read the one you tell me to.
Because I trust you.

605
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,330
Tell me frankly. Which
one shall it be?

606
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,900
If I were you...

607
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,630
I would read Secretary
General Baek's.

608
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,190
You mean it?

609
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,170
Yes.

610
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,570
I will be outside.

611
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:36,700
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

612
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,370
I am sorry.

613
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,510
I should have consulted
with you first.

614
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,980
Assemblyman...

615
00:43:56,110 --> 00:44:00,960
I am going to use this tomorrow,
so please send it to the SFC.

616
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,930
Everyone, go home.

617
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,960
Kim Gyu Hwan, aren't you going
to escort him?<br>Get ready quickly.

618
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,980
Oh, yes, okay.

619
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,080
Just a minute.

620
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,690
<i>Proposal to Boost Economy through Increase
of Government Subsidies for SOC Projects</i>

621

<i>(SUGGESTING INCREASE IN

622
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,170
But who wrote this proposal?

623
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,840
What are you doing?

624
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,910
I will escort you during
Secretary Byeon's absence.

625
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,470
Didn't you come to the Assembly to
learn rather than to drive? It's okay.

626
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,380
Why are you like this again?<br>Are you
going to do some martial arts again?

627
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,280
I will drive.

628
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,821
- Please allow me.<br>- Why do
you work so aggressively?

629
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:14,470
When you are going
to get fired anyway.

630
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,330
Do it, then.

631
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,420
Ms. Choi In Kyung told me you passed all
the way to the police job interview.

632
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,350
Yes.

633
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,670
So, why? Why didn't you
hang in there to the end?

634
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,010
I have something that I
want to do in the Assembly.

635
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,400
What thing do you want to do?

636
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,340
- What, be an
assemblyman?<br>- No.

637
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,300
I want to be the chief of staff
trusted by an assemblyman.

638
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,900
Then, are you going to keep
living separately from Sang Pil?

639
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,930
Since he became an assemblyman,

640
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,680
somehow he feels like a different person
and my heart goes out to him even less.

641
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,010
Your husband even made it big.
Just live with him!

642
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,510
What fallback do you have
to play so hard to get?

643
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:34,070
- My beauty?<br>- What
is this girl saying?

644
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,526
- Unni, you know once I was
the hottest babe in the

645
00:46:36,538 --> 00:46:39,100
KSR Accounting Department.<br>-
That's right, I guess?

646
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,000
By the way, what are you
going to do in the future?

647
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,750
I don't know...

648
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,490
All my savings are gone.

649
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:57,180
How is working in a restaurant?
Is it doable?

650
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,500
I'm bearing it and
working for Joo Hee, but

651
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,740
- I think it will be hard for someone
with your temperament.<br>- I know, right?

652
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,840
Why did I retire early? I
should have been brazen faced

653
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,720
and sat out my career
flicking abacus beads.

654
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:17,050
I'm saying this sincerely.

655
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,360
Unni,

656
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,460
what do you think about getting
it on with Oppa Seong Gi?

657
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,307
- What the hell are you
saying right now?<br>-

658
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,020
All his kids are grown
up and on their own.

659
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:28,920
And Oppa Seong Gi was such a loving
husband<br>while his wife was alive.

660
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,440
I should just...! Do
you want to die?!

661
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,380
- If you don't want to, don't.
Why shout?<br>- This wench...

662
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,180
Go and get some rest. I will be
there as soon as I'm done here.

663
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:44,090
- Okay.<br>- Be safe
on your way.

664
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,590
Department head Oh!

665
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,700
Sang Pil...

666
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,510
You're asking me to
be your secretary?

667
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,890
It is not just a secretary, but
an administrative secretary...

668
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:08,610
It's a job that manages
schedules and political funds.

669
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:12,180
My aide tells me that I should
use a trustworthy person.

670
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,480
Are you giving me alms because
I've become a beggar?

671
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,790
What do you mean alms giving?

672
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,620
I am asking you for a favor.

673
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,710
You even worked as the head of
KSR's accounting department.

674
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,960
Sang Pil,

675
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,880
I guess you took me
for a mighty lowlife.

676
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,920
But I, even if I
starve to death,

677
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,869
can't be a secretary to
a person who put on the

678
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:34,720
badge after stabbing his
friends in the back.

679
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,600
Department Head Oh...

680
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,410
Please help me.

681
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,260
I will do good.

682
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,250
How will you do good?

683
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,880
Do you have education
or are you rich?

684
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,610
At the most...

685
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,240
you'll be a lackey to
the high and mighty.

686
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,510
- Department Head Oh, I...<br>-
Stop building an air castle

687
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,610
and mind your own family.

688
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:07,560
What politics when you can't even
cover your own ass.<br>Forget it.

689
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:12,470
Department Head Oh...
Department Head Oh!

690
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,070
<i>Aide Choi, weren't you on
Secretary General's side?</i>

691
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,970
<i>Why are you playing the part
of Jin Sang Pil's right hand?</i>

692
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,370
<i>Be loyal to just one person.</i>

693
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,860
<i>Which one should I read?</i>

694
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:38,180
<i>I will read the one you tell me to.
Because I trust you.</i>

695
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,020
Why is this open?

696
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,810
Didn't you go home yet?

697
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,340
The questionnaire that General
Secretary Baek sent...

698
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,320
Are you really going to
interrogate tomorrow?

699
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,070
I told you I would do.

700
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,530
- Why?<br> - Pardon?

701
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,650
That you will get into
trouble If you interrogate,

702
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,860
have you already guessed.

703
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,620
Whether I get into
trouble or not,

704
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,100
when you told me to do,

705
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,420
there must be a
reasonable reason.

706
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,430
Of course, there is a reason.

707
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:44,500
I am close to General
Secretary Baek.

708
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,380
That's why, no matter what,

709
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,160
I have to stand by General Secretary
Baek's side. Don't you know that?

710
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,460
Am I a fool that I
don't know that?

711
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,160
Why are you going to
do if you know that?

712
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,750
Would you like to
eat this together?

713
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,320
Would you like to eat together?

714
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,080
This chicken tastes
good with much flavor.

715
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,240
Answer me. Why are you going
to do if you know that?

716
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,710
- Why are you asking? You are
scary.<br>-Don't fool around with me.

717
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,080
Hurry and answer me!

718
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,560
Whether you are close to
General Secretary Baek or not,

719
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,760
I trust you unconditionally.

720
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,790
Do you think that makes sense?

721
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:55,960
Yes. For me, it makes sense. I
will trust you no matter what.

722
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,460
Why? Why do you have to
believe me unconditionally?

723
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,380
You really have a
lot of questions.

724
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,970
Let's eat chickens.

725
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,240
Here.

726
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,130
Don't you want to eat?

727
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,020
No one can make me a
proper assemblyman,

728
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,160
except you.

729
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,610
If I don't trust you,
whom will I trust?

730
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:28,010
If you are not here, I
can't be an assemblyman.

731
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,540
Assemblyman Jin.

732
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,100
Why, again?

733
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,520
Let's re-write the
questionnaire.

734
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,740
- Pass me.<br>-Yes.

735
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,360
<i> 2015 Supplementary Budget Bill</i>

736
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:27,220
Everyone, pay attention.

737
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,650
<i> To one of assemblymen at
Strategy and Finance Committee,</i>

738
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,840
<i>ask him to insist on
increasing the budget.</i>

739
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:47,840
<i>would there be an assemblyman with such
steely nerves to make that kind of call?</i>

740
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,500
<i>People with nerves of steel
are not the only brave ones.</i>

741
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,460
<i>Ignorant ones also
tend to be brave.</i>

742
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,140
Since it constitutes a quorum,
in the 345th Special session,

743
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,220
The first Strategy and Finance
Committee meeting will be opened.

744
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,540
Concerning the finance
ministry's agenda, paragraph 1.

745
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:22,020
The first supplementary budget bill in
2015 will be presented for discussion.

746
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:31,840
First, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of Strategy and Finance, Woo Tae Hyun,

747
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,390
please come out and
explain the bill.

748
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:46,320
Respectable SFC Chairman
Kang Sang Ho and Committee,

749
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,480
Chairman! I have a
proceedings comment.

750
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,080
Assemblyman Jo Woong Gyu, let's hear
the explanation of the bill first...

751
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,290
The explanation of the bill
is not important right now.

752
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,430
Go ahead.

753
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:05,500
I have examined the supplementary
budget bills several times but

754
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,300
I have never seen such an
insincere bill like this.

755
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,467
It is said the amount
of $ 15 billion of the

756
00:55:11,479 --> 00:55:13,900
budget will be funded by
issuing government bonds,

757
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,930
<i>Where is such an irresponsible
attitude like this?</i>

758
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,480
<i>Assemblyman Jo, let's talk about it
at the general discussion meeting.</i>

759
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,530
<i>Even though we have to
examine, from Deputy Prime</i>

760
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:28,810
<i>Minister, who is in charge
of this poor and hasty bill,</i>

761
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,700
we should hear an expression
of his regrets first.

762
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,000
Skip that part. I
don't have much time.

763
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,750
What are you saying now?

764
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,510
<i>The public are watching us.</i>

765
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,930
-The fighting cock wouldn't
let it go without a fight...

766
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,490
<i>What on earth did Deputy
Prime Minister do wrong?</i>

767
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,190
Did Assembly Jo act like
that in his school?

768
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:44,900
Then, what did you do well?

769
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,690
You are going too far!

770
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,980
Deputy Prime Minister! What are you doing?
Hurry and express your regrets!

771
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,090
From now on, we will start the
discussion of alternatives.

772
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:59,350
Assemblyman Jin Sang Phi,
ask questions first.

773
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,480
<i>Deputy Prime Minister</i>

774
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,100
<i> Plan for Economy Revitalization through
Increasing the Support of SOC Business</i>

775
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,320
Yes.

776
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,060
Yes...Ye.

777
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:31,380
I am Assemblyman Jin San Pil.

778
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,280
I will have a question to
the Deputy Prime Minister.

779
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,900
- Th...<br>- Assemblyman Jin, relax.
You have prepared well.

780
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,360
Yes.

781
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,460
Kang Sang Ho, he is too blunt.

782
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,230
Did you write the questionnaire
easy to be understood, right?

783
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:03,930
Yes. General Secretary.

784
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:08,680
Before posing a question,
to Deputy Prime Minister,

785
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:13,800
I want to tell the story
of a small businessperson.

786
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,840
What is he talking?

787
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,930
I am calling and telling you
that you'd better watch TV.

788
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:26,380
Would you turn on the Assembly
channel at the cable?

789
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:32,870
<i> After she graduated the commercial high
school, she got the job at a big company.</i>

790
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:36,240
She was promoted to the
head of department.

791
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,350
She did her job very well.

792
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:42,350
Whenever the company reorganized
to lay-off, none let her go.

793
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:45,170
But she thought
that if she quit,

794
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:51,400
she would save the jobs of her two junior
clerks. So she retired by herself.

795
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,690
Excuse me. Assemblyman Jin.

796
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:02,400
Please have a question only
about the budget bill.

797
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,570
My aide told me that I can do
whatever I want to during this time.

798
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:12,230
Please don't interrupt me.

799
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,860
I forgot what I wanted to tell.

800
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,030
Please take out
this from my time.

801
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,800
So, with her retirement
fund, savings,

802
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:26,730
and the bank loan, she
opened the coffee store.

803
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,610
Then, next to her store, a big
franchise opened the business.

804
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,200
Ultimately, to pay her loan,

805
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,909
<i>she took out the second
loan, used the credit</i>

806
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:37,530
<i>card loan, and did
everything she could do.</i>

807
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:41,870
Still it didn't work out, her
store was put up at auction.

808
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:47,230
Assemblyman, I am sorry but I don't
get your point what you are talking.

809
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,790
You don't know my point?

810
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,680
Assemblyman Jin!

811
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,880
Aicham! Seriously! My point is..

812
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,680
the debt is very dangerous
to the common people.

813
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,500
Ye.

814
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:05,640
You must pay back. If you don't pay
back, you will come to an end.

815
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,840
That is my point.

816
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,030
Now, I will have a question.

817
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,810
I agree the object that the
sluggish economics can be pepped up

818
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:22,070
by putting the additional budget.

819
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:25,590
But the additional budget makes
the nation get into debt.

820
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:28,730
The people who have to pay the
debt are our people in the end.

821
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,284
Therefore, we have to make
the additional budget

822
00:59:31,296 --> 00:59:33,600
as a minimum and put it
only as a necessity.

823
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,076
This committee thinks
that the whole budget for

824
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:38,680
Social Overhead Capital
(SOC) needs to be cut, and

825
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,000
the present $15 billion worth
of government bond issue

826
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,770
needs to be reduced.

827
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:47,670
Deputy Prime Minister,
please state your opinion.

828
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,200
<i>We will sincerely consider your opinion.</i>

829
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,210
Wow, he handled a thorny issue well.

830
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:06,100
When he can handle that he won't be
a problem to the party leadership.

831
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,690
Yes. Sunbae-nim.

832
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:19,590
I am a little disappointed
in you this time.

833
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,400
I am sorry that I didn't
tell you in advance.

834
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,990
Didn't I tell you what is
the best for Assembly Jin?

835
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,630
I am sorry but...

836
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:32,870
This is the best for him, what I chose.

837
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,390
Whose decision is right,

838
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,060
you will know little by little.

839
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,410
I understand.

840
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:56,290
Aide Choi, Assembly Jin
holds the microphone again.

841
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,240
What?

842
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,950
<i>Don't tell as like a snake
climbs over a wall.</i>

843
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,290
<i> Say clearly that you will
do what I said or not.</i>

844
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,970
As I said a little while ago,

845
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:12,720
Aigoo, I am getting nervous.

846
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,270
I will sincerely examine this.

847
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:19,200
Examine a lot.

848
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,590
I will tell you my posiiton exactly.

849
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:27,520
If this committee,
doesn't do what I said,

850
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,380
regardless of whether I belong
to a ruling party or not,

851
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:35,360
I will vote against the
supplementary budget bill.

852
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,300
<i> No. Assemblyman!</i>

853
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,070
Even if someone threatens
my life with a knife,

854
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,420
I will oppose, absolutely oppose.

857
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,320
<i>I want to know the reason
why you don't like me.</i>

858
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,160
<i>It is not that I don't like you.</i>

859
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,730
<i>It's that you are not a kid who fits here.</i>

860
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,630
<i>Of course, if you ruined the business,</i>

861
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,260
<i>it's obvious that you should
take the responsibility.</i>

862
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,810
<i>We thought he was our side but</i>

863
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:56,160
<i>he is x-man. What should we do?</i>

864
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,000
<i>I will watch the situation a little more.</i>

865
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,730
<i>Did Baek Do Hyeon screw you again?</i>

866
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:03,110
<i>The garbage dumping ground
where the human trashes live.</i>

867
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,020
<i>What did you say?</i>
