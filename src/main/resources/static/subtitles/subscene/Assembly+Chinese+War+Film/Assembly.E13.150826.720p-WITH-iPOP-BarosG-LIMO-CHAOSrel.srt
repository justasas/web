Secretary Oh, get the car ready quickly.
Yes.

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,730
I am really sorry. I should
be here until the end.

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,720
But I am behind schedule
at other events.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,940
Oh, don't mind us. Just work
hard on Assembly activities.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,490
Yes.

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,180
Hey, Gyu Hwan. You stay until the
end of the event instead of me.

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,410
Yes. I got it.

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,930
If you have something to tell
me, you can tell it to him.

13

Yes. I understand.<b>-

Secretary Kim. We
just collected some

20
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:09,550
donations quickly,
although it is not a lot.

21
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,481
Ah. If you provide it with
the donors' information,

22
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:15,380
I will make the political
funds' receipt available.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,400
I understand.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,540

Who was it?

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,550
You got an offer to appear on the radio
show, <i>"Greeting the Morning with Politics."</i>

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,700
Well. Let's do it.

30
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,840
I will do it in the usual way.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,910
By the way, what
is the main topic?

32
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,730
It's about the problems of
<i>Babel Tower City Complex's</i>

33
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:46,200
business, which is under
court receivership.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,260
Ahh. You mean the very tall building
built at the Han riverside?

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,629
Yes. It was said that it has been the
biggest single construction project

36
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:54,990
in the country since Dan Gun ( THE
FOUNDING FATHER OF THE KOREAN NATION).

37
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,750
It became a hippo eating money
due to construction delays.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,510
I will report to you as soon as
the questionnaire comes out.

39
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,550
Yes.

40
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,530
Oh yeah!

41
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,270
How is the remedial bill for
persons with bad credit going?

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,390
Well, we are working on it now.

43
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,630
We have to hurry.

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,376
Because I am probably known as a
person with bad credit, people

45
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,060
with poor credit from everywhere
are making repeated requests.

46
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,760
I feel sorry for them.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,500
Yes.

48
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,870

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,840
Within this month,
there are 5 activities

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,080
which were prevented due to a lack
of political funds.<b>- It's serious.</b>

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,540
Don't the fans of People's
Truth donate some?

55
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,650
They do. With their donation,

56
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,440
the office rent at the constituency
and Miss Lee's salary are paid.

57
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,780
There are some places that want
to contribute to Assemblyman Jin.

58
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,460
Where?<b>- It's too obvious.</b>

59
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,840
Companies and profit-seeking
organizations.

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,640
Can't only an
individual contribute?

61
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,030
There is a way to do it.

62
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,168
You are probably talking
about using a loophole like

63
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,290
cheating on how to contribute.
But we can't do that.

64
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,200
Everybody else is doing it. Why not us?
To do politics, we have to have money.

65
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,500
<i>You'd better clean
around Assemblyman Jin.</i>

66
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,710
Well. Attention!

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,954
From today, all staff in
this office will implement

68
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,200
an emergency system for
raising contributions.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,350
What do you mean
<i>raising contributions?</i>

70
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,433
Call an acquaintance who
pays the annual income tax

71
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:53,500
at more than $100 and ask
for a political donation.

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,128
Make sure to emphasize that the
donation is tax deductible so they will

73
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,780
be able to deduct $100 from their
income tax at the end of the tax year.

74
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,410
Yes.<b>- I will let you
know your quota.</b>

75
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,100
For interns, do as
much as they can.

76
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,770
For the regular staff, 100
people per staff member.

77
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,840
100 people?

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,810
Excuse me, Aide Choi. I haven't even
stored 100 people in my cell phone.

79
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,970
Be quiet! With Assemblyman
Jin's income,

80
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,290
we are using half of it to pay a debt and
the other half to do political activities.

81
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,650
Is it true?

82
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,380
Well, by all means, we
must raise the money.

83
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,310
Understand?

84
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,990
Do you understand?

85
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,580
Yes.

86
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,260
Aide Seo. I got chills just now.

87
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,700
Huh?<b> - I can sense the aroma of Madame
Hong (ASSEMBLYWOMAN HONG) from Aide Choi.</b>

88

Brrr... Ice!

89
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,400
What is this?

90
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,601
You look so depressed these days.
So I want

91
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:06,900
to give some support
under my husband's name.

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,810
You know I don't like much
give-and-take among the assemblymen.

93
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,860
This is not a give-and-take
but my heart.

94
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,190
Assemblywoman Hong.<b>-By the way,</b>

95
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,930
until when are you going to
let him swing like that?

96
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,270
Don't you worry? The public
opinion for him at Gyeongje City,

97
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,870
is getting much better,
compared to previously.

98
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,980
While he is swinging his arms, he
will be caught on his blind side.

99
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,900
A crack?

100
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,350
Yeah. I remember you were
getting interviewed.

101
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,300
Did you get a job?

102
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,470
Is that so? I am just

Yes. Yeah. Hang in there!

104
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,690
Aide Choi is out of
touch with reality.

105
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,630
Really, most people my
age have part-time jobs.

106
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,920
Who would donate, right?

<b>- No.</b>

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,580
No, not yet.

170
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,603
That's good. I'm going
to have a drink with the

171
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:13,650
reporter at Shin Han. Do
you want to go with me?

172
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,680
I am sorry. I don't feel good.
I will leave early.

173
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,620
Is that so? Go home
early and rest.

174
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,190
Yes.

175
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,620
I am right. I will
check it before bed.

176
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,750
Who will help if we don't
help our Assemblyman?

177
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,930
I know you have difficulties.

178
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,290
Even so, would you
help a little bit?

179
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,570
Hey! Assemblyman Jin didn't
betray Hyung Dal Soo.

180
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,310
Hello! Hello! Sh*t.

181
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,630
Let me see... [PARK MI JA]

182
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,950
I am not sure whether
Unni Mi Ja lives well.

183
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,590
Who is Mi Ja?

184
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,440
Bae Dal Soo's ex-wife.

185
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,780
Since she is tough, she lives well.
Very well.

186
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,708
She remarried another person
because her husband got disabled.

187
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,380
There is no reason for not
living well for such a person.

188
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,020
It's me again to ask something.

189
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,990
You were close to Unni Mi Ja who
worked in the accounting department.

190
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,300
Are you still in
contact with her?

191
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,550
<i>I don't contact her these days but when her
son marries, she will probably contact me.</i>

192
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,700
Is it already time
for him to marry?

193
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,250
Gyu Hwan is about 30 years old.

194
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:49,010
Ah. That's right. His name is Gyu Hwan.
Let's hang up.

195
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,140
Is Dal Soo's son going to marry?

196
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,670
He is not going to marry.
It's about time to marry.

197
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:02,270
Time flies. Gyu Hwan is
already about 30 years old.

198
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,460
Look at us, getting old.

199
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,170
Then, Ae Ri.

200
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,830
What are you doing?

201
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,530
Before getting old, we should...

202
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,630
<i>You are Bae Gyu
Hwan, aren't you?</i>

203
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,390
<i>Who are you?</i>

204
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,570
<i>You don't know me? Kim Jung
Min from Room 3 in 6th grade.</i>

205
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,950
<i>I was not sure because of
your glasses and your height.</i>

206
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,330
<i>You're mistaken.</i>

207
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Ae Ri! <b>- O.M.G!</b>

208
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,290
<i>Even if Hyung Dal Soo gets hired by a
subcontractor, he will not be able to work.</i>

209
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,880
<i>So let's just settle
without regard to him.</i>

210
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,230
<i>Are you sure?</i>

211
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,290
<i>We will not rehire Bae Dal Soo.</i>

212
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,940
<i>I understand.</i>

213
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,020
<i>010-0099-9915<b>South of Korea</i>.</b>

214
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,010
Hello?

215
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,910
<i>Did you see the transcription
of the recording?</i>

216
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,940
Who are you?

217
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,810
How did you know about me?

218
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,990
When Bae Dal Soo died, I was
busy with cleaning it up.

219
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,933
At that time, I got to
know that Bae Dal Soo had

220
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:23,780
a son over whom he gave
up his parental rights.

221
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,090
I was looking for him to
see how he is living.

222
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,710
Unexpectedly, he became Assemblyman
Jin's trustworthy secretary.

223
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,660
Why? Do you want to sue him?

224
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,550
What is your intention in sending
the transcription of the recording?

225
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,060
There is no way to confirm
your state of mind.

226
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,680
It surely looks like
you intended revenge.

227
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,600
I am not sure whether
you are acting,

228
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,160
but you look very close
to Assemblyman Jin.

229
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Assemblyman Jin,

230
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,730
he wouldn't do it like this.

231
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,090
I admit that Jin Sang Pil
is good and genuine.

232
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,140
But at the sight of a gold badge
flashing in front of his eyes,

233
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,520
people are bound
to lose control.

234
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,970
Jin Sang Pil is also a human
with basic instincts.

235
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,700
That's precisely the
greed for power.

236
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,940
Enough of the nonsense.

237
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,540
Are you just naive or stupid?

238
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,960
Some time after Secretary General Baek
proposed nomination to Jin Sang Pil,

239
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,258
violence broke out at the
protest site between

240
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,890
the laid-off employees
and the demolition crew.

241
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,790
So?

242
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,242
At the time, Jin Sang Pil
wasn't at the scene,

243
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:41,570
and Bae Dal Soo was
admitted to the hospital.

244
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,960
That's when Jin Sang Pil reached
a settlement with the company.

245
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,150
Do you think the link
was a coincedence?

246
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,600
While Jin Sang Pil was running
the election campaign,

247
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,928
Bae Dal Soo got arrested
and even jailed after

248
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,330
doing a one-man protest
in front of the company.

249
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,350
Haven't you thought that it might have
been at someone's request or pressure?

250
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,710
How could Secretary Kim
deceive us like that?

251
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,850
He did look familiar somehow.

252
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,000
That explains why he
sometimes put on glasses.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,820
Because he was afraid he would run
into someone he knew in Gyeongje City.

254
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,890
In case someone might
recognize him.

255
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,630
So what? Gyu Hwan is Dal Soo's
son, so what do you want me to do?

256
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,980
What do you mean, what to do?
We have to let him go.

257
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,820
Why?

258
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,090
What do you mean, why? Who
knows what he would do to you?

259
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,360
What harm would that kid
Gyu Hwan do to me? What?

260
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,648
He came here instead of working
for the police for which

261
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,000
he'd studied the whole time and
even got to the interview.

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,290
Just how much of a grudge
would he have had that

263
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,260
he would go all-in on you?

264
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,050
Assemblymen. I've also
become attached to him,

265
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,320
and it makes me sad to think
about what he's been through.

266
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,290
But even if we didn't realize what we
didn't know, because of who he is,

267
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,200
wouldn't it be impossible
to have him around?

268
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,060
I already knew that Gyu
Hwan was Dal Soo's son.

269
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,200
Huh?

270
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,020
You knew?

271
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,960
And you still went about
joking around with him?

272
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,540
I'm going to have him
by my side all the way.

273
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,730
So pretend you don't
know, please,

274
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,190
the fact that Gyu Hwan
is Dal Soo's son.

275
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,050
Assemblyman!<b>- When I
became an assemblyman,</b>

276
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,640
I was going to bring Dal
Soo to the Assembly.

277
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,080
That poor guy... No matter what,
by pulling strings or whatever,

278
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,140
I was going to get
him a good job.

279
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,750
But what happened to Dal Soo?

280
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,750
And then Gyu Hwan
showed up somehow.

281
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,620
Well, he probably
came for revenge.

282
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,400
I was actually pleased.

283
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,190
What?

284
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,060
I thought Dal Soo's son
was just a bastard son.

285
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,090
When he was going through
such rough times, I thought

286
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,950
he was a bastard for not even
calling or coming to see his dad.

287
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,640
But he came to take revenge for his dad.
How admirable is that?

288
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,620
Assemblyman.

289
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,420
For me, Gyu Hwan is Dal
Soo's replacement.

290
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,900
If I don't do anything wrong,
why would he do me any harm?

291
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,260
Even if he does,
whatever he does,

292
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,030
I'll be happy to take it.

293
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,590
So,

294
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,560
you two, please...
pretend you don't know.

295
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,450
This is hard.

296
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,240
What

297
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,590
do you want from me?

298
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:04,360
I know Jin Sang Pil is
pressed for political funds.

299
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,200
Now that he's become a celeb, he
has more things to take care of.

300
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,150
Along with more temptation.

301
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,430
Are you now telling me to give
you hints about his corruption?

302
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,310
You went in there
to do that anyway.

303
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,860
If you do that through me, we
can guarantee your safety.

304
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,910
Think about your father who
died tragically. You are...

305
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,400
You are Bae Dal Soo's son.

306
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,590
You're going to forget everything
after one drink, okay?

307
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,680
I'll think about that
after drinking first.

308
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,550
Seriously... I wonder
if this is okay.

309
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,050
Joo Hee's mom didn't
come in today?

310
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,390
No. She said she has an urgent
matter to take care of.

311
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,310
I see.

312
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,450
Is she having an affair?

313
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,490
Shush. Seriously.

314
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,200
Assemblyman, can I get
an autograph here?

315
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,420
I don't have an autograph.

316
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,980
What should I write...

317
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,760
<i>Provided accommodation for former
employees including Tax Accountant Kim...</i>

318
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,990
<i>for taking a bribe, they're
expected to request</i>

319
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:27,870
<i>an arrest warrant today
at the earliest.</i>

320
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,990
Look at that. It is
happening after all.

321
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,290
<i>Declared bankruptcy.</i>

322
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,890
<i>Babel Tower City which drew attention as a
future new landmark in 21st century Seoul,</i>

323
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,410
<i>as the world economy collapsed and
the real estate market suffered,</i>

324
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,040
<i>the business has
taken a huge hit.</i>

325
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,810
<i>Because of corruption and financial
difficulties during the permit process,</i>

326
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,850
<i>construction has stopped.</i>

327
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,860
<i>Today, because of financial insolvency,
they expect a fierce storm.</i>

328
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,440
<i>Especially for the individual investors
who expected a guaranteed high return</i>

329
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,810
<i>from the Babel Tower City Fund,

330
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,090
<i>This is Jeong Min
Ah from KBC News.</i>

331
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,560
In the end, I guess the thing that
should have exploded, exploded.

332
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,420
The minority party will seek a
parliamentary investigation.

333
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,150
Babel Tower City...

334
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:23,190
That's the abode of demons. If they
put their mind to digging it up,

335
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,750
lot of people will be hurt.

336
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,500
It could be turned into
a power type scandal,

337
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,160
and seriously undermine
next year's elections.

338
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,560
We'll have to stop this issue
from becoming politicized.

339
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,690
The Anti-BH faction should
keep the same pace with us.

340
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,940
But will the Anti-BH
faction's help be enough?

341
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:52,980
It's obvious that the Indifferent-to-BH
faction will feign ignorance again.

342
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,820
Parliamentary investigation?

343
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,154
<i>Yes. The ruling party is going to
insist that we investigate it during</i>

344
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,380
<i>the regular parliamentary session
through parliamentary inspection,</i>

345
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,280
without a separate
parliamentary investigation.

346
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,380
What do you think, Assemblyman?

347
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,150
Why not do both
the parliamentary

348
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:13,520
investigation and a
parliamentary inspection?

349
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,548
Then, let's have the press
conference announcing

350
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,580
your stance on a
parliamentary investigation.

351
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,610
Before the press conference, I
will send a memo to the press.

352
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,040
Okay. Well... Hello?

353
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,610
She always hangs up first.
She has no etiquette.

354
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,680
Did Aide Choi give you
an assignment again?

355
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:37,080
Yes. There is not a
day that I can rest.

356
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,660
Secretary Kim.

357
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,460
You drink this and then you
are going to go, right?

358
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,720
Yes. Thank you.

359
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,410
If you drank, you should have gone
straight home. Why did you come here?

360
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,590
I didn't feel like
going home and

361
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,790
I had no other place to go.

362
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,610
Suddenly, I thought about you.

363
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,860
Jeez.

364
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,120
Hey, stop with the nonsense and

365
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,720
hurry up and tell me.
What is going on?

366
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,620
It's nothing serious.

367
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,260
Just... Living is no fun.

368
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,000
What?

369
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,430
The person that I am...

370
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,270
I am so pathetic.

371
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,770
<i>For me, Gyu Hwan is Dal
Soo's replacement.</i>

372
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:57,330
<i>If I don't do anything wrong,
why would he do me any harm?</i>

373
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:03,410
<i>Even if he does,
whatever he does,</i>

374
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,670
<i>I'll be happy to take it.</i>

375
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,070
Kim Gyu Hwan,

376
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,160
I don't know why you are
acting this way but

377
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,800
from my viewpoint, you are now
living a satisfactory life.

378
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Is that true?

379
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,660
You know I am not the type to make
up something just to sympathize.

380
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,340
Just a moment.

381
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,520
Yes, Secretary Oh.

382
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,720
No matter how much I think
about it, you should know.

383
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,300
Yes, go ahead.

384
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,760
Secretary Kim... is
Bae Dal Soo's son.

385
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,070
I think he bears a grudge
against the Assemblyman.

386
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,290
I see.

387
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,070
I'll just go.

388
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,110
Oh.

389
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,050
Okay.

390
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,490
Oh, Aide,

391
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,650
I'm grateful.

392
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,150
Okay.

393
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,730
Get going.

394
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,320
Don't show it in
front of Gyu Hwan.

395
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,640
I told you I got it.

396
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,660
Oh?

397
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,030
Sister-in-law!

398
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,830
Why have you come...
Did something happen?

399
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,530
Why have you come?

400
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,700
You... can you help me?

401
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,840
Why? What is it?
What is the matter?

402
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,300
That is... I... was cheated...

403
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,220
Oh, Kyung Ah!

404
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,380
Why are you like
this?<b>-Sister-In-Law.</b>

405
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,880
Sister-In-Law, are you okay?

406
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,890
My money... Please
get my money back.

407
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,520
What money?

408
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,380
My money. Honey, please
get my money back.

409
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,080
Honey...

410
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,920
Babel Tower City Fund?

411
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,020
Because they said the return will be
a few times the deposited amount...

412
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,060
I was a crazy wench.

413
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,360
Where did you get that money?

414
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:29,640
The money I earned cooking meat and all
OF MOTHER'S MONEY: In total, $30,000.

415
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,510
Wow, this woman... really.

416
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,270
You are fearless. Fearless.

417
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,470
Honey. You are an assemblyman.

418
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,500
Can't you go meet with the
bank president just once?

419
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,070
You have power.

420
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,730
Can't you go tell him
to return my money?

421
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,860
Does what you say
make any sense?

422
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:57,940
That money... is my
mom's life-savings

423
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,580
and Joo Hee's college
tuition funds.

424
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,820
Having lost that
money, how can I live?

425
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,300
Because I am sorry
and mortified,

426
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,570
how can I face my
mother or Joo Hee?

427
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,410
Honey.

428
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:19,800
I am beg of you like this.
Please once!

429
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,530
<i>You can do it, can't you?</i>

430
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,010
<i>You can do it, right?</i>

431
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,550
You're home.

432
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,500
Yes.

433
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,290
Pretend that you don't know.
Okay?

434
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,750
Okay.

435
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,970
He looks like his dad.

436
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,788
The demise of Babel
Tower City is a tragedy

437
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,320
created by pariah-capitalism
to make easy money

438
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,460
and current government's
incompetence.

439
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,786
If there's truth to uncover,
we can reveal it as

440
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,040
much as we want at the
parliamentary inspection

441
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,930
which will be held during the next
regular parliamentary session.

442
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,730
I am asking the majority party.
The citizens are wailing...

443
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,230
The opposing party must first correct the
habit of trying to politicize everything.

444
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:15,130
We need to open a parliamentary
inspection immediately.

445
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,410
The citizens are watching.

446
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,790
How's the public opinion?

447
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,810
Although it shows that we should open a
parliamentary investigation by 6 to 4,

448
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,170
we can more than hold out.

449
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,250
Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil is the variable.

450
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,250
If even a member of the ruling party
demands parliamentary investigation,

451
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,890
we may lose the currently
tight public opinion battle.

452
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,690
But Assemblyman Jin's
response is a bit unusual.

453
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,600
What do mean by strange?

454
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
According to reporters,
he said he was going

455
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,400
to hold a press
conference this morning.

456
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,840
They just got an email saying
that it will be delayed.

457
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,780
The so-called "accompanying
secretary" overslept

458
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,200
and didn't even know that the Assemblyman
had gone out. Does that make sense?

459
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,060
I'm sorry.

460
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,900
Usually Secretary Kim or
Assemblyman wakes me up.

461
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,700
Today, the two of them left.

462
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,840
Secretary Kim's phone
has been turned off.

463
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,360
Last night, did something
happen to the Assemblyman?

464
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,850
What?

465
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,550
What happened? Nothing happened.

466
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,330
Looking at you, something
must have happened.

467
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,500
I said nothing happened. Ae
Ri, why are you saying that?

468
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,050
I see you everyday to know.

469
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,060
Hurry up and talk!

470
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,330
What's going on?

471
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:36,450
To be honest, Sister-In-Law
came by our house last night.

472
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,151
<i>Exclusive benefits for
Hanmin Bank's main branch</i>

Return my life's-blood money!

487
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,711
Secretary General, I have
found out why Assemblyman

488
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:24,290
Jin Sang Pil postponed
the press conference.

489
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,970
Hanmin Bank's President Kim called and said
Assemblyman Jin had asked for a meeting.

490
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,110
Why?<b>- It's because of the
Babel Tower City Fund.</b>

491
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,950
His wife supposedly
suffered a huge loss.

492
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,470
President Kim asked
me what he should do.

493
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,870
I drew a firm line, telling him it was not
something we would get involved with.

494
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,570
In that case,
President Kim seems

495
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,870
to have only one choice.

496
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,530
How are you going to
compensate the damages?

497
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,670
I am sorry about
your wife's losses.

498
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,970
Am I here right now in the
capacity of my wife's husband?

499
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,810
What?<b>- Am I here as
my wife's husband?</b>

500
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,690
Can't you see this, huh?

501
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:23,230
When you sold this fund,
about how risky it is,

502
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,790
how an investor might
even lose his shirt,

503
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,170
I heard that you did not
fully explain that.

504
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,890
I asked the people outside and heard
that there was material omission.

505
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:39,650
No, everything is spelled out in
the investment funds brochure.

506
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,650
But when a seemingly
reputable bank like this

507
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,150
keeps luring them with high
interest and huge returns,

508
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,170
of course they will believe
the words, rather than read

509
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,810
the itty-bitty fine print on paper.
Then, President,

510
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,925
do you read all these
warnings before buying

511
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:57,970
them? No, you just trust
them and buy them!

512
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,950
Because they advertise and
say they are delicious!<b>- Jeez.</b>

513
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,010
Compensate the clients' damages.

514
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,610
Assemblyman, because
of this incident,

515
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,630
not only the clients but the bank
too has suffered enormous losses.

516
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,530
Look here, the people
outside right now

517
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,550
are about to lose
their life savings!

518
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,690
They are about to swallow their
tongues and commit suicide!

519
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:35,230
I, I tell you this in no
uncertain terms, President!

520
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,690
I will subpoena you to an
Assembly investigation hearing.

521
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,670
Inject it!

522
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,530
Return my lifeblood money!

523
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,770
Return it!<b>Return it!</b>

524
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:53,830
Inject public funds and
return my lifeblood money!

525
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,650
Excuse me.

526
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,090
Return my lifeblood money!

527
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,230
Are you Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil's secretary?

528
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,430
Yes, I am.

529
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:06,550
Here. This is a free present
given to VIP clients.

530
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,490
How can you act like this with
the press conference coming up?

531
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:47,460
I am sorry. I had a
personal errand to run.

532
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,410
Did you see the Hanmin
Bank President?

533
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:56,790
I heard that your
wife suffered losses.

534
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,870
You shouldn't concern
yourself with that.

535
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:09,230
Don't be like this and
give me the details.

536
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,630
Because that president
is a master of lobbying,

537
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,690
I feel uneasy. That's
why I am asking...<b>- Well,</b>

538
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,170
I told you it was
none of your concern.

539
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:26,170
Before being an assemblyman,
I am Kim Kyung Ah's husband.

540
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,550
I will take care of it myself.

541
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,510
The press conference originally scheduled
for this morning was put off to 7 p.m.

542
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,770
If you demand an
Assembly investigation,

543
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:45,110
the opposition parties can draw the ruling
party out to the negotiating table.

544
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,640
I will give it a thought.<b>- What?</b>

545
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,560
I said let me think about it,
since we still have time.

546
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,160
Okay.

547
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,500
What about Secretary Kim?
He's not back, yet?

548
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,120
He said he was going to drop
by the Assemblyman's house.

549
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,550
Why the Assemblyman's
house, all of a sudden?

550
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,200
I wouldn't know that.

551
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,870
<i>He seems to bear a grudge
towards the Assemblyman.</i>

552
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,150
What is it?

553
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,330
I thought it was about time
that you told me something.

554
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,890
Today, there was that meeting
with Bank President Kim.

555
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,050
What are you talking about?

556
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,550
<i>A chance like this does not come often.
You must steel your heart.</i>

557
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,693
Oh, oh, and to err on the
side of caution, don't

558
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:57,410
even think about not
delivering it to him.

559
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,370
Aide-nim!

560
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,970
What were you doing
here just now?

561
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,290
Move. I said move!

562
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,670
What is this?<b>- What's
the matter with you?!</b>

563
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,690
Won't you give it to me?
Give it to me!

564
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:16,130
I am sorry. Sorry...

565
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,750
This is for Joo Hee, drop
it off at the house.

566
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,410
Okay, I got it.

567
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,590
What is this? Did you get
a complimentary gift?

568
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,390
What is this?

569
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:58,350
I can't do it, so you
return it, Assemblyman.

570
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,070
What, punk?

571
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:05,370
If you return this, what are you going
to do about your wife's lost money?

572
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,610
I heard that you are using all your
salary for political funds too.

573
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,710
At this rate, do you think you can
afford to send Joo Hee to college later?

574
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,990
This punk, seriously! Do you
really want to take some beating?

575
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,290
Stop posturing.

576
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,958
This money... They are
definitely giving it to you

577
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,450
so you won't ask for
investigation by the Assembly.

578
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,590
You just have to
keep silent once.

579
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,730
Ahew, this troublemaker,
really...

580
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,770
You are going ahead with the evening's
press conference as planned, right?

581
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,130
If you lend your
support, without fail,

582
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,550
we will secure an investigation
by the Assembly.

583
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:49,630
Yes, right... Is there...
a problem?

584
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,990
No, not a problem, but just

585
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,570
personally, I have a
lot to think about.

586
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,710
That we will not respond at all to
demands for an Assembly investigation

587
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,830
is our party's both Pro- and
Anti-BH factions' firm position.

588
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,730
Why don't you start worrying about
your graceful exit strategy now?

589
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,110
If an Assembly investigation won't work,
then we will ask for a special prosecutor.

590
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,550
Because you had no confidence to push
through a special prosecutor's appointment,

591
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,250
you clamored for an Assembly
investigation, isn't that so?

592
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,730
By the way, did you pay off
Jin Sang Pil or something?

593
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,050
What do you mean pay off?<b>-
He seemed ass-whooped.</b>

594
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,970
Are you blackmailing him
with some flaw of his?

595
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:36,790
Well, maybe he is
finally growing up.

596
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,230
Assemblyman Park,
there is a rumor

597
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,550
that Jin Sang Pil is reluctant to
hold this evening's press conference.

598
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,268
For a person who used
to wriggle out at every

599
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,010
turn, like a baby octopus
out of a market bag,

600
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:51,030
why is he, all of a sudden,
being a shrinking violet?

601
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,930
If a person does something
out of the ordinary,

602
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,290
that means he is feeling
sheepish about something.

603
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:02,610
Then, perhaps, Jin Sang Pil

604
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,600
grabbed himself some breadcrumbs
from that Babel place?

605
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:08,890
And you?

606
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,180
Aish, what do you take me for?

607
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,010
Until this day and
hour, I have never

608
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:21,090
even once stood in the lobby
of the prosecutors' office.

609
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,350
If Jin Sang Pil

610
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,440
does not hold a
press conference,

611
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,830
for sure, it feels like he
has received something.

612
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,400
It must be rat poison, huh?

613
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,220
Return our lifeblood money!

614
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,600
Return it...<b>Return it...</b>

615
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,480
We'll take an hour break.

616
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,990
Mom, it must be hard for you.

617
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,530
Joo Hee...

618
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,020
I am sorry.

619
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,950
It's okay, Mom. Don't cry.

620
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,930
Mommy is

621
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,290
really sorry.

622
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,560
What do we do now?

623
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,690
<i>That money is my
mom's life-savings</i>

624
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,410
<i>and Joo Hee's college
tuition funds.</i>

625
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,810
Hello?

626
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:46,300
I will see you tonight at
7:30 at the same place.

627
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,550
Are you saying he asked
to meet first, for sure?

628
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,980
Yes.

629
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,460
Kim Gyu Hwan must have caught
Jin Sang Pil accepting a bribe.

630
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,590
I understand.

631
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,180
I am sorry, it was
a pressing matter.

632
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,210
At any rate, an
Assembly investigation

633
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,310
must be stopped no matter what.

634
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:26,220
Please tell the Elder that such a
thing will never come to pass.

635
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,090
Really, will it be okay if I
report it to him like that?

636
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,950
Of course.

637
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:41,140
<i>The customer cannot be reached.
After the beep...</i>

638
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,100
It looks like the Assemblyman
will not hold a press conference.

639
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,770
You still cannot reach
the Assemblyman?

640
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,950
Right, his phone is
still turned off.

641
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,260
Is someone working
on the Assemblyman?

642
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,550
Working?

643
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,840
This (MONEY SIGN), I mean...

644
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,350
Hello... Assemblyman!

645
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,430
Where in the world
are you right now?

646
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,590
Ahew, really stinks,
the smell of it.

647
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,520
<i>I will come to the media room
with your prepared statement.</i>

648
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,820
<i>No, not that.</i>

649
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,160
Let's go with
something stronger.

650
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,820
What?

651
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,200
Yes, I am Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil,

00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:33,570

from selection of the developer

664

and government permits, to the
borrowing of an astronomical sum.

Assemblyman Jin Sang.

Pil is giving a press
conference and...

677
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,630
Did he demand an
Assembly investigation?

678
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,640
Not an Assembly
investigation, but

679
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,000
a special prosecution.

680
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,440
Finally,

681
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,970
I would like to convey
my true feeling

682
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,310
to one person among
many victims,

683
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,600
in despair

684
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,930
over this catastrophe.

685
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,760
<i>Joo Hee's mom,</i>

686
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,040
I am really sorry.

687
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,020
No matter what I had to do,

688
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,870
I really wanted to get
you your money back,

689
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,730
that lifeblood money

690
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,600
you saved up by serving
meat and doing dishes.

691
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,270
But I realized I am no longer
a person who should do that.

692
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:18,000
I realized that I am not a person
who can just look after my family.

693
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:22,420
Those people who were
crying with you...

694
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,840
I realized that I am a person

695
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,970
who must care about
those people as well.

696
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,550
Mom...

697
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,570
I am really sorry.

698
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,630
I am sorry, Kyung Ah.

699
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,060
That is all.

700
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,200
Say hello. This is Secretary
General Baek Do Hyeon.

701
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,170
Have a seat.

702
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:38,370
The reason I came today is to put
you at ease, Mr. Kim Gyu Hwan.

703
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:44,180
Please trust me and say
anything without reservation.

704
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:48,770
Then, I will tell you honestly.

705
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,400
Because I was not convinced by Chief
Secretary Lim's transcript alone,

706
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,300
I put temptation in his way.

707
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,747
Don't be impertinent and beat
around the bush. Just cut to

708
00:49:03,759 --> 00:49:06,260
the chase, about his meeting
with the Hanmin Bank President!

709
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,130
The chase?

710
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,390
This glass of water,

711
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:25,310
consider it thrown at Chief
Secretary Lim instead of you.

712
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:30,910
The one who hurt my father, the one
who made the police arrest my father!

713
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,550
Surely, it was all

714
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,730
your doing, Secretary
General Baek.

715
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:40,240
Won't you shut up!

716
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,390
Enough.

717
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,360
You can leave now.

718
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,740
Secretary General, I am sorry!

719
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,940
Secretary Kim.

720
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,470
Aide-nim.

721
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,940
About what happened to
the Assemblyman today,

722
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,810
will you tell me?

723
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,740
Why are you asking me?

724
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,170
No matter how much
I think about it,

725
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:00,240
the errand you ran today

726
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,190
doesn't seem to be limited
to Joo Hee's stationery.

727
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,910
The bribe the bank
president gave,

728
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:13,930
I delivered it to the
Assemblyman, satisfied?

729
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:21,000
If you tell me to quit, I
will quit working here.

730
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,850
Kim Gyu Hwan!

731
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,240
I hope you

732
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,800
get the weight off
your chest now

733
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,670
and work cheerfully.

734
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,860
What do you mean by
that?<b>- I know that</b>

735
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,500
your biological father is Mr.
Bae Dal Soo.

736
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,640
The Assemblyman

737
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:04,500
has known about it a
lot longer than I.

738
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,610
Knowing who I am,

739
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,870
why did he let me
be all this time?

740
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:20,060
Because to the Assemblyman,

741
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,870
you are the same as Mr.
Bae Dal Soo.

742
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,830
The Assemblyman

743
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,640
wanted to come to the
National Assembly,

744
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,340
together with Mr. Bae Dal Soo.

745
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,640
The Assemblyman is seeing
your late father through you.

746
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,110
Kim Gyu Hwan,

747
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,980
let it all go now.

748
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,190
I will leave first.

749
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,570
That's right, Joo Hee.

750
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:16,310
You have to stay by your mom's
side and take care of her.

751
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,100
Umm.

752
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,060
Call me right away
if anything happens.

753
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,930
Oh, okay. Good night.

754
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,570
Aide Choi!

755
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,190
Secretary Kim has disappeared
without a trace.

756
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:07,260
I heard that you had
found out, too,

757
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,850
that Gyu Hwan is
Hyung Dal Soo's son.

758
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,600
Yes.<b>- Did you...</b>

759
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,650
maybe tell Secretary Kim?

760
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:24,980
Yes.

761
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,410
Why did you tell him?

762
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,710
Why did you tell
him about it, WHY?

763
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,190
Because I couldn't

764
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,798
turn a blind eye to Secretary
Kim suffering between

765
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,430
his feelings of vengeance
and admiration toward you.

766
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,790
I am sorry.

767
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,670
Aide Choi didn't
do anything wrong.

768
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:53,120
Secretary Kim has to live
his own life, too, now.

769
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,540
That is right.

770
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,260
How much must that nice lad

771
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,500
have suffered in his heart?

772
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,740
<i>I am sorry.</i>

773
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:20,480
<i>I don't have the courage to
face you as Bae Gyu Hwan.</i>

774
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,730
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

775
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,980
<i>But, Assemblyman,</i>

776
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,770
<i>I really despised you
at the beginning.</i>

777
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:30,510
<i>Now,</i>

778
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,270
<i>I admire you.</i>

779
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,540
<i>Please take care of your health.</i>

780
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,980
Ah, this troublemaker, really...

781
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,603
<i>The bill appointing a special
prosecutor to investigate the.</i>

782
00:55:58,615 --> 00:56:01,620
<i>Babel Tower City bankruptcy has
passed the National Assembly.</i>

783
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,370
<i>The Assembly originally took a passive
position, but when popular opinion</i>

784
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,345
<i>favoring a special
prosecutor erupted after.</i>

785
00:56:06,357 --> 00:56:08,660
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's
moving press conference,</i>

786
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,936
<i>the Assembly passed the special
prosecutor bill led by the</i>

787
00:56:10,948 --> 00:56:13,080
<i>opposition parties and Gookmin
Party's Anti-BH faction.</i>

788
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,356
<i>When the special prosecutor is
installed, the businessmen and</i>

789
00:56:15,368 --> 00:56:17,620
<i>government officers involved in
the Babel Tower City project,</i>

790
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,560
<i>the so-called den of fiends, are expected
to be subpoenaed one after another...</i>

791
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,290
You've seen it now, right?
That is who I am.

792
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,180
Yes, you're so great.

793
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:34,230
But Secretary General Baek must have
received a huge blow this time.

794
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:37,870
That special prosecutor bill was passed
because the Anti-BH faction betrayed him.

795
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:41,310
That is what the Anti-BH faction aimed for.

796
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:46,140
To deal Secretary General Baek a deathblow.

797
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,380
I will relay the VIP's message.

798
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,370
He asks you to step down voluntarily
from the Secretary General's position.

799
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:04,240
W-what did you say just now?

800
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,720
Because he said you were to announce
it this week, get ready for it.

801
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,210
I will see the Elder

802
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,280
and hear it from him directly.

803
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:25,460
Let alone a private meeting, he said he
didn't even want you to contact him.

804
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,030
Yes, this is Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, the
people's servant who always tries his best.

805
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,380
Ah, yes, is that so?
Then I am Barack Obama.

806
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,860
Sheesh, really.

807
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,660
Who is it for you to answer it like that?

808
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,480
It was a prank call. He
said he was the President.

809
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,370
Since I'm so popular nowadays, I'm
getting tons of prank calls too.

810
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:11,240
The President?<b>- Yes.</b>

811
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,110
Yes, this is Choi In Kyung.

812
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,870
Yes,

813
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:33,890
I am currently serving as
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's aide.

814
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:40,780
Yes, he is next to me right now.

815
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,790
- Please take the call.<b>
- Who is it for you to be so tense?</b>

816
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,880
Hello?<b><i>- Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil?</i></b>

817
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,590
Yes, that's me. Who are you?

818
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,710
<i>I... am the President.</i>
