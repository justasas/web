<i>Britain, 420 AD</i>

00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:44,981
<i>The Roman Empire has called all its troops
home .. .</i>

4
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:47,568
<i>when it ended the occupation of the country,</i>

5
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:49,459
<i>leaving it in turmoil.</i>

6
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:51,715
<i>In every province of Britain, </ i ></i>

7
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:55,690
<i>the local tribal chief has declared himself
king of that region </i>

8
00:00:55,691 --> 00:01:00,101
<i>and each king wars with
another for more territory.</i>

9
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:04,302
<i>Now, the Saxon Barbarians have started
invading the shores</i>

10
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:07,885
<i>trying to conquer Britain for themselves.</i>

11
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:10,600
<i>A Dark Age in Britain has begun.</i>

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,725
<i>The time lost in history.</i>

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,838
<i>The time of legends, violence, and bloodshed.</i>

14
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:19,807
<i> Magic and mythical creatures.</i>

15
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:23,641

MERLIN.

17
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:45,485
MERLIN   "The War Of The Dragons"

18
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,911
That's right.

19
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,245
Push!


20
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:01,145
Push.

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,280
A message sir.

22
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,333
Reads: Kill the child.

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,954
Killing is the safest way.

24
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:31,605
But not the wisest.

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,243
This child

26
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:38,098
If the offspring of a demon
can be called a child.

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
I believe your daughter...

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,524
that no man, but rather an evil spirit come down...

29
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:46,931
and second advantage is of the basic goodness

30
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:48,432
and purity.

31
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,865
Nor, do I confess the  nature of her .....

32
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,892
... only the nature of the spirit.

33
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:57,182
which must have been evil
to fire herself.

34
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,040
One  needs  look no further at the chaos

35
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,796
in the Heavens of Pyra, My Lord!

36
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:05,254
To see basic evil ...
Quiet!

37
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm tired of your words.

38
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,064
I... I'm tired of yours...

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,060
The pupil should not challenge the Master.

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,290
I've counselled you

41
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,616
so ...I did to your father,

42
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:33,150
and his father and his ..

43
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,649
and many other kings of Wales and Britain.

44
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,225
.. over these many years ..

45
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:40,832
Healing the plague and the famine.

46
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:43,447
Kept the Roman legions in proper fear ...

47
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:44,630
... of invading these lands.

48
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,019
Yes... You and your Druid priests...

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,355
.. took their pains and sacrifice when you need it.

50
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:53,855
Did you not ?

51
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:57,727
I want the child !

52
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,130
More! More !

53
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,862
I have seen a vision of the Oak tree...

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,160
associated with this child.

55
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:12,609
So you say this child's father is the...

56
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,110
... spirit of the underworld?

57
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,611
Evil spirits.

58
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,793
which is why, it is better 

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,207
and safer to kill the child.

60
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,700
to have no evil spirits here.

61
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,807
Or would it be better not to risk ...

62
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,817
the wrath of dark Gods, by killing it !

63
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:16,408
20 years later...

64
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,900
Merlin, let me see.

65
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,366
Good.

66
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,692
One last lesson .

67
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,582
What would you like to learn ?

68
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,540
I would like to learn how to read minds.

69
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,010
A simple preposition...

70
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:50,858
To read a person's mind...

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,820
you must know heart.

72
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:54,873
Study them.

73
00:05:55,343 --> 00:05:58,394
you must understand what it's like to be then.

74
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:03,917
Only then you'll be able to place yourself
in the minds of the eye.

75
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:07,304
and you will be able to read their minds.

76
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,484
But that is not magic.

77
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,858
Yes, but it also equally as well.

78
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,661
One should not think first of magic...

79
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,951
if you can
accomplish the thing  in other means.

80
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,850
Merlin, what would you like to learn ?

81
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,420
I would  like to learn how to create light.

82
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,952
The spell you  seek  is an ancient.

83
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:29,948
I rarely use it.

84
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,556
In dark places...

85
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:36,406
it would call attention to me ..
as much as it one's vision.

86
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:11,373
Let me try again.

87
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,380
That's what I would call
attention to one's ......

88
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,449
Has he ever shown you that book?

89
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,000
The Book of Spells?

90
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,714
No.

91
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,444
Hasn't he shown you ever ?

92
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
No.

93
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:54,920
I doubt you  could even read it

94
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,070
And you could?

95
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:58,661
Ofcourse.

96
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,094
I have studied ancient scripts.

97
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:10,809
This 'Book of Secrets', handed down from one
..to the next.

98
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,440
One thousand years of knowledge.

99
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:16,162
we change
back into the Hiboriaanse Ages.

100
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,048
Everything we need is in that book.

101
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:25,462
He must have his reasons.

102
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,963
He's afraid.

103
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:31,334
You and I ,the power we have  is within us.

104
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:34,175
It was his ....from these pages .

105
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:37,161
I don't think we are so different from him.

106
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,925
May be hiding something from you.

107
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,144
Like what?

108
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:45,329
Has he ever told you who your father is?

109
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:47,691
We are orphans.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,993
If he knew who is our father
he would have told us.

111
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:53,146
You're naive.

112
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,339
There are spells in that book,
that you can read the past.

113
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,530
Show you where you came from.

114
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:02,204
He is hiding  not from you.

115
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,963
Do not you want to know who you really are?

116
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:34,788
Use your spell.

117
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,164
<i>come along</i>

118
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,973
<i>to me.</i>

119
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:54,653
It is enchanted!
-...keep watch !

120
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:02,953
<i>abracadabra</i>

121
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,235
How did you get ?

122
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:16,735
I do not know.

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,292
It .. just ... by itself.

124
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:21,723
Ask it something.

125
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,827
Show Merlin his father !

126
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,521
His father.

127
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:30,167
Focus on that.

128
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:28,171
<i>Claus.</i>

129
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:33,976
Merlin.

130
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:37,731
Vendiger, put it down!

131
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,739
<i>Paira ..Release him!
</i>

132
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,587
Release him ..

133
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:49,248
Release him... Paira

134
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,087
<i>abracadabra</i>

135
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,200
I've failed...

136
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,807
all  What I ...telling you

137
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
I cann't see now.

138
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,585
Has great power .. in this book.

139
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,229
Neither you nor Merlin are ready.

140
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,729
I disagree.

141
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:52,449
If you wish to remain under my guardianship,
Master Vendiger

142
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,087
... you will adhere to the time and honour the traditions.

143
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:58,257
I trained you as I was trained.

144
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,650
and show  the magicians before me.

145
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,858
Now, Come on.
Let us fix what is needed.

146
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,958
Merlin needs our help.

147
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:09,529
So, is about Merlin, isn't it?

148
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,505
I have no favorites.
Really?

149
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:18,583
If it were I ,
call from the ground like a crying baby?

150
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,026
How can you say, I am worried ?

151
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,931
I left him there to attend to you.

152
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:24,836
You  came for the book.

153
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:29,130
You and Merlin're like sons to me

154
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,753
You're not my father.

155
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
Come.

156
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,156
There are things to do.

157
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,869
Merlin needs you

158
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:43,614
There is still time to undo the damage
which you have done


159
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,229
You're making a mistake.

160
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,556
I have failed you too.

161
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,085
I need your help.

162
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,561
Bless the gods and...

163
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:33,941
I would not finish, if I were you.

164
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,036
Will you help me?

165
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,027
Is this the great Merlin?

166
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,267
Rest, Merlin.

167
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,297
Merlin , Good morning .

168
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,600
I would like you to introduce to the Lady Nimue.

169
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,850
Hello.

170
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:45,085
Where am I?

171
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,585
My sanctuary.

172
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,742
Private study.

173
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:52,679
Deep within the earth, beneath the Oak Tree.

174
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,829
Here one can work undisturbed.

175
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,322
Well, it is the home of Lady Nimue

176
00:16:58,323 --> 00:16:59,996
What happened to me?

177
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:06,936
Vendiger's spell put you
in contact with your father.

178
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,176
That thing...

179
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,344
That could not be my father.

180
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:20,159
I'm afraid so.

181
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:27,733
I am no child of a demon.

182
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:30,462
Your vision...

183
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:32,657
was not about an Oak tree?

184
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:39,868
We need more proof than a mere birth mark.

185
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:42,626
Turn it over and one can see an Oak tree...

186
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:45,992
... yet this way, See something entirely different.

187
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:50,478
Who you are, does not come from your father or mother.

188
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,786
Not even your status or your family.

189
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:56,939
Who'll be...
comes from you within.

190
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:01,588
You're the offspring of God.

191
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:04,513
But how much of these powers lying in you...

192
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:06,753
... and for what purposes you would use them,

193
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,801
only you can determine

194
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:00,426
What is she?

195
00:19:01,445 --> 00:19:04,735
- One such ...can be powerful allies

196
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:07,656
... otherwise the enemies.

197
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:10,473
There are many Gods...

198
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,836
Still about in this world...

199
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,577
if you choose to see them .

200
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,169
Not what you expected, huh?

201
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,221
<i>EMPIRIA</i>

202
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,467
to me!

203
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:12,062
Dragon! Dragon !
Dragon! Dragon ! Dragon !!!

204
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:18,312
Fight!

205
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:20,957
Fight!

206
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,149
Please, every one...

207
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,692
I'm just a traveler passing through...

208
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:07,620
I only ask  one thing...

209
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:10,849
That we shall celebrate this night together.

210
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:17,130
that we can share this water .. for victory!

211
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:21,503
Drink.

212
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:33,245
We should attack before
the spirits weakened

213
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:35,529
Every day, people  leave our ranks.

214
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:38,130
Hengest, has taken us this far, perhaps you know ?

215
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:41,044
We should take the kingdom for ourselves.
Instead of protecting these fools...

216
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:44,264
..from our labour.

217
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,370
I wish to join your army.

218
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:58,243
What skills could you possibly have ?

219
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,005
100 of your finest men...

220
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:12,506
can not kill me.

221
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:15,327
Naive Ling, I'll crush you right now.

222
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,828
May be, sir.

223
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:21,749
Aren't you curious that why I
would make such a claim ?

224
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,194
What is it you want?

225
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,684
I want what you want.

226
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,845
Are you not Hengest...

227
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:16,500
..who hated Vortingen, and the Picts
drove in securing the kingdom ?

228
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,017
Same, if I am correct.

229
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,830
which was rewarded by being expelled...

230
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,120
from the very large .. spell  bloodhood.

231
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:30,469
I want the same as you.

232
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:34,374
Take back what is mine.

233
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,875
Well, Tom !

234
00:28:02,185 --> 00:28:03,774
the verdict remains the same.

235
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:08,173
The Gods are telling that evil is approaching ...

236
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:11,253
Evil that threatens the foundation of your kingdom.

237
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,829
Evil, that has been brought about a dark spirit,

238
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,441
that took human form

239
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,556
and has now reached adulthood.

240
00:28:20,495 --> 00:28:21,554
His power...

241
00:28:21,554 --> 00:28:23,937
strengthens Saxon
and is back to this land...

242
00:28:23,937 --> 00:28:26,286
... to over run it, to become his servant
and

243
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:29,576
to kill all who stand in his way.

244
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:32,667
So you  must kill him.

245
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,716
It's Merlin.

246
00:28:34,985 --> 00:28:36,915
Before he means death for us all.

247
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,976
Mage! 

248
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:53,928
We've come for a guy called Merlin.

249
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,180
Come on, now.
No!

250
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,130
But... No!

251
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,473
You must have some idea.

252
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:10,543
For the hundredth time... No!

253
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:15,226
I see you never wearing gun.

254
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:18,069
My weapon... is up .. here!

255
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,420
I'm sorry to hear that.

256
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,754
Is it your magic, that protects you?

257
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:27,792
Show me something.

258
00:29:28,485 --> 00:29:29,908
What do you like to watch ?

259
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:31,408
Make something.

260
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:33,655
How about ??

261
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:35,322
Supper !

262
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,452
Magic is not something that is use it on whim

263
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:44,045
He can not do it.

264
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:45,264
He thinks not.

265
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:57,407
<i>INMRI Hira</i>

266
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,395
<i>INMRI Hira</i>

267
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:28,405
You first.

268
00:30:38,678 --> 00:30:40,178
smell that?

269
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:49,745
Picts.

270
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:51,705
This is nuetral territory.

271
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:55,180
.. Come and leave as they please

272
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,700
You wish you have  a  weapon on you now .

273
00:32:32,185 --> 00:32:34,469
It is he... the evil one.

274
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,130
I know nothing.

275
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:42,467
I know the terror agencies of the evil spirits.

276
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:45,057
They bringing down troubles upon us.

277
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:48,769
Now... shall be slain.

278
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:54,961
And your blood will be scattered
around the castle grounds....

279
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,039
...to appease the gods.

280
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,290
This is the only way that the Gods...

281
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,960
... will realize our committments to the task

282
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,418
to relieve this land of all evils.

283
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,529
I think its worthy that the Gods
help

284
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:08,227
to defeat Saxons.

285
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:11,347
You'll destroy yourself only hope...

286
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:13,605
in defeating Saxon?

287
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,125
Mage.

288
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:22,373
I have seen visions of the one
who bears the mark of Oak Tree.

289
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:24,474
He will bring ruins on us.

290
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,602
death and destruction.

291
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,893
It is your ...life to be
so wrong in your vision.

292
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:33,446
Voltinger ..

293
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:35,566
Why do you create a storm...

294
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:39,042
... so low over the ground rages
and to reach the sky

295
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,380
What do you see?

296
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:23,094
A Dragon.

297
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,076
A White Dragon.

298
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:29,576
What?

299
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,736
A White Dragon.

300
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:35,070
I see it too !

301
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:39,030
There!

302
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:46,067
Dragon!

303
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,202
Dragon!

304
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:51,714
Dragon!

305
00:34:58,351 --> 00:34:59,851
Archers, Take the wall.

306
00:35:05,576 --> 00:35:07,281
We may not be abe to destroy .

307
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:09,896
At least we should try.

308
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,021
We must  work together.

309
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:27,542
Who sent you?

310
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:52,569
Mage!

311
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,287
We now have a chance to escape to the beast.
Kill him!

312
00:36:07,287 --> 00:36:08,973
My Lord, this man saved my life.

313
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:10,538
He predicted the dragon.

314
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,802
Your own counsel, this has not seen.

315
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:14,124
He comes back.

316
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:17,912
He brought the dragon to us.
We have to kill him while we still have time.

317
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,500
In the forest!

318
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:29,675
Thanks.

319
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,450
Casualities ?
Only one.we were forced them down .

320
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:43,341
We are forced to withdraw.

321
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,631
Voltinger, we're not the enemy.

322
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:50,322
We can survive only if
we work together.

323
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:52,276
I suspect a wave of attacks , soon.

324
00:37:52,276 --> 00:37:56,196
My outposts have  seen
no such invaders.

325
00:37:57,728 --> 00:38:00,388
Did you...the fine, of these dragons?

326
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,601
You should not forget whom you are talking to.

327
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:07,542
I will never forget who you are, Sir.

328
00:38:11,065 --> 00:38:14,210
'll Follow the dragons back to their masters.

329
00:38:14,598 --> 00:38:16,098
I want to go with you.

330
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:20,073
Teach me how I can transform into a hawk
and I will follow you.

331
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:21,449
No.

332
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:24,200
You go to Linn Augin, bring Excalibur.

333
00:38:24,907 --> 00:38:26,352
Excalibur?

334
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:28,382
You must get it from a lady Vivian.

335
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:30,211
Vivian?

336
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:31,724
Nimue's sister.

337
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:33,349
How do I find her?

338
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:35,105
Go to Linn Augin.
She will find you.

339
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,605
But remember...

340
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:40,165
the gods have little in common with the
mortal men.

341
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:42,274
You must not let her...

342
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:44,466
detain you.

343
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:46,463
Now go.

344
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:48,993
I can't help here.

345
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,532
Bring Excalibur.

346
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:02,834
Prepare youself for an attack.

347
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:06,450
I would set up defensive positions
and keep out of the open.

348
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:10,090
How dare you tell me
how to run my army?

349
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:12,136
If you want to survive ,yes ..

350
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:13,972
I would dig in.

351
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:17,497
I do not think that attack
was the worstof it.

352
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:31,132
Does he know who you really are?

353
00:39:32,824 --> 00:39:33,649
No.

354
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:35,889
Wise to keep that.

355
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:38,745
Gods ..speed !

356
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:45,613
Vivian!

357
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,081
I seek...

358
00:40:53,762 --> 00:40:56,012
the Lady Vivian!

359
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:08,607
Mage sends his regards.

360
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:12,609
What we really need right now

361
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,224
is your help !

362
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:18,571
So that if you kindly show yourself !

363
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:20,466
and I should...!

364
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,594
You be  ...the Lady Vivian.

365
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,673
And you be...

366
00:41:56,415 --> 00:41:58,377
the famous Merlin.

367
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,008
Are you  not talking ?? ??

368
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:09,626
The Mage has sent me to ask you...
.. for Excalibur.

369
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,763
Yes.

370
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:17,448
I ....I give it to you ...the same offer
... I gave to Mage

371
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:21,101
I will give you something...

372
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:24,503
You must give something back to me.

373
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:29,302
What do you want?

374
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:31,857
I want to ...

375
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:36,178
what is in here.

376
00:42:45,742 --> 00:42:48,133
You are not going to find a lot .

377
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:51,034
ou don't think yourself much less .

378
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:56,247
What can learn a hell of God in me?

379
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,512
Excalibur!

380
00:43:49,532 --> 00:43:53,312
Forged in the Hiboriaan Age before ..man ...

381
00:43:53,986 --> 00:43:56,384
It can catch  the hide of a dragon.

382
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:03,936
The blades with special light,
to blind the enemies.

383
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,467
The scabbard, however simple it may be ,
has powers as well.

384
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:14,960
While  wearing  the scabbage,
one can suffer great injuries, yet...

385
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:17,717
... it will heal.

386
00:44:20,029 --> 00:44:22,129
A word of warning...

387
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:25,728
While this blade has great powers,

388
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:28,746
it is not suitable for all .

389
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,527
It rewards the virtuous, the righteous,

390
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,869
and the pure heart.

391
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:40,485
It destroys the unworthy.

392
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,644
To remove it from its scabbage,

393
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:47,191
it will reveal to you who really are .

394
00:44:49,327 --> 00:44:52,951
Excalibur will exactly .. price ,

395
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:57,122
If you are not... worthy.

396
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,162
Thank you.

397
00:45:10,896 --> 00:45:13,620
You can not keep Excalibur.

398
00:45:15,282 --> 00:45:17,763
It must be returned to me,

399
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,261
you,

400
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:23,194
shall bring it back.

401
00:46:02,419 --> 00:46:03,919
I shall take this.

402
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:12,185
I would not do that if I were you.

403
00:46:12,185 --> 00:46:13,417
Why is that ?

404
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,823
Excalibur rewads only the worthy

405
00:46:16,402 --> 00:46:18,108
... you're worthy?

406
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:21,529
The Bastard son of a whore mother...

407
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,442
and the demons from the underworld?

408
00:46:26,614 --> 00:46:28,574
.. slay with this blade

409
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:42,321
Merlin?

410
00:48:46,142 --> 00:48:47,682
What are you doing here?

411
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,350
I had a vision.

412
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,100
Vision?

413
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:54,842
Who did this?

414
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,080
Vendiger

415
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:01,651
What are you looking for?

416
00:49:02,454 --> 00:49:04,624
I fear my "Book of Secrets."

417
00:49:06,634 --> 00:49:08,241
Lost its way.

418
00:49:08,431 --> 00:49:09,608
Did you find it?

419
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:11,108
No.

420
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,200
That's good.

421
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:19,117
Where did you hide it?

422
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:54,160
So you're the Dragon Master.

423
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,403
You're losing your sense.

424
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,214
I suppose I have ...

425
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,462
I selected...

426
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,048
... such a poor candidate for schooling,

427
00:50:09,835 --> 00:50:13,055
I knew it was a risk,
to take you in ...

428
00:50:13,672 --> 00:50:15,573
knowing where you came from.

429
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,950
You...

430
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,110
... had so much promise .

431
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:29,488
But if proved to have little
talent.

432
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,327
Feel it !

433
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,391
The Book of Secrets.

434
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,700
Where is it?

435
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:41,296
That...

436
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:46,011
I invested thousands of years of knowledge...

437
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:48,851
your hands.

438
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:00,695
Feel it .

439
00:51:17,362 --> 00:51:18,862
Feel it!

440
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:52,720
Mage !

441
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:56,373
No, no, no, no!
It's lodged in my heart.

442
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,073
My time of death is now.

443
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:02,866
No.

444
00:52:03,399 --> 00:52:04,899
No, you can not!

445
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:08,145
You're the only one...

446
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,250
whom I would much trust...

447
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,010
my faith.

448
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,960
for you has always .

449
00:52:17,294 --> 00:52:19,533
You closely look like my son.

450
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,500
Listen to me...

451
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:28,496
To combat dragons...

452
00:52:29,288 --> 00:52:31,878
... it is written in the Book of Secrets.

453
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,322
You take my body  .....

454
00:52:37,626 --> 00:52:39,126
to the lake Augin.

455
00:52:40,185 --> 00:52:42,119
It will be the only way...

456
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:45,324
Lady Vivian...

457
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,371
will  show way to you .

458
00:52:49,297 --> 00:52:50,797
But remember....

459
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,940
The gods have lttle in common...

460
00:52:54,444 --> 00:52:55,944
with  mortal men...

461
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,400
It's...

462
00:53:04,754 --> 00:53:06,293
the truth.

463
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,500
Mage!

464
00:53:15,217 --> 00:53:16,717
Mage!

465
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,400
You see that?

466
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,358
Hengest.

467
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:48,467
The tables have turned.

468
00:54:48,726 --> 00:54:51,156
I, once the servant...

469
00:54:51,157 --> 00:54:53,372
'll soon become a master.

470
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,454
It is inevitable.

471
00:54:55,865 --> 00:54:57,873
It's up to you to decide...

472
00:54:57,893 --> 00:55:00,631
How painful the transition shall be.....

473
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,498
You replace the centry by the mountain side.

474
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:10,105
What is this battle plan?

475
00:56:11,144 --> 00:56:14,966
All in the open...
The men who gathered here today...

476
00:56:14,966 --> 00:56:17,976
... are the finest fighting men of Britain.

477
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:21,539
You have served me and your crown well.

478
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:26,777
Today, I ask you
one more sacrifice.

479
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,933
Lay down your arms...

480
00:56:30,953 --> 00:56:34,641
... and Hengest has guaranteed
me your survival.

481
00:56:35,623 --> 00:56:37,351
Throw down your weapons 

482
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:40,145
and walk away from this field of the battle...

483
00:56:41,734 --> 00:56:44,665
... and you will be able to return
to your farms ..

484
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,625
and villages.

485
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,527
Hengest has guaranteed that you
families ...

486
00:56:49,527 --> 00:56:52,721
will be spared if you do this.

487
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,521
If you are disobeying... you will be destroyed.

488
00:57:39,588 --> 00:57:41,236
Men of Britain.

489
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:45,499
If you lay down and walk away..
you will not be free.

490
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:49,064
Voltigan wants to take away what
he has never possessed.

491
00:57:49,477 --> 00:57:51,457
Your souls.

492
00:57:51,477 --> 00:57:54,352
If you give them today,
you will be vassals...

493
00:57:54,352 --> 00:57:56,411
... servants for a new king.

494
00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:00,278
Vortigen will certainly be rewarded...

495
00:58:00,674 --> 00:58:03,187
... for the success of your capitulation.

496
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:06,317
But you, each and every
one of you ...

497
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:08,089
who go back to your families ...

498
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:10,475
not as free men,
but slaves.

499
00:58:10,475 --> 00:58:14,745
because I was angry, these
Saxon men of not their words.

500
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,590
Do not think they will be afraid
from  attacking  your villages...

501
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,979
... slaving your children,

502
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,079
taking your women...
Look what they've done so far.

503
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,249
Imagine what they would do again...

504
00:58:27,315 --> 00:58:29,877
We will not ..go down,
without a fight.

505
00:58:30,437 --> 00:58:32,201
Are you with me?

506
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:41,189
How can we defeat their army and their
dragons?

507
00:58:41,283 --> 00:58:43,562
only offering me the brave words.

508
00:58:43,582 --> 00:58:45,542
a sure death for us all.

509
00:58:47,748 --> 00:58:50,885
Death in battle is a good death,

510
00:58:50,885 --> 00:58:52,286
and think about this...

511
00:58:52,286 --> 00:58:55,599
Though the chances are same ,
we may prevail .

512
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,259
We have more allies than you may know.

513
00:58:58,492 --> 00:59:01,895
Our people go home, many of
Saxonca 3 to 1...

514
00:59:02,223 --> 00:59:05,350
if we give it today, all hope
will be destroyed.

515
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,138
If you give it today, you lose your soul ,

516
00:59:08,456 --> 00:59:12,208
and  man without a soul is dead !!
Are you ready !!?

517
00:59:13,086 --> 00:59:14,696
Are you with me?

518
00:59:14,716 --> 00:59:17,000
Yes!

519
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,763
How dare you speak to me  this way?

520
00:59:23,763 --> 00:59:25,682
Inciting me in this direction ..

521
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:28,430
I shall execute you for treason.

522
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:31,552
No, its you  will be executed.

523
00:59:31,713 --> 00:59:35,800
You committed treason
long time ago when you killed my father.

524
00:59:36,016 --> 00:59:38,372
Umbanish Ambrosis ia an eye in your kingdom ...

525
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:43,078
.... and you have committed treason today...
... by forcing our people into slavery.

526
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:46,215
But I will avenge  this treason.

527
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,754
Voltigen!

528
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:57,520
Voltigen!

529
01:00:01,404 --> 01:00:03,401
Voltigen!

530
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,936
I told you that he would not
surrender without a fight.

531
01:00:16,936 --> 01:00:18,027
Shall I?

532
01:00:18,027 --> 01:00:21,065
Not yet. Send the infantry.

533
01:00:21,635 --> 01:00:22,733
Soldiers...

534
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:25,033
Attack!

535
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,620
Send your dragons,
Master Vendiger.

536
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:09,949
But our men are still on the battlefield.
... what about our men ?

537
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:12,086
These are now God's men, now .

538
01:01:12,858 --> 01:01:15,049
Fly, my children.
Fly.

539
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,028
He is to be taken to Avilon.

540
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:23,288
Avilon?

541
01:03:23,308 --> 01:03:24,808
Avilon.

542
01:03:25,485 --> 01:03:27,941
The resting place of the gods.

543
01:03:28,414 --> 01:03:30,079
And now...

544
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,675
from the Mage.

545
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:36,172
There are no ones that have gods as their patron.

546
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:42,853
so, those are keen, who earned his patronation,
his knowledge of the secrets of magic.

547
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,470
Which is by way the reason
I have come here.

548
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,860
That is Mage's The Book of Secrets.

549
01:03:51,603 --> 01:03:53,103
I.

550
01:04:13,463 --> 01:04:15,376
The Book of Secrets.

551
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,654
Thank you.

552
01:04:22,007 --> 01:04:23,911
You can not take it from here.

553
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,520
The Mage made me promise to do,
it never...the world of the man again.

554
01:04:30,382 --> 01:04:32,270
Whatever you need from it ,

555
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:34,829
you'll scan it here.

556
01:04:43,475 --> 01:04:46,835
But he never told me how to break the ......

557
01:04:47,558 --> 01:04:49,058
No , I .

558
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,656
Do we have new information for the troops?

559
01:05:01,656 --> 01:05:04,123
Not yet. But that  will come.

560
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,400
Word?

561
01:05:19,573 --> 01:05:21,806
Word, word, word?

562
01:05:26,018 --> 01:05:28,054
or phrase may be .

563
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,509
If you have tasks I keep you from ...

564
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:42,551
No.

565
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,030
Instead of going to spell after spell
in your mind ...

566
01:05:50,294 --> 01:05:54,060
Would not it be more helpful to them
saying them aloud?

567
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,894
Perhaps can  I hear something familiar.

568
01:06:01,075 --> 01:06:03,757
Or.... ...

569
01:06:03,777 --> 01:06:05,942
I can learn from you.

570
01:06:19,412 --> 01:06:21,987
You and your ploy have failed.

571
01:06:21,988 --> 01:06:26,188
... our army lies intact,
but my battalion  ... dead.

572
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,280
Have the Dragons moved down ?

573
01:06:28,528 --> 01:06:31,157
Yes, moved on to our families and homes.

574
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:32,879
Nobody to defend them.

575
01:06:32,879 --> 01:06:34,689
Had we listened to Vortigen's wish ...

576
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:37,790
... many men are still alive,
to fight again.

577
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:41,131
Do you know , things would have
happened if thrown down weapons...

578
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:42,951
Hengest... you'd have to live?

579
01:06:43,294 --> 01:06:45,325
He would have you butchered like dogs.

580
01:06:45,325 --> 01:06:48,335
Yet,we are butchered like dogs, Uther.

581
01:06:48,335 --> 01:06:50,071
Do you want to help?

582
01:06:50,604 --> 01:06:53,694
Everyone here is working
Take an axe.

583
01:06:54,616 --> 01:06:56,646
Your words are tiresome.

584
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:58,653
I can see no hope for you.

585
01:06:59,123 --> 01:07:00,623
You're wrong.

586
01:07:00,707 --> 01:07:03,507
As long as we still alive, there is hope.

587
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,516
And I also have hope in other,

588
01:07:07,334 --> 01:07:08,918
Soon will return.

589
01:07:08,918 --> 01:07:10,418
Who?

590
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:12,800
Merlin.

591
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,735
Merlin? He has probably fled... to another
region.

592
01:07:15,735 --> 01:07:17,765
He will not be seen here again .

593
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,540
He'll return.

594
01:07:20,416 --> 01:07:22,700
No doubt  he faces life ... in danger ....

595
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,080
do so, even now.

596
01:07:36,457 --> 01:07:39,091
Merlin, you must leave here.

597
01:07:39,693 --> 01:07:43,910
... If you do not leave ,
Lady Vivian will imprison you forever.

598
01:07:45,008 --> 01:07:46,454
Why would she do that?

599
01:07:46,454 --> 01:07:48,601
It's a cat's play for a mouse .

600
01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:53,335
... You   have count  .. interest of her.

601
01:07:54,233 --> 01:07:58,044
And the last time for you,
if the movement doesn't start .

602
01:07:59,854 --> 01:08:02,046
She gave me the Excalibur.

603
01:08:02,196 --> 01:08:04,903
And she made you to get it back, is it not?

604
01:08:06,873 --> 01:08:08,557
I can not leave now.

605
01:08:08,872 --> 01:08:12,025
Not until I get the knowledge
I seek.

606
01:08:12,025 --> 01:08:13,775
Tell her you're leaving now...

607
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:16,175
and see what reaction you must get.

608
01:08:16,984 --> 01:08:18,988
You... are a prisoner...

609
01:08:19,603 --> 01:08:23,569
... and she will kill you
once you show access to the book.

610
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:29,391
We Gods have little in common with mortal
men.

611
01:08:31,344 --> 01:08:34,341
It's... the truth.

612
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,059
<i>The Gods have little in common with mortal...</i>

613
01:08:39,219 --> 01:08:41,101
<i>men.</i>

614
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:43,696
<i>It is</i>

615
01:08:45,945 --> 01:08:47,445
<i>truth.</i>

616
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:52,277
True.

617
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:56,244
Thank you so much for...

618
01:08:58,330 --> 01:08:59,859
your help.

619
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:15,727
The truth...
Will be...

620
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:19,739
<i>In Veritas</i>

621
01:09:30,037 --> 01:09:33,509
Show me the spell
to slay a dragon.

622
01:09:54,372 --> 01:09:56,382
Any luck ?

623
01:09:59,059 --> 01:10:00,559
No.

624
01:10:01,568 --> 01:10:03,943
I think I'll give up.

625
01:10:04,903 --> 01:10:08,613
....  by  this book ,
is beyond me.

626
01:10:10,513 --> 01:10:14,433
I have to join the battle before
what all is lost.

627
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:19,292
You may leave ..
any time you like.

628
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:23,822
May I suggest you,
try a little longer.

629
01:10:24,077 --> 01:10:24,800
Think... 

630
01:10:27,304 --> 01:10:28,234
Think which you can gain...

631
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:30,571
... if you can get access to this book

632
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,800
If one drinks the blood of the dragon...

633
01:10:58,869 --> 01:11:01,109
... one can become like him.

634
01:11:08,747 --> 01:11:11,057
You're a tricky one .. Merlin

635
01:11:11,858 --> 01:11:14,805
.. pretending you had not solved the riddle

636
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:20,690
I think I'll be going now...

637
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:23,734
If you please , return me to the surface.

638
01:11:23,734 --> 01:11:27,094
You promised you'd hep me in learning ...
... the secrets of magic.

639
01:11:28,099 --> 01:11:30,339
in ... the working of nature.

640
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,340
I would love to stay and help...

641
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:36,627
but,I have to join my people
so if you please .....

642
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:38,138
You're one of us...

643
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:40,803
... we are your people, Merlin .

644
01:11:41,052 --> 01:11:43,292
I'm only half your kind.

645
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,481
and if .... you  care not for others,

646
01:11:46,481 --> 01:11:50,347
I would  cut how myself ........
to Ocean.

647
01:11:50,923 --> 01:11:52,747
Merlin,

648
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:55,292
I did not think that I will not help you.

649
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:57,957
<i>Abracadabra</i>

650
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,821
Thank you. You were right.

651
01:12:20,315 --> 01:12:22,234
Do you have the book?

652
01:12:22,736 --> 01:12:24,000
No.

653
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,917
I left in the room.
She can not access it.

654
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:29,647
I learned everything that I need
fnow.

655
01:12:30,632 --> 01:12:33,079
We need the book.

656
01:12:33,636 --> 01:12:37,346
If you kindly return
me to the surface ...

657
01:12:37,593 --> 01:12:40,153
No, you'll never leave !

658
01:12:40,525 --> 01:12:43,892
Not until you show me ..
... how to access it ?

659
01:12:47,505 --> 01:12:48,677
You Go!

660
01:13:26,715 --> 01:13:29,091
I'm sorry I did not trust you.

661
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:32,057
We shall see each other again.

662
01:13:33,263 --> 01:13:34,811
And you...

663
01:13:36,014 --> 01:13:37,950
shall make it up to me.

664
01:13:45,076 --> 01:13:47,634
I'll return it .

665
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,277
I see you've managed ...
what I expected.

666
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,187
Yes.

667
01:14:21,159 --> 01:14:24,729
The Dragon Lord and Hengest
want them ...

668
01:14:24,905 --> 01:14:26,405
... on the run.

669
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,723
Don't worry.
I have a plan.

670
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:33,828
Who is the swiftest rider?

671
01:16:23,105 --> 01:16:27,725
<i>This sword, how easy it looks, also has powers
</i>

672
01:16:28,309 --> 01:16:32,514
<i>while wearing this scabbage,
one can suffer great injuries...</i>

673
01:16:32,907 --> 01:16:35,614
<i>... yet it will heal</i>

674
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:54,856
Are you sure this spell will work?

675
01:16:54,856 --> 01:16:57,308
If you take it out of free will...

676
01:16:57,308 --> 01:17:00,108
... I can change it back ....
free will.

677
01:17:01,066 --> 01:17:03,265
What if you die in battle?

678
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:05,975
You change back into a human as well .

679
01:17:05,975 --> 01:17:08,169
..just like Vendigers dragons will do.

680
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:11,105
Only  we need are dragons keep
long enough for...

681
01:17:11,105 --> 01:17:14,000
to go and kill their masters...

682
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,610
and then the victory is ours.

683
01:17:17,028 --> 01:17:18,528
I will do it !

684
01:17:19,942 --> 01:17:21,442
and I .

685
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,393
Are you really sure ..... ?

686
01:18:09,204 --> 01:18:10,704
Definitely.

687
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,750
Merlin!

688
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:09,597
Attack!

689
01:19:19,259 --> 01:19:21,229
Reinforcements it with the archers.

690
01:19:21,848 --> 01:19:23,948
Leave this wizard to me.

691
01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:12,754
Closer will not come.


692
01:21:31,908 --> 01:21:34,569
You're not the only son of Paira.

693
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:49,699
It does not have to be like this
Merlin !

694
01:21:50,249 --> 01:21:51,749
Join me.

695
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,631
And together we can rule Britain.

696
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:56,538
Never!

697
01:21:56,538 --> 01:21:58,218
Look at the sky...

698
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:01,072
your dragons dropping like stones

699
01:22:01,218 --> 01:22:03,321
unable to defeat mine!

700
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:06,781
Tell me where is the book, Merlin.

701
01:22:07,348 --> 01:22:09,618
A quick death is better than

702
01:22:09,816 --> 01:22:12,682
.. I need to pull from your mind.

703
01:22:14,061 --> 01:22:16,791
You speak as if you've won already.

704
01:22:18,508 --> 01:22:20,244
I'll win, Merlin.

705
01:22:20,914 --> 01:22:24,414
I was always the true power behind
Hengest.

706
01:22:25,018 --> 01:22:29,034
If he falls, the Saxons will follow me.

707
01:22:29,155 --> 01:22:31,824
Its my dragons,
who inspire them .

708
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:34,668
Its my magic that will conquer Britain

709
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:37,908
and rule, as the God .. I am.

710
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:41,606
Now Merlin, you'll see the truth.

711
01:22:42,322 --> 01:22:44,299
Our birthright ...

712
01:22:44,299 --> 01:22:47,822
the power of dark gods inside us.

713
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:52,512
Merlin,
It would be wrong not to embrace it.

714
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,041
No.

715
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,960
He taught me more  important things....

716
01:23:30,121 --> 01:23:32,786
this sword can slay a wizard

717
01:23:32,786 --> 01:23:35,027
just as can any man.

718
01:24:20,226 --> 01:24:23,254
but now you will all die!

719
01:24:33,066 --> 01:24:36,986
This Britain will not die that easily.

720
01:26:09,561 --> 01:26:11,061
You're free!

721
01:26:12,332 --> 01:26:13,832
You're free!

722
01:26:16,573 --> 01:26:18,251
I can get used to it.

723
01:26:51,518 --> 01:26:53,985
See here , Uther!

724
01:26:54,518 --> 01:26:56,962
...  your new king!

725
01:27:24,637 --> 01:27:26,586
As I  knew...

726
01:27:27,457 --> 01:27:29,190
... you would return .to me

727
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,391
For today only .

728
01:27:35,752 --> 01:27:38,371
Today,

729
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:39,944
or may be a few days.

730
01:27:40,734 --> 01:27:42,774
We shall see.

731
01:28:21,775 --> 01:28:23,775
End.
