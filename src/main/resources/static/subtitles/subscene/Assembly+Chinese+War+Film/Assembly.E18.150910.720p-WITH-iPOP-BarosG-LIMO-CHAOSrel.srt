Secretary General Baek.

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,550
Hey, won't you get
rid of it quickly?

20
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,850
Hey, USB!<br>- Okay.

21
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,820
Up there. That's right. Hurry
up and take the hard disk.

22
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,440
Quickly get it wiped clean.
Hurry.<br>-Yes, I understand.

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,830
Hurry! Hurry!

24
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,910
Hello?

25
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,200
What did you say?

26
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,290
Secretary General, they say that
the investigators have arrived.

27
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,480
Please block it. If I get arrested,
I'll go to jail immediately.

28
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,160
You made the situation
like this and...

29
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,550
what is it that you
want me to do?

30
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,580
Secretary General.

31
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,910
I have no way to do
that immediately.

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,250
Secretary General.<br><i>- Secretary
General, we'll be entering.</i>

33
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,740
Because you can think on your feet,
you'll know how to handle it.

34
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,070
Secretary General...

35
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,540
What are you guys
doing right now?

36
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,468
I'm sorry, Secretary General.
We are from the.

37
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,910
Prosecutors' Office and we
ask for your cooperation.

38
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,080
Im Gyu Tae.<br>-Yes?

39
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,807
Your arrest warrant. We
are arresting you on

40
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,740
charges of defamation and
destruction of evidence.

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,750
Let's go.

42
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,290
Secretary General.

43
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,200
Why do you want to go in there? I told you
that the police will take care of it.

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Because Secretary General Baek sent
me to prison, I ought to thank him.

45
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,200
What is this? Where did everybody go?
They are not even outside.

46
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,150
What did I tell you. There
is no way they'll be here.

47
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,450
They ran because
they got scared.

48
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,740
What is the motive
for your crime?<br>-Were

49
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:31,620
you ordered by Secretary
General Baek?

50
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,200
Secretary Im, did all this happen because
of Secretary General Baek's order?

51
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,230
The Secretary General has
nothing to do with this matter.

52
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,530
With a sincere thought that a demagogue
like Assemblyman Jin must be eliminated,

53
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,250
I did everything on my own.

54
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,370
All of you move. Move.

55
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,650
Is it really true that you
did everything on your own?

56
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,600
<i>The Secretary General has
nothing to do with this matter.</i>

57
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,120

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,282

<br> (</i>Baek Do Hyeon's Chief.

59
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:26,280
(Secretary insists he
committed the crime alone.)

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,460
Yeah, right. Sincere
thought, my ass.

61
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,620
<i><br>It appears they will be looking
into who is behind the matter.</i>

62
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,720
<i>This is KBC news.</i>

63
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,960
Assemblyman Park, he is doing that hoping
that the Secretary General will save him.

64
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,050
It's because the only person he can
trust is Secretary General Baek.

65
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,600
But... if the feather
won't budge like that,

66
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,330
what's going to happen to
the main part of the body?

67
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,203
Once the feathers have
been plucked, there'll be

68
00:05:57,215 --> 00:06:00,100
countless people who would
cook it up and eat it.

69
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
What?

70
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,120
We can just wait
with a spoon ready.

71
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,990
Reporters, take a look
at the haetae statue.

72
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,910
Haetae is an imaginary creature who's
supposed to crush evil and create good.

73
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,700
What would be the reason they have
this statue in front of the Assembly?

74
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,310
Political schemes such as the one that
happened recently must be eradicated.

75
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,450
Are you saying you also think there's
someone behind this incident?

76
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,500
Every citizen knows already,

77
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,720
who the mastermind is.

78
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,160
If the investigating
authority feigns ignorance,

79
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,000
they'll have to face huge
resistance from the citizens.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,430
I demand an investigation against Gookmin
Party's Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon.

81
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,500
Im Gyu Tae is just
a mere minion.

82
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,520
At least this time we mustn't
make the mistake in which

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,160
we just pluck a feather
and let the body survive.

84
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,962
The investigating
authorities must summon.

85
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:05,960
Secretary General Baek
Do Hyeon immediately...

86
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,790
and reveal the truth behind the
scheme with crystal clarity.

87
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,660
How can something
like this happen?

88
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,010
I have nothing to do with it.

89
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,280
You can't just say you have nothing to do
with it. You have to take responsibility!

90
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,060
What do you mean,
responsibility?

91
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,940
Our party is about to take
a hit because of you.

92
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,040
Assemblywoman Park.

93
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,160
We have no more to say.

94
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,050
Make a statement regarding
this incident ASAP,

95
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,370
and decide what
you're going to do.

96
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,200
What do you mean, decide?
What are you talking about?!

97
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,450
How dare you? Do not interrupt
when the party leader's speaking!

98
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,867
Let me be clear. I can't
leave you with the task

99
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,670
of choosing nominations
in this circumstance.

100
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,980
Party Leader.

101
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,040
Please leave.

102
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,242
Yoon Jeong Soo, that person
is leader of the party

103
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:16,660
in name only but now, he
acts like a real leader.

104
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,200
I made a puppet into the
party leader and...

105
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,540
He thinks you have no
more strings to pull.

106
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,790
So meet up with VIP and get Chief
Secretary out of jail ASAP.

107
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,120
You have to save yourself too.

108
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:34,050
<i>Because you are an astute politician, you'd
better get your act together somehow.</i>

109
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,670
<i>I trust you know what to do.</i>

110
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,690
What's the matter?

111
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,180
Do Hyeon.

112
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,250
Here comes the stew.

113
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,250
Wow, it looks good!

114
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,590
Let me know if you need more.
I can make it fast.

115
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,750
How come there's just tofu? How
many tofu dishes are there?

116
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,750
They taste good. You're
being fussy for nothing.

117
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,010
You eat 'em
all, then.<br>- Yeah.

118
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,670
Aigoo, really.

119
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,180
Now that we're all gathered
together, shall we make a toast?

120
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,020
Indifferent-to-BH, fighting!

121
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,830
Fighting!

122
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,310
But Assemblywoman Hong, are you
really going to keep sitting there?

123
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,310
Did you forget the conditions for me
joining Indifferent-to-BH faction?

124
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,700
Eating at the same table with
Choi Double 0 is prohibited.

125
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,050
Just come over here. Conditions, my butt.
What are you doing?

126
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,840
Sit here.<br>- What
are you doing?

127
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,910
It's weird, you
sitting there alone.

128
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,320
Assemblyman Jin.<br>- Just come.
Come!

129
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,200
Sit next to Aide Choi. Hurry!

130
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,500
Seriously.

131
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,680
From what I heard,

132
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,690
you were a perfect couple.

133
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,080
Don't even bring it up. Remember
the old movie we watched?

134
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,950
Starsky and Hutch.
They were even better.

135
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,180
Nah. They were men.

136
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,820
Thelma and Louise.

137
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,660
Are we Chinese restaurant ad stickers?
Stop sticking it everywhere.

138
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,400
I don't want to be considered
at the same level as her.

139
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,260
Ah, bad temper.

Pardon? That's...

146
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,320
You know his number?

147
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,520
Yeah.

She called him several times, but
he doesn't answer, she says.

Look here, everyone.

151
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,660
We can't not sing on a great
day like this, right?

152
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,580
That's enough. Whose clamorous
noise do we have to hear again?

153
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,740
Stop acting like a fool
and sit down already.

♫ <i>Touch my body Body</i> ♫

182
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:53,030
I have to see VIP and tell him I have
nothing to do with this incident.

183
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,930
Secretary General Baek, let's
not become any more disgraced.

184
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,750
What did you say?

185
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:13,330
If you really are VIP's
close aide, act like one,

186
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,270
don't be a burden and
deal with it yourself.

187
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,198
<i>Because you are an astute
politician, you'd better get</i>

188
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,150
<i>your act together somehow. I
trust you know what to do.</i>

189
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,180
Have you heard the Supreme
Council will be held?<br>-Yes.

190
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,690
They're trying to push through
Secretary General Baek's dismissal.

191
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,856
Seeing the timid Party Leader Yoon
Jeong Soo's attempt at a quick

192
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:01,190
procedure and conclusion, there must
be mediation between BH and him.

193
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,290
Secretary General Baek is
now in the Nakdong River...

194
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,070
A duck egg.<br> (<i>A saying that means
someone has been totally isolated.</i>)

195
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,790
What is this? Why are you
suddenly well paired again?

196
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,710
What are you doing by standing
over there? Sit here.

197
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,750
Are you serious?

198
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,140
You are getting muscles on your ugly legs.
Sit quickly.

199
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,970
Thank you.

200
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:30,383
By the way, Secretary
General Baek seems to be

201
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:33,560
doing some tricks like
political engineering.

202
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,690
He won't docilely resign.

203
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,584
Before, when you were about
to become Secretary General,

204
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:42,350
he demanded secession of the
President from the party.

205
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,310
There is one thing that
bothers me about him.

206
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,850
What is it?

207
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,647
As one of those closest
to VIP and having the

208
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,310
most actual influence
in the ruling party,

209
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,320
the intelligence that
Secretary General Baek has!

210
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,330
The intelligence?

211
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,840
The statement that urges
Baek Do Hyeon's resignation?

212
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,970
You have to funnel the wind before
the Supreme Council meeting is held.

213
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,850
That's how that worthless person, Yoon
Jeong Soo, will get his strength.

214
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,950
I got it.

215
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,420
The eel-like punk!

216
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,070
Let me see...

217
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,510
Yes.

218
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,330
What's the occasion for this visit
to my office, <br>Secretary General?

219
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,790
I came to deliver something
to Assemblyman Kang.

220
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,910
To me? What is it?

221
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,220
Oh... What...

222
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,650
What is it?

223
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,250
<i>Assemblyman Kang Sang Ho.</i>

224
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,350
My name is listed here?

225
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,630
Do you remember President Lee
Taek Jo who gave a luxury watch

226
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,970
to Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil and raised a scandal?

227
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,150
Lee... Lee Taek Jo?

228
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,210
This is a list of the Anti-BH assemblymen
who received those luxury watches.

229
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,530
Oh, yes.

230
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,990
Deliver this to
Assemblyman Park.

231
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:29,050
Until the Supreme Council meeting ends,
do not take any action but stay still.

232
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,470
<i>Gookmin Party.</i>

233
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,010
So, did you decide?

234
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,230
Yes.<br>-You thought well.

235
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,218
Then, before the Supreme
Council meeting opens, have

236
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,060
the press conference to
announce your resignation.

237
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,910
My decision is not to do that.

238
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,308
Party Leader, I am aware that
you have a rather intimate

239
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,430
relationship with Chairman
Kim of Yoongwang Company.

240
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,350
What is the meaning
of your saying that?

241
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,520
Earlier, I know that you
and Chairman Kim went

242
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:18,850
together to Central America
for economic matters.

243
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:24,190
At that time, the amount of travel
expenses you received was...

244
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,190
Secretary General Baek.

245
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,600
This is but one of the many pieces
of information that I have.

246
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,330
If you are interested in other information
that I have, then dismiss me.

247
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,030
Today, the Supreme Council should
adopt an official position

248
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,720
that I had nothing to do
with Im Gyu Tae's case.

249
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,430
Then...

250
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
<i>Yes, Chairman?</i>

251
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,010
Connect to the BH quickly.

252
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,050
Are you saying you won't dismiss
Secretary General Baek?

253
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,450
Chairman, why are you
doing this all of sudden?

254
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,390
For now, I understand.
I'll call you back.

255
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,660
Assemblyman's
prediction was correct.

256
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Party Leader Yoon
changed his position.

257
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,150
I just said that. This prediction
came from Aide Choi's brain.

258
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,720
I see. The VIP praised her
from time to time but

259
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,890
I see that you were
worthy of the praise.

260
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,110
Anyway, because of this one
loach (bottom-dwelling,

261
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,430
(eel-like scavenger), whether
it's the party or the BH,

262
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,680
face isn't the only thing lost.

263
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,700
Secretary.

264
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,820
Please, relay this to the VIP.

265
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,030
What is this?

266
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:33,060
It's a loach recipe that the
Indifferent-to-BH faction devised.

267
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,700
Recipe.

268
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,630
<i>Gookmin Party.</i>

269
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,370
<i>Gookmin Party's 57th Supreme
Council Meeting for 2015.</i>

270
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,810
<i>Agenda: Secretary General
Baek Do Hyun's Dismissal.</i>

271
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,300
Party Leader Yoon's
not here yet.

272
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,200
He must have a lot
to think about.

273
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,690
Do you really think
you can hold out?

274
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,670
Punk, I guess he has
something he can count on.

275
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,720
Hello, Assemblyman Jo Woong Gyu.

276
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,150
It's been a long time.

277
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,190
You're suffering a lot,
Secretary General Baek.

278
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,050
Not at all.

279
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,110
What's the occasion? The main body
and Avatar rarely come together.

280
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,910
Are you here to watch?

281
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,620
I came to warn you.

282
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,080
This is a fight between
you and the leadership.

283
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,838
Don't threaten us or try
to get us involved.

284
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,620
You're not the only one
with classified info.

285
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,380
I'll keep that in mind.

286
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,910
I wish you luck.

287
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,930
Thank you.

288
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,150
Do as Assemblyman Jin says. That's
the right thing to do for the party.

289
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,790
Party Leader, they're just jumping
to conclusions by themselves.

290
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,970
Don't let them deceive you.

291
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,790
Jumping to conclusions?

292
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,840
We're aware of both of your involvement
in Party Leader Yoon's corruption.

293
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,710
What?<br>- Did the Blue House really
give such information to you?

294
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,370
Yes.

295
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,120
That's a lie. There's no way the Blue
House could've done such a thing.

296
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,090
Then, shall we head straight to the
press conference and expose the truth?

297
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,550
I have nothing to hide. Do
whatever you need to do.

298
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,750
I understand.

299
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,300
Choi In Kyung, let's go.

300
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,520
You two ladies. What's so urgent?
Wait there for a bit.

301
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,070
Party Leader.

302
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,790
Don't you understand why

303
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,020
I brought this here instead of
making this public right away?

304
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,890
Reason? Are you saying you
did this for me or what?

305
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,940
Why would I do that for you? I
don't even like you that much.

306
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,000
I did it because
I don't want to.

307
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,020
You don't want to do what?

308
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,810
I want to be a politician,

309
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,580
not someone who exposes things.

310
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,960
What... expose?

311
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,460
Yes. What I've seen the most ever
since I came to the Assembly...

312
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,240
What I saw happening so often that
I'm sick and tired... were exposés.

313
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,860
Someone did something to someone, someone
swallowed up how much from someone...

314
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,840
Exposing everything and taking
everything off and just...

315
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,080
Stabbing someone's back... and most
of them turn out to be rumors...

316
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,430
and fabrications and...
They're all like that.

317
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,430
So?

318
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,420
I've done that a
few times myself,

319
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,520
but it's not very good for mental health,
and it seems quite addictive, too.

320
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,140
But the bigger problem is that the
citizens are really sick and tired of it.

321
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,810
They're really disgusted.

322
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,880
Party Leader. Please
do as I say this time.

323
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,490
Let's not deceive the
citizens anymore, please?

What a nice sight.

326
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,026
I'm don't feel good about this.
Do you think

327
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:53,540
the Indifferent-to-BH is
cooking up something?

328
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,010
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

329
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:17,250
The Gookmin Party's 57th Supreme Council
Meeting for 2015 will now come to order.

330
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,480
Three members of the
Supreme Council submitted

331
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,290
a petition for the dismissal of
Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon.

332
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,770
I'll listen to what Secretary
General Baek has to say first.

333
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,050
First,

334
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,900
for worrying the party and the citizens
due to my chief secretary's offense,

335
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,150
I feel deeply sorry.

336
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:48,210
But since I have nothing to do with
Chief Secretary Im Gyu Tae's crime,

337
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,690
I believe I have no
reason to be dismissed.

338
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,320
He sure has a thick face.

339
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,640
If I turn out to have committed
even the slightest wrongdoing,

340
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm willing to accept any kind of
appropriate legal consequences.

341
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,630
But until then, I would like diligently to
fulfill my duty as the Secretary General.

342
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,100
I request that the Honorable
Party Leader Yoon Jeong Soo

343
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:15,080
as well as the Supreme Councilmen
make a wise decision. Thank you.

344
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,460
We'll make the final decision.

345
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,300
We will not accept the petition for
Secretary General Baek's dismissal.

346
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,050
How despicable.

347
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,170
We will present
an urgent matter.

348
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,980
Urgent matter?

349
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,990
Since I became the chairman
of the ruling party,

350
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,290
it has been more than 1 year.

351
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,855
During that time, I don't
think I fulfilled my

352
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:58,280
promise made to the
people and party members

353
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,170
to carry out public-office
innovation and reform.

354
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,702
Besides that, events up
to the case of Secretary.

355
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:08,570
General's Chief Secretary
damaging an assemblyman, etc.

356
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,520
Have mired the party in
confusion and chaos.

357
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,420
Since I fully realize the heavy
responsibility borne by a party leader,

358
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,450
I will resign

359
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,540
the position of party leader.

360
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,320
What? Resignation?

361
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,530
I, also, will do the same as
the Chairwoman of the Party.

362
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,330
I will resign too.

363
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,770
What on earth are you doing now?
Resignation?

364
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,340
Gookmin Party Regulations
Article 172:

365
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,990
If more than half of the
Supreme Council resign,

366
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,277
the organization of the
party leaders shall be

367
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:45,490
dissolved automatically.
Don't you know that?

368
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,132
Wow, he doesn't know it
yet, because he landed

369
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:50,460
in the Gookmin party
only a few days ago.

370
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,160
Then, what is Secretary
General Baek going to do?

371
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,550
The leadership of the party is dissolved
so there will be no Secretary General.

372
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,100
It will be an auto-resignation.

373
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,000
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.</i>

374
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,360
<i>Yes. President.</i>

375
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,040
<i>I watched how one
cooks the loach.</i>

376
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,570
<i>By the way, isn't
it too extreme?</i>

377
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,630
<i>Yes. It is extreme but...</i>

378
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,260
<i>I will read what my aide
wrote a short time ago.</i>

379
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,750
<i>If we are to regain the citizens'
confidence in government and the party and</i>

380
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,200
<i>if there is to be stable leadership
during the latter half of my term</i>

381
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,498
<i>it would be best for
incompetent party leaders</i>

382
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,870
<i>and Baek Do Hyeon to resign.
That is my opinion.</i>

383
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,510
<i>What are your thoughts?</i>

384
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,670
<i>My thoughts? Yes. My
thoughts are important too.</i>

385
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,210
<i>My thought is that catching only
one loach will be not enough.</i>

386
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,500
<i>After taking out all the water and catching
the rest, then we have to refill the water.</i>

387
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,920
<i>Assemblyman! Manners, be polite.</i>

388
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,330
<i>Yes. I think we have to
fill the water again.</i>

389
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,580
<i>Yes. I understand.
If you rely on us,</i>

390
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,320
<i>we will try to do it.</i>

391
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,380
<i>Yes. Goodbye, President.</i>

392
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,510
Aide Choi.

393
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,580
You, too.

394
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,660
Citizens.

395
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,240
We are sorry.

396
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,130
<i>Following the resignation of
the Gookmin Party leadership,</i>

397
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,230
<i>the party will temporarily be
run by an ad-hoc committee.</i>

398
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,890
<i>Floor Leader Choe Joon Goo, who is
acting head of the Gookmin Party,</i>

399
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,130
<i>revealed at a press briefing</i>

400
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,690
<i>that a convention to elect the
party's leadership will be held</i>

401
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,070
<i>either at the end of the regular
legislative session in December</i>

402
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,750
<i>or in January next year.</i>

403
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,446
<i>...is something
especially different. <br>Our.</i>

404
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,590
<i>Indifferent-to-BH's
position is firm.</i>

405
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,565
<i>Meanwhile, Assemblyman Baek
Do Hyeon, who is suspected of</i>

406
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:28,770
<i>suborning perjury by the President
of Hanmin International Bank,</i>

407
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,010
<i>appeared behind closed doors to
be examined by the prosecutor</i>

408
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,170
<i>and then returned home today.</i>

409
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,730
<i>It is known that Assemblyman Baek flatly
denies the allegations against him, but</i>

410
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,890
<i>the prosecution intends to carry
out an intensive investigation</i>

411
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,110
<i>by summoning him again
to confront Mr. Im.</i>

412
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,830
<i>Once called the Seo Dae Han
Administration's Crown Prince</i>

413
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,470
<i>and classified as a next-term
candidate for President,</i>

414
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,950
<i>Assemblyman Baek is on the brink
of becoming a political pariah.</i>

415
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,950
<i>Assemblyman.</i>

416
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,970
<i>You didn't go to bed?</i>

417
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,410
<i>Yes. I have something to do.</i>

418
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,790
<i>Oh.</i>

419
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:49,310
<i>You really are trying
to make something?</i>

420
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,070
<i>Yes.</i>

421
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,050
<i>But what kind of bill?</i>

422
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,250
<i>Just... I want to make a law</i>

423
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,910
<i>for the ordinary
dads of this world.</i>

424
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,350
<i>Huh?</i>

425
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,810
<i>But since I don't know what to do,
it is possible I might not make it.</i>

426
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,390
<i>I think I still won't
be able to draft it.</i>

427
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,530
Assemblyman Jin.

428
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,510
Gyu Hwan isn't showing up now.

429
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,810
But why?

430
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,290
I don't know what.

431
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,390
He didn't enroll this month.

432
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,230
Actually when you were in
jail, Aide Choi met with him.

433
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,050
Aide Choi did? <br> - Yes.

434
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,070
She asked him to come
back to your office,

435
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,370
but he refused.

436
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,210
But why?

437
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,510
Even when he hears the
"po" in "politics"

438
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,450
he told her it makes him sick.

439
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,630
What she said is, it seems he feels
remorse because you were arrested.

440
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,770
He has become more cynical.

441
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,050
Honestly, I'm concerned.

442
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,850
Okay. I understand.

443
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,130
Thank you for telling me.

444
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,950
But... Aide Choi
said you would worry

445
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,110
so I was absolutely
never to tell you.

446
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,330
If you were to say I told you...

447
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,470
But why is everyone more
afraid of her than me?

448
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,570
Just the sound of her bawling
you out terrifies you.

449
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,030
You're a hopeless wuss. A wuss!
What is so scary...

450
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,650
Oh.

451
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,490
Aide Choi.

452
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,514
Assemblyman, is is true
that the money you received

453
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:40,210
while in prison was
given to the prisoners?

454
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,250
Ah, that money?

455
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,050
Yes, I... that...

456
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,450
I bought and shared tasty side
dishes too with those around me...

457
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,450
That money would have paid the
car rent expense for a month.

458
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,330
Did you think we were in a
position to be helping others?

459
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,590
That's true. I know, but I felt sorry that
I was being released from prison first...

460
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,610
I'm sorry. I forgot that.

461
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,990
Secretary Song, what
are you doing here?

462
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:09,470
What? Ah I was... asking
for advice about life.

463
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,330
Assemblyman. Thank you
for the wise advice.

464
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,870
Yeah. Okay.

465
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,510
Ask anytime. About living life.

466
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,870
Yes.

467
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,610
What are you saying?

468
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,310
Aigoo. Life...

469
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:26,870
She's still an adolescent.
<br> What now?

470
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,630
While checking the documents
seized by the prosecutor

471
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,150
I found a file.

472
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,730
What is this?

473
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,400
It's the bill that
Secretary Kim drafted.

474
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,140
<i>A Proposed Bill Re:
A Second Chance.</i>

475
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,800
Is this everything?

476
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,200
Yes.

477
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,580
A Second Chance?

478
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,500
So random. What the heck
does "Second Chance" mean?

479
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,020
I too have never heard
of this before.

480
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,660
Hey Song. Did you do
an internet search?

481
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,960
Yes. I tried, but there
isn't anything much.

482
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,700
It's just some scribbling.

483
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,740
Because Secretary
Kim drafted it.

484
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,140
Could it have something
to do with his father?

485
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,740
I knew it! I knew it!

486
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,860
That's surprising.

487
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,440
When Hyung Dal Soo got divorced,
he lived life like a widower.

488
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,180
So isn't the bill made for people who
live alone and those who remarry?

489
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,240
What does the law
have to do with that?

490
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,760
You hook up with someone
and live together.

491
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,820
What are you up to?

492
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:58,300
Speaking of which, we also
should have a comeback together.

493
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,880
Have I even had a first?

494
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,900
Jeez. Stop making a fool of
yourself in front of the staff.

495
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,200
This feeling is a
first for me too.

496
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,340
There's something I figured out.

497
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,960
Is there?

498
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,340
I knew you were a
computer, really.

499
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,260
Secretary Kim. He wanted to make a law
about a consolation prize for losers.

500
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,000
Consolation prize?

501
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,300
<i>Just... I want to draft a bill for
the ordinary dads of this world.</i>

502
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,340
But then, how did you know what
it is by looking at the title?

503
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,140
A long time ago there was someone
similar <br>who drafted a bill like this.

504
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,020
A long time ago?

505
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,400
Yes.

506
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,420
Chief Secretary Im, has
it been really hard?

507
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,600
It's unfortunate you
are in detention.

508
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,080
I will do my best to prevent somehow
your serving a prison sentence.

509
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,080
Will you go so far as
a suspended sentence?

510
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,780
Do it as quickly as possible.

511
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,920
It would be great if it
was a minimum sentence.

512
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,700
I will claim substantial
compensation after I get out.

513
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,620
- Chief Secretary Im. <br>
- Don't forget

514
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,940
your political life...

515
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,120
depends on this.

516
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,680
<i>Let's make a
consolation prize law.</i>

517
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,780
<i>Consolation prize law?</i>

518
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,820
<i>Think about it. You have multiple
competitions in this world and</i>

519
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,780
<i>competition by necessity
has winners and losers.</i>

520
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,600
<i>When there is only a reward for the winner
without any consideration for the loser,</i>

521
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,160
<i>how far can the world go?</i>

522
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,100
<i>How do you intend to show
consideration for the losers?</i>

523
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,520
<i>By giving a belief that life is not
over after you have lost once.</i>

524
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,320
<i>How will that be done?</i>

525
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,020
<i>By giving an opportunity
to try again.</i>

526
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,800
<i>A Second Chance.</i>

528
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,210
<i>Eight years ago. Do you remember
the Second Chance Bill,</i>

529
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,330
<i>which was not submitted
to the Assembly</i>

530
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:38,900
<i><br> because the party's
policy panel opposed it?</i>

531
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,860
<i>That was your
original resolution.</i>

532
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,021
<i>I am looking forward
to seeing you admit</i>

533
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:49,700
<i><br>your past mistakes and
making a fresh start.</i>

534
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,370
Secretary Lee.

535
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,930
Please make a U-turn
at the next light.

536
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,720
Yes, Assemblyman.

537
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,720
Yes.

538
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,190
Hankook University Professor Park Young
Sam and Attorney Yoon Sun Hae seem

539
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,870
to be strong candidates to chair the
Emergency Response Commission (ERC).

540
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,850
Really?

541
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:24,360
They would be okay.

542
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,300
How did they decide to make up the
Emergency Response Commission (ERC)?

543
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,410
One from each faction and the rest will
be filled by public figures from outside.

544
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:34,420
One per faction, does that include
the Indifferent-to-BH faction?

545
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,260
Just get ready to print new
business cards for Assemblyman Jin.

546
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,320
Assemblyman.

547
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,258
Aren't you happy? An Emergency
Response Commission

548
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,360
member is at the same level
as a supreme councilman.

549
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,300
Can't you just do it,
Assemblywoman Hong?

550
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,102
But I am in the National
Election Commission's

551
00:40:56,114 --> 00:40:57,890
clutches over a political
contribution issue.

552
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,400
People will cuss me out, saying I
haven't come to my senses yet.

553
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,443
I guess you're like this
because you feel uncomfortable

554
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:05,960
about factions divvying
up the positions.

555
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,239
But this is an emergency.
You have to be

556
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:10,710
there to counterbalance
the Pro- and Anti-BH

557
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,480
and to help out the chairperson
coming from outside.

558
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,214
I really don't feel like it. The
very sound of it is unattractive,

559
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:18,850
Bidet... (Korean pronunciation
sounds like toilet seat or obese)

560
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:24,550
If you won't do this either, I
will really quit this office.

561
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,050
Why do you bring up this
unnecessary topic again?

562
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,200
I really mean it.

563
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,690
Why are you like this
again, scaring me...

564
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,620
If you're scared,
be an ERC member!

565
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,230
Ah, I got it. I will do it.

566
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,950
Really?

567
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,120
Ah, yeah...

568
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,710
You should have
done this earlier.

569
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,930
Assemblyman Jin.

570
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,890
Yes?

571
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,526
As the old saying goes,
never hang on to a

572
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:54,370
daughter-in-law or an
aide who wants to leave.

573
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,300
Should I introduce you
to a very capable aide?

574
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:03,220
Oh, well, can you do that for me?
Even better

575
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,630
if the person doesn't engage in
drunk drivel and is amiable.

576
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:12,410
That kind of person is a dime a dozen
in the Assembly Hall. The age group?

577
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,840
The younger, the better...
I guess.

578
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,245
If you are going to buy a skirt
anyway, go for the vermillion one

579
00:42:18,257 --> 00:42:20,490
(prettier, better one). Trends
cannot be ignored in politics.

580
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,803
A guy would be better. I
can go to the bathhouse

581
00:42:22,815 --> 00:42:24,950
with him and we can scrub
each other's backs.

582
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,390
Guy? Bathhouse...

583
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,550
Do it.

584
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,649
What? You want me to
step down from the.

585
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:36,400
Strategy and Finance
Committee chair position?

586
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,130
But, why are you saying
this out of the blue?

587
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,290
Just quit if I tell you to quit.

588
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:47,610
But, this old man,
has he gone senile?

589
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:52,150
Assemblyman Park, do you know
how meaty that position is?

590
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:57,380
Do you know how much I wined and dined
assemblymen to occupy that seat?

591
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,080
Assemblyman Kang.

592
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,900
You will have to take
our seat on the ERC.

593
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,590
Ah, well, ERC...

594
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,570
Emergency Response
Commission member? Me?!

595
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,610
It's about time that you
take a party position.

596
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,670
Do well.

597
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,640
Oh...

598
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,720
Assemblyman Park, thank you very much!
I will work hard!

599
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,430
Yes, work hard.

600
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,740
Yes, yes, yes.

601
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:37,700
A glory to my family.

602
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:43,090
Assemblyman Park.

603
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:52,870
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

604
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:58,220
Go to the investigating authorities
and promptly admit the charges.

605
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,700
Hiding behind an aide is not
something an old hand should do.

606
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,280
I intend to get Mr. Im Gyu
Tae out as soon as possible.

607
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,550
Do you have that kind of power
still remaining in your hands?

608
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:14,880
I will have to regain it.

609
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,630
Because one defeat does not
mean no second chance.

610
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,830
It is getting late.

611
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,990
Why don't you go back now?

612
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:28,490
Actually, I

613
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,340
have a very dangerous
item in my hands.

614
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,010
But it is also an item

615
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,740
you would covet a lot
if you were to see it.

616
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,050
What is that?

617
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:43,741
Presidential election
funds that were not

618
00:44:43,753 --> 00:44:46,650
reported to the National
Election Commission.

619
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,840
If you help me with my comeback,
I will gladly give it to you.

620
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,170
Oppa, it's me, Joo Hee.
Have you been well?

621
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,510
Yes, go on.

622
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,230
Aigo, really, so gruff. When you
answered only after one million calls.

623
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,830
Sorry. I've been a bit busy.
What's up?

624
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,965
Oppa, what are you doing tomorrow?
If you have nothing

625
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:56,890
to do, would you like to
go to a PC room with me?

626
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:01,700
Oppa, I am dying of
boredom nowadays.

627
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,470
But I have so much to do lately. I
don't have time to play with you.

628
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:09,940
Ah, really. I wouldn't ask you for this
kind of favor if only my dad lived with me.

629
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,520
Joo Hee.<br>- Huh?

630
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,280
I'm sorry but don't
call me in the future.

631
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,480
Don't text me either.

632
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,280
Um, I got it.

633
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,070
Good-bye.

634
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,290
Oppa!

635
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,110
Really just one game, okay?

636
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:47,120
Okay. Just one game. Let's go!

637
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,070
You could be a pro gamer. How can
you move your hands so fast?

638
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,760
It's because I did
martial arts, why?

639
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,800
Ah... I want to play with
you like this everyday.

640
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,360
Joo Hee.<br>- Yes?

641
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,980
I have an exam coming up soon. So
don't call me for a while, okay?

642
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,630
I understand.

643
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,980
I will leave first.

644
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,370
Uh huh. Good-bye.

645
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,620
Yes, Aide Choi.

646
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,070
Assemblyman, where are you right now?
Hurry and come back.

647
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,490
Why? Did something happen?

648
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,400
The atmosphere is ominous.

649
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,980
Assemblyman.

650
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,530
What's the matter?

651
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,200
The deputy party leader had an emergency
meeting with the floor leaders.

652
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,738
A rumor is circulating that
they are going to announce

653
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,130
the members of the Emergency
Response Commission.

654
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,000
Without consulting us, just among
themselves? Where is Assemblywoman Hong?

655
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,461
She went to the meeting
place but was refused

656
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:11,730
entrance because they
said it was private.

657
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:14,230
These people, really.

658
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,220
Assemblyman.

659
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,700
Assemblywoman, what happened?

660
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,630
We got shafted.

661
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,800
I am Assemblyman Kang
Sang Ho who has been

662
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,770
selected as a member of Gookmin Party's
Emergency Response Commission.

663
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:44,250
I will tell you the names
of the five people

664
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,830
who were finalized as
the ERC members today.

665
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,920
As members from
outside the Party,

666
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,280
former Supreme Court Justice Park
Joo Young, Professor Jo Jeong Hwa,

667
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,040
these two people were appointed.

668
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,170
And as inside members,
I, Kang Sang Ho,

669
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,580
and Assemblyman Baek
Do Hyeon were chosen.

670
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,250
What the heck is this?

671
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,360
Assemblyman! But isn't
Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon

672
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:28,780
currently being investigated
by prosecutors?

673
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,210
Oh,

674
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,440
but he is neither indicted nor

675
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,510
are his charges proven, right?

676
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:40,120
I will continue and
announce the chairperson

677
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,800
of the ERC that everyone
is curious about.

678
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,020
Until the next party
convention, the chairperson

679
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,500
who will lead our
Gookmin Party's.

680
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,320
Emergency Response
Commission is...

681
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,190
Assemblyman Park Choon Seop.

682
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,040
<i>Emergency Response Commission
Chairman Park Choon Seop.</i>

683
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,820
Assemblyman Park.

684
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,510
You seized the party leadership.
Congratulations.

685
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,540
Congratulations
on your comeback.

686
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,010
Let us work well
together in the future.

687
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,190
Please take care of me.

688
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:37,940
There definitely was a certain deal among
Baek Do Hyeon, Park Choon Seop, and the BH.

689
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,800
Cornered Baek Do Hyeon must
have offered something

690
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,462
while pushing Park Choon
Seop as the chairman

691
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:44,820
of the Emergency
Response Commission.

692
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,990
What is that?

693
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:50,130
Assemblyman Baek Do Hyeon oversaw the
affairs of the past presidential election.

694
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,490
For sure...<br>- The
election-related funds?

695
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,050
Yes, that must be it.

696
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,541
I will further analyze
the situation and come

697
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:02,110
up with a counter-strategy
as soon as possible.

698
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,900
Just let it be.

699
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,670
What?

700
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,700
No matter what foolery the Pro-
and Anti-BH factions engage in,

701
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,970
let us just do the
work that we have do.

702
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,290
Assemblyman, I understand
that you are disheartened.

703
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,620
But because of Assemblyman
Baek's power hunger,

704
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,690
the leadership of the ruling party fell
into the hands of the tired old power.

705
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,810
Are you saying we
should ignore it?

706
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,630
I'm not saying this
because I'm disheartened.

707
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:30,110
Nor am I ignoring it.

708
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:34,070
I just want to stop exchanging
blows and fighting.

709
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,350
I want to start doing
real politics.

710
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:42,150
What is the real politics
you have in mind?

711
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,610
Lawmaking.

712
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:50,950
Assemblymen are not fighters.

713
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,390
They are lawmakers.

714
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:59,541
They are elected so that
they can make good laws that

715
00:51:59,553 --> 00:52:03,870
would better the people's lives
even by a slight degree.

716
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:11,270
But look. How much remains
of the regular session now?

717
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,790
Not much.

718
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,720
Aide Choi.

719
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,660
Assemblywoman Hong.

720
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,050
No matter what foolery
other people engage in,

721
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:33,270
let us just go our way, okay?

722
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:37,650
Yes, let's.

723
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,270
Yes.

724
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,050
I was short-sighted.

725
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,570
I am sorry.

726
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,450
Gyu Hwan.

727
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:07,650
Assemblyman.

728
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:10,750
What are you doing
here right now?

729
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,370
When you should be studying,
what are you doing here?

730
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:20,510
I am doing this so I can study.

731
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,110
What?

732
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,120
Leave. The business
will be open soon.

733
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,540
Hey, did Hyung Dal Soo also know
about what a troublemaker you are?

734
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,960
Don't bring up Father.

735
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,420
I still

736
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,720
cannot laugh and talk
about him with you.

737
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,180
Leave. The owner
will be here soon.

738
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,320
Leave what, punk?

739
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,220
Call him and tell him
you're quitting.

740
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,160
And register as an intern again.

741
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,800
I won't make you work overtime, so you
can attend a night school, got it?

742
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,980
Let's go.

743
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,770
I have no thought of that.
Just leave.

744
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,270
Let's go, punk.

745
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,880
Didn't I tell you
I don't want to?

746
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,660
Listen to me, please, punk!

747
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,640
Why on earth are you
doing this to me?

748
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,240
Because I'm Bae Gyu Hwan?

749
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:32,940
Because you think you can erase your
guilt towards my father this way?

750
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:38,160
I don't need all
this almsgiving.

751
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
So just go.

752
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,460
Yes, punk, it's because
you're Bae Gyu Hwan.

753
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,740
So I want to show
you, that's why.

754
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,340
You, punk, said just the sound of
"po" in "politics" makes you retch.

755
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:57,740
So let's go. I will show
you what real politics is.

756
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,760
Stick by my side and watch.

757
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,790
Got it?

758
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:15,610
Chairman, Jin Sang Pil is giving
a news conference right now.

759
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:21,770
This fellah... did
he catch on somehow?

760
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,465
<i>Yes, I am People's Spoilsport
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, the</i>

761
00:55:27,477 --> 00:55:30,120
<i>big boss of Gookmin Party's
Indifferent-to-BH faction.</i>

762
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,740
The reason I am here today...

763
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,960
is not to expose something.

764
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,218
Nor am I here to criticize
the Pro- and Anti-BH

765
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:45,500
factions suddenly being
very buddy-buddy lately.

766
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,320
<i>My purpose for being here
today is to introduce</i>

767
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,940
a bill that I must absolutely, undoubtedly

768
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:00,220
pass during this regular
session of the Assembly.

769
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,310
What the...

770
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,610
Yes, I know.

771
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:12,090
That this kind of story is
not newsworthy, I do know.

772
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:16,670
But you have to publicize
these kinds of stories too

773
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:21,690
so that we assemblymen would
try to make even better laws.

774
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,070
It won't take much of your
time, so listen carefully

775
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:28,090
and I hope you report a lot about it.

776
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,200
Ms. Choi In Kyung, over there...

777
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:51,660
Yes, the bill I will
primarily sponsor this time

778
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:56,260
is one that allows our country
and society to support,

779
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:04,220
and to extend a helping hand
to those among our countrymen

780
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:10,161
who could not help but
fall down, despite

781
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:16,410
having done their utmost
to live diligently.

782
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:26,780
Namely, a bill to support giving a
second chance to those who have lost.

783
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:35,380
But what kind of bill name is like that?

784
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:40,300
Just by hearing it, I can
tell it's about populism.

785
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,680
All the while I was making this bill,

786
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:04,500
there was a person who did not leave
my thoughts even for one moment.

787
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:10,400
That person worked harder
than anybody else.

788
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,760
He was more conscientious
than anybody else.

789
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,780
And more than anybody else...

790
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,020
he was a really great father.

791
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:31,190
But because of just one defeat,

792
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,950
because of that defeat...

793
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,390
he was a person

794
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:43,490
who broke down so helplessly, so painfully.

795
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:51,370
If to that person, just one
more chance had been given,

796
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:59,720
no, even if he could have had a belief that
one more chance would be given to him,

797
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:06,650
in my opinion, I absolutely believe

798
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:13,230
that he would not have
climbed that tall crane.

799
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,730
That person is...

800
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,710
Even though some of you
might remember, probably

801
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:24,750
almost everyone must have
forgotten him, probably so.

802
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:28,650
The late Mr. Bae Dal Soo...

803
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,710
the laid-off worker from Korea
Shipbuilding &amp; Repairs Co.

804
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:42,470
Assemblyman...

805
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:45,670
has bet even his life on this bill.

806
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,710
If something goes wrong, that
will be your responsibility.

807
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:00,350
Yes, so for me, the real
name of this bill is...

808
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,390
Bae Dal Soo...

809
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:14,750
yes, it's Bae Dal Soo's Law.

810
