<i>All characters, party
names, and incidents</i>

00:00:04,039 --> 00:00:05,850
<i>appearing in this drama
are fictitious creations.</i>

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,740
Assemblywoman Hong
Chan Mi was pissed.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,590
How are other members reacting to
Assemblyman Jo Woong Gyu's enrollment?

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,870
The response was not good.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,290
They will like it when they see the
things happening in the future.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,120
What?

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,770
We've transferred
in the new student.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,990
Now we have to take care
of the troublemaker.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,620
Jin Sang Pil... I will
expel him from the party.

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,870
For sure.

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,090
<i>Episode 15.</i>

13
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:47,330
Gisong Island is our country's
iconic migratory bird sanctuary.

14
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,870
Every year, tens of thousands of
birds flock to the wintering grounds

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,230
and more than 30 of the world's
rarest species can be observed there.

16
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,150
What do you mean you want to
build a massive resort there?

17
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,910
Not there but next to it...

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,290
Vice Minister of Ministry
of Environment.<b>- Yes.</b>

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,248
This is an issue that is
directly related to the

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,070
raison d'être of the
Ministry of Environment.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,540
You can never endorse the
Environmental Impact Assessment.

22
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,410
Man cannot be the only species
populating the earth.

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,250
Animals have to live too and plants too.
We all have to co-exist.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,260
That way, we can achieve that
sustainable development or whatever.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,700
As Assemblywomen Cheon said, the
Ministry of Environment should

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,220
firmly intervene.

27
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,230
Yes, after a careful review...

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,140
Point of order.

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,080
"Don't endorse the Environmental
Impact Assessment."

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,930
"Intervene."

31
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,700
These are obviously and
explicitly pejorative words.

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,740
At this rate, how can the Ministry of
Environment work in a principled way

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,250
and conduct an unbiased review?

34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,160
I request your retraction
of the statements.

35
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,430
Assemblyman Jo, since when did you belong
to the ruling party to side with it?

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,620
Be ashamed of yourself.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,330
Please also retract your ad hominem
statement toward a fellow assemblyman.

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,470
I too raise a point of order.

39
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,390
Vice Minister, please come to our Gookmin
Party to do an environmental assessment.

40
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,390
Excuse me?<b>- Our party is supposedly a
newly rising migratory bird habitat.</b>

41
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,870
And supposedly we have a strange bird, too,
which thinks of itself as an assemblyman.

42
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,440
You know ornithologists? Please
bring them on your visit.

43
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,900
Please come without fail.
Please I beg you.

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,830
How can you spit out whatever
comes to your mind like that?

45
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,390
Did you see the meeting?

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,580
Assemblyman Jo is holding it in because
he has a twinge of conscience.

47
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,910
What do you think would have
happened with another assemblyman?

48
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,848
They would have raised a
ruckus about taking you

49
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,850
to a disciplinary action
or suing you for slander.

50
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,000
Would I have said such a
thing to another fellah?

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,930
It was because Jo Woong Bird
spoke too brashly like that.

52
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,100
Don't even mouth the words of Gookmin
Party being a migratory bird habitat.

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,260
You must refrain from all statements
provoking the party for the time being.

54
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,351
Why?<b>- With Assemblyman Jo's
enrollment, the ratio of the

55
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:23,150
ruling and opposition party
seats changed to 152:148.</b>

56
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,550
The swing vote, the Indifferent-to-BH
faction's sole weapon, is gone!

57
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,823
So you are saying even if I'm
kicked out of the party, the

58
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,120
majority government by the
ruling party will be maintained.

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,370
That is right.

60
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,722
Even though we look very
serene on the outside, the.

61
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:38,370
Indifferent-to-BH faction is
facing a very serious crisis.

62
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,430
Aide Choi, it seems like you
don't know much now.<b>- What?</b>

63
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,280
Why is the swing vote the
Indifferent-to-BH faction's sole weapon?

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,500
When we have secret weapons?

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,790
Flame Man, JSP.

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,700
And Aide Choi and Kids.

67
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,600
The only solution
is to recruit a new

68
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:02,040
assemblyman into the
Indifferent-to-BH faction.

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,334
Unless that person is out
of his mind, who would

70
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:06,370
want to join the
Indifferent-to-BH faction?

71
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,355
That is right, though. If they
come, it's not like some special

72
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:12,410
benefit will be waiting... was
what you were going to say, right?

73
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,316
But lately, there is a
person in the Gookmin.

74
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:19,620
Party who has lost her
grasp on reality.

75
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,670
Who?<b>- Who do you think it is?</b>

76
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,080
Madam Hong?

77
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,300
<i>Stop shoddy construction, waste of
budget, and environmental destruction!</i>

78
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,000
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
<i>Stop shoddy construction!<b>- Stop it!
Stop it!</i></b>

80
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,180
<i>Stop shoddy construction, waste of
budget, and environmental destruction!</i>

81
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,160
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

82
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,130
<i>Stop shoddy construction, waste of budget
and environmental destruction! Stop it!</i>

83
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,000
Madam Hong?

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,255
Party Leader Yoon Jeong Soo
is said to have taken umbrage

85
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,300
at Assemblyman Jin's migratory
bird habitat comment.

86
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,080
But we can't sanction him for that alone.
We may get a media whiplash that way.

87
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,890
Secretary General, how about
using the method I proposed...

88
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,950
No, that is too risky.

89
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,692
I'd like to hear your explanation
about the election of the

90
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:30,140
party chapter head in Seogyeong
City Gap Voting District.

91
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,440
Secretary Lim, you may leave.

92
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,370
Please have a seat.

93
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,290
Answer me first.<b>-
Assemblywoman Hong.</b>

94
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,150
If only you had given
me some support,

95
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,510
I would not have
lost so shamefully.

96
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,430
What is the reason
you didn't help me?

97
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,500
<i>Tell Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi to schedule
meetings with Assembly news desk chairs.</i>

98
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,160
<i>But... I can't get in touch
with Assemblywoman Hong.</i>

99
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,700
<i>I think an order has been handed
down from the Blue House.</i>

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,888
The secretary general is a
position that cannot and

101
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,620
must not interfere with any
election within the party.

102
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,000
Secretary General Baek!

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,950
Humbly accept the outcome.

104
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,390
The reason for your defeat
was not lack of my help.

105
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,110
But would it not be because you failed
to capture the party members' hearts?

106
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,739
I will cut to the chase. The
possibility of my getting next

107
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,660
year's nomination for the Seogyeong
City Gap Voting District,

108
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,910
is there any remaining?

109
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,450
No, I will revise my question.

110
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:53,540
Inside you, is there any intent
to give me a nomination?

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,900
That is enough for today.

112
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,950
I have done my best for you
for the last four years.

113
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,160
Is this how you repay me?

114
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,200
Assemblywoman Hong.

115
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,790
When you were getting pressured
by the Blue House to resign,

116
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,690
who appeared in this room
first and shielded you...

117
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,950
Have you already
forgotten about it?

118
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:32,820
You came to visit me in this room
that day in order to shield me?

119
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,750
Yes.

120
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,500
Assemblywoman Hong, you
merely got in my line.

121
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,580
What?<b>- Rather than
from Jin Sang Pil,</b>

122
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,714
it would be far easier to get
a nomination from the Baek Do.

123
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:49,820
Hyeon Secretariat. Such a
thoroughly political calculation.

124
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,290
The subject toward whom you did
your best for the last four years

125
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,420
was not Baek Do Hyeon, but a nomination.
Can you deny that?

126
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,000
For whatever term that remains, have
some faith in the voting district

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,870
and faithfully carry out your duties
as a proportional representative.

128
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,760
Just do it while I'm
telling you nicely.

129
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,420
I don't want to.<b>- Let's do it.</b>

130
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,150
I said I don't want to.<b>- Why
don't we listen and be obedient?</b>

131
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,410
You'll have to talk sense
before I will listen.

132
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,790
Why is this nonsense?

133
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,120
Go outside and ask
the secretaries...

134
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,427
whether seducing Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi to join

135
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,490
the Indifferent-to-BH
faction makes any sense.

136
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,050
But the only recruitable person right
now is Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi.

137
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,410
Still, you have to
look before you leap.

138
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,660
Just leap anywhere, when a viper is there?
You'll get snapped at, bitten!

139
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,343
Even though Assemblywoman
Hong has become too

140
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:50,050
puffed up after sudden
success at a young age,

141
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,690
originally she was a
rather sensible woman.

142
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,730
Don't just say no but
rise to the challenge.

143
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,330
Challenge what? I hate the idea.

144
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,450
Seriously!

145
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,290
Let's do it already.<b>- If you are so
desperate, you can just go and do it!</b>

146
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,290
Go and do it! Valiantly!

147
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,920
I can't do it because I'm scared. Of
getting bitten. I will never do it!

148
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,330
If you keep doing this, I will
disregard our ranks again.

149
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,540
You just try disregarding
ranks, really.

150
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,950
The last time, I overlooked it because you
were drunk, not because you were a girl.

151
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,750
And do you even know
how heavy you are...

152
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,830
Where are you going in the
middle of the conversation!

153
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,010
I have to go self-wash the car.
It's really dirty.

154
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,010
So why did you send Secretary Byeon on a
vacation, when we are dying from overwork!

155
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,370
<i>Civil Service Exam
Prep School Signs.</i>

156
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,200
Aish, really...

157
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,830
How can there be so many
civil servant schools?

158
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,450
At this rate, everyone will
become a civil servant...

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,140
Work hard.

160
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,850
Hyung, why does it takes days
for you to find one person?

161
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,250
Hyung, are you perhaps
screwing around somewhere?

162
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,080
Are you going to keep saying
those things that get to me?

163
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,310
Hey. Do you really think
Secretary Kim is around here?

164
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,530
To me, I don't think he's here.

165
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,760
He told Aide Choi by email that

166
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,100
he was with his buddies who studied
together for the police exam.

167
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,000
So, hurry up and find him. Don't
contact me until you find him. Jeez.

168
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,920
Hey, Sang Pil. Hey. Hey.

169
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,490
Why is it so hard
to find one person?

170
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,840
<i>Hong Chan Mi<b>Assemblywoman</i>.</b>

171
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,400
<i>The only person we can recruit
now is Assemblywoman Hong.</i>

172
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,390
Why are you loitering around
another assemblyman's office?

173
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,645
I wasn't loitering. Since
you are just across from

174
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,790
me, I was wondering how
you were doing and such.

175
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,820
Step aside.

176
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,800
Assemblywoman Hong.

177
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,600
I... about the committee
chairperson election,

178
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,710
I know about it.

179
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,590
So? You came to congratulate
someone when they're mourning?

180
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,450
No. That's nonsense.

181
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,130
If you are inclined,

182
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,900
in Indifferent-to-BH faction,
there is this one good position.

183
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,380
Maybe you can come
into our faction...

184
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,390
What did you say?<b>-It's not that
I am trying to belittle you.</b>

185
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,450
As for me, with sincerity...

186
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,900
If I go in, what are you
going to do for me?

187
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,500
What?

188
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,460
Are you able to give
me a nomination?

189
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,080
Come on, that would
be hard for me.

190
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,290
What about political funds?

191
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,590
What about an executive party
position or an organization?

192
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,720
All of that I can't...

193
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,180
Then, shut that mouth of yours.

194
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,150
But honestly, if you come into
the Indifferent-to-BH faction,

195
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,360
guaranteed monthly income, room and board,
things like that are impossible, but...

196
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,950
You will suffer like
a dog but...<b>-Stop!</b>

197
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,870
But since both of us are
in the same situation...

198
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,030
Stop. Stop and shut your mouth!
Shut it!

199
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,830
If you ever start talking
about frivolous things again,

200
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:06,900
then, you'll end up dying
and I'll end up dying.

201
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,470
Did you see that just now?

202
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,860
Did you see the venomous
snake ripping me to shreds?

203
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,370
You knew you couldn't get her
to join, so you made me do it.

204
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,600
I was so scared, my smile
muscles atrophied.

205
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,680
Welcome, Assemblyman Kang.

206
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,590
So, what brings you here?

207
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:48,410
A while ago, during the
Secretary General upheaval,

208
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,870
I heard that there was something promised
between you and our Assemblyman Park.

209
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,888
Are you talking about
increasing the Anti-BH

210
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,900
share to 40% in next
year's general election?

211
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,990
Yes, as it's an
important matter,

212
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,970
either a memorandum
or written promise

213
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,420
would put him at ease, he said.

214
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,460
His personality is not by
nature that meticulous.

215
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,890
But Secretary General Baek, you've
been doing a lot of backstabbing.

216
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,200
That's why he's being this way. So
you'll understand and write one, right?

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,500
Assemblyman Park, Baek Do Hyeon
asks for a little more time.

218
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,740
I guess he's afraid that he
might fall into our trap.

219
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,160
Don't worry.

220
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,990
I will punch in at his office
every day to badger him.

221
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,560
And if things don't work
out, I will just punch him.

222
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,630
Hello.

223
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,510
To what do I owe this
honor, Assemblywoman Hong?

224
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,810
I have something important
to tell you face to face.

225
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,090
Oh, yes, I understand.
Then I will see you there.

226
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,510
By Assemblywoman Hong, do
you mean Hong Chan Mi?

227
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,320
She says she has something
important to say.

228
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,460
Important my butt.

229
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,600
She got used and ditched
by Baek Do Hyeon.

230
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,400
It's obvious that she
will ask us take her in.

231
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:38,670
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

232
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,230
Secretary General.

233
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,920
Why are you here?

234
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,860
Assemblyman Park Choon Seop asked
me to relay this message to you.

235
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,240
He is having a hard time as it is to
take care of current family members.

236
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,780
He's not in a position to
accept a new family member.

237
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,460
I will overlook this
for old times' sake.

238
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,830
But you'd better be more
judicious in the future.

239
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,250
Since you brought up old times,

240
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,290
let me just ask
you one question.

241
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,160
During the last 4 years, what was
I to you, Secretary General?

242
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,700
A butler or a trainbearer?

243
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,270
If neither, a dog that
barks on command?

244
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,730
If I have to put it into
words, probably a partner.

245
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,500
Who can always be contractually terminated
if she fails to meet the profit goals.

246
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:49,160
So it was like that, after all.
When I considered you a comrade.

247
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,090
Assemblywoman Hong, a
comrade refers to a person

248
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,510
who will gladly accompany you any
time through thick and thin.

249
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,860
If it's Choi In
Kyung, then maybe.

250
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,760
So till the end, you are
talking about Choi In Kyung.

251
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,800
That word "comrade" does not
fit you, Assemblywoman Hong.

252
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,930
Secretary Baek! No, you! You
underestimated me. <b> (The

253
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:20,700
(form of "you" rather than
his name is an insult.)</b>

254
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,380
You will end up regretting this.

255
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,720
So it is a word that describes the
relationship between an act and the law.

256
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,990
Commonly, legality means...

257
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,892
Maybe it's because I know now.
He's a spitting

258
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,260
image of his father
when he was young.

259
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,490
They say becoming a civil servant is
like plucking a star out of the sky.

260
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,860
Will he do well?

261
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,450
Let's go now.

262
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,860
And not see Secretary Kim?

263
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,480
It's enough that I've
seen him doing well.

264
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,425
How can you make me work
like a dog for several

265
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:15,230
days just so that you
can see his face, huh?

266
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,490
I am sorry, Hyung.

267
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,500
<i>Could you give me some time?
Hong Chan Mi.</i>

268
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,530
Why, is Aide Choi giving
you a hard time again?

269
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,760
I was rude to you earlier.
I am sorry.

270
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,291
Aigo, well, I didn't do
anything commendable

271
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:42,450
either. Just ended
up rubbing it in...

272
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,610
I am sorry, too.

273
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,350
The reason I asked to see you

274
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,670
is to add to the Indifferent-to-BH
faction's track record.

275
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,240
Track record? What track record?

276
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,780
Just promise me one thing.

277
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,620
The information I am
about to give you now,

278
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,530
not to tell anyone that
you got it from me.

279
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,430
But at least to our Aide Choi...

280
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,600
I have to say it.

281
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,940
Then consider this
never happened.

282
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,730
You can turn back.

283
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,690
What is it, so you're like this?

284
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,680
Promise me first.

285
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,490
But I'll get into big trouble.

286
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,260
Okay, I will promise.

287
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,540
You mean it?

288
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,290
Have you been tricked all your life?
Yes, I will promise.

289
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,390
What is it?

290
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,338
<i>An allegation about
cutting up the nomination</i>

291
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,730
<i>pie along the faction
lines in Gookmin Party...</i>

292
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,410
<i>You should not have done as you wished.
You should have consulted with me first!</i>

293
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,230
<i>I can no longer
do it.<b>- Aide Choi!</i></b>

294
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,410
<i>I can't do it!<b>No way!</i></b>

295
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,190
Good morning!

296
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,530
Did you have a good vacation?

297
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:24,200
What vacation? I've come
back from studying to death.

298
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,700
Study?<b>- You must have studied
oriental paintings (GO-STOP GAME).</b>

299
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,190
Right, right.

300
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,020
The Assemblyman didn't
come up with you?

301
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,280
Assemblyman Jin is holding a press
conference in the Media Hall now.

302
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,870
What press conference?<b>- How would
I know what even you don't know?</b>

303
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,305
Pro-BH faction's Assemblyman
Baek Do Hyeon and.

304
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:46,660
Anti-BH faction's
Assemblyman Park Choon Seop

305
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,330
had a closed-door meeting during the
Secretary General's resignation scandal

306
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,611
and, in return for their
support of Assemblyman Baek.

307
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:55,700
Do Hyeon keeping the
secretary general position,

308
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,945
agreed to cut up the
nomination pie along

309
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:02,370
faction lines for the
next general election.

310
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,250
The gist was

311
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,290
to enlarge the Anti-BH's share,
which currently makes up

312
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>35% of the incumbent party
assemblymen, to 40%.</i>

313
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,760
Has Assemblyman Jin
scored another one again?

314
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,580
That is not just one score, but
it's a mega-ton nuclear bomb.

315
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,887
At this juncture when a
special committee to reform

316
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,040
the party nomination system
is actively working,

317
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,529
the leaders of these two
factions were meeting

318
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,830
behind closed doors and
colluding this way.

319
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,000
In a nutshell, this was a textbook case
of the old-school, anti-democratic,

320
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,580
backward-looking politics
that undermines democracy.

321
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,980
Wake up. The people
are watching.

322
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,660
<i>Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon
and Assemblyman Park Choon Seop,</i>

323
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,700
<i>explain yourselves before
the people right away.</i>

324
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,550
<i>That is all.</i>

325
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,120
Yes?

326
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,490
By this, what are you
trying to pull now?

327
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,990
I am in the middle
of investigating the

328
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,930
circumstances under which
this came to pass myself.

329
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:25,250
The circumstances or whatever, I am
telling you in no uncertain terms.

330
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:31,450
If this agreement was all for
naught, you won't be safe yourself.

331
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,150
Assemblyman Park, don't you think Baek
Do Hyeon passed on the information

332
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,470
to Jin Sang Pil so as not to
give us a written promise?

333
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,420
Do Hyeon, was Jin Sang
Pil's disclosure true?

334
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,050
Whether it's true or not,
put out urgent fires first.

335
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't give reporters time to exercise
their powers of imagination.

336
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,030
Make an immediate announcement
that it is baseless.

337
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,700
How come it's quiet... Is it a situation
where she's praising him for a good job?

338
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:19,150
Don't you know Aide Choi's personality?
Wait. For an explosion in no time.

339
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,990
You should have consulted
with me first!<b>- See?</b>

340
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,570
So I am apologizing to you
right now because of that.

341
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,970
Would an apology
solve this problem?

342
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,250
Don't you know what a huge
mess you created just now?

343
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,540
I know. Wouldn't I know it?

344
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,580
If I don't know that, then I
am a real psycho, a real jerk.

345
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,160
I know, but my situation was...

346
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,920
Here, Aide Choi. When
you're angry, chocolate...

347
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,410
But who ate all of this?!

348
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,630
Really people, without
telling me, seriously...

349
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,300
Please stop being angry now.

350
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,680
Okay.

351
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,360
I will stop being angry and
ask you a different question.

352
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,620
This... comes from
an informant, right?

353
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,040
Yes.<b>- Who is it?</b>

354
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,330
It has quieted down quickly.

355
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,240
Today's ending is boring.
What a pity.

356
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,250
Why don't we all
go back to work?

357
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,790
You can't tell me? Does that make any
sense?<b>- They are going at it again!</b>

358
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,580
But I told you I promised that
informant not to divulge the identity.

359
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,250
Not to other people, but
you must at least tell me.

360
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,910
Don't you trust me?<b>- I do!</b>

361
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,330
I trust you so much. If not
you, whom would I trust, huh?

362
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,500
But that is really... A
promise is a promise.

363
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,470
Hurry and tell me. I have to
know who the informant is

364
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,100
so that I can figure out if
that is reliable information,

365
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,320
and if it's reliable, the
reason behind the tip-off.

366
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,750
I'm really sorry.

367
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,270
Assemblyman!

368
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,430
I am really truly
sorry, but a promise...

369
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,560
Why don't you just hit me instead?
I'm okay, just hit me!

370
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,350
Slap me, I'm fine with it!

371
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:18,040
Do you want to give me an ass whooping?
Do it, whoop me!

372
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:25,620
Assemblyman Park, Baek Do Hyeon
held a press conference.

373
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,640
The contents?<b>- Jin Sang Pil's
statement was a total fabrication</b>

374
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,071
and an epitome of mudslinging
politics that abuses his

375
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,660
parliamentary privilege.<b> (<I>I.E.
CANNOT BE SUED FOR SLANDER)</i></b>

376
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,500
Assemblyman Park, if it
plays out like this,

377
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,890
our share of 40% is completely
out of the question now.

378
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,160
Is it Secretary General Baek?

379
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,660
Ah, Baek—.

380
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,120
Assemblyman Park, is Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil's disclosure true?

381
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,210
Have you agreed to a faction share
with Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon?

382
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,880
But reporters, Assemblyman Park
is not running away or anything.

383
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,480
So calm down and sit
down to drink some tea

384
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,170
and share some
cookies as well...

385
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,300
Secretary General Baek officially denied
it. What is the Anti-BH position?

386
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,910
Assemblyman Park, please answer.

387
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,950
This should be, in
a calm manner...

388
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,930
Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's claim is made up.

389
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:25,090
Without fail, I will ask him to bear
responsibility for this fabrication.

390
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,090
<i>Joint Announcement of Baek Do
Hyeon and Park Choon Seop:</i>

391
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:29,290
<i>"Agreement about Gookmin Party
Nominee Shares Is Fabrication!"</i>

392
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,209
Yes.<b>- How does it feel
to get beaten up by a

393
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:53,090
partner who had been
contractually terminated?</b>

394
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,640
I should rather thank you for stopping
the Anti-BH's share from getting bigger.

395
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,370
Is Assemblyman Park Choon Seop the
kind of person who'd tolerate a loss?

396
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,390
Even though not much
time remains in my term,

397
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,187
I will be able to watch
you losing the election,

398
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,950
while exchanging blows
with the Anti-BH faction.

399
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,700
Good luck.

400
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,140
Secretary General Baek, what
on earth happened here!

401
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,620
Explain yourself!

402
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,980
Are you stabbing us in
the back so as to not

403
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:30,100
to give us the written
promise, or what!

404
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,620
It was Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi.<b>- What?</b>

405
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,812
Hong Chan Mi?<b>- She holds
a grudge because of

406
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:38,310
yesterday's event and she
tipped off Assemblyman Jin.</b>

407
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,280
We don't have any interest
in that sort of thing.

408
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,450
What I want is.

409
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,940
Secretary General Baek's promise
to carry out the agreement.

410
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,700
Yes, a written promise!

411
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,390
Until you write us that promise, I won't
take even one step from here ever!

412
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:05,250
Aren't you two somehow
mistaken about the priorities?

413
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,187
What?<b>- Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil who has

414
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:09,380
dishonored the party by
spreading a false rumor</b>

415
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,120
and Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi
who fed him that false rumor!

416
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,890
I think taking appropriate measures
against those two comes first.

417
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,200
Do you intend to
drag this out again?

418
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:35,390
I'm just saying we should get rid of
weeds first to harvest better fruit.

419
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,080
What do you think?

420
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,900
Exposé politics,
obnoxious politics.

421
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:51,910
Out, Jin Sang Pil!

422
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,330
I, Park Choon Seop,
during the last 30 years

423
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,280
of my political career,
acted with rationality,

424
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,798
and I'm proud to say
that I've always kept my

425
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,120
dignity and stayed only
on the right path.

426
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,940
However, because of Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil's irresponsible exposé,

427
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,140
the pride and honor that I have
built through all these years

428
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,350
collapsed completely.

429
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,890
All this time, our party

430
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,120
has done its part with patience
and efforts at persuasion

431
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,180
in dealing with Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's perpetuation of exposé politics.

432
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,920
But we can't approve it anymore.

433
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,923
We have decided to file a
complaint with our party's.

434
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:38,780
Ethics Committee against
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

435
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,280
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil shall,
before the Ethics Committee hearing,

436
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:54,950
prove to the party and citizens that what
he exposed today was not false information.

437
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,050
If he ignores our demand,

438
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:04,250
the Ethics Committee shall remove his
name and expel him from the party.

439
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:08,610
Exposé politics, obnoxious politics.
Out, Jin Sang Pil!

440
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:19,550
Out, Jin Sang Pil!
Out, Jin Sang Pil!

441
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,740
To avoid being removed
from the party,

442
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,170
you have to prove the
credibility of your claim.

443
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,950
You'll have to tell us who the
informant was in the end.

444
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,100
That's right. Stop
being stubborn.

445
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,000
You'll get kicked
out at this rate.

446
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,520
If they want to kick
me out, let them.

447
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,130
Assemblyman.

448
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,280
Assemblyman.

449
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,480
The Ethics Committee disciplinary
hearing has been scheduled.

450
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,240
What discipline?

451
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,235
<i>Notice of the Party's
Ethics Committee.</i>

452
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:05,540
<i>Hearing.<b>Expulsion of

453
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:11,750
Wow. These people are
surely moving fast.

454
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,670
Are you still not going to
tell us who the informant is?

455
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,480
I can't help it.

456
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,940
Do you know what it means

457
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,560
to be expelled from the party?

458
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,389
It means the Indifferent-to-BH
faction, which has been

459
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:34,500
gaining much support from the
citizens, will cease to exist.

460
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,600
I still can't help it.

461
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,090
The informant definitely
belongs to Gookmin Party.

462
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,888
From this point on, log
onto the websites of

463
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,750
every single assemblyman
as well as the party,

464
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,430
and find out if anyone used
the same format as this one

465
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,430
for a press conference
statement.<b>- Yes.</b>

466
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,724
Even if the format's
different, if the statements

467
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,950
have similar text or
expressions, print them out

468
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,720
and bring them to me.

469
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,340
Understood?<b>- Yes.</b>

470
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:18,480
To stop Assemblyman from being expelled
from the party, we must find the informant.

471
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,260
Yes.

472
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,480
Assemblyman Jin, you
must keep your promise.

473
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,620
Why aren't you answering?

474
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,460
You promised you would never tell people
that I was the one who gave you the tip.

475
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,670
It's just that you asked
about the obvious.

476
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,140
Don't worry. Bye.

477
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,300
Assemblyman Jin. Assemblyman!

478
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,780
Who was that?

479
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,470
It's nothing.

480
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:08,910
What is it?

482
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,780
Ethics Committee?

483
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,360
What is it?

<i>LIST OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE:
Hong Chan Mi, Kang Sang Ho...</i>

485
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,580
Whose idea was it to put me
on the disciplinary committee

486
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,240
to judge Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil?

487
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,190
I'm not sure. Why don't you
ask the Ethics Committee?

488
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,150
I asked who!

489
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,390
It's Park Choon Seop.

490
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,840
Why did you include me in
the disciplinary committee?

491
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,400
Obviously, because what
you did was despicable.

492
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,130
Aren't you being too hasty
to decide it was me?

493
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,070
If it ever turns out

494
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:12,030
that you were Assemblyman
Jin's informant,

495
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:19,000
Secretary General and I will
issue a joint statement

496
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,700
I'm listening.

00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,710
became upset at Secretary
General for not helping her,

500
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,790
and was denied after attempting
to join the Anti-BH faction.

501
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,487
She then began to bear
a grudge, and in order

502
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:43,090
to create conflict between
the two factions,

503
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:49,080
on the condition that he
wouldn't reveal the informant,

504
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,120
she supplied Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil with false information.

505
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,100
Do you think I'll just let
you do that and do nothing?

506
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,570
I'm an attorney.

507
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,010
Look, Assemblywoman Hong.

508
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:13,890
The place we live in is not
a law court but Yeouido.

509
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,660
Turning a spokeswoman who gained popularity
with her looks alone into an idiot

510
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,480
is a piece of cake here.

511
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,640
Hello.

512
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,560
Assemblyman Park's green
tea's quite aromatic.

513
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,390
It truly is.

514
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,465
Attend the disciplinary
hearing and demand.

515
00:36:46,477 --> 00:36:50,210
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's
expulsion from the party.

516
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,870
Why do I have to do that?

517
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:57,870
If Jin Sang Pil says your name aloud, isn't
it better for you to deny it right then?

518
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,911
It would be extremely
troublesome for you if

519
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:01,930
things get out of hand
and you're not there.

520
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,040
Assemblyman Jin will never
disclose the informant.

521
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:13,580
Don't forget. Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil must be expelled.

522
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,360
Look, Assemblywoman Hong.

523
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,180
Will Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil

524
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,430
disclose the informant or not?

525
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,350
He won't.

526
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,710
Although he's incompetent,
he's a man of principle.

527
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,470
It might seem people
are different,

528
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,450
but if you look inside,
they're all the same.

529
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,366
If you like something,
others like it too, and

530
00:37:42,378 --> 00:37:44,100
if you hate something,
others hate it too.

531
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,380
If you think you might tell on
someone, others will do the same.

532
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,530
Aide Choi.

533
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:02,010
We looked everywhere but can't
find anything similar to this.

534
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,570
Secretary Sim.<b>- Yes.</b>

535
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,412
Did you check everything
from the Spokeswoman's

536
00:38:07,424 --> 00:38:09,240
office and Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi's office?

537
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,520
Yes, I compared them all.

538
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,920
Why Assemblywoman Hong
Chan Mi all of a sudden?

539
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,288
No matter how much
I think about it,

540
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,130
Assemblywoman Hong Chan
Mi is the informant.

541
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,516
To have access to such
classified information,

542
00:38:22,528 --> 00:38:24,670
the person must be one
of the assemblymen.

543
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,437
Because Assemblywoman Hong
had a falling out with.

544
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:30,450
Secretary General Baek, that
gives her motivation too.

545
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,110
What's up with him?

546
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,690
Aide.

547
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,880
About Assemblywoman Hong.<b>- Yes.</b>

548
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,380
I just received an
electronic notice.

549
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,660
She's one of the disciplinary committee
members for our Assemblyman.

550
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,360
Disciplinary committee member?

551
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,500
Then it's not her.

552
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,848
Unless she's gone crazy, would
she strike him with disciplinary

553
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,590
action when she was the one
feeding him information?

554
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:08,470
<i>Attend the disciplinary hearing and
demand Assemblyman Jin's removal.</i>

555
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
What are you doing?

556
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,100
I'm here because I
have something to say.

557
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,650
<i>If it's Choi In
Kyung, then maybe.</i>

558
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,590
<i>That word "comrade" does not
fit you, Assemblywoman Hong.</i>

559
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,280
I have nothing to hear from you.

560
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,320
Would you vote

561
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,740
against expelling
my Assemblyman?

562
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,480
What did you say?

563
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,880
Disciplinary committee member.

564
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,390
You probably became one by
Secretary General Baek's order.

565
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,150
But instead of Secretary General
Baek who has hit rock bottom,

566
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,910
I'm asking you to
choose my Assemblyman.

567
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,740
You seem to be relapsing into the symptom
of not knowing your place again.

568
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,610
Do I look like a person who will work
with someone like Assemblyman Jin?

569
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,330
About 6 years ago,

570
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,580
at a gathering of attorneys
who loved the environment,

571
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,180
when you were demonstrating for
amending the environmental acts,

572
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,410
I accompanied Secretary
General Baek there.

573
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,420
What?

574
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,020
At the place where the
demonstration took place,

575
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,900
there was a young lawyer who wrote
something on the big poster.

576
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,590
Even though she had magic marker pen
marks all over her hands and face,

577
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:53,980
she asked to shake our
hands without hesitation.

578
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,250
She was brave and passionate.

579
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,020
What are you talking
about right now?

580
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,950
I am telling you that you were
like that in the old times.

581
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,900
So?

582
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,400
You want to tell me I
have changed, huh?

583
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,990
"After a promising person
got the gold badge,

584
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,060
"she became trash." That's what
you want to ridicule me about.

585
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,020
Assemblywoman, you have not
changed nor became trash. But...

586
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,360
What about <i>But</i>?

587
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,060
Like many of the
proportional assemblymen,

588
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,520
I think you are weighed down
by the badge worn suddenly

589
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,600
without much preparation.

590
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,840
Ally yourself with
our Assemblyman.

591
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:51,050
Our Assemblyman is the person who
can bear the weight with you.

592
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,800
Get out.

593
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,630
- Assemblywoman.<b>
- Didn't you hear? Get out!</b>

594
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,450
Still, I...

595
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,680
did my best. Do you know that?

596
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,783
If anybody among the proportional
assemblymen worked harder

597
00:42:21,795 --> 00:42:24,200
than I did on Assembly activities,
ask him to step forward.

598
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,610
I admit that you worked hard
on Assembly activities.

599
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,810
But as a proportional
assemblywoman,

600
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,790
whom you represented, indeed...

601
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,200
- Can you say that with confidence? <b>
- What?</b>

602
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,830
Please check with whom you ate lunch
and dinner for the last four years.

603
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:51,100
It shows there whom
you represented.

604
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,290
This bravado...

605
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,170
In Kyung, what are you going
to do if you started a fire?

606
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,270
Aide Choi.

607
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,950
What?

608
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:24,470
I found... What?

609
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,970
The informant.

610
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,330
The informant has
to be this person.

611
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:50,960
Your reasoning?

612
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,480
There was a fact
that went unnoticed.

613
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,770
Madam Hong is the incarnate
fiend of ad lib.

614
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,420
Ad lib? <b>- Yes.</b>

615
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,840
Hence, from the statements
on the home page

616
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,280
we couldn't figure out
who was the informant.

617
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,470
Because those statements
were written by the aides.

618
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:12,430
Right? Look at this.

619
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,340
<i>The people watch us.</i>

620
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,530
Here.

621
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,400
The Assemblyman's statement
written by the informant herself.

622
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:30,640
<i>Wake up! The people
are watching!</i>

623
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,610
<i>The people are watching.</i>

624
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,610
<i>The people are watching.</i>

625
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,360
She is properly caught.
M.a.d.a.m. Hong.

626
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,780
Did I do well?

627
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,810
Yeah.

628
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,860
Praise me.

629
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,840
That was praise, wasn't it?

630
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:18,080
<i>Do you understand the meaning
of getting expelled?</i>

631
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,832
<i>It means the Indifferent-to-BH
faction, which has been</i>

632
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:23,860
<i>gaining much support from the
citizens, will cease to exist.</i>

633
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:36,610
<i>Synced & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

634
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,800
Aide Choi.

635
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:48,670
Assemblywoman Hong, who gave
the information to you,

636
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:52,380
became a member of the very disciplinary
committee that will sanction you.

637
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,040
Tell the press now. Even though
Hong Chan Mi will deny it.

638
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,610
First, break the news.

639
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,580
It's okay.<b>- Pardon?</b>

640
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,890
In order not to get
expelled from the party,

641
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,210
revealing the informant
seems so low.

642
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,160
Assemblyman.

643
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,320
Assemblywoman is going to expel
you from the party right now.

644
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,390
Is it a big deal that you don't
look low in this situation?

645
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,150
Go home now.

646
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,410
If you are not able
to do it, I will.

647
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,400
Aide Choi. Wait for a moment.
Wait.

648
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,200
It is no use even
if you stop me.

649
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,658
I can't watch Indifferent-to-BH
to disappear

650
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,030
like this. If
Indifferent-to-BH disappears,

651
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:50,220
my goal, that I will get you
re-elected, will vanish.

652
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,640
Aide Choi.

653
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,530
I, too, do this to save
Indifferent-to-BH.

654
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,370
What are you saying?

655
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:04,520
You said I can't act by
myself for Indifferent-to-BH.

656
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,780
Then, you are doing this because
of recruiting Assemblywoman Hong?

657
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:14,090
Assemblywoman Hong asked me what I can do
for her if she joins Indifferent-to-BH.

658
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,660
Nomination? I can't
offer it to her.

659
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,130
Political funds, a party position,
or an Assembly position...

660
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:26,500
I can't get her any of them.
But, when I thought about it,

661
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,120
there is one thing
I can do for her.

662
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,820
What is that?

663
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,990
Keeping the promise.
Not betraying her.

664
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:40,810
I can be trustworthy to the person
who always deceives or is deceived.

665
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:47,200
Assemblywoman Hong
almost lost her reason.

666
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,260
Do you think she would
know your intention?

667
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,573
Whether she knows or
not, if I am the leader

668
00:47:52,585 --> 00:47:54,910
of Indifferent-to-BH, I
have to act this way.

669
00:47:54,910 --> 00:48:00,940
Assemblyman. <b>-That's why you
just pretend not to know it.</b>

670
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,900
I beg of you.

671
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,400
<i>Gookmin Party</i>

672
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,790
<i>20153rd Ethics Committee.</i>

673
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,178
<i>AGENDA: Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil's Disciplinary.</i>

674
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,940
<i>Punishment of Expulsion from
the Assembly and the Party.</i>

675
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,490
Ahh, really crazy.

676
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,590
Because Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil circulated
the fabricated false information,

677
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,790
the image of the party has
fallen to the ground, right now.

678
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,540
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, do you admit
your conduct is subject to discipline?

679
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,610
No, I don't admit it.

680
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,620
I told the truth. How is it that
conduct subject to discipline?

681
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,745
Playing pat-a-cake with
the shares of nominees

682
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:44,700
between the Pro-BH
and Anti-BH factions

683
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,100
is the conduct for which
discipline should be applied.

684
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,550
Are you saying pat-a-cake? Give
proof we played pat-a-cake!

685
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,810
Huh? From whom on earth did
you receive this information?

686
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:00,500
What are you doing without answering?<b>-
Confess quickly who that person was.</b>

687
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,420
I can't answer.

688
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,670
What does it matter who
the informant was?

689
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,060
I made a promise to the
source to keep it secret.

690
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,550
Do you know you will be expelled from the
party? Do you still want not to tell?

691
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,480
No. I will not.

692
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:19,260
Assemblyman Jin, don't
make it too complicated.

693
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,650
How about resigning on your own?

694
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,540
You don't love our Gookmin
Party much, do you?

695
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,680
Yes. I love it very much.

696
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,407
Sometimes, it looks like
Balsam Institute; I feel right

697
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:30,940
at home. <b><i> (A SCHOOL IN
COMEDY SHOW GAG CONCERT ).</i></b>

698
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,210
Its environment is so pleasant that
even a migratory bird flies in.

699
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:37,420
Assemblyman, your words are
subject to discipline.

700
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,260
Assemblyman Jin, what
is your true color?

701
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,010
What do you mean what?
He is a leftist.

702
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,793
I am an onion (YANG PA) that
belongs to leftist (JOI PA) and

703
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:44,630
to rightist (WU PA). The more you
peel it, newer ones show up.

704
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:48,310
Stop playing with words. Where is
that kind of ideology in the world?

705
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,410
Yes.

706
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:56,230
If you want to hear
my ideology, I am...

707
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,960
only a human. A human.

708
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,640
Assemblyman Kang!

709
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:10,990
A human, like truly
being a human:

710
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,090
To believe one another;

711
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,090
To get along well;

712
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:19,070
Not to stab someone
else's back, please;

713
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:23,680
Not to fight each other;
Not to make someone cry;

714
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,840
To join hands

715
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,940
and to walk together...

716
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,500
that's my political idea.

717
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,050
<i>Humanism.</i>

718
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,090
Aide Choi who had worked in BH
sent a text to me just now.

719
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,210
That it is called <i>Humanism.</i>

720
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,830
Will this be the answer
to your question?

721
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,530
Excuse us during the meeting.

722
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:23,090
I came to watch here as a representative
of the assemblymen who filed a complaint.

723
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,740
This Committee thinks that we
have to take the action of.

724
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,720
Assemblyman Jin's expulsion
from the party right away.

725
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,760
I agree.<b>- I agree.</b>

726
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,880
Assemblyman Jin has to be
expelled from the party.

727
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:51,380
<i>Assemblywoman Hong

728

<i>Please check with whom you ate lunch

729
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:04,900
<i>It shows there whom
you represented.</i>

730
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:13,230
Assemblywoman Hong, what have you
been looking at continuously?

731
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,730
State your opinion of the
disciplinary punishment quickly.

732
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:22,770
<i>If I have to put it into
words, probably a partner.</i>

<i>The place we live in is not
a law court but Yeouido.</i>

<i>Turning a spokeswoman who gained popularity

736
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,800

737
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,540
Assemblywoman Hong?

738
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,460
I will tell my opinion of the
disciplinary punishment.

739
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,380
I want to take the
action of expulsion.

740
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:17,400
But the target of the action
is not Assemblyman Jin.

741
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:23,870
It must be to me, Assemblywoman
Hong, who told the truth to him.

742
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,850
Assemblywoman Hong?
Assemblywoman Hong!

743
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:37,070
Assemblyman Jin only
trusted the informant.

744
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:39,156
He had no intention to
drive the party into a

745
00:53:39,168 --> 00:53:41,540
difficult position by
circulating false information.

746
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:48,480
Therefore, there is no cause for
discipline in Assemblyman Jin's action.

747
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:57,490
If you want to bring
disciplinary action against me,

748
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:02,230
please form a disciplinary
committee at your convenience.

749
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,330
Whether the information I
supplied is true or not,

750
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:12,100
let's call that into question there,
again, Secretary General Baek.

751
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,180
Assemblyman Park,

752
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:21,640
well... shall we
proceed properly?

753
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:37,810
Avatar of Anti-BH, will you announce
the result of today's meeting?

754
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,540
From this moment

755
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:49,000
I resign from the position of
spokesperson of the Gookmin Party.

756
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,090
<i>Oh, no... Assemblywoman Hong...</i>

757
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,000
<i>Assemblywoman Hong!</i>

758
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,900
<i>Please. Assemblywoman Hong.</i>

759
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,240
Assemblywoman Hong.

760
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:13,470
You are... a fool.

761
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,510
Hello.

762
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,630
Assemblyman Jin!

763
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,860
I know. I know. So creepy!

764
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,980
It's okay. Okay.

765
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,830
Well done, Assemblyman.

766
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,380
I am sorry. I always
make you edgy.

767
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,120
I will consider it as
my fate from now on.

768
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,380
Meet Assemblywoman Hong soon.

769
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,250
Ah... Really. Where is
Assemblywoman Hong?

770
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:40,540
How... on earth...
Why on earth...

771
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,300
Long time no see.
Have you been well?

772
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,190
You are studying well?

773
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,520
Yes. Aide Choi, you've been well, right?

774
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,963
Don't even mention it. You
don't know how hard I have to

775
00:57:04,975 --> 00:57:07,300
work to raise a kid who is
not supposed to be my fate.

776
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,520
I saw the news. He was almost
expelled from the party.

777
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,220
He had a close call.

778
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,180
Assemblyman might have saved the
country in his previous life.

779
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,900
It's because you are by his side.

780
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,140
When you two team up, no one can match you.

781
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:25,400
By the way, how is it going
with the bill you were making?

782
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,210
I stopped making it. It looks like I
don't yet have the ability to make it.

783
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,050
Try to send it to me although it's not
finished. I will check it for you.

784
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:36,650
That's okay. If you read it,
it will only hurt your eyes.

785
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,720
Next time, just call me
with your cellphone.

786
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,150
I won't tell Assemblyman. What
is this, like a criminal?

787
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:44,650
Yes.

788
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,770
Anyhow, Aide Choi, cheer up.

789
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:49,980
Okay. Thank you.

790
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,880
Aide Choi.

791
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,820
What are you doing?

792
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:12,020
It seems Assemblywoman Hong
hasn't come to work today either.

793
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,678
Did you think she would
come to work in the middle

794
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,360
of a rumor about her
resignation from the Assembly?

795
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,600
She doesn't answer the phone.

796
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,830
Will she really resign?

797
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,830
Hello?<b>-<i>Kim Gyu Hwan?</i></b>

798
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:34,410

What is the question you want to ask?

802
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:00,550
Yes.

803
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,510
There is a case that we are
investigating secretly.

804
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:04,680
Secret investigation?

805
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,360
Do you know Hanmin Bank?

806
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,770
Hanmin Bank?

807
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:11,970
You received a shopping bag with money in
it from the bank presiden't secretary.

808
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:15,110
And delivered it to Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil, right?

809
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,380
If... I mean if...

810
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:33,220
If you have not received the
money back from Assemblyman Jin,

811

will get a punishment, but</i>

compared to the punishment
for the illegal loan

816
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:09,530
