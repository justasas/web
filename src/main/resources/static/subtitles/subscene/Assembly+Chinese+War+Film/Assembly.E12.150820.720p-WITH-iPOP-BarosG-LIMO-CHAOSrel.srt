5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,520
I'm visiting my father for a while
because today is his birthday.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,720
Is that so? Okay.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,310
Come on up after you
show him a lot of love.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,270
Yes. See you tomorrow.

9
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,230
<i>Resume.</i>

10
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,520
<i>Kim Gyu Hwan.</i>

11
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,980
<i>Because there was something I wanted
to do in the national assembly.</i>

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
<i>What kind of work?
Become an assemblyman?</i>

13
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:37,270
<i>No, I want to become a trustworthy
staff member of an assemblyman.</i>

14
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:43,010
<i>So Secretary Kim, instead of wearing
it himself, tried to give this to me?</i>

15
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,140
<i>Yes, that's what I said.</i>

16
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,670
<i>I thought he was only good at martial arts,
but he has a good human character as well.</i>

17
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,330
Why are you here already? I thought
it was your father's birthday.

18
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,400
I just went there to see
his face, that's why.

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,260
I see.

20
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,700
Why didn't you get
off work, Aide?

21
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,370
I am making a manual for bill drafting.
There is the Assembly's manual, but...

22
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,130
It seemed like it was
a bit hard for you.

23
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,520
You really didn't have
to go to that extent.

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,040
Just make a good bill. If it's crummy,
I will totally look down on you.

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,140
Yep, I understand.

26
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,150
Assemblyman.

27
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,130
I came back.

28
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,890
Did I do something wrong?

29
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,060
Secretary Kim went to Busan because
today is his father's birthday.

30
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,700
He went there to pay
his respects today.

31
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,240
Okay.

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,480
Okay.

33
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,480
You did well to do that.

34
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,800
You did well.

35
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,340
I'll be out for a while.
Out for a while.

36
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,900
Assemblyman, I tell you,

37
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,570
he sure does have a way of
complimenting with sincerity, right?

38
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,490
<i>President Seo Dae
Han, this morning,</i>

39
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,204
<i>designated Joo Cheol Soon, the head of
the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure</i>

40
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:07,440
<i>and Transport (MOLIT), as the new
prime ministerial candidate.</i>

41
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,814
<i>Prime Minister-designate Joo Cheol
Soon served on the Economic Planning.</i>

42
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:11,880
<i>Board and as a Ministry of
Construction and Transport official</i>

43
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,198
<i>prior to becoming the
MoLIT minister. His</i>

44
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,730
<i>background is entirely in
public administration.</i>

45
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,520
<i>He is reputed to be a figure with both
the necessary expertise and drive.</i>

46
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,236
<i>The Blue House has
stated that Prime.</i>

47
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:22,770
<i>Minister-designate Joo is the
most qualified candidate</i>

48
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,268
<i>who can overcome the pressing
issue of a depressed</i>

49
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,820
<i>economy and that is the
reason behind his selection.</i>

50
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,266
<i>The Assembly is planning to hold
a confirmation hearing as soon</i>

51
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:30,620
<i>as the prime ministerial candidate
appointment motion is made</i>

52
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,880
<i>and proceed with the
ratification process.</i>

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,240
The arrogance of the
Administration knows no bounds.

54
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,564
Prime Minister-designate Joo, at the
time of his confirmation hearing as the.

55
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:40,730
Minister of the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT),

56
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,240
caused all sorts of scandals due to
various alleged corrupt practices.

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,420
Can a person like this be the
Prime Minister-designate?

58
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,240
This is an appointment that
disregards the people's wish.

59
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,971
The nomination is an
admission by the Seo Dae Han.

60
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:59,330
Administration of the dearth of
competent people in its camp.

61
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,100
The people are no longer
hopeful or moved.

62
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,690
We urge President Seo Dae Han.

63
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,141
You cannot find a breakthrough
in these difficult

64
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,370
times simply by switching
the Prime Minister.

65
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,260
Great compromise arrived at
after an inter-party summit,

66
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,460
which has been consistently demanded
by the Korean Democratic Party,

67
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,370
is the sole way to revive the
country and its economy.

68
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,340
Please bear that in mind.

69
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,110
What?

70
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,270
Even if there is no competent person,
how can somebody like Joo Cheol Soon...

71
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,150
Secretary General, why didn't
you try to stop the VIP?

72
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,150
He is becoming more obstinate.

73
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,330
And those around him are
just agreeing with him.

74
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,603
Setting the Administration's
approval rate

75
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:48,060
aside, the party's approval
rate will plummet.

76
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,630
At this rate, can we win the
next round of elections?

77
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,410
Even so, what can we do?

78
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,530
The decision has
already been made and

79
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,980
we are the people who have
to implement his decision.

80
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,500
We have to ensure that the Prime
Minister's appointment is confirmed.

81
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,840
What do you guys think?

82
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,680
No, don't get up.

83
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,330
That Minister Joo Cheol Soon, is
he prime minister material or not?

84
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,400
His nickname is Bulldozer and he has a
reputation for being a good worker.

85
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,390
But his moral compass suffers
from many shortcomings.

86
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,635
From the opposition
parties' press conference

87
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:28,100
earlier, he seemed like a
very problematic figure.

88
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,562
When he was appointed to the
MoLIT minister position,

89
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:30,830
didn't he go through any
confirmation hearing?

90
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,430
Of course he did. Why
wouldn't he have?

91
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,420
But did they just let a person
like that become a minister?

92
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,050
The opposition parties objected like hell,
but it was all just swept away later.

93
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,900
Why?

94
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,680
Even if assemblymen object, ministers
are just appointed by the President.

95
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,440
Then, why do they hold
confirmation hearings?

96
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,181
There is that positive aspect of
the Assembly getting to examine

97
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,650
the character and expertise of
candidates for high office.

98
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,128
Once in a while, a problem
is revealed during the

99
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,780
hearing process and the
candidate voluntarily withdraws

100
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,100
or the President revokes
the appointment.

101
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,460
Aide Choi.

102
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,900
Yes, Assemblyman.

103
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,430
I don't like that person Joo Cheol Soon.
Let's do that thing, okay?

104
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,170
A Confirmation
Hearing Committee.

105
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,400
A Confirmation
Hearing Committee?

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,760
Yes, let me just send him
away for good this time.

107
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,850
Why?

108
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,530
Assemblyman.<br>-
Huh?<br>- Here...

109
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,250
Yes, what is it?

110
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,660
<i>Notice.</i>

112
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,440

<i>PARK CHOON SEOP; MEMBERS:
Hong Chan Mi, Kang Sang Ho...</i>

115
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,230
Have they already come up with
the scenario among themselves?

116
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,480
Unless the party leadership
is out of their minds,

117
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,020
would they include the big boss
of the Indifferent-to-BH faction?

118
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,817
These people really... After
suffering at the hands

119
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,530
of our Indifferent-to-BH
faction so much, still...

120
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,430
Are they looking
down on us, huh?

121
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,895
Oath. I, a candidate for
high office, pledge, in the

122
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,990
confirmation hearing
undertaken by the country,

123
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,713
that I will follow my
conscience and, without any

124
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:05,310
addition or omission, will
tell the whole truth.

125

<i>Special Committee for the
Confirmation Hearing</i>

126
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:10,440
<i>of the Prime Minister-Designate
Joo Cheol Soon.</i>

127
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,472
Plagiarism in your
doctoral dissertation, a

128
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:22,380
massive profit from a
real estate transaction

129
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,492
that would put real
estate speculators to

130
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,880
shame, dubious exemption
from military service,

131
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,350
showering a certain company with
all the subcontracting jobs!

132
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,150
Do you think a person like this deserves
to be a country's prime minister?

133
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,040
Assemblyman Jo! Aren't you
tired of rebroadcasting?

134
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,842
Those stories all
came out during the

135
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:41,050
ministerial confirmation
hearing, didn't they?

136
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,510
If there is a problem, it should be rerun
not just once, but twice or three times!

137
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,020
Is there any allegation, voiced at
that time, that turned out to be true?

138
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,737
Let's stop mud-slinging and
just discuss whether he has

139
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:53,430
what it takes to carry out
the Prime Minister's duties.

140
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,416
Well said. Among the qualities
of a high government official,

141
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:59,040
is there anything more important
than the moral fiber?

142
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,990
Now, now, that is enough.

143
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,005
It seems as though the
designate did not apologize

144
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:06,780
enough in the last
confirmation hearing.

145
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,323
Since it's all water under
the bridge, speaking of

146
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:11,790
the devil, why don't you
apologize one more time?

147
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,380
<i>Back then and even now,
I feel much remorse</i>

148
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,500
<i>that such allegations
were made against me.</i>

149
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,890
But what Assemblyman Jo Woong Gyu is
saying, are those just allegations?

150
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,370
There is no smoke
without any fire.

151
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,490
<i>I think those are not
allegations but...</i>

152
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,940
Wow, if those are true, really,

153
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,200
he is a total
scumbag, that person.

154
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,930
Tax delinquency of all sorts
including the income taxes.

155
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,270
Registration of a false address to send
your son to a good school district.

156
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,678
Entering into a so-called "down
contract" to falsify and

157
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,750
reduce the purchase price
for smaller tax payments!

158
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,460
I have a statement to make in connection
with the progress of the meeting.

159
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,090
I am in the middle of
asking a question!<br>- Chairman!

160
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,150
Um, Assemblywoman Cheon, I
will give you more time later.

161
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,990
Let's listen to what
Assemblywoman Hong has to say.

162
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,869
This is the transcript from the
Prime Minister-designate's

163
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,220
past ministerial
confirmation hearing.

164
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,181
How can the questions
be exactly same without

165
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:19,520
even any changes in
the punctuation?

166
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,980
I will read back to you the
candidate's answer from that time.

167
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,720
Tax delinquency was by a
mistake and not deliberate.

168
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,836
Registration of a false address
and the down contract were

169
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:34,120
wrongs committed by me because
they were customary at the time.

170
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,500
I deeply regret them and feel
a keen sense of remorse.

171
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,940
Please come up with something
new if you can do so.

172
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,400
That's right.

173
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,100
Let's stop reruns and
turn to the main feature.

174
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't even watch drama reruns
because they are boring.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,900
My respected Assemblywoman
Cheon No Shim.

176
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,991
Please question him
concerning any alleged wrong

177
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:01,980
committed since he took
the office of minister.

178
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
He's really the incarnation
of corruption.

179
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,940
He's all sorts of crookedness
mixed in a bowl.

180
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,245
He's a bibimbap of corruption.
Aigo, that

181
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:18,740
person won't be able to
pass at the Assembly.

182
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,000
No, the appointment
motion will be passed.

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,280
What? How come?

184
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,127
As you've seen on TV, they
were all stories that came

185
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,680
out during the ministerial
confirmation hearing.

186
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,294
Unless something new is
found, the opposition party

187
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:34,680
will have a hard time
opposing the appointment.

188
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,360
Then, I have to go along with
appointing that kind of a person?

189
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,720
No.<br>-Then, what? Abstention?

190
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,780
No.<br>-Then, what is it?

191
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,980
Evasion.<br>- Evasion?

192
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,340
What brings you here?

193
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,860
Because I was curious about
your party's position.

194
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,808
The Socialist Party
seems to be thinking of

195
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,780
vetoing the appointment
motion as one party.

196
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,080
Since they only have a few assemblymen,
they can easily unify their opinion.

197
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,420
But we have too many self-important
people, so it won't be easy.

198
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,360
Just leave it up to each
assemblyman's will.

199
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,420
Joo Cheol Soon. He already went through a
confirmation hearing to be a minister.

200
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,501
A ministerial appointment
doesn't have to be

201
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,700
confirmed, so we just
went through the motions.

202
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,160
But the Prime Minister
is a different matter.

203
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,126
If you oppose now, you
will only be acknowledging

204
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:23,640
the dereliction of your
duty at that time.

205
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,200
You'll just become
a laughing stock.

206
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,829
Now, I'm feeling hot
under the collar. I'd

207
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,520
better push objection
as our party position.

208
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,180
Your Korean Democratic Party has
as many as 139 assemblymen.

209
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,440
The appointment motion will
be put to a secret vote.

210
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,979
Is there any guarantee that
no aberrant vote will result

211
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,460
even if objection becomes the
official party position?

212
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,160
There isn't. But if a wayward
vote or two results in our loss,

213
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,933
the Korean Democratic Party will
also fall to the lows of the Garden.

214
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:50,600
Balsam School Party (GOOKMIN PARTY'S
NICKNAME AS CALLED BY JSP).

215
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,340
Don't overtax yourselves
to defeat him.

216
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,900
Just find an acceptable
way to avoid fighting.

217
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,940
So what is the bottom line
of all this Ahjussi's talk?

218
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:06,160
The person who leads a good honest
life is the best kind of person.

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,249
No matter how good a
student you are, if your

220
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:10,500
personality sucks, you
can't function in society.

221
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,740
And you can't be a good
person, understand?

222
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,880
Okay...

223
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,860
Hmm, I don't think the
response is that great.

224
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,360
Right. Does he think kids
nowadays like this kind of talk?

225
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,700
Why are you guys making so much noise
over there? Gyu Hwan, be quiet!

226
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,528
Aigoo, look at the time.
I entertained you so

227
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,380
much with my talk so time
just flew by, right?

228
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,878
So in the future, you know
those kids whose grades

229
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,400
are not that good or who
are not from rich homes...

230
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,940
you should not be
mean to those kids.

231
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,192
You know that thing much talked about
nowadays... snack shuttles (kids

232
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:46,500
(bullied into running chores for bullies
such as buying snacks for them).

233
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,080
I like pastry, but
things like that...

234
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,380
outcasting, things like this, you
should never engage in those things.

235
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,160
Then you cannot become a good person. But
we need to become good people, right?

236
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,200
When we grow up, becoming what
will make us good people?

237
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,920
An assemblyman
like you, Ahjussi?

238
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,980
Well, it's not like I am
boasting or anything, but

239
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,140
becoming an assemblyman
can also make you good.

240
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:18,620
My dad said all
politicians are thieves.

241
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:26,660
Aigo, no, it's okay. She can be right.
It's not totally wrong to say so.

242
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,160
But, do I look like a thief?

243
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,380
Aigo, it's already over.

244
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,940
At any rate, it was so nice to
meet you all today and next time,

245
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,380
I will return with fun stories.

246
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,500
Okay, it was nice meeting you. Be close
friends with Joo Hee and don't fight.

247
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:58,360
<i>My dad said all
politicians are thieves.</i>

248
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,260
Is something the matter? You
don't have a happy face.

249
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,780
No, nothing.

250
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,620
Aigoo, Assemblyman Jin!
Nice to meet you.

251
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,340
Oh, yes, how are you?

252
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,240
Please help me with the appointment motion.
I will count on you.

253
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,680
But what are the things said
during the confirmation hearing?

254
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,640
Assemblyman Jin.

255
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,420
Why? Can't I ask him?

256
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,137
Confirmation hearings
have long deteriorated

257
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:30,340
into mud-slinging fight arenas.

258
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,740
The opposition parties are just
trying to stick it to him.

259
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,960
But there are things that
turned out to be true.

260
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,280
That registration of a false address and
what was that, oh, the down contract.

261
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,460
Assemblyman Jin.

262
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,560
Yes?

263
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,260
Those were customary
at that time.

264
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,380
I was trying to lead a diligent
life and those things happened.

265
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,020
Please graciously overlook it.

266
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,440
Let's go, Minister.

267
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,080
Assemblyman Jin.

268
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,746
It will be better for you
to keep silent about

269
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:12,180
the ratification of
the Prime Minister.

270
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,080
Are you trying to intimidate me?

271
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,777
When I made a declaration
of indifference, I

272
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,460
clearly told you that I
wouldn't get scared.

273
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,500
Not just I, but the Blue House is
watching you too, Assemblyman Jin.

274
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,112
Oh, is that so? Please go
and tell that high and

275
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:30,600
mighty person that it is
an honor to my family.

276
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,500
Bastard.

277
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,500
This is just too much.

278
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,020
They've all plotted
together, together.

279
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,480
Everyone, give me
your attention.

280
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,020
Let us try this, huh?

281
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,900
Try... what?

282
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,660
A way to make the Prime
Minister-designate fail the confirmation.

283
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,360
We can just find his wrongdoings
since he became a minister.

284
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,380
Right? Let's try this.

285
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,539
The Indifferent-to-BH
faction's exclusive

286
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,240
confirmation hearing. What
do you think, Aide Choi?

287
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,560
But, Assemblyman, the opposition parties
have already rummaged through everything.

288
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,866
What?<br>- That's why the
opposition parties

289
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:29,900
are resorting to reruns
of the old stuff.

290
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,760
So?<br>- What?

291
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,740
So, then, should we just
watch such a human being

292
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,580
becoming the Prime Minister
and acting all stuck-up?

293
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,860
No, that's not what
I'm saying but...

294
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,078
We don't have the prosecutors'
right to investigate nor

295
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,280
are you a member of the
confirmation hearing committee.

296
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,080
There is no way the candidate will
just hand over information to us.

297
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,820
Is that what all of you think?

298
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,140
I guess you over there of course think so.
Secretary Song, do you also think so?

299
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,140
Hyung Seong Gi, Secretary
Oh, how about you guys?

300
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,560
What you say is right but...

301
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,990
Why get so heated about something
like that? No matter who

302
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,320
becomes the Prime Minister,
it's the same old, same old.

303
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,140
But, Da Jeong and Secretary
Kim, do you think so too?

304
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,100
Assemblyman.

305
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,060
As of now, we don't
have any way.

306
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,820
Ah, I see. Yes.

307
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,620
We don't have any way, huh?

308
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,403
I was the only one
who didn't know when

309
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:37,560
everybody else knew about
there being no way.

310
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,680
I am sorry. I was being the
only wet blanket around here.

311
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,440
What will happen to the
country at this rate?

312
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,980
A thief like Joo Cheol Soon
is the Prime Minister?

313
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,060
That's what I'm saying!<br>- This blasted
country. I should just up and emigrate.

314
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,780
Why?
<br>- I am here to take you home.

315
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Drink one shot.

316
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,820
Aunt, give me a glass here.

317
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,420
Okay.

318
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,200
I... understand how you feel.

319
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,110
Such a person ought not
become the Prime Minister.

320
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,560
So that's why people
curse at politicians.

321
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,660
<i>If a guy like me crawls out there and asks
for votes, who's going to vote for him?</i>

322
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,480
<i>Got divorced by a cheating
wife and his only son...</i>

323
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,100
<i>To keep him from being called a cripple's
son, if he gave up his parental rights...</i>

324
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,100
<i>When told this, who in the
world will vote for me?</i>

325
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,700
<i>It's about Hyung Dal Soo.</i>

326
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,300
<i>What he really wants...</i>

327
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,260
<i>do you know, Assemblyman?</i>

328
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,120
<i>Why do you want to know?</i>

329
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,150
<i>Please tell me.</i>

330
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,850
Gyu Hwan... Yes.

331
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,520
Assemblyman.

332
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,940
I am sorry.

333
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,080
It's not something you
should be sorry about.

334
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,560
Still, I'm sorry.

335
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:55,460
The Assemblyman seems
to be very upset.

336
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,660
This is all because the
opposition parties are worthless.

337
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,900
Just lock the main
hall doors and

338
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,360
spread out their bedding there.
That should end the matter.

339
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,320
In the old days, countering
rush-throughs and what nots,

340
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,220
the opposition parties used to stage lie-in
protests and engage in physical fights.

341
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,600
But nowadays the law has been
changed and no such thing exists.

342
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,980
How did the law change
so it's like that?

343
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,060
That is a long story.

344
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,010
<i>Aicham.</i><br> - Oh!

345
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,850
That is right, that's it!

346
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,910
<i>Constitution and Assembly-related
Law and Regulations.</i>

347
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,440
<i>Article 106-2 Holding
Unlimited Debate, Etc.</i>

348
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,738
<i>...when a conforming
request is submitted,</i>

349
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,060
<i>an unlimited debate can
be held, provided...</i>

350
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,140
Why didn't I think
of this earlier?

351
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,870
But, anyway,

352
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,987
how can a person change
so much just because he

353
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,950
was named as a candidate
for Prime Minister?

354
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,512
From the time he was a minister,
the back bending angle

355
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,730
itself is different (MUCH
MORE STIFF, STUCK-UP).

356
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,570
He belongs to the old school.

357
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,800
Even now, he probably thinks
digging up the ground

358
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,900
and erecting buildings are
all there is to politics.

359
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,733
Looking at that, I realize
what poor judgment the.

360
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:12,480
VIP has when it comes to
selecting his cabinet.

361
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,600
If I were him, I would pick you
for the Prime Minister's post.

362
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,980
Setting aside the prime
ministerial position,

363
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,520
nowadays I feel like I've
become the BH's hatchetman.

364
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,360
Yes, what's up?<br>- What
do you mean what's up...

365
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,177
I found a way to clean
up the pile of sh*t

366
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:36,060
you guys made and want
to tell you about it.

367
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,960
It's so predictable. You're
boycotting the main session, right?

368
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,840
No way in hell.

369
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,040
I've gotten one hundred
assemblymen's seals.

370
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,988
For filibustering.<br>(Filibuster.
An extended

371
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,940
<i>( debate which delays or
even may prevent voting )</i>

372
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,900
What did you say?

373
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,040
Tell your assemblymen to bring their
sleeping bags to the session.

374
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,530
How was I?

375
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,090
Sunbae-nim... You are so cool.

376
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,210
What a cutie you are.

377
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,180
Um, what? Fili... what?
What-ster?

378
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,060
A filibuster means a
lawful obstruction

379
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,240
of progress in a
legislative assembly.

380
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,620
It was repealed for a long time and then
brought back to life a few years ago.

381
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,620
Under the name of unlimited
debate during the session.

382
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,240
If unlimited, can one person
go on for hours by himself?

383
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,560
If he can continue his statement
without leaving the lectern,

384
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,960
not a few hours but even
a few days will be okay.

385
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
Aigo, Aide Choi, how can
you talk such nonsense...

386
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,200
How can a person do that? At the
most, it will be 3-4 hours.

387
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,100
But, anyway, why are you suddenly
talking about that fili thing?

388
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,370
Aigo, what do they
mean by a filibuster?

389
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,470
Do they think we are in the US?

390
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,890
Since the vote won't
bring them a victory,

391
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,990
they are at least trying
to delay the vote.

392
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:00,530
Still, it's not such
a simple matter.

393
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,950
The special session ends
in 2 days, 48 hours.

394
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,030
But if those 100 bastards
blabber for 1 hour each,

395
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,840
that works out to 100 hours.

396
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,630
While listening to those
bastards, the special session

397
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:17,960
will come to an end without
much to show for it.

398
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,680
That is what they
are aiming for.

399
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,834
Not passing it in this
Assembly but dragging

400
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:26,520
it out until the next
regular session.

401
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,410
Pressure the Administration as much
as possible and if they get lucky,

402
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,230
the Prime Minister-designate
may voluntarily withdraw.

403
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,690
Yee-haw!

404
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:42,870
By now, Baek Do Hyeon's butt hole must
feel like it's sitting on a burning fuse.

405
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,530
I am sorry to ask to see you
at this late hour, Speaker.

406
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,880
It's fine. So,
what's the matter?

407
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,800
The filibuster, you
must not allow it.

408
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,940
If it's about that, I've already
notified each party's floor leader.

409
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,720
That I will allow it.<br>-
That is why I am here.

410
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,340
Speaker, please reconsider.

411
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,589
It was lawfully requested
according to the conditions

412
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,820
and procedures set down by
the National Assembly Law.

413
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:24,100
I, the leader of the
legislature, must obey the law.

414
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,100
This is not over a general matter
like a bill or a resolution.

415
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,120
The motion to appoint the Prime Minister
is an urgent personnel replacement matter.

416
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,340
If you allow the filibuster, it will not
only lengthen the administrative vacuum

417
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,520
but also set bad precedent.

418
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,120
Before becoming the
Assembly Speaker,

419
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,860
I was once your Pro-BH sunbae. And
as such, I will say this to you.

420
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,120
Befitting your position as the VIP's
closest aide, please guide him properly.

421
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,770
What?

422
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,211
How can you let him
appoint a person like Joo.

423
00:26:53,223 --> 00:26:55,410
Cheol Soon to the post
of Prime Minister?

424
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,950
I am a person who will
leave Yeouido in 1 year.

425
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,910
But how can I look forward to my
retirement when politics is in this state?

426
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,070
Speaker!<br>- Be careful
on your way out.

427
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,914
For the Assembly agenda
8, I propose a revised

428
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:24,550
bill regarding the Employment
Insurance Fund Act.

429
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,640
Please vote.

430
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,980
<i>Electronic voting machine</i>

431
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,760
<i>[YES]</i>

432
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,220
I'll announce the
result of the voting.

433
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,180
Of the 278 attendees,
270 voted in favor.

434
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,020
The other 8 voted against the bill.
Therefore, I declare the bill passed.

435
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,680
Next, for Assembly agenda 9,

436
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,650
I propose a revised bill regarding
the Labor Standards Act.

437
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,270
I get to see the filibuster
that I had only heard about.

438
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,870
I wonder who came up
with such a great idea?

439
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,450
I know.

440
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,990
When will the agenda item on confirming
the Prime Minister be proposed?

441
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,330
At the end.

442
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,394
What should we do about
the BH and the leaders

443
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,090
of the Gookmin Party
being all roiled up?

444
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,120
Whether you are from the
BH or a party leader,

445
00:28:33,132 --> 00:28:35,980
we have to come up some
kind of counterplan.

446
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,060
Are we just helplessly taken in?

447
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,840
Instead of sitting still here, why don't
we go complain to the Assembly Speaker?

448
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,400
I already met everybody that I
had to, but they won't budge.

449
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,560
This really...

450
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,380
Where is Secretary General Baek?

451
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,740
I told you to come with him.

452
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,320
I think he's organizing
his thoughts.

453
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,480
Please, let's wait.

454
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,220
<i>Hello?</i>

455
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,120
Elder, I am Baek Do Hyeon.

456
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,040
<i>What happened?</i>

457
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:15,080
I'm sorry to say it but I wish for
you to yield this time, Elder.

458
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,470
Why do you keep asking me to come out while
I am attending the Assembly meeting?

459
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,970
Before the agenda of confirming
the Prime Minister is proposed,

460
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,690
remove all your party members
from the Assembly meeting.

461
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,590
So that the ruling party members
can unanimously pass it.

462
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,789
Hey, Do Hyeon! I know you
are out of your mind right

463
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:38,970
now. But you have to say
something that makes sense.

464
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,250
I'll accommodate
everything you guys want.

465
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,750
Just do it that way.

466
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,110
Will Joo Cheol Soon withdraw?

467
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,390
No. An inter-party summit.

468
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,519
After the Prime Minister
takes the oath of office,

469
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:59,150
within 15 days, the
President will announce it.

470
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,030
You really mean it?<br>-If you
want, I can put it in writing.

471
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,540
Let me report to my boss.

472
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,840
Now, now, everyone, let's leave.

473
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,120
What the...?

474
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,350
Look, look...!

475
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:27,260
Look here. What do you think all
of you are doing right now?

476
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,950
What is this?

477
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,850
Yes, Assemblyman.

478
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,658
All Korean Democratic Party
members are saying they are

479
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,390
taking an adjournment and
leaving and stuff right now!

480
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,510
What's happening?

481
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,100
Really?

482
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,220
Yes, everybody is
leaving right now.

483
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,030
I'll immediately find
out and call you.

484
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,460
<i>(FROM JOO CHEUL SOON)<br>To my
junior whom I love, sorry.</i>

485
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,070
Aide Choi.

486
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,130
Yesterday, irrespective of the
Korean Democratic Party's position,

487
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,479
100 or so of the party
assemblymen voluntarily

488
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:12,300
submitted requests
for a filibuster.

489
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,786
That may be able to delay
appointment of the Prime.

490
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:17,540
Minister but it cannot ultimately
stop such appointment.

491
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,676
While minimizing the citizens'
inconvenience caused

492
00:31:19,688 --> 00:31:21,630
by the administrative
vacuum in the government,

493
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,161
still in order to convey the
people's stern disapproval to

494
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,760
the Seo Dae Han Administration
and Prime Minister-designate,

495
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,640
all members of our party
have decided to boycott

496
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:33,750
the Prime Minister's
ratification vote.

497
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,580
<i>Adjournment in progress.</i>

498
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,380
So a lucky guy will stay
lucky, no matter what?

499
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,090
There must have been some sort of deal
between the ruling and opposition parties.

500
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:54,240
Deal? When businessmen enter into
deals, they usually make profits.

501
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,450
But this... Who will
benefit from this and how?

502
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,200
Oh.

503
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,070
Take a look at these so
you can feel better.

504
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,710
They are civil complaints
from Joo Hee's

505
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:14,020
schoolmates. There are lots
of interesting stories.

506
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,170
<i>Because the school food tastes
bad, I don't want to eat it.</i>

507
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,680
<i>Assemblyman, who invented studying?
I don't want to study.</i>

508
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,890
<i>Assemblyman, please make a law so
that working late won't happen.</i>

509
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,050
Humph...

510
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,190
<i>In regards to that, everybody
did it that way in those days.</i>

511
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,250
<i>It turned out that way because I was
trying to lead a diligent life.</i>

512
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,620
<i>Please, be generously
understanding.</i>

513
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,000
Aide Choi.<br>-Yes?

514
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,710
When the kids grow up and
when they become our age,

515
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,490
if politics is still like
this, it won't do, right?

516
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:09,250
That's right. It can't be.

517
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:14,770
The right thing to do is to get
rid of Joo Cheol Soon, right?

518
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,070
No, we can't let him stay.

519
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:30,400
Ah, now, I will lay before you
today's last agenda item.

520
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,720
Agenda item number 145,

521
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,597
I lay before you the motion
to ratify the appointment

522
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:38,910
of Prime Minister-designate
Joo Cheol Soon.

523
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,856
In connection with this agenda,
originally there were requests

524
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:50,140
from 100 assemblymen including
Assemblyman Jo Woong Gyu

525
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,790
for unlimited debate. However,
since everybody has left...

526
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,210
Still there is one remaining.

527
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,385
Because my aide took my
seal and stamped it on.

528
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:08,170
Assemblyman Jo Woong
Gyu's requesting letter.

529
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,160
Then, Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, please come
up and go ahead with your unlimited debate.

530
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,620
Yes.

531
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,500
Yes.

532
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,800
I have so much here.

533
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,575
Aigoo, all the players
have left the ring and the

534
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:39,760
game is over. So what is
he trying to pull again?

535
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,050
At any rate, he's a
master of interference.

536
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,730
What does he plan to
do all by himself?

537
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,330
Um, Speaker, how many hours till
the end of the special session?

538
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:00,250
Since it's until
midnight tomorrow,

539
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,000
it will be 25 hours.

540
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,860
Oh, 25 hours. Okay.

541
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,110
Okay.<br><i>22:59</i>

542
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,060
25 hours.

543
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,300
25 hours.

544
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,020
Don't forget.

545
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,940
If you leave the lectern or stop
making statements for a while,

546
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,320
or if you keep making statements
unrelated to the agenda,

547
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,450
the filibuster will stop.

548
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,020
But don't you know me?
A flame-like

549
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,080
man among men,
scorch, scorch, huh!

550
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,690
JSP. What is with
the atmosphere?

551
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,950
Yes, I am Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil of the Gookmin Party.

552
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,250
I am also the leader of the
Indifferent-to-BH faction.

553
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:46,690
First, because I think
you'll be watching,

554
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:50,800
I will be talking to Prime
Minister Candidate Joo Cheol Soon.

555
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,460
Since it's not too
late, resign cleanly.

556
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,930
Apologize to the people.<br><i>Stop it.
What are you doing?</i>

557
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,940
Come down from the lectern!

558
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,270
What is with your attitude?

559
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,730
So, even if you are the only
one, you want to resist, huh?

560
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,590
Okay. Let's see.

561
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,990
<i>I understand.</i>

562
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,850
<i>From now on,</i>

563
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:22,620
<i>Let me give it a
TRY: Filibuster.</i>

564
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,030
Start.

565
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:38,920
<i>12TH HOUR: 11:00 AM.</i>

566
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,490
Mom, I'm hungry.

567
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,160
<i>Yes, candidate Joo
Cheul Soon is...</i>

568
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,980
<i>even if the allegations made against
you are only allegations...<br></i>

569
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,160
Mom, what is Dad doing?

570
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,970
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's
filibuster has passed twelve hours.</i>

571
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,550
<i>The special Assembly session
will close in 13 hours from now.</i>

572
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,490
<i>Whether Jin Sang Pil's
filibuster will succeed,</i>

573
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,566
<i>or whether ratification of
Candidate Joo Cheol Soon</i>

574
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:09,310
<i>will pass, all eyes are
turned to the outcome.</i>

575
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,820
<i>14 Hours Later; 01:00 PM.</i>

576
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,460
I, Jin Sang Pil,
will ask of you.

577
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,540
Candidate Joo Cheol Soon,
please resign on your own.

578
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:26,280
Then, you will be applauded
by the people and

579
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,870
it's the only thing that
you can do for the people.

580
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,570
I understand so
stop and come down.

581
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,840
Enough already.<br>- Mr. Speaker,
please stop him right now.

582
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,400
What do you think you
are doing right now?

583
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,300
Let me go home, please.

584
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,430
Be quiet! Your fellow assemblyman is
in the middle of making his statement!

585
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,030
Here. Here. Everybody,
please be quiet.

586
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,220
Assemblyman Jin,
please continue.

587
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,860
Okay, I'll continue.

588
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,790
The best thing Candidate
Joo Cheol Soon can do...

589
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,750
How many hours on earth has it been?
Driving me insane, seriously!

590

Hey! How can you be sleeping during this
crisis? Did you send the song lyrics?

595
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,330

It's been over a minute
since he stopped talking.

641
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,580
Make him stop now.

642
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,600
Stop the speech and
step down now.

643
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,040
Let's go now. I'm
seriously exhausted.

644
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,680
Assemblyman Jin. Are you
done with your remark?

645
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,300
No, no. I need some water.

646
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,880
He's about to collapse!
Get him to stop now.

647
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,760
Let us sleep!

648
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,000
Why bother bringing
water to him?

649
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,360
Just moisten your throat.

650
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,980
Have strength.

651
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,140
Thank you.

652
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,100
The best act of patriotism that.

653
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,540
Nominee Joo Cheol Soon can do

654
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,740
is not to become the
Prime Minister,

655
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:16,480
but to reflect on
himself and withdraw.

656
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,580
What's wrong with this?

657
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,080
What's going on?

658
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,140
Secretary Song. Didn't you
send the speech material?

659
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,520
I sent it all.

660
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,580
Battery, battery.

661
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,880
What the heck!

662
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,660
It's out of battery.

663
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,820
The print-outs of the speech.
Give it to him quickly!

664
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,760
It's over there.

665
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,900
Here.

666
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,480
You'll run to the Assembly
Hall at full speed, got it?

667
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,400
Gyu Hwan, the postcards.

668
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,980
Bring the postcards.

669
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:52,180
Postcards... In his office.
Hurry!

670
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,400
<i>22 hours and 20 minutes elapsed.
9:20pm.</i>

671
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,560
To be square and honorable,

672
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,600
even at the wind that
blows on the leaves...

673
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,420
Wait.

674
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,920
I'm having cramps.

675
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,260
Thank you.

676
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,220
<i>22 hours and 40 minutes elapsed.
9:40pm</i><br>These are...

677
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,400
civil complaints that
my daughter's friends

678
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,100
sent me.

679
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,700
Here, they talk behind
their teachers,

680
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,660
complain about their school
lunches and all that stuff.

681
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,260
What does that have to do with
the motion of the appointment?

682
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,020
What are you talking about?

683
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,680
What jibberish are you
blabbering about now?

684
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,040
Assemblyman Jin. Please only speak of
things related to the topic on the agenda.

685
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,360
They're all related.

686
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,200
A few days ago,

687
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,660
I ran into someone
and he told me this.

688
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,500
The things that are illegal now

689
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,540
all used to be customary
in the old days.

690
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:16,340
It just so happened as he was
trying to live life diligently.

691
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,760
But you know what?

692
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,160
If you look here,

693
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,180
"Dear Assemblyman. My
dad has a bad liver,"

694
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,700
so his face is becoming
darker and darker.

695
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:36,960
"Please make a law so that he won't
have to work overtime every night."

696
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,380
"My mom, to afford
private tutoring,"

697
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,180
started working at a grocery store, and
ever since then, she gets easily annoyed.

698
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,520
"I wish the customers at the grocery
store were a little nicer."

699
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,600
"My mom..."

700
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,340
"My poor dad...

701
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,260
"My mom...

702
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,980
"My parents never
pass the interviews

703
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,020
and can't get a job."

704
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,800
What, these people...

705
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,540
Do these people live like this
because they didn't live diligently?

706
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,660
<i>What's living diligently?</i>

707
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:29,700
Being shrewd and sneaky, is that
living diligently? Is that it?

708
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,900
It's not! These people are the
ones that are living diligently.

709
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,440
These people who struggle to get
by each day, not breaking the law.

710
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,140
The moms and dads
of these students.

711
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,980
Mr. Joo Cheol Soon.

712
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,140
Don't you think so?

713
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,000
Don't you?

714
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,700
<i>24 hours and 30 minutes elapsed.
11:30pm.</i>

715
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:25,960
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

716
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,240
Assemblyman Jin. Are you
going to be alright?

717
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,020
Yes, of course. I'm
perfectly fine.

718
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:49,220
Next, what I'll say next is...
Mr. Speaker.

719
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,960
I'll ask one thing
to Assemblyman Jin.

720
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,600
Do you want to become a celebrity?
This is irresponsible instigation.

721
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,720
This is tyranny by the minority
camouflaged as a lawful act.

722
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,460
Now, the Prime Minister-designate
and this government

723
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,436
as well as every member of
the opposition party who

724
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:17,340
decided not to attend will
suffer a grievous wound.

725
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:23,400
And all the damage will
spread to our citizens.

726
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,200
Is this your so-called
politics for the people?

727
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,000
Yes.

728
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,740
To be honest,

729
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,560
I'm not sure if

730
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,840
this is for the people.

731
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:52,200
But I believe that this
is what the people

732
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,900
desperately want. Yes.

733
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,380
That's what I think.

734
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,600
I'll continue.

735
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:17,540
<i>23:50</i> I, Jin Sang Pil,

736
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,900
demand again.

737
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,640
I urge Nominee Joo Cheol Soon
to withdraw voluntarily.

738
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,300
That's the only
way you can still

739
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:37,180
be applauded by the people
and give them hope.

740
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,580
<i>The most patriotic act Nominee
Joo Cheol Soon can do</i>

741
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,200
is not to become the
prime minister,

742
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,940
but to reflect on
himself and step down.

743
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,400
Lastly,

744
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,080
let me ask the stenographer.

745
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,920
All the things I
said until now...

746
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,400
You don't have to
record any of them.

747
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,660
But, for later,

748
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:24,240
for these kids, please make
sure to record these words.

749
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,760
Even if Nominee Joo Cheol Soon

750
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,700
gets appointed Prime
Minister, the citizens

751
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,520
will never acknowledge him.

752
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:47,040
That our citizens opposed him
from the beginning to the end.

753
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,940
That our citizens will
never acknowledge

754
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,120
someone who's committed such illegal
acts of corruption, not even a day,

755
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,390
no, not even a
minute nor a second,

756
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:07,350
as.

757
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:12,100
Our leader.

758
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,710
That they will continue
to do so in the future.

759
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:33,870
He really shouldn't become one.

760
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:57,320
Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!

761
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,340
It's past midnight, so I
declare everyone is dismissed.

762
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,750
Since the session is finished,

763
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:13,930
I declare the 347th Extra Session
of the National Assembly closed.

764
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:20,020
Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!

765
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,150
Only Jin Sang Pil became a star.

766
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:50,010
Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!

767
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,440
Assemblyman.<br>-
Assemblyman Jin!

768
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,920
Sang Pil! Oh no,
Assemblyman Jin!

769
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,540
What about the medics?<br>-Aide.

770
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,440
At least, you should have prepared
for that. How can you work this way?

771
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,910
Aide.<br>-What?

772
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,090
Is he sleeping?<br>-Yes.

773
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,540
Yes.

774
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:38,120
Aicham! Really!

775
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,420
Let's go.

776
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,310
Dang!

777
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,140
Wow. Now I feel I can live.

778
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,670
For a guy who can't stand to be
hungry, you really did well.

779
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:06,230
It's not that I was hungry,

780
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,370
I thought I was going to
die because I had to piss.

781
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:12,400
I thought I was going to piss
so I couldn't drink any water.

782
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,100
I should have... pissed
all over there.

783
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:22,490
But will you be okay without
going to the hospital?

784
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,340
Aihew! I have no problem
with doing this much work.

785
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,973
Hyung Seong Gi! Do you
remember that we used to work

786
00:53:28,985 --> 00:53:31,430
all day and night for
double shifts all the time?

787
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,920
You are right! Right.

788
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,300
We used to bet who would work
more overtime within a month,

789
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,190
among you, me and Hyung Dal Soo.

790
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,880
Oh, no. You are not
a senseless idiot.

791
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,650
Why are you bringing up
Bae Dal Soo's name here?

792
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:50,180
Don't get bothered. It is okay.

793
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:54,150
Indeed, we used to do that.

794
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,170
Always, Hyung Dal Soo won.

795
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:02,690
He used to say he would not leave
his son uneducated due to no money.

796
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,240
So, he really worked very hard.

797
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,060
It looks like Bae
Dal Soo had a son.

798
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,570
Yes.

799
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:15,240
Well, what was his name?

800
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,420
Gi... Gi... Since it was a long
time ago, I can't remember.

801
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,930
By the way, why have I not seen
Gyu Hwan since a while ago?

802
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,780
I guess he went to bed
because he was tired.

803
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:35,290
<i>Request to Draft a Bill.</i>

804
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:46,170

805
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,050
Aren't you asleep?

806
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:52,650
No. I am doing something...<br>- Oh.

807
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:02,110
You are really making something, huh?

808
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:04,260
Yes.

809
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,180
What kind of a bill?

810
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:14,040
Just... I want to make a law for the
ordinary fathers in this world.

811
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,370
What?

812
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:19,770
But, since I don't know what to do,

813
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,710
it is possible I may not make it.

814
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,790
Why? Try to make it well.

815
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:28,730
If you don't know well,
you can ask Aide Choi.

816
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,910
Yes. I understand.

817
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,060
Okay.

818
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,250
Have a sweet dream.

819
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,320
Go to bed quickly.

Yes. Sunbae-nim. Have you been doing well?

827
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:07,980
No, not really. Nothing goes well.
I lost face before Elder as well.

828
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:13,990
VIP did well to make Candidate
Joo Cheol Soon withdraw.

829
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,970
I have analyzed the reason why I
was defeated by Assemblyman Jin.

830
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,360
What is the reason?

831
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,920
The thought that you were my sole opponent.

832
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:31,320
Then, now, against Assemblyman Jin,

833
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,530
have you revised your plan?

834
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,158
For the person who doesn't
work with a brain, I

835
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:38,810
have no other choice but
to take a knife to him.

836
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,450
Sunbae-nim.

837
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,370
You'd better clean around Assemblyman Jin.

838
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:52,090
Then, that is a relief.

839
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,960
Among the politicians I have experienced,

840
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,780
he is the cleanest person.

841
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:02,140
Then...

842
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,000
Secretary General! I have
something urgent to report.

843
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,100
What is it?

844
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,430
I found a strange thing while checking
the people around Assemblyman Jin.

845
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:30,430
What is this?

846
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,970
Hey! Sim Dong Cheon! Do you want to die?

847
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,400
What is this again?

848
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,090
Didn't I tell you to check
before it went to print or not?!

849
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,980
I'm sorry. I did try to check but...

850
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,500
What?

851
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,870
What is this about?

852
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:55,830
What is it? Jin Sang, come on!

853
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,890
Immediately contact the printer and
tell them to print correction stickers.

854
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:02,070
So you want to put 20,000
stickers over the error?

855
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:04,530
Then, do we have to reprint
when we don't have any money?

856
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:08,030
Whatever is needed, we have to do it!

857
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:10,140
Yes.

858
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,680
Wait.

859
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:18,180
What is the matter?

860
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:31,030
Assemblyman. For your fan
club around the country,

861
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,480
your nickname has just been confirmed.

862
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,980
What is it?

863
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,160
"Gookmin Jin Sang".<br>[PEOPLE'S TRUTH]

864
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,000
Gookmin jin sang.

865
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,120
People's Truth?

866
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,780
What?

867
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,350
It's a nickname that suits our Assemblyman.

868
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:55,960
PEOPLE'S TRUTH. GOOKMIN JIN SANG: Pil!
<br>(<I>PIL = "NEED" OR "NECESSITY".</I>)

869
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,810
What did you say, you punk? I let you
loose these days and you... come here.

870
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,210
Hey.

871
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,396
<i>His name is Kim Gyu Hwan but
his real name is Bae Gyu.</i>

872
01:00:04,408 --> 01:00:07,250
<i>Hwan. He is the son of the
deceased Bae Dal Soo.</i>

873
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,950
Bae Dal...

874
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:16,950
<i>Resume.</i>

875
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:21,790
This person is Assemblyman
Jin's secretary now?

876
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:27,740
Yes. Neither the staff in the office nor
Assemblyman Jin know his identity yet.

877
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,190
I will catch Jin Sang
Pil using this friend.

878
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,450
Please approve it.

879
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,600
I understand. I will be back.

880
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,530
Where did you say you are going?

881
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:48,290
Meeting room ♪2 at the second floor.

882
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,140
By the way, aren't you holding this?

883
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,800
Is it heavy?

884
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,830
This punk!

885
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,120
<i>Resume.</i>

886
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,190
Go for it!

887
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:10,910
