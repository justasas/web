4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:14,000
If just one more chance had
been given to that person,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
no, even if he could have had a belief that
one more chance would be given to him,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,200
in my opinion, I absolutely believe that
he would not have climbed that tall crane.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,940
Assemblyman...

8
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,670
has even bet his
life on this bill.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,500
If something goes wrong, that
will be your responsibility.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,550
Yes, so for me, the real
name of this bill is...

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,060
<i>Bae Dal Soo...</i>

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,550
Bae Dal Soo and a second
chance, my butt...

13
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,820
Chairman Park, shouldn't there be
a limit to appealing to sympathy?

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,070
Politics...

15
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,460
being done this way...
is asking for trouble.

16
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,090
<i>I am about to climb a crane.</i>

17
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,990
<i>I will come down even if only one
of my two wishes comes true.</i>

18
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,220
<i>Even if I don't get
the job back...</i>

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,480
<i>if you become an assemblyman who
receives the people's applause,</i>

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,410
<i>I will come down.</i>

21
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,360
<i>See you then.</i>

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,880
So this was it.

23
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,250
What my father
really wished for.

24
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,680
If you know it now, stop
fooling around and come back.

25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,950
This phone... can't
you give it to me?

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,100
All right.

27
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,290
Assemblyman.

28
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,060
What?

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,620
The bill... I really
appreciate it.

30
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,380
Hey, that sort of thing... should
be said once it is passed.

31
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,190
Do you think you have the
ability to get the bill passed?

32
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,300
This kid is selling
me short again.

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,100
Don't you trust me?

34
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,900
I trust you, but

35
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,020
I don't trust this parliament.

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,500
What, punk?

37
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,510
This is enough for me.

38
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,150
I will take my leave.

39
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,560
I will look for another part-time
job, so don't worry too much.

40
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,840
Gyu Hwan, you know
how obnoxious I am.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,390
I will leave your spot
open until you come back.

42
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,440
<i>Episode 19.</i>

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,670
What are you doing
right now?<b>- What?</b>

44
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,787
You must think about working
with the Assemblyman

45
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,460
and realizing your
father's dying wish.

46
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,230
But what are you
doing right now?

47
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,370
I think

48
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,420
my presence will only burden
the Assemblyman more.

49
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,960
Kim Gyu Hwan!<b>- I am sorry.</b>

50
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,340
But I think this is the best

51
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,290
for both the Assemblyman and me.

52
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,180
For a runaway,

53
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,030
you come up with a
pretty good excuse.

54
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,370
Okay, go. Go and

55
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,770
live your life like a runaway.

56
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,544
With your perennial
test-taking buddies, talking

57
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,050
about three, five,
seven given-up things,

58
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,720
pouring out curses towards
the world, live like that.

59
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,810
Aide-nim!<b>- When I was your age,</b>

60
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,620
I at least had a conviction that I must
fight against the bad things in the world.

61
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,250
I didn't flee like
you, understand?

62
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,890
When you were young,

63
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,600
the world must have been
a really romantic place.

64
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,300
What?<b>- Without any power,</b>

65
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,580
you even considered
fighting against the world.

66
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,500
Should I tell you what my and
my friends' conviction is?

67
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,480
That if a friend wins,
then I will lose.

68
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,270
The politics that
you love so much...

69
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,520
has shaped such a world.

70
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,730
The economy is in
a very bad state.

71
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,220
During the remaining
regular session,

72
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,560
please lend your support
to pass economic bills.

73
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,750
I itch to do it.

74
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,860
But they are so different
from my party's position.

75
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,810
Economic austerity...
will be a problem.

76
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,940
Because of the
economic difficulties,

77
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,300
we must tighten our belt.

78
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,360
That is an old method.

79
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,990
We must rather increase government
spending to boost consumption.

80
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,630
What are you going to do if
an economic crisis results?

81
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,470
Didn't you see a few countries in
Europe suffering from that problem?

82
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,000
Our party believes that Korea
still has a strong balance sheet.

83
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,500
To maintain a strong
balance sheet,

84
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
our party's position is
that we must scrimp.

85
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,770
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil seems
to have a different idea.

86
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,140
So, are you going to
lend your support

87
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,900
to that Bae Dal Soo's
law or something?

88
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,760
We are reviewing it.

89
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,350
I really like its spirit.

90
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,170
The largest opposition party

91
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,710
with 139 seats

92
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,470
will content itself with being a
trainbearer to a populist bill?

93
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,570
You got beaten

94
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,670
to the punch by
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

95
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,740
If I were you, Party Leader Oh,

96
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,060
I would find a new issue.

97
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,378
<i>Gookmin Party Emergency Response
Commission Chairman Park.</i>

98

<i>Choon Seop and Korean Democartic

<i>met at National Assembly's
Sarangje House this afternoon</i>

100
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,645
<i>and exchanged opinions

101
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,110
<i>political issues including
the regular session.</i>

102
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,560
<i>In the ensuing private
meeting, reportedly</i>

103
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,940
<i>they had an in-depth discussion about
policies to stimulate the economy.</i>

104
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,460
<i>While both sides are deeming
today's meeting satisfactory,</i>

105
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,370
<i>whether the issues discussed today
will be smoothly dealt with</i>

106
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,190
<i>remains to be seen...</i>

107
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,350
Aish, darn it, why won't they say even
one word about Hyung Dal Soo's Law, huh?

108
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,010
It was on the 9
O'Clock News earlier.

109
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,230
Today's short story?

110
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,170
Just a one-line caption, does
that qualify as being reported?

111
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,970
But we should be
thankful even for that.

112
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,940
So deflated from the beginning,

113
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,340
what blasted law will
you manage to make?

114
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,930
Jeez, I will make one somehow.

115
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,730
<i>I trust you, but I don't
trust this parliament.</i>

116

<i>This is enough for me.</i>

<i>The politics that you love so
much has shaped such a world.</i>

119
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,170
Yes, Assemblyman.<b>-
Did I wake you up?</b>

120
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,250
I'm sorry for calling
you so late.

121
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,840
That's okay.

122
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,860
But is anything the matter?

123
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,700
Umm, Aide Choi.

124
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,250
Yes.

125
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,790
Let us...

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,190
get Hyung Dal Soo's Law...

127
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,020
passed no matter what.

128
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,370
Why aren't you answering me?

129
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,580
We can do it, right?

130
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,320
Yes,

131
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,120
we can do it.

132
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,460
No, we must do it.

133
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,980
Step one?

134
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,690
Now, everyone, thoroughly
prepare yourselves.

135
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,840
From now on, this is war.

136
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,590
What is Step One?

137
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,250
<i>Introduction of the Bill.</i>

138
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,310
Introduction of the bill?

139
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,070
In order to introduce a bill,
including yours, the primary sponsor,

140
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,100
10 assemblymen's
seals are necessary.

141
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,370
<i>Cheon No Shim</i>

142
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,990
I will get the seals of the other 3
assemblymen of the Socialist Party as well.

143
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,250
Aigo, thank you.
Thank you very much!

144
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,900
<i>Bill Sponsors'
Signature Document.</i>

145
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,370
Still, we are lacking 5 more.

146
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,550
I will find out if there were assemblymen
who introduced similar bills before.

147
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,670
Oh...

148
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,370
Good idea.

149
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,810
Aide Seo!<b>- Yes.</b>

150
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,270
Contact the aides of thoughtless,
troublemaking assemblymen.

151
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,590
Your assemblyman slapped
a street cleaner and

152
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,750
got cussed out. Do you
think that is in the past?

153
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,369
Just see what happens during
the election time. The rival

154
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:12,650
opposition party candidate
will bring it up again.

155
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,878
<i>There is no way they
won't endorse this bill</i>

156
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,630
<i>since they are frantic
to change their images.</i>

157
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,170
If he wants to get re-elected, he must
clean up his super arrogant image.

158
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,610
Hurry and get his seal here.

159
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,330
The bill was filed with the
Ministry of Government Legislation.

160
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,630
Aide-nim, Step One accomplished.

161
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,404
Then, we just need to
introduce it to the relevant

162
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,710
standing committee and
win their approval.

163
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:54,330
We have a hurdle to
overcome before that.

164
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,370
What hurdle?<b>- The hidden
force of the Assembly...</b>

165
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,290
the standing committee
expert consultant.

166
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,290
<i>Chief Expert Consultant.</i>

167
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,859
<i>He is the head of all

<i>officers who preliminarily
review and report</i>

<i>on all matters of policy, including bills

170

<i>His report hugely influences the

<i>To the government's civil
servants, the expert consultant</i>

173

00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,690
<i>We must secure a positive opinion about Bae
Dal Soo's Law from this expert consultant.</i>

175
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,240
Consultant, this... My aides
worked like dogs to make this.

176
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,029
For your easy perusal,
everything is categorized.

177
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,950
From public hearings, from
other countries' examples,

178
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,950
projected cost from the budget
office, everything is here.

179
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,940
Yes, please look at this; Take a good look
at this, and write us a review report.

180
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,370
Ah... but this seems to
require too much budget.

181
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:56,110
But that's just the government's noise
making. You haven't looked at any of this!

182
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,790
An expert consultant is a civil
servant working for the legislature,

183
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,090
not a parrot dispatched
by the executive branch.

184
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,210
Please be on the people's side and
write us a good review report.

185
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,050
And please skip such expressions
as "careful evaluation."

186
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,990
Do you understand or don't you?!

187
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:25,510
Good work. This will give the assemblymen
a positive first impression.

188
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,830
Really? See? I am at this level.

189
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,910
Now, if only the media would
lighten up the mood...

190
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,910
Don't worry. That's
my specialty.

191
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,510
Bae Dal Soo's Law is
not a simple bill.

192
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:53,550
It is a message of hope to our citizens
drained from cutthroat competition.

193
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,830
And...<b>- <i>Ad lib?</i></b>

194
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,550
An apology from our world of politics,
which has been indifferent to

195
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,800
the tears of the defeated.

<i>Introduction to the
Standing Committee.</i>

198
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,790
<i>I put before you the bill to
give a second chance to bankrupt</i>

199

200
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,000
<i>STEP TWO: Introduction of
bill to the Standing Committee.</i>

201
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,550
Assemblyman Jin,
please speak up.

202
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,300
Yes.

203
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,330
Yes, I am Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil.

204
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,750
I will explain the
intent behind this bill.

205
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,430
After the Asian financial
crisis of late 1990s,

206
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,600
cutthroat competition has become the
norm in all sections of society.

207
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,250
<i>STEP THREE: Standing
Committee Review.</i>

208
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,433
<i>However, among the
citizens who have dropped</i>

209
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,930
<i>out or lost out in
the competition,</i>

210
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,730
<i>there are really honest
and diligent individuals.</i>

211
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,090
<i>A social system to save
and aid those individuals</i>

212
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,930
<i>is severely lacking.
Therefore...</i>

213
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,790
Hyung Dal Soo must be watching
from up there too, right?

214
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,910
<i>It's not the end...</i>

215
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,410
Yes.

216
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,870
He must be.

217
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,410
<i>...create such social
atmosphere and...</i>

218
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,710
We have barely taken
our first step.

219
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,010
It's not yet the time
to be rejoicing.

220
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,370
<i>...a second chance to laid
off workers and bankrupts...</i>

221
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,510
Isn't that blood, blood?
Nosebleed!

222
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,930
Oh no, what should we do?

223
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,910
Assemblyman Jin!

224
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,530
I guess he overexerted himself.

225
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,970
Yes, I'm sorry.
Yes, I will go on.

226
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,550
So I think, to such people,

227
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,730
this is a bill that can
really give dreams and hopes.

228
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,850
I will just eat it.

229
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,510
But you are tired.
Just open your mouth.

230
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,950
Men should eat these things.

231
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,730
You want to eat it...

232
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,890
But Assemblywoman
Cheon sent this?

233
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,850
Yes, call her and thank her.

234
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,310
Oh, really, I should.

235
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,090
Speaking of which...
she's calling me.

236
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,110
Aigo, Assemblywoman Cheon, you shouldn't
have sent me this kind of valuable thing.

237
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,570
I did it to energize you when you
are giving valuable service.

238
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,510
Aigoo, thank you really.

239
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,950
Enough about that.

240
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,870
Assemblyman Jin, a problem has come
up in reviewing Bae Dal Soo's Law.

241
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:30,390
What problem? The committee
has decided to review it.

242
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,980
Not only members from Gookmin
Party, but also those from Korean

243
00:17:32,992 --> 00:17:35,310
Democratic Party are saying
the review should be put off.

244
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,950
Wh-what?

245
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,690
Thank you, Reporter Kim.

246
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,210
I think I know the reason.

247
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,910
What is it?

248
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,490
According to the oldest hand
covering the opposition party,

249
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,910
the Korean Democratic Party is preparing
a bill similar to Bae Dal Soo's Law.

250
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,430
They are saying they won't play second
fiddle to the Indifferent-to-BH faction.

251
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,610
What do we do? If the Korean
Democratic Party introduces

252
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,310
a bill, Bae Dal Soo's Law
will get buried by it.

253
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,050
Or get absorbed into their bill.

254
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,510
Wow, really, they're
being too much.

255
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,240
Party Leader Oh Sae Chang!

256
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,450
Hello.

257
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,590
What brings you here,
Assemblyman Jin?

258
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,710
I heard that there is a factory
making designer knock-offs here.

259
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,230
So I'm here to meet
the factory boss.

260
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,590
What are you talking about?

261
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,580
About Bae Dal Soo's Law.

262
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,340
Let's talk for a bit.

263
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,450
If it's about that, meet our party's
policy committee chairperson.

264
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,790
That's why you can't
be the ruling party.

265
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,010
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil!

266
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,459
If you're the number one
opposition party, then you

267
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,790
ought to play like one,
like a major-league team.

268
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,530
Either you support it or you don't. What
do you think you're doing right now?

269
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,010
Party Leader! I said let's talk!

270
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,490
Aish, Party Leader!

271
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,430
Aigo, Chairperson!
About my bill...

272
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,370
please urge the members
to review it soon.

273
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,030
This is a dereliction of their duty.
How many days has it been already?

274
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,008
Let's process a bill that was
introduced a short while

275
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,630
ago during this regular
session of the Assembly?

276
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,490
That's like saying let's do a sloppy job
and rush review and rush process this.

277
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,610
It's the opposite! I'm saying let's not
hold up the review and processing!

278
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,970
Let us all remember a verse from

279
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,730
the poet Midang (PEN
NAME), Seo Jeong Ju.

280
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,430
"For one blossom of
chrysanthemum to bloom,

281
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,510
I wonder if scops owl has been
crying that much since the spring."

282
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,070
In order to create something,
a long time of patience and

283
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:14,610
suffering is necessary. Isn't
that the meaning behind it?

284
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,160
How can you use a bird even when
you are giving an example, huh?

285
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,440
A bird referring
to himself, huh?

286
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,560
A scops owl, is that a
migratory or resident bird?

287
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,740
Chairperson.

288
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,630
Considering how well the bill is drafted
and how society in general feels about it,

289
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,070
there is no reason to put
it on the back burner.

290
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,900
Particularly, before next
year's budget is passed,

291
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,780
this bill must be processed
so that the people

292
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,530
can start benefiting from
it starting next year.

293
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,240
Assemblymen need time to study
the issues covered by the bill.

294
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,280
Look here!

295
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,142
What have you been doing
not studying this,

296
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:55,070
all this time? When did
I give you this, huh?

297
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,380
Why don't you work all day and study all
night? Burn the candle at both ends!

298
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,430
Review during the day,
study during the night!

299
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,320
There is an event in my constituency.
So ta-ta.

300
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,910
Assemblyman Jo!

301
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,230
You worked hard.

302
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,480
Hello, Party Leader!

303
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,340
What are you doing?

304
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,440
I felt like I was rude
to you in the morning.

305
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,410
So I want to apologize to you.

306
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,710
Drink one of these.

307
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,660
Isn't that Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi over there?<b>- Huh?</b>

308
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,700
That's right.

309
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,320
She's better looking
in real life.

310
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,470
Thank you.<b>- Yes.</b>

311
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,190
It's an honor.

312
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,480
Let's leave already, huh?<b>- Why?</b>

313
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,330
The night is still young for me.

314
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,552
I'm different from you, Ms.
Choi Double-O. A

315
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:42,650
crowded place is a bit
troublesome for me.

316
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,840
An assemblywoman must
stay near citizens.

317
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,420
Day in and day out,
you eat and drink

318
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,300
behind closed doors. So

319
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,620
you have no way of knowing
the people's hearts.

320
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,480
Ms. Choi Double-O, you
have bad drinking manners!

321
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,520
What are you talking about?

322
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,530
You may not believe it, but I
have good drinking manners.

323
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,590
If you're curious, just
ask our Assemblyman.

324
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,460
Lie!

325
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,170
Assemblywoman.<b>- Huh?</b>

326
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,540
That badge, you know...

327
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,980
If you put that on,

328
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,500
are people really

329
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,670
going to

330
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,930
flip out?

331
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,670
Do you want to try wearing it?

332
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,670
That's okay.

333
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,270
It's okay!

334
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,890
Whether your mind flips out or

335
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,930
teeter-totters, I
want to see it too.

336
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,720
I said it was okay.<b>- Stay still.
I'll put it on for you. Come here.</b>

<i>Assembly.</i>

338
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,220

343
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,090
Here you go.

344
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,250
Why don't you wear it longer?

345
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,100
You won't have an occasion
to wear it in the future.

346
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,600
What did you say?<b>- The way I see it, Ms.
Choi Double-O,</b>

347
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,770
you are a born aide.

348
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,300
Like Aide Seo, fill
up all of 20 years

349
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,790
and go for the pension.

350
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,350
I will wear a badge for sure.

351
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,900
Is a badge blind?

352
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,140
To let itself be
worn by any bosom?

353
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,950
Patrons!

354
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,410
Today... this ahjumma...

355
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,370
says she will ring
the golden bell!

356
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,360
Wow! Bravo!

357
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,070
Eat a lot.

358
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,750
Long live Korea!

359
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,770
Order everything. Order all.
Aunt!

360
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,550
We will enjoy it!

361
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,140
Assemblywoman Hong Chan Mi

362
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,500
will pay!

363
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,460
Thank you!

365
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,880
Let's go.

366
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,440
Assemblyman Jin.

367
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,640
Assemblyman Jin.

368
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,930
Ah, yes.

369
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,250
Aigo.

370
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,880
Yes.

371
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,520
Why don't we have a
bowl of warm soup?

372
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,770
Yes!

373
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,490
Now, I feel like I can live.

374
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,440
This is my favorite restaurant.
How do you like their food?

375
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,570
Yes, the broth is
to die for, really.

376
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,790
Later, when you
become the president,

377
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:06,150
are you going to take this
chef to the Blue House?

378
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,780
Assemblyman Jin.<b>-Yes.</b>

379
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,500
All I can give to you
is this hangover soup.

380
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,880
Actually, I didn't come for help
without any particular plan in mind.

381
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,290
I came here for negotiation.

382
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,030
Then, let me hear your story.

383
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,220
The bill that Korean
Democratic Party is making.

384
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,450
When are you bringing it out?

385
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,810
Since I asked to hurry it up, I
believe it will come out soon.

386
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,320
By the way, why are
you asking about it?

387
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,730
Are you going to report
that it is an imitation?

388
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:55,030
No..No. As soon as possible and an
imitation that looks as real as possible.

389
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,730
I want you make
it that way.<b>-What?</b>

390
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,600
If you do,

391
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,410
I will withdraw my bill and

392
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,350
support the Korean
Democratic Party's bill.

393
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,300
Do you mean you'll
yield to my party?

394
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,100
I understand the opposition
party's position.

395
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,619
Next year, there'll be a
general election. After

396
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,800
that, there'll be a
presidential election.

397
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,340
You have to show
accomplishments to the public.

398
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,080
But Bae Dal Soo's Law came out
in the middle of your way.

399
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,060
So your position has
gotten obscure.

400
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,170
I am very sorry about that.

401
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,620
I don't need such
an accomplishment.

402
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:44,160
Just as long as the bill is
passed, I am okay with it.

403
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,230
Look at me,
Assemblyman Jin.<b>-Yes.</b>

404
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,503
I am offended by your remark
that implies our party

405
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:50,580
is pursuing a cheap way
to earn brownie points.

406
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,657
But I'm even more offended with
your hypocrisy in pretending

407
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:54,690
that you are not concerned about
getting the credit for it.

408
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,940
Let's stop here.

409
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,910
No, Chairman, hold on.

410
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,400
I might be a hypocrite.

411
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,860
Ah... yes. I am a hypocrite.

412
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,120
Actually, regardless of the
citizens, or who loses,

413
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,300
it seems I am doing this because I
want to make my heart feel easy.

414
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,590
Yes. This is right.

415
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,500
What do you mean, again?

416
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,540
In my heart,

417
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,190
there is a man
called Bae Dal Soo.

418
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,750
A high-rise crane over
40 meters high...

419
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,700
He climbed up that crane.

420
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,260
I...

421
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,780
That person has to get
down to the ground...

422
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,870
Only after that
person gets down,

423
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,030
can I sleep comfortably
with my legs sprawled out.

424
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,740
That's how I can feel at peace.

425
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,760
Party Leader, to make
my heart feel at peace,

426
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,670
I am doing this.

427
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,890
Therefore, once,
please help me once.

428
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:03,020
Please help me once. I beg you.

429
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,500
Yes. I understand.

430
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,520
Aide Choi, he didn't
go to his house.

431
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,280
Secretary Oh, how about
Assemblyman's phone?

432
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,610
It's still not turned on.

433
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,030
Shouldn't we report
this to the police?

434
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,630
He just told me to go home
first, so I just left...

435
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,560
Yes. Of course.

436
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,231
When he said to go home,
you didn't even look back

437
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:34,860
and just went while joyfully
singing "Lululalah."

438
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,400
Still, you have to know
Assemblyman's whereabouts!

439
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,578
I tried to do that. But
even if I asked that punk,

440
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,480
he is not the kind of
punk who would answer.

441
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,630
"That punk"? Is that word supposed to
come out of the secretary's mouth?

442
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,720
I am sorry, Honey.
I... mean Aide Choi.

443
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,612
If you use vulgar words
for Assemblyman one more

444
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:03,070
time, you will have to
move to Gyeongje City.

445
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,960
Yes. I understand.

446
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,550
Good morning.

447
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,670
Assemblyman.

448
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Why? Did something happen?

449
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,990
Where on earth have
you been all night?

450
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,110
- I have been to meet my lover.
<b>- Pardon?</b>

451
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,850
My lover!

452
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,130
Whom... did you say you met?

453
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,880
Representative Oh Se Chang.

454
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,080
This is...

455
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,830
These are the five bills that the
Korean Democratic Party is pursuing?

456
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,798
Upon the condition that I
support those 5 bills,

457
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,400
I received his support
of Bae Dal Soo's bill.

458
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,180
Did I do well?

459
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,400
Assemblyman, did you really...
negotiate with Representative Oh?

460
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,800
That's what I am saying.
Can I step down now?

461
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,680
Assemblyman.

462
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,170
<i>4TH STEP: Resolution from the

463
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:32,100
<i>Let's resolve the bill for the second
chance to the unemployed and the bankrupts.</i>

464
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,490
Assemblymen who are voting
in favor please stand.

465
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,980
We made it.

466
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,900
I proclaim the bill is passed

473
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,720
Secretary Byeon, really...

474
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,820
I'll try to get the trial
advanced as early as possible.

475

Although it is hard, please
bear it a little longer.

476
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,580
Is it possible to be given
a verdict of <i>"not guilty"</i>?

477
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,590
It's impossible.

478
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,910
Damn!

479
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,050
To try to wear a badge once, I worked like
the devil going through fire and water.

480
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,970
I can't help it. I will think about
an idea for a business here.

481
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,210
Secretary General Baek,

482
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,190
please get money
ready to invest.

483
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,950
Chief Secretary Lim!

484
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,010
Five large denomination
bearer bonds...

485
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,830
With that I will keep
my mouth shut forever.

486
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,460
Our party

487
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,500
was damaged to the extent that
the anti-BH faction was formed.

488
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,280
What do you think the cause was?

489
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,260
I am not sure.

490
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,850
It is because an
identity was missing.

491
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,120
While saying things like "moderate"
or "reform conservative",

492
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,510
clumsily turning to the left wing and
then the left wing again repeatedly...

493
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,033
as a consequence, we became
recognized without acknowledging

494
00:35:09,045 --> 00:35:11,040
it as a hodgepodge party,
neither fish nor fowl.

495
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,190
I don't agree with you.

496
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,711
Future politics, whether for
the ruling or the opposition

497
00:35:15,723 --> 00:35:18,300
party, must be led by pragmatic
thinkers who are moderates.

498
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,240
Politics has to be
done with an ideology.

499
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,690
In the world, such a thing as an
<b>ideology for moderates doesn't exist.</b>

500
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,930
Then, I will leave.

501
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,020
Secretary General Baek!

502
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,920
The reason the party
is floundering...

503
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,290
I think differently
about the cause.

504
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,460
Probably, it's because
of the cheap politician

505
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,450
who traded his soul for power.

506
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,430
I have researched European
legislation from the past

507
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:24,590
with content similar to the
so-called Bae Dal Soo bill.

508
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,016
<i>Due to excessive government
spending, several European</i>

509
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:30,840
<i>countries are now on the
brink of bankruptcy.</i>

510
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,070
<i>I no longer think the second chance
law is a viable alternative for us.</i>

511
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:43,380
Irresponsible laws which appeal to
emotions will ruin the country's future.

512
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,627
It is possible to make
all the citizens losers

513
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,620
while trying to offer
some a second chance.

514
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,180
<i>I demand of Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil:</i>

515
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:00,510
<i>Please stop the emotional
politics that sell emotion</i>

516
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,710
<i>by using a laid-off
worker's tragic death.</i>

517
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,790
Bae Dal Soo doesn't exist
anymore in this world.

518
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,020
The thing that is
called the law...

519
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:15,090
is supposed to be for the
people who are alive.

520
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:17,510
Really, he is great.

521
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,470
Great, Baek Do Hyeon!

522
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,280
Now, it's hard to
look forward to.

523
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,690
Gookmin Party members'
favorable votes.

524
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,623
Assemblyman, the Emergency
Measure Committee

525
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,460
meeting will be
held in the party.

526
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,500
Huh?

527
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:53,560
Bae Dal Soo's Law, under the
idea of protecting the losers,

528
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,674
is a bill ruinous to the country,
that ruins the country's

529
00:37:56,686 --> 00:37:59,760
financial budget, discourages
the will to succeed or work,

530
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,970
and breaks down the motivating
power of social evolution.

531
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,270
As the head of the
Emergency Council for the.

532
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:12,300
Gookmin Party, I ask
that all assemblymen

533
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,720
participate in voting
during the plenary session,

534
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,890
and I hope you vote
against the bill.

535
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,525
Therefore, before finishing
the plenary session,

536
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:24,860
our Emergency Council
will not allow anyone

537
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,270
to go on a tour of inspection
abroad without exception.

538
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:36,270
Floor Leader, please make an
arrangement for everybody,

539
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,908
including the assemblymen
who hold the position of.

540
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,440
Minister concurrently and
who are hospitalized,

541
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,020
so that no one is absent and all will
be able to participate in the voting.

542
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,267
<i>Baek Do Hyeon, in
opposition to the second</i>

543
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:49,680
<i>chance bill says, "There
is no Bae Dal Soo!"</i>

544
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,550
<i>What can you get by doing this?</i>

545
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,820
<i>What do I want?</i>

546
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,040
<i>There is one thing that I want.</i>

547
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,460
<i>That I, Bae Dal Soo, not be
treated like a piece of trash!</i>

548
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,073
<i>I am not a piece of trash
whom they use as they</i>

549
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:08,820
<i>please and throw out on the
street as they please,</i>

550
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,290
<i>but I am a human being.</i>

551
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,773
<i>To say that I did not
live so insignificantly</i>

552
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,900
<i>as to be treated like
a piece of trash.</i>

553
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,270
<i>That is it... the
one thing I want!</i>

554
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,200
<i>Are you satisfied?</i>

555
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,710
<i>There is no Bae Dal Soo!</i>

556
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,180
There seems to be three or four
absentees from the opposite party.

557
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,380
Then if we don't do anything, this
means the bill will be rejected.

558
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,646
The only way to proceed now
is to get public opinion

559
00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:53,850
to apply pressure on the
Gookmin Party assemblymen.

560
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,480
If Park Choon Seop is
browbeating them like that,

561
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,100
will there be any assemblymen
who will vote in favor?

562
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:05,300
Still, let's try to do it. We
came this far. We can't quit.

563
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,428
I have already enlisted
the support of the

564
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,670
nationwide<b> Jin Ji Mo
members (<I>JSP SUPPORTERS</I>)</b>

565
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,150

<b>who assist the underprivileged.</b>

566
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,890
I will take care of the media.

567
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,140
Assemblyman.<b>- Huh?</b>

568
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,570
To the main gate of the
National Assembly. Quickly.

569
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:42,440
<i>I am Bae Dal Soo.</i>

570
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,440
Until passage of the bill, he said
he wouldn't move even one step.

571
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:56,000
Against Secretary General Baek's words
that Bae Dal Soo doesn't exist...

572
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,420
Do Hyeon.

573
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,250
The atmosphere is weird.

574
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,966
<i>The one-man demonstration by the
late Bae Dal Soo's son in front</i>

575
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:19,500

578
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,747
<i>Now, enthusiastic support

579
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:29,320

the internet and SNS.</i>

580
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,250
<i>I am Bae Dal Soo.</i>

581
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,030
<i>Religious circles, academic circles, and
famous entertainment circles as well</i>

582
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,380

587
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,380
<i>public support for the Bae

588
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,450
To the bankrupts who do their best, I think
we need to give applause and encouragement.

589
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,510
That's why I am participating.

590
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,620
I think it is a
sincere movement.

591
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:01,550
I hope as many people
as possible will join.

592
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,470
Gyu Hwan.

593
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,700
Assemblyman.

594
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Are you okay?

595
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,190
Yes. I have no problem.

596
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,870
This fool punk.

597
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:26,640
How will it go tomorrow?

598
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,530
What do you think?

599
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,370
Honestly, I don't know.

600
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,300
But... even if the the
bill doesn't pass,

601
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,670
I think I won't be
particularly sad.

602
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,800
Why?

603
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,100
People have come to find out

604
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,420
that father didn't
live a worthless life,

605
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,270
I am really thankful.

606
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,930
I am more thankful.

Yes. <b>- Your father...</b>

Yes?

614
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,290
Hello.

615
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,060
Undisciplined!

616
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,132
By the way, the plenary
session will be held

617
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,090
soon. What are the
secretaries doing here?

618
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:12,750
What do you mean what we are doing? We are
demonstrating to get the bill passed.

619
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,010
We finished our work.

620
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,760
What do you mean you finished?

621
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,520
There is a stack of
work in the office.

622
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,120
What are you doing
on the street?

623
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,660
<i>I am Bae Dal Soo.</i>

624
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,990
<i>I am also Bae Dal Soo.</i>

625
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,740
<i>We are Bae Dal Soo.</i>

626
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,700
<i>What are you doing?</i>

627
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:42,310
<i>I am Bae Dal Soo.</i>

628
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:48,390
<i>We are Bae Dal Soo.</i>

629
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,320
Assemblyman, the assemblymen
are scared right now.

630
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,200
What do you mean scared?

631
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,000
Public opinion in favor
of it is so high

632
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,030
that they feel burdened
to vote against it.

633
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,210
Do you do politics without guts?

634
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,770
I will take all the
responsibility.

635
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,450
Tell them to vote against
it without fear.

636
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,900
Yes.

637
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:17,724
If there is an assemblyman
who acts according to

638
00:45:17,736 --> 00:45:19,450
his conviction or something
and votes for it,

639
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,340
he will pay for his conviction.
Tell them that as well.

640
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,430
Yes.

641
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,380
Gosh!

642
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,340
<i>List of National Assemblymen
and Assemblywomen.</i>

643
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,240
Why? You can't estimate?

644
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,650
No. If there is no breakaway
vote from the Gookmin Party,

645
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,300
the bill will
definitely be rejected.

646
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,050
There will be voting not according to party
lines. If you see the public opinion..

647
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,130
It is hard to take
an optimistic view.

648
00:45:55,130 --> 00:46:00,250
With Park Choon Seop's charisma,
the assemblymen are overwhelmed.

649
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,710
Ah... What should we do?

650
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:12,270
I have... a good idea.

651
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,470
<i>National Assembly</i><b>-<i> Vote now.</i></b>

652
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,640
<i>I proclaim the bill is passed.</i>

653
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,980
Next, Agenda 65,

654
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,370
I present the bill that
supports the authority to

655
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,290
give a second chance to the
unemployed and the bankrupts.

656
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,090
The people who will vote
for Bae Dal Soo's Law

657
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,270
are implying that in Korea we don't already
have laws that give people a second chance.

658
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,610
They deceive the public.
Even now,

659
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,421
we give a tremendous amount
of aid to the unemployed

660
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,830
and the bankrupts through
all kinds of funds.

661
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,450
With the implication that the bill gives
one more piece of candy to a crying kid,

662
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:05,120
saying the existing aid is
tremendous is to deceive the public.

663
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,627
Some of the assemblymen
who want to vote against

664
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:09,310
it insist that, if this
bill goes into effect,

665
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:13,260
due to the need for 1 trillion won's
worth of supplementary budget,

666
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:18,800
national finances
will break down.

667
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,970
I want to ask a question
to those people.

668
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:25,050
A lot of people who have lost at
economic competition then despair,

669
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,540
give up economic activities,
suffer disease,

670
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,160
and wrestle with the temptation of
committing a criminal act or suicide.

671
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:40,380
How long are you going to keep your eyes
closed against looking at the conclusion of

672
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,933
research showing that the
annual cost to our nation

673
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:43,420
from social conflict is
tens of trillions of won?

674
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,790
Social conflict?

675
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:50,690
That happened because the
economy is difficult.

676
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:55,670
A little while ago, Assemblywoman Hong
mentioned that 1 trillion won as casually

677
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,700
as though it were petty cash.

678
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,450
That is not right.

679
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:08,170
Honestly, if you invest in a
corporation with that money,

680
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,150
jobs will be produced.
But with this way,

681
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:16,130
you give out pocket money as though
giving an allowance to poor people.

682
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,440
It will be...

683
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,642
the same as pouring
water over a duck's

684
00:48:20,654 --> 00:48:23,200
back.<b><i>(CRITICISMS HAVING
NO EFFECT ON A PERSON)</i></b>

685
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,210
If you have that much money, you'd
better invest. After investing,

686
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,680
you have to revive the economy.

687
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,510
Last,

688
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,280
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, please
make a supporting speech.

689
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,460
Yes.

690
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,620
I am Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

691
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,220
A little while ago,

692
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,470
our respectable.

693
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:05,870
Assemblyman Kang Sang Ho

694
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,914
spoke in opposition.
I found it very

695
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:12,800
impressive. I will finish
my speech briefly,

696
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,820
after asking a question
to Assemblyman Kang.

697
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,710
What is he doing?

698
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:20,440
Assemblyman Kang,
do you know Lula?

699
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:21,950
What?

700
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:26,030
Excuse me, Assemblyman Jin. Don't ask
questions, just make your statement.

701
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,530
What does he think I am?

702
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:35,370
I know Roora, too.
The Angel Lost Wing.

703
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:41,240
♬ <i>Let's go looking for an angel. Shaba
Shaba, one two three</i> ♬ <b>Is that it?</b>

704
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,990
It is not that Roora. Rather, it's
Lula, the former President of Brazil.

705
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,860
Uh...

706
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,870
He should have said
the President Lula.

707
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,430
Assemblyman Kang said,

708
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,480
let's invest to
revive the economy.

709
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:05,910
I agree totally.

710
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,170
However, I don't
agree with the words

711
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:13,260
that giving money to the poor is

712
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,630
the same as pouring water
over a duck's back.

713
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,690
I will ask the question to Assemblyman
Kang, using Lula's phrase:

714
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:27,380
How come it's called an <i>"investment"
</i> when money goes to the rich

715
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,800
but a <i>"cost"</i> when it
goes to the poor?!

716
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,050
<i>Yes?</i>

717
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,500
Giving a second
chance to the losers

718
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,340
is a worthier investment than

719
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,460
any other investment.

720
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,880
I believe...

721
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,710
that.

722
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,400
I, Jin Sang Pil,

723
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:11,610
sincerely appeal to you

724
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,500
for support.

725
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,550
I don't mean to embrace

726
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,420
the ones who didn't
put in the effort

727
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,550
and didn't do their best,

728
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,380
and so failed in competition.

729
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,480
Like Bae Dal Soo, the
one who is honest,

730
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,200
like Bae Dal Soo, the one
who follows the rules,

731
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,660
like Bae Dal Soo, the
loser who did his best,

732
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,840
I mean to embrace those.

733
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,130
Then, the world where we live,

734
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,630
will become a little warmer.

735
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:04,400
There will be more days when we
meet and smile at each other

736
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,300
than the days when we
get angry or fret.

737
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,510
I believe that.

738
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,410
Please, this Bae Dal Soo's Law...

739
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,630
Please vote in favor of it.

740
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,850
I beg you.

741
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,250
Thank you for listening to me.

742
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,020
Don't tell me. The votes aren't going
to be according to party line?

743
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,720
Not at all... <b>The votes will
be according to party line.</b>

744
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,780
More than a fifth of the
members, 82 of them,

745
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:09,500
including Assemblywoman Cheon No Shim,

746
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,750
have submitted a request that the method
of voting on this issue be changed.

747
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:19,820
Pursuant to Article 112, Paragraph
2 of the National Assembly Act,

748
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,000
we will have a secret ballot.

749
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:33,700
If that's the case, we won't be able to
find out the decisions of the assemblymen.

750
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,940
I will appoint assemblymen
to handle the poll.

751
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,188
<i>Assemblyman Kim Dae Kyung, Assemblyman
Kim Jung Suk, Assemblyman Kim Kyung.</i>

752
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,460
<i>Won, Assemblyman Kim Jung Jae, Assemblyman
Park Chan Woo. Please work hard.</i>

753
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:52,370
I can't bear it anymore
because I am so curious.

754
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,880
Aide Choi.

755
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,460
What happened?

756
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,980
Did it pass?

757
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,750
Aide Choi.

758
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:49,650
I hereby declare that the Bae
Dal Soo Second Chance Bill

759
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,500
has passed.

760
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,480
It has passed.

761
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:28,340
Assemblyman Jin, it passed.

762
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,460
Bae Dal Soo's Law passed.

763
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,930
Yes.

764
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,850
Assemblywoman, you really worked hard.

765
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,750
I...

766
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,590
The fact that it took me so long
to know what this feels like...

767
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,170
I regret it.

768
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,920
Thank you, Assemblywoman Hong.

769
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,800
Assemblyman Jin.

770
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,130
Assemblywoman Cheon.

771
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,280
Congratulations.

772
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,900
Thank you. Thank you so much.

773
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,290
Assemblyman Jin.

774
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,750
Hello?<b><i>-Aide Choi?</i></b>

775
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,830
Mr. President.

776
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:36,070
<i>I don't like how Assemblyman Jin works.</i>

777
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,330
I apologize but...

778
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,760
<i>I didn't call to scold you. It's just</i>

779
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,120
<i>that I was curious as
to how you were doing.</i>

780
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,380
Excuse me?

781
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,340
<i>I'm a bit envious of Assemblyman Jin.</i>

782
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:54,460
<i>How reassuring would it be to
have an aide like you beside me?</i>

783
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,560
You flatter me, Mr. President.

784
