00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,030
I think that the entire SOC
budget must be cut, and

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,090
the present $15 billion worth of
government bond issue needs to be reduced.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,030
<i>Deputy Prime Minister,
please state your opinion.</i>

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,420
Yes, Sunbae-nim?

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,290
I am a little disappointed
in you this time.

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,810
I am sorry that I didn't
tell you in advance.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,450
Didn't I tell you what is the
best for Assemblyman Jin?

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:47,310
<i>I am sorry but the best I
chose for him was this.</i>

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,550
Whose decision is right...

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,640
you will know little by little.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,860
I understand.

16

I will tell you my
position exactly.

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,280
If this committee
doesn't do what I said,

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,330
regardless of whether I belong
to the ruling party or not,

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,960
I will vote against the
supplementary budget bill.

- How was I?<br>- You
were the best!

32
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,700
Oh, really?

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,300

34
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,790
See me for a moment.

So scary...<br>What have I done?

38
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,900
I pleaded with you just to follow
the written questionnaire.

39
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,860
Oh... you're doing this because I said I
opposed the supplementary budget bill.

40
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,802
It was because the Deputy
Prime Minister kept beating

41
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:21,440
around the bush and not
saying things exactly...

42
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
I got hot under the collar and
said it in the heat of the moment.

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,910
How can you say whatever because
you're hot under the collar?

44
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,030
I didn't use foul language. I
just said what was on my mind.

45
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,790
As an assemblyman, can't I even
say such things as I wish?

46
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,470
You cannot do as you wish!<br>You should
have consulted with me first!

47
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,890
Am I a robot you operate...

48
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,110
- to consult with you about every
single thing?<br>- Then, what am I?

49
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,200
If you're going to do as you
wish, why do I have to be here?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,550
Okay, I understand. I won't
do this again in the future.

51
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,190
Now, how are you going to
cope with the aftermath?

52
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,880
What aftermath? Did I
do something wrong?

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,220
Yes, you've committed
a very huge wrong!

54
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,760
Ah, seriously.

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,520
Thinking this is boasting,

56
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,400
I wasn't going to say this.

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,780
But look at this now. "Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil Fighting!"<br>"You are cool."

58
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,743
"Brave Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil, I'm always rooting

59
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:25,350
for you." "I'll root
for you." "Fighting!"

60
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,270
"A true national assemblyman"...

61
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,450
The people's praises are no joke
because I voiced my conviction.

62
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,440
That is why you've
committed a wrong.

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,880
What are you talking about?

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,750
Assemblyman, you will now have to
retract that statement of conviction.

65
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,130
This is the most ludicrous experience
in my 12 years as an assemblyman.

66
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,820
We placed him to lead the
questions to increase the budget.

67
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,790
And what? He will absolutely oppose
it if the budget is not reduced?!

68
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,640
Secretary General Baek, how are you
going to bear responsibility for this?

69
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,890
No matter how ludicrous it was, you
should lay the blame at the correct door.

70
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,220
Complain to Assemblyman Jin,
not to Secretary General!

71
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,120
Assemblyman Jin is a newbie
here in the Pro-BH faction.

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,028
If a subordinate messes
up marketing, of course

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,000
the company president has
to take responsibility!

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,997
We thought he was on our side, too.
But he turns out to be

75
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,950
an X-man (UNPREDICTABLE PERSON).
What can we do about it?

76
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,430
- What?!<br>- Stop it already.

77
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,780
Where are you going in the middle of
a discussion?<br>Secretary General Baek!

78
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,110
Oh, that, that...

79
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,450
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil
has caused big trouble.

80
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,300
It will be resolved soon.

81
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,850
I will only rely on
you, Secretary General.

82
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:49,160
A lot of Anti-BH assemblymen are
anxiously waiting for the budget money.

83
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,670
You will have to give up on
increasing the SOC budget.

84
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,048
Due to Assemblyman Jin's questions,
the public have started to

85
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,450
take a bigger interest in the
size of the supplementary budget.

86
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,740
Secretary General Baek, I thought you
were a person who keeps promises.

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,530
No, I cannot allow that.

88
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,670
To ask for more
is stretching it.

89
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,050
- Enlarge it.<br>-
Assemblyman Park...

90
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,420
we don't have an assemblyman

91
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,360
who would demand an increase over the
amount the government has requested.

92
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
Secretary General Baek.

93
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,338
Creating something out of nothing
and making the impossible

94
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,670
possible... that is what the
really powerful can do.

95
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,610
Why don't you show me the power of the
most powerful one in our Gookmin Party?

96
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Excuse me.

97
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,456
Secretary General, the
Korean Democratic Party

98
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:02,930
held a planning meeting
and have decided

99
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,470
not to agree to the passage of the
SFC's supplementary budget bill.

100
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,720
I think their strategy is to put
it to a vote at the Committee.

101
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,100
What are the head counts of the ruling
and opposition party members on the SFC?

102
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,340
Including Chairman Kang Sang Ho,
our party has 2 more seats.

103
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,810
If Assemblyman Jin opposes, the
same numbers of yeses and noes...

104
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,010
It will fail to pass.

111
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,970
I already told him
that he was here...

112
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,860
Don't you have any wits about you?<br>Can't
you even make that kind of judgment call?

113
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,060
- I am sorry.<br>- You should be
more on your toes, really.

114
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,550
Give it to me.

115
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,230
Yes, Party Leader,
this is Jin Sang Pil.

116
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,843
- What?<br>- I was relieved

117
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,800

Assemblyman Jin's aide.

I'm sorry.

120

As for Assemblyman Jin,
he is inexperienced.

121
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,670
But you have learned the ropes
properly under Secretary General Baek.

122
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,930
What do you mean by aiding
an assemblyman this way?

123
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,730
But Party Leader, I don't
think this is right.

124
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,900
Why are you scolding
a blameless person?

125
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,820
It's inappropriate to include an
aide in an assemblymen's meeting.

126
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,450

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,440
When I was a layman, I really hated
politicians changing their words.

152
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,870
And how can I do it?

153
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,450
If your tongue has slipped,
then you should correct it.

154
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,570
How much did my tongue
really slip anyway?

155
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,290
I'm not saying I am
opposing it no matter what.

156
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,025
I'm saying we should reduce
useless expenses and reduce

157
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:03,490
the national debt. How is
that such a wrong thing?

158
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,350
Of course it's seriously wrong.

159
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,586
When the government wants to
work, insisting on cutting back

160
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,810
the budget... is that what a
ruling party member should do?!

161
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,872
If we are going to do
everything as the government

162
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:15,040
wants, then why are the
ruling party members elected?

163
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,245
Aren't the ruling party
members national assemblymen?

164
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:18,940
Aren't they the people's
representatives?

165
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,330
So impertinent. Who do you think
you're preaching to, huh?

166
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,940
A first term assemblyman
should put the party first!

167
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,660
Look here! What party (KOREAN
PRONUNCIATION: DANG)?!

168
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,050
Some Garden Balsam School Party? Are you
Maengoo?<br>(Bongsoongah Hakdang was a Gag

169
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,330
Concert program and Maengoo was a character
in the show, synonym for stupid)

170
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,920
What, you punk?!

171
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,460
Supreme Councilman
Choi, calm down.

172
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,060
Where do you think you are? A green guy
like you, saying such disrespectful things!

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,468
Are you saying, if you
don't retract and the

174
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,810
bill goes to a vote, you
will vote against it?

175
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,030
Yes.

176
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,047
You cannot do this to the party
leader's face. Apologize

177
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,910
quickly and say that you
will carefully consider it.

178
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,750
I don't want to.

179
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,280
I got it. I got it, so leave.

180
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,380
Leave here right now!

181
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,810
I'll leave.

182
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:14,640
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki</i>

183
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,420
What happened?

184
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,760
Just do whatever you want! Do you
think I will leave you alone?!

185
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,010
Didn't you seen my text message?

186
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,150
My personality doesn't allow
me to say what I don't mean.

187
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,090
Sorry.

188
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,340
You have the face of a person
with badly hurt pride.

189
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,950
Enough is enough.

190
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,480
I am more mad at you
than at Assemblyman Jin.

191
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,958
Do you know how much Secretary
General Baek suffered

192
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,460
from the Blue House today
because of Assemblyman Jin?

193
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,280
Conduct yourself properly.

194
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,250
The President's Senior Secretary for
Economic Affairs has called again.

195
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,013
He said the VIP was enraged
and wants the situation

196
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,320
taken care of as
expeditiously as possible.

197
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,930
I think you will personally have
to persuade Assemblyman Jin.

198
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,893
<i>The stock market, that had been
on the rise for the past few</i>

199
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:39,930
<i>days due to the expectation of
a supplementary budget, fell.</i>

200
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,114
<i>Until noon, stocks that could
benefit from the extra budget,</i>

201
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,070
<i>including construction stocks,
led the upmarket trend.</i>

202
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,323
<i>But after Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil's opposition</i>

203
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:48,270
<i>statement, feeling
increasingly insecure,</i>

204
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,060
<i>the market sharply declined.</i>

205
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,535
<i>In the event the budget bill review
continues to face difficulties</i>

206
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:55,700
<i>in the Assembly, related
industries including construction</i>

207
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,400
<i>are expected to
suffer huge blows.</i>

208
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,950
<i>Opinions from Industries
Affected by Extra Budget Bill</i>

209
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,390
I don't want to see
them face to face.

210
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,647
Are you telling me to just
send away the industry

211
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:04,030
representatives who have come
all this way to see you?

212
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,750
So I have read this.
Isn't that enough?

213
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,640
The assemblyman said he would seriously
review the contents of the opinions.

214
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,830
How about seeing him?

215
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,140
I am sorry. He wants to organize his
thoughts more before meeting with you.

216
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,510
Is he refusing to meet with us?

217
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,660
If he plays it like this, his
next election will be difficult.

218
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,570
What is going on?

219
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,310
Secretary General.

220
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,540
Is Assemblyman Jin in?

221
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,527
As a ripple effect of your
statement, the passage of

222
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,220
the supplementary budget
bill has become unclear.

223
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,852
Not to mention that the
Blue House, the government

224
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:55,560
agencies, and related
industries are all in a panic.

225
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,040
That is how dangerous a
politician's words can be.

226
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,880
At a carelessly tossed
word, the world is rocked.

227
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,390
Then, are you saying a politician
shouldn't voice his own conviction?

228
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,670
A politician's words must hold one
more thing besides conviction.

229
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,590
A margin left for compromise.

230
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,980
Well, you talk smoothly but what you
mean is to leave a hole to back out.

231
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,300
Like a coward.

232
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,820
The essence of politics
is compromise.

233
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:33,720
Meeting the opponent's margin somewhere
inside your own margin... that is politics.

234
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,050
It is about time that you follow
the Party's position now.

235
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,420
Then, slash the budget. I
will agree to it, then.

236
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,350
That's impossible.

237
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,930
- Then, I can't change my position
either.<br>- Assemblyman Jin!

238
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,260
Stop just saying "impossible" and talk
to the government to reduce the budget.

239
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,970
That's all the citizens' debt.

240
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,675
Do as the Secretary General says.
What you are

241
00:15:56,687 --> 00:15:58,440
showing right now is not
conviction but conceit.

242
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,230
It's not conceit but certainty.
Certainty that I am right.

243
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,310
- Assemblyman Jin.<br>- In
Kyung, you stay out of this.

244
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,680
I think I have told you before.<br>There
is no correct answer in politics.

245
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,730
Even if there is no correct answer,
there can be incorrect answers.

246
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,712
As for me, I am certain
that what you are

247
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:22,860
asking for right now is
an incorrect answer!

248
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,000
Sunbae-nim!

249
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,920
Sunbae-nim, wait.

250
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,880
I will persuade him somehow.

251
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,770
Do you still think that you
made the right judgment?

252
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,080
I think I did what I ought
to have done as a secretary.

253
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,660
You gave courage to an incompetent leader.
You did what a secretary ought not do.

254
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,200
Assemblyman Jin will receive severe
disciplinary sanctions from the Party.

255
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,740
Sunbae-nim! Sunbae-nim!

256
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,920
<i>Gookmin Party's leadership is reportedly
planning severe disciplinary sanctions</i>

257
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,120
<i>against Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil, who has
opposed the supplementary budget bill.</i>

Jeong Soo<br>As the Party Leader,</i>

259

260
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,336

262
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,390
<i>the public attention is on Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil's next move.</i>

263
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,910
<i>Next news...</i>

264
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,579
Will you adhere to your
position even if you

265
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:51,310
receive disciplinary
sanctions from the Party?

266
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,910
Yes.

267
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,745
About the point that your
opposition statement

268
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,250
is negatively affecting
the economy...

269
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,790
I do not think so.

270
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,990
I think our old man
is a bit cool.

271
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,270
What?

272
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,850
Frankly, our old man totally
pissed and ticked me off.

273
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,400
But watching him fight, with his
conviction, he just looks cool, you know.

274
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,060
- He will change.<br>- What?

275
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,330
That conviction will
change, for sure.

276
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,010
You worked hard. Yes.

277
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,675
- Assemblyman says he
continues to oppose.<br>-

278
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:33,260
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil
continues to oppose.

279
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,280
Shouldn't we all go in there and
intervene with the assemblyman?

280
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,190
When he doesn't even listen to Secretary
General Baek,<br>would he listen to us?

281
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,030
Go home, everyone.

282
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,180
Why? Why is the mood
like this in the room?

283
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,714
Assemblyman, with all due
respect, may I offer

284
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,650
you a word of bitter
(BUT HELPFUL) counsel?

285
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,550
No, you don't have to offer
a word of bitter counsel.

286
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,870
Okay.

287
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,890
Sang Pil!

288
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,680
I mean, Assemblyman, is it true that
you will receive disciplinary actions?

289
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,910
Not yet, but if he opposes the bill in
the next meeting,<br>then that will happen.

290
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,620
- Come with me.<br>- Go where?

291
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,090
- Hospital. Let's go quickly.<br>- Why
go to a hospital all of a sudden?

292
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,230
Let's split open your tummy and
at least get out the appendix.

293
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,430
What are you talking about?

294
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,860
You don't have to go to the next meeting
if you're hospitalized.<br>Hurry, let's go!

295
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,730
When I was enlisted, I
already got an appendectomy.

296
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,080
You don't have an appendix?

297
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,890
What happened with your trip to Gyeongjae
City? Have you met Department Head Oh?

298
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,310
No, I didn't get to see
Ae Ri at all.<br>Then,

299
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:58,340
you don't have any
gall bladder either?

300
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,300
Should we, then, get your
liver chopped a little bit?

301
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,490
Aigoo, really, enough! Really!

302
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,710

303
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,810
Yes.

00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,570
<i>Resignation and Acceptance</i>

305
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,670
What is this?

306
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,897
- It is a paper agreeing to the
resignation and acceptance

307
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:23,040
of positions.<br>- What is
resignation and acceptance?

308
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,100
The party floor leader will
change your standing committees.

309
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,600
If you put your seal to it, I
will take care of the rest.

310
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,850
Are you telling me now to run from
the SFC to another committee?

311
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,669
Running or not, this is the
only solution to avoid

312
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:42,400
disciplinary action without
changing your stance.

313
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:49,370
How can this be the only solution?
It's just a sneaky move, sneaky.

314
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,430
People will laugh
at me even more.

315
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,500
Will you accept disciplinary sanctions
because you're afraid of being laughed at?

316
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,480
Aide Choi.

317
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,094
I will really, from the
next time on, consult

318
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:02,420
with you about everything
except breathing.

319
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,490
So please just this once, just this
once, give me your understanding.

320
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,230
From the next time on?

321
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,820
From the next time? From the
next time on, what will you do?

322
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,560
- What?<br>- A first term
assemblyman, ostracized by his

323
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,140
party and subjected to heavy
disciplinary action...

324
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,840
I don't know what on
earth such a man can do.

325
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,180
If you do not put your seal here, there
is no next time for you, Assemblyman.

326
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,900
Ai, just a minute!

327
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,170
Why don't you let this
go before speaking?

328
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,490
Why won't I be able
to do anything, huh?

329
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,680
When there are so many people
praising me over the Internet!

330
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,010
What did I do wrong to
be able to do nothing?

331
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,980
I will give you an
example of legislation.

332
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,554
Even for a bill to be
introduced to the floor, ten

333
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:58,050
assemblymen have to put
their seals to that bill.

334
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,531
In order for a bill to be
enacted into law, among the

335
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:02,990
hundreds of assemblymen
present in the assembly hall,

336
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,230
a majority must approve. But

337
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,030
whom do you have beside you?

338
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:18,840
I am telling you clearly. Assemblyman, you
will not be able to leave any achievement.

340
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,630
Hey, hey...

341
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,340
- That's Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil, right?<br>- Yes.

342
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,780
I heard that he would be reprimanded.<br>I
guess he's here to drown his sorrow.

343
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,290
Aigoo...

344
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,350
What's up with this
kid, Jin Joo Hee?

345
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,990
Hey, rascal!

346
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,810
- Daddy!<br>- Hey, rascal...
You're here?

347
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,650
- A surprise, right?<br>-
Hey, when did you come?

348
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,980
- A while ago.<br>-
Wow, my rascal...

349
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,050
- Wow, you've become really pretty,
huh?<br>- Ugh, this alcohol smell...

350
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,800
- Did you drink?<br>-
No, I didn't.

351
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,860
You did drink too! Ugh!

352
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,500
I didn't drink.

353
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,280
Wow, the view is totally cool.

354
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,490
Right? Huh? Really cool...

355
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:45,950
Hey, your daddy works there.
Don't underestimate me.

356
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,720
Should I become an
assemblywoman too, later?

357
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,040
Wow, if my Joo Hee becomes
an assemblywoman...

358
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,220
it would be a rascal assemblywoman,
rascal...<br>Ruined. What should I do?

359
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,440
- Daddy, are you okay?<br>- Huh?

360
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,960
- About what?<br>- You were number 1 on the
search engines all day long today.

361
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,960
Oh, so you came because you
were worried about me?

362
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,030
Not worrying, but just...

363
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:23,740
- do well.<br>- You did come
because you were worried, too.

364
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,900
Hey, do you even know
what assemblymen do?

365
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,390
I am no less than a
middle schooler.

366
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,230
They are people who make laws.

367
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,850
- Lawmaker.<br>- Wow!

368
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,070
Did you come after studying this?
Wow, Jin Joo Hee.

369
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,970
- Daddy, can you make
this kind of law?<br>- What?

370
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,277
-A law for 6 months'
school and 6 months'

371
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:50,160
vacation.<br>- Really, you are...
in that respect...

372
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,690
Hey, I'm going to make a law
for school all year round.

373
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,700
But can you really make any
law you intend to make?

374
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,590
Hey, of course, your daddy is a national
assemblyman. What law can't I make?

375
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:08,040
I can make it all. Hey, all of
this, your daddy... makes it.

376
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,720
<i>I am telling you clearly.</i>

377
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,120
<i>Assemblyman, you will not be
able to leave any achievement.</i>

378
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,360
Daddy will make it all.
I must...

379
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,390
- What's wrong?<br>- Huh?

380
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,630
No,

381
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,530
it's because Joo Hee comes here
personally to comfort her daddy,

382
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,649
I am so moved. You're
all grown up now.<br>When

383
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,140
did you finish growing
up, my Joo Hee?

384
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,070
How dare you... the head of Na Rae
Girls' Middle School's best student?

385
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,290
The head of Na Rae
Girls' Middle School's

386
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:47,640
best student... Dad
touches it as he wishes.

387
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,480
This won't do. Want to fight?
You, in?

388
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,690
In!

389
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,120
- Bring it on! Bring
it on.<br>- As they say,

390
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,790
As they say, enemies come face
to face on a single log bridge.

391
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,080
Kicking attack!

392
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,760
Take my welding technique!
Scorch, scorch...

393
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,700
<i>As for me, I am certain that what
you are asking for right now</i>

394
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,610
<i>is an incorrect answer!</i>

395
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,320
<i>Yes, Secretary General.</i>

396
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,550
Please set up individual meetings with
the Party Ethics Committee members.

397
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,960
Is it for Assemblyman Jin's
disciplinary actions?

398
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,851
Tell them in advance that
the severity I require

399
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:48,970
is suspension of his
membership rights.

400
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,450
The duration is to be a
minimum of one year.

401
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,340
But, Secretary General,

402
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,932
if his membership is suspended for a
year, Assemblyman Jin will not be

403
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:59,650
able to apply for a party nomination
in the next year's general election.

404
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,860
Some may say it is too harsh.

405
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,420
Assemblyman Jin has overstepped
the margin of forgivable error.

406
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,480
<i>But can you really make any
law you intend to make?</i>

407
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,280
<i>Hey, of course, your daddy is a national
assemblyman. What law can't I make?</i>

408
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,414
<i>A first term assemblyman, ostracized
by his party and subjected to heavy</i>

409
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,270
<i>disciplinary action, I don't know
what on earth such a man can do.</i>

410
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,570
<i>If you do not put
your seal here,</i>

411
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,660
<i>there is no next time
for you, Assemblyman.</i>

412
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,565
<i>Running or not, this is the
only solution to avoid</i>

413
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:57,380
<i>disciplinary action without
changing your stance.</i>

414
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,040
Yes, Assemblyman.

415
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,950
If I do that resignation
and acceptance thing,

416
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,250
can I continue to do
what I want to do?

417
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,270
At least, you will
have an opportunity.

418
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,090
How you avail yourself
of that opportunity...

419
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,680
is yours to figure out.

420
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,430
You will continue
to help me, right?

421
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,710
Yes.

422
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,460
Resignation and acceptance...

423
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,620
I will put my stamp on it.

424
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,490
<i>Jin Sang Pil</i>

425
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,730
I am a little late.

426
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,800
Isn't Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil here?

427
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,160
- Can't you see for yourself?<br>- Did
you perhaps lock him up somewhere?

428
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,050
The way you talk,
really pathetic...

429
00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:01,060
Yes, we've kidnapped him and as we speak,
a hole in the ground is being dug.

430
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:06,370
But Assemblyman Jo, are you really
going to put it to a vote today?

431
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,554
Of course we should.
Legislative Assistants, what

432
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:12,570
are you doing? Go find
Assemblyman Jin quickly!

433
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,960
No need for that.

434
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,950
What brings you here,
Assemblyman Park?

435
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,500
Would an assemblyman come to a
meeting to play the game of Go Stop?

436
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,151
Starting today, Assemblyman
Park has resigned

437
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:39,740
from the Environment
and Labor Committee

438
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,380
and accepted a seat on our SFC.

439
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,090
What are you doing, not removing
that name plate quickly?

440
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,710
<i>Jin Sang Pil</i>

441
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,830
Our SFC people, you all
look so bright-eyed, huh?

442
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:15,520
Now, let's start the discussion. We have
to be discussing to earn our salary.

443
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,770
We got stabbed in the back
by Jin Sang Pil again.

444
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,830
Now, then, everyone,
settle down.

445
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,620
Since we have a quorum today...

446
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,430
Assemblyman Jin!

447
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,540
Aigoo, Assemblywoman Cheon.

448
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,430
I was wondering why you were
showing some potential...

449
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,540
But in the end, you've tucked
your tail, haven't you?

450
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,940
Yes, I don't have a face
which can look at you.

451
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,160
A face? Did you have any
face to begin with?

452
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:59,930
Mr. Bae Dal Soo is looking down
from heaven.<br>Be ashamed of yourself.

453
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,800
The supplementary budget bill has just
passed the SFC without any issues.

454
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,970
Whew.

455
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,870
What should I do about the disciplinary
action against Assemblyman Jin?

456
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,550
We should cancel it. Notify the
Party Ethics Committee members.

457
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,180
Yes.

458
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,320
But was there any need to send even
Assemblyman Park Choon Seob to the SFC?

459
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,730
If even Park Choon Seob is on the SFC, it
will be very uncomfortable in the future.

460
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:37,020
I had no other way.

461
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,570
I gave him a seat on the SFC so he
would give up an increased SOC budget.

462
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,600
That Jin Sang Pil
person, really...

463
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,200
Yes, because of my
foolish mistake

464
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,640
to the party and the elders
of the party leadership

465
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,220
I have caused distress.

466
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,590
I sincerely apologize.

467
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,360
In the future, things like
this will never happen again.

468
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,790
If I do it again, then I'm a real
scoundrel, really. I am sorry.

469
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,960
Please make me an appointment with
Secretary General Baek some time.

470
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:38,370
Why are your expressions like
that again, like you're angry?

471
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:42,130
About the Supreme Council, you could
have just sat down and said a few words.

472
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,370
Why did you have to enact
such a humiliating scene?

473
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,708
To get petted by them a little.
You said I wouldn't

474
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,070
be able to do anything if I
am branded by the party.

475
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,730
Why are you all or nothing, polar
opposites in every situation?

476
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,760
Because I am a welder,
a flame-like guy.

477
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,390
Scorch, scorch. Clang, clang.

00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,190
Aren't you going to eat?

498
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,030
Department Head Oh!

499
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,352
It seemed like you were
going to do something

500
00:35:52,364 --> 00:35:55,240
for a while, but you've
completely surrendered.

501
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,730
Why did you do that?
Did you get scared?

502
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,360
Yes, I completely got scared.

503
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,180
But are you here to ask me that?

504
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,360
Let me just ask you one thing.

505
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,490
I have seen you destroying the Deputy
Prime Minister on the Assembly TV.

506
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,610
You even watch those things?

507
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,910
What you said then...
did you really mean it?

508
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,850
Of course.

509
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,880
Did you hire an
administrative secretary?

510
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,320
No, not yet.

511
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:47,320
Assemblyman Jin, from now
on, call me Secretary Oh.

512
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,430
Aigo.

513
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,600
I will do my best to assist you.

514
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,750
Thank you, Department Head Oh.

515
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,670
Everyone, please say hi
to our Secretary Oh.

516
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,960
Should we give her a round of applause?
Applause? Applause!

517
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,320
Aigoo, that won't work!

518
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,050
We've never lived in basement
apartments so we can't handle it.

519
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,500
What? A rooftop room? You're
driving me crazy, really.

520
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,870
Hot in summer and
cold in winter.

521
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,515
And when birds come and
shit on the rooftop,

522
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:24,770
that stench will knock
you dead, dead!

523
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,820
Try smelling it in summer. What?

524
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,110
At any rate, please scour
more and look into it, okay?

525
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,380
What? Okay.

526
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,720
Ahew, darn it!

527
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,380
Hyung, let's stop nitpicking
and just live anywhere.

528
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:50,320
Assemblyman Jin, I
have a favor to ask.

529
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,510
Please ask the police
to find Ae Ri.

530
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,530
Aigoo, it's okay.

531
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:02,480
Okay, what is okay? I cannot sleep at
night because I'm so worried about Ae Ri.

532
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,670
What do you mean you can't sleep? You
are only too good at snoring away.

533
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,880
Just hurry and go out
to the secretary area.

534
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:11,990
Mr. Assemblyman Jin!

535
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,430
- Aigoo, why are you doing this, making my
flesh crawl.<br>- Hey, Mr. Assemblyman Jin!

536
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,420
I understand, so go out there.
Go out there and see.

537
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,790
Eh, you weasel.

538
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,320
After Ae Ri was
so good to you...

539
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,960
Assemblyman.

540
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,450
Made me so surprised...
All Right!

541
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,720
W-What was that?

542
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,030
I've brought your
instant coffee.

543
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,120
Ae Ri!

544
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,490
Please! Please call
me Secretary Oh.

545
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:02,360
I won't let you alone if you
make a scene before other staff.

546
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,300
Okay... Why are you
doing this, really!

547
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,420
Really? We can use
that place for free?

548
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,210
Wow, thank you, friend! Yes.

549
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,900
Everyone's been working so hard.<br>Let's
eat out together today, okay?

550
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,700
Ohhh!!! Thank you!!!

551
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,880
Assemblyman, I have found the
house for you to live in.

552
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,030
Oh, really?

553
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,810
Yes.

554
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,740
Let me taste this one.

555
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,190
Oh, no. I thought we would have the fun
of doing karaoke after a long time.

556
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:09,680
After all, this assembly
office doesn't suit my taste.

557
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,420
Aigoo. Endure for 1 year.
As long as you endure,

558
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,361
you can transfer to the
office of the Ministry of

559
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,560
National Defense or any office
of the National Assembly.

560
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,400
Wow, amazing! Amazing!

561
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,120
Wow! Look at this!

562
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,400
So, for this place...

563
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,900
We pay a little bit of monthly rent
and live here. It's almost free.

564
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,037
This is my friend's guest house.
Her husband got

565
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:33,110
to go for a year's
sabbatical leave to the USA.

566
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:38,990
However, if you break or damage something,
you will be expelled from here.

567
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:43,190
Aihew! Don't worry about it.
It's so cool!

568
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,090
It's magnificent.

569
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,630
Well! For the servants called by the
people! Cheer for the Assembly office!

570
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:59,220
Cheer for the Assembly office!

571
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:09,290
Assembly office... Really...

572
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,090
Have some of this.

573
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,210
Have a lot.

574
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,030
You said it couldn't be better?

575
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,190
Yeah...

576
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,780
It's good.

577
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,640
From now on, Assemblyman Jin
will not sleep in the office.

578
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,880
We don't have to try to figure
out when we can go home, right?

579
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,740
Secretary Kim, how is it for you
working at the Assembly office?

580
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,940
It's as I expected.

581
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,390
How did you expect?

582
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,210
The dumping ground where
the human trash lives.

583
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,690
Pardon?

584
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,990
It's a joke.

585
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,310
What did you say?

586
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,250
I was joking.

587
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,400
It's really a joke.

588
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,070
This is Assemblyman
Jin's office.

589
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:43,867
We are trying to arrange
a meal time between

590
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:46,750
the Secretary General and
our Assemblyman Jin.

591
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,280
Would you let us know
when he is free?

592
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,800
<i> He doesn't have any free time.</i>

593
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,930
Ah, yes ―

594
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,030
Hello?

595
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,740
Ahh. This wench! How arrogant!

596
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:07,200
Aide Choi, she told me Secretary
General doesn't have any free time.

597
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:19,960
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki</i>

598
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:23,460
Hello, Secretary General!

599
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,090
I tried several times
to meet with you.

600
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,270
Oh, well. It happens
that I meet you here.

601
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,740
I have an informal gathering.
I have to leave.

602
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,870
Aigoo! Really! Our
Secretary General!

603
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,650
Really.

604
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,940
Unexpectedly, you
have a long grudge.

605
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,050
I will offer one
piece of advice.

606
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,900
Lay low and exercise more
self-control in the future.

607
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,310
Aigoo. Take out your anger.

608
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,900
It's all in the past, and
I apologized before.

609
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,730
The warning when you
became the assemblyman,

610
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,490
don't you remember that?

611
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:12,080
I never give my understanding
to someone twice.

612
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,230
Oh well, Secr...

613
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,600
Excuse me. I have
another engagement.

614
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,550
Farewell!

615
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,660
- See you next time.<br>- Yes.

616
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,020
Sunbae-nim!

617
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,030
I am sorry.

618
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:54,530
Sunbae-nim. I should have known
beforehand that you are uncomfortable.

619
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,410
I thought, for my own self-comfort,
that you would understand us.

620
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,930
I understood immediately.

621
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,260
But Assemblyman Jin put our party
into a critical situation twice.

622
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,960
If I forgive such a person,

623
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,930
I will not be able
to control other

624
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:15,530
assemblymen's unpredictable
acts in the future.

625
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,570
Then...

626
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:21,440
you mean you are going to
break with Assemblyman Jin?

627
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,670
I have another engagement.
I have to leave.

628
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,430
Assemblyman Jin...

629
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,978
made a big decision in his
own way to accept the

630
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,310
withdrawal from the SFC and
transfer to another committee.

631
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:41,410
I wish Sunbae-nim would show
your generosity to him.

632
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,060
Work hard.

633
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,760
Even though it may take some time, we can
persuade him. So don't worry too much.

634
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,610
Yes.

635
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:03,840
Then, Aide Choi, you
take care of me well.

636
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,570
Yes.

637
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,870
Hello?

638
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,600
<i> Are you Assemblyman Jin?</i>

639
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,220
Yes. That's right.

640
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,550
<i> I am Park Choon Seob.</i>

641
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,090
In the meantime, you
have had a hard time.

642
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,280
No. It was okay. I didn't
have a very hard time.

643
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,730
The person who cleans the windows
has a chance to break the window.

644
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,770
When you tried your best, it happened.
So never be discouraged by it.

645
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,840
Ah. Yes. Thank you.

646
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:00,600
By the way, why did
you want to see me?

647
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,320
When a person meets a person and they eat a
meal together, do we have to have a reason?

648
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,230
Ah, yes. That's right.

649
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,330
However...

650
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,980
a man who does politics
is a little different.

651
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:17,930
Yes?

652
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:24,780
When I was a newbie, most politics was done
at the drinking table in the gisaeng house.

653
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,580
These days, it's done
at the dinner table.

654
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,370
By the way...

655
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:41,350
I can't understand well if
you beat around the bush.

656
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,460
And I have a tendency to
interpret things in my own way.

657
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:50,870
Do you mean whether you have
an agenda for me or not?

658
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,470
Assemblyman Jin.

659
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,120
I will ask you briefly
and directly.

660
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,290
Where do you belong?

661
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,740
Of course, I am
in Gookmin Party.

662
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,110
Not the party.

663
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,860
Within the party... Yes?

664
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,080
I thought you were a newbie
in the Pro-BH faction.

665
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,810
But you seem to be an unrestricted
free agent. That's why I am asking.

666
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,000
Well... for me...

667
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:29,380
Should we have to belong
to this kind of faction?

668
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,510
Politics looks
complicated, but...

669
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,930
in the end, it's a fight
over head counts.

670
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:40,470
In the large fight, party versus party, and
in the small fight, faction versus faction.

671
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:45,690
Without factions,
politics can't exist.

672
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:50,760
Are you trying to
recruit me right now?

673
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,160
Today...

674
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,530
I just came to encourage the
junior who had a hard time.

675
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,430
With this...

676
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,080
treat your employees to dinners.

677
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,230
Oh. You can't do that.

678
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:20,030
The Assembly's etiquette is not
different from the world's etiquette.

679
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,840
If the senior gives you
something, you just accept it.

680
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,260
Let's eat.

681
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,040
Yes.

682
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,450
Secretary Oh. Where did
Assemblyman Jin go?

683
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:49,470
Yes. A while ago, he left
for a lunch appointment.

684
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,710
That was not in his schedule.

685
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:54,450
Secretary Kim, try to find out
where Assemblyman Jin is.

686
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,710
Kim Gyu Hwan?

687
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,010
Kim Gyu Hwan!

688
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,640
I am sorry.

689
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,480
Because of Secretary Kim's
swimming in the morning,

690
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,920
he is not himself these days.

691
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,014
Kim Gyu Hwan! Go to
the front of the main

692
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:35,950
building of the National
Assembly and call me.

693
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,020
What?

694
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,024
I told you to go to the
front of the main building

695
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,170
of the <br>National Assembly and call me!
Run quickly!

696
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,820
Okay.

697
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,950
Aide Choi. I am here.

698
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,190
I will give you 20 seconds to
run around the building. Run.

699
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,250
- I ran around the
building.<br>- How many?

700
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,960
- What do you mean?<br>- Run
again for 20 seconds.

701
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:52,720
Wow...

702
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,050
It is not better
than the dog-drills.

703
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:01,070
What does she mean how many?

704
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,630
Although I ran around again,
I don't understand yet.

705
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,460
Again for 20 seconds! Run!

706
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:31,040
Oh, I can't watch.

707
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,040
Run!

708
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,540
Run.

709
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,020
Run!

710
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,500
Run!... Run!

711
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,950
RUN!

712
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,250
Run!

713
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,590
<i> Run!</i>

714
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,170
<i>(FROM SONG SO MIN) The number of pillars
surrounding the main Assembly building!!!!</i>

715
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,260
It's 24.

716
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,330
I will give you 5 minutes. Come back
after finding out how many lights are in

717
00:53:59,342 --> 00:54:01,930
the ceiling of the main Assembly building
by asking at the management office.

718
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,420
Secretary Kim, are you okay?

719
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,720
Where is Aide Choi?

720
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,500
She is in the conference room.

721
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,990
It's been 4 minutes and 32 seconds.
How many?

722
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:36,510
It's 365.

723
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,540
Sit.

724
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,963
The 24 pillars surrounding the
main building represent 24

725
00:54:55,975 --> 00:54:57,760
solar terms (4 SEASONS AND EACH
SEASON HAS 6 SOLAR PERIODS).

726
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,920
The 365 lights in the
ceiling represent 365 days.

727
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,510
This means to work hard for the people
all 365 days a year without idling.

728
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:11,300
By the way, during your working hours,
you dared to allow your mind to wander?

729
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,180
I'm sorry.

730
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,050
If this happens one more
time, I will let you go.

731
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,450
Know that.

732
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,400
Yes? Aide Choi!

733
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,520
I have something to ask.

734
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,150
- What is it?<br>- I want to know the
reason why you don't like me.

735
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,260
It is not that I don't like you.

736
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,110
It's that you are not
a kid who fits here.

737
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:36,550
Why do you think that?

738
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:40,520
Last time, you told Da Jeong that the
National Assembly is a dumping ground.

739
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,500
I know that wasn't a joke.

740
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,180
That's really your misunderstanding.
I drank too much on that day.

741
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,080
Then, it's a more
serious matter.

742
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,980
To kid who speaks a blunt
remark when drunk,

743
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,590
we can't let him assist an assemblyman.

744
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,170
Keep your head straight.
You have only one chance.

745
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,920
Hyung, here.

746
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,980
Why are you giving this kind
of stuff, Assemblyman Jin?

747
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,690
I will spend it well.

748
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:34,230
Ask Administrative Secretary Oh to
use it to help the needy neighbors.

749
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,040
Okay.

750
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,250
Yes?

751
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:45,650
It is hard to join Assemblyman Kim
Hyung Joon's Research Committee.

752
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:48,410
- Why? <br> - They are full.

753
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:52,140
You are not the kind of person
who doesn't check those matters.

754
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,250
They try to read Secretary
General Baek's mind.

755
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:00,600
Even though you feel frustrated,
take it easy and be patient.

756
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,550
That is the best right now.

757
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:04,920
I understand. Hang up, please.

758
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,800
What is? Baek Do Hyeon blocked you again?

759
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,860
Yes.

760
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:18,010
Aicham! What should we do?

761
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:22,640
When you are marked down, why are you
marked down by the head of the party?

762
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,780
Can you work well if you are treated so?

763
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,640
I don't know, either.

764
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,970
<i> Stop the oppression of the laborers!</i>

765
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:33,040
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

766
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,340
<i> Stop the oppression of the laborers!</i>

767
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,390
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

768
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,580
<i> Stop the oppression of the laborers!</i>

769
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,650
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

770
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,450
<i> Stop the oppression of the laborers!</i>

771
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:45,760
Aigoo, Aicham! They
are having a hard

772
00:57:45,772 --> 00:57:48,460
time on this hot day.<br>- <i>Stop it!
Stop it!</i>

773
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:54,250
Assemblyman Jin, there are a lot
of pitiful people in Korea.

774
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,220
<i>Politics looks complicated, but...</i>

775
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,630
<i>in the end, it's a fight over head counts.</i>

776
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:07,340
<i>Without factions, politics can't exist.</i>

777
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,890
Turn the car around.

778
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,970
- What did you say?<br>
- I said to turn the car around.

779
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,620
Oh...yes.

780
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,130
I told you not to...

781
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,790
I came here to tell you something.

782
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:43,180
I am sorry. I told him he would
not be able to meet you.

783
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,400
Chief Lim, go outside.

784
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,680
What is your business?

785
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,630
From now on...

786
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,930
for you and the Pro-BH faction...

787
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,180
I will do anything.

788
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,030
I came here to tell you
that I am determined.

789
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,770
Leave.

790
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:31,260
For my past transgressions...

791
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,640
please forgive me.

792
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,810
Right... right now, what are you doing?

793
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:49,240
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
