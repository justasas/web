10
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,500
You should sit down first.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,650
Is this the last task
assigned to you, Aide Choi?

12
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,540
This is a misunderstanding.

13
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,070
I will explain.

14
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,750
No. I have nothing to say so go outside.

What is it that you want?

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,870
When you made the strategic
nomination to pick me, did

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,300
you do it so that you can
run in Gyeongjae district?

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,360
When you said that I should go to the
Assembly and represent the weak...

20
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,710
was it all bullsh*t?

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,690
Why don't you tell me quickly?

22
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:49,800

-What?<b>-Take a look at yourself.</b>

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,020
On the body where you once wore
a vest while demonstrating,

25
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,390
now, you are wearing a
golden badge on a suit.

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,160
-So what?<b>-Regardless of whether
it was a conspiracy or not,</b>

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,860

Dal Soo Hyung died, okay?

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,260
Because of your shit*y
ploy, Dal Soo Hyung died.

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,870
If you insist on finding the
reason why Bae Dal Soo died,

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,710
it's because you accepted my offer.

34
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,780
Go and think about why you are in
this position and think about that.

35
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,780
You must be thinking about my
withdrawing from being a candidate.

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,870
Wishful thinking on your part.

37
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,040
I am not forcing you.

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:09,640
Just as last time, the choice
is up to you, Assemblyman Jin.

39
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,840
Listen carefully.

40
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,080
Even if I am a person who lacks things,

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,660
I am not going let things
happen as you wish.

However, as your Aide, on my honor,

46
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,680
I did not do anything
that violated that role.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,910
Aide Choi, you knew, right?

48
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,350
What?

49
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,860
The reason that he
strategically nominated me.

50
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,980
Why can't you answer?

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,470
That matter happened before I
started to serve you as an Aide.

52
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,950
So you didn't know?

53
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,690
Just tell me honestly...

54
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,050
that you can't tell me because you are
on Secretary General Baek's side.

55
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,130
You didn't tell me because
you are on his side!

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,500
Yes, I knew. Is that enough?

57
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,030
Now do you feel better
after spitting that out?

58
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,590
Yes, I do.

59
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:16,670
Knowing that, in spite of that
you've been playing with me.

60
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,990
Right? Was it fun seeing me do
whatever you told me to do?

61
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,600
Fun? Is it fun to suffer in silence?

62
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,240
Do you have the slightest idea how I feel?

63
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Because I thought you were having such
a tough time, I couldn't say anything.

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,970
I was hoping you would
always remain unaware.

65
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,580
Nevertheless, no matter what you say...

66
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,920

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,660
That tactic... it will fail.

171
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,840
Because I will continue to remain here.

172
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,460
Well, would Assemblyman Jin be
able to continue to trust you?

173
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,420
He will.

174
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,580
If I have not judged him
wrongly, for sure he will.

175
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,110
Choi In Kyung, come to grips with it.

176
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,090
No matter how hard you struggle,
you won't be able to beat me.

177
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,130
We've never fought properly.

178
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:35,520
The result will be different
from what you expect.

179
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,430
<i>1. Is Aide Choi 0 0 (FEMALE) at
Assemblyman J's Office DH's Mole?</i>

180
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,720
<i>2. To offer the district of Gyeongjae
City to DH, a political guardian of Choi,</i>

181
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,030
<i>she works at J's office on daytime, and
at night she stays at the side of DH...</i>

182
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,810
Which newspaper carried this article?

183
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,690
Not a newspaper, but

184
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,390
it's called a scandal sheet.

185
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,890
What is Aide Choi going to do now?
Should you fire her?

186
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,330
This is just a wild rumor.

187
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,990
- Aide Choi is absolutely not
that kind of person.<b>- Hey,</b>

188
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,330
I don't want to talk behind
Aide Choi's back, either.

189
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,860
But what Ae Ri said
yesterday does make sense.

190
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,620
Frankly, in this situation,
there is no reason for

191
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,080
Aide Choi to be all loyal
to Assemblyman Jin.

192
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,060
Right?

193
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,220
But why are these people not here yet? Huh?

194
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,170
Assemblyman Jin!

195
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,250
Oh, yes, Chairman.

196
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,150
Forget about today's meeting.

197
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,130
But why?

198
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,610
The members say they are
busy and cannot attend.

199
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,890
What?Since when was this scheduled that
they are pretending to be busy only now?

200
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,690
- Ah, well... <b> -It's so obvious.</b>

201
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,410
They must have gone to
Baek Do Hyeon's fan club.

202
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,570
If only you had made confirmation
calls to these people,

203
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,990
the Assemblyman would not
have wasted his trip.

204
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,120
How can you do such lax jobs?

205
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,100
I am sorry.

206
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,280
Please make sure that
this never happens again.

207
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,980
But, Aide Choi,

208
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,980
are you asking us to keep
doing this nonsense?

209
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,120
What do you mean, nonsense?

210
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,680
This is not an election time. How
can we keep doing this every day?

211
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,450
Even if we do this, the popular
opinion will not turn back, you know?

212
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,190
Aide Seo...

213
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,930
Aide Seo. Is that something
an aide should say?

214
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,800
What?

215
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,910
Look here, Aide Choi. Even
if you're the senior aide,

216
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,870
aren't you being too much between
the same 4th-level aides?

217
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,220
What are you saying I'm
being too much about?

218
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,640
- Why are you doing this? Please stop.

219
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,500
No matter how messed up the hierarchy is in
the Assembly Hall, still this is not right.

220
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
And when you first entered
the Assembly Hall,

221
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,720
I was the vice president
of the Aides Association.

222
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,380
If you are a veteran, you
should act like one!

223
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,210
Aide Choi, it's you who
should act properly.

224
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,300
How did you comport yourself normally
to put your name on the scandal sheet!

225
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,600
- Aide Seo!<b>- I am telling
you in no uncertain terms!</b>

226
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,920
This, text messaging, di di di di
di di, this. I am not doing it.

227
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,820
No, I will not do it!

228
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,350
Why, so unlike you, did you do it?

229
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,530
You used to tell me that
a useless spirit of

230
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,790
resistance is the shortcut
to an early demise.

231
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,120
I did, right?

232
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,820
But I'm a right-winger.
I can't forgive spies.

233
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,940
Secretary Oh.

234
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,820
Is the accounting summary finished?

235
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,080
Is this all?

236
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,500
Yes.

237
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,040
You have to give me
details together with the

238
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,500
receipts so I can report
to the Assemblyman.

239
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,620
In the future, I will report
directly to the Assemblyman.

240
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,880
What did you say?

241
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,020
When I asked other assemblymen's offices,

242
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:30,170
there are more where the administrative
secretary does the reporting.

243
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,710
Do it again.

244
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,370
I can't do that.

245
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,090
Secretary Oh!

246
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,920
Why are you two like that?

247
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,620
What's the matter?

248
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,660
There was a little dispute over who
reports the accounting summaries.

249
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,050
Secretary Oh, you do it from now on.

250
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,730
Assemblyman.

251
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,330
Does an aide have to know even
how an assemblyman uses money?

252
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,990
What are you doing?

253
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,750
I want just one free glass.

254
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,660
Why?

255
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,710
You want to console me in your way?

256
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,070
Isn't that allowed?

257
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,380
Just one glass.

258
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:33,450

doing to the Assemblyman?</i>

269
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,640

273
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,420
<i>... already wronged when you got passed
up for the Gyeongjae nomination.</i>

274
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,780
What are you going to do in the future?

275
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,660
In the future?

276
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,330
Do what?

277
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,850
The Assemblyman's office...

278
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,360
Are you going to keep working for him?

279
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,040
Enough with that chatter. Just study this.

280
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,600
The other side will surely spread rumors
or weak points about the Assemblyman.

281
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,960
Don't get flustered.

282
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,300
And you have to respond according
to what's written here.

283
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,870
I...

284
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,730
can never understand you, Aide-nim.

285
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,020
When we visited you because you were
ill, I saw an incomplete resignation.

286
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,240
Why do you keep hanging in there
when you're having such a hard time?

287
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,040
Even the Assemblyman treats
you now like you're a spy.

288
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,020
Human beings can briefly hesitate.

289
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,920
- But I trust the Assemblyman.<b>- No.</b>

290
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,520
Your judgment was wrong.

291
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,980
Our Assemblyman...

292
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,380
is not such an amazing person as you think.

293
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,500
Let's stop. What use is this talk with you?

294
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,340
I wish you'd be more at ease.

295
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,600
I said let's stop.

296
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,280
<i>I would like to give you
a strategic nomination</i>

297
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,000
<i>to run as our Gookmin Party's candidate.</i>

298
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,130
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

299
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,210
<i>Let's talk later. Wait outside.</i>

<i>- Sunbae-nim!<b>- In Kyung!</i></b>

301
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,900
<i>Wait outside.</i>

302
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,130
What are you thinking about so hard?

303
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,620
Umm...

304
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,360
did you drink?

305
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,790
A little.

306
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,480
Why drink and then come to work?

307
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,830
From now on, events in the constituency...

308
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,640
I will personally manage them.

309
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,180
Meetings not taking place at the
spot like today will not happen.

310
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,880
In the case of the new harbor project,

311
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,920
all sorts of events and power
brokering will continue for now.

312
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,530
But we must refrain from
direct confrontation and wait.

313
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,520
When time passes and the fever subsides,

314
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,650
we will counterattack with
your own development strategy.

315
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,640
My development strategy?

316
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,730
Gyeongjae City's sustainable
development model

317
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,980
that preserves the environment and
the working class's livelihood.

318
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,900
In a few days, I should be able

319
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,410
to at least present a draft to you.

320
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,770
Assemblyman.

321
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,140
As much as you trusted me,

322
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,520
I know your shock is also great.

323
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,270
But you have to trust me.

324
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,790
I am not on such great terms
with Secretary General Baek

325
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,240
as you think.

326
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,270
What do you mean by that?

327
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,460
Because I...

328
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,400
proclaimed war by saying that I would make

329
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,220
you into Gyeongjae City's next assemblyman.

330
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,270
Why did you do that?

331
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,980
This is my fight.

332
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,670
This is...

333
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,800
yours and mine, our fight.

334
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,270
Before being your aide, I...

335
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,520
am your comrade, Assemblyman.

336
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,480
This is unfair. Really.

337
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,850
Ahew, I almost got duped again.

338
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,490
But...

339
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,040
are you asking me to believe those words?

340
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,750
Am I a dummy?

341
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,310
- Assemblyman...<b>- Go
out and ask people.</b>

342
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:06,290
Stop them on their way and see if even
one of them believes those words.

343
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,640
Just look at Gyeongjae City now.

344
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,920
Everyone is screaming for Secretary
General Baek, Secretary General Baek.

345
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,930
And, the closest person
to Secretary General Baek

346
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,680
will be on my side?

347
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,740
Are you really...

348
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,520
going to disappoint me like this?

349
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,790
Who's disappointed in whom?!

350
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:30,390
I'm the one who's disappointed!
Because I was hoodwinked!

351
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,770
Now, I'm really sick and tired of
both of you. So let's stop, okay?

352
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,850
Let's stop.

353
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,060
There should be a limit to
toying with another person.

354
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,080
Why? Why are you looking
at me like that again?

355
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,910
Why? You're going to act again? Huh?

356
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,930
I...

357
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,620
I guess I...

358
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,920
overestimated you a lot.

359
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,310
Your office...

360
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,860
I am going to quit.

361
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,730
Yes!

362
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,030
As it was, I was worried about how I
could sack you with everyone looking on.

363
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,420
But since you're offering
to leave on your own,

364
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,950
that worked out great. I'm
thankful, very much so!

365
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,670
No.

366
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,030
I'm the one who should be thankful

367
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:43,910
because you're showing me
your very worst like this.

368
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,890
Ms. Choi In Kyung.

369
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,220
Don't do any useless thing and be
loyal to Secretary General Baek.

370
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,020
So you can wear the badge next time.

371
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:13,010
Oh, that's a really good idea.

372
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,170
Yes, I will do that.

373
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,090
Without fail, I will do that.

374
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,330
<i>Constituent Response Manual</i>

375
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,570
<i>Welcome Government Due Diligence Team</i>

376
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,630
<i>Gyeongjae Citizens Love Baek Do Hyeon.</i>

377
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,320
Oh, he's coming!

378
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,480
<i>Here he comes.</i>

379
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,960
Yes, thank you.

380
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,030
Baek Do Hyeon! Baek Do Hyeon!

381
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,030
Ah, yes, yes, thank you.

382
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:15,810
Baek Do Hyeon! Baek Do Hyeon!
Baek Do Hyeon!

383
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,200
What you asked me the last time

384
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,180
about shortening the bus
waiting time to 30 minutes...

385
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,020
I've settled at 45 minutes.

386
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,590
That will be across the board...

387
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,870
If you can endure it until then...

388
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,320
I heard that there is a
big event at the City

389
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,810
Hall today. Aren't you
going, Assemblyman Jin?

390
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,070
I had a prior engagement here today.

391
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,260
I will go after this.

392
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,280
But, that Baek Do Hyeon guy seems
to be a somebody, after all.

393
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,200
He coughs a few times
and government workers

394
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,340
are coming out in droves.

395
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,300
Gyeongjae City has
produced a public figure.

396
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,790
I heard that he was born in Sangwon-Ri.

397
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,090
Assemblyman Jin, where in
Gyeongjae City were you born?

398
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,800
My hometown is not here.

399
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,480
Huh? Not here?

400
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,660
Aigoo!

401
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,440
What use is a hometown nowadays?

402
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,720
Where you live is your hometown.

403
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,230
Isn't that so?

404
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,430
Still, it is not like that.

405
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,930
Don't you think the citizen
response nowadays is a bit tepid?

406
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,350
I've heard that those
Come Baek Home weasels

407
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,390
are chewing you out so much,
calling you an outsider.

408
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,830
No need to worry about that. What day
and age do we live in for that to work?

409
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,480
This kid, this kid... How
can you be so naive?!

410
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,820
Just a moment!

411
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,040
Oh my, isn't this the Assemblyman?

412
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,700
That's right! It's him!

413
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,960
Yes, I'm Jin Sang Pil,
Gyeongjae City's servant

414
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,140
who is always sweating and doing his best.

415
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,460
We are Jin Sang Pil. Here...

416
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,700
Umm, let me ask you a question.

417
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,020
When you vote,

418
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,920
do you consider the
candidate's hometown or not?

419
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,670
- Aigo, Hyung, why do you ask so
useless...<b>- Of course we consider it.</b>

420
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,010
If they are about the same, of course
we should take care of our own first.

421
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,390
Why would we let outsiders have a ball?

422
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,430
That's right! Aren't we one big family?

423
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,150
Right!

424
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,500
If you have any civil matter,

425
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,320
I will take care of it if you
give me a call at that number.

426
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,660
Yes.

427
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,200
Call us.

428
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,480
Assemblyman, take care!

429
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,750
Goodbye. Thank you!

430
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,590
- Oh my, that was a national
assemblyman.<b>- Goodbye.</b>

431
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,830
Hey, you saw that, right?

432
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,750
They say they'll take
care of their own first.

433
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,530
But you don't have a competitive
edge against Secretary General Baek.

434
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,410
I'm saying you are screwed, punk.

435
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,240
Of course, yes.

436
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,160
I run into you often in
Gyeongjae City nowadays.

437
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,200
Because I don't like law that much,

438
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,420
I try not to do as it says normally, but
doing this in another's constituency...

439
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,060
isn't this a violation of the election
law prohibiting premature campaigning?

440
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,160
Do I look like I'm campaigning right now?

441
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,840
A person who has nothing
to do with Gyeongjae City

442
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,630
is making a big scene with a
government due diligence team.

443
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,820
If that's not campaigning, what is it?

444
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,670
I guess your aides are not
working properly these days.

445
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,100
A few days ago, I was appointed
the chairman of Gookmin

446
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,670
Party's Special Committee for
National Land Development.

447
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,130
So, today, I am here not
as the Secretary General,

448
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,390
but as the chairman of
the special committee.

449
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,630
How can a so-called assemblyman

450
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,850
not even know that, unless he's really
indifferent to his constituency?

451
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,660
Wow...

452
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,820
When we had Aide Choi, nothing
like this happened. Hey!

453
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,960
If they act like that, what do we do now?

454
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,980
<i>All sorts of events and power
brokering will continue for now.</i>

455
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,780
<i>But we must refrain from
direct confrontation and wait.</i>

456
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,120
So, once the result of the
field investigation comes out,

457
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,900
we are planning to start negotiation
with the proper authorities.

458
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,460
<i>But we must refrain from
direct confrontation and wait.</i>

459
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:46,570
But, Secretary General Baek,
what is your opinion?

460
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:53,230
I am a bit hesitant in saying this,
but we, the Gookmin Party, too,

461
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,330
are thinking among ourselves
that this is very feasible.

462
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,130
Team Leader.

463
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,420
Team Leader!

464
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,120
I have a question.

465
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,680
Yes, Assemblyman.

466
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,240
Team Leader, we have met a few
times in Sejong City (Korea's

467
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,580
second administrative capital
city after Seoul), right?

468
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,040
Yes.

469
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,270
At those times, you told me the
project had no feasibility.

470
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,050
What?

471
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,610
Why is he doing that?

472
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,870
<i>Ah. Really.</i>

473
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,990
Because there are many big harbors
nearby and the inlet is narrow,

474
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,420
you told me it was hard
to build a new harbor.

475
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,200
Was that a lie, then?

476
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,480
Since such opinions exist too

477
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,960
we have to carefully evaluate it, I
think that's what I meant to tell you.

478
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,520
Government workers are said to be soulless.

479
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,140
But, Team Leader, your
soul is highly developed.

480
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,550
It changes drastically
depending on the situation.

481
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:56,770
I demand as the National Assemblyman
of Gyeongjae City District,

482
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,230
that the government stop
being swayed by politics.

483
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,780
And the ruling party stop filling
the citizenry with hot air.

484
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,780
Hot air, it's a bit awkward to hear that.

485
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,700
What are you saying? It's a bad check.

486
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,480
Assemblyman Jin! What do you
think you're doing right now?

487
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,630
Are you saying Gyeongjae City's assemblyman
will go against the citizens' wish?

488
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,190
Look here!

489
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,090
Are you the only people
living in Gyeongjae City?

490
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,830
Huh? Are you people here the
only citizens of Gyeongjae City?

491
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,590
I've walked around in my sneakers.

492
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,660
There are tons of people worried at
the mere mention of a new harbor,

493
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,690
because the real estate prices will
sky-rocket and rents will go up too.

494
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:40,270
They've lived by fishing and
running small stores for tourists.

495
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,460
There are a lot of people
who have lived like

496
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,690
that and are worried about
future livelihoods.

497
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,600
I have also met a countless
number of people worried

498
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,710
about possibly harming our
city's beautiful environment.

499
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,910
Even though they have no
power or organizations,

500
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,750
aren't they, aren't those people
also residents of Gyeongjae City?

501
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:06,950
Those people are Gyeongjae citizens
just like you! Don't exclude them!

502
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,090
Hey, from just listening to this
person, isn't he totally a spy?

503
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,570
Right now, are you trying to
spoil an all-finished dish?

504
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,530
Is this an all-finished dish? Huh?

505
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,600
I'm asking you whether this is a done deal!

506
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,440
Since they're coming and going
with a due diligence team,

507
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,120
it looks as though it's done, right?
No way in hell!

508
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,320
Saying yes, yes, they will fill you up with
hot air and once the election is over,

509
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,240
it will be all back to square one!

510
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,460
Wake up and smell the coffee, please!

511
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,780
Get out! How can there be such a jerk?!

512
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,890
Don't talk down to me! Why
are you talking down to me?

513
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,590
I said don't talk down to me!

514
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,310
- What if I do?<b>- What?</b>

515
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,010
Okay, so?

516
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,140
Let's say a new harbor is built. How
many ships do you think we'll see?

517
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,780
Do you think ships will
just overflow it, huh?

518
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,480
Didn't you see the next door
neighbor with a new airport?

519
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:55,460
If only a new airport is built, do
airplanes flock to it, flock in?

520
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,600
There are tons of airports all over the
country that can't even make ends meet.

521
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,300
The new harbor will end up like
that, too, okay? It will go down!

522
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,880
Are you going to play an
origami ship game, now?

523
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,300
Huh?! You cannot do this.

524
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,440
- You cannot work willy nilly
like this!<b>- Get the hell out!</b>

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,420
No, you must not!

526
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,010
Huh?!

527
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,900
We declare that...

528
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,880
we cannot acknowledge Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil, who has ignored

529
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,430
the Gyeongjae citizens' long cherished
wish, as Gyeongjae City's assemblyman.

530
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,410
Moreover, we solemnly
swear that we will start

531
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,050
a community-wide movement to
oust<b> Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil!</b>

532
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:43,220
With regard to Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil's <b>inappropriate behavior,</b>

533
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,620
our party cannot suppress its deep
concern <b>and sense of disappointment.</b>

534
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,630
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil,

535
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,400
before the Party, and citizens
of Korea and Gyeongjae City,

536
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,150
kneel down and beg for forgiveness.

537
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,490
- Office of Jin Sang Pil...<b><i>-
I am a Gyeongjae citizen.</i></b>

538
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,770
<i>-Put Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil

something important to say...

540
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,930
Well, the Assemblyman is really not here.

541
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,340
Stop just being angry and...

542
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,330
I understand what you are saying, but...

543
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,660
Sir, umm...

544
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,780
- Aish, why are you cursing at me?
Do you know me?<b>- We'll contact you.</b>

545
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,170
Do you know me so you are cursing...

546
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,580
But what are you doing, so
rudely, to a voter right now?

547
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,260
Yes, please tell me. I
will lend a listening ear.

548
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,040
I am an aide.

549
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,880
Yes, I understand what you are saying...

550
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,090
Don't curse!

551
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:48,620
Hey, punk, how old are you? What?

552
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,340
You called a wrong number, punk!

553
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,290
Everyone, hang up.

00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:31,210
- Jin Sang Pil, get out!<b>- Get out!
Get out!</b>

562
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,360
The fan club and Support Committee will
start collecting signatures on a petition

563
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,390
to oust Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil starting
tomorrow in Yeouido and Gyeongjae City.

564
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,080
The local media in Gyeongjae
City are pumpingout

565
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,860
critical pieces aimed at
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

566
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,410
I will try to make the central
media join the bandwagon as well.

567
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,300
It cannot end as a one-time whirlwind.

568
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,820
Assemblyman Jin will try to hang in and
wait for the popular opinion to subside.

569
00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:00,060
There has to be a knock-out punch
to make him throw in the towel.

570
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,030
I have searched through the
Party's ethical code but could

571
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,900
not find a serviceable reason
for disciplinary actions.

572
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,960
There is a more effective method
than disciplinary actions.

573
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,760
What is that?

574
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:14,420
Baek Do Hyeon is using the
influential people of Gyeongjae City

575
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,210
to corner Jin Sang Pil as in a rabbit hunt.

576
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,520
He must want to finish him up quickly.

577
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,800
Because the popular opinion
may change at any time.

578
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,510
Assemblyman Park.

579
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:33,000
Jin Sang Pil is right now like a
godforsaken sailboat in a boundless sea.

580
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,960
Should we help him out a little?

581
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,310
Let him be.

582
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:43,210
What use is resuscitating
an almost dead person.

583
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,920
I guess,

584
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,300
we are not the 911 emergency rescuers.

585
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,450
Secretary General Baek, what
do I owe this honor to?

586
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:57,740
Leaving an old nest and
trying to build a new one...

587
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,940
How is it going? Not easy, right?

588
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,310
So it is.

589
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,490
At any rate,

590
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:09,890
this time, I marveled at
your strategy once again.

591
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,910
While tightly holding on to the
local leaders with a new harbor,

592
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:20,080
and making the natives turn their backs on
Jin Sang Pil for being an out-of-towner...

593
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,450
For distressed Assemblyman Jin

594
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,280
there is no other way than
to make a suicide goal.

595
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,410
Getting complimented by a guru
like you, Assemblyman Park...

596
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,380
This is a great honor.

597
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,260
But I don't care for clever moves too much.

598
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,550
There is a baduk saying that three
clever moves will cost the game.

599
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:41,810
So this time, I think I will engage the
standard tactics instead of a sneaky move.

600
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,670
Is there something you want from me?

601
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,210
More than 70% of the party
members in Gyeongjae City

602
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,930
belong to the Anti-BH faction.

603
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,150
Please use your influence on them.

604
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,790
If I do that,

605
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,850
how will you pay my wages?

606
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:07,200
I will enable you to focus
only on the election campaign

607
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,220
without having to worry
about the party nomination.

So, that is, oh, it's right here.

610
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:30,950
If the members demand convening a
general meeting, then it can be done.

611
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:32,570
Right.

612
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,720

618
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,440
We must come up with a plan, too,

619
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,630

here for over 20 years,

621
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,990
you must have gone through a lot
of similar situations, right?

622
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,790
Ah, that is, as for myself,

623
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,520
I've worked mainly specializing
in the policy area and...

624
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,430
Aigoo, seriously, I'm about
to blow my gut and flip!

625
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,850
Then, are you saying we should
just sit still like this

626
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,570
and silently watch Secretary
General Baek gobbling up

627
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,970

00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,750
Enough already.

680
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:35,240
beating. How are you
going to knock him down?

681
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,440
There are two ways to win in a fight.

682
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,290
Either knock him out or
get him to surrender.

683
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,190
Surrender?

684
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:52,820
I have selected only the ones with the
right kinds of resumes and experience.

685
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:59,390
Do you think you might like any of them?

686
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:06,380
<i>Resume</i> Before being your aide,

687
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,400
I am a like-minded person with you.

688
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,560
There isn't.

689
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,650
<i>Assemblywoman Hong Chan
Mi wants to see you.</i>

690
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,290
Haven't you hired a successor to Choi,
the lolling star of gossip rags, yet?

691
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:42,560
Why? Do you want to recommend to
me an amazeballs person again?

692
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,980
You are so greedy.

693
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,920
How can I find a person of better
ability than Secretary Sim Dong Cheon?

694
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,710
I can easily imagine. What is your agenda?

695
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:59,670
- I came here to deliver Secretary
General Baek's proposal.<b>- What is it?</b>

696
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:04,040
Announce your intention not to run
in next year's general election.

697
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,620
-Hello.<b>- Whether you call out
<i>"Hello"</i> or not, Assemblyman Jin!</b>

698
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,530
You have no one to turn to for help.
You'd better

699
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,410
take the practical benefit
instead of your pride.

700
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,520
The practical benefit?

701
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,150
As soon as you announce it,
you will get back into the

702
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,620
Pro-BH faction, under the
banner of Secretary Baek.

703
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,420
That means, even if you are not
serving in the Assembly next year,

704
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,250
you may get a director's-level
position at a large public company.

705
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:38,110
Go and tell him not to say nonsense.

706
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,280
I can imagine you are
searching around for a

707
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,720
job at the iron foundry
with your resume.

708
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,570
Secretary General will
wait for you one more day.

709
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,810
Consider it carefully.

710
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,460
What's the reason you perversely engineered
this occasion through Sunbae Jo?

711
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,150
We have met over official
matters in the meantime. Isn't

712
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,740
it good we can chat about old
times after a long time?

713
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:27,310
I am uncomfortable because your changed
features overrides your former image.

714
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,420
I didn't change but just
got in step with reality.

715
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,280
You succumbed to the reality.

716
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,450
Now, why don't you transfer to
the Secretary General's office?

717
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:44,560
Is it really necessary for
you to give a favor to me?

718
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:50,500
In Kyung, you are my comrade
of 20 years and the best aide.

719
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,740
I want to prove I am right.

720
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,030
I hope you watch over me.

721
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,030
Let's go for karaoke.

722
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,490
Scumbag punk!

723
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,250
Have you seen Assemblywoman Hong?

724
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,100
What about? Announcing not to run
in next year's general election?

725
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:38,690
Ah. You have not heard it yet. I asked
her to tell you not to say nonsense.

726
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,110
You have to have the
courage to admit defeat.

727
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,120
I am not defeated yet.

728
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:50,510
I can't be defeated by a
corrupt person like you.

729
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,560
Is that so?

730
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:59,820
As you said, let's consider
I killed Hyung Dal Soo.

731
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:06,650
But, if I lose to you, I will
kill Dal Soo Hyung a second time.

732
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,990
That's why I must not lose to you.

733
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:11,640
Understand?

734
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:30,490
Excuse me, Aide Choi. I am sorry.

735
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,260
Have you been well, Choi In Kyung?

736
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,120
Yes.

737
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,550
It is good that you have been well.

738
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,280
In Kyung.

739
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,830
Yes.

740
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,300
Go ahead.

741
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,990
Assemblyman.

742
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,270
Declare your intention not to run
in next year's general election.

743
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:33,290
Hey, Assemblyman Jin, since we
can't get caught like this,

744
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:38,820
let's see Aide Choi once with the view of a
drowning man aiming to grasp at a straw.

745
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,540
We can make a good excuse to see her.

746
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,650
Just make an excuse of asking about
the maintenance fee for this house.

747
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:51,210
It seems we made a mistake to Aide
Choi, no matter how we think.

748
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:56,700
We didn't make a mistake. Just let it be.

749
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,440
Who is Aide Choi?

750
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,450
Joo Hee!

751
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,740
Hey, Dunce! How did you get here?

752
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,540
How? I searched the
address in the computer.

753
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,250
Ta da! Pickled mustard kimchi!

754
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,540
Aigoo. How come Assemblyman
drinks every day?

755
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:25,790
Hey. This is the first time I'm
drinking since I drank at that time.

756
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,010
I came home.

757
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,980
Ahwoo! A big dunce came, too.

758
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,330
Hey, why do you come home so late, punk?

759
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,330
I met friends.

760
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:37,030
Hello.

761
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,710
Hi!

762
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,090
It's the right time.

763
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:49,940
Secretary Kim, we have to discuss
a kind of serious matter.

764
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,620
Would you take Joo Hee and play with her?

765
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,810
Yes. Of course.

766
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,480
Do you want to go to an Internet café?

767
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,620
Cool! Oppa, you don't work but play games.

768
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,470
If you work at an Internet café for a few
years, you are able to do this much.

769
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,710
Did you attend school while working?

770
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:10,800
Yes. Why?

771
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,690
Nothing. But you look like
a son from a rich home.

772
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:19,630
By the way, you're speaking informally
from a while ago, young kiddo.

773
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,250
Aihee! We have the same
situation of getting older.

774
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,380
There is no way.

775
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,610
Even I will go and meet her.

776
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:39,330
Why would you do that? Why?

777
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,310
Why even you?

778
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:44,600
We have to do something!

779
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:50,030
Are you going to finish your term stupidly
while your soul shrivels like this?

780
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:55,230
Seriously. Leave Aide Choi
alone no matter what.

781
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,250
She is pitiful if you know.

782
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,330
What about?

783
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:05,180
Why is she pitiful? Because
she got fired by you?

784
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,150
Hey. To my eyes,

785
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:11,840
you are more pitiful and stifling, punk!

786
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,350
You don't know! If I were not there,

787
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,120
Aide Choi...

788
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,070
If it were not for me...

789
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:27,540
Aide Choi...she should have worn the
Assembly badge for Gyeongjae City.

790
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,690
What? Assemblywoman?

791
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:33,750
Oh my! What are you saying?

792
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,890
The nomination that was
supposed to go to Aide Choi,

793
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:42,840
it came to me with a detour!

794
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:48,350
How can I make her my Aide? How?

795
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:56,790
Can I make her Assemblywoman?

796
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:02,650
Just, she should stay with
Secretary General Baek, now.

797
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:08,890
Let's leave her alone, huh?

798
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:13,930
Just leave her alone with Secretary Baek...

799
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,450
Did it happen that way?

800
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:32,210
<i>Somehow, I feel like...</i>

801
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:36,130
<i>even if I try something and fail
at it, with that assemblyman,</i>

802
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:38,890
<i>I won't get hurt.</i>

803
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,220
Kim Gyu Hwan?

804
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,890
You drank a lot?

805
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:17,640
Today, I have to admit it.

806
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,590
What are you talking? What do you admit?

807
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:24,950
Our Assemblyman, Jin Sang Pil.

808
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,710
Kim Gyu Hwan!

809
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:36,360
Only today, I will admit what you said.

810
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,780
Our Assemblyman.

811
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,920
What on earth happened to you?

812
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,420
Ah. I got in big trouble.

813
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,780
Aigoo.

814
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:20,920
I am in big trouble. I have to
go to the constituency today.

815
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,500
Ah, my stomach!

816
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,580
Hyung Seong Gi!

817
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:36,760
No... I can see an apparition. Wake up!

818
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,540
Hello.

819
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,960
Oh.

820
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:05,200
What brings you here, so early?

821
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:14,330
I come here to apply for the position
of Aide in your Assembly office.
