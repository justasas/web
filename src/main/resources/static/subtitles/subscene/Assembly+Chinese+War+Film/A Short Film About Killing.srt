00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,509
A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING

3
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,710
Screenplay

4
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:55,789
Directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski

5
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,349
Throwing away Floor cloths?

6
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,229
They can be useful.

7
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,310
Someone flung it at me.

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,909
It hit you?

9
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,789
No.

10
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,189
Haven't you seen anyone
carrying this?

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,699
I don't like cats.

12
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,990
They're as unreliable as men.

13
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,590
Is it a good film?

14
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,229
No, it's boring.

15
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,189
What's it about?

16
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,270
It's about love,
but it's boring.

17
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,710
Besides, it's only showing
in the afternoon.

18
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,469
What are you doing?

19
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,030
Removing my white hair.

20
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,150
Where can I find a taxi?

21
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,509
Royal Castle Square.

22
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,189
Hello.

23
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,259
Hello.

24
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,949
Mr Balicki?

25
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,029
Come in, please.

26
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,069
Would you like a portrait?

27
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,269
How much do you charge?

28
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,149
Two thousand.

29
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,189
Is it long to make one?

30
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,670
What do you mean?

31
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,829
It's not my time you pay for.

32
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,540
You pay

33
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,899
For my talent.

34
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,829
Do you have a talent?

35
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,029
No.

36
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,910
Can you make shoes?

37
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,149
Raise a tree?

38
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,350
A tree?

39
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,949
Yes, I can.

40
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,189
No need to worry then.

41
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,389
Royal Castle Square?

42
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,949
Straight ahead.

43
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,829
I'm trying to think about
how I should answer that.

44
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,639
I've been asked
that question twice.

45
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,029
When I was at college,
the answer was easy.

46
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,949
Then four years ago, right here,

47
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,310
I wasn't so sure anymore.

48
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,509
And now...

49
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,430
it's a good question.

50
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,500
Why do I want to become a lawyer?

51
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,790
Shall I give an honest answer

52
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,189
or shall I say
what I'm supposed to?

53
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,509
We want to know you.

54
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,670
To put it briefly, I don't know.

55
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,550
I'm attracted to...

56
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,709
In the past 4 years, I've seen...

57
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,750
It's a job

58
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,319
which we could say
has a social function.

59
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,079
It's important
that it should be useful.

60
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,750
But what I think
I like the most about this job

61
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,990
is that...
If I succeed in this exam,

62
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,430
I'll be able to meet
and to understand people

63
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,189
I'd never meet
if I'd chosen a different job.

64
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,269
That's my motivation.

65
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,790
I think that as we grow older,
the answer becomes

66
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,350
all the more elusive.

67
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,579
Every man wonders
about the meaning of his job.

68
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,990
I think the further we go,

69
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,269
the more we doubt.

70
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,669
The goods, Chief.

71
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,070
Hurry up, Beata.

72
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,590
Hello.

73
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,590
Go away,
you're scaring the pigeons!

74
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,029
Will you go away?

75
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,539
Are you free?

76
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,230
I'm washing it, see?

77
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,470
We'll wait, it's cold.

78
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,190
In your words, can you explain
the principle

79
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,309
of overall prevention?

80
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,309
Basically,

81
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,669
it concerns not so much a convict
as the other people

82
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,029
so that they don't end up
like that convict.

83
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,710
- Shall I be more specific?
- Yes.

84
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,620
It's about how
the acts of a Convict,

85
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,350
or rather of convicts,
affect other people.

86
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,870
It simply involves instilling fear
into people.

87
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,070
That's what we read
in the Penal Code.

88
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,990
I don't appreciate
your ironic tone.

89
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,149
It's a questionable argument
used to justify

90
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,190
a cruel punishment,

91
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,070
often unfair.

92
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:46,350
Could you support your thesis

93
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,190
with a classical quotation?

94
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,070
"Since Cain, no punishment

95
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,830
"has been capable

96
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,750
"of improving the world."

97
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,110
- Shall I name the author?
- It won't be needed.

98
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,269
Chief made a mistake
with your account.

99
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,389
Do you fancy a ride, Miss?

100
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,549
My wife made it.
You want it?

101
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,950
Eat up!

102
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,829
Hello.

103
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,470
I have...

104
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,950
You're the plumber?

105
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:01,940
No.

106
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,509
I thought you were.

107
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,750
I have a photo.

108
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,990
Could you

109
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,470
blow it up?

110
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,829
The crease mark will stay.

111
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:29,180
That's okay.

112
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,299
All right.

113
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,349
Excuse me.

114
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,789
Can we really tell
From someone's photo

115
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,180
if they're dead or not?

116
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,390
Someone tried to fool you.

117
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,630
- How's things?
- Couldn't be better.

118
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,829
The last number?

119
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,700
Seventeen.

120
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:14,019
I have that one.

121
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,390
Sixteen.

122
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:19,299
Sixteen? That close?

123
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:22,150
fifteen then.

124
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,779
You always fill them out carefully.

125
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,630
Personally, I like order.

126
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,750
Your luck is in.

127
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,109
How much did you get last month?

128
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,859
412.

129
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,390
And 1 200 in the autumn.

130
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:43,910
Last week, you got 46.

131
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,119
- Adding all that up...
- I'm getting by.

132
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,309
But I wish I could...

133
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,140
Well...

134
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,430
You wish...

135
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,230
Ours is the best club!

136
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,710
We support the best club!

137
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,789
Mr Balicki.

138
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,670
I am very pleased to tell you
you've passed.

139
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,710
After your four-year apprenticeship,

140
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,150
you will be a fellow lawyer.

141
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,910
Congratulations.

142
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,430
All you have to do
is take oath.

143
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,390
I passed my exam!

144
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,829
I'm a lawyer!

145
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,589
I'm a lawyer!

146
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,630
Stop fooling around.

147
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,349
Get on!

148
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,670
German?

149
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,500
from Bulgaria?

150
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,700
I can tell your fortune.

151
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,220
Spare me some change,
For my child.

152
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,390
You'll leave the country.

153
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,990
No!

154
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,750
I'm not afraid of anything.

155
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,029
Let me read your hands.

156
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,549
I'll tell the truth.

157
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,670
All right, do it.

158
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,390
- A tea.
- We've none left.

159
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,710
- What do you have?
- Coffee, pastries.

160
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,069
A coffee and a pastry, then.

161
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,430
- Which one?
- A choux pastry.

162
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,430
Not that one, that other one.

163
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,630
Your line of fortune
is long and strong.

164
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,869
Two children.

165
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,700
When?

166
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,829
There are moments in life

167
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,950
when anything seems possible.

168
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,109
Your route is clearly
laid down before you.

169
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,549
That's how I felt
when I finished school.

170
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,750
That's how I feel today.

171
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,579
When you cross a certain threshold,
there's a moment

172
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:27,420
when you feel
it all depends on you.

173
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,109
Exactly.

174
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:33,230
You know what I think?

175
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,910
No, I never do.

176
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,630
People will love you.

177
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,869
Just like I love you now.

178
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,670
Are you by any chance going

179
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,099
to Mokotow?

180
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,789
No, to Wola.

181
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,380
We're in a hurry.

182
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,430
To Mokotow.

183
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,950
Where were they going?

184
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,470
To Wola.

185
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,750
Calm down.
He's a bit nervous.

186
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,750
What is it?

187
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,109
Nothing.

188
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,990
It may not be that easy.

189
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,510
Wind up the window, please.

190
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,860
It's cold.

191
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,030
Turn left here.

192
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,190
I could go straight ahead.

193
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,110
I prefer this way.

194
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,619
As you wish.

195
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,030
Stop, it's over there.

196
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,909
- You can't drive on.
- I wasn't going any further.

197
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,110
Jesus!

198
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,670
Please, I beg you...

199
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,139
I beg you.

200
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,829
I'll tell you
about a brave little lion

201
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,550
Whose courage grew bigger every day

202
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,230
All the other lions

203
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,949
Said to his face

204
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:20,590
That a lion must always have
the heart of a lion

205
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,909
I understand very well
and I like to be brave,

206
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,579
But sometimes I get so scared,,.

207
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,429
Is it still open?

208
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,550
Jacek? Come in!

209
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,219
Hi, Beata!
Are you going to bed?

210
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,949
Yes, very soon.

211
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,670
Come out a second,
I have something to show you.

212
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,829
Do I have to change?

213
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,710
No, you don't have to.

214
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,230
- Is it far?
- It's right here.

215
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,070
I told you. Get in.

216
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:27,989
You wanted to go somewhere.

217
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:30,829
Now we can.

218
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,269
You said you had a customer

219
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,349
who went to the mountains.

220
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,190
Her husband...

221
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,989
We can go to the mountains.

222
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,909
We'll put down the seats.

223
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,750
I have some blankets.

224
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,989
The weather will warm up.

225
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,150
Where did you get that car?

226
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,440
This session is closed.

227
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:31,679
Is this the end, Mr Balicki?

228
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,869
Is this the end, Mr Balicki?

229
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,380
The end.

230
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,030
It's me.

231
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,789
I lost it.

232
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,269
Through and through.

233
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,510
I don't know.

234
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,309
Perhaps I'll go for walk.

235
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:05,260
No, don't come.

236
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:08,909
How are you?

237
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,150
Have you slept?

238
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,389
Good.

239
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,269
Yes. Bye.

240
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,909
Excuse me.

241
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:55,070
Jacek!

242
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:05,230
Excuse me.

243
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,829
I know this is not usual practice...

244
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:12,869
Indeed... it's not usual practice.

245
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,469
I wanted to ask you,
now that it's over.

246
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,190
Would things have been different

247
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,789
if he'd been defended
by a famous lawyer

248
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,789
instead of me?

249
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,389
Absolutely not.

250
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,909
My summation didn't...

251
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:38,909
Perhaps if I had...

252
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,750
Your summation

253
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:44,989
was a wonderful indictment

254
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,230
of the death penalty.

255
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,710
The sentence
couldn't have been different.

256
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,429
You didn't make any mistakes,
not as a lawyer

257
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,940
Of as a Man.

258
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,670
Despite the awful
present circumstances,

259
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,150
it was a pleasure to meet you.

260
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,110
In this case,

261
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,590
I could have imagined
a better judge.

262
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:21,070
That sentence...

263
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:23,789
it's my responsibility.

264
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,230
- Does that console you?
- No.

265
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,909
You know, when that lad explained

266
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,550
how he'd rolled the rope

267
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,949
around his hand in that bar,

268
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:42,469
- I was there.
- Where?

269
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,909
In that bar,
at the same time.

270
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,909
I had just taken my law exam.

271
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:52,469
Also...

272
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,750
I could have done something.

273
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,469
You're too sensitive to do this jab.

274
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,550
Too late to change that.

275
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,150
Yes, you've become
a bit older today.

276
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,539
Goodbye.

277
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,190
The governor will see you.

278
00:55:56,639 --> 00:55:58,710
- How are you?
- It's hot.

279
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,269
Hello.

280
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,389
The curtain's stuck.

281
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,590
Clean the floor a bit.

282
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,190
Come in.

283
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,429
Everything's ready, sir.

284
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,389
Call number 24.

285
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,389
He's coming.

286
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:43,869
Thank you.

287
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,349
I knew it.

288
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,829
So did I.

289
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,429
Yes, I know.

290
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:54,789
You'll have half an hour.

291
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,590
Half an hour.

292
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,630
Okay.

293
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,550
Take the lawyer there.

294
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,349
Can I leave my briefcase here?

295
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,429
Hello, Mr Balicki.

296
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,110
I'm going to see him.
He wants to talk to me.

297
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,869
Quite a hard duty.

298
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:46,829
Hard indeed.
It's my first time.

299
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,980
I hope it'll be your last one.

300
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:51,469
Mr Balicki.

301
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,349
It may not be the best time
for this,

302
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,550
but I hear you've had a son.
Congratulations.

303
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,550
Yes.

304
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,349
Not very long ago.
Thank you.

305
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:07,309
Did you want to see me?

306
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,829
Yes.

307
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,590
Have you seen my mother?

308
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:17,949
I have.

309
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:21,260
Was she crying?

310
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,469
Yes, she was.

311
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:29,389
Did she ask... far anything?

312
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:34,070
Did she say anything?

313
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,190
No.

314
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,230
All she did was cry.

315
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,980
Sit down.

316
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,429
Could you...

317
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:56,269
Could you...

318
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,989
see my mother once again?

319
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:03,309
When it's all over?

320
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,980
Of course I can.

321
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:10,550
I thought I'd ask you because...

322
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:16,070
at the court you called me...

323
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:19,789
You called me : "Jacek".

324
01:03:23,239 --> 01:03:24,789
I called you...

325
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,670
I wanted to...

326
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:33,309
I don't know what I wanted.

327
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,739
I'm almost twenty-one,

328
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,190
but when you called me,

329
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,989
I nearly cried.

330
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:03,429
I'd spoken,

331
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,909
in court...

332
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:07,760
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

333
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,989
It was when you called me.

334
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,550
They were all

335
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,190
againSt me,
just like everybody here.

336
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,630
They're against what you did.

337
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,389
That's the same thing.

338
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,469
So you want me
to see your mother.

339
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,269
Yes, to tell her

340
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,309
to bury me next to my father.

341
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,829
Can I be buried in a cemetery?

342
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,429
Yes.

343
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:56,429
The priest they sent said I could.

344
01:04:56,639 --> 01:04:57,829
Naturally.

345
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,539
Okay, next to My father

346
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:07,110
there's still

347
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:12,469
a burial plot,
it was supposed to be my mother's.

348
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:17,829
Ask her to give it to me.

349
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,829
Yes?

350
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:57,030
Yes, sir.

351
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:11,349
The governor asks
if you're through.

352
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:14,699
Not yet.

353
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,019
You were saying?

354
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:31,789
I can't remember.

355
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,670
You were saying
there are three burial plots.

356
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:38,949
Yes, three.

357
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:43,789
My father rests there, then Marysia,

358
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,460
and there's a third one.

359
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:52,150
Marysia was buried there
Five years ago.

360
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,550
She was run over by a tractor.

361
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,710
At home, in the country.

362
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,460
She was about
to finish primary school.

363
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,590
She was twelve years old.

364
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:13,190
finishing primary school.

365
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,059
I was with a friend of mine
who was a tractor driver.

366
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:21,710
He was a friend.

367
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,309
We'd been drinking.

368
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:27,469
Wine and vodka.

369
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:32,829
Then he went and ran her over.

370
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,670
On a field, in undergrowth.

371
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:50,590
Sometimes I wonder...

372
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,380
if she hadn't died,
perhaps...

373
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:58,590
I wouldn't have left.

374
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:02,670
She was my sister.

375
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,070
I had three brothers and a sister.

376
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:08,829
Only one sister.

377
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,429
She was...

378
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,270
She was my favourite one.

379
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,430
She liked me a lot too.

380
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,350
Everything could have been
different.

381
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,470
But then, I had to go.

382
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,619
I had to leave the village.

383
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,550
I didn't want to leave.

384
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:43,869
If I'd stayed, perhaps...

385
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,939
You wouldn't be here now.

386
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,850
Things could have

387
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,539
turned out different.

388
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:06,619
The governor and the deputy
want to know if you're finished.

389
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,939
Tell them I'll never say
I'm finished.

390
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,020
You'll never say that!

391
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:17,350
Never.

392
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,260
We bought the land

393
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:29,229
because Marysia liked trees.

394
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,109
She liked trees and green.

395
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:37,909
That evening,
she was going to walk in the forest.

396
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,149
Do you have the sentence?

397
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,619
It's all there.

398
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,939
Let's go.

399
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,020
You can leave your briefcase here.

400
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,069
Bring out the convict.

401
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:02,819
The deputy tells you to finish it.

402
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,819
In my stuff,

403
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:16,550
there's a receipt
From a photo store.

404
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,300
I had a photo blown up,

405
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,029
but I had no time to pick it up.

406
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:26,350
Could you take the blow-up
to my mother?

407
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,109
What's in it?

408
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,439
It's her first Communion.

409
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:36,420
I took it with me.

410
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:39,109
I creased it.

411
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,829
Let's go.

412
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:55,340
Mr Balicki.

413
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,869
I don't want to go.

414
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:17,470
Last and first names.

415
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,060
Lazar Jacek.

416
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:21,619
Date of birth?

417
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,619
March 17th, 1967.

418
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,310
Parents' first names?

419
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,819
Jan and...

420
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,149
Lucia.

421
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:35,939
I'll read the sentence.

422
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,670
"In the name of
the People's Republic of Poland,

423

"Therefore,

436
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,869
Cigarette?

437
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:47,949
No filter, please.

438
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,300
His hands!

439
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,310
Execute the sentence.

440
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:57,069
Pull it! Keep going.

441
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:58,409
Enough.
