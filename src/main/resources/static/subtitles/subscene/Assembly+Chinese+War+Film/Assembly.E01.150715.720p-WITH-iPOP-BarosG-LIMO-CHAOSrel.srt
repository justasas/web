3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,490
Just looking at this
guy, I get excited...

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,010
While living, I got to wear
most kinds of badges, but

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,710
it seems there is no badge
like this in the world.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,410
But I heard this
isn't real gold.

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,050
It is silver copper, 1.6 cm in diameter,
weighing 6 grams, which is gold plated.

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,110
It's not a badge. It's a symbol of
being the people's representative.

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,630
Anyway, so that I
can just wear this,

10
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,710
please help me out.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,810
You have a prior record which
you didn't tell me about.

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,830
Convictions... 4 of them.

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,607
When a business man has
an unfortunate time while

14
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,230
working hard, he can get
a star (CONVICTION).

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,150
An election is not a battle of stars.<br> (
<I> A "STAR" IS ONE CRIMINAL CONVICTION</I>)

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,750
In asking that now, do you mean you
are quiting being the consultant?

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,430
I'm saying your image
has to be laundered.

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,590
Laundered?

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,090
Are you in the midst of litigation
with the laid-off employees?

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,730
You lost last year in the appellate court.
You must accept all the employees back.

21

<i>Workers Struggle Against

23
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,590
Will I be doing something which
costs the company money?

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,810
I didn't even appear in court because I
don't want to see those guys' faces.

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,210
After coming here,
I've heard it all.

26
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,930

Wow! How long has it
taken to come here?

29
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,810
What do you mean how long?
It didn't take so long.

30
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,210
Hey, Sang Pil. Was
it about five hours?

31
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,030
One thousand, one hundred
and eighty seven days!

32
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,780
From getting laid-off and
submitting a suit to

33
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,730
today, it has been 3 years,
3 months and two days.

39
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,750
I have a weak heart, originally.

40
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,810
Please let me concentrate.
Please.

41
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,610
You Punk, Sang Pil...
Order. Reversal of

42
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,610
the original judgment.

43
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,870
Congratulations!

44
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,450
<i> It doesn't make sense.
It's not fair.</i>

45
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,010
<i>What did he say?</i>

46
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,070
What did he say? Rever...what?

47
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,610
Be quiet!

48
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,990
- Continuing, the reason for the
decision... <br> - I have a question.

49
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,490
Please speak.

50
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,350
I am Organization
Chief Jin Sang Pil.

51
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,310
Something happened. Something.

52
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,030
As a thirsty deer
searches for water...

53
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,281
there was a boy holding
a welding rod instead

54
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:55,790
of a text book because
of his poverty.

55
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,930
From that time, for 23 years,

56
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,870
he has done only welding
very diligently.

57
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,570
But, one day, the
company laid him off.

58
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,750
He said he didn't want to get laid off.
Then he got fired.

59
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,050
When he asked for help from the
union, he got stabbed in the back.

60
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,785
He felt wronged so he protested.
Then, he was jailed

61
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:20,130
and got fined for
interference with business.

62
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,750
I have to pay compensation for damages,
100 million won ($100 THOUSAND).

63
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,550
So?

64
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,450
But, there is a hole to escape
even if the sky collapses.

65
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,930
The judges who sided with the
company at the first trial...

66
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,730
listened to us at
the second trial.

67
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,550
I...

68
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,310
like a mouse waiting for the
sun to shine into his hole...

69
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,070
have been looking
forward to today.

70
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,930
<i>Only ask questions!</i>

71
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,310
Yes. I will only ask a question.

72
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,530
Why don't you say <i>"Sorry"</i> to us?

73
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,810
What?

74
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,910
Why don't you say <i>"Sorry"</i> to us?

75
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,090
You pretended to be soothing a crying
baby, then slapped it on the cheek.

76
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,290
- You slapped the cheek again
that just got slapped. <br>-Sit down!

77
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,730
I didn't finish yet! In
front of our factory,

78
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,750
there is a store that sells
cooked ramen 24 hours a day.

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,490
That store sells hotteok (<I>A KIND OF SWEET
HOT PANCAKE</I>) in the cold winter time.

80
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,910
By the way, when they cook hotteok,
they flip only once, not twice!

81
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,910
The hotteok is
flipped just once.

82
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,470
Is Korean Law inferior to a
hotteok that it is flipped twice?

83
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,510
Remove him from the courtroom.

84
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,930
These people are
crying right now.

85
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,590
Yes? Leave me alone!

86
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,367
Is it so difficult to
say one word, to say

87
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,210
you're sorry to people
whom you made to cry?

88
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,890
Leave me alone! Aisii!

89
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,870
Apologize! Apologize quickly!

90
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,910
Sang Pil!

91
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,210
Sang Pil.

92
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,110
Why? Will it demean the
judge's honor to apologize?

93
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,910
Do you feel ashamed?

94
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,830
We live with constant begging
because apologizing is not enough.

95
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,230
We are begging a money lender, begging
not to stop the water service,

96
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,490
begging a wife who
wants to divorce,

97
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,550
and begging our kids
who ask for tuition.

98
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,290
You cut our life line like this.

99
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,830
Is it so hard to say even
one word of apology?

100
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,210
- Remove him.<br> -Apologize.

101
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,750
<i>Take him out. Quickly!</i>

102
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,490
Judges! Apologize!

103
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,050
"Sorry that the law can't
take care of you."

104
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,110
Say that!

105
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,950
Say, "Very sorry that the
law didn't protect you."

106
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,910
Why do you do that?

107
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,890
APOLOGIZE!

108
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,550
Why do you come here?

109
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,550
Are you doing well?

110
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,530
Do you think I am doing well?

111
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,680
How is going for you to
become police officer,

112
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:01,670
which you said you
were studying for?

113
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,950
Not yet.

114
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,910
If you have time to come here,
then study one more word instead.

115
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,030
Dad.

116
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,270
Now, you will stop, won't you?

117
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,310
- Gyu Hwan.<br>- Yes?

118
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,090
Your father is not me,

119
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,550
but the guy who raised you
along with your mother.

120
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,310
The way I see it, it's not something
that you should be concerned about.

121
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,450
<i>Reversal of the original judgment. From
law office team leader Park Chang Ho.</i>

122
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,710
It worked out better
than I thought.

123
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,990
A CEO who is generous to the people who
were fired, despite winning the suit.

124
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,050
I can't do it. Even though the
grave's dirt comes into my eyes.

125
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,610
Absolutely not.

126
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,870
Then, I can't help. Please
find another consultant.

127
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,210
Party nomination.

128
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,842
You don't have to help me
with the campaign but help me

129
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:23,510
so that I can get the nomination
from the ruling party.

130
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,070
Being nominated is harder than winning
an election in Korea politics.

131
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,710
With your present resume,

132
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,610
you will be dropped in the
preliminary election.

133
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,275
I know you were at BH not
very long ago.<br>(<i>BH: The

134
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:37,710
Blue House, office of
the President of Korea</i>)

135
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,330
Were you the senior administrative
officer for political affairs?

136
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,010
So?

137
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,610
Shouldn't the rulling party
nominate if BH approves?

138
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,250
Please intercede with the Blue
House political affairs office.

139
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:55,810
For a fee, I brought a big one.

140
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,330
If the result comes out well,

141
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,310
I will give another big
one as an incentive.

142
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,090
What do you think?

143
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,550
We must do politics
like this, very boldly.

144
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,870
According Public Officers
Election Act 47-2-1,

145
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,210
no one shall offer, declare an intention
to offer, or promise to offer

146
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,130
money, articles, other property
or a public or private position

147
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,150
to obtain a political party's
recommendation of a candidate.

148
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,690
Aigoo, why are you
being so scary?

149
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,170
Are you going to complain
to the prosecutors?

150
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,910
I am also friendly
with the prosecutors.

151
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,710
If you know the prosecutors,

152
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,177
please select from the
Central Election Commission,

153
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:33,430
the Civil Affairs Office
in the Blue House, and

154
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,310
the Nationalist Party's
Nomination Screening Committee.

155
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,590
You are the style of person who
tells a joke seriously and long.

156
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,490
Do you have proof?

157
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,770
The entire process of consulting
with a client is recorded.

158
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,330
Didn't I tell you about
this at the first meeting?

159
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,300
If you would humbly listen
to my last advice...

160
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,890
this won't be getting a ride on a
quick delivery service motorcycle.

161
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,130
Say it. I will
listen attentively.

162
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,460
Get lost from Yeouido (KOREAN EQUIVALENT
OF CAPITOL HILL) right now, you jerk!

163
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,940
This is an incentive.

164
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,670
This is how politics is
done, very transparently.

165
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,079
The landlord called earlier
and said if this month's

166
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:37,900
rent is in arrears too,
an eviction will start.

167
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,460
It's a scary world. Now even resignations
are sent in a certified format.

168
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,920
President!

169
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,764
-Don't worry. Starting
next week, I will

the program head would reject you?

Why would the Program
Head?<br>Why would that guy... ?

175

It's not a thing to get mad
at the Program Head for.

-Go plead to Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi.<br>-Who?

177
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,089
Assemblywoman Hong told the
program head not to make

different assemblymen.

179

it all to herself.

In the past, she might have
followed you around campaigning.

183
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,130
But now, she is an assemblywoman
and you are just a vendor.

Hey, PD Park!

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,860
Anyway, the only one who can change
Program Head's mind is Hong Chan Mi, OK?

186
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,930
You, what did you say
at the beginning?

187
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,740
Didn't you say your program head okays
everything as long as it's a pretty woman?

review before the meeting.

196

She said she was really sorry.

197

Did she say she didn't
want to see me?

198

this just one more time?

brings too many thoughts.

00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,310
Perhaps, do you work
for the government?

335
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,170
A long time ago, I was there for a few
years. Why? You want to beat me up?

336
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,540
No, it's not that but I
wanted to ask you something.

337
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,820
Assemblymen are said to fight in front of
cameras like a matter of life and death...

338
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,770
But when they're by themselves,
they supposedly call one

339
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,900
another brothers and play together.
Is that really the case?

340
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,020
-You are curious
about that?<br>-Yes.

341
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,074
Hyung, why are you asking
about those things

342
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:28,290
when you know that it will
make her embarrassed.

343
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,330
I know you guys have lot of
resentment against Assemblymen but

344
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,750
I can't stand that you're
lumping the 300 members

345
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,950
of the Assembly together
and condemning them!

346
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,618
It's true that there are a lot
of ridiculous members, but there

347
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,310
are also a lot of members who think
about the nation and people.

348
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,800
-Then what about us?<br>-What?

349
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,078
When there are so many
assemblymen concerned

350
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,380
with the people, why did
we end up like this?

351
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,400
Are we not people, but animals?
Are we dogs?<br>Dogs? Woof woof?

352
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,040
That is being unreasonable.<br>The problem
with your employer is just...

353
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,020
Yes, enough already.

354
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,930
Why? Let's hear her out.
Tell us.

355
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,370
Why listen? It's
same old bullsh*t.

356
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,630
What? Look here!

357
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,500
Choi In Kyung,

358
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,890
What? Same old bullsh*t?

359
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,300
How dare he when he looks
like shriveled old daikon?

<i>Sunbaenim Baek Do Hyeon</i>

361

ought to give you a minute of my time.</i>

363
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,700
I recorded it out of habit,
but I felt sorry for them.

364
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,390
How frustrated must they be to
do something that nonsensical.

365
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,810
<i>Assemblyman Yang Sung Gil!
Come out!</i>

366
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,520
We had times like this before.

367
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,830
Do you meet with people
within our circle?

368
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,210
They're all busy
making a living.

369
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,550
We think differently from the school
days.<br>We don't see one another often.

370
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,730
Why did you hesitate
to contact me?

371
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,590
Just because.<br>I'm trying
to stand on my own.

372
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,233

Assistant, Planning Team Leader in

373
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:13,790
the Presidential Campaign Office,
Senior Officer in the Blue House...

374
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,200
I didn't get any one
of them on my own.

375
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,884
Before it is too late,
I want to live as Choi

376
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:21,240
In Kyung and not as
Baek Do Hyeon's kid.

377
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,230
It seems BH has a lot of interest
in the Gyeongjae City election.

378
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,700
(FOR BH) To keep silence is
to be helpful, but any way...

379
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,170
-Did BH tell you to give the nomination
to someone in particular?<br>-Yes.

380
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,820
The person who dismissed you.

381
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,700
Ko Yang Ho?

382
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,600
Once in the National Assembly,
that guy will try to be your boss.

383
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,865
Even now, I have a lot of bosses.
The Party Leader, the Party

384
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:51,260
Parliamentary Leader, the Party
Leadership Committee Chairman...

385
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,590
Not those bosses in name only...

386
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,500
Ko Yang Ho is the VIP's (PRESIDENT)
bestie and a big shot in his own way.

387
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,934
Even when he was the
secretary, he considered

388
00:23:57,946 --> 00:23:59,171
the ruling party as
the Yeouido branch

389
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:01,740
office of the Blue House. If he puts on
the badge, how much worse will he become?

390
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,030
He may try to replace me as the
acting leader of the Pro-BH faction.

391
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,020
Of course.

392
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:14,010
If it's the response you're thinking
about... Ko Yang Ho will veto it.

393
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:18,170
Do you really mean it?

394
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,184
Instead I'm going to
nominate a fresh person

395
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:23,470
untainted by the old status
quo for Gyeongjae City.

396
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,630
Then, the people will like it.

397
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,280
Now, let's eat.

398
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,600
Yes.

399
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,070

402

You could have gone to jail.

Aish, eat without

410
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,190
Did I sputter?

411
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,966
By the way, Hyung-nim,
now what do we do?<br>We've

412
00:25:06,978 --> 00:25:09,220
even lost the suit.
Can we keep fighting?

413
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,620
Speaking of which, I was a bit late
because we were talking about that.

414
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,040
Assemblywoman Cheon,
please speak.

415
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,620
Now, Assemblywoman
Cheon will speak.

416
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,320
Everybody must know that by-elections
will be held next month.

417
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,963
Our Sahwae (SOCIALIST) Party
decided to nominate single

Korea Democratic Party.

allotted to us (<i>only one Sawhae

421
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,170

have to do with us?

494
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,140
What, no insurance?

495
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,570
I am really sorry.

496
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,080
Ah, really, wait and see if I
will leave this company alone.

497
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,170
Here, just a minute.

498
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,980
Why are you doing this?

499
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,090
Please give me just one break.

500
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,430
I am preparing to
take the police exam.

501
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,490
I don't think I can
afford to be reported.

502
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,230
How about the
damages I suffered?

503
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,330
Do you know how much money
I will end up forking out?

504
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,530
I'll pay you back as soon as possible.
I mean it.

505
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,490
<i>Gookmin Party Stops
Screening Nominees</i>

506
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,970
Stop screening nominees?

507
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,890
<i>Because of a lack of
suitable candidates</i>

508
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,970
they would stop screening? Where
have you seen such unreasonableness?

509
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,830
This is, in order to make a
strategic nomination later,

510
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,350
amassing unreasonable excuses.

511
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,310
As evidence...

512
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,550
Over there the Secretary General
is coming!<br>Secretary General!

513
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,195
What do you think about
the allegation that this

514
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:53,830
is just taking steps for
a strategic nomination?

515
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,770
I guess it depends on
how you look at it.

516
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,261
Is the rumor that the BH
had a say in the Pro-BH

517
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,930
faction's insistence on a
strategic nomination true?

518
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,070
A party nomination is made by the
party, not by the Blue House.

519
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,330
-Just one more
question!<br>-Just a moment!

520
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,170
Sunbae-nim, it's me.

521
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,230
Oh, yes, In Kyung.

522
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,650
What you said about
vetoing Ko Yang Ho...

523
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,930
Are you of the same
mind even now?

524
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,070
Once I find an alternative, I will
knock him down on the very same day.

525
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,930
Sunbae-nim...

526
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,350
Perhaps, that alternative...

527
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,330
being me, what do you
think about that?

528
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,140
I have no ties to
Gyeongjae City, but

529
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,690
I don't think that is a
decisive disadvantage.

530
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,470
I have built up enough experience
and I also have vision and passion.

531
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,710
- In Kyung... <br> - I will give
up on self sufficiency.

532
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,890
The strategic nomination
you will give...

533
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,810
I want to receive it.

534
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,627
I'm Korean Democratic Party
Parliamentary Senior

535
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:04,190
Vice President, Assemblyman
Cho Woong Kyu.

536
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,411
I am in charge of
coalition with the other

537
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,770
opposition party, the
Sahwae (SOCIALIST) Party.

538
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,210
I heard that, Chairman, you have
not yet made up your mind to run.

539
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,490
So I came running.

540
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,350
A guy who has hurt his leg on a plumbing
job and barely operates forklifts...

541
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,630
How can a guy like that
do something like this?

542
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,330
You are more than capable.

543
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,850
Hyung Dal Soo, what are you going
to do about Hyung Sung Gi?

544
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,270
Hyung-nim, I'm asking you what you're
going to do about Hyung Sung Gi.

545
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,570
Just hold for a bit.<br>I'm
talking with the assemblyman.

546
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:47,270
Is is true that you've been a
welder for 30 years?<br>Haigoo!

547
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,970
Now, do you call this welding?

548
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:57,190
I'm sorry. I've had such a
long period of inactivity...

549
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,030
Byeon Sung Gi.

550
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,970
You're here, huh?<br>Come
out quickly.

551
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,410
-No...<br>-Where, where
are you going?!

552
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,721
Byeon Sung Gi, won't
you come here!<br>Byeon

553
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,230
Sung Gi, won't you come here?

554
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,750
Byeon Sung Gi!

555
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,070
Seriously!

556
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,410
Byeon Sung Gi!

557
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,950
Look here, Ahjussi!

558
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,790
Why?

559
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,210
I have to finish
the job by today.

560
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,870
What will I do if you chase
away the part-timer?

561
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:53,990
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
brought to you by The Assembly Team @ Viki</i>

562
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,790
I guess you had a drink?

563
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,510
No.

564
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,270
Now, the reason I asked
you to gather like this

565
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,610
is I think I'll have to run.

566
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,690
Everyone must know that I'm not
doing this out of any greed.

567
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,670
If we are to bring new development
to the fight, no matter what...

568
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,350
What new development?

569
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,539
When they are throwing fits, cutting
off electricity and forcefully

570
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:45,590
removing tents, at the mere mention
of running in the election?

571
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,110
If you run and lose
and come back,

572
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,690
what do you think those
bastards would do?

573
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,370
-But there is no other way.<br>-What
do you mean no other way?

574
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,370
Let's just make a deal
with the company.

575
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,851
We will acknowledge the
layoff and wrap up the

576
00:34:56,863 --> 00:34:59,410
fight, and they will
discontinue their suits and

577
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,790
- just give us some compensation money.
Let's do that.<br>- Forget it!

578
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,810
Why would we beg now after suffering
so much all this time for our cause?

579
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,450
Hyung-nim!

580
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,330
Even if we do, they are
not going to listen.

581
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,450
-Let's just talk about the
election today.<br>-What election?

582
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,550
If we run in the election, do you
think something will change?

583
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,850
Why don't you acknowledge

584
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,150
that it's a chance to let
the people know about us?

585
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,610
You mean not us, but you!

586
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,250
What did you say?

587
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,890
Do you know how many days it has
been since Hyung Sung Gi left?

588
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,814
Do you or don't you know
about these people sniveling

589
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:27,690
every night since the big
loss at the Supreme Court?

590
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,699
Since you're getting business cards and
good treatment from this party man and

591
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,630
that party man, you are not even concerned
about those sorts of things now!

592
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,950
It's like you've
become somebody!

593
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,050
Punk!

594
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,250
Aigoo, Chairman!<br>Chairman!
Why are you like this?

595
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,570
-Ah, really.<br>-How can you

596
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,930
say such a thing
to me, punk, huh?

597
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,850
Overlook this.

598
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,270
Now I'm not going to fight
for worker's rights.

599
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,490
Good bye, all.

600
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,970
Hey, look.<br>Hey, Sang Pil!

601
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:09,170
Sang Pil, why are you
doing this, really?

602
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,730
Why did you do that, Hyung-nim?

603
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,290
Sang Pil, Jin Sang Pil!

604
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,090
Vice Chairman Jin.

605
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,550
Let go of me.

606
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,370
<i>The strategic nomination
you will give...</i>

607
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,090
<i>I want to receive it.</i>

608
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:41,390
Aigoo, look who is here.

609
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,130
Welcome, Secretary General Baek.

610
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,970
They say people play baduk
according to their personalities.

611
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,730
Your stones move very neatly.

612
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:09,010
As for me, I've only
learned the baduk fight.

613
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,250
It has become a gonma
(HARD TO SAVE STONE).

614
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,070
It's as if I am looking at myself
sitting on the Nominee Screening Panel.

615
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,890
If you hold on to a hot
potato like Ko Yang Ho,

616
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,290
you'll only end up
burning your hand.

617
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,630
I'm telling you this
because I care about you.

618
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,750
Just use me or the Anti-BH
faction as your excuse

619
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,450
and drop him.

620
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,670
After that, what?

621
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,250
There is a person that
Assemblyman Kang is pushing for.

622
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,630
The former mayor
of Gyeongjae City.

623
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,070
He is of the old school.

624
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:53,710
Gyeongjae City is where Yang Sung
Gil lorded it over for 12 years.

625
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,010
And Yang Sung Gil was one of us.

626
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,725
It's my conviction that
party nominations shared

627
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:01,130
according to the faction
line are outdated.

628
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:09,650
Politics will become too inflexible if
you place conviction above all others.

629
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,790
Secretary General Baek...

630
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,550
conviction is there
for you to bend.

631
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,210
If you detach yourself from a party
nomination for Gyeongjae City,

632
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,170
I will make Ko Yang Ho cave in.

633
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,770
While you are knocking down rivals
and devouring Gyeongjae City,

634
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,350
you are telling me I should content myself
with not having to see Ko Yang Ho's face?

635
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:40,170
This, it's such a short
end of the stick.

636
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:46,310
If you say no, you'll hear Ko Yang Ho
announcing his candidacy this evening.

637
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,830
The baduk game will
become a bit messy.

638
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,158
<i>In connection with the
rumor of the Blue House's</i>

639
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,650
<i>interference with the
party nomination,</i>

640
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:11,390
<i>Assemblyman Kang Sang Ho, a
prominent figure from the Anti-BH</i>

641
00:39:11,402 --> 00:39:14,510
<i>faction, accused the Blue House of
an explicit exercise of influence.</i>

642
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,655
<i>Assemblyman Kang pointed to Ko Yang
Ho, the former Secretary to the</i>

643
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,950
<i>President for Political Affairs, as
the person chosen by the Blue House.</i>

644
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,228
<i>And he is calling for resignation
of Secretary General</i>

645
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,710
<i>Baek Do Hyeon, who is heading
the Nominee Screening Panel.</i>

646
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:31,090
These people aren't even in
Mak Ga Pa (KOREAN GANG).

647
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,478
What should we do? People's
sentiment will get worse, since

648
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,650
we're fighting for the
government office from outside.

649
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,190
We can also get through in a new place
and not in the city of Gyeongjae.

650
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,950
When that happens, then the
seat numbers of the ruling

651
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,670
party and the opposition
parties will become 150:150.

652
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,470
We'll lose the party position that
we've maintained for 3 years.

653
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,590
If the ruling majority and opposing
minority status is altered,

654
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,210
you know the next step is resignation
by all party leadership, right?

655
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,840
<i>BH2</i>

656
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,050
<i>It's because you're dillydallying that
the Anti-BH faction is acting so smugly!</i>

657
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,259
<i>Even if you have to
force and rush it,</i>

658
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,890
<i>nominate Ko Yang Ho before

announcement of not
running in the election.

suffering from a chronic illness.

out of insubordination but

out of our loyalty to keep
the majority government.

Oh Se Chang, the former

but lost out to a
mainstream member. Why?

803
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,600
He did not lose out, but supposedly gave it
up after getting our Big Boss's promise.

804
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,510
What promise?

805
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,070
That he would get to nest in

a lousy cigarette now?

823
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:49,530
Chairman! Come out and
see!<br>Vice Chairman Jin is here!

824
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,440
Have you been well?

825
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,240
Yes, have you at least
been eating regularly?

826
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,600
Yes.

827
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,910
Where have you been, punk,
to return only now?

828
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,980
I'm back from selling a kidney.

829
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,240
But they gave me a bit.

830
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,450
Let's barbecue some meat the
first time in a long while.

831
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,430
Yes!

832
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:31,080
<i>Today, it's a daisy.</i>

833
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:36,120
<i>Tomorrow, it will be a rose.</i>

834
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:41,190
<i>Making passes, passes, passes,
you must fall asleep.</i>

835
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:43,940
<i>Now, I'm tired, bumblebee.
Bumblebee!</i>

836
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,160
<i>Tired of waiting, bumblebee.
Bumblebee!</i>

837
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,940
<i>Alone, this night is
so, so cold.<br>-Cheers!</i>

838
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,290
<i>Aish, really!</i>

839
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,030
<i>Yummy!</i>

840
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,260
-It's yummy, right?<br>-Yes.

841
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,550
<i>You're incorrigible bumblebee.</i>

842
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,690
<i>Bumblebee! Even though I</i>

843
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:09,560
<i>resent you, I love you so, so much.
Bumblebee!</i>

844
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,910
What are you doing here alone?

845
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,150
It's comfortable, being alone.

846
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,540
I needed to think about something.

847
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:56,320
Hyungnim, there is something
I want to tell you.

848
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,870
Sang Pil,

849
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:08,400
there's something I want to ask of you.

850
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,790
What is it?

851
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,130
The elections...

852
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,430
you should run.

853
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:20,580
I'll hand down the chairman position
to you, so please run in my place.

854
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:24,410
Ah, don't talk nonsense.

855
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:29,460
Sang Pil! Look at me, with a bad leg
like this, I've even been divorced.

856
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,170
Why are you saying that right now?

857
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:37,280
If a guy like me crawls out there and asks
for votes, who's going to vote for him?

858
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,000
Got divorced by a cheating
wife and his only son...

859
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,650
To keep him from being called a cripple's
son, if he gave up his parental rights...

860
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:47,460
When told this, who in the
world will vote for me?

861
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,990
Tell them not to if they don't want to!

862
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:53,710
Are you going out there to win? What's
important is that you're participating.

863
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:59,130
Even if I lose, I should gain
a lot of votes and lose.

864
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,910
We need to gain even one more
vote so those people get scared.

865
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:08,090
When we rake in even one more vote,
this deaf-like world will listen.

866
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,920
Even if they're pretending, we
need to do at least that much.

867
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,680
Sang Pil...

868
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:20,240
after the election, no matter what
you do, I won't say anything.

869
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:27,650
So my wish, please, fulfill it.
Huh?

870
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,790
These are the ARS research results
from 500 people in the district.

871
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:49,810
Baek Do Hyeon 28, Oh Sae Chang 59.

872
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:54,270
The more serious problem is,
starting next month, people will

873
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,770
move into the apartment complexes you
attracted to the newly planned city.

874
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,295
The demographic is mostly composed of
thirty- and forty-something renters moving

875
00:53:58,307 --> 00:54:00,750
in from the outskirts of Seoul and large
supporters of the opposition parties.

876
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,470
When it rains, it pours.

877
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:04,038
In any event, it would
be best to run in next

878
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,630
year's election from a
different constituency-

879
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,880
What you're saying!

880
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,063
Does that make sense right now?
You're telling me to

881
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:13,170
betray the people who
supported me all this time?

882
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,940
I'm sorry.

883
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,850
Leave.

884
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,310
<i> Opposition, Labor Candidate
for Gyeongjae City Nomination</i>

885
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,008
<i>As opposition parties'
nominee for Gyeongjae</i>

886
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,500
<i>City, where they face
absolute disadvantages,</i>

887
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,857
<i>there is news of Mr. Jin Sang
Pil, the Chairman of Hansujo</i>

888
00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:45,520
<i>Committee to Recover Lost Jobs,
fast rising as a strong contender.</i>

889
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,720
<i>Are you kidding me?<br>You
won't put this away?</i>

890
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,640
<i>Mr. Jin Sang Pil was born in Gyeonggi
Province.<br>He did not finish high school,</i>

891
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,661
<i>but entered Korea Shipbuilding
&amp; Repairs Co.</i>

892
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:56,540
<i>and worked there as a
welder for 20 years...</i>

893
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,530
Tomorrow, the opposition party members
said they'd come to get a firm answer.

894
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,920
You don't need to worry about other
things, but just say one word, "OK."

895
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,380
Everything else I'll take care of, got it?

896
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,570
Yes.

897
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:14,020
Sang Pil! No... Chairman,
you have a visitor.

898
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,690
Visitor? Who?

899
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,520
Who are you?

900
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,590
Hello, I should introduce myself...

901
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,500
My name is Choi In Kyung.

902
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,080
Oh, yes.

903
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,810
You remember me, right?

904
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:41,710
What?

905
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,557
At the police station, the
same vegetables to the

906
00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:45,280
same rice (GARDEN-VARIETY,
SAME OLD SAME OLD).

907
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,180
Ah, right!

908
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,120
But why are you here, Ahjumma?

909
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,310
You know this is a hotel, right?

910
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:07,980
Don't imagine anything wierd...
I wanted to meet quietly.

911
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,820
Who is it, someone who, in
the middle of the night...

912
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:16,300
You're really not trying to do
something weird to me, right?

913
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,330
Just follow me.

914
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:24,570
This is weird.

915
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,900
I have brought Jin Sang Pil.

916
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,920
Hello,

917
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,860
I am the KMT (NATIONALIST PARTY)
Secretary General, Baek Do Hyeon.

918
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,520
Of course I know you;
you're a famous person.

919
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,970
I'm sorry for bringing you here
in the middle of the night.

920
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:59,360
In Kyung, could you leave us for a moment?

921
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:02,060
Yes.

922
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,640
<i>Please sit.</i>

923
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,180
Yes.

924
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,200
What is it that you want to tell me?

925
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,630
I'll get to the point.

926
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:39,700
The offer to become the opposition
parties' single candidate...<br>Decline it.

927
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,810
Hey.

928
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:44,460
I am hoping that you, Chairman,

929
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,640
would run as our Gookmin Party nominee.

930
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,266
I would like to give you
a strategic nomination

931
00:57:51,278 --> 00:57:54,310
to run as our Gookmin
Party's candidate.

932
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,160
What did you say?

933
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,120
<i>Preview </i>

934
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:18,110
<i>Whom you have in mind, you can
tell me at least that much, right?</i>

935
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,100
<i>- Make a deal with the
company.<br>- What are</i>

936
00:58:20,112 --> 00:58:21,940
<i>you going to do for us
after the election?</i>

937
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,640
<i>Why is it that person?</i>

938
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,727
<i>In the beginning, most
people decline, but I've</i>

939
00:58:25,739 --> 00:58:27,620
<i>never seen someone
decline until the end...</i>

940
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,040
<i>That removal... Secretary
General Baek ordered it, right?</i>

941
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,830
<i>Politics is not something that easy.</i>

942
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,310
<i>It is really right for me to do this?</i>

943
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:37,300
<i>In politics, what's more important
than experience is character.</i>

944
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,850
<i>Jin Sang Pil is garbage.</i>

945
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,330
<i>I have to do well.</i>

946
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:44,700
<i>Then do well! I said do well!</i>
