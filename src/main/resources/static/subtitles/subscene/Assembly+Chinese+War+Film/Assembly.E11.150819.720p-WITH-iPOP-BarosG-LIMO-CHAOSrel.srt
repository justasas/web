I can look there

From now on, when the
party decides something,

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,860
make sure to discuss it with
the Indifferent-to-BH faction.

Response from the Pro- and Anti-BH

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,350
-Jin Sang... <br> -
Enough already.

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,490
Instead of articles from the internet,
are there any articles in the newspaper?

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,281
Oh, today, the politics

28
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:22,570

the articles about

Minister in a cabinet meeting about

30
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,830
the inadequate measures to
stimulate the real estate market.

31
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,530

Gook Daily.<br>- What did it say?

Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil...

33
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,870
We somewhat expected
this kind of response.

Now, this is only the beginning.

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,730
Yes, there were a few scheduled
intra-party meetings and appointments,

00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,430
but everyone cancelled.

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,350

00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,250
No, well, this was expected.

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,190
Still, I feel a bit... you know...
With my term ending soon and all...

43
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,450
But is Secretary Kim ill or something? Why
did he ask for a day off all of a sudden?

44
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,130
He said he was going to go somewhere
so I told him to rest for a day.

this time, I cannot help but
be on the Blue House's side.

63
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,170
Our real estate market is in a
brain-dead condition right now.

64
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,550
Transactions are halted.

65
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,510
In a word, it has gone batsh*t,
that's what I'm saying!

66
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,990
With the paltry policies that the
government is fidgeting with right now,

67
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,870
do you think we can revive
our real estate market?

68
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,430
A snowball's chance in hell!

69
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,490
Prime Minister, you have to be
ashamed of yourself and wake up!

70
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,930
A while ago, the President said

71
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,890
if you're going to do
something do it right.

72
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,796

Minister been a government

Not right now. Hold it in.

81
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,410
But, you know, that Avatar
of the Anti-BH faction.

82
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,270
He is strange today. He's
being a Pro-BH copycat.

83
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,344
Since it's a policy
discussion, they are voicing

84

various ideas, irrespective
of the factions.

85

For today, zip up your mouth and
just listen no matter what.

86
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,010
This isn't right.

87
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,950
As for me, I have
a different idea.

88
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,251
We should not just gripe
to the Prime Minister

89
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,330
but also think about
why he is doing that.

90
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,750
Real estate, this thing... If
we touch it half-heartedly,

91
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,470
the market may overheat
and cause speculation.

92
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,310
Agreed!

<i>Fostering speculation</i>

94
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,110
Real estate transactions, this. We
can't unregulate them too much.

95
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,401
Even now, there is an uproar
over rising key deposits

96
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,630
for long term leases and if
the housing prices soar,

97
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,950
that's like forgoing next
year's general election.

98
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,724
I understand that the Blue
House is obsessing over its

99
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:09,370
track record but this is not
the time to touch this.

100
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,750
Agreed!

<i>Not studying the

102
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,170

103
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,870
Yes. Let's go eat.

106
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,366

things down really hard.

107
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:36,530
If I give you a chance,
will you speak up?

108
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,930
Why behave in a way
so unusual for you?

109
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,468
Didn't you ask the party
to discuss things in

110
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,030
the future with the
Indifferent-to-BH faction?

111
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,730
Indifferent-to-BH my butt.

112
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,770
Stop wasting time and
get out of the party!

113
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,750
Are you playing
around right now?

114
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,070
I don't have anything to say.

115
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,440
What a goof-off.

116
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,950
If you don't know, just say you don't
know and don't feign indifference.

117
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,090
Now, then, we will conclude the
Gookmin Party general meeting.

118
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,100
Aigo, let's go.

119
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,770
What? Put your
assemblyman on the show?

120
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,270
Yes, I have to raise him to
be on a national scale, too.

123
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,372
This kid is trying to zap
it when I've finally

124
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:28,190

the viewer ratings.

125
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,830

you don't know this.

126
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,384
My old man... He is,
unbeknownst to others, pretty

127
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:37,610
good with words and very
sensible, you know?

128
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,770
Really?

129
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,150
Your assemblyman is a no-go
because of low recognition.

130
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,190
He also has a severely
dislikable image, okay?

131
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,130
Hey, hey, hey, that's why he has
to be on TV to get recognized

132
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,510
and to change his image, too?
Huh, friend?

133
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,210
Since I'm your friend,
I'll tell you something.

134
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,580
Hey, friend, snap out of it.

135
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,250

(SOMETHING A LOT STRONGER).

136
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,610
Assemblyman Jin, rat's ass.
What can he get done?

137
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:18,250

conflict between the
President and Prime Minister

156
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,480
is a lot more serious than
assumed by outsiders.

157
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,460
From now on, we don't know what
might happen so start studying.

158
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,666
But this issue... I saw
other assemblymen objecting

159
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:47,400
to it and doing well in
the general meeting?

160
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,720
- Let's do something else instead.<br>-What
do you mean something else?

161
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,601
You know those issues where
the Pro- and Anti-BH go for

162
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:55,540
each other's throat and things
go to the dogs and such...

163
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,787
- Assemblyman.<br>- But,
aside from visiting my

164
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,200
constituency, I haven't
gotten anything done today.

165
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,640
If we pass one, two days like this,
that's all just wasted time.

00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,860
because of your declaration
of indifference.

168
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,430
If you just poke around
anywhere out of a sense

169
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,860
of urgency, you'll end
up a laughing stock.

170
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,660
So I have to wait
no matter what?

171
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,660
If you wait, you will
be given a chance.

172
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,500
How long do I have to wait?

174
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,830
I'm back.

175
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,730
Ah, did you take care
of your business?

176
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,300
Yes. I'm turning in.

177
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,160
What is it? Is something up?

178
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,570
- No. <br> - There
isn't something?

179
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,200
I see it written
all over your mug.

180
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,170
- That's not so. <br> - Hey,
tell me what's bugging you.

181
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,650
What did you take a break for?

182
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,520
It's none of your business.

183
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,520
Hey, you're acting cocky again.

184
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,500
Whoopee.

185
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,250
Why are you harassing me?

186
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,360
Harassing?

187
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,240
Are you dissing me now because
you've done some martial arts?

188
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,430
I was also into
boxing before, punk.

189
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,430
Swoosh! Do you think that sound
just came from my mouth, now? Hey.

190
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,500
Phooey, huh? Take this, punk.

191
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,440
That's what I was aiming for, punk.
Why are you just standing there?

192
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,110
So you can't let down
your guard, punk.

193
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,350
How was that, huh? Hey.

194
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,060
Go for it. Hey.

195
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,790
Hey Punk.

196
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,370
Hey, now...

197
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,160
It was sparring but
really, this...

198
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,300
You should loosen up sometimes.
Young kid.

199
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,150
You always have a
frown on your face.

200
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,700
Turn in and relax.

201
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,051
-Assemblyman. <br> - What is it?
You want to

202
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:38,480
go for a round? Huh?
Want to do that?

203
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,530
Will I be drafting a bill also?

204
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,740
Bill? Which bill?

205
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,380
Can I?

206
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,940
If you insist on working but,

207
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,140
do you know how to do
something like that?

208
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,920
I will try.

209
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,360
By the way, Assemblyman.

210
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,990
What else?

211
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,930
- Assemblyman, your boxing... <br>
- Yeah.

212
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,630
is garbage.

213
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,360
Hey. You come over here.

214
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,210
Hey, let's go at it properly.
Aren't you coming? Hey!

215
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,100
Hey, quickly go buy
headgear and mouthguards.

nomination to me, do</i>

<i>I think tomorrow's Gyeongje District
meeting will be very interesting.</i>

222
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,900
<i>If he's faced with a vote of no confidence,
how will Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil act?</i>

223
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,790
Were you looking for
me, Secretary General?

224
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,700
Among local party chapters,
give me the status sheets

225
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,850
for those areas overrun
by the Anti-BH faction.

226
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,590
May I ask why?

227
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,260
The chapters without much activity
and existing only in name...

228
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,130
I will either revoke their charters
or sanction their presidents.

229
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,740
At a minimum, more
than 10 of them.

230
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,390
Schedule a meeting with
the Audit Team Leader.

231
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,110
Yes, I understand.

232
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,000
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

233
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,010
Big trouble!

234
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,430
What do you mean big trouble?

235
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,340
This is what I heard from my straw (SOURCE)
working in the party administration office.

236
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,800
As soon as this special
session ends, Baek Do Hyeon

237
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,050
is going to audit the local party
chapters all over the country.

238
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,940
This, for sure, is revenge

239
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,497
for the local party
members' general meeting

240
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,850
we pushed in Gyeongje
City the last time.

241
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,510
This dude is countering with
a super powerful move...

242
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,520
If it is to this extent,

243
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,030
shouldn't we also enter
into war preparations?

244
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,090
Should I issue a DEFCON 3?

245
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,190
Auditing local chapters,
does that make any sense?

246
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,040
Secretary Kim, what's going on?

247
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,460
... then, "hey punk, how can
you manhandle an assemblyman?"

248
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,120
Saying that, you should break
through and strongly demand...

249
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,660
Push through no
matter what, okay?

250
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,560
If even that doesn't work,
then, I will come and just...

251
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,040
Write it down. I won't accept
anything not in writing.

252
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,633
Please summarize the common and
different points between the

253
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,990
President and Prime Minister over
the real estate market policy.

254
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,148
- Since it is going to be used
as the Assemblyman's study

255
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
material, make it as easy as
possible to understand.<br>- Yes.

256
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,140
But the Anti-BH
faction's core people

257
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,060
were flocking to Assemblyman
Kang Sang Ho's room.

258
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,340
You don't know what
their agenda is?

259
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,060
No, I asked a hoobae of
mine in a roundabout way,

260
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,660
but he said he did
not know either.

261
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,079
Oh? The middle bosses of
the Pro-BH faction were

262
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:39,820
swarming at Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi's office too.

263
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,870
Have you seen who were going in?

264
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,190
Yes, roughly.

265
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,680
Not to provide a pretext for
the Anti-BH faction to resist,

266
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,990
we have to show them our active
participation in the audit.

267
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,120
<i>It is a call from
Assemblyman Heo Dae Il.</i>

268
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,080
Yes, Assemblyman. Why
are you not here?

269
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,540
Oh, yes, Assemblywoman Hong.

270
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,970
Today, I am feeling
under the weather.

271
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,650
But what have you gathered
to talk about today?

272
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,210
The Secretary General is performing
an audit of the local party chapters.

273
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,000
We are discussing
ways to support him.

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,640
Oh, really? If that is the occasion,
I should have made it somehow.

275
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,790
But my health is so poor...

276
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,190
No, Assemblyman. I will let you know
later, so take care of yourself.

277
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,150
Aigo, thank you.

278
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,070
You did well.

279
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,840
But, then, the Pro- and Anti-BH
factions are now fighting?

280
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,450
Unless some variable interjects
itself, that is how it will play out.

281
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,778
Then, we have to hurry
and make a statement,

282
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,130
in the name of the
Indifferent-to-BH faction.

283
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,627
That they shouldn't engage
in turf battles but

284
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:04,020
look out for the
livelihoods of the people.

285
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,030
Let's go quickly.

286
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,290
Oh, what is it, this time?

287
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,484
It's combat between whales
(GIANTS).<br>(Korean saying:

288
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:12,530
<i>"When whales fight the
krill's back is broken."</i>)

289
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,240
If a krill makes a
public statement,

290
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,590
it can't influence the
current of events.

291
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,600
Am I a krill?

292
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,580
But, then, what is this? Are you
saying we should wait yet again?

293
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,349
In order for the
Indifferent-to-BH to show its

294
00:18:25,361 --> 00:18:27,370
strength, the Pro- and Anti-BH
factions should be one

295
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,270
rather than split up.

296
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,610
Why are you saying
such nonsense?

297
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,790
How can those kids
play nice like that?

298
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,220
You must wait.

299
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,560
Aish, stop saying wait and
come up with some strategy!

300
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,090
It seems like you don't
have any strategy.

301
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,730
At this rate, what if the people forget
about the Indifferent-to-BH and what-not?

302
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,240
The more they forget, the better the
chance that will come your way.

303
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,460
Lay low as much as possible

304
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,190
and until your adversaries have
forgotten about your existence,

305
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,350
quietly lie in wait.

306
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,950
I'm going to die, really. How
can I lower myself even more?

307
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,430
I have conveyed your requests and
messages to the assemblymen.

308
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,390
You worked hard.

309
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,440
So impolite... What
are you doing?

310
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,860
Is it true that you are going to
audit the local party chapters?

311
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,880
Stop smirking and say something!
Yes or no?

312
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,740
It's true.

313
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,180
With the next year's
election coming up,

314
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,986
checking on the status
of local organizations

315
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:28,420
and disciplining
them, if necessary,

316
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,050
isn't that what a secretary general
should do, as a part of his duties?

317
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,370
Now, if your curiosity is
satisfied, why don't you leave?

318
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,060
We can't leave empty-handed.

319
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,767
Guarantee that you will
not target our Anti-BH

320
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:49,210
faction and audit
the hell out of us.

321
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,530
In writing!

322
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,900
Why don't you talk sense.

323
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,020
Where is an audit that excludes a
specific subject even before it starts?

324
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,500
What?

325
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:07,110
If you keep obstructing a proper exercise
of the party rights in this manner,

326
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,870
I will no longer just
sit still and watch it.

327
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,940
Then, do you think

328
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,260
we will just sit still and
watch, Secretary General Baek?

<i>VIP</i>

330
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,840
Yes, Elder.

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,560
What?

332
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,900
Whose call is that for
him to be like that?

Welcome, Secretary General Baek.
When you must be busy...

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,580
what brings you here?

335
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,075
There is a matter about which
I need to consult with

336
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,500
you. There is also a matter
I should thank you for.

337
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,460
Thank me?

338
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,000
Didn't I learn a proper move from
you just a little while ago?

339
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,420
So,

340
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,720
I heard that you were
preparing a gift to repay me.

341
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,820
Didn't you ask for this meeting
in order to declare war?

342
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,020
No, I'm here to
suggest an armistice.

343
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,219
The Elder at the Blue
House must not like the

344
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:22,640
measures the government
has come up with

345
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,860
in order to stimulate
real estate transactions.

346
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,700
Isn't it about time that the government
workers start disobeying him?

347
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,560
The day before yesterday, the polls showed
the administration approval ratings

348
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,480
went down even farther
than last month's.

349
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,160
The Elder wants

350
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,760
the measures that he likes to be
carried as our party platform.

351
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,780
In the eyes of the people,

352
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,460
it may come off as the ruling party
fighting with the Prime Minister.

353
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,480
That armistice...

354
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,340
I will decline it.

355
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,800
You'd better accept my offer.

356
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,780
Auditing of the party chapters... I'm
not afraid of that sort of thing.

357
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,980
Go ahead with it if you want.

358
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,880
And you are not afraid of standing
up against the President?

359
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,060
For a person who is as
important as the President,

360
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:25,620
he should not hold a grudge just because a
policy was not made into a party platform.

361
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,760
Why don't you tell him to just
bring around the Prime Minister?

362
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,780
The Prime Minister...

363
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,357
will spend his last
day at Sejong City

364
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:37,620
(KOREA'S SECOND ADMINISTRATIVE
CAPITAL) today.

365
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,560
What?

366
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,620
When the President's
will is this strong...

367
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,600
will you still decline?

368
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,500
<i>Prime Minister Lee Seung Hwan has
expressed his wish to resign promptly.</i>

369
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,660
<i>Prime Minister Lee, in the statement
announced by his office moments ago,</i>

370
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,033
<i>expressed his keen sense of remorse
at not having risen to the</i>

371
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,240
<i>challenge of economic recovery,
the people's fervent wish,</i>

372
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,900
<i>and announced his resignation.</i>

373
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,649
<i>The Blue House, in a promptly
released comment, said it was</i>

374
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:08,560
<i>regretful but Prime Minister Lee's
decision would be respected.</i>

375
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,435
<i>With the voluntary resignation
of Prime Minister Lee, who has</i>

376
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:14,240
<i>been cautious about the
government-led market manipulation,</i>

377
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,560
<i>the Seo Dae Han administration
is expected to pursue</i>

378
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,348
<i>- a more aggressive economic
stimulus package...</i><br>-

379
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,660
Is the Prime Minister
thrown out, then?

380
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,420
<i>This has been Jeong
Min Hee of KBC News.</i>

381
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,380
The armistice...

382
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,820
Let's enter into it.

383
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,970
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

384
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,080
Now.

385
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,000
<i>Notice of Gookmin Party
Emergency General Meeting</i>

386
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,017

<i>Minister's Resignation and Status
of Current National Affairs</i>

388
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,560
Tomorrow morning, there will be
an emergency general meeting.

389
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
Umm, I saw it too.

390
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,320
The Prime Minister... it was the
President who fired him, right?

391
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,460
Obviously. Seeing this,

392
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,300
I guess the President
is powerful, after all.

393
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,580
An assemblyman can't
hold a candle to him.

394
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,580
Yes, Aide Choi.

395
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,280
You've received a text message about
tomorrow's general meeting, right?

396
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,620
Yes, I just did.

397
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,520
Finally, the chance

398
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,260
you've been waiting for is here.

399
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,460
A chance is here?

400
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,080
Yes.

401
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,700
<i>Today's General Meeting is in
camera (CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC)</i>

402
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,386
As stated, this bill
minimizes the unnecessary

403
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:54,520
regulations that restrict
real estate transactions.

404
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,663
Not only by aggressively reducing
the transaction fees, but

405
00:24:57,675 --> 00:25:00,620
also by enacting into law the
bases and rules upon which

406
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,660
the government can implement various
measures to catalyze transactions,

407
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,560
it aims at injecting
lifesaving oxygen

408
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,040
into the depressed economy.

409
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,040
With that, I will conclude
my introduction of the bill.

410
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,920
Next, Party Leader Yoon Jung
Soo will come up and speak.

411
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,600
Aide-nim.

412
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,540
Aide-nim.

413
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,480
So unlike you, why
are you so nervous?

414
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
Yeah, I will say...

415
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,840
I'm a bit nervous because the
coup d'état is about to go off.

416
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,220
I am thinking about becoming

417
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,580
the sponsor for this bill just
introduced by Assemblywoman Hong

418
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,880
and getting the signatures
of all Gookmin Party members

419
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,140
to present it as the
official party platform.

420
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,340
What are your thoughts,
Assemblymen?

421
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,160
What thoughts? What need
is there to ask and stuff?

422
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,280
Of course, everyone is for it.
Isn't that so?

423
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,160
Agreed! Agreed!

424
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Let's make it a party platform!

425
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,840
Then, I will think that there is
no objection to this bill and...

426
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,580
Just a minute.

427
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,900
I do have an objection.

428
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,780
No way he'd just let it go...

429
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,420
Just leave me out of the list of the
assemblymen supporting this bill.

430
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,320
What did you say?

431
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,680
What are you saying? We are presenting
it as the party's unified platform!

432
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,060
Don't you understand
there is no exception?

433
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,200
Is this the military? If
it's a party platform,

434
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,260
do I have to accept and gorge myself
whether it's dung or doenjang (SOY PASTE)?

435
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,300
- What?<br>- And, also,

436
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,580
a bill just needs
10 to support it.

437
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,480
Why must all 151
people support it?

438
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,580
Are you showing off the number
to the opposition parties now?

439
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,080
I don't want to be included, so just
get it done amongst yourselves.

440
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,940
Look here, Assemblyman Jin.

441
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,660
I'm busy, so...

442
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,020
Aigo, that wacko, that thing...
I should just!

443
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,300
Look here, Assemblyman Jin!

444
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,320
Hey, over there, grab
Assemblyman Jin!

445
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,400
But, Assemblyman Jin,
why are you doing this?

446
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,980
You're asking me why? Huh?

447
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,320
I jotted down everything that came
out in the last general meeting.

448
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,540
Shall I look at what you two said?
Huh? Oh, it's right here.

449
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,320
Objection to the real estate market getting
overheated and fostering speculation.

450
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,889
Housing prices soaring,
not studying the BH's

451
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:53,620
countenance! You two said
the exactly same things!

452
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,960
At that time, you two were
so fired up, objecting.

453
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,267
If you look at this bill,
those measures you opposed

454
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,160
at that time... Those
are all in here, now.

455
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,400
But why are you two
so quiet, today?

456
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,700
Wiping your mouths like this. Did you
eat some honey (LIPS GLUED TOGETHER)?

457
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,535
And in yesterday's general
meeting, surely one half

458
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:11,180
was opposed while the
other half supported it.

459
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,420
But why is everyone supporting
it today, all of a sudden?

460
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,160
Yes, of course, I understand that you
are scared of falling out of favor

461
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,640
of the party higher-ups and
not getting nominations.

462
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,280
But still we are

463
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,800
so-called, so-called assemblymen,
national assemblymen!

464
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,400
It looks as though

465
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,760
we let down our guard too much.

466
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,360
Ladies and gentlemen of the Assembly,
let's please live with some guts, okay?

467
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,720
Just, just! Are we some employees of the
Gookmin Party Incorporated Company?

468
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,660
Are you an employee?

469
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,420
Executive Baek!

470
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,040
- Look here, Assemblyman Jin.<br>- Oh ho,
let me go. I've done some martial arts.

471
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,180
In the blink of an eye, really.
You'll be surprised.

472
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,780
Seriously, that is a king-sized
wacko, that thing...

473
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,420
Assemblyman Jin!

474
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,920
It sounds as though you are
opposed to the party platform.

475
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,820
Please give us a comment.

476
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,460
It seems like you have an
objection, just one word please.

477
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,580
Assemblyman Jin!
Assemblyman Jin!

478
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,280
It's okay if I talk, right?

479
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,640
Ah, yes.

480
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,420
Ask me questions.

481
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,880
Are you objecting to making the real
estate bill into the party platform?

482
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,634
I, as the leader of
the Indifferent-to-BH

483
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:40,580
faction, am telling you
in no uncertain terms.

484
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,680
This bill, absolutely

485
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,160
NEVER! I can't put my
seal of approval to it.

486
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,280
Everyone who needs Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's press materials, take one from here.

487
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,100
Yes, take all of these and distribute
them to those who are not here.

488
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,380
Take many! Yes, the
person over there!

489
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,560
Will the real estate bill
become the party platform?

490
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,120
It seems as though Assemblyman
Jin is objecting.

491
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,200
Please one word, Assemblyman!

492
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,790
Never!

493
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:20,450
It sounded like Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil
was objecting. How did the meeting go?

494
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:30,010
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
by The Assembly Team @ Viki</i>

495
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,380
Never, never!

496
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,120
You've done well holding it in
all this time, Assemblyman.

497
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,480
Now, we are just running
with it, right?

498
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,540
Yes, you'd better bring
nerves of steel.

499
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,100
Of course I should.

500
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,820
Jin Sang Pil has caused proper trouble.
The Indifferent-to-BH faction?

501
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,460
Really amazing.

502
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,280
Just say what your business is.

503
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,220
You know that in my party there was a
clash over the real estate policy.

504
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,760
Thanks to Jin Sang Pil, I think the
house will soon come to order.

505
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,020
If you present the bill, then we,
as one party, will object to it.

506
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,280
I mean when even a ruling
party member objects to it,

507
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,940
how can a wise political
party like us agree to it?

508
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,280
Please tell him that the Socialist Party
has already decided to oppose it.

509
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,900
Assemblywoman Cheon says the Socialist
Party is dead set against it.

510
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,540
Have I thumbed my nose too much?

511
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,880
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil is
fighting alone against 150 people.

512
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,380
We need to keep watching.
Whether he will go till the end

513
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,240
or he will surrender.

514
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,640
You can't do this,
Assemblyman Jin.

515
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,840
Assemblyman Jin, you're doing something
that will cause you a big problem.

516
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,740
No matter what you say, I won't
waiver in my conviction.

517
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,600
Do you think we here don't have any
conviction to toe the party line?

518
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,921
What will become of the
nation if all 300 members

519
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,220
of the Assembly act according
to their own whims?

520
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,460
Right, what Assemblywoman
Hong says is the truth.

521
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,140
A unified party position is
absolutely not an evil thing.

522
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,680
And politics should
be predictable

523
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,400
and also have some
efficiency to it.

524
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,240
Party politics is a necessity.

525
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,279
It has many positive functions as well.
However, in

526
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,600
order for a party platform
to possess legitimacy,

527
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,714
it must be the product
of fierce discussions

528
00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:30,380
and negotiations
among the members.

529
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,040
Like this time around, the top-down demand
by the party leadership to follow it

530
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,160
is an act that violates the
national assemblyman's independence

531
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,920
and autonomy guaranteed
by the Constitution.

532
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,680
Wow, simply so much better than some
spokesperson of the Gookmin Party.

533
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,780
Be quiet! The assemblymen
are talking right now!

534
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,040
So impertinent for an aide...

535
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,360
Just be still, stay still, okay?

536
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,706
Look here, this person is
an aide in name only. But

537
00:32:56,718 --> 00:33:00,140
we are on rank-insignia-ignoring
(EQUAL) terms, okay?

538
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:05,260
- What?<br>- If you don't want to
listen to her, just leave.

539
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,580
Assemblyman Jin, you are such a wimp,
using your aide as a shield...

540
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,918
You luckily avoided it
when you objected to

541
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,280
the supplementary budget
bill the last time.

542
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,078
But if you stand up against
the party platform

543
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,020
again this time, you will
be severely sanctioned.

544
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,240
I think there is some
sort of an error here.

545
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,229
Our Assemblyman is not standing
up against a party platform,

546
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:28,700
but is opposed to making
it into a party platform.

547
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,500
Of course.

548
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,624
It does not fall into
the sanctionable cause

549
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,440
category and even if
you sanction him,

550
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,360
he will promptly commence legal proceedings
including a suit to nullify such sanctions.

551
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,920
What?

552
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,040
You heard her, right? This is our
Indifferent-to-BH faction's position.

553
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,740
He didn't buy it one bit!

554
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,204
This Jin Sang Pil person
seemed like a dead mouse,

555
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,400
but in fact he was just
waiting for a chance.

556
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,080
It was my fault. All my attention
was on the Anti-BH faction

557
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,660
and we fell into Jin
Sang Pil's trap.

558
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,243
He's acting up like that
because we have only

559
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:12,680
two more seats than the
opposition parties.

560
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,480
Why don't we accept one person from the
independent assemblymen and kick him out?

561
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,831
I am just breathless with
the wish, but weren't

562
00:34:19,843 --> 00:34:21,960
the majority of the
independent assemblymen

563
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,400
kicked out from their respective parties
for causing all sorts of scandals?

564
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,580
And the few who are okay are
just balancing our party

565
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,180
against the Korean
Democratic Party.

566
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,920
This is really a big problem.

567
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,283
If it does not become a party
platform at this rate,

568
00:34:35,295 --> 00:34:37,760
there will be fire and brimstone
from the Blue House...

569
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,740
Secretary General, what do you
think about using broadcasting?

570
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,640
Broadcasting?

571
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,000
Yes, In Kyung.

572
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,580
Your old man... Can he
appear on the debate show?

573
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,607
Why? When was it when
you talked about

574
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:56,920
zero-level recognition
and dislikable image?

575
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:02,260
It's an item the higher-ups decided on.
That real estate policy thing.

576
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,700
Will he come or not?

577
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,380
An item from the higher-ups?

578
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,640
Hello. I am Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi.

579
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,380
The real estate market
must do its part to

580
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,360
give the economy momentum.
Momentum...momentum...mo-men-tum...

581
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,920
I think it is a tactic to make you into
a tongue-tied dummy before the people.

582
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,056
They will try to make you
feel small and then pursue

583
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:29,800
making the policy into a
party platform again.

584
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,140
But do you think I can do well?

585
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,480
If you want to appear, we will do
our best to prepare you for it.

586
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,320
But you don't need
to overtax yourself.

587
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,680
Because the one in the corner right now is
not us, but Secretary General Baek's side.

588
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,400
Let's just try it,
what the hell.

589
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,102
When we finally got to hit
the road, we can't hit

590
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:58,760
the brakes merely because
of this sort of thing.

591
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,840
Let's just drive
on and get ahead.

592
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,020
Yes, okay.

593
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:12,520
Aigo, loosen up a bit. Are you protesting
right now? Relax your facial muscles.

594
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,800
Straighten up your
shoulders like this too.

595
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,660
- Cool.<br>- Da Jeong, his
face is too shiny.

596
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,560
Aigo, I don't need
things like this...

597
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,360
The most important
thing in a debate is

598
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,820
planting an impression
of honesty.

599
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,030
If your opponent asks you
an unexpected question, you

600
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:33,100
must not gloss over it or
pretend false knowledge,

601
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,560
but reinterpret it from
your point of view

602
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,660
and answer it with your own
confident logic, okay?

603
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,720
Confidence...

604
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,240
- Dong Cheol!<br>- Yes.

605
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,500
They are sure to
ask this question.

606
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,520
Here, under LTV and DTI, write
the meanings in Korean.

607
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,140
Yes.

608
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,220
Hey, Kim Gyu Hwan!<br>- Yes.

609
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,300
- You know the real estate market value
data from the Ministry of Land?<br>- Yes.

610
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,720
- Prepare that quickly.<br>-
Okay, I will.

611
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,340
As you, Assemblywoman
Hong, said that...

612
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,740
I'm not opposed to the intent
behind it, but... okay?

613
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,500
If the economy can be revived...

614
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,391
Assemblyman Jin, you look
far better from the side

615
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,120
of your hair parting, so
from the left side...

616
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,780
No, Assemblyman.

617
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,520
From the right side.

618
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,740
- Then, the economy, this thing...<br>-
Not that, but your shoulders

619
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,380
turn them slightly left and tuck in
your chin and stare into the camera...

620
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
Yes, that's right.

621
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,220
Then, the economy... This
is weird, it's awkward.

622
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,220
All those poses are no go.

623
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,060
Yes, then...

624
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,040
That is, then... Refrain
from using them.

625
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,280
If you... look at this data...

626
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,820
Don't use saliva to turn pages.

627
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,080
- So I'm saying...<br>- Don't
use these expressions.

628
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,100
It won't do. "That..."
Refrain from saying that.

629
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,140
Now, let's go again
from the beginning.

630
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,460
Thank you.

631
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,500
Today, just pat it down it a bit.
The other time, it was too oily.

632
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,240
Yes.

633
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,180
I didn't think you'd come, but
you are here, Assemblyman Jin.

634
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,880
But isn't an assemblyman someone
who goes anywhere he is called?

635
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,980
I consider this your
fault, Choi In Kyung.

636
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,400
Why so?

637
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,940
Because being on air is
a really scary thing.

638
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,590
Not just one or two
assemblymen, who got on air to

639
00:38:35,602 --> 00:38:38,160
get more recognition, were
embarrassed or ruined.

640
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,720
But if you do well, you
win a jackpot, right?

641
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,880
Aish, I'm going crazy, really.

642
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,300
Thank you.

643
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,100
Please stand by, we are
about to go on air.

644
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,600
Aish, did this kid go to take a
dump and not find the toilet paper?

645
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,320
Why is he taking so long?

646
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,680
<i>One-to-One Debate</i>

647
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,180
Gyu Hwan, what is DTI, DTI, huh?

648
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,620
Yes, it's the
debt-to-income ratio.

649
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,400
Oh, right, right. It's here.

650
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,118
It means the percentage of
a borrower's annual income

651
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:32,860
that goes toward making
residential mortgage payments.

652
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,100
Oh, okay. Then
it's not this LTV.

653
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,780
That's the maximum you can borrow
when the house is used as collateral.

654
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,960
- Right? <br> - Yes.

655
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,280
And what is it that Aide Choi
said you absolutely must know?

656
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,792
That... what is the reason why
owners and landlords prefer monthly

657
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:50,140
rent more than the key money
deposit system for leasing homes?

658
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,280
Monthly rent more
than key money?

659
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,060
Prime rate... because of low prime
rates or something like that.

660
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,720
Yes, that's right.

661
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,240
What exactly is the prime rate?
Is it interest?

662
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,130
I think so?

663
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,150
Jeez. Find it already!

664
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,870
If I'm wrong on this,
I'll never live it down!

665
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,480
- Where is it? <br> -You're
making fools of yourselves.

666
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,570
Rather than interest, it's
about the interest rates.

667
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,030
Aide Choi, when I'm screwing up,

668
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,620
after you write it big
on something like a

669
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:22,420
sketchpad, show it to me.
Otherwise I'm a goner.

670
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,367
Assemblyman, although you
said you'd never get

671
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:27,960
scared, are you running
scared right now?

672
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,900
No, I'm not scared but

673
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,580
it's a live broadcast...
a bit... yes.

674
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,850
Give me the notes.

675
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,640
Why?

676
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,340
W-What... What are
you doing right now?

677
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,370
You're a wimp because you are going head
to head against Hong Chan Mi with this.

678
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,991
Forget this now,
Assemblyman, and fight with

679
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:58,460
what you have heard,
seen and felt so far.

680
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:04,090
Climb into the
four-sided ring now.

681
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:08,980
You can never beat the opponent,
relying on something else.

682
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,460
You can only count on yourself.

683
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,470
But, even so, if you
ripped everything up...

684
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,800
Now, ten seconds to go.

685
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,960
Ten seconds.

686
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,090
Now, then. We hope for a good
debate between the two Assemblymen.

687
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,610
Oh, yes.

688
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,330
You look very tense.

689
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,620
Not at all.

690
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,230
Cue.

691
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,080
<i>Good evening, Viewers. I'm
One-to-One Debate's Hong Seung Beom.</i>

692
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,279
<i>We have brought in today
two assemblymen involved</i>

693
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:54,060
<i>in the current Gookmin
Party controversy</i>

694
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,420
<i>over whether a bill to facilitate
real estate transactions</i>

695
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,510
<i>should be a part of
the party's platform.</i>

696
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,340
<i>First the Gookmin
Party's spokesperson</i>

697
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,410
<i>Hong Chan Mi is joining us.</i>

698
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,670
<i>Hello, I am Assemblywoman
Hong Chan Mi.</i>

699
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,016
<i>Who is the opposition
on the issue within the</i>

700
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,130
<i>party? Assemblyman Jin
Sang Pil joins us.</i>

701
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,210
<i>Ah, yes, hel—</i>

702
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,020
Jin Sang Pil .. he
hit a wrong note.

703
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,250
<i>Hello, I am Assemblyman
Jin Sang Pil.</i>

704
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,710
<i>Then, we will reveal</i>

705
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,190
<i>the projected winner of
today's debate on the issue</i>

706
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:32,000
<i>as predicted by one hundred
randomly selected viewers.</i>

707
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
<i>JIN SANG PIL: 6
<br> HONG CHAN MI: 94</i>

708
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,590
<i>Look at that!</i>

709
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:56,800
Oh, this... the result
is a bit surprising.

710
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,960
For One-To-One Debate

711
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,630
<i>the size of this disparity
is an all-time record.</i>

712
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,730
<i>The more we debate, the
less I understand.</i>

713
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,628
The bill is to restore
vitality to the real estate

714
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,250
market, especially for
residential housing,

715
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,420
by streamlining
excessive control,

716
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,380
and I can't fathom any understandable
reason to be opposed to the bill.

717
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,300
Yes, that is, this... the
intent is very good, right?

718
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:30,880
But the gist is, that is, in the
end that the National Assembly

719
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,750
should unregulate re-development, taxes and
things like that and the government...

720
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,960
what... what thingamajig? That LTV
and DDT should be increased...

721
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,000
But, why are your
bringing up DDT here?

722
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,920
Are you thinking of spraying
pesticide on real estate?

723
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,770
Yes, I ah... DTI...

724
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,170
So now...

725
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,722
Do you really think that the
measures repealing reporting duties

726
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,250
for residential transactions and
easing up housing subscription

727
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,715
eligibility requirements as
well as sales of housing

728
00:44:00,727 --> 00:44:03,200
purchase options will trigger
real estate speculation?

729
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,050
Yes, of course, they will. You're
proposing to unregulate everything.

730
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,962
If we control the real estate-related
taxes including the purchase,

731
00:44:07,974 --> 00:44:09,700
recording and transfer taxes
with an equalization rates chart

732
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,770
and curb the demand

733
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,630
I think we can prevent
overheating of the market.

734
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,560
Yes, an equalization chart?

735
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,980
Yes, so, according
to my research,

736
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,970
this... equalization chart
must be controlled,

737
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,430
but how much should it be
controlled, that is...

738
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,420
Why don't you own up?

739
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,420
About what?

740
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,300
That you don't know the contents
of this bill very well.

741
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,170
What do you mean not know well?

742
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:42,830
Why wouldn't I know it well? It
is because you keep butting in

743
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,698
when I'm talking and
keep blabbing with

744
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,800
difficult terminology,
that is why I keep...

745
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,380
Emcee, check Assembly
Jin's words.

746
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,335
Um, Assemblyman, I would
appreciate it if you refrain

747
00:44:55,347 --> 00:44:58,800
from using crude words
during the broadcasting.

748
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:02,670
Oh, yes, did I? I am sorry.

749
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,240
That is an item that
we went over together.

750
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,780
It's because he keeps
answering her questions.

751
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,420
He has to assail her
with questions.

752
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:16,780
At any rate, how much Assemblyman Jin
knows about this issue to oppose it...

753
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,000
I believe the viewers are making
a good assessment of that.

754
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,050
After all is said and done, do you
think a debate was too much for him?

755
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,670
No, it's not time to
get discouraged yet.

756
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,297
Assemblyman, if you have
no further response,

757
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,920
maybe we can move on
to the next topic...

758
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,030
Yes, about this, I

759
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,900
did not come as well prepared
as Assemblywoman Hong.

760
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,960
Because I don't know very well.

761
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,620
In fact, I didn't study enough.

762
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,270
I was studying
even just now, but

763
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:12,390
I am sorry about that. Even the notes
I had, my aide tore them apart.

764
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,550
Yes, I do not know very well. But about
this one thing, I am positively sure.

765
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,750
What is it?

766
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:24,380
Lately, there is this
youngster that I am fond of.

767
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,700
That fellow receives a monthly
salary of barely $1000

768
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,250
and used to pay $400 for a
hole of a room in a goshiwon.

769
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,360
Let's say this bill gets passed

770
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,570
and revitalizes the
real estate market.

771
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:44,730
To that fellow, there
is nothing beneficial.

772
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,710
And there is no hope for him.

773
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,990
Nowdays, these friends
are called the Chilpo

774
00:46:51,002 --> 00:46:53,130
generation for the seven
objects they give up.

775
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:58,000
Courtship, marriage, childbirth,
personal relationships,

776
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,960
home ownership, and
along with that

777
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,547
dreams and even hope
have all been given up.

778
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:05,300
<br> (<I>CHIL=7; PO = BEGINNING
SYLLABLE FOR GIVE UP</I>)

779
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,900
Assemblyman Jin, this is outside
the scope of this debate.

780
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,380
This occasion is to debate the ways to
revitalize real estate transactions...

781
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,840
Why, why is this outside
the scope of the debate?

782
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,460
I am speaking up about the reason
why I am opposing this bill.

783
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:26,380
As for me, I never told you
not to introduce this bill.

784
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,070
If necessary, go ahead and introduce
it, even right this moment. But,

785
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,870
just don't say that I have to, I
must be forced to sign off on it.

786
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,570
I hate that idea
to death, really.

787
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,100
I won't do it, even
if you kill me.

788
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,820
The bill that I, I really...
really want to support is

789
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,059
not a bill that facilitates
purchases and sales of

790
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:51,190
houses costing hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

791
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:54,810
As for me, those youths with their
whole lives to live ahead of them,

792
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:58,750
when they work themselves
to the bone and later

793
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,810
when they grow old and somehow own even
a small house, at least that one thing!

794
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:05,920
That they can have a dream
of buying it at least,

795
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,050
that they can have that hope...

796
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:13,610
I want to put my seal of
approval to that kind of bill!

797
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:22,150
Right now, you are uttering
slyly loaded words.

798
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,196
But the intent behind
facilitating real estate

799
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,960
transactions is to
revive the market and

800
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,500
in the end to
revive the economy.

801
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,419
The economy has to be
revived for the younger

802
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:32,530
generation to grow dreams
and hope, isn't that so?

803
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:36,130
Right, yes, the economy has
to be revived, of course.

804
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,151
Yes, the economy has to be revived.
I have heard those words

805
00:48:38,163 --> 00:48:40,030
since I was a wee little lad
until they stuck in my ear!

806
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,180
The words I've heard are
revive the economy.

807
00:48:42,192 --> 00:48:44,210
But when will it come
alive, the economy!?

808
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,170
Everyday you say let's revive it, but
when will it come back to life!?

809
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:53,290
But still, still
we must revive it.

810
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:56,800
Yes, we must try to revive it.

811
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,300
But that is work cut out
for Assemblywoman Hong

812
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,250
here, who is all that.

813
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,500
- What?<br>- As for me,

814
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,689
people who, like me,
cannot even dream of

815
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:11,060
borrowing money because
of their poor credit,

816
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,750
okay?

817
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,700
Because the key moneys are
rising more than the pay raise,

818
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:21,600
people who keep looking for
housing in the outskirts.

819
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,770
The only possession
is just their house,

820
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,800
so people who have no thought
whatever of selling and buying it!

821
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,760
I will just...

822
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:39,370
yes, I will just
help those people.

823
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,500
Satisfied?

824
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,670
Yes, Assemblywoman,
are you satisfied?

825
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,000
Let's move on to...
the next topic.

826
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,460
Okay.

827
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,170
The next topic is related
to redevelopment.

828
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,180
Apartment complexes or villas
of 20-30 years of age...

829
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,484
Now then, we will look
into the final evaluation

830
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:12,880
of the viewers who have
tuned into today's debate.

831
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,020
Please show us the result.

832
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,710
<i>JIN SANG PIL 53 :
Hong Chan Mi 47</i>

833
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,880
Yes. The results are out.

834
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:42,020
By 53 to 47... Manse!

835
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:57,010
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil has
come from behind to win it.

836
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,066
There was the biggest pre-
and post- change of votes

837
00:51:00,078 --> 00:51:01,690
in the history of the
One-to-One Debate show.

838
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:07,490
But I think maybe Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil
moved the hearts of the viewers a bit more.

839
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:11,160
Thank you very much for taking time out of
your busy schedules, Assemblywoman and man.

840
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,060
Hong Seung Beon's One-to-One
Debate will say good-night here.

841
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,860
Thank you, Viewers.

842
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,453
No, but if that... that
happens, isn't the party

843
00:51:20,465 --> 00:51:23,430
platform thing completely
out of the question now?

844
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,870
Yes, Assemblyman Park.

845
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:33,000
Let's quit putting it
on the party platform.

846
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,790
<i>That's as much help as
you're getting from us so</i>

847
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,750
cancel the party audit
of the chapters.

848
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,770
If you go ahead with it,

849
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,830
then there will be a real war.

850
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,470
You've worked hard.

851
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:03,630
At any rate... yes, good job.

852
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:15,310
Good job, Assemblywoman.

853
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,450
Sang Pil!

854
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:28,630
Aigoo, why are you doing this
again, making my flesh crawl...

855
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:30,840
Let me go please.

856
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,970
You did well, well!

857
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,250
All right, all right.

858
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,890
How was I? Was I okay?

859
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:45,100
Of course, WHOSE assemblyman
are you, after all?

860
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,370
But, how can you talk about me all
you want, without my permission?

861
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:57,750
Hey, are you the only kid
living in a goshiwon hole?

862
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:03,940
Then, don't go around saying that
person is me. I'll be embarrassed.

863
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,660
What, punk?

864
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,690
Let's go. I'm famished.

865
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,410
I will buy you something yummy.

866
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,200
- Really?<br>- Yes.

867
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,570
- Huh? So unlike
you...<br>- Let's go eat.

868
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,800
Really? I got it.

869
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:25,700
You'd better leave for today.

870
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,050
The VIP does not
want to see you.

871
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,800
Please relay to him that I
will contact him again.

872
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,650
Secretary General.

873
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,280
Do better.

874
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,106
How can someone like
you, Secretary General

875
00:53:49,118 --> 00:53:52,150
Baek, not handle Jin Sang
Pil, that one person?

876
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,230
Chief Secretary...

877
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:07,000
I think you've become a bit flippant,
assisting the Elder from his side.

878
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,100
In the future, please refrain from
speaking to me in an imperative tone.

879
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,590
Secretary General.

880
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:25,910
There is only one person in Korea
who can speak to me that way.

881
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,100
The Elder is the only one.

882
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:32,120
Do you understand?

883
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,080
Please pass this on to the Elder.

884
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,820
Without fail I'm going to get Jin Sang Pil.

885
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,830
Teach you how to draw up a bill?

886
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,909
- Yes.<br>- What winds of
change blew on you?

887
00:55:17,921 --> 00:55:19,870
That's not in your character.

888
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,870
I am thinking of changing my character.

889
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:25,526
Drawing up a bill is just
a matter of technicality,

890
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:28,000
the true issue is the item.
What is it? Tell me.

891
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,350
First, teach me the steps.

892
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:34,620
When it's completed, I
will show it to you then.

893
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,800
Why are you looking like that?

894
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,120
Because I'm a bit proud of you.

895
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:47,320
Aigoo, our Kim Gyu Hwan
has all grown up and...

896
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:54,600
Don't do this. I'm not a kid, okay?

897
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,993
I'll gather up all the information
you need. So just escort

898
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:59,090
the Assemblyman to make a
round in the constituency.

899
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,450
Okay.

900
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:07,260
But, really, can't you
not treat me like a kid?

901
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:11,360
But a thirty-year-old is a
kid, seriously, really!

902
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:20,130
Then we will introduce
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

903
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,100
<i>Organization of a Gathering of Gyeongje
Citizens Who Support Jin Sang Pil</i>

904
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:41,400
Aigoo, really, I...
Because of you, I really

905
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,440
feel energized.

906
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:49,780
Aigoo, really, a gathering of Gyeongje
citizens who support Jin Sang Pil...

907
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,900
Who came up with the name?
You did a good job.

908
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,200
Yes, I really will work very hard.

909
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,360
I will really not let you down

910
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,330
and do my best in the future.

911
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:06,460
Even though there are not many of us now,

912
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,030
one will grow into ten and ten will
grow into a hundred, isn't that so?

913
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,340
Cheer up, Assemblyman!

914
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,230
Yes, cheer up!

915
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:25,800
Jin Sang Pil! Jin Sang Pil!

916
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,810
Hey there, excuse me for asking.

917
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,840
Yes. Go ahead.

918
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:40,590
You're Bae Gyu Hwan, right?

919
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,610
- Who are you? <br> - Don't you know me?

920
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:49,320
Room 3, 6th grade, Kim Jeong Im.
You and I were even partners.

921
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,970
I wasn't sure because
of the glasses, but...

922
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,400
You are mistaken.

923
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,200
But, isn't it Bae Gyu Hwan?

924
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,390
Bae Gyu Hwan?

925
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,510
No, I'm not.

926
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,450
I'm right. Isn't it?

927
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,730
Yes, the Jin Ji Mo (SUPPORT JIN GATHERING)
meeting went off without a hitch.

928
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,480
I had such a tough time
holding back the tears.

929
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,900
Don't forget that feeling from today.

930
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:27,690
- I'm going to grow the Jin Ji Mo
on a national scale, okay?<br>- Okay.

931
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:29,953
If Secretary Kim is next
to you, tell him to

932
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:32,290
hurry and send the pictures
to Secretary Song.

933
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:34,650
Huh? Secretary Kim went to Busan.

934
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:35,750
Why to Busan?

935
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:41,190
Is he someone who would answer if
you asked him? Brushing you off...

936
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:44,440
Hang up because I have to eat.

937
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,460
- But Sang Pil,<br>- Huh?

938
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,900
You are walking down a street

939
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,986
and say hi to someone
you recognized as Kim

940
00:58:55,998 --> 00:58:58,240
Cheol Soo, but if that
guy is not Kim Cheol Soo

941
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,850
but Bae Cheol Soo, isn't
that a bit suspicious?

942
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,760
What are you talking about?

943
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,060
I mean, earlier at the Jin Ji Mo,
some woman asked Secretary Kim

944
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:11,980
whether he wasn't Bae Gyu Hwan and
Secretary Kim said no and left.

945
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,950
But Secretary Kim is Kim Gyu Hwan.

946
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,370
- Is that right?<br>- Isn't that strange?

947
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:18,740
Did he change his family name in midstream?

948
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,500
You're curious about so many things.

949
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,860
After eating,

950
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,220
a bit later stay in a sauna or something.

951
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,400
- Why, you have business
to attend to?<br>- Yes.

952
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:43,960
You took off a day to go somewhere a while
ago and why are you in Busan today?

953
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,080
Is there a problem with your family?

954
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,090
No, not a problem, but...

955
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,800
I'm visiting my father for a while
because today is his birthday.

956
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,910
Is that so? Okay. Be a very
loving son before coming back.

957
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,720
Yes. See you tomorrow.

958
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,840

961
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,930
We must confirm the newly
appointed prime minister.

962
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,180
The approval rates for
the party will plummet.

963
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,140
At this rate, how can we win
in the next year's election?

964
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,270
I will try to catch Jin Sang Pil.

965
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,820
I am sorry.

966
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:21,180
I never knew I would some day witness a
filibuster that I had only heard about.

967
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:26,190
By now, Baek Do Hyeon's butt hole must
feel like it's sitting on a burning fuse.

968
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,680
This is tyranny of the minority
masquerading as a lawful act.

969
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,360
Is this really politics for
the sake of the people?

970
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,360
You should have been prepared at least
for that. How are you doing your jobs?
