3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,130
Oh!

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,700
<i>Episode 10</i>

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,120
What brings you here so early
in the morning, Choi In Kyung?

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,930
Because I heard that your
office is looking for an aide,

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,230
I came to apply.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,590
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,230
I do lack many things but

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,940
if you look at the resume and my work
experience, you might want to hire me.

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:51,150
<i>Resume</i>

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,550
<i>SPECIAL NOTE: 2015 Candidate for
Gyeongjae District Assembly.</i>

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,350
I sent you away, so why
are you doing this?

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,870
You have to wear the
badge next time.

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,520
If you come to me, you know
there will be nothing for you.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,220
Are you a dummy, Choi In Kyung?

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,510
Now, I'm going to
try to be a dummy.

18
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,980
Just like you, Assemblyman.

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,720
Sang Pil! Aide Choi's car...

20
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,720
A while back, Secretary
General Baek Do Hyeon

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,120
taught me something.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,950
Even if you lose 99 times,
the one last victory

23
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,630
will decide everything.

24
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,000
Even if you have lost many times thus far,
don't you think you should win next time?

25
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,690
Please take care of me.

26
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,400
Yes.

27
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,480
Let's make sure we win.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,470
Yes, Assemblyman.

29
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,690
Oh, I'm late. Late. Oh, Aide.

30
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,070
What time is it now?

31
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,470
I'm sorry. I had an alumni
meeting last night so I drank...

32
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,790
Oh, my insides.

33
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,430
What did you eat
for side dishes?

34
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,520
Why are you late?

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,500
- I'm an aide. <br> - What?

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,440
Assemblyman Jin Sang
Pil's number two.

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,800
Two.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,330
I admire you.

39
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,120
Please go in.

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,400
I apologize for causing concern.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,820
From now on, I will turn over a new leaf,
so for Assemblyman and this office,

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,030
I'll do my best.

43
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,160
As the saying goes, the ground
becomes sturdier after the rain.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,720
Now, Aide Choi comes back and
joins our team. Therefore,

45
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,860
let's be energized. Fighting!

46
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,720
Fighting!

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,740
The atmosphere feels good.

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,440
I expected an atmosphere
of deep mourning.

49
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,060
Who is this?

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,660
Hello? I am a newly hired
aide for the Assemblyman.

51
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,200
What brings you here?

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,580
I don't even eat with aides,
so why don't you leave?

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,040
I promoted her to the Assembly-level
treatment. So, don't mind her.

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,800
Just tell us why you are here.

55
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,320
I came to hear your answer regarding
your entrance to the election.

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,420
I told you I was going to
wait until today, right?

57
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,280
I THINK I TOLD YOU LAST TIME:
when hell freezes over.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,980
I just can't understand you.
I told you yesterday.

59
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,360
It's a proposal that includes enough
compensation for not running.

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,528
Is a director's-level
position at a large

61
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,860
public company just a
run-of-the-mill position?

62
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,740
I told you that I have no
interest in that kind of thing.

63
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,160
-Just go.<br>-Assemblyman Jin.

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,040
You must be thinking that something
will pop up if you persevere.

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,498
If the vote of no confidence
passes at the Gyeongjae

66
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,560
City Gookmin Party
Members' General Meeting,

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,240
you will lose the nomination
for next year's election.

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,060
Which party is going to be so irrational
as to nominate a censured person?

69
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,420
For Assemblyman, there
will no case of

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,700
being censured.

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,420
-How so?<br>-Beats me.

72
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,800
Showing off...

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,720
I understand. Work hard.

74
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Okay.

75
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,660
Both of them are showing off!

76
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,640
How vulgar!

77
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,620
By the way, Aide Choi. Is there
really a way not to be censured?

78
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,200
It is impossible within
the regular procedure.

79
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,720
The members who are trying to convene the
meeting belong to the Anti-BH Faction.

80
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,500
That means Park Choon Seop allied
with Secretary General Baek.

81
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,280
Once the general meeting is held, there's
a 100% probability that you will be out.

82
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,340
A few minutes ago, you
said I would not be out.

83
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,260
That means you just showed off
when Assemblywoman Hong was here.

84
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,380
There is only one way! We prevent
the meeting from ever being held.

85
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,320
How?

86
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,540
You would have to cause trouble.

87
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,500
Trouble? What kind?

88
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,140
Why do we help Baek Do Hyeon?

89
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,200
We're on the same team,

90
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,300
but why do we always fight?

91
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,560
We sometimes need
to help out too.

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,160
You might be able to trick some
people, but you can't trick me.

93
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,800
Assemblyman Park, why
don't you speak honestly?

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,760
What did you receive
from Baek Do Hyeon?

95
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,180
Nomination for the
next election!

96
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,080
What?

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,920
He said he would give it, so I
accepted without hesitation.

98
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,740
Does an assemblyman exist in Korea who
wouldn't want to accept the nomination?

99
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,660
Assemblyman Park, you are
betraying your hoobaes!

100
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,210
Why have we confronted Baek
Do Hyeon all these times?

101
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,200
Because if we don't want to get
slaughtered at the next nomination,

102
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,160
we have to take him down from the
Secretary General position, don't we?

103
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,612
But now, if you alone,
as the annointed one,

104
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:09,760
receive a bulletproof
vest and wear it,

105
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,820
does that make sense to you?

106
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,800
You're really... simple.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,160
What?

108
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,480
Do you think this Park Choon Seop only did
it because he lacked a bulletproof vest?

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,420
Then why are you doing this?

110
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm trying to take
down Jin Sang Pil.

111
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,760
Indeed, Baek Do Hyeon made Jin Sang
Pil half-dead by stepping on him.

112
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,060
Why do we have to help him?

113
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,900
Jin Sang Pil has to be
in a desperate position

114
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,480
so that he can cause trouble.

115
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,240
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

116
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,680
Leaving the party.

117
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,400
- Leaving the party? <br> -Yes.

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,320
You want me to leave
the Gookmin Party?

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,760
Lea... Leaving the party?

120
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,060
If Jin Sang Pil leaves the party,
the problem becomes serious.

121
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,320
I mean retaining the
ruling majority.

122
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,720
But, we now have 151 seats.

123
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,740
The opposition have 149 seats...

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,720
One hundred fifty to
one hundred fifty.

125
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,220
The Gookmin Party ruling
majority will be lost.

126
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,220
If you switch your party affiliation,
Secretary General will have to take the

127
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,840
responsibility for losing the
Gookmin Party's ruling majority.

128
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,960
Oh, that will be the case.

129
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,980
He will really have to abdicate
his Secretary General's position.

130
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,740
Not only that but because he will
be shunned by the Blue House,

131
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,540
he will have to relinquish his leadership
position in the Pro-BH faction as well.

132
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,000
In other words, he'll
become a paper tiger.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,596
But are you saying
that Secretary General

134
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:52,340
Baek is not aware of
those things right now?

135
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,120
It would make no sense if the top person
in the Gookmin Party didn't know that.

136
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,800
The price of your not running
in the next election:

137
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,580
that he will get you a director's-level
position at a large public company

138
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,740
is the very reason for that.

139
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,376
Now, I know. He was saying
that I should take the

140
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,420
carrot that was thrown
to me and be on my way.

141
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,409
Secretary General Baek
might have seemed calm on

142
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:15,360
the outside but inside,
he must be very nervous.

143
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,560
You say that Assemblyman
Jin absolutely refused?

144
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes.

145
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,440
But do you have a concern?

146
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,900
You don't look very well.

147
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,820
-Even so, I can't leave
the party.<br>-What?

148
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,260
The citizens don't like that.

149
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,820
Did I become who I am
because I was so great?

150
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,260
I was elected at Gyeongjae City because
of the strength of the Gookmin Party.

151
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,280
What will happen if I leave the party?
They will call me a traitor.

152
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,080
Assemblyman, stop getting so worried
and just do what I tell you to do!

153
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,240
Aide Choi, how could
you say it that way?

154
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,520
I am regretting
hiring you again.

155
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,610
In Kyung went back to
Assemblyman Jin...

156
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,980
Yes.

157
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,920
What was she thinking?

158
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,748
I want you to assure me,
as a person who works hard

159
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,860
and doesn't want to get
disappointed, of one thing.

160
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,620
Choi In Kyung is out in
the cold now, isn't she?

161
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,700
She is not just out in the cold,
she is now in Antarctica.

162
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,100
To what do I owe the honor of
this call, Assemblyman Jin?

163
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,160
<i>Could I see you briefly?</i>

164
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,960
Would you cancel the party
members' general meeting?

165
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,460
I will refuse.

166
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,016
Before coming here, I
left something with

167
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,780
Aide Choi In Kyung. Are
you curious about it?

168
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,140
I am not sure.

169
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,660
Withdrawal from the party.

170
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,080
-You want to leave
the party.<br>-Yes.

171
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,902
If I get a vote of no
confidence, I will immediately

00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:06,480
hold a press conference
to declare my defection.

173
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,440
Well, let me hear the reason why
you want to switch parties.

174
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,800
Because you manipulated
the party members so that

175
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,730
you effectively removed
me from the party.

176
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,430
I was wronged.

177
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,540
Just over that, you think the
citizens will sympathize with you?

178
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,784
All you are going to do is
shorten your political life,

179
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,890
which hasn't got much life
left in it to begin with.

180
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,010
Whether I die on the
fifth or sixth of April,

181
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,497
because I'm going to die
anyway, I am thinking about

182
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,630
dying together with you,
holding you tightly.

183
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,880
If I switch party affiliation, I know
that the party's majority will end.

184
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,390
I also know that if that happens,
it'll be the end of you as well.

185
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,860
You're scared, right?

186
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,310
That kind of empty
threat won't work on me.

187
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,590
Just announce that you
won't run as a candidate.

188
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,820
I don't want to.

189
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,920
The Gyeongjae local party meeting
will proceed as scheduled.

190
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,100
Then, I'll defect.

191
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,940
What happened?

192
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,290
Secretary General Baek did shove back a
bit but he also seemed a bit afraid.

193
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,450
I really don't know.

194
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,990
Is that so?

195
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,600
Now, you and Secretary
General Baek have

196
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,010
started the game of Chicken.

197
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,860
What -- a game?

198
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,120
Chicken?

199
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,640
It means the one who is afraid.

200
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,110
Once upon a time, young Americans
used their cars to play this game.

201
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,140
In it, they face each other
and drive towards each other.

202
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,700
The one who succumbs to his fear and
turns the steering wheel loses.

203
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,020
If both of them never turn their
steering wheels, what will happen?

204
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,400
They'll crash and both will die.

205
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,930
You have to make Secretary General
Baek turn that steering wheel first.

206
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,139
But will the Secretary
General Baek who is

207
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:13,290
so full of hot air turn
that steering wheel?

208
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,431
It will be him. As the
person who has the

209
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,750
most to lose,<br> he will
be the most afraid.

210
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,130
Yeah, like the rich person who's
looking out for his well being.

211
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,101
As the general meeting day
gets closer, the person who

212
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,880
gets more anxious will be
Secretary General Baek.

213
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,900
Until then, you go
around the district and

214
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,570
you have to make an advantageous
situation for yourself.

215
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,910

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,970
You guys!

344
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,610
If one keeps going around,
he'll run into old friends.

345
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,000
Ah seriously. I haven't seen you
in a long time. How are you?

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,930
Yes, we're living stuck in a rut, Mr.
Assemblyman.

347
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,350
If you haven't eaten yet, why don't
we have a meal together, huh?

348
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,310
I'm sorry but I have a
rather weak stomach.

349
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,390
My stomach doesn't feel very
well, either, Assemblyman.

350
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,570
- Mine isn't good,
either.<br>- Neither is mine.

351
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,630
Don't be like that.

352
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,940
Assemblyman Jin is having
a hard time these days.

353
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,890
Turning assemblyman
after being a welder...

354
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,420
I can understand how you
may want to enjoy it more.

355
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,855
But if you have something
called a conscience,

356
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,690
it's about time you
clambered down.

357
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,150
Section Head Kim.

358
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,610
Hyung Dal Soo is howling from
the nether world, you scumbag!

359
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,500
Why are you bringing
up Hyung Dal Soo, huh?

360
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,800
Why talk about
Hyung Dal Soo now?

361
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Assemblyman Jin, there are ears listening.
Turn down your volume.

362
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,220
When Hyung Dal Soo was
beaten up and hospitalized,

363
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,040
you used that timing to
settle with the company

364
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,380
and pocketed that party nomination. Is
that something a human should do, huh?

365
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,690
So I'm paying the price
right now, aren't I?

366
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,160
I am doing this right now so
that Hyung Dal Soo won't wail.

367
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,130
Don't delude yourself. You
quitting will be more helpful.

368
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,390
Do you know, you piece of crap?

369
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,940
Do you guys know?

370
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,500
Do you really know what
Hyung Dal Soo wants?

371
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,470
Do you guys even know?

372
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,950
Hey, I don't think this will do.
You guys go. Just go.

373
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,180
Let's go -- let's
go -- let's go.

374
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,580
Go! Go away.

375
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,780
Leaving a bad taste in my mouth...
Let's go.

376
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,740
Hey.

377
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,620
Can I ask you a question?

378
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,290
What is it?

379
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,010
That...

380
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,270
It's about Hyung Dal Soo.

381
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,110
What?

382
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,250
What he really wants...

383
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,160
do you know, Assemblyman?

384
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,910
Why do you want to know?

385
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:44,880
I'm your secretary, Assemblyman.

386
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,470
- Is there a reason you can't tell me?<br>
- What, kid?

387
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,490
Please tell me.

388
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,170
He said to take care of the...

389
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,420
earth.

390
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,790
The Eagle 5 Brothers (MANHWA
CHARACTERS) have left the earth.

391
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,710
Forever.

392
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,150
Satisfied?

393
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,710
Hyung Seung Gi, let's go.

394
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,760
We have to go. Get up.

395
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,310
Hurry up and get up.

396
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,790
Dang, let's go together.

397
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,560
I'm sick of this chicken.

398
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,970
Aide Choi, why do you

399
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,880
only order chicken these days?

400
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,250
Aide Choi.

401
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,020
- Aide Seo. <br> - Yeah.

402
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,500
Take this and go out with
Secretary Sim to get a drink.

403
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,310
Alcohol?

404
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,280
Are you saying that out
of your sincere heart?

405
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,420
Yes. It doesn't matter
how many rounds you go.

406
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,610
Assemblyman Jin is no joke.

407
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,540
He won't be able to win
against Baek Do Hyeon.

408
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,610
Soon, he will waive a
white flag and surrender.

409
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,890
I really don't think
this is right!

410
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,590
Aide-nim, aish, shouldn't he
really refrain from this?

411
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,790
It's not even a sure thing yet,
so why are you doing this?

412
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,260
What if someone hears us?

413
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,710
Then let them hear it!

414
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,030
What? Defecting?

415
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,690
Muffle your muzzle.

416
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,370
After all, how was he
elected in Gyeongjae City?

417
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,960
There, if you only have the
Gookmin Party name tag...

418
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,150
Even if I run, no, no, no...

419
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,180
Even if our youngest Park Da Jeong
runs, she will get elected there.

420
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,000
And he's leaving the party?

421
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,220
No matter how wet a blanket
he is, if he's a human being,

422
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,090
he shouldn't do that, right?

423
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,690
Let's stop. Let's go.

424
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,560
Aish, why do you keep
saying defect and defect?

425
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,940
Hey, Jin Sang Pil...

426
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,540
No, I mean Sim Dong Cheon,
how can a young guy

427
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:24,830
like you have such low
alcohol tolerance?

428
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,310
Do you think you can
manage defection?

429
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,320
Let's go.

430
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,010
Defection?

431
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,440
Assembly Jin Sang
Pil is doing it?

432
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,980
What are you talking
about, Reporter?

433
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,810
Who's defecting?

434
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,600
Those are all rumors.

435
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,440
Yes, I swear I
will never defect.

436
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,040
Yes. Yes.

437
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,290
Is it a reporter again?

438
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,090
Yes, I wonder where he
heard these things.

439
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,170
It's strange.

440
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,990
Why aren't you eating? Eat.

441
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,020
Eat a lot.

442
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,530
Hey, can't we stop eating
this damned chicken?

443
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,010
Secretary General!

444
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,450
Reporters are investigating the talks
about Jin Sang Pil's defection.

445
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,300
I know.

446
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,060
They're not reporting on it yet,
but it's just a matter of time.

447
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,480
We have to delay it
as much as possible.

448
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,950
Please utilize all the capacity you have
in the Spokesperson's Office and stop it.

449
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,210
Yes.

450
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,260
Even I got a call
from a reporter.

451
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,770
If Jin Sang Pil really defects,
wouldn't that be a big disaster?

452
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,730
That will never happen. Do
not worry, Party Leader.

453
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,850
But there is such a thing as a
one-in-ten-thousand chance.

454
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,920
One little slip, and even
I might be on the hook.

455
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,130
That will never happen.
Didn't I tell you?

456
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,220
Secretary General!

457
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,620
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,060
Yes, Chief Secretary
(FOR THE BLUE HOUSE).

459
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,770
Why on earth is there a buzz of talk about
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil's defection?

460
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,070
That was just a rumor.

461
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,280
I will take good care of it,
so you need not be worried.

462
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,868
Since the regular parliamentary
session is just around

463
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,150
the corner, let's stay
quiet for the time being.

464
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,570
Please cease any and all behavior that
may provoke Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

465
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,867
Chief Secretary! Are you
going to keep interfering

466
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:32,600
with the party matters
in this manner?

467
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,890
Well, this is not my opinion.

468
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,950
It's the VIP's opinion!

469
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:55,460
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
by The Assembly Team @ Viki</i>

470
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,050
Did you stay up all night?

471
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,140
I'm not sleepy.

472
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,790
-You should go in and sleep
more.<br>-I'm done sleeping.

473
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,120
- Aide Choi. <br> - Yes?

474
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,820
For your return to work...

475
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,300
I'm slightly grateful.

476
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,460
Me too.

477
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,510
Yes. <i>I'm Choi In Kyung.</i>

478
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,370
<i>It's me.</i>

479
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,150
Yes.

480
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,060
This time...

481
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,230
I think you have won.

482
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,800
Yes.

483
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,470
What kind of phone call was it?

484
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,690
Hello.

485
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,710
What happened?

486
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,580
What?

487
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,550
Did you really say...

488
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,880
that Secretary General
Baek waved the white flag?

489
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,800
I will relay to you Secretary
General Baek's exact words.

490
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,430
"This time, you have won."

491
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,580
Assemblyman, you have
been through a lot.

492
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,330
What do you mean I suffered?

493
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,910
All you guys have
worked hard too.

494
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,510
- You were really
tough!<br>- Good job!

495
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,690
You hung tough!

496
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,620
Thanks.

497
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,220
Assemblyman, when are
you coming back?

498
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,600
In the afternoon I have a
few places I have to go to,

499
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,430
so I'll go back
right after that.

500
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,490
Today, you should
go home and rest.

501
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,420
Don't worry about us.

502
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,570
Yes, yes. Because you've
all worked hard, go home.

503
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,020
Great job!

504
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,940
Go home!

505
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,620
Wow!

506
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,900
We did Aide Choi's bidding and Secretary
General Baek surrenders to us!

507
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,800
That's right. Aide Choi
is an amazing person.

508
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,770
Assemblyman Jin, are you okay?

509
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,610
What?

510
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,380
- Are you crying?<br>-
Who's crying?

511
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,380
You're crying? He's crying!

512
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,970
Wow, you're shedding
tears of joy.

513
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,740
Calling off the general meeting?

514
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,200
Yes.

515
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,900
From inside and
outside the party,

516
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,344
there are voices of concern
calling an impeachment of

517
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:00,630
the head of a local party
chapter a bit too harsh.

518
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,770
How do you propose
to call it off?

519
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,492
The members who had demanded
the meeting can send

520
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,100
a revocation to the party
administration office.

521
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,000
- Party members are not kids, and
I can't order them around.<br>- What?

522
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,613
Only yesterday, the party even
distributed press materials to convene

523
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:18,100
a general meeting, and we're to
call it off this late in the game?

524
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,900
Because I'll feel ashamed, I
can't do those kind of things.

525
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:32,930
If you act like this, I will not be able
to keep the promise I made a while ago.

526
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,890
Look here, Secretary
General Baek,

527
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:46,100
even until now, I have never
begged anyone for a nomination.

528
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,520
I did it with my own strength, and
I will do that the next time too.

529
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:56,860
As for me, I am different than the
ones that you have dealt with before;

530
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,580
if you are going to be like this, you'll
face unfortunate circumstances for sure.

531
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,430
Will it really happen?

532
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,863
After you don't give the
nomination to me, do

533
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,040
you really think you can
handle the aftermath?

534
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,293
For a person who is
worried sick about a mere

535
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,500
Assemblyman Jin defecting
to another party...

536
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,700
Assemblyman Park!

537
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,120
I think tomorrow's Gyeongjae District
meeting will be very interesting.

538
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,940
If he's faced with a vote of no confidence,
how will Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil act?

539
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,440
These past days, all of you
have been through a lot.

540
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,740
Aide Choi, no matter what others
say about our victory this time...

541
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,750
isn't it because of
our combined work?

542
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,840
Acknowledged.

543
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,000
- Then, give us a reward vacation or
something like that!<br>- No.<br>- Why not?

544
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,971
There you go again! How far off is
the regular parliamentary session?

545
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:24,540
Just make thorough preparations
for the inspection hearings.

546
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,830
- Yes.<br>
- Now, we've only turned one corner.

547
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,280
From this point on,
let's work even harder.

548
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,290
<i>Secretary General Baek.</i>

549
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,710
<i>A problem arose. The
Anti-BH faction acted up.</i>

550
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,840
I thought you were on Secretary
General Baek's side.

551
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,410
I was surprised that you
were on the other side.

552
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,960
So, what is it that you want?

553
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:07,040
I wish for you to cancel the
general meeting tomorrow.

554
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,910
Such a bold person, you are.

555
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,930
Assemblyman Jin will leave the party
after a vote of no confidence.

556
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:20,380
Then, the majority government will be
lost and you, Assemblyman Park, will

557
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,790
not be free from blame, either.

558
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:29,360
I'm already far out of favor with
the Blue House or party leadership.

559
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,100
even if I get pushed out
more, I don't care.

560
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,370
I know you are out to get
Secretary General Baek.

561
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,430
Because of Assemblyman Jin's untenable
situation with the Secretary General,

562
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,713
if you can stop the general
meeting for him, Assemblyman

563
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:49,080
Jin can stop Secretary General
Baek for you in Gyeongjae.

564
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:58,350
I guess you intend to have Assemblyman Jin
re-elected in Gyeongjae City next term.

565
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,760
That's correct.

566
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,230
If you do that, what's there
to gain for yourself?

567
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,420
- What?<br>- Close aides
are, to begin with,

568
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,670
people who survive on
breadcrumbs from their bosses.

569
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,110
I'm asking what is
your breadcrumb?

570
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,800
I haven't thought of that yet.

571
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,650
Because my idea of a close aide
is a bit different from yours.

572
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,590
If that's the case,
my answer is no.

573
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,440
You should leave now.

574
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,730
What is the reason?

575
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,100
I can't trust you.

576
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,590
I seem untrustworthy?

577
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:53,220
I don't believe in people. I
only have faith in their greed.

578
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:57,820
Greed makes predictions
and controls possible.

579
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,240
For people who have no greed, I
don't know where they will end up.

580
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,120
Just like you and the
assemblyman whom you serve.

581
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:15,390
Assemblyman, I beg
of you sincerely.

582
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,524
As an aide, I want to, at
the very least, prevent

583
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:19,510
my assemblyman from having
to leave the party.

584
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,990
Factions aside, as a senior
member of the party,

585
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,550
I wish you would give Assemblyman Jin
a chance to work within the party.

586
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:31,800
The bus has already left.
The last one, at that.

587
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:39,060
<i>Subtitles ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

588
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,780
Eat slowly! You're going
to get indigestion.

589
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,160
-Yes.<br>-Chew your food.

590
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,200
You have to eat it with stew.

591
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,040
-Awesome.<br>-Is it good?

592
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,170
Yes, thank you, Oppa.

593
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:59,300
Eat it well.

594
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,939
Jin Joo Hee, be honest.
You came here because you

595
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,390
got in trouble with your
mom for not studying.

596
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:10,560
Not at all! I came here to
play with Oppa Gyu Hwan.

597
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,440
With me?

598
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,930
You're going to play
with me, right?

599
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,730
Oh. Sure.

600
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,960
-Thanks, Oppa.<br>-Playing
around, I see.

601
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,050
-Assemblyman.<br>-Aide.

602
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,770
Aide Choi, come and
have some with us.

603
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,160
Yes. Come here.

604
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,245
I think the general
meeting of the Gyeongjae

605
00:36:37,257 --> 00:36:40,030
local party members will
be held as planned.

606
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,660
What does that mean?

607
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,670
I thought Secretary
General Baek surrendered.

608
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,770
Park Choon Seop is being stubborn and even
Secretary General Baek cannot control him.

609
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,000
Then what will happen?

610
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,910
There is no other way than to attend the
meeting and to plead its injustice.

611
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:11,240
What if I still get impeached?
Do I then leave the party?

612
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,050
Yes.

613
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,708
We are going to prepare
Assemblyman's speech for the

614
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,440
general meeting and a plea
to the party members.

615
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,609
Secretary Kim, you search
the Assembly intranet and

616
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:27,760
find the materials I'm going
to dictate to you now.

617
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,570
Yes.

618
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,990
First of all, we are going to point out the
impracticality of the new harbor project

619
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,578
and the evils of
politicians' indiscriminate,

620
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,260
oversubscribed election
promises of development.

621
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,420
The basic data of the current status
of general matters in Gyeongjae;

622
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,793
the history of former
assemblymen's and governors'

623
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:43,380
promises of development and
whether they were carried out;

624
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,264
large-scale construction
projects halted in the

625
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:47,370
middle anywhere in the nation
during the last decade;

626
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,103
cases of projects that
were completed only to

627
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:52,740
turn into eyesores. All
of them, understand?

628
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,100
-Yes. I got it.<br>-Read it.

629
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,720
Umm, first, the new
port project...

630
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,070
Enough. Get that
organized, okay?

631
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,030
Park Choon Seop, you bastard.

632
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,350
Order all Pro-BH members in
Gyeongjae City to mobilize.

633
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,550
They are to attend the general meeting and
cast votes of confidence for Jin Sang Pil.

634
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,260
I understand.

635
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,924
But the number of
Anti-BH members is

636
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:22,790
overwhelming and we need
some special measure.

637
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,890
Under the circumstances, it's hard
to come up with a countermeasure.

638
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,630
For now, it's enough that we
make sure of this one thing.

639
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Never forgetting today's
ignominy and humiliation.

640
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,530
<i>Plea to the Gyeongjae
Party Members</i>

641
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,640
If I find even one typo, I'm going to make
you run laps around the Assembly Main Hall.

642
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,310
Don't worry.

643
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,030
Aish, should I have gone with
a more stoic-sounding title?

644
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,710
It feels too self-deprecating,
or maybe not?

645
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:06,970
Aide-nim, are you aware that
you're very elated right now?

646
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,080
-Me?<br>-Yes.

647
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,520
We're in an emergency situation
but you're enjoying it.

648
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,670
You see, I am the type that enjoys the
atmosphere of an emergency situation.

649
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,677
You know the political
field entails endless

650
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:25,110
EMERGENCY SITUATIONS: much
like a war without guns.

651
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,240
Aide, do you really like
politics that much?

652
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,856
Yes, it's one of very few
jobs that can change

653
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,160
the world, whether in
a big or small way.

654
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,660
The way I see it, I think everything
is turning for the worst.

655
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,660
That's because a person
like you contributes to it.

656
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,600
Be honest. How many
times have you voted?

657
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,990
Except for the absentee voting I did while
in the military, I never voted even once.

658
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,780
How pathetic you are.

659
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,000
What's so pathetic about me?

660
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,638
In this unfair world,
the vote is one thing

661
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,480
that you and a conglomerate
son have in common.

662
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
You threw that away?

663
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,400
There has to be a person
that I want to vote for.

664
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,820
If there's no one good, then
choose the lesser evil.

665
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,080
That way the most
evil won't win.

666
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,740
The one who isn't so bad is still a
bad person. Why would I do that?

667
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,380
Mr. Kim Gyu Hwan. Engrave this
saying of Plato on your mind.

668
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,160
"The price good men pay for
indifference to public affairs

669
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,960
is to be ruled by evil men."

670
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,300
<i>If you become an assemblyman
that people applaud,</i>

671
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,320
<i>then, I'll come down.</i>

672
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,180

Head of the local party chapter
Jin Sang Pil did not stop

at disappearing and causing
hit-list related disturbances.

678
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,042
He also committed an
unpardonable act of opposing

long cherished wish,

00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,700
namely securing a new southeast
regional harbor infrastructure here.

681
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,640
We can no longer acknowledge
Jin Sang Pil as our head

682
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,800
when he has dishonored Gyeongjae
City and Gookmin Party members.

683
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,400
Don't you think so everyone?

684
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,340
Don't be nervous.

<i>Republic of Korea Parliament</i>

686
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,400
Just read what it says here.

687
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,160
Aide Choi...

688
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,360
can I just say what
I want to say?

689
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,600
Do it that way.

690
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,240
Thank you.

691
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,160
Next, we will hear
President Jin Sang Pil's

692
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,460
refutation.

693
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,140
Please come up.

694
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,800
Yes, I am the current Assemblyman
representing Gyeongjae,

695
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,740
and President of the local
party chapter, Jin Sang Pil.

696
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:36,000
Well, because I am not
really crafty with words,

697
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,520
I'll briefly say a few words.

698
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,880
Actually, things like
votes of confidence...

699
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,020
I really am not afraid of that.
However,

700
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,200
the thing that really scares me
is that the people of Gyeongjae

701
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,780
may be fooled about
that absurd...

702
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,540
new harbor project.

703
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,940
Who is being fooled?

704
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,280
He's saying nonsensical things.

705
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,740
Even more scary is that new harbor
being built in our Gyeongjae City

706
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,100
by some illogical insistence.

707
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,280
Into that irrational project, without
any economic feasibility at all...

708
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,060
for sure, there will be poured from
a few tens of million of dollars...

709
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,820
to a few hundreds of millions.

710
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,660
That money belongs to the people of
Gyeongjae. It's the people's money.

711
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,140
Yes, of course, the
government and politicians...

712
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,500
will get behind us a lot
in the beginning...

713
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,540
granting special benefits. Because
they can't let the truth be known.

714
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:51,880
Even forcing ships headed to another
harbor to turn around toward our harbor...

715
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,660
They will make a big fuss,
doing whatever it takes.

716
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,020
So let's say that our
Gyeongjae City...

717
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,900
becomes a wealthy town,
with money to burn.

718
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:07,620
But is our Gyeongjae City
the only town in Korea?

719
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,140
Even if we have to suck all the
marrow out of other townspeople...

720
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,360
if only we can eat well and live
well, then is everything hunky-dory?

721
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,440
Is that something a local
assemblyman should say?!

722
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,500
Look here!

723
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,820
I'm not a city councilman.

724
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,680
I'm not a ward councilman. I
am a national assemblyman...

725
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,160
who must think of the whole
of the Korean people.

726
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,300
My Aide Choi In Kyung said this.

727
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,540
When you become
an assemblyman...

728
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,540
there is an oath you take.

729
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,840
Yes, I stammered a lot at that time.
It was very difficult

730
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,360
because everything was written
in Chinese characters.

731
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,180
What is written there...
is the people's liberty,

732
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,500
promoting welfare, putting
the national interest first,

733
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,560
conscience!

734
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,980
These three things are the gist.

735
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,700
I...

736
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,940
will not be a marketing
agent who makes a pitch...

737
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,980
for regional self-centeredness.

738
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:38,020
I! A real national assemblyman

739
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,700
who thinks of the whole country

740
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,980
and the people all together!

741
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,560
I!

742
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,960
I want to be a true
national assemblyman...

743
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,380
who can stand tall and proud...

744
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,940
before the people.

745
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,700
I truly want to be

746
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,520
that kind of assemblyman
of the Republic of Korea.

747
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,300
That's all.

752
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,080
Now we will vote.

753
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,840
How did it turn out?

754
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,420
Oh, really, okay. Good job.

755
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,000
Did the results come out?

756
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,680
By a 52% share of no confidence,
the impeachment succeeded.

757
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,520
Since they barely made it, I guess Jin
Sang Pil put up a pretty good fight.

758
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,180
Now, if Jin Sang Pil
just leaves the Party,

759
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,900
we can get Baek Do Hyeon.

760
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,960
Secretary General, you have to communicate
immediately with Assemblyman Jin.

761
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,980
Stay still.

762
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,680
We have to stop his
defection by any means.

defects...<br>-For God's sake!

00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,800

listless like this.

It's like you lost a battle,
but you won the war.

768

I did the right thing, right?

769
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,600
You were the best.

770
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,100
Then, it's enough.

771
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,100
If Aide Choi said I was the
best then it was the best.

772
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,120
You did well.

773
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,040
You did well.

774
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,200
I know that.

775
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,760
Why is he acting like that?

776
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,420
Assemblywoman Cheon.

777
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,180
It was a moving statement,
Assemblyman Jin.

778
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,720
Not at all.

779
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,800
But what brought
you to Gyeongjae?

780
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,260
Are you here to offer him
your party membership?

781
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,580
Well, if he wants to
come, I will not oppose.

782
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,740
The reason I came here is,

783
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,400
I wanted to apologize for
past troubles I caused you.

784
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,420
I've been following you since the
new harbor breeze started to blow.

785
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,160
Assemblyman Jin,

786
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,290
I'm sorry.

787
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:57,210
No.

788
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,510
Kim Gyu Hwan!

789
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,650
After praising a person whom you called
a son-of-a-bi*ch when you were drunk,

790
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,790
are you feeling awkward?

791
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:39,450
But why would a person like that, in
order to become an assemblyman...

792
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,690
betray the laid-off workers?

793
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,970
So off the wall... Why would
you bring that up here?

794
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,970
Yes, Sunbae-nim.

795
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,130
My beloved hoobae, In Kyung,

796
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,850
this time, I'd like to
take advantage of you.

797
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,090
What do you mean?

798
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,350
I've just heard the news
from Gyeongjae City.

799
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:08,570
Let my party recruit
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

800
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,390
You called him a scumbag.
Why all of a sudden?

801
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:15,550
What do you mean why? He's
going to defect anyway.

802
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:19,230
Belonging to the Korean Democratic Party is
a lot more snazzy than being independent.

803
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,650
For us, too, if we secure the
Gyeongjae City District,

804
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,249
we can pride ourselves on
the fact that we are a

805
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:24,970
national political party in
fact as well as in name.

806
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,930
Our Assemblyman is
a bit expensive.

807
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,090
How much are you going to
pay for the signing bonus?

808
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,430
I'll call him the
best assemblyman.

809
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:38,710
Wow, the terms are not bad.

810
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,817
But I don't think I can make our assemblyman
into a migratory bird (pejorative term

811
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:44,910
for politicians who change political
affiliations whenever that suits their needs).

812
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,710
- In Kyung.<br>- I'm sorry.
I am busy so...

813
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,950
Humph, this rascal...

814
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,490
The Korean Democratic
Party has informally

815
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:15,230
invited you to join their
party, but I declined it.

816
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,370
Wow, that defection thing...

817
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,330
is, I guess, scary indeed.

818
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,950
Even Secretary General
Baek surrendered.

819
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,170
And the opposition
parties are courting me.

820
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,430
What is this?

821
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,570
A defection statement for
the press conference.

822
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:46,430
You want me to defect?

823
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,890
I'm not that happy
about it, either.

824
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,750
But this is the
only way for now.

825
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,250
Defect for now and
stay independent

826
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,430
until Secretary General
Baek resigns from his post.

827
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,190
And then you can
return to the party.

828
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:04,750
But the party is not like a
bathroom you go in and out of.

829
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:09,690
Right, but the Gookmin Party will have
no choice but to accept you back.

830
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,070
Because you have
the casting vote.

831
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,690
What is a casting vote?

832
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,270
That one vote which resolves a
deadlock and decides the outcome.

833
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,770
That is what you are holding
right now, Assemblyman.

834
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,810
Not only can the majority government of the
governing party with its ratio of 151:149

835
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:28,150
be changed to a tie between
the parties, but also

836
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:30,190
in a deadlock situation between the
ruling and opposition parties,

837
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:34,610
your one vote can
change the landscape.

838
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,330
Still, I can't
allow a defection.

839
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,930
Just until Secretary
General Baek steps down.

840
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,990
Just a very brief
period will do.

841
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,930
After that, somehow, I

842
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:07,230
will get you Gookmin
Party's nomination.

843
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:13,090
Assemblyman, my goal

844
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:18,070
is to make you the next
assemblyman of Gyeongjae City.

845
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,170
Please concentrate
on our conversation.

846
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,410
What is that for you to be
fidgeting with it so much?

847
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,510
This?

848
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:41,750
It's the reason why I
became an assemblyman.

849
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,950
What?

850
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,790
Listen.

851
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:01,410
What is this for you to keep
telling me to listen...

852
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:07,310
<i>Sang Pil, it's me, Dal Soo.</i>

853
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:11,530
<i>My original wish was just
to get back to work.</i>

854
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,070
<i>But now I have one more.</i>

855
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:18,370
<i>That is for you, Sang
Pil, to do well.</i>

856
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,610
<i>That you become an assemblyman</i>

857
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:24,450
<i>who gives hope to
people like us.</i>

858
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,730
<i>When you become an assemblyman</i>

859
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,550
<i>who is applauded by the
people, I will come down.</i>

860
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:39,810
Aide Choi, what I
really want is...

861
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,650
to be applauded by the people.

862
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:48,670
A party nomination,
I can do without.

863
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,070
But a thing like defection...

864
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:56,170
I will never do it.

865
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:18,880
Assemblyman, then let's do this.

866
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:35,710
Secretary General, Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil
will hold a press conference this evening

867
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,350
and make an important
announcement.

868
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,050
They are going up!

869
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,810
I am Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

870
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,550
<i>I will read my statement
for the press conference.</i>

871
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,410
<i>For me, getting the Gookmin Party's
nomination for the next year's election</i>

872
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,330
<i>has become virtually impossible.</i>

873
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,810
<i>As such, I will tell you
about my next move.</i>

874
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:37,110
<i>From Gookmin Party, I...</i>

875
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:42,690
Stop that cliff-hanging and just
spit out that you will defect.

876
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:53,170
<i>I will not defect.</i>

877
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,910
<i>- I will not get hung up on a party
nomination, either.</i><br>- Secretary General!

878
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:01,830
<i>- I won't accept it even if they give
it to me.</i><br>- What the hell was that?

879
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,050
Yes, I won't accept it even
if they give it to me.

880
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,550
I won't because it's so filthy.
Right, never.

881
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:13,510
Instead, I will remain in the
party and take on another task.

882
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,468
As you know, in our Gookmin
Party, there are two

883
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,450
FACTIONS: the Pro-BH and
the Anti-BH persuasions.

884
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:23,570
<i>You all know, right? They fight day in
and day out, engaging in turf battles.</i>

885
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,870
They are pundits when it
comes to back stabbing.

886
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,591
Two factions like that...
Pack-tions (Korean

887
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:29,490
pronunciation is gaepa,
where gae can mean dogs).

888
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,990
In order to stand up
to these rotten packs,

889
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,830
I have decided to
form a new faction.

890
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:42,030
Forgetting all selfish interests and
greed, only on the side of the people,

891
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:44,070
according to the people's will,

892
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:47,590
doing what the people want, that
is what the faction is about.

893
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,410
Even though I am the
sole member right now,

894
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,650
yes, I'm sorry, no one
has joined yet...

895
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:55,670
I'm alone.

896
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:58,410
If there are assemblymen
who share my thoughts,

897
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,690
I will welcome them any time.

898
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:05,290
What my faction wants
is just one thing.

899
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:11,970
And that's their fellow countrymen's
warm encouragement and applause.

900
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,570
That is all.

901
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,330
A faction, all of a sudden...

902
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:23,070
What did that person just say?

903
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,690
Within the ruling party,

904
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:29,530
he means to play the opposition party.

905
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,766
- What?<br>- Assemblyman Jin
is right now saying

906
00:59:31,778 --> 00:59:33,750
that he'll use his
casting vote as a weapon

907
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:37,390
and form a one-man opposition
party within the ruling party.

908
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,250
I'm sorry.

909
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:46,090
When you came back to get me re-elected...

910
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,930
I failed you.

911
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:55,370
That is okay.

912
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:01,870
Right now, I have a new goal.

913
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,130
Because of the people's
overwhelming support,

914
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:11,130
a true people's assemblyman to whom

915
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:15,030
the party has no choice
but to give a nomination.

916
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:20,490
Assemblyman Jin, what is
the name of that faction?

917
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,370
Name?

918
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:29,450
The name my aide supports is...

919
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,710
<i>Gookmin (PEOPLE'S) Faction.</i>

920
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,170
Gookmin Faction, but

921
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:40,210
for a mere faction's name, I dislike

922
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:44,150
using that sublime word, "people."

923
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:47,330
So I don't like that much.

924
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:50,170
So our faction name is...

925
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:55,430
I like neither Anti-BH

926
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,610
nor Pro-BH.

927
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:02,350
I will just go by Indifferent-to-BH.

928
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:04,430
Indifferent-to-BH?

929
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,710
That idiot. He's an idiot.

930
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:11,050
Yes, I will choose Indifferent-to-BH.

931
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,170
I like the sound of that.

932
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,270
That is all.

933
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:27,430
Oh, I will give my warning
to the party leadership

934
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:31,390
and to the Pro- and Anti-BH factions.

935
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:34,030
I can look there and do it, right?

936
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,970
From now on, when the
party decides something,

937
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,290
make sure to discuss it with
the Indifferent-to-BH faction.

938
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:43,310
<i>If you look down on us
because of our small number,</i>

939
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,727
<i>and as you have been doing thus
far, if the Pro- and Anti-BH</i>

940
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:47,810
<i>factions engage in hanky-panky
and do shoddy work...</i>

941
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:50,410
<i>You just try that and see what happens...</i>

942
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,650
<i>In that event, the same
party color or whatever,</i>

943
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,430
<i>I will just kick your ass, all of you!</i>

944
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,550
<i>If you want to sanction me, sanction me.</i>

945
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,110
<i>If you want to expel me,
just try expelling me, huh?!</i>

946
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:02,830
Ugh, what should I do
to that wet blanket...

947
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:07,610
Me, Jin Sang Pil, the big boss of
the Indifferent-to-BH faction!

948
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:11,750
JSP! I will never get scared!

949
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,950
You better be prepared, huh?!

950
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,250
No, that...!

951
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,010
Do you understand?!

952
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:33,920
