Yes, this is Choi In Kyung.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,550
Yes, right now

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,960
I am an Aide to Jin Sang Pil.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,840
Yes, he is right next to me.

7
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,930
Take the call.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,650
Who is it that you
are all riled up?

9
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,010
Hello?

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,730
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.</i>

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,530
Yes, that's right. Who is it?

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,390
<i>I am the President.</i>

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,590
Oh, yes, Excellency...
I mean President.

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,350
<i>I am intently watching
what you are doing.</i>

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,460
Thank you. You must be busy
but you've even called me.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,080
<i>Soon, I'll relay my intention.
Work hard.</i>

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,810
Hello? President? Hello?

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,840
What did the VIP say?

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,480
He just says he's going
to send his message soon.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,830
He didn't say anything
more specific?

21
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,270
No.

22
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,850
Is this a warning for me
not to mess with him?

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,660
<i>I'll give you VIP's message.</i>

24
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,910
<i>He wants you to resign from the
Secretary General's position.</i>

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,140
Why are you doing this? I told you
that VIP doesn't want to see you.

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,440
Please tell him again
that I must see him.

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,640
Then do whatever you want.

28
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,850
This is quite
fun.<br><i>Episode 14.</i>

29
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,130
Please look into it. There's definitely
something going on in the BH.

30
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,770
Thanks, Officer Kim. I'll buy
you lunch sometime. Bye.

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,050
<i>Bi Gwang!<br>To go!</i>

32
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,890
To go, to go. This is fun.

33
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,390
Aide Choi, when are you going to hire
someone to replace Secretary Kim?

34
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,340
I don't have any plan. Why?

35
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,280
Then, at least change my partner.
Go, stop, go, stop everyday...

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,650
I'm dying here.

37
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,840
I'll tell him to
refrain from it.

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,230
So... why did
Secretary Kim quit?

39
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,400
Beats me. Maybe he really
hated his partner.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,660
What?

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,340
Yes, this is Choi In Kyung.

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,380
Yes, Chief Secretary.

43
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,980
Pardon?

44
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,870
Yes.

45
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,340
What...

46
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,550
Aide Choi. Where is the
hearing held again?

47
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,430
It looks like you'll have
to go some place else.

48
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,440
Where?

49
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,430
Blue House, the office
of the Secretary.

50
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,000
Huh?

51
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,310
Because of you, the VIP is
really having a difficult time.

52
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,790
Well, I didn't mean to. I
was just doing my job.

53
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,310
Is that why you called me? You
know I never get intimidated.

54
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,460
Why would I?

55
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,290
Assemblyman.

56
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,170
What did the Secretary say?

57
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,540
Because what I heard
was so absurd.

58
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,290
What did you hear?

59
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,490
Was I mistaken?

60
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,940
What did he say?

61
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,190
Yes, it's me.

62
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,110
Just a bit. Please give a bit of time.
I'll meet with you and tell you.

63
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,000
Elder.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,720
To me,

65
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,460
he asked me to be the Secretary
General of the Gookmin Party.

66
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,080
Secretary General?

67
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,460
Yes.

68
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,510
<i>You suffered a lot
all that time.</i>

69
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:59,520
<i>Syned & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

70
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,020
These people finally recognize how scary
the Indifferent-to-BH faction can be.

71
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,470
Secretary General? I should have asked
him to make me the party's head.

72
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,690
Right?

73
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,970
But this place is pretty grand.
Pretty grand.

74
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,490
You worked here, Aide Choi?

75
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,250
That's the kind of woman that I am.
Consider it an honor.

76
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,490
I see.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,240
Well, I did tell the Secretary that
I was going to think about it.

78
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,340
Is it really okay for a guy like
me to be Secretary General?

79
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,345
A few years ago, a
first-time proportional

80
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:39,420
representative of the
first opposition party

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,620
took the position of
Secretary General.

82
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,380
You taking the position wouldn't
be considered out of the ordinary.

83
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,680
But this is really odd.

84
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,880
Look. I did away with the
Prime Minister-designate.

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,751
And I demanded a special
prosecutor on the Babel thing,

86
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,680
so I've been chasing after one
thing right after another.

87
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,880
It is not like giving one more
piece of cake to the troublemaker.

88
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,990
Wanting me to be the Secretary
General is a little...

89
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,090
What VIP wants now by
enticing you to his side

90
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,010
is to raise his approval rating,
which has hit rock bottom.

91
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,580
And you will not only secure
the next election's nomination

92
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,880
but obtain the title of being the
close aide of the President.

93
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,180
Still, is it okay for him to
ladle things out like this?

94
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,280
As long as it's politically
beneficial, yesterday's enemy

95
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,620
becomes today's comrade.
That's the world of politics.

96
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,680
You call those things
political engineering.

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,460
What? Political engineering?

98
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,160
Yes.

99
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,010
Then, what will happen to
Secretary General Baek?

100
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,130
Did something bad happen?

101
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,300
Secretary General, in a few days

102
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,847
you know that there is an
election for the leader of

103
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,360
the Party chapter in the
district I am working on,

104
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:07,233
right?<br>(HCM IS A PARTY-APPOINTED

106
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,662
The current leader of the
party members is not

107
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:14,570
an assemblyman so I
thought it would be easy.

108
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,910
But he is pretty popular
among the party members.

109
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,610
So, I hope you'll give
a supporting fire...

110

<i>Choi In Kyung<br> Sunbae-nim, I
want to see you for a moment.</i>

111
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,490
Secretary General.

112
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,130
Let's talk later.

113
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,880
Thank you for coming.

114
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Since you said you had
something to say.

115
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,660
I know about your resigning
from your position.

116
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,800
Seeing how you know,

117
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,410
I guess the Elder has
embraced Assemblyman Jin.

118
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:27,140
Sunbae, you were always going
full speed ahead until now.

119
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,970
And there were too many burdens
that you had to carry.

120
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,100
When you resign, allow some
leeway for yourself and

121
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,780
look back on your
political life.

122
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,720
You used to call for conservatism with a
warm human face, reformed conservatism

123
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,840
that is not hung up
on vested interests.

124
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,320
I invested my hope in the
sunbae who was that person.

125
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:02,100
Please come back to
yourself of that time.

126
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,000
In Kyung.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,160
Yes, Sunbae.

128
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,550
I am thankful for your words but
one important fact is wrong.

129
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,500
Yes, Secretary. Relay
it to the Elder.

130
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,380
This Baek Do Hyeon will not

131
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,550
resign from the Secretary
General's position.

132
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:44,370
I will never voluntarily resign.

133
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,240
Sunbae.

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,350
What do you think about President
Seo's comment about your resignation?

139
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,570
If the one the President was referring to
was, indeed, me, I think he's mistaken.

140
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,450
If the President will see me, I am
willing to go and explain myself.

141
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,960
Are you saying you have
no thought of resigning?

142
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,890
Well, I don't remember having done any
wrong that requires my resignation.

143
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,410
This way.

144
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,350
Secretary General Baek, don't show your
ugly side and just resign promptly!

145
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,400
Why don't you stop saying
resign and tell me the reason.

146
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,870
You ran the party
into the ground!

147
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,400
I guess you are talking about.

148
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,177
Prime Minister-designate Joo
Cheol Soon's withdrawal and the

149
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:50,860
passage of the Babel Tower
City special prosecution bill.

150
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,977
But the party floor
leaders in charge of the.

151
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:55,070
Assembly must bear
responsibility for those.

152
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,370
Even if the party was run into the ground
as you say, Supreme Councilwoman Park,

153
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,838
don't you think that before the
Secretary General, the Party.

154
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,930
Leader and Supreme Council
should bear responsibility?

155
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,740
What? Hey, you, Baek Do Hyeon!

156
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,110
But, why are you using
informal speech with him?

157
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,550
Assemblywoman Hong, don't side
with him and just be quiet.

158
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,660
Secretary General Baek, if you keep doing
this, we can forcefully remove you.

159
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,260
Before it's too late,
resign honorably.

160
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,410
I have no thought whatsoever
of voluntarily resigning.

161
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,570
Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon!

162
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,450
But, how can the so-called
Supreme Council

163
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,760
not even take care of a
mere Secretary General?

164
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,090
That's why you get called
the Lowest Council.

165
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,010
Where do you think this is,
to barge in like this?

166
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:57,870
I have movies I want to show
Secretary General Baek, so I'm here.

167
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,380
What movie? "Avatar"?

168
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,450
Avatar, my butt.

169
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,320
There are so many Korean movies
that far excel "Avatar"...

170
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,350
Here, take a look. "Leave
While They Are Clapping,".

171
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,820
"When You Leave, without Adieu"!

172
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:23,510
Secretary General Baek,
just leave promptly.

173
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,880
Don't you have any pride?

174
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,160
Secretary General
Baek, resign already!

175
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,340
The die has been cast already.

176
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,860
Yes, resign!

177
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,750
Just resigning will
be good and pleasant!

178
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,800
Do you know how serious the
situation is right now?

179
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,700
This is the perfect time, okay?

180
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,160
Step down.

181
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,730
A Gallup poll showed that the opinions
favoring your resignation are only 30%.

182
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,460
Those opposed to it are 50%. If you
hang in, you have a winning chance.

183
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,150
Tell Assemblywoman Hong Chan
Mi to schedule meetings

184
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,110
with Assembly news desk chiefs.

185
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,410
But... I can't get in touch
with Assemblywoman Hong.

186
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,480
I think an order has been handed
down from the Blue House.

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,950
So I've come all the way to
your company.<br>- Thank you.

195
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,100
Because of these kinds of company
owners,<br>even good ones get cursed at.

196
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,220
But this president
did go to jail.

197
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,340
But he has committed
pretty serious crimes.

198
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,580
And saying our unpaid wages can
be addressed in a civil lawsuit,

199
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,350
the government keeps
sidestepping our problem.

200
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,740
The way I see it, the president
certainly siphoned money to elsewhere.

201
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,340
Assemblyman, please
use your influence.

202
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,940
No matter how hard we
scream, it just won't work.

203
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,760
Yes, I understand.
I'll do my utmost...

204
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,090
I will really try hard.

205
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,880
Assemblyman Jin, Aide Choi is
ordering us back as soon as possible.

206
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,900
Why?

207
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,380
Baek Do Hyeon is getting
crucified right now.

208
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,470
Huh?

209

211
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,540
The Anti-BH faction
can be like that.

212
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,900
But just at a word from the President,
how can the party leadership...

213
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,540
Wow, how can they do this to him,
between the same Pro-BH members?

214
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,850
There is no permanent friend or
enemy in the world of politics.

215
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,270
This is the outcome of cold calculations
and the workings of survival instinct.

216
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,080
Rather than Baek Do Hyeon, a
power with a very murky future,

217
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,570
they chose Seo Dae Han,
the current, live power.

218
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,520
Of course, cash is
better than a check.

219
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,500
This kind of thing is called
political engineering, right?

220
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,840
The thing that you talked about.

221
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,860
Well, yes. I guess
you can say that.

222
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,010
Even so, Secretary General
is persevering pretty well.

223
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,095
He is trying to drag
this out so that he can

224
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:10,110
find a way to reconcile
with the President.

225
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,180
We shouldn't just
sit around either.

226
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,486
Of course. Secretary General
Baek must step down

227
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:19,680
so our Assemblyman can
gobble up Gyeongje City.

228
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,541
Even if Secretary General
Baek resigns, another

229
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:23,700
candidate will come out from
the Pro-BH faction anyway.

230
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,150
Whether our Assemblyman
can get the nomination...

231
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,580
Assemblyman, you might as
well also take action now.

232
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,260
I have no interest in
this kind of mud fight.

233
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,060
Dong Cheon, there's a standing committee
meeting today, right?<br>- Yes, there is.

234
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,450
Hurry up and prepare. All
of you, go back to work.

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:11,040
I have to talk about the unpaid
wages today, without fail.

240
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,690
Assemblyman Jin, are the Gookmin
Party members not attending today?

241
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:20,480
No, they are very busy studying
about political engineering.

242
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,040
How come Korean Democratic
Party members are not here?

243
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,050
Over there, they are not just
studying but having a symposium.

244
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,760
What?<br>- A party convention.

245
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,340
Oh, that's right. They
are doing that today.

246
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,480
Then, I guess I can't talk about this.
I have to talk about this.

247
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,300

I talk about this? What can we do?

Wow, what will Assemblyman

254
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,370

255
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,530
I am sorry to come to a funeral house (IN A
SADDER SITUATION) to bemoan my misfortune.

256
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,180
You snarled at him too much during the
period leading up to the convention, Punk!

257

Do you know what Oh Sae
Chang's close aide

258
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,400

majored in education,

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,590
I should look for a place where I can
open up a cram school next year.

260
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,820
I told the party boss that I'm
going to switch party affiliation.

Do Hyeon, you take the assemblymen who
favor you and leave the party too.

265
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,180
That makes no sense.

266
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,200
Why doesn't this make any sense? Political
parties breaking up before an election...

267
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,560

I've already come up with
a plausible cause too.

270
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,899
I will take a stand against
regional political parties, smug

271
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:01,930
in their regional popularity,
and build a national party!

272
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,026
I will realize a true policy-focused
party that will transcend left-right

273
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:09,980

principles of practical politics!

Don't hastily assume things.

Secretary General.

282
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,970
Secretary General,
what brings you here?

283
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,820
As the leader of the Pro-BH
faction, I came to make a proposal.

284
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,980
What do you mean, proposal?

285
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,605
I'm sure everyone knows
there's talk about a

00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:22,430
party realignment with Jo
Woong Gyu's defection.

287
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,200
So, are you saying that we should
leave the party as a group?

288
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,060
Obviously the political situation in the
immediate future is extremely uncertain.

A 20% approval rating for
the President entering

293
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,590

to set up a private meeting

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,810
not to stupidly take in

Stupidly?

319
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:36,530

By the way, do I have
to do it?<br>- Pardon?

329
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,760
I mean, if I play pat-a-cake

00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:47,610
Babel Tower City special
prosecution bill...

336
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,920
Until when do you want to clean up the
matters that someone else brought up?

337
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,200
Real politics is what
you have to make.

338
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,810
If I become Secretary
General, what can I make?

339
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,060
Renovation of the party nomination
and reform of the party.

340
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,871
The chance to correct
our politics right from

341
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:06,400
the root, fundamentally,
has come to you.

342
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,340
Really...

343
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:19,320
Excuse me. Assemblyman, a strange
article appeared on the internet.

344
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,090
What kind of article?

345
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,290
Assemblyman Jin, you are the next
Secretary General-designate...

346
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,900
Right now, what kind
of article appeared?

347
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,790
What were you listening
to while I was talking?

348
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,240
Assemblyman, if the reporter
was not out of his mind,

349
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,850
he should have written it as
some kind of possibility.

350
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,450
It looks as though he wrote
it while he was drunk.

351
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,020
Should I have his press pass
revoked at the reception desk?

352
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,120
Seriously!

353
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,290
Who on earth leaked
it to the press?

354
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,510
<i>Seeing how you know,</i>

355
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,860
<i>I guess the Elder has
embraced Assemblyman Jin.</i>

356
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,740
Why?

357
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,940
<i>Aiee, Assemblyman Jin is inside.</i>

358
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,240
<i>Wait for a moment.</i>

359
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,700
<i>For a moment for me, also.</i>

360
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,630
<i>What are you doing?</i>

361
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,070
<i>I will tell him so please
wait a little bit.</i>

362
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,840
Please, for a moment.

363
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,800
Wait a little bit!<br>-
Assemblyman Jin!

364
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,260
Ah, Aide Oh!

365
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,920
Now...

366
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,850
Assemblyman Jin said he has
no comment about this matter.

367
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,410
Assemblyman Jin! For a
moment.<br>- Is the article true?

368
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,570
That is... For us...

369
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,055
<i>For a moment!<br> Please
keep your voices down.</i>

370
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,160
<i><br> Assemblyman Jin!</i>

371
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,840
<i>Assembly Jin, is the content
of the article true?</i>

372
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
Have you heard the story about
the Secretary General-designate?

373
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,870
Yes. It is true that I
received the proposal.

374
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,600
I said I would think about it.

375
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,780
Let's go.

376
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,790
When did you receive
the proposal?

377
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,070
<i>Chief! That article is
not a false report.</i>

378
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,500
In Kyung! In Kyung!

379
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,180
In Kyung!

380
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:15,440
Ms. In Kyung... Is it true
what Assemblyman Jin said?

381
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,040
Yes.

382
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,660
Dae Bak! <br>- An event!

383
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,040
How can the President act this way?
Who has worked so hard meanwhile?

384
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,090
Such a rogue villain!

385
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,800
If Assemblyman Jin becomes Secretary
General, all of us may get kicked out.

386
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,020
Don't you think so,
Assemblywoman Hong?

387
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:49,260
<i>Syned & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles
by The Assembly Team @ Viki.</i>

388
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,990
Secretary General!

389
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,030
We will entrust

390
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,220
our political lives to
you, Secretary General.

391
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,990
<i>You are doing too much!</i>

392
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,910
A special presidential pardon?

393
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,230
Yes... The chairman...

394
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,413
There is a rumor that he will
be released from jail at

395
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:12,580
the end of the month by a
special presidential pardon.

396
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,250
Oh, no. That's too much.

397
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:24,000
Aide Choi, did you find out? Will he
receive a special presidential pardon?

398
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,420
The government refused to
confirm the information.

399
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,260
Because it is
personal information,

400
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,610
they can't reveal it even if
an assemblyman requests it.

401
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,090
Seriously, these people...

402
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,370
Aide Choi. Let's do it. The
press conference!<br>- Pardon?

403
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,770
I am opposing the special presidential
pardon for the entrepreneurs including him.

404
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:50,700
Really, the employees didn't get paid
so they are starving on the street.

405
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,659
What did they do so well
that they will receive a

406
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:56,760
special presidential pardon
and get released? Right?

407
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:04,030
I fully agree with you. But
just let it go this time.

408
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,406
What are you saying?<br>-A
special presidential

409
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,090
pardon is decided
by the President.

410
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,710
While the President and Secretary General
are fighting under water right now,

411
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,190
you can't fall into hostility
with the President.

412
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,810
Why, if I stand out, you are afraid
I won't become Secretary General?

413
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,340
I don't care about that, so
arrange a press conference soon.

414
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,630
I have explained so much to you,

415
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,140
the reason why you have to
become Secretary General.

416
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,760
Well, let's do the
press conference!

417
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,310
Think again, please.<br>- No.
I will proceed.

418
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,200
I can't do it.<br>- Aide Choi!

419
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,940
I can't do it!

420
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,490
Do you think something will be
changed even if you act like this?

421
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,610
No, nothing will be changed.

422
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,250
However, think about it.
Is there any guarantee

423
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:47,970
that you will get another
chance like this again?

424
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,598
Do you want to throw away the
position of Secretary General over

425
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,210
the matter of a special pardon for
an unscrupulous entrepreneur?

426
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,600
I absolutely cannot
agree with you.

427
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,980
Aide Choi.

428
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,570
Yes.

429
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,930
Do you know?<br> - What about?

430
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,680
Right now, when I see you,

431
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:15,370
you look like a technician, a
political engineering technician.

432
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,520
I am very interested in watching your
bloody fight with the President.

433
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,810
I have been a comrade
with Elder for 10 years.

434
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,690
It's excessive to express
it as a bloody fight.

435
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,550
It is said that political power
does not last for 10 years.

436
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,680
If the power doesn't
last for 10 years, will

437
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,450
the political comrade
last for 10 years?

438
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,700
What is your business?

439
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,980
I want to receive help
from the Anti-BH faction.

440
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,310
What's the condition?<br>-
Right now, there are about

441
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,900
35% of Anti-BH Assemblymen
in Gookmin Party.

442
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:25,110
I will ensure that you keep this
ratio at next year's nomination.

443
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,110
45 percent.

444
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,340
40 percent.

445
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:47,000
Do you think you will get nominations
from Secretary General Jin Sang Pil?

446
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,460
I will send Assemblyman
Kang Sang Ho.

447
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:05,300
Wow, this house is really nice.

448
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,580
Really it's nice.

449
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,280
Assemblywoman Hong, the
price went up a lot?

450
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,120
Sit down please.

451
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,720
Yes.

452
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,675
This looks like Chiang Kai-shek (LEADER
OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA) and Mao.

453
00:31:18,687 --> 00:31:21,210
Zedong (CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY
OF CHINA) united their countries.

454
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,680
Secretary General, please
tell us your intention now.

455
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,250
If Elder doesn't change his position by
the National Assembly session tomorrow,

456
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,420
Pro-BH members who follow
me will switch to Anti-BH.

457
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Both of you announce
the joint statement.

458
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,500
With what kind of subject?

459
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,250
Secession from the party.

460
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,755
Secession from the party?
Secretary General!

461
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,960
I haven't heard about
secession yet...

462
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,780
It is not us, but the President.

463
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,500
President?

464
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,550
I will summarize the statement.

465
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,967
The essence of the existing state
of affairs that makes the ruling

466
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:15,540
party the Blue House's pawn is a
resurrection of corrupt politics.

467
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,742
The President leaves the
party to the assemblymen

468
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,570
and members and withdraws
from the party.

469
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,820
The President's term lasts for 5 years
but the party must last for 100 years.

470
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:30,290
Hopefully, giving up your lingering
attachment to the party,

471
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:36,510
you will devote yourself only to the
citizens during the remainder of your term.

472
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,030
Secretary... General Baek,
this seems too strong.

473
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,160
Secretary General, we are
confronting the President.

474
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,020
I already delivered my
intention to Chief Secretary.

475
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,370
Whether this statement will be announced
or thrown into the garbage bin...

476
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,060
it depends on Elder's decision.

477
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,550
<i>Right now, when I see you,</i>

478
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:16,400
<i>you look like a technician, a
political engineering technician.</i>

479
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,040
<i>BH Chief Secretary.</i>

480
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,780
Yes. Chief Secretary.

481
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,360
Pardon?

482
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,550
BH called us. At the National Assembly
session tomorrow, Secretary General Baek

483
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,520
will request the President's
secession from the party.

484
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,440
Yes?

485
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,230
Wow, Secretary General
Baek is really brave.

486
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,650
BH decided to confront him, too.

487
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,620
How?

488
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,400
BH will appoint you as Secretary General
at the National Assembly session tomorrow.

489
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,400
What? We haven't decided it yet.

490
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,730
You must make a statement of acceptance of
the position of Secretary General tomorrow.

491
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,462
As soon as you finish your
speech, under the name of the.

492
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:06,370
Supreme Council of the party, the
party delegates will declare

493
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,240
non-confidence in Secretary
General Baek and

494
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,690
appoint you as
Secretary General.

495
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,620
What is this, without
any discussion with me?

496
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,690
What do you think about it?

497
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,690
I will follow your decision.

498
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,060
Then...

499
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,810
Aide Choi?

500
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,950
I am sorry about earlier.

501
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,650
I spoke without thinking.

502
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,730
No. They were not wrong words.

503
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,870
They were wrong words.

504
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,150
You are still upset.

505
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,970
I am sorry.

506
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,233
When a man like you becomes an
assemblyman, I don't want you

507
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:56,900
to become a politician who
flashes briefly and disappears.

508
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,600
Your goal is to receive
the public's applause but

509
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:06,100
my goal is to get such an
assemblyman re-elected.

510

<i>Syned & ripped by bozxphd Subtitles

511
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,400
Dad!<br>- Huh?

512
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,820
Phone.

513
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,170
Who is Baek Do Hyeon?

514
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,710
<i>Baek Do Hyeon.</i>

515
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,740
What brought you
all the way here?

516
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,990
The person who will fight
with the President tomorrow?

517
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,010
This neighborhood is very quiet
even though it is in Seoul.

518
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,270
Are you accepting the position
of Secretary General?

519
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,620
Whew. You came here because
you are getting anxious.

520
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,251
What should I do? Because
the Indifferent-to-BH

521
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:57,630
has never been promoted
by the head before,

522
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,560
I can't decide.

523
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,090
What should I do?

524
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,190
Just be satisfied now with
your national popularity.

525
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:08,180
Being Secretary General is
not something you can do.

526
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,330
You appear to be
scaring me a lot.

527
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,430
I just might do it.

528
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,890
I have waited on the
Elder for 10 years.

529
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,360
Even if you should become
the Secretary General,

530
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,112
you will only be dishonored
as the Secretary General

531
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:30,940
with the shortest term in the
Gookmin Party's history.

532
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,590
I can't help it.

533
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,980
I will be Secretary General.

534
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,430
If you ignore my warning,

535
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:40,121
if you become Secretary General
tomorrow, we will declare

536
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,370
that the President must
withdraw from the party.

537
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,190
You can count on that.

538
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,300
Assemblyman Jin, you will be buried so deep
you will never be able to dig yourself out.

539
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,340
I will accept the
Secretary General's post.

540
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,770
Think carefully.

541
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,100
The Spoilsport originally
doesn't think a lot.

542
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,240
<i>Gookmin Party Emergency
General Meeting.</i>

543
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,590
<i>AGENDA: Party Normalization
After Crisis.</i>

544
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,203
<i>I am at the National
Assembly where an emergency</i>

545
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:40,370
<i>meeting of the Gookmin
party is being held.</i>

546
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,315
<i>President Seo Dae Han's demand

stories of a political shuffle.</i>

550
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:52,360
<i>Today's meeting is expected to be
a turning point in the situation.</i>

551
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,230
<i>In this situation...</i>

552
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,363
<i>Yes, while I am speaking
at this moment, Secretary.</i>

553
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,310
<i>General Baek Do Hyeon
is making his entrance.</i>

554
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,260
My position is firm. I
am standing my ground.

555
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,330
If you want to remove me
as Secretary General,

556
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,630
find an appropriate ground for disciplinary
sanction, and get ready to sanction me.

557
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,280
How dare you talk
about discipline?

558
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,740
Stop being absurd and
step down honorably!

559
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,810
How can we drag down
the Secretary General?

560
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,630
What are you doing while
he's still talking?!

561
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,190
Be quiet!

562
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,740
You be quiet!

563
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,260
<i>Get down. Down.</i>

564
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,480
My fellow countrymen.

565
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,860
And my Gookmin Sunbaes
and fellow members...

566
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,070
Regardless of my
faults, I regret that

567
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,880
an event as unfortunate as the
one that has happened today

568
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,380
had to happen.

569
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,410
As Secretary General

570
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,390
I bow my head before the
citizens and offer my apology.

571
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,530
Don't just apologize.
Resign honorably.

572
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,180
Stop clapping!

573
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,510
Get down now! Get down!

574
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,350
Just Resign!

575
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:35,370
Well, as expected the devil is good.
Baek Do Hyeon appears pitiable.

576
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,000
Because our citizens have
a lot of compassion...

577
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,400
they will put pressure
on the President.

578
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,980
The basic problem is Jin
Sang Pil, the hopeless guy.

579
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,586
Members take a firm stance on
Baek Do Hyeon's resignation

580
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:02,300
as Secretary General which
he says is impossible!

581
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,130
That's all.

582
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,170
VIP hasn't made any moves yet?

583
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,180
No.

584
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,030
It's not too late to reconsider
the defection declaration.

585
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,190
If one draws a sword,
one should wield it.

586
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,760
At this rate, something
disastrous could happen.

587
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,600
That's what makes
politics interesting.

588
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,200
<i>Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil
will make a statement.</i>

589
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,340
Yes.

590
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,570
The leader of the
Indifferent-to-BH faction,

591
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,760
I am Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil.

592
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,860
If I...

593
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,390
were to become the
Secretary General,

594
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,240
let me tell you the first
things I'm going to be doing.

595
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,370
It's the acceptance speech.

596
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:29,720
First, the nominations that are shared
among the Pro-BH and Anti-BH factions.

597
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,850
I'm going to get rid
of those first.

598
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,005
The leader of the Pro-BH
faction and So-and-So

599
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:39,510
Hong who always
follows him around...

600
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:44,200
The leader of the Anti-BH faction and Mr.
Avatar right next to him...

601
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:51,070
I will never give nominations
to those assemblymen

602
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,790
who lead the faction battle.

603
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,060
If you're just going to
talk nonsense, step down!

604
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,480
Let him talk!

605
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,200
How dare you order me around!<br>- What
are you talking about right now?

606
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,010
And, I'm going to make a ruling party
whose level is equal to the Blue House.

607
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,660
I'm going to push forward
things that are done right,

608
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,090
and oppose to death
the wrong things.

609
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,008
If the President orders
some weird errands as if

610
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,770
the party is some kind
of a branch in Yeouido,

611
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,180
be it some kind of an order, a call for
a favor, or a request for cooperation,

612
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,920
I'm never going to do it.

613
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,730
Is he now saying he's going to
be the Secretary General or not?

614
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:31,960
Let's listen some more.<br>-
Hurry and step down!

615
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,230
And the assemblymen here.
Yes, well,

616
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,310
now that I've been around here for a while,
there are a lot of good assemblymen, too.

617
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:45,060
There are quite a few. I should reward
them of course, reward them a lot.

618
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,980
Publicize them a lot, too. But

619
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,210
the assemblymen who desert their
own principles and stay at the.

620
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:56,040
Assembly only in order to become
employees of Gookmin Corporation;

621
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,825
Those who do other things
instead of attending

622
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:00,920
important meetings
at the Assembly;

623
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,971
Those assemblymen who,
when the aides pour their

624
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:04,710
efforts into drafting
the questionnaires,

625
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:10,320
they walk around showing off their gold
badges without even taking a peek at them:

626
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,630
Be careful. If I ever catch you,

627
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,590
it's going to happen in the blink
of an eye. You'll be surprised!

628
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,930
Hey, Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil! Stop
the nonsense and get down here!

629
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,180
Is he a thug or what?!

630
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,330
He has no respect for elders.
Get down here immediately!

631
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:30,750
Assemblyman Jin. Stop that talk and
just make the acceptance speech.

632
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,480
Don't you see that's what I'm doing?
You be careful, too.

633
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,180
What are you doing now?

634
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:49,360
I'm saying, if it's the Secretary
General who does those things,

635
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,190
then I'll accept it.

636
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,500
It's none other than JSP,
Assemblyman Jin Sang Pil,

637
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,350
the most popular guy in Yeouido, the
leader of Indifferent-to-BH faction.

638
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:06,330
When he becomes the
Secretary General,

639
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:11,010
shouldn't he do those things at least
to be able to save his face a bit?

640
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:15,360
But I'm sure he's not appointing
me to this to do those things.

641
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,720
Why? Because those people who are
experts at political engineering

642
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,800
picked me after punching
in the calculator!

643
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,020
Political engineering?

644
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,552
Assemblymen here, by any
chance do you know Mi.

645
00:44:34,564 --> 00:44:36,800
Bang Precision Engineering
Technologies, Ltd.?

646
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,790
The chairman of that company went
bankrupt on purpose and ran away,

647
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,250
so the employees didn't
get paid at all.

648
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,907
Right now, the employees
demonstrate in front of the.

649
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:50,790
National Assembly building by
putting up a tent every day

650
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,080
to receive their unpaid salary.

651
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:58,340
The chairman committed a lot of
wrongdoings as well and went to jail.

652
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:03,810
But soon, he will be released from the
jail with a special amnesty or something.

653
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,780
Well, Assemblymen here, did you know about
it? You didn't know about it, right?

654
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,910
Mi... Bang... Precision? Well...

655
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,360
Today's my first time hearing about it.
Do you know about it?

656
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,550
There is no way for
you to know it!

657
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:21,860
Everyday, you are studying so hard!
The political engineering!

658
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,050
What on earth is the Secretary General
position? What is so great about it?

659
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,720
Everyday you try only to read his mind!
Everyday you go back and forth in a flock!

660
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,250
That's why, before our
eyes, before our noses,

661
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,710
so many pitiful people are
always, always, crying,

662
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:43,190
Everyone can't see that. <br>All the
assemblymen and assemblywomen.

663
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,290
This punk has a way with words.

664
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,930
Executive Director Baek. No,
Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon.

665
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,180
I won't do it.

666
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,112
Until the day when the East
Sea's waters and<br>Mt. Baekdu

667
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:03,730
are dry and worn away.<br><i> (LYRICS
OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM)</i>

668
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,930
Until finishing the national
anthem and sounding a beep.

669
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,420
So do it for a very long
time, Secretary General.

670
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,600
Do Hyeon has been to the Palace

671
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,480
Yes, Elder.

672
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,350
<i>Come by in the evening.
Let's have dinner.</i>

673
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,040
Yes, I understand.

674
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,810
This is a real plea to you.

675
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,280
Please let me not ask
this kind of plea, again.

676
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:43,720
Stop political engineering please!
Let's do politics! Politics!

677
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,350
According to my researching
about the politics:

678
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,469
We shall fulfill a role
in assuring all citizens

679
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:52,520
are leading a worthwhile
and dignified life,

680
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,930
promoting the mutual
understanding, and

681
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:02,170
maintaining the public order.

687
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,930
Yes? Aide Choi.

688
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,990
Secretary Kim is preparing
for the civil service exam.

689
00:47:58,990 --> 00:47:59,860
Civil service?

690
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,520
But how did you know
that, Aide Choi?

691
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,300
Without me knowing, the two of
you have been keeping in touch?

692
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,950
I got an email.

693
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,600
Please review the incoming bills which
have been requested for joint submission.

694
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,660
How can I know all of them just looking at
them? I need explanations. First sit here.

695
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:22,190
And I saved this... Eat this.

696
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,302
I'm due to have tea with
a reporter so I have to

697
00:48:25,314 --> 00:48:27,590
prepare the materials. I
will let Aide Seo in.

698
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,470
But...

699
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,420
This time, her grudge
lasts for a long time.

700
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:41,290
You kicked out the Secretary General
position. Of course, she got upset.

701
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,860
Secretary Oh, have some.

702
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,510
No, thank you. Look at these
consignment expenses.

705

Sunbae Jo Woong Gyu, I haven't been able to
contact you and I'm concerned about you.

706
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,460
When you get this
message, please call.

707
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,730
Hello, Assemblywoman Hong.

708
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,100
Why is she like that?

709
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,290
Say there. Say there,
Secretary Byeon!

710
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:32,720
Can you please play Go-Stop
just with your hands?

711
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,740
Okay.

712
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,340
<i>Way to go. I will
blow it all up.</i>

713
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:57,830
Aide Choi, this resolution...

714
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,254
I don't understand well...
this part...

715
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:03,310
<i>'Establishing the system
of common prosperity...'</i>

716
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:06,350
Aide Seo is responsible
for resolutions.

717
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,980
Assemblyman, are you
wondering about anything?

718
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,780
I will be happy to explain.

719
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,030
Oh, it's okay.

720
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,570
What makes you so giddy?

721
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,300
Haven't you heard the
news about Madam Hong?

722
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,206
What about Assemblywoman Hong?
<br> -At the district.

723
00:50:37,218 --> 00:50:38,730
Madam Hong had marked
as her territory,

724
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,860
there was an election for selecting the
leader of the party chapter today.

725
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,220
She was defeated badly by the current
leader of the party chapter. Yoohoo!

726
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,740
Then, isn't she going to get
nominated there next year?

727
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,860
Probably not!<br>- Since she was crucified
by the local party members,

728
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,570
it won't be easy
to get nominated.

729
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:58,200
If Madam Hong shows up at the main building
next year after losing her gold badge,

730
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,340
I will really ignore her.

731
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,520
Assemblywoman Hong!

732
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,480
Where is Secretary General?

733
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,090
He is outside right now.

734
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,800
Where outside?<br>- Yes?

735
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,570
Where?!

736
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:23,772
I am regretful to hear the
result of the election

737
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:24,900
for selecting the leader
of the party chapter.

738
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,740
What?

739
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,530
Regretful? If Secretary General
had supported me properly,

740
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,550
would it have happened this way?

741
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,863
It's a misunderstanding,
Assemblywoman.<br>

742
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:35,650
What?

743
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,110
Misunderstanding? Tell
Secretary General.

744
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:49,360
I want to hear the explanation
from him as soon as possible.

745
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,110
A national political party
promoting the middle line...

746
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,750
My challenge to become the cornerstone in
the foundation of such a national party

747
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,740
has failed.

748
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:28,300
However, I will start
taking up a new challenge.

749
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,898
Leaving behind the worn out
liberals, I am being embraced

750
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,960
by the arms of the
future-oriented conservatives.

751
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,630
It's not for criticism without
providing alternatives.

752
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:43,280
I'm doing it in order to join hands
with responsible political power.

753
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,450
I have decided to join
the Gookmin Party.

754
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,990
Finally, I would like to
express my gratitude for

755
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:59,820
my lifelong friend and true comrade,
Secretary General Baek Do Hyeon.

756
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,780
In Kyung.

757
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,420
Are you disappointed?

758
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,780
Ultimately, is securing the nomination
and being elected in the next election

759
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,520
more important than
your political beliefs?

760
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,860
Choi In Kyung.<br>- Do
Hyeon, it's fine.

761
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,721
See it from my viewpoint, In Kyung...
There have been politicians

762
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:41,280
who believed that their creed
was the most important.

763
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,110
So the pure-hearted were made fun of
and were defeated in the elections.

764
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:48,450
But In Kyung, the
fact is it's scary.

765
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,550
Aren't you afraid of having fingers
pointed at you as a migratory bird?

766
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:57,300
A migratory bird can fly farther
than a bird whose wings are clipped.

767
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,740
Because in order to fly
a bird must exist...

768
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:16,360
Aide Choi! Aide Choi! Which
past conference is this from?

769
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,060
Secretary Song, did Aide Choi
already leave for the day?

770
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,860
No, she just went out for
a breath of fresh air.

771
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,400
What fresh air?
<br> The Jo Woong Bird.

772
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,500
It seems she's upset about
that Jo Woong bird.

773
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,800
Jo Woong Bird? What
is the Jo Woong bird?

774
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,193
The migratory bird who
chose the Gookmin Party

775
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:43,030
as his new habitat,
that Jo Woong bird!

776
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:46,230
Aide Choi.

777
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,900
I'll be going home now.

778
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:02,490
Come here and sit first.

779
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,440
Well, I don't want to drink.

780
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,110
Just drink a little, okay?

781
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:12,170
When you're sad,
it's best to drink.

782
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,030
When you drink, it's best
to do it with a friend.

783
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,850
Friend?<br>- Outside of
work, we're friends.

784
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,530
We're about the same age.

785
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:24,030
What are you doing? Sit down.

786
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,420
Just hold on and let's
have a drink together.

787
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,700
There are a lot of things
that I'm sorry to you for.

788
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:43,110
Stop being angry now.

789
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,300
Do you think I'm angry
because of you?

790
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,280
Aren't you?

791
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:55,150
It's because I'm embarrassed.

792
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,780
What are you talking about?

793
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:01,900
You caught me, Assemblyman.

794
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,750
About me... being a
political engineer.

795
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:12,300
Ay, that was just me spewing
out words without thinking.

796
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,720
Ahjumma, please give
us more soju here.

797
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,610
Okay.

798
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:28,900
When I think about it,

799
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,900
the things that I was
confident that if I did well,

800
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:39,000
the things at which I thought I was
excellent compared to others...

801
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:43,900
But it's all mostly just

802
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:48,710
a big mess of cheap tricks.

803
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:52,400
Those cheap tricks

804
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,570
are what people like
Secretary General Baek,

805
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,570
those political engineers, do.

806
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:05,490
What you do is art. Art!

807
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:08,010
A-R-T.<br>- Bastard.

808
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:12,600
I'm praising you, but how
could you curse at me...

809
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,530
Are you in a drunken
frenzy?<br>- What?

810
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:19,450
Are you saying politics is
the art of the possible?

811
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,570
When did I... Seriously...

812
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:29,920
Yes, Baek Do Hyeon.
Yes, Jo Woong Gyu.

813
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,490
You two have driven a nail
into your hoobae's heart.

814
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:40,360
I'll see how you two
do good politics.

815
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,740
Ahjumma, one more
soju here, please!

816
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,740
What are you talking about, one more?
That makes no sense. Stop it now.

817
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,813
Today, I'm Golden Bell here.
<br> (The Golden.

818
00:57:48,825 --> 00:57:49,840
(BELL PAYS DRINK FOR
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE.)

819
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,010
What Golden Bell now?
You're just cursing.

820
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,360
You don't know Golden Bell?

821
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,360
Assemblywoman Hong
Chan Mi was pissed.

822
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,050
How are the other assemblymen's
reactions to bringing in Jo Woong Gyu?

823
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,280
They weren't good.

824
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,900
That is just a taste of what things
are going to be like in the future.

825
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,740
What?

826
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:18,190
We've transferred in the new student. Now
we have to take care of the troublemaker.

827
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:21,790
From now on, I won't tell you

828
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:27,630
to do this and do that anymore.

829
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,500
From now on, do whatever
you want, Assemblyman!

830
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,460
Me too. I also won't tell
you to drink anymore.

831
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,650
I must be crazy.<br>- What's
the point in saying that?

832
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,860
I am not some kind of
damn personal servant!

833
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,360
Absolutely not!

834
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,410
Ah, let's go quietly, please!

835
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:49,190
Why do I have to be quiet?

836
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:53,500
Because I'm an aide
are you dissing me?

837
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,890
I'm a woman who came
from the Blue House.

838
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:59,800
The Blue House!

839
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,450
Yes. Now please be quiet.

840
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,770
Let's go quickly.

841
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,400
This is your neighborhood.

842
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,350
What are you going to
do if other people see?

843
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:13,580
So what if they see? It's okay!
It's okay!

844
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,400
What's with you? You must
have really gone crazy.

845
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,820
People of the neighborhood, hello!<br>-
What are you doing? Hurry!

846
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:22,730
I'm Choi In Kyung.<br>-
Okay, enough!

847
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:26,030
This guy here!

848
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:31,400
This is the assemblymen I'm helping out.
Gookmin...

849
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,890
Hurry, let's go.

850
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:38,500
L-Let go of me.

851
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,360
You're so obnoxious.

852
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,960
What now?

853
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,110
The words that I
really want to say...

854
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:01,240
Can I say something without
caring about rank?

855
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,480
When have I cared about rank?

856
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,700
Go ahead. Do it. Do it.

857
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,720
Hey, Jin Sang Pil.<br>- I knew she would do
this. That she would drop honorifics.

858
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:17,320
You are to me
extraordinarily ugly,

859
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:21,820
obnoxious, ignorant and poor
out of everyone I've aided.

860
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,560
But

861
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,530
Jin Sang Pil, you!

862
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,610
Even so...

863
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:42,090
you're the best.

864
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,240
The best.

865
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,400
Jin Sang Pil... must leave the party.

866
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,320
Must.

867
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,650
Aide Choi, you're the best too.

868
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,740
The best.

869
