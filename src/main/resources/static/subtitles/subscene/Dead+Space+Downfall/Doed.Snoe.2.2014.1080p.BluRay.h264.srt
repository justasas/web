Martin, can you hear me?

40
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:45,167
Hello, Martin.
Welcome back.

41
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,500
Martin, you crashed your car.

42
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,667
A nasty crash.
You are lucky to be alive.

43
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,250
There is more than one can say
about your friends.

44
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,917
Have you seen

45
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,750
Have you seen creatures?

46
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,875
The things

47
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:16,042
Have the police caught them?
Or the army?

48
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,083
Roy and Erlend?

49
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,958
- Hanna?
- We found friends. All of them.

50
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,125
Dead.
Hanna was your girlfriend, right?

51
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,708
Very beautiful.
We found her too.

52
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,167
With an ax driven into the neck.

53
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,917
And your fingerprints on the shaft.

54
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,875
Do you have any idea
how that could happen?

55
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,708
They came up from

56
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:52,583
From the snow. Creatures. Nazi.
We stuck, but

57
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,250
Nazis coming out of the ground?
Absurd.

58
00:09:56,417 --> 00:10:01,042
Are you sure
that he has brain damage?

59
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:07,083
Please call the family and say he is awakened.
Ask the Attorney send a car.

60
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,542
And four additional men. You are
ready to be transported.

61
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:15,208
They are out there yet. They will kill
again if we do not stop them.

62
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:19,708
We should not stop anyone.
I've seen what you've done.

63
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:25,125
- You'll be right in jail.
- No one knows what happened there.

64
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,167
Only you know that.
And it's not just bad news.

65
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:34,833
When we found you, you were badly injured.
Your right arm was torn across.

66
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,167
- It was not torn
- When we found you, it was cold.

67
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,750
The snow had chilled all,
and it was very good.

68
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:46,917
- And then we found the arm in the car.
- In the car?

69
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:51,792
It was slightly bruised and quite pale,
bit strange, basically, -

70
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,333
- But the operation was a success.

71
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,542
We managed to stick your arm again.

72
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,875
No, no, no

73
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,875
- It's not my arm.
- Relax.

74
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:24,917
It is Satan's arm!
It is Satan's arm!

75
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,500
Calm down.

76
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,667
No, it's not me!

77
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,250
No!

78
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,625
It's not me!
What the hell ...?

79
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,292
Stop!

80
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,375
Randi?

81
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,375
You need to settle down
removing the denture later.

82
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,667
Tonight I'm ready for a little hue.

83
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,208
From him that got away.

84
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:44,458
Nameless GERMAN SOLDIERS
WHO FELL IN WAR

85
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,792
Bakken.

86
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,750
Warm.

87
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:45,208
The men have rotted.

88
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,875
We need more people.

89
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,000
Fittelås!

90
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,125
You scared me, Nils.

91
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,167
I can no more nonsense.
I have been a damn long day.

92
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:34,292
A wedding, a funeral
and confirmation.

93
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:38,125
She's one confirmant
was the damn fine, then.

94
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,833
If only I had been ten years younger -

95
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,042
- And not a priest, of course

96
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,208
Nils?

97
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,250
Come on!

98
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,292
Sieg

99
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,625
Heil.

100
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,917
Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil

101
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,667
They came down from the mountain.

102
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,625
I saw them.

103
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,417
Hello! Hello!

104
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,375
They are coming!
They're going to kill everyone!

105
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,583
Hey.
Hey, you there. Yeah, you.

106
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,542
Hello.

107
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,792
I saw your arm.
It is really tough.

108
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:58,542
I took pictures.
It's totally sick. But tough.

109
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:04,625
I can not really be here.
I snuck in like a ninja.

110
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,125
My name is Bobby.
I'm on vacation with mom.

111
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:14,292
She ate
something bad fish yesterday,

112
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,542
Tough.
Really tough.

113
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,000
It looks burnt out.
And old.

114
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:25,708
As a zombie arm.
Zombies are tough.

115
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
Zombies?

116
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:33,417
I must take it. They ask
I can provide more information.

117
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,667
More than just a picture of the arm.

118
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,083
Who? What?

119
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,000
Zombie Squad.
They want to know more.

120
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,667
They are zombie experts from the United States.

121
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,250
They have prepared themselves for
a zombie attack for years.

122
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:52,667
Can they get here?
Tell them to come here right away.

123
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,000
They can kill the zombies!

124
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,833
- Have you seen them? Fins they?
- Yes.

125
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,667
- Can you let me loose?
- I do not know if I should.

126
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,792
- I have chocolate.
- Have you?

127
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:15,208
Yes, I have chocolate.
I could brought it to you if

128
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:19,042
- Double-triple-nougat.
- Oh my God ...!

129
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,333
I'll take this.

130
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,500
Come on.
You can do it.

131
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,625
Help me with the other.

132
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,208
- Can I get chocolate now?
- I have not.

133
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,333
- No chocolate?
- Shut the fuck up.

134
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,000
I need out.

135
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,958
Hello!

136
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,458
That's not what it looks like.

137
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,625
Stop!

138
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:58,875
(a mobile rings)

139
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,833
Hello?

140
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,417
Daniel Heffernan, looking Zombie
Squad. Can I talk to Bobby?

141
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,667
Bobby. "

142
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:18,083
- <i> Bobby, he </ i>
- I do not speak the language of Tor.

143
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,625
- Is <i> Bobby </ i> there?
- Bobby was killed by zombies.

144
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:23,500
God

145
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:29,250
- Is this Zombie Squad?
- 10.4, Martin, and willow on the way.

146
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:34,542
But first we must have the most
information. All you have.

147
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,750
Well

148
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,208
We went up to the cabin,
and there was a bunch -

149
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,208
- Nazi zombies, and the

150
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:50,333
<i> Yes, they killed us all. </ i>

151
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,333
<i> Except me. And </ i>

152
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,125
I had to cut off my arm,
but

153
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,167
Now the arm

154
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,375
But then they would have left
his treasure, and

155
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:06,333
- <i> Were any </ i> of <i> you bite? </ I>
- <i> All was bitten. </ I>

156
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,125
But we were not one of them.
We just

157
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:16,042
We just died.

158
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:21,000
Listen, Martin.
Listen carefully.

159
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,792
It is not ordinary zombies -

160
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:29,500
- Hungry for human flesh.
These zombies are cursed.

161
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:32,583
<i> They will catch something
that was stolen from them. </ i>

162
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,417
- Or perform a mission.
- They called him Herzog.

163
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,917
They called him Herzog.

164
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,583
Martin from the North, we are on the way soon.

165
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,792
<i> and we'll take care of
this outbreak. </ i>

166
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:52,125
<i> We are professionals.
Meanwhile </ i> -

167
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:57,042
- So find out what they are looking for,
their goal. Cheers.

168
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,417
Zombie Squad.
they are

169
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,000
They are professionals.

170
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:13,708
<i> They are bad ass. </ i>

171
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,875
Okay, girls.

172
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,125
It appears
that we're going to Norway.

173
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:28,833
Norway? Not on your life.
It's the other side of the Earth.

174
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,917
And how do we know it's true?
Think about that is nonsense, Daniel?

175
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,958
You saw the picture.

176
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,292
There is a real infected arm.

177
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:44,583
All the signs are there.
Rotten skin and hair, dark blood.

178
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,500
- This is true.
- It could be dangerous.

179
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:51,917
There are zombies, damn,
Of course it is dangerous!

180
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:57,417
We have been waiting for a chance
to prove that we are right.

181
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:02,625
For years we have said that the only
was a matter of time -

182
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:06,958
-before the first outbreak occurs.
And what have we got an answer?

183
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,125
Laughter. Spott.

184
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,458
Panties case.

185
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,917
But who was right?

186
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:23,792
- Who laughs last?
- We, or?

187
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:28,625
Damn! Was it not therefore
we founded the Zombie Squad?

188
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,875
- He's right.
- Damn so right.

189
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:36,375
And if we do not go there
and helps them -

190
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,917
- Who should do it?

191
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,625
- What do we do then?
'Yes! '

192
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:48,667
We need to know as much as possible
Herzog about this guy.

193
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,500
And if Martin and Northern Norway. Everything.

194
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:55,167
Wait! Owners
must not find out about this.

195
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:58,292
- Do you mean father and mother?
- Yes, but

196
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,708
- We just can not say it to them.
- Roger that.

197
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,042
official members
Zombie Squad USA

198
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,500
- Oh my God ...!
- Now we are looking.

199
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,333
It went better than usual.

200
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,208
I poured coffee.

201
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:54,792
- It is the cold.
- Because you're 40 minutes late.

202
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:59,167
I am in the winter.
The DST system -

203
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:03,708
- Is completely idiotic.
What do you have?

204
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,417
Not much. The boy at Petra
has shoplift again.

205
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:12,292
They should have done that in Iran.
Off with his hands. When he had learned.

206
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:16,000
And Ove dog has pooed
in Olsen's garden.

207
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,917
- Shoot him
- Olsen?

208
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,833
Not Olsen. Shoot the dog!

209
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,625
So we have lectures to school
about the harms of using marijuana.

210
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,250
<i> lame! </ i>

211
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:32,083
There was one thing, then.
From Øksfjord.

212
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:36,000
Øksfjord?
It is not our district.

213
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:40,708
Martin Hykkerud
escaped from the hospital yesterday.

214
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:45,625
Martin Hykkerud? He who killed
his friends on top of the mountain?

215
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes. He escaped yesterday and killed
a little boy and a policeman -

216
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,875
- By fling a Mercedes star
in the face at him.

217
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:57,750
- Kutta the Mercedes star?
- Yes.

218
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:01,833
- What Oslo?
- About Mercedes star?

219
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,167
About Hykkerud case!

220
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:08,542
We need additional people,
they get sent a team up.

221
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:11,250
Sent a team up?
Extra people?

222
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:14,917
How the hell do I get money
additional people from?

223
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:19,708
I do not even have money
new batteries for cars.

224
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,708
Okay. Right.

225
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,458
What?

226
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,917
Were we not agree
having a casual look here?

227
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,708
Continue.

228
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:48,833
<i> OMG I expected Hoth,
but this is much more Ender. </ i>

229
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,958
Do you just references
from Star Wars?

230
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:57,417
- Yes, what else? Star Trek?
- It is based at least in science.

231
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,333
- I've Mirror Martin.
- Where is he?

232
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,042
- Isnestoften.
- Nice. Come on!

233
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:07,542
Wait.
We have to do something first.

234
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:11,167
- Yes, I have to pee.
- No!

235
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:15,458
Arming us.
Where you really ruined it.

236
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:14,042
It would have been easier
if we could purchase weapons here.

237
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,208
What the hell is wrong with
this country?

238
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,292
MUSEUM
ANOTHER WORLD

239
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:07,125
Can I help you?

240
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:10,500
Too much coffee. Just go ahead, you.

241
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:13,417
Best for you if you continue.

242
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,583
This is a war museum, huh?

243
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,917
Yes.

244
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,792
Yes, and

245
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:42,667
Do you have any information
about the Germans?

246
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,417
Help!

247
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,833
Listen to me!

248
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:02,083
I do not have time for this.
They come, and we must stop them!

249
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,875
- I have two kittens at home!
- Shut up!

250
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,833
Just help me.
Please.

251
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,958
- Do you have information about Einsatz?
- Yes.

252
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:18,542
- Second floor.
- Second floor.

253
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,042
Where the hell are you?

254
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,542
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

255
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:47,458
Buddy with Hitler.

256
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:51,875
- Nice, huh?
- Do not touch the exhibit.

257
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,042
"Herzog became head of Einsatz in 1942.

258
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:01,167
He was sent to Northern Norway
to protect warships -

259
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,875
- The Germans
kept hidden in the fjords.

260
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:12,000
He was Øksfjord to inspect
ship Scharnolsht, then

261
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,750
Scharnholst.

262
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:21,167
When Tirpitz, the German
Navy's biggest warships, -

263
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:25,083
- Was attacked
by British bombers in Talvik -

264
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,417
- After Norwegian spies
had revealed the ship's position.

265
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:34,458
Humiliated by the attack on the Tirpitz
Hitler ordered Herzog -

266
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:40,625
-to kill the entire population
800 men and women in Flintstone. "

267
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:46,417
Was he
He was on his way?

268
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:52,792
He was on his way to Talvik the evening
they were slaughtered in Øksfjord?

269
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,875
On behalf of Hitler.

270
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:05,750
A mission that was never performed.
It is. Exactly what is it.

271
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,917
They will destroy Talvik.

272
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,667
where

273
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:22,083
Herzog was going from Øksfjord -

274
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,458
- Which is here.

275
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,667
And he was going to Flintstone.

276
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,208
It's here.

277
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,250
Where are we now?

278
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,917
Where are we now?!

279
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,875
Her.

280
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,833
Isnestoften.

281
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:49,250
It is the in between.

282
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,583
(screaming outside)

283
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,208
They are recruiting!

284
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,500
They make new soldiers.
Can they do it now? Fuck!

285
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,750
Okay, they come here.
They come here.

286
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:49,625
I will not die in a museum
with a guy in a green jogging suit.

287
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,417
Calm down.
You will die.

288
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,458
But relax.
Not today.

289
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,208
There!

290
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,917
Let
what this thing can do.

291
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,917
What kind of things?

292
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,792
What did you do?
You killed them only without

293
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:30,750
It's arm, man.

294
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:35,750
Before I could not control it,
but now makes it known what I think.

295
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:38,417
You're not even sweating.

296
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,167
Do not worry about it.

297
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:50,917
They build bigger.
Damn much larger.

298
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:54,000
There are too many
through the arm.

299
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,250
So much death.

300
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:27,417
All this unnecessary death.

301
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,917
(whimpering)

302
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,083
Fuck!

303
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,083
You did what he fucker
in the place. You just

304
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,500
- You
- No, it was the arm. It was the arm.

305
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,875
He does not attack

306
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,583
Did you see it?
I hit it!

307
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,042
I hit it!
I did it fuck me!

308
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,875
I hit it right in the eye.

309
00:44:57,042 --> 00:45:00,542
Capture.

310
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:03,750
- First Zombie Squad murder.
- One, two

311
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:05,875
Orange ...!

312
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:08,875
Did you know?

313
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:13,833
We talked on the phone.
Daniel Blake and Monica.

314
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,500
We are Zombie Squad.

315
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:22,167
- Damn it
- It's true, people died.

316
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:25,167
And it was a real zombie.
You killed him.

317
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:29,083
- It is absolutely unimaginable.
- Conc bit here now.

318
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,458
We're sorry.
We are more professional than this.

319
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:36,625
- Are you Zombie Squad?
- Yep.

320
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:39,208
- You are the Zombie Squad.
- Yes, we are.

321
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:43,417
We're sorry.
I just expected something else.

322
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:47,792
He did well,
when he woke up this morning.

323
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:52,500
Because I hit him in the face
with an ax.

324
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,083
- How did you find me?
- We Mirror Your iPhone, of course.

325
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,833
We're fucking nerds.
Technology is our thing. Enough small talk.

326
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,208
What have you found?
What are they looking for?

327
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,375
Revenge.

328
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:14,125
(engine noise)

329
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,958
It's insane!

330
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,292
You? Have Capability?

331
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:23,292
The force is strong with him.

332
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:25,167
Fine, it

333
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:33,583
Martin,
that's how we defeat them.

334
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,125
- What do you mean?
- I mean

335
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,708
We create an army we.

336
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,708
I gathered as much information
as possible on the way here.

337
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:48,542
Especially if Herzog. To defeat
enemy, you must know him.

338
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:52,083
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
from the Soviet army.

339
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,750
Him and his battalion
was captured at Kursk.

340
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:58,750
They were brought here a prisoner of war.

341
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,417
In 1944 they were sent
to Kvenangsfjellet -

342
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:05,000
-to build a road.

343
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:10,000
When the road was completed,
shit was real hell.

344
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:15,625
All the prisoners were shot.
Shot to death!

345
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,625
None survived.

346
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:22,250
And the man who directed this?

347
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:24,167
Herzog.

348
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,667
Their bodies are buried there yet.

349
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:33,500
Buried in the frozen ground.
Preserved. They are waiting.

350
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:40,208
- What are they waiting for?
- The same as Herzog.

351
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:44,875
Revenge. And guess who
to help them with that.

352
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,917
- He who can raise the dead?
- Hell, yeah ...!

353
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:55,875
You must slow down Herzog,
and give me the most possible time.

354
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:58,750
- And if it does not work?
- It must.

355
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:02,250
We just have to find Stavarin,
wake him from the dead -

356
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:05,875
- And take him to Talvik
so he can fight against Herzog.

357
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:09,333
Lett. Besides

358
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:13,708
we help.

359
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:21,000
Then we go.

360
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,167
He is our last hope.

361
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,625
See, a tank.

362
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:07,667
(a sound from outside)

363
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:11,500
- Visit now?
- It was early.

364
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:28,000
(sound)

365
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,875
Hello?

366
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,875
(baby crying)

367
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,708
Look.
His army grows.

368
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:46,250
Are there more places
before going Flintstone?

369
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:51,208
- Only a few houses.
- Good. When he uses the ones he has now.

370
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:55,833
Mostly. Before he kills
residents of Talvik, and take them.

371
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,250
- How many live there?
- Approximately 3000.

372
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:03,375
- Holy Father!
- We need to slow them as much as we can.

373
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:10,292
- See there. Can you run one of these?
- Oh yeah. But I'm from Northern Norway.

374
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:14,000
I do not know what does.
Lightweight bags, folks.

375
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:16,708
We're leaving. Now!

376
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:25,958
What the deepest hell
happened here?

377
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:28,875
What do engineers?

378
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:32,833
It is not technical,
Only Tom and Ole in a white coat.

379
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,333
The thought
so a little more professionally out.

380
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:40,500
NCIS should be herein night.

381
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:45,208
- Do we have any witnesses?
- If you get the seagulls to chatting happily.

382
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,833
Gulls, yes.
Then you have a damn good invention.

383
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
A gadget that translates
seagull language to human language.

384
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:56,417
He who finds a way
are fucking rich.

385
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:59,833
Get the bodies of Talvik
before the gulls eat them up.

386
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,125
And take the damn many pictures, otherwise
NCIS cut off my balls.

387
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:09,083
Here are pictures
from the surveillance camera.

388
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,625
Is not that where ...?

389
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:22,333
To me at the head of guttefitta mi.

390
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:30,458
Okay, guys, guys!
We are in a hurry. Come on!

391
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,250
Come on, man!
We have things to do!

392
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,875
There they are.
And they have a tank.

393
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:41,833
Yes, they stole it from the museum.

394
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,417
Fuck!

395
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:50,208
- What is it?
- A huge tank and 40-50 zombies.

396
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:53,125
No, no, no.
There there. What is it?

397
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:57,958
A copy of binoculars
Han and Chewie used on Hoth.

398
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:02,208
Did you Nice to know.
All Hoth scenes -

399
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:06,500
- Was filmed here in Norway.
At a place called Finse.

400
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:11,708
Could we instead focus a bit
on Nazi zombies?

401
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:16,375
- What do we do?
- The Daniel said Sinke them.

402
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:18,333
Look.

403
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:23,708
We must let them see us,
and lure them out into the marsh.

404
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:29,167
And when they're stuck, blow
we them with fertilizer bombs ours.

405
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,583
It sounds really impossible.

406
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,500
And how do we lure them out there?
We need bait. Live bait.

407
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:39,125
We need
someone proves them.

408
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:42,125
One who is quick on their feet.

409
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:47,042
One who knows the marsh
and do not get stuck.

410
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:54,917
What?

411
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,792
No.

412
00:54:56,958 --> 00:55:00,000
No.
I do not go out into the marsh.

413
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:04,042
I also stuck.
The things there -

414
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:07,333
- They are zombies
who will rip off my face!

415
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,458
Is not Talvik hometown?

416
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:14,208
- Yes.
- You must love somebody.

417
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:19,125
Yes. There is a particular ma ...
A woman I love.

418
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:25,208
- With long hair and big boobs.
- Do it for "her".

419
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:29,708
Just run them here,
we'll do the rest. Understood?

420
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:41,625
You? Martin?

421
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:45,083
- Yes?
- Are you okay?

422
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,000
Sure.

423
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,958
First, we awaken
one battalion of Nazi zombies -

424
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:56,208
- And now I'm resurrecting
a bunch of dead Russians.

425
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:59,208
Your arm, your power, -

426
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:03,417
- The only thing that can
stop Herzog. Remember that.

427
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,667
Our failure -

428
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:10,625
- He will get more and more power,
for no one can stop him more.

429
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,292
And that, my friend,
is a huge tub of shit

430
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:19,375
- We will live in.

431
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,167
God.
It smells disgusting.

432
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,208
How can stink
fill the car already?

433
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:40,250
- He's just a little carsick.
- It smells awful.

434
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:42,167
No!

435
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,125
Damn, so disgusting!

436
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,042
It stinks.

437
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:38,458
I did not know it was
ugly-nosed congress in the city.

438
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,833
Come and get me, then.

439
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,917
Come and get me if you dare.

440
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:11,417
Move it!

441
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:17,792
Held!

442
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,458
- They follow him.
- Not Herzog men.

443
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:29,667
Now they have seen us.
We kill these here, he will take us.

444
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,667
Come on, Glenn!

445
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:40,875
- Run faster!
- Faster!

446
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:03,833
Yes!

447
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:13,125
Come on, Glenn!

448
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,042
Yes, rush

449
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,875
- Run, Glenn!
- Faster!

450
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,750
Run, run!

451
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,333
Please

452
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,542
Yes!

453
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:48,458
OMG, Blake!

454
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:52,500
USA, USA!

455
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,708
USA!

456
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:58,958
Shoot.

457
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,458
Hey. The tank moves.

458
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,500
It bodes well not good.

459
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,625
Run!

460
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,042
Run!

461
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:49,625
My God!

462
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,542
Talvik. Now.

463
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,333
Hey.

464
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,458
- Where are we?
- We are approaching.

465
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,833
But we're stuck.

466
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:27,250
- Can I push?
- I do not think it helps.

467
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:31,875
- Is it far? We can go.
- We do not have much time.

468
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,000
If only we could find something -

469
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:41,167
- We can lay under the car
so we get better traction.

470
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:44,083
Then I could have got us loose.

471
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,917
(whimpering scared)

472
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,042
- There you are, yes.
- Satan lives to accommodate all equal.

473
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:42,917
The dress is absolutely stuffed full.
We had to throw the rest in the garage.

474
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:46,583
- Sounds like a perfect solution.
- Thank you.

475
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:52,708
Most Germans and French.
Hardly the vacation they envisioned.

476
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:56,542
To get worn off his head and arms
and get entrails torn out?

477
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,417
Unless they like that kind of kinky stuff.

478
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:07,667
- Should you do that?
- No.

479
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:10,917
- Should not NCIS been here now?
- It gave a lot in Alta.

480
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:15,208
The plane could not land.
They are here in the morning, they say.

481
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:21,250
- It's perfect.
- What?

482
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,167
It's our chance.

483
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:29,125
Now, we fucking show people
what we're made of here.

484
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:34,000
We here at Talvik Police
find Martin Hykkerud itself.

485
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:38,375
We get him. Vi.
We will be heroes.

486
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,500
Not the goddamn suit-clad,
homofriserte -

487
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:46,083
- Sushi-eating hestkukene south.

488
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:49,208
Beef boys

489
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:54,542
Brief guys. Send photos to
all gossips throughout Talvik.

490
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:59,417
He stops to pee, I
Knowing the color and smell of urine.

491
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:03,583
- Odor and color.
- And make ready their weapons.

492
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,250
Now we shoot anything other than gulls,
for once.

493
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:15,000
Do you really
all this work?

494
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:20,000
I mean,
seen again, we have raised the Russians.

495
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:23,000
What we prevent them
to kill us?

496
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:29,000
I do not know what happens.
But for him to judge -

497
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:33,083
- You are his master.
I hope I will be yours.

498
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,208
Hopefully.

499
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:39,333
I do not know.
It has never happened accordingly -

500
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:44,542
- Mysterious voodoo zombie stuff.
I've never seen anything like this before.

501
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:50,042
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not going anywhere.

502
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:54,000
You have created a whole new genre here.

503
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:58,500
Do we have a battalion
Nazi zombies against us -

504
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:02,500
-there are worse things
than having some Russian zombies.

505
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:09,000
He must die. Herzog.

506
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:12,792
For what he did.
We must kill him.

507
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:18,333
I must kill him.
For Hanna.

508
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:24,833
- Here it is.
- Yes.

509
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,375
Yes, it's here.

510
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:35,042
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

511
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:39,875
So they must be buried
here in the frozen soil.

512
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,125
How do we do it?

513
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,042
In the same way -

514
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,958
- As with him.

515
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,792
I put my hand on his head.

516
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:55,542
Okay. Right.

517
01:06:57,417 --> 01:07:00,083
Digging up all takes several weeks.

518
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:04,500
You need to wake them,
a one way or another.

519
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:31,167
Lord.

520
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:39,042
Hell, yeah!

521
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,542
He was first seen here.

522
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,958
In Øksfjord.

523
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:24,792
And next time here.
Museum at lsnestoften.

524
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:29,375
So it looks as if
heading south. Perhaps there.

525
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,333
We have a problem.

526
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:38,167
A gang dressed as Germans
go bananas out there?

527
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:41,375
Bananas?
They killed loads of different people.

528
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:46,333
We have not had a murder since 74,
and suddenly there Ragnarok.

529
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:52,083
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shoot first, ask later!

530
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:40,833
There is no one here.
We have sent the the door.

531
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,208
They are gone.

532
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:48,708
Since you do not
can complete the mission, -

533
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:53,375
- You can just turn
and go back to your snow cave.

534
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:25,292
Some have grown a bit since last time.
Been a little bigger.

535
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:32,458
I also took a couple of buddies
the dance.

536
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:21,417
Is not it a bit sour
when someone you thought was dead -

537
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:24,458
- Coming back to kill you?

538
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:53,875
Let's kill them.

539
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:55,458
Troops!

540
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,250
Attack!

541
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,833
Let's kill them all!

542
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:21,958
What the hell is going on here?
Is the carnival in town?

543
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,667
Is there a tank?

544
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,417
- Damn!
- Run!

545
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,167
Help!

546
01:16:58,083 --> 01:17:00,542
Daniel! Idea.

547
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,375
- Should not we help them?
- Help who?

548
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:21,542
Those with blemishes in German uniform
or those with blemishes in Russian?

549
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:53,208
<i> okay </ i>

550
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,000
Good boy.

551
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:24,125
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!
- What the hell's going on?

552
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,542
Do as hell.
Looks like a video game.

553
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:30,167
Behold Martin Hykkerud!

554
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:33,583
- Yes!
- Should we take him?

555
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:37,083
No, no.
Wait until it calms down.

556
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,750
There are tactical policing.

557
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,417
Zombie Squad. It was time!

558
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,958
- It's a long story.
- There was a tank.

559
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:14,458
And one of them took my jacket.

560
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:19,625
- You found Stavarin.
- Yes, but they outnumber us yet.

561
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,625
We must make the fight more even.

562
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,250
Folks! We lose!

563
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,292
See!

564
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:16,042
Fuck!

565
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,083
No, no, no

566
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,333
No!

567
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,583
Wait!

568
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:43,583
We must kill him!

569
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:46,458
They are associated with him
Russians are to you.

570
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:49,708
If he dies, the other also.

571
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,458
We set a stop to this.

572
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,458
<i> Untermensch. </ i>

573
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:18,833
Honestly, guys.
No seat belts?

574
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,208
You ask for it.

575
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:53,958
How damn many more are they?

576
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,917
Is this the end?

577
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:06,542
Monica, it's like this ends?

578
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,417
No, no.

579
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,750
- Door we now?
- No.

580
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:16,250
Fuck it.

581
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,958
Now I say only.

582
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,083
I, -

583
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:26,042
- Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, is

584
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,708
No!

585
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,625
- Blake!
- Glenn?

586
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,292
Monica ..

587
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:44,917
Why did not you just
on the mountain?

588
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:54,542
You got's what you should have.
You got the gold. Tax.

589
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,917
But it was not enough.

590
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:06,833
You were greedy.

591
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,083
Would have more.

592
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,167
Blake

593
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,500
- Monica
- Beware!

594
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:22,292
- Monica!
- Blake!

595
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,625
Blake! No!

596
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:42,458
That's why you lost.

597
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:46,000
Because you were greedy.

598
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:54,500
You know you lost the war?

599
01:28:56,292 --> 01:28:58,917
Lost everything.

600
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,542
Joined ridiculed.

601
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:06,042
Pathetic.

602
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,917
And you know what?

603
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,583
You lose again.

604
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,375
No!

605
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,292
My God!

606
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,292
He did it!

607
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:48,583
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked. I knew it.

608
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:52,417
Herzog is dead.

609
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:54,833
He is dead. Yes!

610
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:13,083
It was damn close.

611
01:30:24,917 --> 01:30:28,333
You did it!
You killed Herzog?

612
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:32,750
I do not
that it actually worked.

613
01:30:32,917 --> 01:30:35,583
Of course it worked.

614
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,542
Doubted the Zombie Squad?

615
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:42,708
Kenneth Glenn, is he ...?

616
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:47,208
He did not.

617
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:02,375
It has been a true honor
killing zombies with you.

618
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,125
Likewise, Martin.

619
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,958
What is it? Okay.

620
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:17,833
- You can say it.
- Do it.

621
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:23,875
May the Force be with you.

622
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:31,375
Really? The?
Of all the ...? You chose it?

623
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:35,667
You have a million to choose from,
and then you take it?

624
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:03,125
- Where the hell are they?
- I know as hell.

625
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:07,042
Hell too! Bjarne!

626
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,250
Are you in a coma?

627
01:32:10,417 --> 01:32:12,792
Go and find them, dammit!

628
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:21,875
I would resolve this matter.
Do not end with a hundred new corpses.

629
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:27,083
Where do we fit it all?
The garage and the freezer is packed.

630
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,500
I do not know! I do not know.

631
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:41,625
The gulls again. They do not
eaten so well since the war.

632
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:47,250
We should have
the damn machine.

633
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:50,667
Whoever translator
seagull language to human language.

634
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:54,500
Then we would fuck me
Jack the matter as an egg.

635
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:57,542
As an egg.

636
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,875
(groan)
