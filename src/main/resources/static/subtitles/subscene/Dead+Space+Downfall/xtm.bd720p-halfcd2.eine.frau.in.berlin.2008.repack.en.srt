1
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,000
Anonyma

2
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:30,500
A Woman in Berlin

3
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,500
Who would've thought that?

4
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:43,292
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,875
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,792
and now they were heading
towards the Reichstag.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,250
On this day,
you could see the sun behind the clouds,

8
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:01,500
and the smell of lilac
wafted through all the smoke.

9
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,458
How to start?

10
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:11,625
How to find the right words?

11
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:17,042
I've been a journalist,
I've traveled 12 countries.

12
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,500
Been living in Moscow,
Paris and London.

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,958
I really liked to stay
in Paris and London.

14
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:28,458
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.

15
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,833
My name doesn't matter.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,125
I am one of the many who fervently
believed in our country's future.

17
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,000
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.

18
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,583
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.

19
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,167
The Russians don't have a leader.

20
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,250
When they finally come to their senses,

21
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,958
we are already knocking at
their front door in Moscow.

22
00:01:56,292 --> 00:02:00,333
Pardon our pushiness,
but it's war after all.

23
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,042
Gerd hated railway stations.

24
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:05,042
When he left, the sound of
his boots filled the house.

25
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,542
We were certain to do the right thing,

26
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,708
we breathed the same
air as everybody else.

27
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,500
We were part of this.

28
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:15,708
And then he takes off my coat and says:

29
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,583
The Russians have no idea
what's coming towards them.

30
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,250
So we were heading towards the
Sorbonne and chatting away in French.

31
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:28,417
He thought that I was one
of those tall blond Swedes.

32
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:32,583
Then I made a double step
to match my stride to his.

33
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,833
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"

34
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:41,375
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.

35
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:46,500
Hold on. I... I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.

36
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:54,042
I would like for us all
to share this moment,

37
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,875
this wonderful evening,
with our husbands

38
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:02,083
who are stationed
somewhere all over Europe.

39
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,917
Get lost!

40
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,875
Run, run!

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,417
Get away!

42
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,375
Go away!
Houses on the right. Fan out.

43
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,792
Come here, damn it!

44
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,875
Mummy, where are you?

45
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:51,333
Come on. Hurry.

46
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,750
Away. Go away.

47
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,917
Open fire, reload grenade.

48
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,958
...and fire!

49
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:34,917
Fire!

50
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,417
Shit.

51
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:43,875
- Wait for me.
- Watch out! Heads down.

52
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:47,958
- There you are.
- Stop! Wait for me.

53
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,125
Watch out!

54
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,542
No!

55
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:04,292
No uniforms, no weapons,
or it's martial law.

56
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,708
Felix, where are you?

57
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:16,833
Felix?

58
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:22,125
- Where the hell is he? Felix?
- Not a single order.

59
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:26,458
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.

60
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:31,042
Felix? Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?

61
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,500
In Wedding district, they are already
showing their toddlers to the Russians.

62
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:36,875
Russian pigs.

63
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:41,333
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.

64
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:46,917
And that's the pharmacist's widow.

65
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:52,042
Her husband once cured Minister
Hindenburg's headache.

66
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,083
That's over.

67
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:57,042
Now you step on the face
and the arms of a dead woman

68
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,583
only to get a glass of jelly.

69
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:08,750
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician. Her husband is MIA.

70
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,708
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Look at me. Look at me!

72
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,417
I will write all of this down,
I will report it.

73
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,625
Gerd, and you shall read it.

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,917
May I offer you something?

75
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,083
Thank you.

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,042
From Silesia.
She won't make it.

77
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,792
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!

78
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:46,125
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.

79
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,708
They're coming.

80
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:12,917
Halt!

81
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:49,333
Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.

82
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:54,458
All fire arms have to be
turned in immediately.

83
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,875
This is the last warning.

84
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,958
Attention, attention.

85
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,208
This is the last warning.

86
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,625
Attack!

87
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,208
Upstairs!

88
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,750
All the way upstairs!

89
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,000
Go away! Not now!

90
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,167
Attention!

91
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,875
I... I have...

92
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,500
Careful!

93
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,042
Comrade Colonel.

94
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,500
The troops have almost
reached Potsdam station.

95
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,125
But the order was to go towards
the government district!

96
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,833
Understood,
Comrade Colonel.

97
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:53,958
We'll stay here.

98
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,042
Major! I thought we were
going to the Reichstag.

99
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,250
No Reichstag? But why not,
we are so close.

100
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,458
Screw it,
we are not staying here!

101
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,792
That's an order!

102
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,000
Retreat!
Secure our flank!

103
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,208
Understood?

104
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,458
Soldiers?
Officers?

105
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,625
Weapons?

106
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:25,292
I said: Soldiers?
Officers?

107
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,000
They will see soon enough.

108
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,250
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.

109
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,792
Get out!
One person at a time.

110
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,625
Get out, all of you!
Move it!

111
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,958
- Russian filth!
- Up!

112
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,083
What... do you want?

113
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:09,875
Russian?

114
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,792
Yes.

115
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,792
Russian!

116
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,167
Come.

117
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:23,625
Come.

118
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,167
Eat.

119
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,542
War kaput.

120
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:33,500
Woman.

121
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:36,333
Come! Eat.

122
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,042
War kaput, woman.

123
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,167
Come on.

124
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,500
No fear.

125
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,708
No fear.

126
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:59,375
We will not die here.

127
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,167
Bravo, come, come.

128
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:25,583
Don't be afraid.

129
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,833
Come.

130
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,625
Don't shiver!

131
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,958
Good! Come.

132
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.

133
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,750
You be nice and you'll
get something to eat.

134
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,417
Potatoes. Very good.

135
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,917
May I?

136
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,500
Does anybody know
how this thing works?

137
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,500
You, Ukrainian,
do you know it?

138
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:18,208
There they are,
our Russian liberators.

139
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,292
Full of joy.

140
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:25,208
It seems they can hardly believe
that they've made it this far.

141
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,917
I know them,
their sandals and villages.

142
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:31,458
Their rapidly constructed new
buildings they are so proud of.

143
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,000
Stop!

144
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:36,000
They are without any constraints.

145
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,125
Don't move,
asshole!

146
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,375
Leave her.

147
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,042
Get lost.

148
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,500
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?

149
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,708
That's enough!

150
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,958
No, seriously...

151
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,292
Your urine is much too old.

152
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:11,042
Back in Leningrad, I put my general
back on his feet with urine...

153
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,375
You storyteller!

154
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,458
It's true.

155
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,583
What are they doing?

156
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,417
Please!

157
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,333
Please!

158
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,125
Have you husband?

159
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,458
A husband and two children.

160
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,542
Come anyway.

161
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:51,000
Quick, quick!
Let me through! Let me through!

162
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,667
No, no, you pigs.

163
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,667
You pigs! No!

164
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:06,000
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

165
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,125
Stop.

166
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,833
You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
Come on, don't be so prude.

167
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:15,000
Most fellow countrymen adeptly
saved their own hides.

168
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,750
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.

169
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,250
Leave!

170
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,708
Mrs. Hitler.

171
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:29,375
You slut! Where to?

172
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,083
To the Fuhrer?

173
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:38,333
Here. Quick.
Penthouse to the right. Quick! Go!

174
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,000
Take this and go! Go!

175
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,333
Come.

176
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:53,833
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.

177
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,250
Soldier!

178
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,500
Why are you taking a woman...

179
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,583
who doesn't want you?

180
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,708
Willing women are unclean.

181
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,750
Open the door! Open it!

182
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,917
Open the door,
you bastards! Open it!

183
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,375
Not here.

184
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,333
- Where?
- Almost there.

185
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,250
Stop! Stay where you are!

186
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,750
Hey you.

187
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,292
Shoo shoo!

188
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,417
Commander...

189
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,500
I am looking for
the commanding officer.

190
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,333
What's up?

191
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:25,458
Are you in charge here?

192
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,708
I... we need help.

193
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,375
Are you in charge here?

194
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:41,958
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.

195
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:44,667
Which one do you want?

196
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,667
Major, sir...

197
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,000
We need your help...

198
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,167
Our men are all healthy and clean.

199
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,542
Mrs. Hitler.

200
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,292
Our country is finished.

201
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:35,083
Gerd, do you remember your first words?

202
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,750
"Give me 30 minutes and you will
never want to leave me again."

203
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,708
God almighty.

204
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:51,083
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.

205
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,500
She took me by the hand and just led me
inside her undestroyed apartment.

206
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:05,583
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.

207
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,042
Moving places was easy: a blouse,
a few books and notebooks.

208
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:16,583
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.

209
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,167
Take good care of yourself.

210
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:41,333
In spite of everything, it would have
been good to have a closer look around.

211
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:47,250
But then, we never know everything,
so that's how the story continued.

212
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,667
I guess it has been
really nice here once.

213
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:11,292
How did you find me here?

214
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,875
I searched every cellar.

215
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,208
How often?

216
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,042
Often.

217
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,542
The shores are clad in green,

218
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,167
the trees are breathing
freely and deeply

219
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,542
We bravely stride on and on,

220
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,000
towards the final assault
in this war!

221
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:00,875
Our path was long to reach
this day in May.

222
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,500
It has cost us much
strength and courage.

223
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,042
But now we are free again!

224
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,208
We proudly take our positions.

225
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:11,542
Greetings, May.

226
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,250
Our soldiers and a few American weapons,
and those would be history.

227
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:18,625
Yeah.

228
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:34,583
Yesterday at the water pump,
it was my turn,

229
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:35,875
a guy approaches me,

230
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:41,917
two Iron Crosses and one German
Cross in Gold on his chest,

231
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:46,167
and he gallantly takes the buckets
out of my hands. And I say:

232
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:52,542
"How do I deserve this honor?"
and he says "We can't give up now"

233
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:56,917
"because if the Russian
even remotely does to us

234
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:01,083
"what we did to them
during the last four years,

235
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,542
"in the near future there won't
be any living Germans left."

236
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:11,958
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.

237
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:24,792
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin! We made it!

238
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:42,750
How do you say: Excuse me,
do you have a dictionary?

239
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:48,000
I guess he doesn't need a
dictionary for what he wants.

240
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,250
Lenchen!

241
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,125
Come with us!

242
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,792
Come where?

243
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,125
Lenchen!

244
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:27,208
During the next few days,
our house was raided day and night.

245
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,167
Lenchen!

246
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:34,042
One woman hanged herself,
another one was shot to death.

247
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:36,417
None of us was spared.

248
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:39,625
Every emotion is dead.

249
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,167
Hey, you from Berlin!

250
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:43,667
Over here! Upstairs.
What kept you so long?

251
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,917
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.

252
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,792
Forever!

253
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,875
Lenchen.

254
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,375
- What have you got there?
- A map.

255
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,917
Move it! Faster.

256
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,792
You go left,
I go right.

257
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,208
Where are you going?
Come to us.

258
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,875
Come.

259
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:32,417
Wake up, damned of the earth,
who are living in hunger and misery.

260
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:36,875
Justice is about to burst through
like glowing magma in a volcano.

261
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:58,167
You just go away, away!

262
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,083
I!

263
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,250
I...

264
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,042
...love...

265
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,667
...you.

266
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,750
Good day.

267
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,333
Please, don't!

268
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,917
My pretty one.
I'll be back.

269
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,458
My pretty one...

270
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:30,167
I am a young man...

271
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,542
You scared me.

272
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,500
We will survive all this,

273
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,125
by any means necessary.

274
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,083
Where to?

275
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,458
We're here.

276
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,375
Who are you looking for?

277
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:24,375
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.

278
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:32,417
So where are they now,
our saviors, all the great armies?

279
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:36,958
In the past, war and dying
was a male exclusive thing.

280
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,083
But those times are long gone.

281
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:43,875
Damned Russians. Officer, General,
Commander, doesn't matter.

282
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,083
I take everyone,
as high in rank as possible.

283
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:50,375
From now on,
I will decide who gets me.

284
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:57,333
No, no. Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.

285
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:02,083
You can protect us from over there
on the couch, see? Protect.

286
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:06,208
Hm? See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.

287
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,625
Do you understand?

288
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,417
Where is the Major?

289
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,167
Wait.

290
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,375
Hey, Miss.

291
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:00,125
Who are you looking for?

292
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,667
You, blondie.

293
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,042
Why are you looking so stern?

294
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,500
You!

295
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:18,792
Could you soap my back, huh?

296
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,958
Who do you want to talk to?

297
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,875
You.

298
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,000
Dismissed.

299
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,833
May I have a seat?

300
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:23,667
No.

301
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:45,167
Yesterday our house has been occupied
and many women have been raped.

302
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,875
I know nothing of that.

303
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:58,958
It is your duty to help us.

304
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:09,833
Who?

305
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,458
My people...

306
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,333
...or yours?

307
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:19,500
Me.

308
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:34,792
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.

309
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:49,542
It's pointless.

310
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,000
You Russian? Looking what?

311
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,083
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?

312
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:06,000
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.

313
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,125
Lieutenant, sir.

314
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,667
May I have a word?

315
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:15,250
Some of the balconies in
our house are mined.

316
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:18,500
Could you help?

317
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,333
Pity.

318
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,958
Miss!

319
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,792
You, I, evening?

320
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,125
Hm?

321
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:54,333
I Anatol.

322
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:58,417
You, I, simple as that, huh?

323
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:03,917
At this moment I made a vow,

324
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:08,792
that nothing and nobody would
touch me, no matter what happened.

325
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,250
Come in.
Follow.

326
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,042
That's where I live.

327
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,292
Come on in.

328
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:24,500
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.

329
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:30,833
Well...

330
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,875
That's my husband.

331
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:39,292
Don't you understand?

332
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:42,792
My husband.

333
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,625
You must understand that.

334
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,250
All humans are bad.

335
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:58,417
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.

336
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,917
What are doing?
That is mahogany.

337
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,167
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.

338
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:17,333
To the 215th Rifles!

339
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,375
To victory!

340
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:22,833
To us.

341
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,125
I Charkov!

342
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,625
He's from Charkov.

343
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:33,667
Charkov! Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.

344
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:35,917
An accountant?
You're kidding me.

345
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:40,167
I accountant! You accountant!
We accountant!

346
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:45,708
Everything fine.

347
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:48,292
That's life, you see?

348
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:49,708
You, pretty.

349
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:54,583
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.

350
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:58,667
The fucking war is really
pissing me off.

351
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,458
True.

352
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,833
When I get back to Charkov,

353
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:05,167
I'll marry, build a house,

354
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,000
get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.

355
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,500
and you, I will
take you as my accountant.

356
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:12,625
Are you a professional soldier?

357
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:14,750
No...

358
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,958
I, dairy.

359
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:20,458
Milk! Milk. Cow.

360
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:28,875
- How very interesting.
- Interesting! Milk and milk.

361
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,917
That's bullshit.

362
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:34,750
Look at this.

363
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:37,250
My trophies.

364
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:39,875
That's nothing.

365
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,167
Here.

366
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,292
THAT is a trophy.

367
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:46,167
That's not a trophy.

368
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,417
Have a look at this.

369
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:49,958
That...

370
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:53,333
...that is a REAL trophy.

371
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,875
An original.

372
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,292
My present to all the ladies.

373
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:00,292
To kiss and marvel about.

374
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,625
Where toilet?

375
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,083
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.

376
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:37,208
Would you like something to eat?

377
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,042
You.

378
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,542
You fancy my dick?

379
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,542
Doesn't matter which one.

380
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,167
Dick is dick.

381
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,000
Why Russia?

382
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,125
What were you doing there,
you sons of a bitch?

383
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:39,833
Why Russia?

384
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:53,833
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.

385
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:07,792
He is battalion commander. They don't
have commandants, only commanders.

386
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:13,458
Did you know that they study
German as first foreign language?

387
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:18,708
Well, it needs a war for us to
get this bit of information.

388
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:21,792
Can I do something for you?

389
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:31,792
Hey Mongol. Have you come
all the way from Moscow

390
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:35,042
just to get some water
for a German woman?

391
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:38,417
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?

392
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Made in Germany...

393
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,458
I am taking care of the Major.

394
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,375
Go now.
I'll catch up later.

395
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:02,250
Go.

396
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,292
Go, Mongol, go!

397
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:09,708
Move it. Faster!
Go, go, go!

398
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,875
Move it already.
Faster.

399
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:23,792
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors
and the whole house was rubble.

400
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:29,583
And it blasted the fattened
sow up till under the roof.

401
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,208
Well, obviously it was spoiled.

402
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,208
Here.

403
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,083
Give it to me.

404
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,250
My apologies...

405
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,958
for my unsuitable behavior.

406
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:02,583
Dismissed.

407
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:29,583
Berlin is ours.

408
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,583
There.

409
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:47,292
I have told everybody
that they needed to go.

410
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:53,958
May I sit down?

411
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:04,583
Come here.

412
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:07,833
As you wish.

413
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:44,250
No?

414
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:14,917
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.

415
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:18,458
In every apartment.

416
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,917
We are Russian property now.
At their service.

417
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,125
But us women, we will need to
keep our mouths shut,

418
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:30,667
or no man will ever want to touch
us again when this is all over.

419
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:30,833
Poor Germany.

420
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:43,208
German fighters: sit!

421
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:25,333
Four. Four women.

422
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:29,250
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.

423
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,958
Here.
That's what I've found.

424
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,000
They've got everything.

425
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:40,125
They've got jewelry
and money and houses.

426
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,833
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.

427
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,375
Enough.

428
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:52,500
What do I care about them?

429
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:58,583
Sometimes I think that from now on
I could endure everything imaginable,

430
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,250
as long as it comes from the outside

431
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,500
and not from deep within
my treacherous heart.

432
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:12,583
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.

433
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,292
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.

434
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,500
A welcome committee.

435
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:52,917
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.

436
00:51:57,333 --> 00:52:00,250
Anatol is a gypsy.

437
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:05,083
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.

438
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,917
My sun.

439
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,583
Do you think...

440
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:27,625
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?

441
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,167
No. Never.

442
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,125
Here.

443
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:43,875
Is that all?

444
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,958
My head is aching like crazy.

445
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:11,750
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.

446
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:15,042
If that's the last thing
I'll do in my life.

447
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,708
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.

448
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:28,333
Fuck the Reichstag.

449
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,375
Then he grabs me
and throws me on the bed.

450
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:41,167
And suddenly, he gets so boring,
like a lapdog.

451
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:47,542
Later, he complimented me.

452
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:51,750
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this."

453
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,917
"You, like this."

454
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:05,708
He had really bad breath.

455
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:22,750
- Oh. It's you.
- Good morning. We bring breakfast.

456
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:27,583
The next morning, a few blocks
away the war was still raging,

457
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:31,833
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.

458
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:38,417
The widow, who loved bacon,
was busy as a bee.

459
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:44,542
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard,
was all too happy to surrender.

460
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:46,583
This way.

461
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,625
- Russian horse.
- What's that?

462
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,000
Sugar. We have sugar!

463
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,333
And bacon and salami
and bread and butter.

464
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,708
Great joy,
but not for everybody.

465
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:08,458
Then came the cavalry.

466
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:11,333
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead,
horses snuffling.

467
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:12,583
When a horse is charging,

468
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,500
that's an incredible force.

469
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,792
The whole avalanche is
charging against the tank,

470
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:22,250
against the artillery,
against all the machine guns -

471
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:24,667
All kaput.

472
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,583
You've had much more troops,

473
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,500
but they just couldn't stand it.

474
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:31,917
They dropped their weapons and fled.

475
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,000
German soldiers, bah!

476
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,417
Don't be so insensitive.

477
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,542
We didn't start this war!

478
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:40,125
Sit down.

479
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,833
And stop insulting our host.

480
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,500
Enough.

481
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,833
I Caucasus.

482
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,708
Caucasus, understand?

483
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:50,583
Big mountain, so beautiful!

484
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:54,083
Sun, blue sky.

485
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,833
Nice dancing with women.

486
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:02,125
As sweet as grapes.

487
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:05,625
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.

488
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:09,292
Pushkin? Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.

489
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,833
Go home, understand?

490
00:56:12,667 --> 00:56:14,875
I want to see my children
and my wife.

491
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:32,792
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin."

492
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,625
I want my wife.

493
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:40,708
My wife. Understand?

494
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:48,292
What do you know about fascism?

495
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,792
Fascism?

496
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:02,333
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a
"bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.

497
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:06,750
To our host.

498
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:07,833
Right.

499
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:10,208
To a woman who is
quite obviously very bright.

500
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:13,083
Just like you right now.
Very bright.

501
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:15,583
But I am not a woman!

502
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,875
To German-Russian friendship!

503
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,625
Hurray!

504
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,708
Everybody upstairs, quick!

505
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:30,625
Hurry! Quick!

506
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:37,375
Search all the apartments.

507
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,458
Out. Out!

508
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,917
You goddamn bastard!
You dick! You fucking dick!

509
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,917
Stop it.

510
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,125
Enough!

511
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:10,750
You know Stalin's orders.

512
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,167
Get lost.

513
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:15,042
Really? What if I don't?

514
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,250
Are you gonna shoot me?

515
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:23,167
I'll kill you if I have to.

516
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:29,292
He is acting on my orders.

517
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:31,458
Stop!

518
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:34,417
A young soldier has stolen food.

519
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:37,250
He is armed.

520
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,625
Who is living up there?

521
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:46,917
Who is living there?

522
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:53,250
Anybody living there?

523
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:56,000
No.

524
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:58,542
She's lying.

525
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,542
Lying bitch.

526
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:02,917
I spit on Germany.

527
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,750
And on Berlin.

528
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,292
We conquered it,
and I spit on it!

529
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:12,833
Get out of my way.

530
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:39,000
Don't move.

531
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:52,500
I'll kill you, punk!

532
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:11,208
Everyone in possession of fire
arms or hiding someone with guns

533
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:15,625
will be executed immediately,
their houses destroyed.

534
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,042
They will not forget this.

535
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:55,833
Can I have something to drink?

536
01:01:57,042 --> 01:01:59,417
You need to get away from here.

537
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:20,708
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.

538
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,500
During the next few days,
the Major was here often.

539
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,417
Great protection for everyone.

540
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:13,208
In his coat he had tucked away candles
and cigars and plenty of gifts

541
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:17,833
that the widow stashed away in her
kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.

542
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,042
On the whole,
the times were changing.

543
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:33,917
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?

544
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:37,458
That is way too much.

545
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:46,250
The major speaks sophisticated Russian
and told me more than I wanted to know.

546
01:04:46,833 --> 01:04:48,833
Now I know about his bank account,

547
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:51,750
his parents and the
names of his brothers.

548
01:04:51,917 --> 01:04:56,833
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.

549
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:02,708
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.

550
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:11,167
The war continued.

551
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:14,833
While our men and husbands
were sent to Siberia,

552
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:17,708
many of the women found protectors

553
01:05:17,792 --> 01:05:19,875
which made them a taboo
for the rest of the pack.

554
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,083
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.

555
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:26,583
Almost there.
Hold it up. Up.

556
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:33,042
In and out, in and out.

557
01:05:33,042 --> 01:05:35,667
It's like Grand Central Station in here.

558
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:40,333
Mussolini is dead. Hanged.

559
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:42,958
He deserved it.
One asshole less.

560
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:45,833
Cheers!

561
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:05,458
As soon as Andrej had left the house,
Anatol claimed his visiting rights.

562
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:11,667
I was afraid that the two top dogs
would meet and kill me one day.

563
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:22,667
It's not that I could claim
that this Major is raping me.

564
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:25,750
I am at his service.

565
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:28,750
A whore? Maybe.

566
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,833
I have met that kind of
woman only once in my life.

567
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
People told me not to talk to
her because she was unsound.

568
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:42,292
Whatever that means: unsound.

569
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:45,917
Young woman!

570
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,500
No way.

571
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:59,667
Incredible.

572
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,167
There she comes prancing
along as if nothing happened.

573
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:12,542
- How often?
- Four times. You?

574
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:18,542
Come on.

575
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:23,875
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.

576
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:24,958
So do you.

577
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:27,875
Here. Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux. Take it.

578
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,208
You take that with you.

579
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:32,208
Seems you are having
a good life here.

580
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:34,792
That's one way to put it.
Come on.

581
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:39,042
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

582
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:41,792
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.

583
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:43,917
The Major is guarding us well

584
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,458
so that we can drink his tea
without any disturbances.

585
01:07:46,542 --> 01:07:47,708
That feels so good.

586
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:49,333
Where to?

587
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:51,583
What do you care?

588
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:53,083
You can't go in there.

589
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:54,958
Who's in there?

590
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:02,625
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.

591
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:04,375
So I tell him:"Young man,

592
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:09,167
"that gun there over your shoulder,
that might go off."

593
01:08:10,292 --> 01:08:13,208
And when I go up the stairs,

594
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:17,292
on the second floor someone
rushes out of the apartment,

595
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:20,333
grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"

596
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:22,292
And I am in shock and I say:

597
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:26,042
- "No, surely not."
- How dumb of you.

598
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:33,042
How's your husband?

599
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:34,792
He was there when it
happened the first time.

600
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:36,083
He's been a bit confused ever since.

601
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:40,208
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.

602
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:42,750
They are pretty unimaginative.

603
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:44,375
It may be that at home,

604
01:08:44,542 --> 01:08:48,458
they have the latest and greatest
socialist planned economy,

605
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:51,750
...but their sex life
is that of Adam and Eve.

606
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:54,042
That's what I told my husband, too.

607
01:08:54,958 --> 01:09:00,292
With all the food shortage,
a good husband isn't worth that much.

608
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:05,500
I guess a satisfactory sex
life depends on regular meals.

609
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:09,125
For me, it's all
about a full stomach.

610
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:10,708
No gifts, no sex!

611
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,542
Heart, Pain, Love,
Sex Drive. To us!

612
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:20,000
Who knows when we'll be
together again.

613
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,792
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!

614
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:26,875
That is apple streusel cake.

615
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,958
Yeah, with crumbles,
and it's still steaming hot.

616
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:35,417
# You, you are in my heart. #

617
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:39,083
# You, you are on my mind. #

618
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,750
# You, you cause me great pains, #

619
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:46,250
# you don't know how much I love you. #

620
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:48,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:53,167
# don't know how much I love you. #

622
01:09:57,417 --> 01:10:01,292
Not too much going on with our
Russian men right now, am I right?

623
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:06,667
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.

624
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:11,542
Have you heard anything from Gerd?

625
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,958
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.

626
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:16,875
Oh my God.

627
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:20,333
How do you know you've got it?

628
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:23,042
Itching and burning.

629
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:27,167
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.

630
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:31,625
I've read it in a lexicon.

631
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,292
A lexicon...

632
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:44,750
Here.

633
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,833
An American gave that to me.

634
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:50,833
Chew it.

635
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,917
Good, isn't it?

636
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:58,250
Americans...

637
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:03,167
They all look like film stars.

638
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:16,917
I'm leaving.

639
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,583
And tell her...

640
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:22,667
that I'll be back.

641
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:26,625
You got that?

642
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,792
What's that?

643
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,042
Can you protect us?

644
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:01,042
Just this one day?

645
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,833
I'll be here.

646
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:24,083
Where will you go...
later?

647
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:28,417
To where I am needed.

648
01:12:31,417 --> 01:12:34,375
A special evening with the Major.

649
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:36,875
Good conversation.

650
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:38,917
He told me that he adores me.

651
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:41,208
And that he doesn't care
about anything else.

652
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:47,208
Other than the Germans, the Russian
men really appreciate educated women.

653
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:53,708
But the war hasn't ended yet.

654
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,167
Excuse me.

655
01:12:55,167 --> 01:13:00,917
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.

656
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:08,667
Come on, kiddos,
let's get out of here.

657
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:10,917
We will finish building
this tower of yours.

658
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:18,958
That's him.

659
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:27,458
Good day.

660
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:32,083
You Russian?

661
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:35,375
Translate.

662
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:56,917
The German army came to my village

663
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:10,708
and killed all the children.

664
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:18,125
They have...

665
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,750
...stabbed them to death,

666
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:34,208
took their bodies at the ankles...

667
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,542
Continue!

668
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:45,667
...and smashed their skulls...

669
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,667
...on the walls...

670
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:13,500
...of the houses.

671
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:24,542
Have you heard that?

672
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,083
Or did you see it with your own eyes?

673
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,958
I saw it.

674
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,542
Hey! Why so fast?

675
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:48,542
Have you forgotten your panties?

676
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,083
You speak Russian,
so tell him he needs to stop that.

677
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:16,000
You speak Russian, right?

678
01:16:26,042 --> 01:16:30,375
Move it, you slut!
Go.

679
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:12,208
Where are you going?

680
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:16,750
I've been waiting for you.

681
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:23,500
What's wrong with you?

682
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:26,667
Comrade Major!

683
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:38,625
The old Germany is coming to an end.

684
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:48,333
Stay away from him!

685
01:17:48,792 --> 01:17:50,375
He is coming to me,

686
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,375
not the other way round.

687
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:55,125
Go away.

688
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:57,417
Why?

689
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:04,083
You Germans have hanged his wife.

690
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:33,583
Attention! On April 30th,
1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.

691
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:40,667
He deserted all of us who have
pledged allegiance to him.

692
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:46,000
Following the orders of the Fuhrer,
you still believe it's your duty

693
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:50,833
to defend Berlin although
the supply of heavy armory,

694
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:56,750
ammunition and your position make
this fight utterly pointless.

695
01:18:58,042 --> 01:19:00,208
With every hour you continue to fight,

696
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:05,708
you prolong the horrible suffering
of the civil population of Berlin...

697
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,500
and our wounded soldiers.

698
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,042
From now on, everybody who
dies in the battle for Berlin

699
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:15,000
will have sacrificed
their lives in vain.

700
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:20,833
In accordance with the leaders
of the Soviet army I prompt you

701
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:25,083
to cease all fighting immediately.

702
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:34,292
Breitling, Artillery General and
commanding officer of the Berlin defense.

703
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:50,667
Fellow soldiers and officers
of the 8th guard army.

704
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,458
This morning,

705
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:55,458
the Berlin garrison...

706
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:58,125
...has capitulated.

707
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:00,917
Berlin...

708
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:05,167
is defeated.

709
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,750
I've told you we would make it!

710
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:46,792
I'll join my fellow Germans.

711
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:50,417
Go to Siberia?

712
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
What about us?

713
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:15,458
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!

714
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:19,250
Talk to me.

715
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:24,583
I've been waiting for you.

716
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,417
I have prayed and hoped,

717
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:33,958
prayed and hoped.

718
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:38,000
No I want you to fulfill

719
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:43,542
some of those hopes for me.

720
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:26,167
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!

721
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,417
Berlin is defeated!

722
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:32,792
To our home country!

723
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:39,458
Long live the Red Army!

724
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:44,625
Long live Stalin!

725
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:15,125
Hold on, wait a second.

726
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:22,125
What have we here?
Two halibuts.

727
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:30,125
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.

728
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:35,542
That's great!
Let's drink.

729
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:37,042
Capitulation.

730
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:40,125
The time has come.

731
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:43,292
The war is over.

732
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:47,625
Us women have been looking
forward to this day so much.

733
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:47,750
So how does it feel?

734
01:25:47,917 --> 01:25:50,958
Bitter, bitter defeat.

735
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:58,458
More and more people report
gruesome things.

736
01:25:59,042 --> 01:26:03,750
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp
something in the air,

737
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:08,542
mean and threatening.

738
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,875
I don't want to think
about that right now.

739
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:22,917
It's over.

740
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:24,958
I don't know...

741
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:29,292
I'm afraid misfortune has still
some tricks up its sleeves.

742
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:46,208
Do you hear that?

743
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:49,625
They drink and smoke like men.

744
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:57,250
There are 1 million women
in the Russian army.

745
01:26:58,958 --> 01:27:03,083
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.

746
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:08,375
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.

747
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:14,125
Once a woman came to me,
Ljuba was her name I think.

748
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:19,083
She says: "Comrade Major,
I believe I will fall today.

749
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:24,625
"I want new clothes." I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.

750
01:27:24,792 --> 01:27:29,333
"Bullets just avoid you."
Two hours later, she comes again.

751
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:32,417
And again. Then I tell her:

752
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:39,333
"Then the new shirt,
with ties white as snow,

753
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:43,333
it would be spoiled by the blood."

754
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:49,833
All female soldiers fear that when
they die, they don't look pretty.

755
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:57,125
Are you a fascist?

756
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:09,542
What are you looking for?

757
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:11,500
All occupied.

758
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:21,708
And the battalion commander?

759
01:28:28,167 --> 01:28:30,750
That's what I like
about you Mongols.

760
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:36,000
Not a single unnecessary word.

761
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:45,250
1678 days...

762
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:48,167
since I've been in this war.

763
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:56,375
And now...

764
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:05,417
And she...

765
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,583
she's a whore.

766
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,625
Am I right?

767
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:14,500
This whole place...

768
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:17,292
is a brothel!

769
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:11,375
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.

770
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:17,125
A pistol, huh? Bastard!

771
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,458
Peace, huh?

772
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:19,833
Don't!

773
01:30:23,083 --> 01:30:25,125
War kaput!

774
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:31,125
I said, move it!

775
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:32,875
Everybody downstairs.

776
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:35,542
Hurry!

777
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:43,750
All of you, downstairs.

778
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:45,625
Hurry!

779
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:47,417
Faster.

780
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:50,083
Quick!

781
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,333
Don't move.

782
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:59,792
Where you get weapons?

783
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:08,542
Whose apartment is that?

784
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:13,833
Who?

785
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:16,333
It's mine.

786
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:27,292
Is that hers?

787
01:31:28,042 --> 01:31:29,417
It's hers.

788
01:31:30,292 --> 01:31:34,167
That is crime against
decree of Red Army.

789
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:37,250
Long live the Fuhrer.

790
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:39,833
Eliminate her.

791
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:43,417
You can all go to hell.

792
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:49,750
Did you know about weapons?

793
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:56,333
- No.
- Go back to apartment.

794
01:31:56,917 --> 01:31:58,042
Shoot them all!

795
01:31:58,375 --> 01:31:59,500
Go now.

796
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:00,583
Stop.

797
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:02,375
They're liars, all of them!

798
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,583
Shoot them.

799
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:08,375
Leave this woman.

800
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:09,792
She is a Hitler broad.

801
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:11,833
Do you understand?

802
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:12,167
No.

803
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:15,708
First she will be interrogated.

804
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:18,583
Do you understand?

805
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:20,125
What are you doing, brother?

806
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:24,042
This woman has sheltered
an armed soldier.

807
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:25,583
The punishment for that is death.

808
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:26,958
Go, now!

809
01:32:34,042 --> 01:32:36,917
I'll have to report this.

810
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:40,667
Burn them alive!

811
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:53,417
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.

812
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:23,583
Traitor!

813
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:43,583
I own whole Berlin! Hotel Adlon,
Wedding, Kaiserdamm!

814
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:46,917
Red flags everywhere.

815
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:50,542
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.

816
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:55,333
What is it?

817
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:00,375
Quarrel?

818
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:13,542
What are you looking at?

819
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,917
Get out of my sight.

820
01:34:20,417 --> 01:34:21,500
Hey, what's up?

821
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,625
To victory, Commander.

822
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:26,083
To Stalin and our victory.

823
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:28,042
Wait.
You should stay with your people.

824
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:30,333
The war is over.

825
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:34,500
Here! I get it.

826
01:34:35,292 --> 01:34:36,750
Look...

827
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:38,917
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.

828
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:42,750
They love me,

829
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,083
all of them.

830
01:34:46,417 --> 01:34:48,458
Everything all right?

831
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,042
Do you want something to eat?

832
01:35:05,292 --> 01:35:11,708
Here. What's better? You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?

833
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:14,958
And you, get out of here...

834
01:35:15,083 --> 01:35:16,875
before I shoot your nuts off!

835
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,083
You, listen!

836
01:35:20,542 --> 01:35:21,792
We celebrate.

837
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,208
Everybody come, whole house.

838
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:25,000
Order!

839
01:35:27,167 --> 01:35:31,542
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.

840
01:35:33,792 --> 01:35:34,917
Not human.

841
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:36,792
Turd!

842
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,750
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!

843
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,917
Everyone, come now.

844
01:35:44,042 --> 01:35:45,083
Order!

845
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:48,417
Fill the glasses.

846
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,292
What are you standing there?

847
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:52,042
We've got guests.

848
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:05,375
Why fear?

849
01:36:17,125 --> 01:36:20,417
Look down there.
What do you see?

850
01:36:22,917 --> 01:36:24,333
Soldiers.

851
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:29,667
Russians! Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.

852
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,875
And you're right.

853
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:39,333
None of us is hesitating a single
second if we can shoot a German.

854
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,875
Your blood is on our uniforms.

855
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:47,458
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!

856
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:52,792
Most of them didn't even
know what that is, Germany.

857
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,542
Now come with me.

858
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:06,167
What is happening here?

859
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:08,417
Careful, that's mahogany.

860
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:11,833
Let me go!

861
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:19,792
- You dance. Dance!
- How dare you?

862
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:23,333
This is my living room
and not a dance hall.

863
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:24,375
You understand?

864
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:27,625
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!

865
01:37:27,917 --> 01:37:31,625
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.

866
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:36,250
You.

867
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:48,375
Sing? Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.

868
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:53,208
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.

869
01:37:53,792 --> 01:37:54,792
No.

870
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,500
What does that mean, "no"?

871
01:37:58,917 --> 01:38:01,958
That is Europe!
That is Europe!

872
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:04,042
Drink, drink.

873
01:38:06,042 --> 01:38:07,125
Why not?

874
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:09,292
I'm looking at you.

875
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:11,500
And you?
Nothing.

876
01:38:17,917 --> 01:38:19,500
Well, maybe next time.

877
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:21,667
To you.

878
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:39,417
I Anatol.

879
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:44,125
- I know.
- Brbel.

880
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:49,958
My heart calls Brbel.

881
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:54,458
Brbel, Brbel, Brbel.

882
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:09,042
I play the fiddle.

883
01:39:09,167 --> 01:39:11,292
Violin. Violin?

884
01:39:11,958 --> 01:39:13,625
You play the piano?

885
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:16,042
In an orchestra,
but not any more.

886
01:39:16,042 --> 01:39:17,333
The violin is lost.

887
01:39:17,917 --> 01:39:20,875
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.

888
01:39:27,292 --> 01:39:30,250
Why don't you go upstairs?

889
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:35,625
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.

890
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:41,708
We all need that.

891
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:45,042
Do you come with me?

892
01:39:45,208 --> 01:39:46,500
Later.

893
01:39:48,042 --> 01:39:50,125
- Sure?
- Yes.

894
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:59,500
It's good that you are here.

895
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:21,458
I want to embrace you

896
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:24,250
my whole life.

897
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:30,042
I am here, you're in Moscow.

898
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:35,167
Nobody has arms that long.

899
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:37,917
Try it.

900
01:40:44,958 --> 01:40:50,208
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.

901
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:54,458
"The war is over."
He looked at me for a long while.

902
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:59,875
"Every newborn child
cries for war," he said.

903
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:05,333
Nothing and nobody, no man,
no nation, will stop this vicious circle.

904
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:08,375
Only death.

905
01:41:16,625 --> 01:41:19,708
Not so fast,
I am getting sick.

906
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:27,500
Gee.

907
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:31,958
Attention.

908
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,542
And now for everybody...

909
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:40,292
"I in love with you."

910
01:41:42,583 --> 01:41:43,875
Brbel.

911
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:16,750
Dance.

912
01:42:22,125 --> 01:42:24,458
Come on, let's go.

913
01:42:32,042 --> 01:42:36,083
We are not a people any more,
we're only "the population".

914
01:42:36,208 --> 01:42:40,125
I am talking about individuals
that form within a democracy.

915
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:44,375
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.

916
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:14,208
Dance, dance, you come.

917
01:43:18,917 --> 01:43:21,875
I think we should look at
the greater picture here.

918
01:43:21,875 --> 01:43:24,500
The countries of Europe
will burst their borders.

919
01:43:24,625 --> 01:43:28,708
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will,

920
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:31,917
just like Napoleon did,
re-order the political world map.

921
01:43:32,292 --> 01:43:36,708
So we will become a Soviet republic
with planned economy, huh?

922
01:43:49,667 --> 01:43:50,750
Thanks.

923
01:43:53,417 --> 01:43:57,458
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.

924
01:43:57,583 --> 01:44:01,583
Let's start the every day life again,
and we will soon get into the groove.

925
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:06,250
Slow down.

926
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:30,542
Drink.

927
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:45,167
The Soviet Union is just at
the beginning of its evolution.

928
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:49,083
The future will prove that.

929
01:44:52,125 --> 01:44:54,625
You love your country.

930
01:44:55,417 --> 01:44:57,792
Just as I love mine.

931
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:09,333
My mother once said that one day,

932
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:13,833
I would marry a man
who played the piano.

933
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:26,000
Everybody has been wondering
what this day would be like.

934
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:30,500
I haven't.

935
01:45:31,542 --> 01:45:34,000
Never.

936
01:45:42,208 --> 01:45:45,750
I didn't want to experience it.

937
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,667
Why not?

938
01:46:09,917 --> 01:46:14,625
If you don't do it, Andrej,
I will tell you something.

939
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:24,625
War is changing the words.

940
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:34,583
"Love" is not what it used to be.

941
01:46:41,333 --> 01:46:43,375
And yet,

942
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:49,750
in spite of that,

943
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:55,500
I want that my husband finds the
same wife that he left behind

944
01:46:55,542 --> 01:46:58,083
when he returns.

945
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:05,625
Please stay.

946
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:31,375
Us women,
we are branded for life.

947
01:47:32,833 --> 01:47:37,250
But for here and now,
right in this moment,

948
01:47:38,667 --> 01:47:41,750
I feel fantastic.

949
01:47:50,917 --> 01:47:54,000
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.

950
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:34,708
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?

951
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:44,167
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.

952
01:48:45,417 --> 01:48:47,458
And mummy?

953
01:48:52,958 --> 01:48:54,042
Ilse?

954
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Ilse?

955
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:01,958
Ilse?

956
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:20,792
Ilse.

957
01:49:22,167 --> 01:49:24,833
Ilse, get away from him.

958
01:49:40,333 --> 01:49:43,333
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.

959
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:46,000
We went to see Felix.

960
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:49,208
You could smell the tree resin.

961
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:53,958
We came across a cloud of butterflies.

962
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:59,167
And you knew all their names.

963
01:49:59,625 --> 01:50:06,167
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds,
Swallowtails and many more.

964
01:50:11,125 --> 01:50:13,917
One was taking a sunbath
right there on the path,

965
01:50:13,917 --> 01:50:16,167
it was velvety brown and
yellow with a blue hem.

966
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:19,875
You called it a Mourning Cloak.

967
01:50:48,625 --> 01:50:52,333
So many things I've
been given in my life.

968
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,375
In abundance.

969
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:56,583
The Major had lost everything.

970
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:59,875
Damn Russian idealist.

971
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,042
He takes it all like he
wants the world to be.

972
01:51:04,167 --> 01:51:07,125
Soviet apostle.

973
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:11,417
I like him though.

974
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:15,375
The less he wants from me,
the more I like him.

975
01:51:17,042 --> 01:51:18,167
Very much.

976
01:51:26,667 --> 01:51:27,792
Andrej.

977
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:31,333
Andrej.

978
01:52:02,417 --> 01:52:05,375
Andrej isn't here any more.

979
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:08,750
Relocated.

980
01:52:15,542 --> 01:52:16,667
To where?

981
01:52:21,667 --> 01:52:23,125
Unknown.

982
01:52:25,583 --> 01:52:26,917
Good-bye.

983
01:53:30,042 --> 01:53:33,125
"The birds so quiet,
the bells are silent."

984
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:36,625
(from "18 Little Songs of the
Bitter Homeland" by Yiannis Ritsos)

985
01:53:37,083 --> 01:53:39,750
Isn't that how it goes?

986
01:53:57,667 --> 01:53:59,000
Please, sit down.

987
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,625
The studio,

988
01:54:29,542 --> 01:54:31,583
is that gone?

989
01:54:44,917 --> 01:54:48,000
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.

990
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,583
Ukrainians like that.

991
01:55:47,667 --> 01:55:50,625
Here, that's for you.

992
01:56:57,542 --> 01:57:00,208
You are shameless.

993
01:57:00,542 --> 01:57:03,208
Don't you see that?

994
01:57:06,792 --> 01:57:10,500
It is disgusting
just to look at you.

995
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:12,458
Atten-shun!

996
01:58:47,125 --> 01:58:50,292
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?

997
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:56,833
That I had the chance
to get to know you.

998
01:59:06,333 --> 01:59:09,292
Take care of yourself.

999
01:59:25,667 --> 01:59:28,667
How are we supposed to live?

1000
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,583
Eyes front!

1001
02:00:19,958 --> 02:00:23,125
"Relocation," that's what they call it.

1002
02:00:24,958 --> 02:00:27,917
With full honors and merits.

1003
02:00:28,042 --> 02:00:31,667
To Siberia, who knows?

1004
02:00:53,833 --> 02:00:55,250
Gerd.

1005
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:59,292
My beloved Gerd.

1006
02:01:00,125 --> 02:01:03,042
What shall we do?

1007
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:05,792
Turn back the wheel of time?

1008
02:01:05,917 --> 02:01:09,000
Back to your very first words?

1009
02:01:10,375 --> 02:01:13,333
"30 minutes", you said.

1010
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:23,375
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will
never want to leave me again."

1011
02:04:01,208 --> 02:04:02,208
What?

1012
02:04:16,958 --> 02:04:18,083
What?

1013
02:04:25,083 --> 02:04:27,750
No answer.

1014
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:31,583
Two days later he was gone.

1015
02:04:32,042 --> 02:04:35,042
I don't know if he will come back.

1016
02:04:35,167 --> 02:04:38,750
I am surprised that I am
not suffering more.

1017
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:39,792
Maybe I am just too busy.

1018
02:04:40,708 --> 02:04:44,417
I need to find a piece of flint stone,

1019
02:04:44,542 --> 02:04:47,667
I need to mop up the
floor of the apartment

1020
02:04:47,667 --> 02:04:50,625
and I am desperately
looking for some flowers.

1021
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:53,708
Yesterday I found some lilac.

1022
02:04:54,958 --> 02:04:57,917
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.

1023
02:04:58,125 --> 02:05:00,167
Who knows?

1024
02:05:00,333 --> 02:05:02,750
Maybe our hearts have
a say in this, too,

1025
02:05:02,958 --> 02:05:06,417
and we'll see each other again,
some day.

1026
02:05:09,542 --> 02:05:13,958
When the diary "A woman in Berlin"
was first released in Germany in 1959,

1027
02:05:14,042 --> 02:05:15,583
it was a huge scandal.

1028
02:05:15,667 --> 02:05:20,000
Many people said that it was a disgrace
and an insult to the German women.

1029
02:05:20,292 --> 02:05:24,042
The author was so shocked by
the rejection and the contempt
that her book received.

1030
02:05:24,542 --> 02:05:28,208
She prohibited any further
releases for as long as she lived.

1031
02:05:28,625 --> 02:05:31,417
And even beyond her death,
here real name was never to be revealed.
