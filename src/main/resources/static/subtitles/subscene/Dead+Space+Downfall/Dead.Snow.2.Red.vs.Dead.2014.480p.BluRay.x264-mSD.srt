1
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:49,008
It all began so nice.

2
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:57,592
A bunch of friends at a cabin 
in the mountains. 

3
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:02,092
Lots of alcohol, laughter.
We had fun.

4
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:06,675
And then don't you fucking know it,
a squad of nazi zombies woke up.

5
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:13,842
I know.
It sounds like a cliché, 

6
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:16,633
but that's what happened.

7
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:21,342
You see, we found something.

8
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:25,175
Something we shouldn't have found.

9
00:01:27,717 --> 00:01:30,300
Old Nazi gold.

10
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,508
And then ... 

11
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,800
All hell broke loose.

12
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:51,675
They slaughtered us.
One .....

13
00:01:57,258 --> 00:02:00,133
.... by one.
One of them bit me.

14
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:04,550
But I knew how I could fix it.

15
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,592
My girlfriend Hanna .... 

16
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
They .... 

17
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,842
They got her too.

18
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:26,800
I got the gold.

19
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:32,092
Gave it back.

20
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,383
And they let me go.

21
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:48,925
I thought I was safe.

22
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,508
I was wrong.

23
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,467
Take the damn coin and go back 
to hell where you came from!

24
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:20,467
Shit, shit, shit.

25
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,258
Okay, okay.

26
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,800
I knew we should not
have touched the box.

27
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:42,175
Stay awake now.
Stay awake.

28
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:48,967
That's a good question, Toralf.
Of all migratory birds

29
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:53,842
there's a little critter
that really stands out.

30
00:06:54,008 --> 00:06:57,758
Namely, Arctic Terns,
or Sterna Paradisaea,

31
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:01,508
a coastal bound,
surface-feeding seabird 

32
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:04,300
from the group "Havterner".

33
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:10,592
Havternen maneuvers gracefully
in the air like a .... 

34
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:29,633
Troops, Sieg Heil!

35
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:33,967
Yes?

36
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:44,967
What do we have here?

37
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,425
Martin, can you hear me?

38
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:51,467
Hello, Martin.
Welcome back.

39
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:55,800
Martin, you crashed your car.

40
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:58,967
A nasty crash.
You are lucky to be alive.

41
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02,550
That is more than one can say
about your friends.

42
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,217
Have you seen ....

43
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,050
Have you seen the creatures?

44
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,175
The things.....

45
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:22,342
Have the police caught them?
Or the army?

46
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,383
Roy and Erlend?

47
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,258
- Hanna?
- We found our friends. All of them.

48
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:36,425
Dead.
Hanna was your girlfriend, right?

49
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:40,008
Very beautiful.
We found her too.

50
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:42,467
With an ax driven into the neck.

51
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:46,217
And your fingerprints on the shaft.

52
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:50,175
Do you have any idea
how that could happen?

53
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:53,008
They came up from ....

54
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:58,883
From the snow. Creatures. Nazis.
We got away, but ....

55
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,550
Nazis coming out of the ground?
Absurd.

56
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:07,342
Are you sure that he doesn't 
have brain damage as well?

57
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:13,383
Please call the family and tell them that he 
has awakened, and ask the D.A. to send a car.

58
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,842
And four additional men. It looks like 
you are ready to be transported.

59
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:21,508
They are still out there. They will kill
again if we do not stop them.

60
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:26,008
We are not going to stop anyone.
I've seen what you've done.

61
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:31,425
I was up there, and the only place you are going 
is to jail. No one knows what happened up there.

62
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:35,467
Only you know that.
And it's not only bad news.

63
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:41,133
When we found you, you were badly injured.
Your right arm was torn straight off.

64
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,467
- It was not torn ....
- When we found you, it was cold.

65
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:49,050
The snow had chilled all,
and that was very good.

66
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:53,217
- And then we found your arm in the car.
- In the car?

67
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:58,092
It was slightly bruised and quite 
pale for some strange reason,

68
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,633
but the surgery was a success.

69
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,842
We managed to re-attach your arm.

70
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,175
No, no, no.

71
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:27,175
- It's not my arm.
- Relax.

72
00:11:27,342 --> 00:11:31,217
It is Satan's arm!
It is Satan's arm!

73
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:33,800
Calm down.

74
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:42,967
No, it's not me!

75
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,550
No!

76
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:58,925
It's not me!
What the hell ...?

77
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:05,592
Stop!

78
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:00,675
Randi?

79
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:04,675
Be prepared to remove your 
dentures a bit later ...

80
00:13:04,842 --> 00:13:07,967
I'm ready for a little head tonight.

81
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:47,508
From the one that got away.

82
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:50,758
Nameless German Soldiers 
Who Fell In World War II

83
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:44,092
Broken.

84
00:15:44,258 --> 00:15:46,050
Warm.

85
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:51,508
The men have rotted.

86
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,175
We need more people.

87
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:13,300
Damn lock!

88
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,425
You scared me, Nils.

89
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,467
I can't take any more of your nonsense.
I've had a hell of a long day.

90
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:40,592
A wedding, a funeral
and a confirmation.

91
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:44,425
The one confirmant was damn fine.

92
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:47,133
If only I had been ten years younger ...

93
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,342
And not a priest, of course.

94
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:54,508
Nils?

95
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,550
Come on!

96
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:44,592
Sieg ....

97
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,925
Heil.

98
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:53,217
Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil.

99
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:11,967
They came down from the mountain.

100
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:14,925
I saw them.

101
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:36,717
Hey! Hey!

102
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:42,675
They are coming!
They're going to kill everyone!

103
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:51,883
Psst, hey.
Hey, you, psst. Yeah, you.

104
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,842
Hello.

105
00:19:56,758 --> 00:20:00,092
I saw your arm.
Looks really cool.

106
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:04,842
Took some pictures too.
Looks sick, but still cool.

107
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:10,925
I am not supposed to be in here,
but I snuck in here like a ninja.

108
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,425
Oh, I am Bobby.
I am here on vacation with my mom.

109
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,592
She ate some bad fish yesterday,
so ... yeah ..

110
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:24,842
Cool.
Seriously cool.

111
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:28,300
It looks burned.
And old.

112
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:32,008
Like a zombie arm.
Zombies are cool.

113
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:33,925
Zombies?

114
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:39,717
Oh, sorry, got to take this. They are 
wondering if I can get some more info.

115
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:42,967
More than just a picture of the arm.

116
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,383
Who? What?

117
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,300
The Zombie Squad. They are wondering 
if I can get some more info.

118
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,967
They are experts on zombies.
They live in America.

119
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:54,550
They have trained for this for years, 
just waiting for a zombie outbreak to happen.

120
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:58,967
So they can come here? Just tell them 
to come right now to get the zombies.

121
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,300
If they are experts they can kill 
the zombies for us!

122
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:04,133
I know. You've seen the zombies? 
'Cause they're real, right? Yeah!

123
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,967
- Can you let me loose?
- I'm not sure if I should, I mean, you're ..

124
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:15,092
- I have chocolate.
- You do?

125
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:21,508
Yeah, I have chocolate. 'Cause I could 
get it for you, but you know ...

126
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:25,342
- Double-triple-fudge.
- Oh my God ...!

127
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,633
Let me get this right here.

128
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:33,800
Come on.
You can do it.

129
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,925
Help me with the other.

130
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,508
- Can I have my chocolate now?
- There is no chocolate, kid.

131
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:50,633
- No chocolate?
- Shut the fuck up.

132
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,300
I got to get out.

133
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,258
Hey!

134
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:12,758
It's not what it looks like.

135
00:23:16,092 --> 00:23:17,925
Stop!

136
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,133
Hello?

137
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,717
This is Daniel Heffernan, leader of the 
Zombie Squad. Can I please speak to Bobby?

138
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:19,967
Bobby, uhh ...

139
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:24,383
- Bobby, he ... 
- I don't speak the language of Thor.

140
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,925
- Is Bobby there?
- Bobby was killed by zombies.

141
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,800
My God.

142
00:24:31,092 --> 00:24:35,550
Is this Zombie Squad? That is a 10.4, Martin, 
and we will be heading your way shortly.

143
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:40,842
But before we go we need as much information 
as you can give us. Anything you have.

144
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:43,050
Well, umm .....

145
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:49,508
We came up to the cabin,
and there was a bunch of ... of ..

146
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,508
Nazi zombies there and ...

147
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:56,633
You know, they killed us all, and .. 

148
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,633
Except me. Yeah, and ...

149
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,425
I had to saw my arm off and that, but ..

150
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:06,467
It's ... yeah, the arm is ... and ..

151
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:09,675
But then they wanted the 
treasure and the coin and ...

152
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,633
- Were any of you bitten?
- We were all bitten,

153
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,425
But we didn't become one of them.
We just ....

154
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,342
We just died, so ...

155
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:27,300
Listen, Martin, and listen good.

156
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:30,092
These are not your classic 
textbook zombies,

157
00:25:30,258 --> 00:25:35,800
just hungering to feast on the flesh of man. 
No, these are most likely cursed zombies.

158
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,883
Awakened to reclaim something that 
was stolen from them,

159
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:43,717
- or to complete a task given to them.
- They called him Herzog, they ... 

160
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,217
They called him Herzog.

161
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:51,883
Martin of the North, 
we will be on our way shortly,

162
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,092
and we will take care of
this infection.

163
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:58,425
We are professionals.
But until then,

164
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:03,342
find out what they seek, 
their purpose. Bye.

165
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:12,717
Zombie Squad, they are ....

166
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,300
They are professionals.

167
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,008
They are bad ass.

168
00:26:20,175 --> 00:26:22,175
Okay, girls.

169
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:25,425
It looks like we're going to Norway.

170
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:35,133
Norway? We can't go to Norway.
That's on the other side of the world.

171
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:41,217
Yeah, and how do we know it's for real? I mean, Daniel, 
that is a long way to go to find out if it's a hoax?

172
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,258
You saw the picture.

173
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:46,592
This is a bonafide infected arm.
You know this. 

174
00:26:46,758 --> 00:26:50,883
All the signs are there, guys. The decayed 
skin, the rotten hair, the dark blood.

175
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,800
- This is real, guys, it's real.
- This could be dangerous.

176
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:58,217
No shit, it's fucking zombies.
Of course it will be dangerous!

177
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:03,717
But this is what we've been waiting for. This is our 
chance  to prove to everyone that we were right.

178
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:08,925
I mean, we've been telling everyone for 
years that it is just a matter of time

179
00:27:09,092 --> 00:27:13,258
before the first outbreak happens.
And what have we seen in return?

180
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:17,425
Laughter. Ridicule.

181
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:20,758
Wedgies.

182
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:25,217
Well, guess who was right?

183
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:30,092
- Guess who's laughing now?
- I guess we're laughing now?

184
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:34,925
You're damn right we are. I mean, what did we start 
the Zombie Squad for if it wasn't for this?

185
00:27:35,092 --> 00:27:37,175
- He's right.
- Damn right I'm right.

186
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:42,675
And besides, if we don't do this...
If we don't go there and help these people...

187
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:45,217
Who the hell will?
Yeah ....

188
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,925
- So what do we do?
- Yes!

189
00:27:51,092 --> 00:27:54,967
Okay, we need as much information as we 
can get on this Herzog character,

190
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,800
on Martin and north of Norway, everything.

191
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,467
Oh wait, hold on, guys.
We can't let our landlords know about this.

192
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:04,592
- Do you mean our parents?
- Yes, our parents, but ...

193
00:28:04,758 --> 00:28:08,008
- We just can't tell them what's happening.
- Got it.

194
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:11,342
Alright, official members of the 
Zombie Squad USA....

195
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,800
- Oh my God ...!
- It's time to go hunting.

196
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,633
That was further than usual.

197
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:55,508
I poured you some coffee.

198
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:01,092
- Damn, it is cold.
- It's because you're 40 minutes late.

199
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:05,467
I am on winter time.
That winter time, summer time system ..

200
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:10,008
It's so stupid.
What do you have?

201
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:13,717
Not much. Petra's boy has been
shoplifting again.

202
00:29:13,883 --> 00:29:18,592
They should have done what they do in Iran.
Cut off his hands. Taught him a lesson.

203
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:22,300
And Ove's dog has pooped 
in Mr. Olsen's garden.

204
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:24,217
- Shoot him.
- Shoot Mr. Olsen?

205
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:27,133
Not shoot Mr. Olsen. 
You shoot the dog!

206
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,925
In addition we have a lecture in school
about the danger of using marijuana.

207
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,550
Boring ....

208
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:38,383
There was one thing, though.
From Oksfjord.

209
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:42,300
Oksfjord? No, no, no, it is 
not our jurisdiction.

210
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:47,008
Martin Hykkerud escaped from the 
hospital yesterday.

211
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:51,925
Martin Hykkerud? The same Martin Hykkerud who 
killed his friends on top of the mountain?

212
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:57,300
Yeah. He escaped from the hospital yesterday 
and killed a little boy and a policeman ...

213
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:01,175
by throwing a Mercedes star at his face.

214
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,050
- He cut off the Mercedes star?
- Yeah.

215
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:08,133
- What does Oslo say?
- About the Mercedes star?

216
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,467
About the Hykkerud case!

217
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:14,842
They say we all need to be on alert, 
and that we need to get more people.

218
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:17,550
Hold the fort until they can send a team.

219
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:21,217
Send a team, more people ... Where the hell 
do I find the money to bring in more people?

220
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:26,008
I don't even have money to buy new 
batteries for the cars out here.

221
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:28,008
Okay. Right.

222
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:32,758
What?

223
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:37,217
Didn't we agree on a more 
casual style here?

224
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,008
Continue.

225
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:55,133
My God, I was expecting something like the 
Hoth system, but this is more like Endor.

226
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,258
Can't you reference anything 
other than Star Wars?

227
00:30:58,425 --> 00:31:03,717
- Like Star Trek maybe if I can't sleep.
- Yeah, at least it is based on scientific theories ...

228
00:31:03,883 --> 00:31:06,633
- Guys, guys, I have a lock on Martin.
- Where is he?

229
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,342
- Ice Bay.
- Ok, let's go!

230
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:13,842
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
First there is something we need to do.

231
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:17,467
- Oh yeah, I really have to pee.
- No!

232
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:21,758
Arm up!
You really fucking ruined that.

233
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:20,342
It would be a lot easier if  we 
could buy  weapons here. I know.

234
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:23,508
What the fuck's the matter with
this country?

235
00:33:10,925 --> 00:33:13,425
Can I help you?

236
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,800
Too much coffee. 
You just go ahead. 

237
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:19,717
Best for you if you move on.

238
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:39,883
This is a war museum, huh?

239
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,217
Yes.

240
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:43,092
Yes, and ....

241
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:48,967
Do you have any information
about the Germans?

242
00:34:56,258 --> 00:34:57,717
Help!

243
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:03,133
Listen to me!

244
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:08,383
I don't have time for this now. They're coming, 
and we must stop them! Do you understand.

245
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:12,175
I have two kittens at home. 
Please  don't hurt me. Shut up!

246
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:17,133
Just help me.
Please.

247
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,258
- Do you have information about Einsatz?
- Yes.

248
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:24,842
- First floor.
- First floor.

249
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,342
Where the hell are you?

250
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:43,842
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

251
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:53,758
Hitler's buddy.

252
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:58,175
- Nice, huh?
- Do not touch the exhibit.

253
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,342
Herzog was made commander of 
Einsatz in 1942,

254
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:07,467
and was sent to the far north of Norway,
in order to protect the warships

255
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:11,175
that the German Navy was hiding 
in the fjords.

256
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:18,300
He was on duty in Oksfjord doing a routine 
inspection on the ship Scharnholst, when ...

257
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,050
Scharnholst.

258
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:27,467
When Tirpitz, the German
fleet's biggest warship 

259
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:31,383
was attacked by English bombers in Talvik,

260
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,717
after getting vital information on the 
ships location from Norwegian spies.

261
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:40,758
Hitler, humiliated by the attack on 
Tirpitz ordered Herzog

262
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:46,925
to wipe out all of the 800 men, and people 
who lived in Talvik at the time.

263
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:52,717
He was on his way?

264
00:36:52,883 --> 00:36:59,092
He was on his way to Talvik the evening him 
and his men were slaughtered in Oksfjord?

265
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,175
On a mission from Hitler.

266
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:12,050
A mission that was never completed. 
That is what it is. That's exactly what it is.

267
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:16,217
They will destroy Talvik.

268
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,967
Where .....?

269
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:28,383
Herzog was going from Oksfjord,

270
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,758
which is here.

271
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:33,967
And he was going to Talvik.

272
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,508
It's here.

273
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:38,550
Where are we now?

274
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,217
Where are we now?!

275
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,175
Here.

276
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:48,133
Ice Bay.

277
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:55,550
It is right between ....

278
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:42,508
They are recruiting!

279
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:47,800
They make new soldiers.
Can they do that now? Fuck!

280
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:51,050
Okay, they're coming here.
They're coming here.

281
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:55,925
I will not die in a museum with 
a guy in a green jogging suit.

282
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:58,717
Calm down.
You will die.

283
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,758
But relax.
Not today.

284
00:41:54,717 --> 00:41:56,508
There!

285
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:01,217
Let's see what this thing can do.

286
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:03,217
What kind of thing?

287
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,092
What did you do?
You just killed them without ...

288
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:37,050
It's the arm, man.

289
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:42,050
Before I could not control it,
but now it does what I think.

290
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:44,717
You're not even sweating.

291
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:47,467
Don't worry about it.

292
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:57,217
They will increase in numbers.
Damn, they will be many.

293
00:42:57,383 --> 00:43:00,300
There are too many for this arm.

294
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,550
So much death.

295
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:33,717
All this unnecessary death.

296
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:05,383
Fuck!

297
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,383
You did what the fucker
did before. You just ...

298
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,800
- You ...
- No, it was the arm. It was the arm.

299
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,175
He doesn't attack.

300
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:56,883
Did you see that? Did you see that?
I hit it!

301
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:00,342
I hit it! Oh my God.
I did it. I fucking did it!

302
00:45:00,508 --> 00:45:03,175
I hit it right in the eye.
Oh my God, oh my God.

303
00:45:03,342 --> 00:45:06,842
Take a picture. 
Please take a picture of me.

304
00:45:07,008 --> 00:45:10,050
- First Zombie Squad kill.
- One, two .... 

305
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:12,175
Cheese ...!

306
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:15,175
Did you get it?

307
00:45:15,342 --> 00:45:20,133
Oh, we spoke on the phone. I am Daniel. 
This is Blake and Monica.

308
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,800
We are the Zombie Squad.

309
00:45:24,967 --> 00:45:28,467
- God damn it.
- It is real. These are real dead people.

310
00:45:28,633 --> 00:45:31,467
And that's a real zombie.
You killed him.

311
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:35,383
- I can't believe it.
- Can we just focus for one second, guys?

312
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,758
I'm so sorry.
We are more professional than this.

313
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:42,925
- You're the Zombie Squad?
- Yep.

314
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:45,508
- You are the Zombie Squad.
- Yeah, we are the Zombie Squad.

315
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:49,717
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I was just expecting something different.

316
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:54,092
So was this guy when he woke 
up this morning.

317
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:58,800
'Cause I hit him in the face
with an ax.

318
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:02,383
- Yeah, how did you find me?
- We tracked your iPhone, of course.

319
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:06,133
We're fucking nerds. It's what we do.
Technical shit. Let's cut the chit chat.

320
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,508
What did you find out?
What do the creatures want?

321
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,675
Revenge.

322
00:47:19,133 --> 00:47:22,258
This is insane!

323
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:26,592
You? 
You have the gift?

324
00:47:26,758 --> 00:47:29,592
The force is strong with this one.

325
00:47:29,758 --> 00:47:31,467
Ok.

326
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:39,883
Martin, this is how we defeat them.
This is how we take them down.

327
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,425
- What do you mean?
- I mean ...

328
00:47:44,717 --> 00:47:47,008
We create an army of our own.

329
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,008
I tried to get as much information 
as I could on my trip over.

330
00:47:51,175 --> 00:47:54,842
Especially about Herzog. To defeat your
enemy, you must know your enemy.

331
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:58,383
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
from the Soviet army.

332
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:02,050
He and his battalion was captured 
during the battle of Kursk,

333
00:48:02,217 --> 00:48:05,050
and brought here to the north of 
Norway as POWs.

334
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:08,717
In 44 they were all sent
to Kvenang mountain ..

335
00:48:08,883 --> 00:48:11,300
..to build a road through 
the mountain pass.

336
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:16,300
But it was after they built the road 
that shit got ugly.

337
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:21,925
All of the prisoners were shot.
Shot to death!

338
00:48:22,092 --> 00:48:24,925
No survivors.

339
00:48:25,092 --> 00:48:28,550
And the man in charge?

340
00:48:28,717 --> 00:48:30,467
Herzog.

341
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,967
Those bodies are still buried there.

342
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:39,800
Buried in the frozen soil.
Preserved, waiting...

343
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:46,508
- Waiting for what?
- The same thing that drives Herzog.

344
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:51,175
Revenge. 
And guess who is gonna give it to them.

345
00:48:53,258 --> 00:48:57,217
- The man who can raise the dead?
- Fucking yeah ...!

346
00:48:57,383 --> 00:49:02,175
You guys go after Herzog. Try to slow him down 
and give us as much time as possible, ok?

347
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:05,050
- What if this doesn't work?
- It has to.

348
00:49:05,217 --> 00:49:08,550
All we have to do is to get to Kvenang mountain,
find Stavarin, wake him back from the dead,

349
00:49:08,717 --> 00:49:12,175
and bring him back to Talvik so he can 
help us fight Herzog and his men.

350
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:15,633
Easy. Besides ......

351
00:49:17,217 --> 00:49:20,008
We got help.

352
00:49:24,467 --> 00:49:27,300
Here we go.

353
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,467
He is our last hope.

354
00:49:52,758 --> 00:49:54,925
Look, a tank.

355
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:17,800
- A visit at this hour?
- That was early.

356
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:36,175
Hello?

357
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:47,008
Look.
His army is growing bigger.

358
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:52,550
Glenn, are there any more towns or 
villages before he reaches Talvik?

359
00:51:52,717 --> 00:51:57,508
- Maybe a few houses, but that's it.
- Good. So what he has now he will use for his attack.

360
00:51:57,675 --> 00:52:02,133
Yeah, pretty much. That is until he starts killing the 
people of Talvik and makes them join him as well.

361
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,550
- How many people live in Talvik?
- About 3000.

362
00:52:05,717 --> 00:52:09,675
What, holy shit! All the more reason for 
us to slow them down as much as we can.

363
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:16,592
Look. Do you know how to use one of those things?
Of course. I am from northern Norway, aren't I.

364
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:20,300
I don't know what that means.
Guys, pack light.

365
00:52:20,467 --> 00:52:23,008
We're moving out. Now!

366
00:52:28,217 --> 00:52:32,258
What the hell happened here?

367
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:35,175
What are the investigators saying?

368
00:52:35,342 --> 00:52:39,133
They are not investigators, is's only 
Tom and Ole wearing white suits today.

369
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,633
They thought it might make them 
look more professional.

370
00:52:43,383 --> 00:52:46,800
A forensic team with real investigators 
should get here later tonight.

371
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:51,508
- Do we have any witnesses?
- Not unless you can make the seagulls talk.

372
00:52:51,675 --> 00:52:55,133
Seagulls..... yes.
That would make a damn good invention.

373
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,300
A gadget that translates
seagull language to human language.

374
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,717
That inventor would get filthy rich.

375
00:53:02,883 --> 00:53:06,133
Get the bodies to Talvik
before the seagulls eat them.

376
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,425
And take lots of pictures, otherwise
Forensics will cut off my balls.

377
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:15,383
Boss, here are pictures
from the surveillance camera.

378
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,925
Isn't that...?

379
00:53:25,217 --> 00:53:28,633
Lick me deep in my manpussy ....!

380
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:36,758
Okay, guys, guys!
We are in a hurry. Come on!

381
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:39,550
Come on, damn it!
We have things to do!

382
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:45,175
There they are.
And they have a tank, I see.

383
00:53:45,342 --> 00:53:48,133
Yeah, they stole it from the museum.

384
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,717
Fuck!

385
00:53:52,258 --> 00:53:56,508
- What is that?
- The largest tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

386
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:59,425
No, no, no.
That. What is that?

387
00:53:59,592 --> 00:54:04,258
These are replicas of the binoculars that 
Han and Chewie used on the planet Hoth.

388
00:54:04,425 --> 00:54:08,508
Did you guys know fun fact?
All of the Hoth scenes 

389
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:12,800
were filmed here in Norway.
This place called Finse.

390
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:18,008
Girls, could we please maybe focus on, 
you know, the Nazi zombies instead?

391
00:54:18,175 --> 00:54:22,675
What do we do? Well, Daniel told us to slow 
them down, so that's what we're gonna do.

392
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,633
Look.

393
00:54:25,633 --> 00:54:30,008
We need to get out there, get their attention 
and lure them into the swamps, right.

394
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:35,467
And then when they get stuck, we can use the fertilizer 
bombs we made and blow them into bits and pieces.

395
00:54:35,633 --> 00:54:37,883
That sounds basically impossible.

396
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,800
And how are you planning on luring them 
out there? We need bait. Live bait.

397
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:45,425
Yes, we need someone to attract 
their attention.

398
00:54:45,592 --> 00:54:48,425
Someone who is light on their feet.

399
00:54:48,592 --> 00:54:53,342
Who knows these swamps and can move 
through them without getting stuck.

400
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:01,217
What?

401
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:03,092
No.

402
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,300
No. That's a swamp.
I'm not getting out there.

403
00:55:06,467 --> 00:55:10,342
Who says I won't get stuck?
And one more thing ...

404
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:13,633
Those things are fucking zombies
who want to rip my face off.

405
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,758
Talvik is you hometown, am I right?

406
00:55:16,925 --> 00:55:20,508
- Yeah.
- You must have people you love there.

407
00:55:20,675 --> 00:55:25,425
Yeah. Especially one ma ... woman,
that I love.

408
00:55:25,592 --> 00:55:31,508
- Long hair and big boobs.
- Do it for "her".

409
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:36,008
You just bring them here, 
and we'll do the rest. Capice?

410
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,925
Hey man? Martin?

411
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:51,383
- Yeah?
- Are you okay?

412
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,300
Yeah, I ...

413
00:55:54,925 --> 00:55:58,258
First, we wake up a battalion 
of Nazi zombies,

414
00:55:58,425 --> 00:56:02,508
and now I'm supposed to wake up
a bunch of dead Russian guys.

415
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:05,508
Look, your arm, your power,

416
00:56:05,675 --> 00:56:09,717
is the only thing that can take down 
Herzog at this point. Remember that.

417
00:56:09,883 --> 00:56:11,967
If we don't succeed,

418
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:16,925
his power will keep growing
until he's unstoppable.

419
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:22,592
That, my friend,
is a big bowl of shit

420
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:25,675
that we don't want to live in.

421
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,467
Oh my God.
That is vile smelling.

422
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:41,508
How did it fill up the car so fast?
That smell ....!

423
00:56:41,675 --> 00:56:46,550
- It's alright, he's just carsick or something.
- That smells foul.

424
00:56:46,717 --> 00:56:48,467
No, no, no no!

425
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:51,425
Fuck, that's disgusting!

426
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:56,342
That smells.

427
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:44,758
I didn't know it was an
ugly-nosed congress in town.

428
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,133
Come and get me, then.

429
00:57:52,508 --> 00:57:55,217
Come and get me if you dare.

430
00:58:16,383 --> 00:58:17,717
Move!

431
00:58:22,133 --> 00:58:24,092
Halt!

432
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:29,758
- It's working. They are following him.
- But not Herzog and most of his men. Shit.

433
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:35,967
No, no, it's ok. We got their attention. If we 
take these guys out, he will come for us instead.

434
00:58:38,925 --> 00:58:40,967
Come on, Glenn!

435
00:58:44,717 --> 00:58:47,175
Run faster!

436
00:59:09,425 --> 00:59:10,133
Yes!

437
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:19,425
Come on, Glenn!

438
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,342
Yes.

439
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:32,175
- Run, Glenn!
- Faster!

440
00:59:32,342 --> 00:59:34,050
Run, run!

441
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:43,633
Please, God.

442
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,842
Yes!

443
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:54,758
Oh my God, Blake!

444
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,800
USA, USA!

445
00:59:58,967 --> 01:00:01,008
USA!

446
01:00:03,592 --> 01:00:05,258
Fire!

447
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:18,758
Hey. The tank is moving.

448
01:00:21,258 --> 01:00:23,800
That can't be good.

449
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:38,925
Run!

450
01:00:43,842 --> 01:00:45,342
Run!

451
01:00:54,883 --> 01:00:55,925
Oh my God!

452
01:01:19,925 --> 01:01:21,842
Talvik. Now.

453
01:02:15,883 --> 01:02:17,633
Hey.

454
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,758
- Where are we?
- We're getting close.

455
01:02:22,925 --> 01:02:25,133
But we're also stuck.

456
01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:33,550
- Can I push it?
- I don't think that would help.

457
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:38,175
- Is it far? We could walk.
- We don't have that kind of time.

458
01:02:40,842 --> 01:02:43,300
If only we could find something

459
01:02:43,467 --> 01:02:47,467
to put under the car, you know.
Something that would give us traction.

460
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:50,383
Then I could get us out of here.

461
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:44,342
- There you are.
- Damn hard to find room for all the bodies.

462
01:03:44,508 --> 01:03:49,217
The cooler is completely full. We had to throw 
the rest in the garage with some ice cubes.

463
01:03:49,383 --> 01:03:52,883
- Sounds like a perfect solution.
- Thank you.

464
01:03:53,883 --> 01:03:59,008
Mostly Germans and French. Hardly the vacation they 
envisioned when they got their tickets for Norway.

465
01:03:59,175 --> 01:04:02,842
Having their heads and arms ripped off and 
entrails pulled out? I doubt it.

466
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:05,717
Unless they like that kind of kinky stuff.

467
01:04:11,092 --> 01:04:13,967
- Should you do that?
- No.

468
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:17,217
- Shouldn't Forensics have been here by now?
- It was so windy down in Alta

469
01:04:17,383 --> 01:04:21,508
that the plane couldn't land. They said 
they should be here tomorrow afternoon.

470
01:04:24,633 --> 01:04:27,550
- It's perfect.
- What?

471
01:04:28,758 --> 01:04:31,467
It's our chance.

472
01:04:31,633 --> 01:04:35,425
Now, we can fucking show people
what we're made of here.

473
01:04:35,592 --> 01:04:40,300
Us here at Talvik Police will
find Martin Hykkerud ourselves.

474
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:44,675
We will get him. Us.
We will be heroes.

475
01:04:44,842 --> 01:04:48,800
Not the goddamn suit-cladded,

476
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:52,383
Sushi-eating cocksuckers down south.

477
01:04:53,217 --> 01:04:55,508
Beef the guys....

478
01:04:55,675 --> 01:05:00,842
Brief the guys. Send photos to all
the cops here in Talvik.

479
01:05:01,008 --> 01:05:05,717
If he as much as stops to pee, I want to 
know the color and smell of his urine.

480
01:05:06,967 --> 01:05:09,883
- Odor and color.
- And get the weapons ready.

481
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,550
For once we will shoot at something 
other that seagulls.

482
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:21,300
Do you really think this is 
going to work?

483
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:26,300
I mean, say we actually manage to wake 
these Russians back to life.

484
01:05:26,467 --> 01:05:29,300
What's stopping them from killing us?

485
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:35,300
I don't know what's gonna happen.
But judging based on him?

486
01:05:35,467 --> 01:05:39,383
He treats you like you're his master.
So hopefully they do the same.

487
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,508
Hopefully.

488
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:45,633
Hopefully .... I don't know, man.
This is some unprecedented, unheard of,

489
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,842
mysterious voodoo zombie shit, man.
I've never seen this before.

490
01:05:51,008 --> 01:05:56,342
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not in any of them.

491
01:05:56,508 --> 01:06:00,300
You have created a whole 
new genre here, man.

492
01:06:00,467 --> 01:06:04,800
Look, I mean, if we are gonna go up 
against a battalion of Nazi zombies,

493
01:06:04,967 --> 01:06:08,800
we could do a whole lot worse than teaming 
up with a battalion of Russian zombies.

494
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:15,300
He has to die, you know. 
Herzog.

495
01:06:15,467 --> 01:06:19,092
For what he did.
We have to kill him.

496
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:24,633
I have to kill him.
For Hanna.

497
01:06:28,008 --> 01:06:31,133
- This is it.
- Yeah.

498
01:06:32,967 --> 01:06:35,675
This is definitely it.

499
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:41,342
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

500
01:06:41,508 --> 01:06:46,175
So they got be buried in 
this frozen ground.

501
01:06:48,342 --> 01:06:50,425
How do we do this?

502
01:06:50,592 --> 01:06:52,342
You do it ... 

503
01:06:53,508 --> 01:06:55,258
just like you did .... with him.

504
01:06:55,425 --> 01:06:58,092
I put my hand on his head.

505
01:06:59,467 --> 01:07:01,842
Okay. Right.

506
01:07:03,717 --> 01:07:06,383
We can't dig up everyone.
It'll take weeks.

507
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,800
You have to wake them up,
one way or another.

508
01:09:34,008 --> 01:09:37,467
Master!

509
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:45,342
Fuck, yeah!

510
01:10:19,592 --> 01:10:21,842
He was first seen here.

511
01:10:23,425 --> 01:10:25,258
In Oksfjord.

512
01:10:26,383 --> 01:10:31,092
And next time here.
Museum at Ice Bay.

513
01:10:31,258 --> 01:10:35,675
Then he appears to be heading south. 
Perhaps there.

514
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:39,633
We have a problem.

515
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:44,467
A gang dressed as Germans
going crazy out there?

516
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:47,675
Crazy?
They killed loads of people, so yeah.

517
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:52,633
What's happening. We haven't had a murder since 74,
and suddenly we have Ragnarok on our doorstep.

518
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,383
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shoot first, ask later!

519
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:47,133
There is no one here.
We have sent them away.

520
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,508
They are gone.

521
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:55,008
Since you can't complete your mission,

522
01:11:55,175 --> 01:11:59,675
you might as well just turn
and go back to your snow cave.

523
01:12:27,883 --> 01:12:31,592
Some have grown a bit since last time.
Gotten a little bigger.

524
01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:38,758
I brought a couple of buddies to 
the dance.

525
01:13:24,592 --> 01:13:27,717
Don't you get a bitter feeling when 
somebody you thought were dead 

526
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:30,758
have come back to kill you?

527
01:13:58,217 --> 01:14:00,175
Let's kill them.

528
01:14:00,342 --> 01:14:01,758
Troops!

529
01:14:05,008 --> 01:14:06,550
Attack!

530
01:14:10,758 --> 01:14:13,133
Let's kill them all!

531
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:28,258
What the hell is going on here?
Is the carnival in town?

532
01:16:21,967 --> 01:16:23,967
Is that a tank?

533
01:16:33,633 --> 01:16:35,717
- Damn!
- Run!

534
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:37,467
Help!

535
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,842
Daniel! Tank!

536
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:22,675
- Shouldn't we help them?
- Help who?

537
01:18:22,842 --> 01:18:27,842
Those with bad skin in German uniforms or 
those with bad skin in Russian uniforms?

538
01:18:57,925 --> 01:18:59,508
Okay.

539
01:19:12,425 --> 01:19:14,300
Good boy.

540
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:30,425
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!
- What the hell is going on?

541
01:19:30,592 --> 01:19:33,842
Damn if I know.
Looks like a video game.

542
01:19:34,008 --> 01:19:36,467
Look, that's him. 
It's Martin Hykkerud!

543
01:19:38,425 --> 01:19:39,883
- Damn, it's him.
- Should we get him?

544
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:43,383
No, no, no, no.
Let's wait until it calms down.

545
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:47,050
Tactical police work.

546
01:20:13,425 --> 01:20:15,717
Zombie Squad. 
It's about time!

547
01:20:15,883 --> 01:20:18,258
- That's a long story.
- There was a tank.

548
01:20:18,425 --> 01:20:20,758
A guy took my jacket.

549
01:20:20,925 --> 01:20:25,925
Looks like you found Stavarin and his men, I see.
Yeah, but they're still more than us.

550
01:20:26,092 --> 01:20:28,925
I guess it's time we even 
out the odds a bit, huh.

551
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:15,550
Folks! We're losing!

552
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:18,592
Look!

553
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,342
Shit!

554
01:21:32,383 --> 01:21:34,383
No, no, no.

555
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,633
No!

556
01:21:45,175 --> 01:21:46,883
Wait!

557
01:21:47,717 --> 01:21:49,883
We have to kill him!

558
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:52,758
They're all bound to him like the 
Russians are to you.

559
01:21:52,925 --> 01:21:56,008
If he dies, the others will too.

560
01:21:58,383 --> 01:22:01,758
Let's finish this.

561
01:22:03,842 --> 01:22:05,758
Untermensch.

562
01:23:22,092 --> 01:23:25,133
Guys, come on.
No seat belts?

563
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,508
You're asking for it.

564
01:23:57,467 --> 01:24:00,258
Fucking hell!
How many more of these are there?

565
01:24:05,467 --> 01:24:08,217
Is this it?

566
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:12,842
Monica, is this how it's gonna end?

567
01:24:13,008 --> 01:24:14,717
No, no.

568
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:18,050
- Are we gonna die now?
- No.

569
01:24:20,758 --> 01:24:22,550
Fuck it.

570
01:24:23,883 --> 01:24:26,258
Fuck it, I'm just gonna say it.

571
01:24:27,675 --> 01:24:29,383
I, 

572
01:24:30,133 --> 01:24:32,342
Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, am ...

573
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,008
No!

574
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:38,925
- Blake!
- Glenn?

575
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,592
Monica ..

576
01:27:48,217 --> 01:27:51,217
Why didn't you just stay
on the mountain?

577
01:27:55,550 --> 01:28:00,842
You got what you wanted.
You got the gold. The treasure.

578
01:28:04,967 --> 01:28:07,217
But it was not enough.

579
01:28:09,967 --> 01:28:13,133
You were greedy.

580
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,383
You wanted more.

581
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:18,467
Blake!

582
01:28:21,425 --> 01:28:23,800
- Monica.
- Watch out.

583
01:28:26,758 --> 01:28:28,592
- Monica!
- Blake!

584
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,925
Blake! No!

585
01:28:46,217 --> 01:28:48,758
That's why you lost, you know.

586
01:28:48,925 --> 01:28:52,300
Because you were greedy.

587
01:28:57,675 --> 01:29:00,800
You know you lost the war?

588
01:29:02,592 --> 01:29:05,217
Lost everything.

589
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:09,842
Ridiculed.

590
01:29:10,008 --> 01:29:12,342
Pathetic.

591
01:29:13,633 --> 01:29:15,217
And you know what?

592
01:29:17,508 --> 01:29:18,883
You lose again.

593
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:29,675
No!

594
01:29:42,883 --> 01:29:44,592
Oh my God!

595
01:29:47,675 --> 01:29:49,592
He did it!

596
01:29:49,758 --> 01:29:54,883
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked. I knew it.

597
01:29:56,467 --> 01:29:58,717
Herzog is dead.

598
01:29:58,883 --> 01:30:01,133
He is dead. Yes!

599
01:30:16,633 --> 01:30:19,383
Holy cow, that was close.

600
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:34,633
You did it!
You killed Herzog?

601
01:30:35,925 --> 01:30:39,050
I can't believe that 
that actually worked,

602
01:30:39,217 --> 01:30:41,883
Of course it did.

603
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:44,842
You doubted the Zombie Squad?

604
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:49,008
Glenn Kenneth, is he ...?

605
01:30:51,467 --> 01:30:53,508
He didn't make it.

606
01:31:04,675 --> 01:31:08,675
It's been a true honor killing 
zombies with you guys.

607
01:31:09,425 --> 01:31:12,425
You too, Martin.

608
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,258
What is it? 
Okay.

609
01:31:21,467 --> 01:31:24,133
- You can say it.
- Go for it.

610
01:31:27,467 --> 01:31:30,175
May the Force be with you.

611
01:31:33,675 --> 01:31:37,675
Really? That one?
Of all ...? You chose that one?

612
01:31:37,842 --> 01:31:41,967
There's like a million to chose from,
why would you chose that one?

613
01:32:06,092 --> 01:32:09,425
- Where the hell are they? They were just here. 
- Damn if I know.

614
01:32:09,592 --> 01:32:13,342
Damn! Bjarne!

615
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,550
Are you in a coma?

616
01:32:16,717 --> 01:32:19,092
Go and find them, damn it!

617
01:32:22,883 --> 01:32:28,175
I should have solved this case.
Ending up with a hundred new bodies...

618
01:32:28,342 --> 01:32:33,383
Where do we put them all?
The garage and the cooler are packed.

619
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:36,800
I don't know! I don't know.

620
01:32:42,717 --> 01:32:47,925
The seagulls again. They haven't
eaten this good since the war.

621
01:32:49,925 --> 01:32:53,550
We should have had the 
damn machine, you know.

622
01:32:53,717 --> 01:32:56,967
A machine to translate seagull 
language to human language.

623
01:32:57,133 --> 01:33:00,800
Then we would have cracked this case 
wide open like an egg. You get it!

624
01:33:00,967 --> 01:33:03,842
Like an egg.
