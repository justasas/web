1
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,300
DOWNFALL

2
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:26,391
I feel as if I should be angry
with that child, that...

3
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,240
naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...

4
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:35,681
for not recognising the nature of that monster.

5
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:39,678
For not being aware of what she was getting into.

6
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:43,943
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

7
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:49,868
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said, in Berlin:

8
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:55,862
'No, I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters.'

9
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:59,277
But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.

10
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:02,555
I also didn't realise...

11
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:08,749
that destiny would take me
somewhere I didn't want to be.

12
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:15,542
But, nevertheless, I find
it hard to forgive myself.

13
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,836
The ladies are here.

14
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:28,429
It's confirmed.
- They can pass.

15
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:01,086
'Wolfsschanze' headquarters of the Führer

16
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:05,026
November 1942 Rastenburg, East-Prussia

17
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,991
Sit down, ladies.

18
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:16,893
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

19
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,080
Can you tell us... How are we
supposed to address the Führer?

20
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:27,771
The Führer first speaks to you and
then you reply: Heil, mein Führer.

21
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,769
And the Nazi salute?

22
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:32,266
That won't be necessary...

23
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:38,091
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier, but for a secretary.

24
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,150
Act as normal and calm as you can.

25
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:44,577
I'll see if he has time for you.

26
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,890
Mein Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

27
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:15,523
Thank you for coming in the middle of the night.

28
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:20,813
Sometimes, during a war,
one is not in control of time.

29
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,412
Can I ask your name?
- Margarethe Lorenz.

30
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:29,832
Where are you from?
- From Fulda.

31
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,305
And what is your name?
- Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Führer.

32
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:37,465
No need for that.
Where are you from?

33
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,551
Frankfurt am Main, mein Füh...

34
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:45,194
Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

35
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:47,419
In Pankow, to be precise.

36
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,891
Hedwig Brandt from Crailsheim, Schwaben.

37
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:56,327
And you are?
- Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

38
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,380
A lady from Munich.

39
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:11,768
Shall we start then,
Fräulein Humps?

40
00:04:22,857 --> 00:04:26,937
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

41
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:30,549
She's much smarter than most people.

42
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:38,341
First, sit down, please.

43
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:43,136
Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.

44
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:46,633
You won't make nearly as many.

45
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:57,622
You're very young.

46
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:02,717
How old are you?
- 22, mein Führer.

47
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:11,608
My German fellow-countrymen and women...

48
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:13,806
fellow party members.

49
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:18,401
It is, I think, rather special...

50
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:25,901
that, after 20 years of service, a man
still stands in front of his supporters...

51
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:34,985
and that in all those 20 years, his
program never needed to be modified.

52
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,866
I suggest we try it again.

53
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:08,254
I did it.
He hired me.

54
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:30,130
Two and a half years later.
Berlin - 20 April 1945, Hitler's 56th birthday.

55
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,230
Take cover.

56
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:39,321
Hurry. Continue.
Get that off the street.

57
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,919
Take cover.

58
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:57,503
That's artillery fire.

59
00:06:57,603 --> 00:07:01,599
Don't be silly.
Where would it be coming from?

60
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:05,895
You're right. These are no planes,
this is artillery.

61
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:10,490
It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.

62
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:17,284
Where is that cannon fire coming from?

63
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:19,881
Happy Birthday,
mein Führer.

64
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,777
The city centre of Berlin is under fire.

65
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,773
Grenades have hit near the
Brandenburger Tor and the Reichstag.

66
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:30,870
Where did they come from?
- We don't know yet.

67
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,467
I have Koller on the line.
- Give me Koller.

68
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:38,817
Koller, do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?

69
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,666
No.
- Can't you hear the shooting?

70
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,455
No, I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
- Berlin is chaotic.

71
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:50,151
Apparently, the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

72
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:53,747
The enemy has no railway artillery near the Oder.

73
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,845
It's not long-range artillery.

74
00:07:55,945 --> 00:08:01,040
The anti-aircraft defence near the
Zoo-Bunker reports they're 10 to 12...

75
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,645
cm calibres. The Russians have
positions near Marzahn.

76
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:10,930
That's only 12 kilometres from the
centre. Are the Russians that close?

77
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,195
They should hang the entire Luftwaffe leadership.

78
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:18,823
This is unheard-of.

79
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:22,918
The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.

80
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:26,163
Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.

81
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,712
Maybe it's long-range artillery,
after all.

82
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:33,807
That railway bridge over the Oder...
- Nonsense.

83
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:42,262
That Himmler,
such a pompous buffoon.

84
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,794
Party bosses, everywhere.
They make me so sick.

85
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,688
The Führer starts 'Clausewitz' today.

86
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:57,884
Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.

87
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:01,480
If the Führer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.

88
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,320
We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.

89
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:09,273
He's the only diplomat with any influence on him.

90
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:12,433
Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.

91
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,874
Talk to your sister-in-law, then.

92
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:21,161
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

93
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,457
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

94
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:29,053
You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.

95
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,638
Do you want to die here?
- Absolutely not.

96
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:39,045
Gentlemen, the Führer.

97
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:54,267
Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

98
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:04,818
What's going on?
- We're leaving.

99
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:08,913
'Clausewitz' has started.

100
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:13,209
All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.

101
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:17,305
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

102
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:20,902
Don't ask me, professor.
- This is insane.

103
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,784
Professor.

104
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,378
I won't allow the evacuation of my office.

105
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:48,474
Is that so?
- Food supply would collapse.

106
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:52,234
A good soldier can always find food.

107
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,765
And when there's fighting all over the city,
where does he get it? The population.

108
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:02,200
It's irresponsible.
- It's an order from the Führer.

109
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,057
As department head, I
report to the SS and to Himmler.

110
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:10,852
But as a doctor, I'm part of the
Wehrmacht and they're not leaving yet.

111
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:13,350
Keep that in mind.

112
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:23,005
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

113
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:27,438
We're leaving.

114
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:44,008
Everything for Germany.
Heil, mein Führer.

115
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,269
Führer, I...
Heil, mein Führer.

116
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:51,811
They're in such a hurry to get away from here.

117
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,461
The brown nosing is the worst.

118
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:59,864
They say 'Sieg Heil'. but they
think 'Lick my... you know what.'

119
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:07,301
Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.

120
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,995
Too late?

121
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:13,642
Hewel, come here for a moment.

122
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,285
I'm sure you agree we should
contact the Allies...

123
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:24,085
and start conducting politics.
- Certainly. We need politics.

124
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,175
Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.

125
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,873
I'm fed up with it.

126
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:37,661
When I'm dead, you'll have
plenty of time for politics.

127
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:43,460
It's good, dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.

128
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,355
It's good.
Just go.

129
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,975
He has no strength left.

130
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:15,628
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?

131
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:20,063
Seriously, though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

132
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,921
Berlin will fall in a couple of days.

133
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:27,616
When the Führer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?

134
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:31,313
Why do you think they'll negotiate with you?

135
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:35,509
The Nazi state and my SS
are needed to maintain order.

136
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:38,606
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

137
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:43,201
The first contact has been made.
- Careful, that's high treason.

138
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:45,898
Fegelein, I have other concerns.

139
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:50,993
Should I give Eisenhower the
Nazi salute or shake his hand?

140
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:59,787
Look at that.

141
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:04,380
The best guests always arrive late.

142
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,475
Leaving already, gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

143
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:14,779
The scorched-earth order...
- I really have to go now.

144
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,285
Come and see me one day in Hohenlychen.

145
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:25,659
I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.

146
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:40,594
You know, Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

147
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:46,724
It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.

148
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:52,412
When the war will be over,
reconstruction will be quick.

149
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:58,427
We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.

150
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:03,222
You're a true genius, Speer.

151
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,114
Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know that
the Third Reich would be inconceivable...

152
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:16,144
with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

153
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:21,504
This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture...

154
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:24,601
that will survive thousands of years.

155
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:29,291
We see, before us, the ancient
cities, the Acropolis...

156
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,193
We see the medieval cities...
the cathedrals...

157
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:36,789
and we know that the people need that.

158
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:42,683
Indeed, Speer.

159
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,380
That was my vision...

160
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:51,474
and it still is.

161
00:15:54,171 --> 00:16:00,121
Mein Führer, if you want to realize
these plans, you must leave Berlin.

162
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,658
Eva, you say something.

163
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:11,402
He's the Führer.
He knows what's best.

164
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:16,969
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

165
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:19,359
I can't do that, my child.

166
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:25,141
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

167
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,735
I have to solve the problem,
here in Berlin, or perish.

168
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,533
Speer...

169
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,230
what do you think?

170
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:43,577
You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.

171
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:02,805
Reload.

172
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:14,334
Go away. Leave me alone.

173
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:18,561
How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?

174
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:22,572
Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.

175
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:26,779
Who are you? What do you want?
I want my son. Alive.

176
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,534
You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.

177
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:34,072
The Führer will decorate him for it, today.

178
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:38,252
You're still young.
At which front did you fight?

179
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:40,366
I haven't had the honour yet.

180
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:44,961
Count yourself lucky.
Send the children home.

181
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,658
We'll defend this position to the last man.

182
00:17:48,758 --> 00:17:52,854
Which position?
This is not a position, it's a trap.

183
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:56,550
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

184
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,115
We'll shoot back.
- What with?

185
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,745
With the anti-aircraft guns.

186
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:05,841
The Russians will arrive with several
armies, tanks and heavy artillery.

187
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:10,106
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

188
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,134
We promised the Führer.

189
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,978
Don't you understand?
The war is lost.

190
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,429
Coward.

191
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:25,124
Go away. Right now.

192
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,345
If you're still here when the Russians
arrive, you'll all be dead.

193
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:40,107
The 9th army had to retreat
or they would have been decimated...

194
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:46,261
We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.

195
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,490
Führer, then the 9th army is lost.

196
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:54,692
We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east...

197
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:59,488
with a ruthless, mighty attack.

198
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,686
Using which units?

199
00:19:02,784 --> 00:19:07,544
Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th army.

200
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:12,213
The 9th army is unable to move.

201
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:15,565
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

202
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:18,831
Wenck's 12th army must support them.

203
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:24,393
The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
- Then it must turn around.

204
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,258
Then the western front would be open.
- Do you doubt my orders?

205
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:32,855
I think I've been clear enough.

206
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:41,546
The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.

207
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:47,190
We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.

208
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:09,318
Mohnke, you're here.
- Mein Führer.

209
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:15,777
Today, 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.

210
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:21,306
You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.

211
00:20:21,406 --> 00:20:25,402
We'll fight until the last man, in Berlin.

212
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:31,696
There are still three million civilians
here. They have to be evacuated.

213
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:37,790
I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.

214
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:42,754
We can't spend any energy on so-called civilians.

215
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:48,380
With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children...

216
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,476
and the thousands of wounded and elderly?

217
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:55,741
In a war such as this one,
there are no civilians.

218
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,769
The Führer has lost all sense of reality.

219
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:02,466
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

220
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:08,160
Gruppe Steiner has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

221
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,356
But why don't you tell him that?
- He doesn't listen to reason.

222
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:17,556
Something has to happen.
- Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

223
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:22,746
We're soldiers.
We took an oath.

224
00:21:22,845 --> 00:21:25,842
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

225
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:30,022
And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?

226
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:32,138
I beg your pardon?

227
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:59,727
Where were you?
- None of your business.

228
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:13,946
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.

229
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:22,888
I'm proud of you.

230
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:29,833
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

231
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,774
His name is Peter Kranz.
- So you're Peter.

232
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:40,568
I wish my generals were as brave as you.

233
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,559
Very good.

234
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:00,151
You've made history.

235
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:05,244
And when Germania will rise from these ruins...

236
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:07,943
you will be the heroes.

237
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Heil, to you.

238
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:45,404
I don't know about you,
but I prefer air raids.

239
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:51,099
What will happen to us?
- I could go if I wanted to.

240
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:56,473
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go, can we?

241
00:23:56,993 --> 00:23:58,993
I can't go either.

242
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:06,783
I wouldn't know where to go.

243
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:11,978
My parents and all my friends warned me.

244
00:24:12,677 --> 00:24:15,567
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

245
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:18,571
What should I say: 'Hello, I made a mistake'?

246
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:22,666
'When things went wrong,
I admitted my mistake.'

247
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:26,064
Life will go on.

248
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:38,650
What do you think, Herr Oberst?
- We have to go.

249
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:43,846
Go where?
- I don't know.

250
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:46,546
Wherever they need us.

251
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:01,029
Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.

252
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:03,729
Come on.

253
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:08,424
Come, children.

254
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:17,213
We should have fun today.

255
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:28,202
Wherever the enemy goes,
all they find is destruction.

256
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:33,481
That's the death sentence for the German people.

257
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:38,192
No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no traffic.

258
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:44,786
If you destroy everything, our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.

259
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:49,681
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

260
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:54,376
If the war is lost, what does it
matter that the people are lost too?

261
00:25:54,476 --> 00:26:00,570
The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant, right now.

262
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,266
On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.

263
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,864
Our people turned out weak...

264
00:26:07,463 --> 00:26:11,559
and according to the laws of nature,
they should die out.

265
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:15,059
They're your people.
You're their Führer.

266
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:18,061
What remains after this battle...

267
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:22,848
is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

268
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:33,637
Come along. You have to dance.

269
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:38,077
Care to dance, Fräulein Braun?
- I'd love to.

270
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:05,108
May I?
- Go ahead.

271
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:08,205
What's wrong?

272
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:16,834
We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.

273
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,792
Or else, come with me.

274
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,781
You'll die.

275
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:56,655
Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.

276
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,755
Dance.

277
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,775
Do you have a request?
- As long as it swings.

278
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Traudl.

279
00:28:39,912 --> 00:28:42,310
It's all so unreal.

280
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:48,504
It's like a dream you can't get out of.

281
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:51,303
It keeps on going.

282
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:57,595
Gerda, I don't feel well.

283
00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:36,059
Traudl, come.

284
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:57,737
I did not move...

285
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:01,969
I did not move my command post.

286
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,330
To the west? How so?

287
00:30:06,426 --> 00:30:10,251
I'm at 1,000 meters from the enemy.
- General.

288
00:30:29,604 --> 00:30:31,604
And, general?

289
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:34,698
I'll be executed.
- What? Why?

290
00:30:35,897 --> 00:30:39,893
They think I moved my command post to the west.

291
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:43,982
Be sensible, general.
- Come along.

292
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:03,272
Schenck.
- Mohnke.

293
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,385
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.

294
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:13,160
I need help.
- That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

295
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,257
My assistant and I are the only ones here.

296
00:31:16,357 --> 00:31:18,855
You're a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes, an internist.

297
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:23,035
Commandeer a car and bring all the medication...

298
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,147
you can find, to me.

299
00:31:26,747 --> 00:31:29,744
I'll do my best.
- Thanks. Hurry.

300
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:22,459
I need to talk to the Führer.

301
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:26,687
What about?
- I'm going to be executed.

302
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,384
Wait here.

303
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:35,081
Your weapon, please.

304
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:43,173
Not here.

305
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:49,465
Guard post 2.
Understood.

306
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,763
General...

307
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:57,859
Not you.

308
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:23,931
What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?

309
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:28,626
You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.

310
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:33,222
Officers who don't obey,
must be executed.

311
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:38,096
What do you mean? My troops
have been fighting for days.

312
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:42,792
My command post is a kilometre
away from the front line.

313
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,211
Continue.

314
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:49,241
Do you see this? I don't want you
to use that tone with me.

315
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:53,919
And now, do whatever you feel you must.

316
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:59,386
It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.

317
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:17,877
You can't pass, Oberst.
- Orders from brigade führer Mohnke:

318
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:21,474
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

319
00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:24,571
There's nobody left.
They all took off.

320
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:27,731
And the wounded?
- How should I know?

321
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,965
I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.

322
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:34,145
Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.

323
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,585
See that? That's where the Reich
ends. Behind it, is Russkie land.

324
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:53,142
May I?

325
00:34:59,742 --> 00:35:03,732
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

326
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:09,467
I should have been back by now. Are
you sure the Führer still needs me?

327
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:12,564
Drink.
- Führer's orders.

328
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:16,463
You made a big impression on the Führer.

329
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,257
But you don't think Steiner will attack, do you?

330
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:22,354
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...

331
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:26,050
but you probably know that better than I do.

332
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,635
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin is lost.

333
00:36:38,937 --> 00:36:41,435
The Führer was impressed with your report.

334
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:45,615
He puts you in command of the defence of Berlin.

335
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,225
I'd have preferred it if he executed me.

336
00:37:12,404 --> 00:37:14,404
Let them get closer.

337
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,399
Tank alert.

338
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:22,095
Take it easy. Wait, kid.
They're still too far.

339
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:16,141
Is it German artillery that I hear?
- I'm afraid not.

340
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:19,301
But hasn't Steiner's attack started?

341
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:24,932
You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.

342
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:28,129
But the Führer has the situation under control.

343
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:30,727
Steiner will make all the difference.

344
00:38:30,827 --> 00:38:34,227
He says it will change military history.

345
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:38,588
Everybody, but the Führer, knows
that's a fantasy.

346
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:44,213
I even wonder if he believes it himself.
- Why would he be playing games?

347
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:46,523
What does he have to lose?

348
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,508
I don't believe a word of it.

349
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:52,158
The enemy made a breakthrough.

350
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,801
They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.

351
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:00,897
They're at the northern city border,
between Frohnau and Pankow.

352
00:39:00,997 --> 00:39:06,352
In the east, they reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

353
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:10,701
If Steiner attacks,
everything will be alright.

354
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,484
Mein Führer...

355
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:18,681
Steiner...

356
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:22,583
Steiner didn't have enough force.

357
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,372
The attack didn't take place.

358
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:47,251
The following stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

359
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:07,131
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

360
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,926
How dare you ignore my orders?

361
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:16,622
Is this what it came to?

362
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,315
The military, everybody lied to me. Even the SS.

363
00:40:24,014 --> 00:40:29,009
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

364
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:31,809
I don't allow that...

365
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:37,501
Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
- Führer, this is outrageous.

366
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,596
The generals are the scum of the German people.

367
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:44,294
No sense of honour.

368
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:49,988
You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy...

369
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:53,085
where you only learnt to use knife and fork.

370
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:57,181
For years, the military obstructed me.

371
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:01,877
All you ever did is thwart me.

372
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:05,773
I should have had...

373
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:10,968
all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

374
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:18,360
I never went to the academy.

375
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,954
But I conquered all of Europe on my own.

376
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:31,949
Traitors.

377
00:41:32,047 --> 00:41:36,642
I've been betrayed and deceived from the start.

378
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:41,837
Such enormous betrayal of the German people.

379
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:48,131
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

380
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,205
They will drown in their own blood.

381
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,925
Calm, Gerda.

382
00:42:03,016 --> 00:42:06,513
All my orders have been ignored.

383
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:12,291
How can I be a leader under these circumstances?

384
00:42:14,105 --> 00:42:16,105
It's over.

385
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:23,196
The war is lost.

386
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,470
But if you think this means I'll leave Berlin...

387
00:42:33,486 --> 00:42:38,161
you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

388
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,477
Do what you want.

389
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:09,450
The Führer wasn't serious about
killing himself, was he?

390
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,048
Frau Junge, Frau Christian.

391
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:20,349
Get changed. In one hour,
a plane will take you south.

392
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:24,038
Everything is lost.

393
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,535
Completely lost.

394
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,765
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

395
00:43:46,314 --> 00:43:48,779
I'm staying too, mein Führer.

396
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:14,887
Now what?

397
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,110
Time to end this charade.

398
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:22,088
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

399
00:44:22,278 --> 00:44:27,872
The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

400
00:44:27,972 --> 00:44:32,068
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.

401
00:44:32,168 --> 00:44:35,483
Nobody can replace him.
He's the Führer.

402
00:44:35,865 --> 00:44:38,925
The Führer's confused.
He'll recover.

403
00:44:38,962 --> 00:44:41,459
Great. And then what?

404
00:44:44,156 --> 00:44:48,066
No capitulation. That was never his intention.

405
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,242
We owe it to him.
- Hollow phrases.

406
00:44:51,449 --> 00:44:54,446
We have to act now.
Or it will be too late.

407
00:44:54,546 --> 00:44:59,051
You're only looking after yourself.
- Mind your words.

408
00:45:06,434 --> 00:45:08,434
Damn.

409
00:45:12,728 --> 00:45:16,808
We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.

410
00:45:17,324 --> 00:45:18,822
We've got to wait.

411
00:45:18,922 --> 00:45:23,018
Even the Führer doesn't believe in
it anymore. What will happen to us?

412
00:45:23,118 --> 00:45:28,213
Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

413
00:45:28,313 --> 00:45:31,310
Why did you say you wanted to stay with him?

414
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,806
I don't know.
Honestly.

415
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:40,338
It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.

416
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Traudl.

417
00:46:24,057 --> 00:46:26,057
Look here.

418
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:50,531
I'm lighting another one.

419
00:47:08,513 --> 00:47:11,011
Let's go down again.

420
00:47:41,181 --> 00:47:45,676
Where do they come from?
- Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

421
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:49,346
They have to get out of the field of fire.

422
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:57,000
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

423
00:47:59,363 --> 00:48:03,528
I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.

424
00:48:04,058 --> 00:48:06,523
I'll take the responsibility.

425
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:20,242
I think this is wrong.
- Great.

426
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,941
Stop. Lights out.

427
00:48:24,038 --> 00:48:26,536
Stop. Stay where you are.

428
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:30,365
Stay where you are.
- Alright, Germans.

429
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:38,324
Help. They want to kill us.
- What is all this?

430
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:42,520
A Greifkommando.
- You're kidding.

431
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,607
Stop it. Let those men go.

432
00:48:56,207 --> 00:48:59,522
What's this?
You have no authority here.

433
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:04,398
These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.

434
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:08,923
They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.

435
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:16,294
Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?

436
00:49:18,185 --> 00:49:20,185
Stop it. That's enough.

437
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:36,269
Dismissed.

438
00:51:19,365 --> 00:51:21,365
This man's a doctor.

439
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:31,253
Can you operate?
- Not really.

440
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,446
Don't let the children take too many toys.

441
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:42,741
And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.

442
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:46,338
Herr Minister...
- Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.

443
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:50,518
Can you look after them for a moment? Thank you.

444
00:51:51,133 --> 00:51:53,131
Brigade führer,
what can I do for you?

445
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:56,728
Your Volkssturm is an easy prey for the Russians.

446
00:51:56,828 --> 00:51:59,924
They have neither combat
experience nor good weapons.

447
00:52:00,024 --> 00:52:05,119
Their unconditional belief in the
final victory makes up for that.

448
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:09,715
Herr Minister, without weapons
these men can't fight.

449
00:52:10,414 --> 00:52:12,412
Their deaths will be pointless.

450
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:15,010
I don't pity them.

451
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:19,205
I repeat: I don't pity them.

452
00:52:19,805 --> 00:52:23,120
The people called this upon themselves.

453
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:27,497
This may come as a surprise
to you. Don't fool yourself.

454
00:52:27,597 --> 00:52:31,193
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

455
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:34,790
And now they're paying for it.

456
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:54,763
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

457
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,567
Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.

458
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,642
How can you say that?
Where are you?

459
00:53:00,864 --> 00:53:03,499
I decided not to die in Berlin.

460
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:09,996
Does my sister know where you are?
- Think about it. I'll call you back.

461
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:13,714
Children, your room is to the right.

462
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,450
Wait for me.

463
00:53:18,547 --> 00:53:22,882
Hello, Frau Goebbels.
- Good to see you, Frau Junge.

464
00:53:34,631 --> 00:53:36,631
Line up, children.

465
00:53:37,128 --> 00:53:39,128
Helga, come. Line up.

466
00:53:40,225 --> 00:53:46,260
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.

467
00:53:49,216 --> 00:53:51,341
Do you remember the song?

468
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:35,465
The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.

469
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:43,332
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.

470
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:46,359
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

471
00:54:46,459 --> 00:54:50,114
If I have to die,
at least without any pain.

472
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,054
That's definitely painless.

473
00:54:52,154 --> 00:54:57,084
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

474
00:54:57,449 --> 00:54:59,449
A matter of seconds.

475
00:55:01,045 --> 00:55:04,042
Can I have one too?
- Me too.

476
00:55:09,337 --> 00:55:13,832
Himmler provided me well.

477
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:33,914
Thank you.

478
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:39,507
I would have liked to give you a nicer present.

479
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,595
Berlin, 23 April 1945.

480
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:00,386
Dear sister. I'm sorry to write you this.

481
00:56:01,185 --> 00:56:05,681
But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

482
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,440
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

483
00:56:09,977 --> 00:56:13,473
But I'm sure you'll see him again.

484
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:19,168
He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.

485
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:23,522
The Führer lost all hope of a good outcome.

486
00:56:25,062 --> 00:56:29,482
Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.

487
00:56:29,757 --> 00:56:34,432
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

488
00:56:35,052 --> 00:56:38,548
I stayed with daddy against his will.

489
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:42,744
Last Sunday, the Führer wanted to help me escape.

490
00:56:42,844 --> 00:56:45,841
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

491
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:50,037
I won't even think about it. Our
ideology's going down the drain...

492
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:55,492
and with it, everything that made
life beautiful and worthwhile.

493
00:56:55,831 --> 00:57:00,926
After the Führer and National Socialism,
there's nothing left to live for.

494
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:04,123
That's why I brought the children too.

495
00:57:04,223 --> 00:57:06,720
They're too good for the life that awaits them.

496
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:11,835
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

497
00:57:19,308 --> 00:57:23,903
I'll wear my bracelet with the
green stone until the very end.

498
00:57:24,003 --> 00:57:28,998
After that, I want you to always wear it.

499
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:34,792
Unfortunately, my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.

500
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:39,987
I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

501
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:42,087
I want you to get it.

502
00:57:43,284 --> 00:57:47,280
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

503
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,355
A birthday present from the Führer.

504
00:57:51,576 --> 00:57:55,072
I owe some money to the Heise company.

505
00:57:56,271 --> 00:58:01,286
There may be more debts, but
no more than 1,500 Reichsmarks.

506
00:58:02,765 --> 00:58:08,759
All correspondence with the Führer must be burnt.

507
00:58:11,057 --> 00:58:17,650
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.

508
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:24,210
The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for daddy, the chocolate for mummy.

509
00:58:24,244 --> 00:58:28,739
I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.

510
00:58:29,938 --> 00:58:33,508
Dear sister, I wish you lots of happiness.

511
00:58:33,934 --> 00:58:37,530
And remember,
you will see Hermann again.

512
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:41,726
The warmest regards and a kiss from...

513
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:44,326
your sister.

514
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,573
Inge.

515
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:32,117
Listen, Keitel.
I want you to leave this evening.

516
01:00:32,816 --> 01:00:36,896
Go to Dönitz and help him with the organisation.

517
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:40,009
Things have to be started up again.

518
01:00:41,707 --> 01:00:43,707
I don't understand you.

519
01:00:44,305 --> 01:00:48,300
We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.

520
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:53,995
It makes any serious operation impossible.

521
01:00:54,195 --> 01:01:00,688
When everything has been solved
here, we must get the oil fields back.

522
01:01:05,684 --> 01:01:08,681
Any questions?
- No, mein Führer.

523
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,777
Good.
Have a good trip.

524
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:41,389
Mein Führer! Is it agreeable to
you after your decision...

525
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:44,885
to remain in the fortified zone of
Berlin as your representative...

526
01:02:44,985 --> 01:02:48,482
do you agree that I take charge...

527
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:52,178
with complete freedom of action?

528
01:02:52,877 --> 01:02:55,375
If I receive no reply by 22:00 hours...

529
01:02:55,475 --> 01:02:58,875
I'll assume you have been incapacitated.

530
01:02:58,971 --> 01:03:03,567
I will then act on behalf of
the country and the motherland.

531
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:06,664
That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.

532
01:03:06,764 --> 01:03:09,860
Göring's concerns are not entirely unjustified.

533
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,020
If our communication system fails...

534
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:16,957
we'll be cut off from the outside world.

535
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:19,751
We won't be able to issue orders anymore.

536
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:23,251
I think Göring wants to seize the power.

537
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:27,043
I never trusted his clique on the Obersalzberg.

538
01:03:27,143 --> 01:03:29,041
This looks like a coup.

539
01:03:29,141 --> 01:03:32,638
The loser, the sponger.

540
01:03:33,337 --> 01:03:35,835
A parvenu, a lazy bastard.

541
01:03:37,133 --> 01:03:41,629
How dare he say I'm incapacitated?

542
01:03:42,828 --> 01:03:45,888
Hello.
- How did you get into Berlin?

543
01:03:46,524 --> 01:03:50,021
It wasn't easy,
but I must speak to the Führer.

544
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:52,586
If I were you,
I'd wait a bit.

545
01:03:52,718 --> 01:03:56,203
The Luftwaffe.
What did he turn that into?

546
01:03:56,414 --> 01:03:59,559
For that alone,
he should be executed.

547
01:04:00,011 --> 01:04:05,505
This morphine addict corrupted the country.

548
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:08,804
And now this.

549
01:04:09,401 --> 01:04:11,899
He's betraying me.

550
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:16,594
Me of all people.

551
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:27,774
I want Göring stripped of his power, right away.

552
01:04:28,183 --> 01:04:31,180
And, in case I don't survive the war...

553
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,277
he must be executed immediately.

554
01:04:36,974 --> 01:04:41,394
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

555
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:47,364
Frau Junge, leave from here before it's too late.

556
01:04:47,464 --> 01:04:51,460
The Führer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind, can we?

557
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:57,085
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.

558
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:03,283
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.

559
01:05:11,939 --> 01:05:13,939
But the children...

560
01:05:17,634 --> 01:05:19,759
I have always believed...

561
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,227
that there was a way out.

562
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,120
Come in.

563
01:05:35,316 --> 01:05:37,316
Albert. Hello.

564
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,903
You have a fever.

565
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,497
Albert, I can't stand it anymore.

566
01:05:56,695 --> 01:05:59,692
Why don't you leave with the children, Magda?

567
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:02,290
Leave?
And go where?

568
01:06:02,989 --> 01:06:08,089
I can arrange for you to be
taken to Schwanenwerder by barge.

569
01:06:08,184 --> 01:06:11,680
You can hide until everything's over.

570
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,660
It won't be long now anyway.

571
01:06:14,877 --> 01:06:16,877
I thought about it.

572
01:06:18,573 --> 01:06:24,013
My children cannot grow up in a
world without National Socialism.

573
01:06:26,865 --> 01:06:31,370
Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.

574
01:06:35,756 --> 01:06:40,252
If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.

575
01:06:56,935 --> 01:07:00,080
I can't believe you really want that.

576
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:04,128
Go now.

577
01:07:34,998 --> 01:07:36,998
Come in.

578
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,291
I knew you'd come.

579
01:07:43,889 --> 01:07:46,886
You wouldn't desert the Führer.

580
01:07:51,082 --> 01:07:57,176
I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

581
01:07:57,276 --> 01:07:59,996
Of course, you must go.
Sit down.

582
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,567
I took some furniture you designed.

583
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:08,065
I couldn't leave it behind.

584
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:12,660
Please, you must not have eaten all day.

585
01:08:13,859 --> 01:08:15,859
That's true.

586
01:08:20,153 --> 01:08:25,763
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

587
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:27,847
Did he ever doubt that?

588
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:33,539
Lately, he often thought
you were against him too.

589
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:37,209
I always said you'd come and here you are.

590
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:46,027
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

591
01:08:46,127 --> 01:08:48,127
I also think it's best.

592
01:08:51,422 --> 01:08:53,422
And, you know...

593
01:08:54,519 --> 01:08:56,519
it may sound strange...

594
01:08:58,715 --> 01:09:03,710
but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.

595
01:09:30,683 --> 01:09:35,178
You came.
- Mein Führer, I...

596
01:09:35,478 --> 01:09:37,478
It's good.

597
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:40,975
Let's sit down.

598
01:09:58,455 --> 01:10:03,450
I had great plans for the Germans and the world.

599
01:10:05,249 --> 01:10:10,244
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

600
01:10:14,639 --> 01:10:20,633
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

601
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,930
Too late.

602
01:10:31,722 --> 01:10:36,717
I can only be proud for openly
fighting the Jews...

603
01:10:38,516 --> 01:10:43,191
and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.

604
01:10:47,307 --> 01:10:51,403
I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment...

605
01:10:51,503 --> 01:11:01,493
and then eternal peace.

606
01:11:06,088 --> 01:11:10,284
But please spare the people,
mein Führer.

607
01:11:10,584 --> 01:11:14,780
If my people cannot endure this ordeal...

608
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,877
I won't shed a tear.

609
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:20,871
They get what they deserve.

610
01:11:21,173 --> 01:11:26,668
They called this fate upon themselves.

611
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,163
For months...

612
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:37,969
I have to tell you this...

613
01:11:39,455 --> 01:11:44,130
for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

614
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:51,643
I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.

615
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:59,138
I had to tell you.

616
01:12:07,927 --> 01:12:12,092
This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.

617
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,807
So you're leaving.

618
01:12:29,206 --> 01:12:31,206
Good.

619
01:12:31,304 --> 01:12:33,304
Goodbye.

620
01:12:44,391 --> 01:12:46,431
I wish you all the best.

621
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,964
Eat well, gentlemen.

622
01:14:07,808 --> 01:14:09,808
Peter.

623
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:20,995
It's alright, son.

624
01:14:37,878 --> 01:14:39,878
He has a fever.

625
01:14:41,575 --> 01:14:43,575
Yes, but he's alive.

626
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:11,545
Loyalty and courage still exist in this world.

627
01:15:12,144 --> 01:15:16,309
Ritter von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch, how good...

628
01:15:18,338 --> 01:15:22,588
that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

629
01:15:23,533 --> 01:15:25,533
Sit down.

630
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:29,727
We came under heavy fire, but
still arrived in Gatow.

631
01:15:29,827 --> 01:15:32,547
From there,
we couldn't continue.

632
01:15:33,523 --> 01:15:38,113
We flew in a Fieseler Storch,
over the Russian lines...

633
01:15:38,818 --> 01:15:41,715
and landed on the East-West axis, close to here.

634
01:15:41,815 --> 01:15:45,470
Before landing, the Soviets had a go at us.

635
01:15:46,111 --> 01:15:51,705
General Von Greim, I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.

636
01:15:51,805 --> 01:15:55,501
I hereby promote you to General-Feldmarschall.

637
01:15:55,601 --> 01:15:58,598
A big responsibility rests on your shoulders.

638
01:15:58,698 --> 01:16:02,195
You have to rebuild the Luftwaffe from scratch.

639
01:16:02,295 --> 01:16:05,780
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

640
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:09,488
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

641
01:16:11,685 --> 01:16:17,180
This so-called humanity is religious drivel.

642
01:16:18,978 --> 01:16:24,333
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...

643
01:16:24,772 --> 01:16:26,812
is a betrayal of nature.

644
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:32,365
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

645
01:16:33,064 --> 01:16:37,314
Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.

646
01:16:40,857 --> 01:16:45,277
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...

647
01:16:45,452 --> 01:16:49,872
opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

648
01:16:51,746 --> 01:16:53,746
Apes, for instance...

649
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:59,338
kill all the odd ones.

650
01:17:00,038 --> 01:17:05,532
And what applies to apes,
must definitely apply to humans.

651
01:17:12,026 --> 01:17:14,123
Himmler made an offer to surrender...

652
01:17:14,223 --> 01:17:19,618
to the allied powers.

653
01:17:20,317 --> 01:17:22,317
Via Count Bernadotte.

654
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,819
A message from the English radio.

655
01:17:31,307 --> 01:17:36,302
Himmler.
Himmler of all people.

656
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:44,493
The most loyal of my loyals.
That's the worst betrayal.

657
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:52,585
Göring, he was corrupt.
Always has been.

658
01:17:52,885 --> 01:17:59,579
Speer, an absent-minded artist.
All the others: yes.

659
01:17:59,878 --> 01:18:05,872
But Himmler?
Has he gone insane?

660
01:18:06,572 --> 01:18:10,568
He must have told them I'm sick.

661
01:18:11,267 --> 01:18:13,267
Maybe even dead.

662
01:18:19,659 --> 01:18:24,504
Leave me alone with Ritter Von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch.

663
01:18:25,852 --> 01:18:30,348
And get Fegelein.
- We don't know where he is.

664
01:18:31,047 --> 01:18:34,644
What? He's Himmler's assistant.
He must be available.

665
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:39,759
We haven't seen him for days.
- I want a report immediately.

666
01:18:42,536 --> 01:18:44,661
Please stay here, Doctor.

667
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:53,525
You and Greim must go as quickly
as possible. Fly to Dönitz.

668
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:59,519
Tell him to do anything
it takes to punish Himmler.

669
01:19:00,218 --> 01:19:04,214
We've decided to die with you.

670
01:19:07,012 --> 01:19:10,072
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

671
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:14,778
But Himmler must die.
He committed treason.

672
01:19:14,904 --> 01:19:19,299
He's no longer privvy to my plans.

673
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:21,497
Mein Führer?

674
01:19:21,597 --> 01:19:25,693
Do you think I'll sit and wait until
those Jewish swine slaughter me?

675
01:19:25,793 --> 01:19:29,989
This is part of a huge decoy operation.
I've allowed the enemy...

676
01:19:30,089 --> 01:19:34,984
to invade the Reich and they think they've won.

677
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:39,180
But mark my words: they have
another thing coming.

678
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,875
Dönitz is mobilising in the north.
Kesselring in the south.

679
01:19:43,975 --> 01:19:47,971
We'll surround the enemy and crush them.

680
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:54,365
From Prague, three armies will attack the
Russians, simultaneously, from the back.

681
01:19:54,465 --> 01:19:59,460
I didn't know we still had
so many reserve troops.

682
01:20:00,658 --> 01:20:04,355
I made sure you'll soon have
a 1,000 of the most modern...

683
01:20:04,455 --> 01:20:08,351
jets at your disposal.

684
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:13,546
With those, you can make the
Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

685
01:20:13,646 --> 01:20:18,236
I kneel to your genius, at the
altar of the motherland.

686
01:20:33,326 --> 01:20:35,326
Heil, mein Führer.

687
01:20:37,922 --> 01:20:40,919
You also request to leave Berlin?

688
01:20:42,617 --> 01:20:46,952
Mein Führer, as you know,
all medical departments...

689
01:20:47,312 --> 01:20:51,408
that fall under the SS and Himmler,
have left Berlin.

690
01:20:51,508 --> 01:20:55,588
Himmler is a traitor.
He won't escape punishment.

691
01:20:56,203 --> 01:21:00,899
Mein Führer, as Reichsarzt SS,
I have no more work here.

692
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:05,923
Your request to leave Berlin is unacceptable.

693
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:09,292
My family...

694
01:21:10,989 --> 01:21:13,986
If the Russians...
I must leave.

695
01:21:14,585 --> 01:21:16,585
You did nothing wrong.

696
01:21:17,283 --> 01:21:22,278
Future generations will thank you
for you medical research.

697
01:21:22,977 --> 01:21:25,527
I take all the responsibility.

698
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:33,766
We'll talk about it later.

699
01:21:48,152 --> 01:21:52,847
Gruppenführer Fegelein cannot
be found. He's not in the bunker.

700
01:21:52,947 --> 01:21:55,497
What, you can't find Fegelein?

701
01:21:56,544 --> 01:22:00,794
Keep searching.
I need to talk to him. Immediately.

702
01:22:01,738 --> 01:22:06,158
If he left just like that,
that's desertion. Treason.

703
01:22:06,534 --> 01:22:08,534
Bring me Fegelein.

704
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:11,029
Fegelein. Fegelein.

705
01:22:22,618 --> 01:22:26,613
Daddy, why are you wearing your Sunday uniform?

706
01:22:28,912 --> 01:22:33,407
Ernst, is something wrong?
- No.

707
01:22:34,106 --> 01:22:36,106
Thank you.

708
01:22:36,204 --> 01:22:38,204
Brigitte is hungry too.

709
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:43,297
Ilse, you should eat something as well.

710
01:22:45,595 --> 01:22:47,720
Thank you.
- There you go.

711
01:22:52,388 --> 01:22:54,388
Thank you.

712
01:23:47,933 --> 01:23:52,013
What is it?
- Gruppenführer, you're under arrest.

713
01:23:52,629 --> 01:23:54,626
What?
- You're suspected of desertion.

714
01:23:54,726 --> 01:23:57,446
Get dressed.
You'll come with us.

715
01:24:02,019 --> 01:24:04,019
Search the room.

716
01:24:04,117 --> 01:24:07,347
Let go of me.
You can't give me orders.

717
01:24:09,312 --> 01:24:12,797
You can't have Hermann executed, can you?

718
01:24:13,008 --> 01:24:16,205
There's no doubt.
He wanted to flee.

719
01:24:16,405 --> 01:24:19,635
What does it matter?
Everything's over.

720
01:24:20,801 --> 01:24:23,298
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant by Hermann.

721
01:24:23,398 --> 01:24:27,138
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

722
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:35,186
There's no mercy for traitors.
No compassion for them.

723
01:24:37,484 --> 01:24:40,799
He'll be court-martialled and executed.

724
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,705
What's the point of that?

725
01:24:45,776 --> 01:24:47,776
It is my wish.

726
01:25:01,161 --> 01:25:03,161
You're the Führer.

727
01:25:06,056 --> 01:25:07,554
Speak.

728
01:25:07,654 --> 01:25:10,651
The Russians are advancing more and more.

729
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:14,347
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.

730
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:17,932
There is no ammunition coming in anymore.

731
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:24,238
In the north, the Russians are standing
in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

732
01:25:24,338 --> 01:25:27,834
In the east: Lustgarten.
South: Potsdammer Platz.

733
01:25:27,934 --> 01:25:32,529
West: Tiergarten, about 400 metres
away from the chancellery.

734
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:36,539
How long can you hold out?
- At most, two days.

735
01:25:36,825 --> 01:25:39,885
Including the government area?
- Yes.

736
01:25:40,522 --> 01:25:45,517
As a soldier, I suggest we
flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

737
01:25:46,216 --> 01:25:52,210
The battle of Berlin killed about
20,000 of our best officers.

738
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:55,906
That's what young people are for.

739
01:25:57,105 --> 01:26:00,335
What you suggest is insane.
Ridiculous.

740
01:26:00,801 --> 01:26:03,798
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them.

741
01:26:03,898 --> 01:26:08,993
Mein Führer, the orders have
been written. I give you my word...

742
01:26:09,093 --> 01:26:14,188
The Führer cannot make a honourless
disappearance from world history.

743
01:26:14,288 --> 01:26:18,284
Even if an advance is successful...

744
01:26:18,983 --> 01:26:22,580
I'll end up in another troublesome situation.

745
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:27,675
I'd have to stay in the open air or on a farm...

746
01:26:28,374 --> 01:26:30,374
and wait for the end.

747
01:26:31,471 --> 01:26:36,966
Wenck is advancing with the
12th army. He can join the 9th...

748
01:26:37,565 --> 01:26:41,561
and give the Russians the final blow.

749
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:47,050
Wenck's an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:

750
01:26:49,753 --> 01:26:56,298
Immediately report to me the following:
1. Where are Wenck's vanguard located?

751
01:26:56,546 --> 01:26:59,181
2. When will they attack again?

752
01:27:00,143 --> 01:27:05,838
3. Where is the 9th army?
4. Where will the 9th make a breakthrough?

753
01:27:07,935 --> 01:27:12,430
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be right.

754
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:15,727
Wenck will come.

755
01:27:22,221 --> 01:27:24,221
Wenck will come.

756
01:27:37,606 --> 01:27:41,602
I want to know if Wenck can do anything at all.

757
01:27:42,201 --> 01:27:46,697
It's unlikely that Wenck's
small amount of troops...

758
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:52,591
What's unlikely about the offensive?
- Wenck can't do anything anymore.

759
01:27:52,691 --> 01:27:57,286
Then why don't you tell the Führer
that? Has everybody gone mad?

760
01:27:57,386 --> 01:28:00,882
Do you think the Führer doesn't
know? He'll never surrender.

761
01:28:00,982 --> 01:28:05,078
And neither will we. I've been
through that once. Never again.

762
01:28:05,178 --> 01:28:07,303
Come along. I have to go.

763
01:28:17,366 --> 01:28:19,366
Stop right there.

764
01:28:30,953 --> 01:28:32,953
Heil Hitler.

765
01:29:21,203 --> 01:29:23,700
Excuse me. I fell asleep.

766
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,020
Did you get some rest, my child?

767
01:29:29,994 --> 01:29:31,994
In shorthand.

768
01:29:38,286 --> 01:29:41,782
My political will.

769
01:29:42,981 --> 01:29:47,976
More than 30 years have passed...

770
01:29:48,176 --> 01:29:52,672
since I made my contribution as a volunteer...

771
01:29:52,871 --> 01:29:56,868
during the first World War.

772
01:29:57,567 --> 01:30:02,562
During those 30 years,
I learnt to think, act and live...

773
01:30:03,261 --> 01:30:06,491
out of love and loyalty for my people.

774
01:30:10,354 --> 01:30:13,924
Excuse me. The shooting.
- Please sit down.

775
01:30:17,747 --> 01:30:20,144
Centuries will pass...

776
01:30:20,944 --> 01:30:25,024
but from the ruins
of our cities and monuments...

777
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:30,434
the hatred of the people...

778
01:30:30,734 --> 01:30:34,330
who did this to us,
will continue to flare up.

779
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:38,426
International Judaism and its allies.

780
01:30:49,715 --> 01:30:51,925
What is it, Herr Minister?

781
01:30:55,509 --> 01:30:59,006
Imagine this. The Führer wants
me to leave Berlin.

782
01:30:59,106 --> 01:31:01,106
He ordered it.

783
01:31:03,302 --> 01:31:07,042
I've never ignored an order from the Führer.

784
01:31:15,589 --> 01:31:21,084
But I will ignore this order.
I'll stay with the Führer.

785
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,080
Please, Frau Junge...

786
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:32,273
I want to dictate my will to you.

787
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:37,468
I'm typing the Führer's will.

788
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:40,567
Good.

789
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:44,261
I understand.
Some other time.

790
01:31:51,554 --> 01:31:56,909
Mein Führer, according to the
racial law I'm obliged to ask you:

791
01:31:57,248 --> 01:32:00,478
Mein Führer, are you of Aryan descent?

792
01:32:04,841 --> 01:32:07,306
Can I see your identity card?

793
01:32:08,537 --> 01:32:12,033
You're talking to the Führer here.
- Alright then.

794
01:32:12,133 --> 01:32:16,298
And you, Fräulein Braun,
are you of Aryan descent?

795
01:32:16,629 --> 01:32:19,626
Then there's nothing to stop us.

796
01:32:20,225 --> 01:32:24,321
I'm asking you now:
Do you, mein Führer, Adolf Hitler...

797
01:32:24,421 --> 01:32:29,416
take Eva Braun, present here,
as your wife? Answer 'yes'.

798
01:32:31,714 --> 01:32:35,810
Do you, Eva Braun, take Führer
Adolf Hitler, present here...

799
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:38,907
as your husband? Answer 'yes'.

800
01:32:40,605 --> 01:32:43,602
Then I declare you man and wife.

801
01:33:22,963 --> 01:33:24,963
Two men here.

802
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:29,654
Everything will be alright.

803
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:34,510
You must go to the Führer right away.
- Now?

804
01:33:53,233 --> 01:33:57,398
How long can we hold out?
- Twenty hours, no more.

805
01:33:58,928 --> 01:34:04,422
The Russians are close. At the
moment, we forced them to stop.

806
01:34:05,221 --> 01:34:10,216
You know, Mohnke. The western
democracies are decadent.

807
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:15,911
They'll succumb to the people from the east.

808
01:34:19,207 --> 01:34:21,705
All the best. Thank you.

809
01:34:22,904 --> 01:34:25,901
It wasn't just for Germany.

810
01:34:45,881 --> 01:34:47,881
A message from Keitel.

811
01:34:51,076 --> 01:34:54,872
1. Wenck's vanguard are
stuck south of Schwielowsee.

812
01:34:54,972 --> 01:34:59,392
2. The 12th army can't continue
the attack on Berlin.

813
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:03,164
3. The 9th army is completely surrounded.

814
01:35:23,244 --> 01:35:28,939
What do we do when the last
ammunition reserves have been exhausted?

815
01:35:29,438 --> 01:35:32,435
I'll never surrender. Never.

816
01:35:34,633 --> 01:35:39,628
I forbid you, and the other
commanders, to surrender.

817
01:35:51,816 --> 01:35:57,310
Listen, Günsche. My wife and I
are going to commit suicide.

818
01:35:58,109 --> 01:36:02,105
I don't want my corpse exposed by the Russians.

819
01:36:02,805 --> 01:36:06,375
I don't want them to get me,
dead or alive.

820
01:36:06,401 --> 01:36:09,898
I want to be burnt and never to be found.

821
01:36:14,193 --> 01:36:17,253
Günsche, I want you to promise me...

822
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:22,885
that you will do all that it takes.

823
01:36:23,584 --> 01:36:25,584
Mein Führer...

824
01:36:25,682 --> 01:36:29,678
this is a terrible order,
but I will execute it.

825
01:36:57,151 --> 01:37:00,148
Kempka.
- Erich, I need 200 litres of petrol.

826
01:37:00,248 --> 01:37:03,744
Are you mad?
Where should I find them?

827
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,569
From the parked vehicles.

828
01:37:07,541 --> 01:37:11,026
What's all that petrol for?
- I can't say.

829
01:37:26,821 --> 01:37:30,221
Come, please.
The Führer wants to see us.

830
01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:43,064
Should I tell the Führer you're indisposed?

831
01:37:43,105 --> 01:37:46,102
It's only my collapsed lung.

832
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,200
I'll die soon anyway.

833
01:38:35,853 --> 01:38:37,853
Excuse me.

834
01:38:50,539 --> 01:38:52,749
Over here, Herr Professor.

835
01:39:01,528 --> 01:39:04,025
One moment, please.

836
01:39:13,316 --> 01:39:15,316
Excuse me.

837
01:39:48,281 --> 01:39:52,277
I'm sorry to interrupt your important work.

838
01:39:52,977 --> 01:39:56,973
Mein Führer, keep faith in the final victory.

839
01:39:57,672 --> 01:40:02,168
Lead us and we shall follow.

840
01:40:06,164 --> 01:40:08,164
Come along.

841
01:40:14,955 --> 01:40:16,955
Join the gang.

842
01:40:19,251 --> 01:40:21,848
Come. Have a drink.

843
01:40:22,947 --> 01:40:27,043
Besides drinking, there's little we can do.
- Do sit down.

844
01:40:27,143 --> 01:40:33,536
That's better. Yes, the
situation is pretty shitty.

845
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:41,628
Can we sit down?
- Please do, Fräulein...

846
01:40:42,128 --> 01:40:46,124
Frau...
- That's Frau Hitler.

847
01:40:49,021 --> 01:40:51,021
It's alright.

848
01:40:52,617 --> 01:40:55,592
A pity we can't go outside anymore.

849
01:40:55,714 --> 01:40:59,029
Only if you want to die a heroic death.

850
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:04,805
Fritz, control yourself a bit.
- Yes. Control.

851
01:41:06,104 --> 01:41:08,104
Take cover.

852
01:41:29,281 --> 01:41:33,277
What are you doing here?
- I have to report to the Führer.

853
01:41:33,377 --> 01:41:35,842
You can't right now.
Sit down.

854
01:41:35,875 --> 01:41:37,875
Sit. Drink.

855
01:41:42,168 --> 01:41:44,166
Let me introduce Frau Hitler.

856
01:41:44,266 --> 01:41:48,601
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.

857
01:41:51,559 --> 01:41:55,214
Excuse me.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

858
01:41:55,255 --> 01:41:57,653
You can use our toilet.

859
01:42:05,645 --> 01:42:10,830
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only hit an optic nerve.

860
01:42:11,339 --> 01:42:15,835
That's why it's good to also take the poison.

861
01:42:16,534 --> 01:42:21,030
When you bite through the capsule,
pull the trigger.

862
01:42:21,729 --> 01:42:23,769
Will I have enough time?

863
01:42:24,826 --> 01:42:29,076
The poison starts working
after one or two seconds.

864
01:42:44,906 --> 01:42:47,404
Tornow, you too.

865
01:42:56,495 --> 01:42:58,495
Come Blondi.

866
01:43:29,762 --> 01:43:32,652
You know, Frau Junge,
I've known...

867
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:36,348
my husband for more than 15 years.

868
01:43:36,555 --> 01:43:41,051
But when I think about it,
I know nothing about him.

869
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:44,215
Even though he likes to talk.

870
01:43:46,945 --> 01:43:51,440
I longed for Berlin,
but he's so different now.

871
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:56,305
He only talks about dogs and vegetarian food now.

872
01:43:56,335 --> 01:43:58,833
I hate Blondi.

873
01:44:00,531 --> 01:44:05,971
I sometimes kick her and Adolf
then wonders why she acts strange.

874
01:44:16,615 --> 01:44:20,865
I think he doesn't want anybody
to really know him.

875
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:26,905
he can be so caring in his private life.

876
01:44:28,603 --> 01:44:33,099
And then he uses that rude language again.

877
01:44:34,398 --> 01:44:37,033
When he's the Führer, you mean?

878
01:44:37,994 --> 01:44:40,991
Come, let's smoke another one.

879
01:45:02,869 --> 01:45:04,869
I'm sorry.

880
01:45:06,566 --> 01:45:10,646
You have so many worries and here I am, whining.

881
01:45:11,761 --> 01:45:16,356
Frau Junge, I'm giving you
this coat as a goodbye present.

882
01:45:16,456 --> 01:45:20,952
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.

883
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:24,648
What a surprise. Thank you.

884
01:45:26,346 --> 01:45:30,341
I just don't know where and when I can wear it.

885
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:34,538
Please, try to get out of here.

886
01:45:36,236 --> 01:45:38,236
Promise me.

887
01:47:07,146 --> 01:47:11,742
Thank you. That was very good,
Fräulein Manziarly.

888
01:47:32,921 --> 01:47:36,917
The time has come. It's finished.

889
01:48:15,778 --> 01:48:19,603
The Führer wants to say goodbye.
Come with me.

890
01:48:49,844 --> 01:48:53,159
You're the bravest mother of the Reich.

891
01:48:53,541 --> 01:48:57,706
Führer, you made me the happiest
woman in Germany.

892
01:49:21,713 --> 01:49:24,093
Salute my beautiful Bavaria.

893
01:49:47,487 --> 01:49:49,985
Children, what are you doing here?

894
01:49:50,085 --> 01:49:53,082
We want to see aunt Eva and uncle Hitler.

895
01:49:53,182 --> 01:49:57,007
Have you eaten anything yet?
- Only breakfast.

896
01:49:58,476 --> 01:50:03,236
Stay here, I'll get something
to eat. I'll be right back.

897
01:50:11,264 --> 01:50:15,759
Comrades, this is the
latest news from the outside.

898
01:50:16,459 --> 01:50:23,004
Berlin is full of warehouses: There were
houses here, there were houses there.

899
01:50:27,148 --> 01:50:30,803
Herr Günsche,
I want to speak to the Führer.

900
01:50:31,344 --> 01:50:33,344
Please, I have to.

901
01:50:33,442 --> 01:50:35,939
Frau Goebbels, the Führer
doesn't want to be disturbed.

902
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:39,036
Please, Günsche,
just for a moment.

903
01:50:39,636 --> 01:50:41,636
Please.

904
01:50:48,627 --> 01:50:51,517
Mein Führer,
Frau Goebbels is here.

905
01:50:57,818 --> 01:50:59,818
What is it?

906
01:50:59,916 --> 01:51:03,312
Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.

907
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:10,105
Don't leave us Führer.
What will become of us?

908
01:51:14,201 --> 01:51:21,194
Tomorrow, I'll be cursed by
millions, but that's how it is.

909
01:51:24,291 --> 01:51:26,291
Get up. Come.

910
01:51:28,887 --> 01:51:30,887
Come.

911
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:42,273
Aunt Traudl, I like it when it thunders.

912
01:51:42,373 --> 01:51:45,970
Why?
- Nothing can happen to us here.

913
01:51:46,569 --> 01:51:48,569
Can it?
- No.

914
01:51:58,258 --> 01:52:00,258
Gotcha.

915
01:52:22,733 --> 01:52:26,230
Reichsleiter, it's over.

916
01:52:45,211 --> 01:52:47,709
The Führer is dead.

917
01:53:03,493 --> 01:53:05,493
There's daddy.

918
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:21,160
Are you crazy?
For that damned petrol of yours...

919
01:53:21,275 --> 01:53:23,275
Erich, shut up.

920
01:53:33,863 --> 01:53:35,863
Stand back.

921
01:53:48,848 --> 01:53:50,848
Come on, continue.

922
01:53:50,946 --> 01:53:52,946
Continue.

923
01:55:21,856 --> 01:55:24,853
No, don't.

924
01:55:26,252 --> 01:55:28,252
Let grandpa go.

925
01:55:34,643 --> 01:55:38,140
Order. Order.
We must have order.

926
01:55:39,339 --> 01:55:41,836
Order has to return.

927
01:55:56,222 --> 01:56:00,218
This way. We know the way.
You can trust us.

928
01:56:01,417 --> 01:56:03,417
Hurry.

929
01:56:09,509 --> 01:56:12,569
I was on the side of the Red Beasts.

930
01:56:16,102 --> 01:56:18,397
I supported the Bolsheviks.

931
01:56:25,693 --> 01:56:27,691
Let's hope the Russians got our message.

932
01:56:27,791 --> 01:56:30,288
We'll soon find out.
- Or not.

933
01:56:35,583 --> 01:56:38,580
What news do you have, General?

934
01:56:39,279 --> 01:56:44,274
Adolf Hitler and his wife
committed suicide in the bunker.

935
01:56:47,571 --> 01:56:51,567
The new government authorised me...

936
01:56:53,865 --> 01:56:56,862
to start peace talks...

937
01:56:57,461 --> 01:57:03,455
between our countries, that both
suffered severe losses.

938
01:57:04,754 --> 01:57:09,344
General, if you were me,
would you make peace with you?

939
01:57:10,049 --> 01:57:14,724
My government will never accept
unconditional surrender.

940
01:57:16,742 --> 01:57:20,738
Given the situation,
you have no other choice.

941
01:57:24,035 --> 01:57:26,840
Surrender? Never.
That's shameful.

942
01:57:27,731 --> 01:57:30,229
Years ago, I conquered Berlin on the Reds...

943
01:57:30,329 --> 01:57:34,325
and I'll defend the city to my dying day.

944
01:57:35,523 --> 01:57:38,520
In the short time I have as Chancellor...

945
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:42,616
I'll never sign a surrender treaty.

946
01:57:43,316 --> 01:57:46,912
It's for the sake of the people.
- The Führer's orders are final.

947
01:57:47,012 --> 01:57:50,752
This is crazy.
We have to start negotiations.

948
01:57:51,108 --> 01:57:54,508
I repeat, gentlemen: I do not surrender.

949
01:57:55,304 --> 01:57:58,301
Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
- Zhukov?

950
01:57:58,401 --> 01:58:01,498
What's happening?
- We're surrendering.

951
01:58:01,598 --> 01:58:06,188
Then I must kill you.
The Führer forbids any surrender.

952
01:58:24,775 --> 01:58:28,345
How long does it work?
- Around four hours.

953
01:59:05,135 --> 01:59:10,130
Children, the doctor has the
medication I told you about.

954
01:59:10,729 --> 01:59:13,704
It's a bit bitter,
but it will work.

955
01:59:14,925 --> 01:59:16,925
A sip for everybody.

956
01:59:18,022 --> 01:59:20,022
Who wants to go first?

957
01:59:22,817 --> 01:59:26,214
Heide, you're always so brave?

958
01:59:32,208 --> 01:59:34,208
Have another sip.

959
01:59:36,803 --> 01:59:38,843
See? That wasn't so bad.

960
01:59:44,096 --> 01:59:46,096
Well done.
Helmut.

961
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:54,386
This medication makes sure you don't
get ill in this humid bunker.

962
01:59:54,486 --> 01:59:57,291
But it's not humid in the bunker.

963
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,778
Well done.

964
02:00:12,568 --> 02:00:14,568
Helga.

965
02:00:16,863 --> 02:00:18,362
I don't want to.

966
02:00:18,462 --> 02:00:25,092
What's that? Do you want to get sick?
- Please, mama. I don't want to drink it.

967
02:00:26,654 --> 02:00:30,650
Don't cry, baby.
That doesn't help.

968
02:00:31,349 --> 02:00:33,984
You have to drink the medicine.

969
02:00:37,043 --> 02:00:39,043
Helga.

970
02:00:44,336 --> 02:00:46,834
Come on, open your mouth.

971
02:01:08,312 --> 02:01:10,312
Goodnight, children.

972
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,497
One day the lie will fall apart...

973
02:01:23,797 --> 02:01:27,197
and there will be light in the darkness.

974
02:01:27,893 --> 02:01:29,893
Please read that.

975
02:01:30,490 --> 02:01:36,525
One day the lie will fall apart
and there will be light in the darkness.

976
02:01:36,784 --> 02:01:40,281
Let's do it differently.
One day the lie will collapse...

977
02:01:40,381 --> 02:01:44,876
and truth will triumph once again.

978
02:01:45,675 --> 02:01:49,755
At that moment, we will stand above everybody...

979
02:01:49,771 --> 02:01:51,771
pure and...

980
02:01:54,966 --> 02:01:56,966
immaculate.

981
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:07,316
We don't stand a chance.
- So what? I want to get away.

982
02:06:07,416 --> 02:06:09,414
How do we get through the lines?

983
02:06:09,514 --> 02:06:12,511
Doesn't matter.
I'm not staying another minute.

984
02:06:12,611 --> 02:06:16,096
We'll die.
- It won't be that bad, surely.

985
02:06:16,807 --> 02:06:20,717
If we stay, the Russians will get us for sure.

986
02:06:21,502 --> 02:06:22,901
All the best.

987
02:06:23,001 --> 02:06:25,001
Come, let's go.

988
02:07:53,910 --> 02:08:00,304
On 30 April 1945, the Führer
committed suicide...

989
02:08:00,504 --> 02:08:06,098
and in doing so, he deserted
everybody who was loyal to him.

990
02:08:06,798 --> 02:08:12,408
You, German soldiers, were loyal to
the Führer and were prepared...

991
02:08:12,592 --> 02:08:19,052
to continue the battle for Berlin,
although ammunition was in short supply...

992
02:08:19,285 --> 02:08:23,881
and further resistance was pointless.

993
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:28,077
I hereby declare an immediate cease-fire.

994
02:08:29,675 --> 02:08:32,565
Each hour you continue fighting...

995
02:08:32,872 --> 02:08:39,465
prolongs the suffering of the people
of Berlin and of our wounded.

996
02:08:40,165 --> 02:08:44,160
In agreement with the supreme
command of the Soviet troops...

997
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:49,855
I order you to stop fighting immediately.

998
02:08:50,554 --> 02:08:57,547
Weidling, former commander
of the Berlin defence area.

999
02:08:59,545 --> 02:09:01,670
A glass of water, please.

1000
02:10:07,178 --> 02:10:09,576
I don't need you anymore.

1001
02:10:12,873 --> 02:10:15,470
The game's over.

1002
02:11:23,103 --> 02:11:26,300
It's time.
- Don't you see what's going on here?

1003
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:29,630
I insist that you help us,
as a doctor.

1004
02:11:30,596 --> 02:11:32,596
Alright, then.

1005
02:11:39,787 --> 02:11:44,282
Go. You did a lot.
Thank you.

1006
02:11:51,275 --> 02:11:57,169
Schädle, hurry. Come on.
- I'm not going anywhere anymore.

1007
02:11:59,966 --> 02:12:01,966
Come along.

1008
02:12:40,127 --> 02:12:42,624
Are you alright?
- Keep going.

1009
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:23,584
Sturmmann Krüger and his group
defended the Wolf Bridge...

1010
02:13:23,684 --> 02:13:26,319
and he receives the Iron Cross.

1011
02:13:26,780 --> 02:13:30,945
Sturmmann Wagner took out two
machine-gun nests...

1012
02:13:31,476 --> 02:13:34,791
and therefore, receives the Iron Cross.

1013
02:13:35,172 --> 02:13:39,168
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten
messages through the lines...

1014
02:13:39,268 --> 02:13:41,766
and receives the Iron Cross.

1015
02:14:13,035 --> 02:14:15,035
The others are coming.

1016
02:14:21,826 --> 02:14:23,826
Take cover, Müller.

1017
02:14:43,504 --> 02:14:45,504
Who's that?

1018
02:14:52,196 --> 02:14:54,196
A German.

1019
02:14:59,888 --> 02:15:01,888
Herr Hewel?

1020
02:15:05,183 --> 02:15:07,223
Thank God, you're alive.

1021
02:15:09,279 --> 02:15:11,279
Where are the others?

1022
02:15:13,475 --> 02:15:17,471
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere. Maybe.

1023
02:15:18,070 --> 02:15:21,385
Most people from my group must be dead.

1024
02:15:21,766 --> 02:15:24,911
I should never have left that bunker.

1025
02:15:24,963 --> 02:15:29,359
I should have shot myself,
but I couldn't.

1026
02:15:31,557 --> 02:15:36,147
Eat something first. There's
always enough time to die.

1027
02:16:32,097 --> 02:16:34,594
You stay with the women.

1028
02:16:35,793 --> 02:16:37,793
Come along.

1029
02:16:49,979 --> 02:16:53,975
The Russians have surrounded us.
- What's going to happen to us?

1030
02:16:54,075 --> 02:16:57,172
Maybe you can get through.
You could try.

1031
02:16:57,272 --> 02:16:59,652
I'm not taking another step.

1032
02:16:59,869 --> 02:17:04,365
Think about it. The Russians are after us.

1033
02:17:05,064 --> 02:17:10,059
As a woman, you might have a chance. Try it.

1034
02:17:11,258 --> 02:17:13,258
Good luck.

1035
02:17:15,454 --> 02:17:20,049
When you walk past the Russians,
don't look them in the eyes.

1036
02:17:20,149 --> 02:17:23,646
Remember that well. All the best.

1037
02:17:32,737 --> 02:17:34,737
The Russians.

1038
02:17:46,923 --> 02:17:49,420
Gerda, let's go.
- You go.

1039
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:53,017
I'm exhausted.
- Please.

1040
02:17:55,214 --> 02:17:59,210
I have to give it a try.
Don't be angry with me.

1041
02:18:03,606 --> 02:18:05,606
I'll be alright.

1042
02:18:18,291 --> 02:18:20,291
Herr Doktor.

1043
02:18:20,389 --> 02:18:24,885
My comrades want to surrender.
Can I join you?

1044
02:18:25,584 --> 02:18:29,580
The Führer's dead. Do you want
to continue the war on your own?

1045
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:31,680
I'm obliged by my oath.

1046
02:18:31,778 --> 02:18:36,274
Then you'd better go to the Brigadeführer.

1047
02:19:05,045 --> 02:19:07,543
The Russians are evacuating the square.
- So?

1048
02:19:07,643 --> 02:19:09,853
No opposition.
No shooting.

1049
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:13,237
Then they'll be here within the hour.

1050
02:19:13,337 --> 02:19:15,337
What shall we do?

1051
02:19:15,435 --> 02:19:19,930
We can't surrender.
- What exactly do you mean?

1052
02:19:20,630 --> 02:19:24,726
When the Russians come,
we'll empty our weapons on them.

1053
02:19:24,826 --> 02:19:29,246
The last bullets are for ourselves.
- That's radical.

1054
02:19:29,321 --> 02:19:33,911
Is this prestigious murder
and suicide our only option?

1055
02:19:34,216 --> 02:19:37,813
We're SS officers.
We can't survive the Führer.

1056
02:19:37,913 --> 02:19:40,810
Who agrees with me?

1057
02:21:28,503 --> 02:21:31,500
Come and sit down with me?
- Please.

1058
02:21:37,394 --> 02:21:43,259
Why do you want to continue living?
- And you? Why do you want to die?

1059
02:21:44,187 --> 02:21:46,187
See this?

1060
02:21:46,785 --> 02:21:49,845
The Führer gave it to me personally.

1061
02:21:50,481 --> 02:21:53,978
As a last decoration?
- Maybe.

1062
02:21:54,677 --> 02:21:59,172
A goodbye present from Hitler.
I had to promise him something.

1063
02:21:59,272 --> 02:22:04,267
If the Russians get me,
I have to kill myself.

1064
02:22:06,565 --> 02:22:10,561
Did he make you promise that?
But why?

1065
02:22:11,261 --> 02:22:14,576
Maybe he didn't want me to be forced...

1066
02:22:14,957 --> 02:22:17,507
to say anything bad about him.

1067
02:22:17,554 --> 02:22:22,150
But, as a diplomat, you're
under international protection.

1068
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:25,905
Who will benefit if you stick to your deal?

1069
02:22:26,446 --> 02:22:28,446
There they are.

1070
02:22:41,131 --> 02:22:43,131
Don't shoot, comrades.

1071
02:22:46,626 --> 02:22:51,021
We surrendered.
The war is over.

1072
02:22:52,220 --> 02:22:54,220
It's over.

1073
02:24:27,325 --> 02:24:31,322
Complete surrender took place on 7 May 1945.

1074
02:24:32,620 --> 02:24:36,617

1075
02:24:37,715 --> 02:24:42,320

than 50 million people.

1076

in German concentration camps.

Gerda Christian managed to escape
and avoid imprisonment.

1078
02:24:55,198 --> 02:24:58,298

1079
02:24:58,695 --> 02:25:02,775

1080
02:25:03,490 --> 02:25:06,886

1081
02:25:07,585 --> 02:25:11,382

by the Soviets in 1955.

on 6 August 2001.

1084
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:28,265

in the bunker, by the Red Army.

1085
02:25:28,865 --> 02:25:31,862
He died in captivity, in 1945.

1086
02:25:32,161 --> 02:25:36,146

1087
02:25:36,157 --> 02:25:40,392

1088
02:25:40,753 --> 02:25:46,047

and would break many flying records.

1089
02:25:46,247 --> 02:25:48,645

1093
02:26:01,233 --> 02:26:04,029

He committed suicide in his cell,
shortly before his execution.

1101
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:40,594
Heinrich Himmler tried to escape
using a false name.

1102
02:26:41,393 --> 02:26:44,389
After he was found out,
he committed suicide.

1103
02:26:44,689 --> 02:26:49,834
Martin Bormann and Ludwig
Stumpfegger committed suicide...

1104
02:26:50,184 --> 02:26:53,499
on 2 May 1945, near the Lehrter Bahnhof.

1105
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:58,045
Rochus Misch was released by the Soviets in 1955.

1106
02:26:58,475 --> 02:27:01,200
He still lives in Berlin.

1107
02:27:01,573 --> 02:27:04,670
Traudl Junge was classified
as a 'young follower'.

1108
02:27:04,770 --> 02:27:08,366
She worked as a secretary and lived
in Munich, until her death in 2002.

1109
02:27:08,466 --> 02:27:14,160
All the horror I heard about during
the Nuremberg trial...

1110
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:20,154
the 6 million Jews, dissidents
or people of another race...

1111
02:27:20,954 --> 02:27:26,348
who died, shocked me deeply.

1112
02:27:27,647 --> 02:27:32,242
But I hadn't made the connection
with my own past yet.

1113
02:27:33,541 --> 02:27:38,636
I reassured myself by thinking
I wasn't personally guilty of it.

1114
02:27:38,736 --> 02:27:43,731
And that I hadn't known
about the sheer size of it.

1115
02:27:44,330 --> 02:27:50,324
But one day, I walked
past a commemorative plaque...

1116
02:27:51,224 --> 02:27:55,559
for Sophie Scholl,
here in the Franz-Joseph-Strasse.

1117
02:27:55,819 --> 02:27:58,416
I saw that she was my age...

1118
02:27:58,916 --> 02:28:04,510
and that she was executed in
the year I joined Hitler.

1119
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:10,205
And only then did I realise...

1120
02:28:11,404 --> 02:28:14,001
that youth is no excuse.

1121
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:20,500
And that it might have been
possible to find out the truth.

1122
02:30:56,358 --> 02:31:00,063
DOWNFALL
