1
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,335
How are things back there.

2
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,741
Oh it's fine, slow.
I'm glad we're only a quarter-full.

3
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:14,786
Yeah, same up here.

4
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:16,702
Did you hear something
about the weather front?

5
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:18,897
Yeah, these things used to bother me.

6
00:02:18,982 --> 00:02:19,971
The weather?

7
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:24,102
No, that we're going
to be delayed getting into Paris.

8
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,824
Please tell me you're panning
on getting some sleep tonight.

9
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:29,940
I can promise you we'll be in bed early.

10
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:34,175
Emily why don't you go out with us.
It will be so fun.

11
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:35,301
Yeah, Paris at night.

12
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,297
Ze Champs Elysee. Ze clubs.

13
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:39,183
- Ze men with their...
- I will be busy.

14
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:43,462
Now if you please excuse me ladies
I have some work to do.

15
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:44,584
Yeah.

16
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:46,017
That's a hint.

17
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:47,418
Aye Aye.

18
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:02,468
So what's the deal with the special cargo?

19
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:07,149
It is some last minute top level
I government contractor shipment.

20
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:11,232
It says there's an armed guard in the hull.

21
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:12,463
That's a first.

22
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,587
What are we carrying?

23
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:16,343
I'm not sure I want to know.

24
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:18,630
Well, looks like all
the signatures check out

25
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,071
so we are free to take it from the S.O.C.

26
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:30,476
It says here if there are any
abnormalities involving the cargo area.

27
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,836
Abnormalities?

28
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:37,868
We are to contact
a Dr. Bennett and Dr. Sebastian.

29
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,357
These were the guys
that secured the cargo.

30
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,998
They're in first class.

31
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,485
Abnormalities?

32
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,716
I'm glad this is my last flight.

33
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:46,870
Yeah.

34
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:15,886
Lucas, you need to settle down now.

35
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:17,481
You're not listening.

36
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:20,640
We could lose Kelly
and I'm not going to let that happen.

37
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:21,803
Would you calm down.

38
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:22,878
You're making a scene.

39
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,448
Now I told you.

40
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,929
I will bring Kelly out of stasis

41
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,126
when we have a controlled environment.
Not before.

42
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,600
We all know this is highly unorthodox.

43
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,967
We had to move quickly.
This is her our, only way out.

44
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:34,928
Unorthodox?

45
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:37,321
Hey! She was dying and we saved her.

46
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:41,682
If we hadn't intervened, she'd be dead.
You god damn well know that.

47
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:45,273
Now, were we able to reach our friend?

48
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:46,973
Kolinsky's made all the arrangements

49
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,011
for the transport
and we'll see him in Prague.

50
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:52,007
Prague?
I though we had a lab set up in Toulon.

51
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:54,772
Christ, our files have been hacked.
That will be the first place they look.

52
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:56,061
We are running out of time!

53
00:04:56,096 --> 00:05:00,056
There have always been risks.
But think of the good we are doing.

54
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:02,777
We will save loved ones.
We will bring them back.

55
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:04,337
It's why we all have sacrificed.

56
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:06,295
Kelly knew the risks going into this.

57
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:09,019
That's easy for you to say.
That's not your wife down there.

58
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:10,611
Is it? Is it?

59
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,658
Shh, calm down. Sit down.

60
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,617
Sit down. Come on, Come on.

61
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,938
Now listen to me.
I know how you feel. I really do.

62
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:22,618
But do you for one minute
think I don't know what's at stake.

63
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:25,776
My entire company depends
on the success of this project,

64
00:05:25,863 --> 00:05:29,060
and I am less concerned about losing
one life than I am of saving thousands.

65
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,214
So I am not going to let you,
or your wife,

66
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:34,057
or some petty little
Bureaucrat jeopardize this project.

67
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,295
So shut the fuck up
and get back to your seat,

68
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,421
because this subject is closed for good.

69
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,224
Are we clear on this Doctor?

70
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,145
We're clear.

71
00:05:43,226 --> 00:05:44,137
Excuse me.

72
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:50,819
He's not going to let this go.

73
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:51,943
Don't worry about it.

74
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:54,949
Dr. Thorp will not be leaving Paris.

75
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:56,462
Not with us at any rate.

76
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,476
Excuse me miss,

77
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:08,821
I'll take a Rum and Coke please.

78
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:12,432
Oh, sorry Burrows. Rude of me.
Make that two.

79
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:19,349
Right, how bout a coke.

80
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,714
If a little bit of Bacardi were
to find its way in there,

81
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:25,548
it would be our little secret, huh.

82
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,122
Anything for you, Mr...?

83
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:35,309
Uh, Burrows, Truman.
But no thank you.

84
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:37,323
And I'm Frank.

85
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,155
Frank Lee Strathmore.

86
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,916
It's a name rich with tradition.
My umm, My family...

87
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:44,594
She doesn't need to know
your family history, Frank.

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,277
Look, I don't expect to be tied up long.

89
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,556
Just a couple of parking
ticket kinda things, really.

90
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:55,191
I mean, how bout you and I meet
at the Eiffel tower around Mid-Night...

91
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:59,443
I'm sorry to disappoint you but Frank here,
he's going to be a little busy.

92
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:00,558
That's OK.

93
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:04,320
Truman, if you guys
need anything, let me know.

94
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:05,879
Thank you.

95
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:07,441
OK.

96
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:10,475
Truman,

97
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:12,995
Truman.

98
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:15,284
Hmm. I guess that pretty
well does it for me.

99
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:19,875
Looks like if you play your cards right,
she could be cuffing you later.

100
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:26,886
You're going to shut up
and drink your coke.

101
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:37,569
Hi guys.

102
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:38,247
Hey.

103
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,497
My god you are lovely.

104
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:45,570
Hey stewardess. Do you think
I could get some sugar with my coffee?

105
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:49,893
So, is Ally packed?

106
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:52,923
She's been packed for five years.

107
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:56,849
The legendary Ray Bashore retiring.

108
00:07:58,136 --> 00:08:00,221
So why isn't she with you
on your final flight?

109
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:03,932
She insisted on staying home
to get things ready for our trip.

110
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,416
So where are you two going?

111
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:07,728
Summer vacation with the grandkids

112
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:11,819
then we're on a slow ocean cruise
to Alaska. Just the two of us.

113
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,138
That's so romantic.

114
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:15,813
The ocean cruise maybe, but the kids?

115
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,694
Sounds like a nightmare.

116
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,576
Hey,

117
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,252
that's great Ray, really.

118
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,586
Thank you.

119
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:23,134
Looks bad ahead huh?

120
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:24,736
Um, not to worry.

121
00:08:35,344 --> 00:08:38,444
So, I can't wait to go shopping
at Chanel in Paris.

122
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,545
Courtney says that
we have to go to Cartier first,

123
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,614
and then we can go to...

124
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:45,778
Yeah, well, I can't wait
to go surfing in Biarritz.

125
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:46,831
Surfing?

126
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:48,744
Oh yeah, we're going surfing.

127
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:50,507
You can go surfing.

128
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,178
Good.

129
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,108
You and that slut Jackie
can go surfing all you want.

130
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:56,463
Wow, hey, Tony's my friend alright?

131
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:58,820
We're here to surf and you know that.

132
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:02,870
And hey, his girlfriend's a total bitch
and you know that.

133
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,470
What the hell is it with you two?

134
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,082
I don't like her. OK?

135
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,603
Whatever. OK.

136
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,249
Whatever yourself.

137
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:13,797
Hey YO, Tone.

138
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:15,390
- Yeah?
- Gotta go long buddy.

139
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:18,823
Gotta go long buddy.

140
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:24,028
- Oh, oh, it hurts to get scored on.
- Stop it.

141
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:25,750
You're a child.

142
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:29,033
Wow, nice toss.

143
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:29,706
Hey!

144
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:32,185
I'll give it back to you
when I'm done playing with it.

145
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:33,311
Hey.

146
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:34,955
Dude, she cannot take the ball.

147
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:37,426
Obviously she can. Nice toss.

148
00:09:58,602 --> 00:10:00,081
- Excuse me Mr. Freeman?
- Yes?

149
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:01,422
Can I get your autograph?

150
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:02,648
Ohh yeah, sure, sure.

151
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:06,232
That final putt on the last day
of the masters, man,

152
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,518
that was poetry.

153
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:08,354
Poetry huh?

154
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:09,089
Yes.

155
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:10,762
Alright there, here you go.
Thank you.

156
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:11,805
Thanks Mr. Freeman. Thanks a lot.

157
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,601
No problem.

158
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,317
Why can't they just leave us alone?

159
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:21,999
You told me this was a trip away from golf
and everything that goes with it.

160
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,347
I know and it is.

161
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:28,205
Look, I promise that for rest of the trip,

162
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,963
I'm just gonna be plain old Billy, alright?

163
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:34,561
You won't even know Long Shot exists.
I promise you that.

164
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,926
OK.

165
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,764
I love that smile.

166
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,451
Excuse me Mr. Freeman.

167
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:39,928
Yeah?

168
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:41,865
Captain Bashore would love
to meet you.

169
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,720
When he has a break later
in the flight,

170
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,928
would you mind
if he stops by for a visit.

171
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,131
Yeah, it's not a problem.

172
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:50,523
Thank you.

173
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:52,978
You know, while you're at it,

174
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:55,574
if you're done fawning over my husband,

175
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:58,491
I'd love another Bloody Mary.

176
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,100
Anna.

177
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:01,860
William. I'm on vacation.

178
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,034
I'll get you a drink right
away Mrs. Freeman.

179
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:06,172
And make sure
you put some Vodka in it this time.

180
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:07,502
Cause that's how I like to tee-off.

181
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:10,768
Hey, there's no reason
to be so rude alright.

182
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,129
You know I'm sure
there's someone back in coach

183
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,731
who hasn't got your autograph yet.

184
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,379
Maybe I'll go back there
and give it to them.

185
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,893
You knew what you were getting
into when you married me.

186
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,455
I thought I did.

187
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:32,138
You just keep twirling
that little putter of yours.

188
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:34,542
Cause that's all
you're gonna be twirling this trip.

189
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,659
Wasn't so little last night was it?

190
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:40,423
You know you've got the wrong man, right?

191
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:42,069
Yeah,

192
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:44,300
that's why Interpol
has your picture all over the internet.

193
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:47,104
It's a classic case of mistaken identity.

194
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:48,776
Yeah.

195
00:11:51,466 --> 00:11:52,216
Hey.

196
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:54,103
Hey.

197
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:59,821
Burrows, you can't treat me like this.

198
00:12:01,028 --> 00:12:04,114
I'm not guilty. It's not fair.

199
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:06,229
Bouncing me all over the world
to stand trial here

200
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:08,221
and there for something I did not do.

201
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,225
I'm not guilty.

202
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,268
I'm not guilty.

203
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:15,311
No, I have a clear conscience.
I'm not guilty.

204
00:12:15,346 --> 00:12:16,107
Yeah.

205
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:22,343
What is it going to take
to convince you I'm innocent.

206
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,073
An act of god.

207
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:30,948
Now shut up before I make you eat
that flotation device you're sitting on.

208
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:44,872
There we go.

209
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:50,154
We can fly around it but not above it.
This is a huge system.

210
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,355
It's about 150 miles east
and west of course

211
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,112
so it looks like either way we go,

212
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,553
we are screwed.

213
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,031
It's either that
or we fly all the way back around,

214
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:02,272
but that's going to add 30 minutes
to our flight at least.

215
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:05,562
Paris weather is not good
for our arrival.

216
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,722
I'm gonna deviate left
and thread the needle.

217
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:11,804
That gap might be our only shot
of getting around...

218
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,477
...this system without landing for fuel.

219
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:28,044
Folks, looks like it's going
to get a little bit bumpy ahead.

220
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:31,808
I'd like you to remain in your seats
and wear your seatbelts.

221
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:34,606
We'll probably be through this
in 10 or 15 minutes.

222
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,088
Thank you very much.

223
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:36,854
Ohh God.

224
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:40,938
Did you hear that?

225
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:43,375
Something must have shifted and fell.

226
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:04,268
As you know Mr. Madison, a combined
strike team of the CIA and FBI

227
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,420
seized the head-quarters
of MEDCON Labs in Los Angeles.

228
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,420
A number of arrests were made,

229
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,750
but we've been unable to determine
the wear-a-bouts of four key individuals.

230
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,980
The first one, Dr. Leo Bennett.

231
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,029
He's a head research scientist
and founder of MEDCON.

232
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:23,230
Noted for his work with retro-viruses,
and synthetic biology.

233
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:26,703
He was investigated two years ago
for illegal cloning research,

234
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,309
unfortunately, that investigation failed
to produce any indictments.

235
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:32,908
So far I've seen nothing
that warrants disturbing the President.

236
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,427
Can we get to the point here?

237
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:37,429
Look, we're trying
to reconstruct Bennett's hard-drive,

238
00:15:37,515 --> 00:15:39,950
and we think there is cause for alarm.

239
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:43,591
We believe Leo Bennett is responsible

240
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,251
for the development
of a new strain of the Malaria virus.

241
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:50,827
And the containment
and transportation of Dr. Kelly Thorpe.

242
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:52,074
Malaria?

243
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:54,444
Initially we thought it was Malaria.

244
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:58,632
However, we discovered that it was something new, something different.

245
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,351
Bennett obtained a DNA sample from a Mosquito native

246
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,806
to a remote area in Vietnam

247
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:06,753
which had a 100% mortality rate
within seconds,

248
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:09,727
which then regenerates that same organism

249
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:13,728
for a few seconds or longer,
depending on the subject organism.

250
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:17,044
What Bennett has developed is
a mutation of this same mosquito virus

251
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,718
to restart major organs
for an indefinite period of time.

252
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:24,358
Now what you're saying
is that his virus kills organs

253
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:25,879
and then brings them back to life.

254
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:27,194
Not just organs.

255
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,720
He apparently was experimenting
on the resurrection

256
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,196
of the entire human body after death.

257
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:33,845
Oh impossible. I can't go to the president with this.

258
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:34,973
Jerry, I mean come on.

259
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:38,523
From what we've uncovered,
we believe he succeeded.

260
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:23,607
Ah, hello?

261
00:17:43,302 --> 00:17:44,736
What is going on?

262
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:54,014
What is happening to me?

263
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,191
God damn it.

264
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:58,672
Jesus, what now?

265
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:03,278
We have electrical
and communication problems.

266
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,630
We just had a temperature drop
in the cargo hold.

267
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:10,917
This is Concord 239 to base.

268
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:14,116
This is Concord 239 to base.

269
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:17,960
Great, no radio.

270
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,034
With this crap for the next hour.
Perfect.

271
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:22,001
What the hell is wrong with you?

272
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:26,041
I'm sick. I need help.

273
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,240
I need help.

274
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:38,201
I'm a scientist with MEDCON Labs.

275
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,918
Where the hell is Dr. Bennett?

276
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:50,246
I need to talk to someone.

277
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,959
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.

278
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:55,923
Come out. I won't shoot.

279
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:25,614
What the fuck.

280
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:28,007
Fuck. Where is she?

281
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:34,091
Oh god, oh!

282
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,300
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

283
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:49,698
OK.

284
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:52,534
Hey will you grab me a Diet Coke
on your way back?

285
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:54,214
Sure honey.

286
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:55,293
Thanks babe.

287
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:08,259
Check out that dime.

288
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,815
Wow, that is one hot little biatch.

289
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:18,189
Ouch, fuck that hurt.

290
00:21:18,224 --> 00:21:19,258
Oh hi honey.

291
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,267
So I guess that mid-flight blowjob
is out of the question?

292
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,986
Such a dick.

293
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:27,140
Sweetheart?

294
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,702
What?

295
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:40,905
Come here.

296
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,682
What? What's wrong?

297
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:57,266
I mean, what is somebody sees us?

298
00:21:58,438 --> 00:21:59,283
What are you talk...

299
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,956
we're in a bathroom
what are you talking about?

300
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,916
No I... you know what I mean.

301
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,831
You're Peter's best friend.

302
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,430
So what?

303
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:33,761
Oh, I'm sorry.

304
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:35,742
Oh, pardon me.
I didn't mean to scare you.

305
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:37,638
No, it's ok. I wasn't paying attention.

306
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:40,116
Sir, you actually need to take your seat.
The fasten seatbelt sign is on.

307
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:41,401
Yeah, yeah, um.

308
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:42,727
Can I get you some more coffee? Ok.

309
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:43,716
Yes, thank you.

310
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,573
You're welcome.

311
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:47,644
Oh, Megan, rhymes with Vegan.
I was a vegan.

312
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:48,929
- Yeah?
- For two days.

313
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:50,157
Megan Vegan.

314
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,288
It's actually "Megan".

315
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:54,329
Right, no, I knew that.

316
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,479
Sir, you actually need to take your seat.

317
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,003
Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah.

318
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,809
I just, you need to be more careful.

319
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,611
I mean, people sneaking up
on you like that.

320
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,169
You know, there's strange people here.

321
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:05,210
You never can tell what's going
to happen on these flights.

322
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:06,611
- Sir you need to take your seat.
- OK.

323
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:08,968
- Thanks, thanks. Buckle-up.
- You're welcome.

324
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:32,093
Jesus.

325
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:46,176
Ha, wow. Cool, huh?

326
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:14,979
Maybe this little diversion will keep
my mind off of your tasteless cheap suit.

327
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:19,060
Would you feel better if I was
in a bitch-ass, orange jumpsuit?

328
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:21,060
Like the one you are going
to be wearing the rest of your life.

329
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:22,674
There you go getting nasty again

330
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,347
when I am merely offering a criticism

331
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,595
of the sartorial horror show you call a suit.

332
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,510
However, I do like the shirt.
Does it come in a man's style?

333
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:36,501
And for your information, the jumpsuits

334
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:38,867
in France are a sort of burgundy. Yeah.

335
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,393
Well you should look nice in that color.

336
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:42,398
And now I know what color corsage

337
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:44,554
to get you when big Pierre
makes you his wife.

338
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:46,192
Someone sounds a wee bit jealous.

339
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:48,144
Yeah.

340
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,161
I'm going to descend a little.

341
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,364
Is it over yet?

342
00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:28,250
Let's find out.

343
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:32,851
This is Randy.

344
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:34,045
It's Stacy.

345
00:26:34,818 --> 00:26:37,013
I think some of the passengers
might have been hurt.

346
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:38,008
How bad?

347
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,459
I don't know.
It's a mess down here.

348
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:42,812
Well, we'll do the best we can.

349
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,135
Just stand by.

350
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,697
Looks like we're OK for a few minutes.

351
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:54,580
Give them the "go ahead" to check.
Let me know what's what.

352
00:26:59,063 --> 00:27:02,613
Well folks, we apologize for the heavy
turbulence we have just experienced.

353
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,380
It appears as though
we're clear for the moment.

354
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,058
However, we are traveling
through some unstable air.

355
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:12,617
So as a precaution I would like you
to remain in your seats for the time being.

356
00:27:12,706 --> 00:27:17,107
At this time, I would only like our flight
attendants up and about the cabin.

357
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:17,983
Thank you.

358
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:21,983
Would you make sure everyone's alright?

359
00:27:22,068 --> 00:27:25,140
Then have one of the Doctors,
Bennett or Sebastian,

360
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,902
check the cargo situation out with you.

361
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:29,539
The cargo?

362
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,263
I'll get my tools.

363
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:40,907
Is she ok?

364
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,186
It's her head.

365
00:27:58,196 --> 00:27:59,470
You alright dude. Did you take one?

366
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:01,706
The fucking bag hit me in the head.

367
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:03,594
Come on, that was fun.
It was just turbulence.

368
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:05,076
My god, don't be such a baby.

369
00:28:05,157 --> 00:28:06,067
It didn't hit you.

370
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:07,147
Relax.

371
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:10,270
What is your problem girl?

372
00:28:10,358 --> 00:28:12,668
Oh, are you scared we're going to crash?

373
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,524
Relax bitch. Enjoy the ride.

374
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,028
Wow, Jesus, pipe down you psycho.

375
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,357
Shut up.

376
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,074
What hell's wrong with you?

377
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,326
What?

378
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:22,635
You are a psycho.

379
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:27,111
You know, and you're a fucking skank.
I'm so sick of your shit.

380
00:28:29,002 --> 00:28:30,208
Stop it!

381
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:31,961
Everyone just calm down.

382
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,601
Take your seats.

383
00:28:33,683 --> 00:28:35,800
And you take your seats too.

384
00:28:35,884 --> 00:28:36,839
Take your seats.

385
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:42,799
What is wrong with you.

386
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,051
We have several warning lights

387
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:49,521
we don't usually get,
even with this weather.

388
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:52,405
It's probably nothing,
but we should look just to see.

389
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:54,806
I agree, why don't you two go.

390
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,518
Both of us?

391
00:28:58,249 --> 00:28:58,886
Right.

392
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:01,368
Well whoever is going,
meet me by that exit door.

393
00:29:01,403 --> 00:29:03,488
It usually takes a few minutes
to get down there

394
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,322
and there's no easy way to go.

395
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:09,806
God damn it.

396
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:11,451
I told you. I told you both...

397
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:12,857
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

398
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:14,371
Just go check on the passenger.

399
00:29:17,413 --> 00:29:19,608
If it was a malfunction,
Kelly might be dead.

400
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:21,173
Yeah listen, don't take your eye off him.

401
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:23,006
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

402
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:29,855
You guys ok?

403
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,141
I'm fine.

404
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,816
But do you think
we could move up to business class.

405
00:29:33,851 --> 00:29:35,694
I mean, the planes really empty and all...

406
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:36,892
- He's kidding. We're fine.
- OK.

407
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:37,887
Thank you.

408
00:29:39,338 --> 00:29:42,091
Hey, I am trying to help you out here.

409
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,499
She wants you. Make your move.

410
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:46,217
Go boy go.

411
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,412
I'm sorry if this is a problem.

412
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,935
No problem. I'll take care of it.

413
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:58,135
It could be dangerous.

414
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:00,621
Only if you're afraid of the dark.

415
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:06,821
Come on Burrows.
I need to go to the sandbox.

416
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:07,861
What?

417
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:08,854
I got to pee.

418
00:30:09,344 --> 00:30:12,223
No, you heard the PA.
Sit down and hold it.

419
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,580
Fine.

420
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:20,306
If you should happen
to feel something warm,

421
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:22,059
just move a little to your right.

422
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:24,900
You're like a five year old.

423
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:28,980
Come on let's go.

424
00:30:32,189 --> 00:30:33,702
Easy. Take it slow.

425
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:34,666
Yes, of course.

426
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:47,821
Burrows?

427
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:52,308
Burrows?

428
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,083
Mr. Burrows,

429
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:36,959
Truman.

430
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:38,433
Oh my god.

431
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:45,159
Alright gentleman. Here we go.

432
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:00,796
Truman.

433
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:02,798
Truman.

434
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,360
What?

435
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:32,287
That little shit.

436
00:32:42,017 --> 00:32:42,702
Flight-deck.

437
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:45,252
Captain, this is Megan at door 4L.

438
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,898
We've got a problem back here.

439
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:48,810
OK. How bad is it?

440
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,969
Mr. Burrows, the cop
who brought the prisoner on board,

441
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:56,771
was knocked out cold,
and his prisoner is missing.

442
00:33:11,183 --> 00:33:14,584
Excuse me, have you guys seen
a funny looking skinny guy,

443
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:16,017
blue sweatshirt, turtle-neck,
walk through here?

444
00:33:16,585 --> 00:33:17,381
No.

445
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:19,057
No? No? Alright.

446
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:10,391
Well that explains
the communication problem.

447
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:12,106
Fry,

448
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:13,094
Dr. Thorp?

449
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:13,992
Kevin?

450
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:22,112
Fry's not in the jump-seat.

451
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,510
My god. This can't be happening.

452
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,046
We need to get out of her, now.

453
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,481
Come on. We need to seal
the hatch now. Let's move.

454
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:34,277
Come on.

455
00:34:35,122 --> 00:34:36,760
Lucas.

456
00:34:39,323 --> 00:34:40,300
Kelly.

457
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:41,278
Oh god.

458
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:43,754
No, no!

459
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:56,095
Tony?

460
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:06,531
Tony?

461
00:36:16,063 --> 00:36:16,894
Asshole.

462
00:36:21,785 --> 00:36:23,503
Don't scare me like that...

463
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:26,546
What? Hey, where the fuck are you going?

464
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:27,501
That hurts.

465
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,846
And don't use that kind of
language around me.

466
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:50,906
Hey you two.

467
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,348
You need to be in your seats
with the belts fastened.

468
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,311
Why don't you make yourself
a fucking sandwich while you're at it.

469
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:45,643
What have you done?
You son of a bitch.

470
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:47,235
What have you brought on board?

471
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,041
Take your seats everyone. Take your seats.

472
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:59,242
Everyone just calm down.

473
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:00,600
Do you know what's going on?

474
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:02,836
Ray, open up.

475
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:05,116
What's wrong? Randy!

476
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:06,677
Ray, bring the plane down.

477
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,005
Ray, bring the plane down.

478
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:09,965
Bring the plane down right now,
or we're all going to fucking die.

479
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,842
Tell me what the hell happened down there.

480
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,879
Ray. The fucking, the fucking,

481
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:24,131
the fucking scientists,
they let something out of the cargo-hold.

482
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,052
What are you talking about?
Where are the doctors?

483
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,804
They're dead. Ray, they're dead...

484
00:38:27,892 --> 00:38:29,371
- Sit down!
- Look at me man.

485
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:31,603
Everyone's going to fucking die.
They killed them.

486
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:33,445
Sit down and calm down.

487
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:35,533
Sit down.

488
00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:37,373
Now. Sit down.

489
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:39,963
What happened to you?

490
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:44,324
Listen to me.
Just listen to me, Ray.

491
00:38:45,496 --> 00:38:48,294
If you don't land this plane soon,

492
00:38:49,017 --> 00:38:54,376
you, me, Emily, everybody
on this fucking plane is going to die.

493
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,335
You know I can't bring her down
without warning

494
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:59,297
and no place to land. Think about it.

495
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:00,848
There is something..

496
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,254
it's not human, down there man.

497
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,141
And it's going to kill everyone on board
unless we land this plane.

498
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:10,211
So whatever you do,
I don't care how you do it, just, just...

499
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:12,062
- I need you to calm down...
- Find a place, Ray,

500
00:39:12,097 --> 00:39:13,381
and land the fucking plane.

501
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:15,342
- Find a piece of straight fucking road.
- You know the radio's gone,

502
00:39:15,377 --> 00:39:16,696
and this storm isn't helping our situation.

503
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:18,535
It's clear we can try to cross.

504
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,534
But I'm turning around
and heading back.

505
00:39:20,623 --> 00:39:22,349
There's a TSA man aboard.

506
00:39:22,384 --> 00:39:25,342
Find out which passenger he is
and get him up here.

507
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:26,175
Now!

508
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:27,456
Ray.

509
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:36,939
Are you sure that's the guy?

510
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:04,222
Ok, they're dead.

511
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:09,067
And you say whatever killed them,
wasn't human.

512
00:40:09,394 --> 00:40:11,305
I know it sounds insane.

513
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:13,200
I saw this happen.

514
00:40:13,235 --> 00:40:16,387
I mean those things,
I mean they ripped those men apart

515
00:40:16,476 --> 00:40:18,068
and they were eating them.

516
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:20,511
You said there was a fugitive on board.

517
00:40:20,596 --> 00:40:22,357
Is it possible you saw him down there?

518
00:40:22,392 --> 00:40:23,585
No.

519
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:26,595
I told you. There were two of them

520
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,512
and these... these things aren't human.

521
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,716
I'm going to go find out
what was in those containers.

522
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:34,994
Where are you going?

523
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,360
I'm going to go talk
to that asshole Bennett cause he knows.

524
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:38,315
Sit down.

525
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:42,919
Well, I'll check it out and report back.

526
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:55,159
Any sign of him?

527
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:56,760
No.

528
00:40:56,844 --> 00:40:57,609
Shoot.

529
00:40:57,644 --> 00:40:59,120
How's your head?

530
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:00,595
Better than my ego.

531
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:02,360
Come on, he can't hide forever.

532
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:05,085
As soon as the turbulence settles,
I'm going to go look for him some more.

533
00:41:05,526 --> 00:41:07,132
Don't go alone.

534
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:09,362
Why? Is he dangerous?

535
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:11,757
Well, he's probably never owned
a weapon before,

536
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:13,281
but he's more
of a con-artist than anything.

537
00:41:13,368 --> 00:41:15,165
What did he do? Can you tell me?

538
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:17,882
He posed as an accountant,

539
00:41:17,982 --> 00:41:20,189
skimmed 35 millions of the Russian mob,

540
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:22,087
stole their Jet and crash-landed it.

541
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,809
And we finally caught up to him.
Everybody wants him.

542
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:27,730
Why are you taking him to Paris?

543
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:34,550
You ok?

544
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:35,409
Yes.

545
00:41:36,573 --> 00:41:37,642
You should take your seat.

546
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,052
OK. Be careful.

547
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:39,771
OK

548
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:48,166
Hey look at this.
I think I found Concord 239.

549
00:41:53,937 --> 00:41:55,914
Nobody's been able to reach them
for over an hour.

550
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:57,893
Los Angeles dispatch,
this is Yellow-Knife-Center.

551
00:41:57,978 --> 00:42:00,936
I believe I have your concord 239
on my screen.

552
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:03,619
It's in the middle
of two huge weather fronts.

553
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,769
And transponder indicates it's off course.

554
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,050
No, no radio contact yet. I'll try now.

555
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,016
Concord 239, Yellow-Knife-Center.

556
00:42:16,382 --> 00:42:18,259
Concord 239, Yellow-Knife-Center.

557
00:42:20,062 --> 00:42:21,416
Los Angeles Dispatch,

558
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:24,222
yes I understand.

559
00:42:28,664 --> 00:42:32,165
I repeat, you must tell 239
to return to US airspace.

560
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,666
The Canadian government
will not permit them to land

561
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:37,941
or continue to fly in their airspace.

562
00:42:38,026 --> 00:42:39,699
This decision has come
from the highest level

563
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:42,247
of the Canadian government as well as the
US State Department

564
00:42:42,347 --> 00:42:44,100
and the CDC. Is that clear?

565
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:48,627
Can you tell me what it is
you're transporting in the cargo-hold?

566
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:49,979
I'm sorry.

567
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,540
My cargo is a highly classified project
linked to our nation's security.

568
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,503
You don't have the necessary clearance.

569
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,946
I'm with the TSA, Federal Air-Marshall.

570
00:42:58,031 --> 00:42:59,916
I need to know what's down there.

571
00:42:59,951 --> 00:43:04,150
Well how fortunate for us to have a man
with your obvious talents aboard.

572
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:09,342
You seem a bit nervous Doc.

573
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,786
Is everything alright?

574
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:12,468
Just don't like flying.

575
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:15,554
Isn't it true your
two colleagues accompanied

576
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:17,750
the co-pilot down to the cargo-hold

577
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:19,348
because there was some problem.

578
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:20,185
No, no problem.

579
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:21,481
No problem?

580
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,029
It's just a routine mid-flight inspection.

581
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:24,549
Routine.

582
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:27,389
What I can tell you,

583
00:43:27,477 --> 00:43:29,122
while the cargo isn't dangerous,

584
00:43:29,157 --> 00:43:32,355
it's highly perishable
and extremely valuable.

585
00:43:32,438 --> 00:43:35,556
So, the cargo area is off limits
to unauthorized personnel.

586
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,628
- Well, can you tell me...
- No, I'm sorry.

587
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,517
I've said more
than I should have already.

588
00:44:05,445 --> 00:44:06,241
Burrows?

589
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:07,971
Yeah.

590
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:11,716
Paul Judd, TSA. I believe
your prisoner is in the cargo-hold.

591
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:17,284
Ready?

592
00:44:36,492 --> 00:44:37,368
Hey Frank.

593
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:43,444
Frank.

594
00:44:44,334 --> 00:44:46,564
Frank. Get out here.

595
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:47,803
Dr. Thorp.

596
00:44:48,975 --> 00:44:50,294
Dr. Sebastian.

597
00:44:57,656 --> 00:44:58,772
Anybody out there?

598
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:01,405
That's a lot of blood.

599
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:03,143
Somebody's in trouble.

600
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:05,294
Yeah, if it's Frank's
he needs help now.

601
00:45:20,181 --> 00:45:20,932
Check that out.

602
00:45:22,622 --> 00:45:24,374
Looks like he escaped
through the ducts.

603
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:26,293
I don't know.

604
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,891
That's an awful lot of blood
for a skinny little shit like Frank.

605
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:33,183
You go that way. I'll go this way.

606
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,064
Meet back in 5.

607
00:45:35,145 --> 00:45:35,941
Yes.

608
00:45:56,909 --> 00:45:57,899
Hey Frank.

609
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,779
You there buddy?

610
00:46:07,192 --> 00:46:09,308
Why don't you come out
and talk to me, man?

611
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:11,625
Everything's alright. It's cool.

612
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:14,665
We can just talk. It's just me.

613
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:18,903
Frankie.

614
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,988
I'm going to kill that little shit.

615
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:32,995
Alright, I'm coming up.

616
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:44,196
Yes.

617
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,235
You're sure?

618
00:46:49,361 --> 00:46:50,271
Outstanding.

619
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:51,950
Thank you Lieutenant.

620
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:56,162
They have located Bennett and his team.

621
00:46:56,197 --> 00:46:57,436
Hallelujah.

622
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:27,447
You know Frank,
sometimes this job is really boring.

623
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:29,886
This is not one of those times, bud.

624
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,768
You're making this real exciting.

625
00:47:39,452 --> 00:47:40,726
Son of a bitch.

626
00:48:05,577 --> 00:48:06,373
Paul?

627
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:24,051
Frank?

628
00:48:48,627 --> 00:48:49,423
Oh my god.

629
00:48:49,507 --> 00:48:50,462
Oh my god I'm going to be sick.

630
00:48:50,547 --> 00:48:52,777
Oh my god.
Cara where the fuck are you going.

631
00:48:52,867 --> 00:48:54,381
What the fuck?

632
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:56,584
Tony, this bitch just got shot dude.

633
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:58,705
There's fucking bullets coming
from somewhere.

634
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,236
Please take your seats.

635
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:09,182
Take your seats. Everything's fine.

636
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:10,386
Please, take your seats.

637
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:11,872
Everything's fine.

638
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,748
Thank you.

639
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:23,073
Ray, it's total chaos down here.

640
00:49:23,154 --> 00:49:27,194
There were gunshots or something
that freaked out the passengers.

641
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:37,747
Emily?

642
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:40,037
Go, take the gun.

643
00:50:33,689 --> 00:50:35,965
My god, this can't be happening.

644
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,403
Get back.
Go back to your seats and stay there.

645
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:43,121
Go back.

646
00:51:13,258 --> 00:51:14,737
Move, move, move, move.

647
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:18,815
Get out of my way.

648
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:20,617
Cara. Cara.

649
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,900
Cara, open the door.

650
00:51:22,935 --> 00:51:23,571
Move.

651
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,376
Cara.

652
00:51:34,703 --> 00:51:35,658
Oh shit.

653
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:36,858
Dude, what the fuck?

654
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:38,740
Get back. Get back. Get back.

655
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:39,495
Get back.

656
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:41,336
Get out of here. Get out of here.

657
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:43,174
Cara.

658
00:51:43,264 --> 00:51:45,415
- Stay back there. Stay back there.
- Cara.

659
00:51:45,505 --> 00:51:46,785
What the fuck, dude?

660
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:47,581
What is this?

661
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:50,781
- Christ.
- Holy shit.

662
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:52,458
Get off him. Get off him.

663
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:29,904
What the fuck? What the fuck?

664
00:52:34,515 --> 00:52:35,915
What the fuck is going on?

665
00:52:36,276 --> 00:52:37,675
Please, please,

666
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:41,675
please go back to your seats.

667
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:43,415
Oh my god.

668
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:44,274
Oh my god.

669
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:44,949
Oh my god.

670
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:48,893
Oh my god, what happened?

671
00:52:48,928 --> 00:52:52,748
What the fuck happened?

672
00:53:02,402 --> 00:53:04,279
Please take your seats.

673
00:53:13,204 --> 00:53:14,319
Flight-deck.

674
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:16,635
Ray, something's happened down here.

675
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:21,475
Something attacked one
of the passengers, and he's dead.

676
00:53:21,566 --> 00:53:23,318
You got to get us down, Ray.

677
00:53:23,406 --> 00:53:24,441
Oh my god.

678
00:53:24,526 --> 00:53:26,247
- Megan, listen to me.
- You don't understand.

679
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:27,919
There's blood everywhere.

680
00:53:28,007 --> 00:53:31,478
And, and Stacy
and one of the other passengers was hurt.

681
00:53:31,568 --> 00:53:32,967
How did it happen?
Who attacked you?

682
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:37,529
I don't know,
um, maybe the escaped prisoner.

683
00:53:37,564 --> 00:53:38,723
I can't think of anyone else.

684
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:39,735
Look, Megan

685
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,409
we've turned around and we'll land
the first place we can find.

686
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,085
But the only way back is through
the center of the storm.

687
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:49,810
We need to get the passengers
back to their seats now.

688
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:51,447
OK.

689
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:39,898
I'm scared Meg.

690
00:55:03,268 --> 00:55:04,257
Oh, my god!

691
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:17,267
Shit.

692
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:20,224
Help me.

693
00:55:20,952 --> 00:55:21,782
Open.

694
00:55:22,472 --> 00:55:24,383
Oh, shit.
They're going to kill us all.

695
00:55:24,472 --> 00:55:26,464
I really should go check
on the passengers.

696
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:40,505
Open this door.

697
00:55:40,596 --> 00:55:41,401
Help me.

698
00:55:41,436 --> 00:55:43,472
For Christ's sake, they are going to kills us all.

699
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:45,576
Open the fucking door.

700
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:47,596
God damn it. Help me.

701
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:31,197
Bill?

702
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,558
Hey. What's going on?

703
00:56:35,648 --> 00:56:38,163
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- What's going on man?

704
00:56:38,198 --> 00:56:40,679
I can't explain.
We've got to get out of here.

705
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:45,366
- They're going to kill us.
- Calm down and tell me what's going on.

706
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,531
What is going on, man?

707
00:56:48,566 --> 00:56:49,646
We need to hide.

708
00:56:49,731 --> 00:56:51,376
We need to hide.

709
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:54,006
We need to get out of here,
or we're going to die.

710
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21,130
Bill, where are you going?

711
00:57:59,426 --> 00:58:00,654
Come on, come on.

712
00:58:01,226 --> 00:58:01,631
Where?

713
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:04,500
Back-galley. The floors 2 feet thick.
It's the only safe place.

714
00:58:04,587 --> 00:58:05,861
I can't, I can't my wife is upstairs.

715
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,868
Well get her and get back
there as soon as you can.

716
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:11,984
Come on, now. Come on.

717
00:58:48,076 --> 00:58:49,430
Hey you, come on.

718
00:58:49,517 --> 00:58:51,030
- Help me get this open.
- Tell me something.

719
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:53,157
It's the only place we can find.

720
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:56,273
Shh, shh, be quiet.

721
00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:00,559
Hey, you, you get in there.
See if you can see anything.

722
00:59:00,594 --> 00:59:01,878
Go on. Get up. Get up.

723
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,637
See anything?

724
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,605
Help me!

725
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,120
Come on baby.

726
00:59:12,402 --> 00:59:13,312
Come on...

727
00:59:16,162 --> 00:59:17,118
Stacy!

728
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,385
Duck!

729
00:59:43,488 --> 00:59:44,814
Oh my god.

730
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:46,441
Are you alright? No bites?

731
00:59:46,529 --> 00:59:48,008
We thought. We thought...

732
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:50,530
What? That it was me gnawing
on all the passengers?

733
00:59:50,565 --> 00:59:52,168
No. I'm a vegetarian.

734
01:00:10,454 --> 01:00:11,934
The overall feeling among the scientists

735
01:00:12,015 --> 01:00:16,133
working on this is that we are dealing
with a serum transfer virus.

736
01:00:16,216 --> 01:00:20,004
This virus is without
a known vaccine or cure.

737
01:00:20,376 --> 01:00:23,335
But this type virus transfers
only through bodily fluids.

738
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:26,615
And then most effectively,
blood from an infect victim.

739
01:00:26,698 --> 01:00:28,703
And it enters a cut or saliva.

740
01:00:28,738 --> 01:00:30,904
The MEDCON scientists believed
they could make this work,

741
01:00:30,939 --> 01:00:33,578
despite the side-effects.
That of being brought back from the dead.

742
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:36,305
In fact, they looked
at these side-effects as a benefit.

743
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,890
Let me paraphrase these notes
that we found on Dr. Bennett's desk.

744
01:00:40,381 --> 01:00:42,849
They wanted this virus as a bio-weapon.

745
01:00:42,941 --> 01:00:46,347
To keep soldiers fighting
after they've been mortally wounded.

746
01:00:46,382 --> 01:00:51,013
To release a captive enemy infected
with the virus and let him infect others

747
01:00:51,103 --> 01:00:52,252
until they all kill each other.

748
01:00:55,024 --> 01:00:58,813
I'm going to recommend
to you and to the president

749
01:00:59,425 --> 01:01:03,339
that we destroy flight 239
before it can reach a populated area.

750
01:01:04,106 --> 01:01:05,175
Let me get this straight.

751
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:07,352
You want our forces to follow a shoot

752
01:01:07,387 --> 01:01:09,901
to kill order regarding
a civilian aircraft?

753
01:01:10,347 --> 01:01:12,100
We've had no communication with the aircraft.

754
01:01:12,748 --> 01:01:15,216
We must assume the cargo has been breached

755
01:01:15,308 --> 01:01:17,664
and that the virus has spread
throughout the passenger section.

756
01:01:17,749 --> 01:01:19,262
The only chance we have to contain

757
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:23,263
this is to vaporize every living thing aboard that aircraft.

758
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:26,309
Before the virus can reach
a major population center.

759
01:01:29,191 --> 01:01:30,625
Do you concur?

760
01:01:30,712 --> 01:01:31,667
I'm afraid I do.

761
01:01:40,354 --> 01:01:41,992
Can you get me the president please?

762
01:01:51,196 --> 01:01:52,549
Mother of god.

763
01:01:59,158 --> 01:02:01,038
Get off of her. Get off.

764
01:02:01,073 --> 01:02:01,868
Get off.

765
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,389
Oh my god.

766
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,240
Why? Why'd you do this huh?

767
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:57,736
Hey, I'm talking to you, man.

768
01:02:57,771 --> 01:03:00,968
It wasn't me.
I was just following orders.

769
01:03:02,171 --> 01:03:03,697
They told me it was
an experiment to extend life.

770
01:03:03,732 --> 01:03:06,612
I had no idea there
would be these crazy side-effects.

771
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:08,218
Well look around you asshole.

772
01:03:08,253 --> 01:03:10,403
Your side-effects
have eaten half the passengers.

773
01:03:11,013 --> 01:03:12,019
Hey, I don't have to listen to you.

774
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:14,409
You were the one that seemed
like you were giving all the orders.

775
01:03:14,494 --> 01:03:15,609
You were the one
that the cop was talking to.

776
01:03:15,694 --> 01:03:16,650
And you were the one
that sent the others below.

777
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,724
I heard all of that.

778
01:03:17,815 --> 01:03:18,964
You don't know
what you're talking about.

779
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:20,204
It wasn't me I tell you.

780
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:21,524
Hey, keep your voice down.

781
01:03:22,176 --> 01:03:24,895
Well you just keep talking.
You'll draw their attention.

782
01:04:41,393 --> 01:04:43,954
It's starting
to get really tight in here.

783
01:04:44,034 --> 01:04:45,945
Yeah, yeah,
I think we're getting closer.

784
01:05:04,038 --> 01:05:07,270
Ray. Ray, I'm hurt.

785
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:08,792
Open up. Hurry.

786
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:11,549
Ray.

787
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,710
Hurry.

788
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,084
Oh my god.

789
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,364
I don't know if that's going to work.

790
01:05:55,449 --> 01:05:56,598
It has to work.

791
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:07,725
Let's get the other side.

792
01:06:07,812 --> 01:06:08,562
OK.

793
01:06:16,454 --> 01:06:19,093
Two in the chest.
One in the balls. That's what I say.

794
01:06:20,734 --> 01:06:21,690
It's barricaded.

795
01:06:23,535 --> 01:06:25,048
Ah, Frank I see you.

796
01:06:25,776 --> 01:06:28,210
You get that?
He is a little beaver.

797
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:34,532
Come on.

798
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,174
- Oh my god.
- Come here Frank.

799
01:06:51,061 --> 01:06:52,255
Where have you been?

800
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,240
Where have I been?

801
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:54,138
Where have you been?

802
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:54,747
Where have you been?

803
01:06:54,782 --> 01:06:57,091
- I have been up and down this plane looking
- So have I.

804
01:06:57,182 --> 01:06:57,933
Hey, back off.

805
01:07:28,469 --> 01:07:32,110
Statistically speaking, the tail section
is the safest place to be in a crash.

806
01:07:32,145 --> 01:07:33,702
- Of course, no one...
- Frank, not now.

807
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:35,019
Help me with this.

808
01:07:40,112 --> 01:07:41,545
Go get something else.

809
01:07:41,632 --> 01:07:43,512
- Get something else.
- I am.

810
01:07:43,547 --> 01:07:44,502
Do it.

811
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:45,912
Right there.

812
01:07:48,193 --> 01:07:50,105
I can't lift. There's a... wait.

813
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:51,224
Frank.

814
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:56,669
Wait, wait, wait, shh.

815
01:07:57,756 --> 01:08:00,111
Quiet, quiet. I hear something.

816
01:08:03,877 --> 01:08:05,026
I don't hear anything.

817
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:09,514
Go.

818
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,152
Hold on. Hold on.

819
01:08:26,882 --> 01:08:28,156
Oh my god, baby.

820
01:08:40,405 --> 01:08:42,045
OK, we got to go. We got to go.

821
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,716
We got to go.

822
01:08:42,805 --> 01:08:44,239
Go, go, go, go.

823
01:08:44,966 --> 01:08:47,161
Alright, we need to find anything
that can be used as a weapon.

824
01:08:47,726 --> 01:08:49,399
Does anyone have anything sharp.

825
01:08:49,487 --> 01:08:51,572
They confiscated my toenail-clippers.

826
01:08:51,607 --> 01:08:54,680
Pearl handled with
matching tweezers. Quite lovely.

827
01:08:55,688 --> 01:08:57,048
Damn Frank, you should have brought those.

828
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:57,879
You could have saved the day.

829
01:08:57,969 --> 01:08:58,774
You never know.

830
01:08:58,809 --> 01:09:00,334
How much ammunition do you have left?

831
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,725
I got five in here and one clip.
What about you?

832
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,482
One full clip. Five more.

833
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:05,446
Shit.

834
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:11,088
Maybe we could electrocute
the bastards.

835
01:09:11,171 --> 01:09:12,400
- No, no.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

836
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:16,726
I guess that could have gone better.

837
01:09:18,453 --> 01:09:21,207
Frank, you stupid shit.
Please tell me you're dead.

838
01:09:29,615 --> 01:09:30,765
Where'd you find him?

839
01:09:32,136 --> 01:09:32,966
The auxiliary lights...

840
01:09:33,056 --> 01:09:33,861
Oh my god.

841
01:09:33,896 --> 01:09:38,015
The auxiliary lights will come
on any second. I hope.

842
01:09:40,538 --> 01:09:42,017
Frank. We need to find weapons.

843
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,021
Still no answer from the cockpit?

844
01:09:59,102 --> 01:09:59,932
Nothing.

845
01:10:00,902 --> 01:10:03,371
I can't believe everyone's dead.

846
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:04,816
My god, we're going to die.

847
01:10:04,903 --> 01:10:07,213
Megan. Listen to me. Listen to me.

848
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:08,623
- We are not going to die...
- No?

849
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,581
No, we're not going to die.
I promise you.

850
01:10:11,544 --> 01:10:14,457
I need your help.
I need you to be strong.

851
01:10:14,545 --> 01:10:15,136
Right.

852
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:32,298
Did you see that?

853
01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:33,538
What the hell was that?

854
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:42,347
Listen.

855
01:10:48,192 --> 01:10:49,103
Someone's up there.

856
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:56,584
Don't shoot.

857
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:11,388
We need to have a plan to get
this plane down safely.

858
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:13,116
Does anyone know
if the pilot's still alive?

859
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:14,313
I, I tried to reach him.

860
01:11:14,398 --> 01:11:15,308
Try him again.

861
01:11:15,718 --> 01:11:16,390
OK.

862
01:11:27,441 --> 01:11:28,840
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

863
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:30,753
The captain is dead.
We're on auto-pilot.

864
01:11:30,842 --> 01:11:31,672
So what,

865
01:11:31,762 --> 01:11:33,195
- we just fly around till they get us?
- - No.

866
01:11:33,242 --> 01:11:36,474
Or until we run out of fuel.
Actually, that might be preferred.

867
01:11:36,843 --> 01:11:37,832
- Run out of fuel?
- Yeah.

868
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:39,801
Hey, we got to get to the flight-deck
to check on the captain.

869
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:41,529
We got to do this now before
they start coming at us.

870
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:43,324
I don't think you have enough bullets
to make it to the cockpit.

871
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,156
The guard down below has a weapon.

872
01:11:45,245 --> 01:11:46,075
We need that weapon.

873
01:11:46,165 --> 01:11:47,170
That's our only chance.
- Absolutely.

874
01:11:47,205 --> 01:11:48,605
So what? You're just going
to go down there?

875
01:11:48,686 --> 01:11:51,075
Down there. How do we know
he didn't use all the ammo already.

876
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:52,440
We don't know, Frank.

877
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:25,330
It's good to know that you still have
a sense of humor in a time like this.

878
01:12:25,454 --> 01:12:26,774
I know it's not much to look at
but with any luck,

879
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:28,828
it's going to buy me enough time
to get that weapon

880
01:12:28,863 --> 01:12:30,848
and get back here
without tearing the plane apart.

881
01:12:30,935 --> 01:12:31,924
Why are you doing this?

882
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:34,735
I made a promise to someone.

883
01:12:35,616 --> 01:12:36,844
I keep my promises.

884
01:12:48,498 --> 01:12:51,218
I have radar contact with Concord 239.

885
01:12:51,859 --> 01:12:53,816
Should have visual in two minutes.

886
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,056
Burrows, in case this blows up
anything important,

887
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:01,612
do you mind
if I take out your new girlfriend?

888
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:15,020
Hey Bennett.

889
01:13:17,465 --> 01:13:18,534
Got something for you.

890
01:15:22,052 --> 01:15:25,728
Roger. Try to establish contact.
You have three minutes from my mark.

891
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,485
Mark minus three minutes.

892
01:15:28,173 --> 01:15:29,853
Roger that.
Mark minus three minutes.

893
01:15:29,888 --> 01:15:31,579
Try to establish contact.

894
01:15:31,614 --> 01:15:33,445
I'm going to circle and signal.

895
01:15:34,695 --> 01:15:35,650
Look.

896
01:15:36,455 --> 01:15:39,208
I'd like to think
that's the Calvary, but um.

897
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:40,286
What do you mean?

898
01:15:47,177 --> 01:15:48,611
We don't have much time.

899
01:15:49,138 --> 01:15:50,317
Well, aren't they going to save us?

900
01:15:50,352 --> 01:15:51,497
No. They're not going to save us.

901
01:15:51,978 --> 01:15:54,259
There's just us.
Unless we let him know we're alive,

902
01:15:54,294 --> 01:15:55,487
he's going to shoot us down.

903
01:15:55,579 --> 01:15:56,699
They can't do that.

904
01:15:56,734 --> 01:15:57,849
He's right.

905
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:00,613
Unless we answer them,
they're going to fire the missile at us.

906
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,614
What do we do?

907
01:16:02,701 --> 01:16:03,850
We answer him.

908
01:16:04,621 --> 01:16:07,694
Someone needs to get to the cockpit,
and signal that jet.

909
01:16:07,782 --> 01:16:09,295
Does anybody know how to fly a jet?

910
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:10,857
Anyone? Anyone?

911
01:16:13,063 --> 01:16:14,188
You can fly a jet?

912
01:16:14,223 --> 01:16:17,184
Well, not officially.
But I know most of the basics.

913
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:18,060
Basics?

914
01:16:18,144 --> 01:16:19,736
Of course, it's been awhile.

915
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:22,544
We just need to get to the radio and use it.

916
01:16:23,385 --> 01:16:24,613
We need to go now, Frank.

917
01:16:27,106 --> 01:16:29,071
Alright. Count me in.

918
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:31,018
No, no, no, Billy don't leave me.

919
01:16:31,107 --> 01:16:32,346
I'll go. I'll go.

920
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:33,585
No. Stay here.

921
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:34,942
I'm going to do my part.

922
01:16:36,028 --> 01:16:37,859
- Why?
- I'll see you soon, baby.

923
01:16:38,308 --> 01:16:39,298
I'll see you soon.

924
01:16:39,389 --> 01:16:40,139
Let's go.

925
01:16:43,789 --> 01:16:44,984
Such a big mouth.

926
01:17:08,235 --> 01:17:09,907
Nice drive.

927
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:27,269
Command, this is 431.

928
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:28,189
Go ahead.

929
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:30,635
239 has no one
in control that I can see.

930
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:34,235
Repeat, 239 has no one
in control that I can see.

931
01:17:47,443 --> 01:17:48,513
Billy.

932
01:17:48,604 --> 01:17:51,038
- Billy. Billy.
- Let her go.

933
01:17:54,085 --> 01:17:54,915
Billy.

934
01:18:02,767 --> 01:18:03,677
Billy.

935
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,566
Come on, baby.

936
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,563
Get out of my way, you stupid bitch!

937
01:18:32,573 --> 01:18:34,291
You don't know who you're dealing with.

938
01:18:38,694 --> 01:18:39,969
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

939
01:18:43,655 --> 01:18:45,806
Nah, nah, That's it for me.
You guys go.

940
01:18:45,896 --> 01:18:47,852
You guys go. I've got to wait for Anna.

941
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:49,211
Go. Go.

942
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,855
No response to my signals.

943
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:56,088
You are clear to engage 239.

944
01:18:56,178 --> 01:18:57,771
Command, please repeat.

945
01:18:57,859 --> 01:19:00,144
You are clear to engage 239.

946
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:03,217
Roger that.
Clear to engage contact with 239.

947
01:19:24,024 --> 01:19:25,981
Hold on, baby.

948
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:31,496
I love you.

949
01:19:32,706 --> 01:19:34,424
I love you too, baby.

950
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,620
I always have.

951
01:19:46,629 --> 01:19:47,584
Is that you Bennett?

952
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,223
Oh shit.

953
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,744
Come on mother fucker.

954
01:19:58,152 --> 01:20:01,512
I want to make sure you keep
that shit eating grin on your face

955
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:02,866
all the way to hell.

956
01:20:30,679 --> 01:20:32,988
Command, this is 431.

957
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,514
It appears
that engine number 3 is burning.

958
01:20:59,285 --> 01:21:01,082
She's gumming me to death.

959
01:21:10,927 --> 01:21:12,077
Go, go, go, go.

960
01:21:17,849 --> 01:21:18,918
Where's the auto-pilot?

961
01:21:19,009 --> 01:21:21,604
- I don't know. You asking me Frank?
- This is different.

962
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:23,487
This is different.

963
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:24,687
Don't yell at me.

964
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:25,805
I'm not yelling.

965
01:21:33,212 --> 01:21:34,042
I have lock.

966
01:21:36,573 --> 01:21:39,884
We're alive. I repeat we're alive.

967
01:21:39,974 --> 01:21:42,010
Abort. Abort.

968
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:48,211
Missile away.

969
01:21:50,176 --> 01:21:53,214
Incoming object. Incoming object.

970
01:21:53,817 --> 01:21:55,137
They must have launched a missile.

971
01:21:55,172 --> 01:21:56,022
Frank we got seconds.

972
01:21:56,057 --> 01:21:58,492
- I know. Where is the auto-pilot?
- I don't know.

973
01:21:58,578 --> 01:22:01,138
Collision imminent. Collision imminent.

974
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:06,559
Here, here.

975
01:22:06,594 --> 01:22:08,203
Auto-pilot off.

976
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:09,811
What do I do?

977
01:22:13,221 --> 01:22:14,210
- Ready.
- uh-huh

978
01:22:14,781 --> 01:22:16,146
We got live civilians.

979
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:18,252
Aborting, repeat, I am aborting.

980
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:46,817
Pull up.

981
01:22:47,628 --> 01:22:48,584
Pull up.

982
01:22:49,429 --> 01:22:50,418
Pull up.

983
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:55,466
Pull up.

984
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:57,185
Pull up.

985
01:22:58,151 --> 01:22:59,106
Pull up.

986
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:14,513
Hold on!

987
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,190
Jesus.

988
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,277
Pull up.

989
01:23:49,242 --> 01:23:50,231
Pull up.

990
01:23:52,762 --> 01:23:53,639
Pull up.

991
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:57,358
You did it, Frank.

992
01:24:11,286 --> 01:24:12,322
Oh shit.

993
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:13,758
Frank.

994
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:15,667
Frank.

995
01:24:15,702 --> 01:24:16,453
Yes.

996
01:24:16,488 --> 01:24:17,603
Mountain.

997
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:31,086
Pull back.

998
01:24:33,171 --> 01:24:33,842
Back.

999
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:40,805
Pull up. Pull up.

1000
01:25:23,182 --> 01:25:25,093
You did it my friend.

1001
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:27,703
Did you ever consider going out
with an ex-cop?

1002
01:25:27,738 --> 01:25:30,377
I went out with a cop once.

1003
01:25:31,064 --> 01:25:31,940
Oh yeah?

1004
01:25:32,384 --> 01:25:35,582
Yeah, the only thing he was good
for was scratching my back

1005
01:25:35,665 --> 01:25:36,510
when I couldn't reach.

1006
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:39,139
Do you ever get that itch anymore?

1007
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:41,283
All the time.
