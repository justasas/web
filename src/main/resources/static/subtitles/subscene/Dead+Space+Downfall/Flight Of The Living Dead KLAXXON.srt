1
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,295
How are things back there.

2
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,700
Oh it's fine, slow.
I'm glad we're only a quarter-full.

3
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,780
Yeah, same up here.

4
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,660
Did you hear something
about the weather front?

5
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,855
Yeah, these things used to bother me.

6
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,929
The weather?

7
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,059
No, that we're going
to be delayed getting into Paris.

8
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,780
Please tell me you're panning
on getting some sleep tonight.

9
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,896
I can promise you we'll be in bed early.

10
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,130
Emily why don't you go out with us.
It will be so fun.

11
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,255
Yeah, Paris at night.

12
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,251
Ze Champs Elysee. Ze clubs.

13
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,137
- Ze men with their...
- I will be busy.

14
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,415
Now if you please excuse me ladies
I have some work to do.

15
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,536
Yeah.

16
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,969
That's a hint.

17
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,370
Aye Aye.

18
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,416
So what's the deal with the special cargo?

19
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,096
It is some last minute top level
I government contractor shipment.

20
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,179
It says there's an armed guard in the hull.

21
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,409
That's a first.

22
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,533
What are we carrying?

23
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,288
I'm not sure I want to know.

24
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,575
Well, looks like all
the signatures check out

25
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,015
so we are free to take it from the S.O.C.

26
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,418
It says here if there are any
abnormalities involving the cargo area.

27
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,778
Abnormalities?

28
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,809
We are to contact
a Dr. Bennett and Dr. Sebastian.

29
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,297
These were the guys
that secured the cargo.

30
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,938
They're in first class.

31
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,460
Abnormalities?

32
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,655
I'm glad this is my last flight.

33
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,809
Yeah.

34
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,819
Lucas, you need to settle down now.

35
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,413
You're not listening.

36
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,572
We could lose Kelly
and I'm not going to let that happen.

37
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,820
Would you calm down.

38
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,809
You're making a scene.

39
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,379
Now I told you.

40
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,859
I will bring Kelly out of stasis

41
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,056
when we have a controlled environment.
Not before.

42
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,529
We all know this is highly unorthodox.

43
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,896
We had to move quickly.
This is her our, only way out.

44
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,856
Unorthodox?

45
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,249
Hey! She was dying and we saved her.

46
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,609
If we hadn't intervened, she'd be dead.
You god damn well know that.

47
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Now, were we able to reach our friend?

48
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,899
Kolinsky's made all the arrangements

49
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,936
for the transport
and we'll see him in Prague.

50
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,932
Prague?
I though we had a lab set up in Toulon.

51
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,696
Christ, our files have been hacked.
That will be the first place they look.

52
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,020
We are running out of time!

53
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,979
There have always been risks.
But think of the good we are doing.

54
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,699
We will save loved ones.
We will bring them back.

55
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,259
It's why we all have sacrificed.

56
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,217
Kelly knew the risks going into this.

57
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,940
That's easy for you to say.
That's not your wife down there.

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,532
Is it? Is it?

59
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,578
Shh, calm down. Sit down.

60
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,537
Sit down. Come on, Come on.

61
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,857
Now listen to me.
I know how you feel. I really do.

62
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,860
But do you for one minute
think I don't know what's at stake.

63
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,693
My entire company depends
on the success of this project,

64
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,977
and I am less concerned about losing
one life than I am of saving thousands.

65
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,130
So I am not going to let you,
or your wife,

66
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,973
or some petty little
Bureaucrat jeopardize this project.

67
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,210
So shut the fuck up
and get back to your seat,

68
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,336
because this subject is closed for good.

69
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,138
Are we clear on this Doctor?

70
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,059
We're clear.

71
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,050
Excuse me.

72
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,731
He's not going to let this go.

73
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,855
Don't worry about it.

74
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
Dr. Thorp will not be leaving Paris.

75
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,373
Not with us at any rate.

76
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,420
Excuse me miss,

77
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,729
I'll take a Rum and Coke please.

78
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,339
Oh, sorry Burrows. Rude of me.
Make that two.

79
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,255
Right, how bout a coke.

80
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,619
If a little bit of Bacardi were
to find its way in there,

81
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,452
it would be our little secret, huh.

82
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,060
Anything for you, Mr...?

83
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,211
Uh, Burrows, Truman.
But no thank you.

84
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,260
And I'm Frank.

85
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,057
Frank Lee Strathmore.

86
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,900
It's a name rich with tradition.
My umm, My family...

87
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,494
She doesn't need to know
your family history, Frank.

88
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,176
Look, I don't expect to be tied up long.

89
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,455
Just a couple of parking
ticket kinda things, really.

90
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,089
I mean, how bout you and I meet
at the Eiffel tower around Mid-Night...

91
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,340
I'm sorry to disappoint you but Frank here,
he's going to be a little busy.

92
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,455
That's OK.

93
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,216
Truman, if you guys
need anything, let me know.

94
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,775
Thank you.

95
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,336
OK.

96
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,370
Truman,

97
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,889
Truman.

98
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,178
Hmm. I guess that pretty
well does it for me.

99
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,768
Looks like if you play your cards right,
she could be cuffing you later.

100
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,777
You're going to shut up
and drink your coke.

101
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,340
Hi guys.

102
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,136
Hey.

103
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,420
My god you are lovely.

104
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,457
Hey stewardess. Do you think
I could get some sugar with my coffee?

105
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,779
So, is Ally packed?

106
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,809
She's been packed for five years.

107
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,734
The legendary Ray Bashore retiring.

108
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,140
So why isn't she with you
on your final flight?

109
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,815
She insisted on staying home
to get things ready for our trip.

110
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,299
So where are you two going?

111
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,610
Summer vacation with the grandkids

112
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,700
then we're on a slow ocean cruise
to Alaska. Just the two of us.

113
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,019
That's so romantic.

114
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,694
The ocean cruise maybe, but the kids?

115
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,574
Sounds like a nightmare.

116
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,456
Hey,

117
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,132
that's great Ray, really.

118
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,500
Thank you.

119
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,013
Looks bad ahead huh?

120
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,615
Um, not to worry.

121
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,620
So, I can't wait to go shopping
at Chanel in Paris.

122
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,420
Courtney says that
we have to go to Cartier first,

123
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,489
and then we can go to...

124
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,652
Yeah, well, I can't wait
to go surfing in Biarritz.

125
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,740
Surfing?

126
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,617
Oh yeah, we're going surfing.

127
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
You can go surfing.

128
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,051
Good.

129
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,980
You and that slut Jackie
can go surfing all you want.

130
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,335
Wow, hey, Tony's my friend alright?

131
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,691
We're here to surf and you know that.

132
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,740
And hey, his girlfriend's a total bitch
and you know that.

133
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,340
What the hell is it with you two?

134
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,951
I don't like her. OK?

135
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,472
Whatever. OK.

136
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,118
Whatever yourself.

137
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,700
Hey YO, Tone.

138
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,258
- Yeah?
- Gotta go long buddy.

139
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,690
Gotta go long buddy.

140
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,894
- Oh, oh, it hurts to get scored on.
- Stop it.

141
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,615
You're a child.

142
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,898
Wow, nice toss.

143
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,571
Hey!

144
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,049
I'll give it back to you
when I'm done playing with it.

145
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,175
Hey.

146
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,818
Dude, she cannot take the ball.

147
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,289
Obviously she can. Nice toss.

148
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,939
- Excuse me Mr. Freeman?
- Yes?

149
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,540
Can I get your autograph?

150
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
Ohh yeah, sure, sure.

151
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,089
That final putt on the last day
of the masters, man,

152
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,374
that was poetry.

153
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,210
Poetry huh?

154
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,980
Yes.

155
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,618
Alright there, here you go.
Thank you.

156
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,660
Thanks Mr. Freeman. Thanks a lot.

157
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,456
No problem.

158
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,171
Why can't they just leave us alone?

159
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,852
You told me this was a trip away from golf
and everything that goes with it.

160
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:29,200
I know and it is.

161
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,220
Look, I promise that for rest of the trip,

162
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,814
I'm just gonna be plain old Billy, alright?

163
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,412
You won't even know Long Shot exists.
I promise you that.

164
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,776
OK.

165
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,614
I love that smile.

166
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,300
Excuse me Mr. Freeman.

167
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,777
Yeah?

168
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,420
Captain Bashore would love
to meet you.

169
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,569
When he has a break later
in the flight,

170
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,776
would you mind
if he stops by for a visit.

171
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,978
Yeah, it's not a problem.

172
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,370
Thank you.

173
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,860
You know, while you're at it,

174
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,420
if you're done fawning over my husband,

175
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,336
I'd love another Bloody Mary.

176
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:03,980
Anna.

177
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,740
William. I'm on vacation.

178
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,060
I'll get you a drink right
away Mrs. Freeman.

179
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,016
And make sure
you put some Vodka in it this time.

180
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,380
Cause that's how I like to tee-off.

181
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,611
Hey, there's no reason
to be so rude alright.

182
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,971
You know I'm sure
there's someone back in coach

183
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,573
who hasn't got your autograph yet.

184
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,220
Maybe I'll go back there
and give it to them.

185
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,733
You knew what you were getting
into when you married me.

186
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,295
I thought I did.

187
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,976
You just keep twirling
that little putter of yours.

188
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,380
Cause that's all
you're gonna be twirling this trip.

189
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,496
Wasn't so little last night was it?

190
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,259
You know you've got the wrong man, right?

191
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,940
Yeah,

192
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,135
that's why Interpol
has your picture all over the internet.

193
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,939
It's a classic case of mistaken identity.

194
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,610
Yeah.

195
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,050
Hey.

196
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,936
Hey.

197
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,653
Burrows, you can't treat me like this.

198
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,980
I'm not guilty. It's not fair.

199
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,060
Bouncing me all over the world
to stand trial here

200
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,051
and there for something I did not do.

201
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,055
I'm not guilty.

202
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,097
I'm not guilty.

203
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,140
No, I have a clear conscience.
I'm not guilty.

204
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,936
Yeah.

205
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,170
What is it going to take
to convince you I'm innocent.

206
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,899
An act of god.

207
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,773
Now shut up before I make you eat
that flotation device you're sitting on.

208
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,694
There we go.

209
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,975
We can fly around it but not above it.
This is a huge system.

210
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,176
It's about 150 miles east
and west of course

211
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,932
so it looks like either way we go,

212
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,373
we are screwed.

213
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,850
It's either that
or we fly all the way back around,

214
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,091
but that's going to add 30 minutes
to our flight at least.

215
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,380
Paris weather is not good
for our arrival.

216
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,539
I'm gonna deviate left
and thread the needle.

217
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,620
That gap might be our only shot
of getting around...

218
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,293
...this system without landing for fuel.

219
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,857
Folks, looks like it's going
to get a little bit bumpy ahead.

220
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,620
I'd like you to remain in your seats
and wear your seatbelts.

221
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,418
We'll probably be through this
in 10 or 15 minutes.

222
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,899
Thank you very much.

223
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,652
Ohh God.

224
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,735
Did you hear that?

225
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,172
Something must have shifted and fell.

226
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,060
As you know Mr. Madison, a combined
strike team of the CIA and FBI

227
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,211
seized the head-quarters
of MEDCON Labs in Los Angeles.

228
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,211
A number of arrests were made,

229
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,540
but we've been unable to determine
the wear-a-bouts of four key individuals.

230
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,770
The first one, Dr. Leo Bennett.

231
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,818
He's a head research scientist
and founder of MEDCON.

232
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,018
Noted for his work with retro-viruses,
and synthetic biology.

233
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,490
He was investigated two years ago
for illegal cloning research,

234
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,095
unfortunately, that investigation failed
to produce any indictments.

235
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,694
So far I've seen nothing
that warrants disturbing the President.

236
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,213
Can we get to the point here?

237
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,214
Look, we're trying
to reconstruct Bennett's hard-drive,

238
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,734
and we think there is cause for alarm.

239
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,375
We believe Leo Bennett is responsible

240
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,900
for the development
of a new strain of the Malaria virus.

241
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,609
And the containment
and transportation of Dr. Kelly Thorpe.

242
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,856
Malaria?

243
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,260
Initially we thought it was Malaria.

244
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,412
However, we discovered that it was something new, something different.

245
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,131
Bennett obtained a DNA sample from a Mosquito native

246
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,620
to a remote area in Vietnam

247
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,532
which had a 100% mortality rate
within seconds,

248
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,540
which then regenerates that same organism

249
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,540
for a few seconds or longer,
depending on the subject organism.

250
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,820
What Bennett has developed is
a mutation of this same mosquito virus

251
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,060
to restart major organs
for an indefinite period of time.

252
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,133
Now what you're saying
is that his virus kills organs

253
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,653
and then brings them back to life.

254
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,968
Not just organs.

255
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,494
He apparently was experimenting
on the resurrection

256
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,969
of the entire human body after death.

257
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,618
Oh impossible. I can't go to the president with this.

258
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,780
Jerry, I mean come on.

259
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,295
From what we've uncovered,
we believe he succeeded.

260
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,369
Ah, hello?

261
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,493
What is going on?

262
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,769
What is happening to me?

263
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,935
God damn it.

264
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,413
Jesus, what now?

265
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,018
We have electrical
and communication problems.

266
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,370
We just had a temperature drop
in the cargo hold.

267
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,656
This is Concord 239 to base.

268
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,854
This is Concord 239 to base.

269
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,697
Great, no radio.

270
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,771
With this crap for the next hour.
Perfect.

271
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,737
What the hell is wrong with you?

272
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,776
I'm sick. I need help.

273
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,975
I need help.

274
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,934
I'm a scientist with MEDCON Labs.

275
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,650
Where the hell is Dr. Bennett?

276
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,976
I need to talk to someone.

277
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,688
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.

278
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,652
Come out. I won't shoot.

279
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,336
What the fuck.

280
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,729
Fuck. Where is she?

281
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,812
Oh god, oh!

282
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,018
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

283
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,415
OK.

284
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,251
Hey will you grab me a Diet Coke
on your way back?

285
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,930
Sure honey.

286
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,009
Thanks babe.

287
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,972
Check out that dime.

288
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,528
Wow, that is one hot little biatch.

289
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,900
Ouch, fuck that hurt.

290
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,969
Oh hi honey.

291
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,977
So I guess that mid-flight blowjob
is out of the question?

292
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,695
Such a dick.

293
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,849
Sweetheart?

294
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,410
What?

295
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,611
Come here.

296
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,420
What? What's wrong?

297
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,969
I mean, what is somebody sees us?

298
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,020
What are you talk...

299
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,658
we're in a bathroom
what are you talking about?

300
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,617
No l...you know what I mean.

301
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,532
You're Peter's best friend.

302
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,130
So what?

303
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,456
Oh, I'm sorry.

304
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,660
Oh, pardon me.
I didn't mean to scare you.

305
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,332
No, it's ok. I wasn't paying attention.

306
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,809
Sir, you actually need to take your seat.
The fasten seatbelt sign is on.

307
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,094
Yeah, yeah, um.

308
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,420
Can I get you some more coffee? Ok.

309
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,409
Yes, thank you.

310
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,300
You're welcome.

311
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,336
Oh, Megan, rhymes with Vegan.
I was a vegan.

312
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,620
- Yeah?
- For two days.

313
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,848
Megan Vegan.

314
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,300
It's actually "Megan".

315
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,019
Right, no, I knew that.

316
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,169
Sir, you actually need to take your seat.

317
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,693
Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah.

318
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,498
I just, you need to be more careful.

319
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,300
I mean, people sneaking up
on you like that.

320
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,858
You know, there's strange people here.

321
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,898
You never can tell what's going
to happen on these flights.

322
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,299
- Sir you need to take your seat.
- OK.

323
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,655
- Thanks, thanks. Buckle-up.
- You're welcome.

324
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,775
Jesus.

325
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,855
Ha, wow. Cool, huh?

326
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,652
Maybe this little diversion will keep
my mind off of your tasteless cheap suit.

327
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,732
Would you feel better if I was
in a bitch-ass, orange jumpsuit?

328
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,731
Like the one you are going
to be wearing the rest of your life.

329
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,380
There you go getting nasty again

330
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,018
when I am merely offering a criticism

331
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,300
of the sartorial horror show you call a suit.

332
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,179
However, I do like the shirt.
Does it come in a man's style?

333
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,169
And for your information, the jumpsuits

334
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,535
in France are a sort of burgundy. Yeah.

335
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,060
Well you should look nice in that color.

336
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,100
And now I know what color corsage

337
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,220
to get you when big Pierre
makes you his wife.

338
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,858
Someone sounds a wee bit jealous.

339
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,810
Yeah.

340
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,813
I'm going to descend a little.

341
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,009
Is it over yet?

342
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,894
Let's find out.

343
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,460
This is Randy.

344
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,688
It's Stacy.

345
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,655
I think some of the passengers
might have been hurt.

346
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,650
How bad?

347
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,100
I don't know.
It's a mess down here.

348
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,453
Well, we'll do the best we can.

349
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,775
Just stand by.

350
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,336
Looks like we're OK for a few minutes.

351
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,218
Give them the "go ahead" to check.
Let me know what's what.

352
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,249
Well folks, we apologize for the heavy
turbulence we have just experienced.

353
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,860
It appears as though
we're clear for the moment.

354
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,693
However, we are traveling
through some unstable air.

355
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,251
So as a precaution I would like you
to remain in your seats for the time being.

356
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,740
At this time, I would only like our flight
attendants up and about the cabin.

357
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,616
Thank you.

358
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,615
Would you make sure everyone's alright?

359
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,772
Then have one of the Doctors,
Bennett or Sebastian,

360
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,533
check the cargo situation out with you.

361
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,170
The cargo?

362
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,893
I'll get my tools.

363
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,535
Is she ok?

364
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,814
It's her head.

365
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,094
You alright dude. Did you take one?

366
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,330
The fucking bag hit me in the head.

367
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,217
Come on, that was fun.
It was just turbulence.

368
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,699
My god, don't be such a baby.

369
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,690
It didn't hit you.

370
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,769
Relax.

371
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,892
What is your problem girl?

372
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,289
Oh, are you scared we're going to crash?

373
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,180
Relax bitch. Enjoy the ride.

374
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,648
Wow, Jesus, pipe down you psycho.

375
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:22,977
Shut up.

376
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,694
What hell's wrong with you?

377
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,980
What?

378
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,254
You are a psycho.

379
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,729
You know, and you're a fucking skank.
I'm so sick of your shit.

380
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,860
Stop it!

381
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,578
Everyone just calm down.

382
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,218
Take your seats.

383
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,416
And you take your seats too.

384
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,455
Take your seats.

385
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,414
What is wrong with you.

386
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,700
We have several warning lights

387
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,134
we don't usually get,
even with this weather.

388
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,018
It's probably nothing,
but we should look just to see.

389
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,418
I agree, why don't you two go.

390
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,130
Both of us?

391
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,497
Right.

392
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,460
Well whoever is going,
meet me by that exit door.

393
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,098
It usually takes a few minutes
to get down there

394
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,932
and there's no easy way to go.

395
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,415
God damn it.

396
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,060
I told you. I told you both...

397
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,500
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

398
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,979
Just go check on the passenger.

399
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,215
If it was a malfunction,
Kelly might be dead.

400
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,779
Yeah listen, don't take your eye off him.

401
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,612
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

402
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,460
You guys ok?

403
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,780
I'm fine.

404
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,420
But do you think
we could move up to business class.

405
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,297
I mean, the planes really empty and all...

406
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,495
- He's kidding. We're fine.
- OK.

407
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,490
Thank you.

408
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,693
Hey, I am trying to help you out here.

409
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,100
She wants you. Make your move.

410
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,818
Go boy go.

411
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,011
I'm sorry if this is a problem.

412
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,534
No problem. I'll take care of it.

413
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,733
It could be dangerous.

414
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,219
Only if you're afraid of the dark.

415
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,418
Come on Burrows.
I need to go to the sandbox.

416
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,457
What?

417
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,450
I got to pee.

418
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,818
No, you heard the PA.
Sit down and hold it.

419
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,175
Fine.

420
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,900
If you should happen
to feel something warm,

421
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,652
just move a little to your right.

422
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,493
You're like a five year old.

423
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,572
Come on let's go.

424
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,293
Easy. Take it slow.

425
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,256
Yes, of course.

426
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,409
Burrows?

427
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,895
Burrows?

428
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,660
Mr. Burrows,

429
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,536
Truman.

430
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,010
Oh my god.

431
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,734
Alright gentleman. Here we go.

432
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,368
Truman.

433
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,369
Truman.

434
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,930
What?

435
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,852
That little shit.

436
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,300
Flight-deck.

437
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,814
Captain, this is Megan at door 4L.

438
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,460
We've got a problem back here.

439
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,371
OK. How bad is it?

440
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,530
Mr. Burrows, the cop
who brought the prisoner on board,

441
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,331
was knocked out cold,
and his prisoner is missing.

442
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,140
Excuse me, have you guys seen
a funny looking skinny guy,

443
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,573
blue sweatshirt, turtle-neck,
walk through here?

444
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,936
No.

445
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,612
No? No? Alright.

446
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,935
Well that explains
the communication problem.

447
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,649
Fry,

448
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,580
Dr. Thorp?

449
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,535
Kevin?

450
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,653
Fry's not in the jump-seat.

451
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,050
My god. This can't be happening.

452
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,620
We need to get out of her, now.

453
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,020
Come on. We need to seal
the hatch now. Let's move.

454
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,816
Come on.

455
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,298
Lucas.

456
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,780
Kelly.

457
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,815
Oh god.

458
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,291
No, no!

459
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,616
Tony?

460
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,050
Tony?

461
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,410
Asshole.

462
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,018
Don't scare me like that...

463
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,060
What? Hey, where the fuck are you going?

464
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,015
That hurts.

465
00:36:32,115 --> 00:36:34,360
And don't use that kind of
language around me.

466
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,415
Hey you two.

467
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,856
You need to be in your seats
with the belts fastened.

468
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,811
Why don't you make yourself
a fucking sandwich while you're at it.

469
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,140
What have you done?
You son of a bitch.

470
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,732
What have you brought on board?

471
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,536
Take your seats everyone. Take your seats.

472
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,736
Everyone just calm down.

473
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,094
Do you know what's going on?

474
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,329
Ray, open up.

475
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,609
What's wrong? Randy!

476
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,170
Ray, bring the plane down.

477
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,497
Ray, bring the plane down.

478
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,457
Bring the plane down right now,
or we're all going to fucking die.

479
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,332
Tell me what the hell happened down there.

480
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,368
Ray. The fucking, the fucking,

481
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,620
the fucking scientists,
they let something out of the cargo-hold.

482
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,540
What are you talking about?
Where are the doctors?

483
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,292
They're dead. Ray, they're dead...

484
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,859
- Sit down!
- Look at me man.

485
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,090
Everyone's going to fucking die.
They killed them.

486
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,932
Sit down and calm down.

487
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,019
Sit down.

488
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,859
Now. Sit down.

489
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,448
What happened to you?

490
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,808
Listen to me.
Just listen to me, Ray.

491
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,778
If you don't land this plane soon,

492
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,858
you, me, Emily, everybody
on this fucking plane is going to die.

493
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,817
You know I can't bring her down
without warning

494
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,778
and no place to land. Think about it.

495
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,329
There is something..

496
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,734
it's not human, down there man.

497
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,620
And it's going to kill everyone on board
unless we land this plane.

498
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,690
So whatever you do,
I don't care how you do it, just, just...

499
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,540
- I need you to calm down...
- Find a place, Ray,

500
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,859
and land the fucking plane.

501
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,820
- Find a piece of straight fucking road.
- You know the radio's gone,

502
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,173
and this storm isn't helping our situation.

503
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,012
It's clear we can try to cross.

504
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,011
But I'm turning around
and heading back.

505
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,860
There's a TSA man aboard.

506
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,818
Find out which passenger he is
and get him up here.

507
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,650
Now!

508
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,931
Ray.

509
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,412
Are you sure that's the guy?

510
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,689
Ok, they're dead.

511
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,533
And you say whatever killed them,
wasn't human.

512
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,771
I know it sounds insane.

513
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,700
I saw this happen.

514
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,851
I mean those things,
I mean they ripped those men apart

515
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,532
and they were eating them.

516
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,975
You said there was a fugitive on board.

517
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,820
Is it possible you saw him down there?

518
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,048
No.

519
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,220
I told you. There were two of them

520
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,974
and these...these things aren't human.

521
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,177
I'm going to go find out
what was in those containers.

522
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,454
Where are you going?

523
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,820
I'm going to go talk
to that asshole Bennett cause he knows.

524
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,775
Sit down.

525
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,378
Well, I'll check it out and report back.

526
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,615
Any sign of him?

527
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,216
No.

528
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,100
Shoot.

529
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,980
How's your head?

530
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,050
Better than my ego.

531
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,814
Come on, he can't hide forever.

532
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,539
As soon as the turbulence settles,
I'm going to go look for him some more.

533
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,620
Don't go alone.

534
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,815
Why? Is he dangerous?

535
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,209
Well, he's probably never owned
a weapon before,

536
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,733
but he's more
of a con-artist than anything.

537
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,617
What did he do? Can you tell me?

538
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,333
He posed as an accountant,

539
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:24,640
skimmed 35 millions of the Russian mob,

540
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,537
stole their Jet and crash-landed it.

541
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,259
And we finally caught up to him.
Everybody wants him.

542
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,179
Why are you taking him to Paris?

543
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,980
You ok?

544
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,856
Yes.

545
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,089
You should take your seat.

546
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,499
OK. Be careful.

547
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,217
OK

548
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,611
Hey look at this.
I think I found Concord 239.

549
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,140
Nobody's been able to reach them
for over an hour.

550
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,335
Los Angeles dispatch,
this is Yellow-Knife-Center.

551
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,378
I believe I have your concord 239
on my screen.

552
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,060
It's in the middle
of two huge weather fronts.

553
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,210
And transponder indicates it's off course.

554
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,490
No, no radio contact yet. I'll try now.

555
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,455
Concord 239, Yellow-Knife-Center.

556
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,697
Concord 239, Yellow-Knife-Center.

557
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,853
Los Angeles Dispatch,

558
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,659
yes I understand.

559
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:37,540
I repeat, you must tell 239
to return to US airspace.

560
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,100
The Canadian government
will not permit them to land

561
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,375
or continue to fly in their airspace.

562
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,132
This decision has come
from the highest level

563
00:42:44,232 --> 00:42:46,680
of the Canadian government as well as the
US State Department

564
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,532
and the CDC. Is that clear?

565
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,058
Can you tell me what it is
you're transporting in the cargo-hold?

566
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,410
I'm sorry.

567
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,970
My cargo is a highly classified project
linked to our nation's security.

568
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,933
You don't have the necessary clearance.

569
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,375
I'm with the TSA, Federal Air-Marshall.

570
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,380
I need to know what's down there.

571
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,578
Well how fortunate for us to have a man
with your obvious talents aboard.

572
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,769
You seem a bit nervous Doc.

573
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,213
Is everything alright?

574
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,894
Just don't like flying.

575
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,980
Isn't it true your
two colleagues accompanied

576
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,175
the co-pilot down to the cargo-hold

577
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,773
because there was some problem.

578
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,610
No, no problem.

579
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,940
No problem?

580
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,453
It's just a routine mid-flight inspection.

581
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,973
Routine.

582
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,812
What I can tell you,

583
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,580
while the cargo isn't dangerous,

584
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,777
it's highly perishable
and extremely valuable.

585
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,977
So, the cargo area is off limits
to unauthorized personnel.

586
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,049
- Well, can you tell me...
- No, I'm sorry.

587
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,937
I've said more
than I should have already.

588
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,656
Burrows?

589
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,420
Yeah.

590
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,129
Paul Judd, TSA. I believe
your prisoner is in the cargo-hold.

591
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,696
Ready?

592
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,776
Hey Frank.

593
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:47,851
Frank.

594
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,970
Frank. Get out here.

595
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,209
Dr. Thorp.

596
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,699
Dr. Sebastian.

597
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,175
Anybody out there?

598
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,808
That's a lot of blood.

599
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,580
Somebody's in trouble.

600
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,696
Yeah, if it's Frank's
he needs help now.

601
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,330
Check that out.

602
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,772
Looks like he escaped
through the ducts.

603
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,690
I don't know.

604
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,288
That's an awful lot of blood
for a skinny little shit like Frank.

605
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,579
You go that way. I'll go this way.

606
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,459
Meet back in 5.

607
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,336
Yes.

608
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,289
Hey Frank.

609
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,168
You there buddy?

610
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,696
Why don't you come out
and talk to me, man?

611
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,012
Everything's alright. It's cool.

612
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,052
We can just talk. It's just me.

613
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,289
Frankie.

614
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,372
I'm going to kill that little shit.

615
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,378
Alright, I'm coming up.

616
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,576
Yes.

617
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,615
You're sure?

618
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,650
Outstanding.

619
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,329
Thank you Lieutenant.

620
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,540
They have located Bennett and his team.

621
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:01,814
Hallelujah.

622
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,818
You know Frank,
sometimes this job is really boring.

623
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,257
This is not one of those times, bud.

624
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,138
You're making this real exciting.

625
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,094
Son of a bitch.

626
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,736
Paul?

627
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,410
Frank?

628
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,776
Oh my god.

629
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,815
Oh my god I'm going to be sick.

630
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,130
Oh my god.
Cara where the fuck are you going.

631
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,733
What the fuck?

632
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,936
Tony, this bitch just got shot dude.

633
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,056
There's fucking bullets coming
from somewhere.

634
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,620
Please take your seats.

635
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,531
Take your seats. Everything's fine.

636
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,735
Please, take your seats.

637
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,220
Everything's fine.

638
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,096
Thank you.

639
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,419
Ray, it's total chaos down here.

640
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,539
There were gunshots or something
that freaked out the passengers.

641
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,090
Emily?

642
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,379
Go, take the gun.

643
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,295
My god, this can't be happening.

644
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,732
Get back.
Go back to your seats and stay there.

645
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,450
Go back.

646
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,059
Move, move, move, move.

647
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,136
Get out of my way.

648
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,938
Cara. Cara.

649
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,220
Cara, open the door.

650
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:27,891
Move.

651
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,696
Cara.

652
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,975
Oh shit.

653
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,175
Dude, what the fuck?

654
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,057
Get back. Get back. Get back.

655
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:43,811
Get back.

656
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,652
Get out of here. Get out of here.

657
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,490
Cara.

658
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,730
- Stay back there. Stay back there.
- Cara.

659
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,100
What the fuck, dude?

660
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,896
What is this?

661
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,095
- Christ.
- Holy shit.

662
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,772
Get off him. Get off him.

663
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,210
What the fuck? What the fuck?

664
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,219
What the fuck is going on?

665
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,979
Please, please,

666
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,978
please go back to your seats.

667
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,780
Oh my god.

668
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,576
Oh my god.

669
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,251
Oh my god.

670
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,740
Oh my god, what happened?

671
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,049
What the fuck happened?

672
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,577
Please take your seats.

673
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,615
Flight-deck.

674
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,930
Ray, something's happened down here.

675
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,769
Something attacked one
of the passengers, and he's dead.

676
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,612
You got to get us down, Ray.

677
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,735
Oh my god.

678
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,540
- Megan, listen to me.
- You don't understand.

679
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,212
There's blood everywhere.

680
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,770
And, and Stacy
and one of the other passengers was hurt.

681
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,259
How did it happen?
Who attacked you?

682
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,820
I don't know,
um, maybe the escaped prisoner.

683
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,014
I can't think of anyone else.

684
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,060
Look, Megan

685
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,699
we've turned around and we'll land
the first place we can find.

686
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,374
But the only way back is through
the center of the storm.

687
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,098
We need to get the passengers
back to their seats now.

688
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,735
OK.

689
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,175
I'm scared Meg.

690
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,529
Oh, my god!

691
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,536
Shit.

692
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,493
Help me.

693
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,050
Open.

694
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,651
Oh, shit.
They're going to kill us all.

695
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,731
I really should go check
on the passengers.

696
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,769
Open this door.

697
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:45,700
Help me.

698
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,736
For Christ's sake, they are going to kills us all.

699
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,460
Open the fucking door.

700
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,859
God damn it. Help me.

701
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,450
Bill?

702
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:39,810
Hey. What's going on?

703
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,860
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- What's going on man?

704
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,930
I can't explain.
We've got to get out of here.

705
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:49,616
- They're going to kill us.
- Calm down and tell me what's going on.

706
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,780
What is going on, man?

707
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,895
We need to hide.

708
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,660
We need to hide.

709
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,254
We need to get out of here,
or we're going to die.

710
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,372
Bill, where are you going?

711
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,888
Come on, come on.

712
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:05,900
Where?

713
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,733
Back-galley. The floors 2 feet thick.
It's the only safe place.

714
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,094
I can't, I can't my wife is upstairs.

715
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,100
Well get her and get back
there as soon as you can.

716
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,215
Come on, now. Come on.

717
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,653
Hey you, come on.

718
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,253
- Help me get this open.
- Tell me something.

719
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,379
It's the only place we can find.

720
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,495
Shh, shh, be quiet.

721
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,780
Hey, you, you get in there.
See if you can see anything.

722
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,099
Go on. Get up. Get up.

723
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,857
See anything?

724
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,860
Help me!

725
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,339
Come on baby.

726
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,530
Come on...

727
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,335
Stacy!

728
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:31,600
Duck!

729
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,060
Oh my god.

730
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,652
Are you alright? No bites?

731
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,219
We thought. We thought...

732
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,740
What? That it was me gnawing
on all the passengers?

733
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,378
No. I'm a vegetarian.

734
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,139
The overall feeling among the scientists

735
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,338
working on this is that we are dealing
with a serum transfer virus.

736
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,208
This virus is without
a known vaccine or cure.

737
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,538
But this type virus transfers
only through bodily fluids.

738
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,817
And then most effectively,
blood from an infect victim.

739
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,940
And it enters a cut or saliva.

740
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,140
The MEDCON scientists believed
they could make this work,

741
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,779
despite the side-effects.
That of being brought back from the dead.

742
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,540
In fact, they looked
at these side-effects as a benefit.

743
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,089
Let me paraphrase these notes
that we found on Dr. Bennett's desk.

744
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:47,048
They wanted this virus as a bio-weapon.

745
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,580
To keep soldiers fighting
after they've been mortally wounded.

746
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:55,210
To release a captive enemy infected
with the virus and let him infect others

747
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,449
until they all kill each other.

748
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:03,008
I'm going to recommend
to you and to the president

749
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:07,533
that we destroy flight 239
before it can reach a populated area.

750
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,369
Let me get this straight.

751
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:11,580
You want our forces to follow a shoot

752
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,094
to kill order regarding
a civilian aircraft?

753
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,292
We've had no communication with the aircraft.

754
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,408
We must assume the cargo has been breached

755
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,855
and that the virus has spread
throughout the passenger section.

756
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,453
The only chance we have to contain

757
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,453
this is to vaporize every living thing aboard that aircraft.

758
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,498
Before the virus can reach
a major population center.

759
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,813
Do you concur?

760
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:35,855
I'm afraid I do.

761
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,178
Can you get me the president please?

762
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,733
Mother of god.

763
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,220
Get off of her. Get off.

764
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,050
Get off.

765
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,569
Oh my god.

766
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,410
Why? Why'd you do this huh?

767
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,940
Hey, I'm talking to you, man.

768
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,137
It wasn't me.
I was just following orders.

769
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:07,900
They told me it was
an experiment to extend life.

770
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,780
I had no idea there
would be these crazy side-effects.

771
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,420
Well look around you asshole.

772
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,570
Your side-effects
have eaten half the passengers.

773
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,220
Hey, I don't have to listen to you.

774
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,575
You were the one that seemed
like you were giving all the orders.

775
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,775
You were the one
that the cop was talking to.

776
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:20,815
And you were the one
that sent the others below.

777
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,889
I heard all of that.

778
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,129
You don't know
what you're talking about.

779
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,369
It wasn't me I tell you.

780
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,688
Hey, keep your voice down.

781
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:29,059
Well you just keep talking.
You'll draw their attention.

782
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,100
It's starting
to get really tight in here.

783
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,091
Yeah, yeah,
I think we're getting closer.

784
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:11,411
Ray. Ray, I'm hurt.

785
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,933
Open up. Hurry.

786
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,690
Ray.

787
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:17,850
Hurry.

788
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,216
Oh my god.

789
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,495
I don't know if that's going to work.

790
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,729
It has to work.

791
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,853
Let's get the other side.

792
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,690
OK.

793
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:23,219
Two in the chest.
One in the balls. That's what I say.

794
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:25,815
It's barricaded.

795
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,173
Ah, Frank I see you.

796
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,334
You get that?
He is a little beaver.

797
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,655
Come on.

798
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,294
- Oh my god.
- Come here Frank.

799
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,374
Where have you been?

800
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:57,460
Where have I been?

801
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,256
Where have you been?

802
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:58,900
Where have you been?

803
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,209
- I have been up and down this plane looking
- So have l.

804
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,050
Hey, back off.

805
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:36,220
Statistically speaking, the tail section
is the safest place to be in a crash.

806
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,812
- Of course, no one...
- Frank, not now.

807
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,128
Help me with this.

808
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,653
Go get something else.

809
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:47,620
- Get something else.
- I am.

810
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,609
Do it.

811
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,019
Right there.

812
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,211
I can't lift. There's a... wait.

813
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:55,330
Frank.

814
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,774
Wait, wait, wait, shh.

815
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,215
Quiet, quiet. I hear something.

816
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,129
I don't hear anything.

817
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:13,616
Go.

818
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:24,252
Hold on. Hold on.

819
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,254
Oh my god, baby.

820
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,140
OK, we got to go. We got to go.

821
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:46,811
We got to go.

822
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,333
Go, go, go, go.

823
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,255
Alright, we need to find anything
that can be used as a weapon.

824
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,492
Does anyone have anything sharp.

825
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,700
They confiscated my toenail-clippers.

826
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,772
Pearl handled with
matching tweezers. Quite lovely.

827
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,140
Damn Frank, you should have brought those.

828
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:01,970
You could have saved the day.

829
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:02,900
You never know.

830
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,460
How much ammunition do you have left?

831
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,815
I got five in here and one clip.
What about you?

832
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,572
One full clip. Five more.

833
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,536
Shit.

834
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,177
Maybe we could electrocute
the bastards.

835
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,488
- No, no.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

836
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,813
I guess that could have gone better.

837
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:25,293
Frank, you stupid shit.
Please tell me you're dead.

838
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,849
Where'd you find him?

839
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:37,050
The auxiliary lights...

840
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:37,980
Oh my god.

841
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:42,098
The auxiliary lights will come
on any second. I hope.

842
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,099
Frank. We need to find weapons.

843
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,099
Still no answer from the cockpit?

844
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:04,010
Nothing.

845
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,448
I can't believe everyone's dead.

846
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,893
My god, we're going to die.

847
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:11,289
Megan. Listen to me. Listen to me.

848
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,699
- We are not going to die...
- No?

849
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,657
No, we're not going to die.
I promise you.

850
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,532
I need your help.
I need you to be strong.

851
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,211
Right.

852
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,369
Did you see that?

853
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,609
What the hell was that?

854
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,416
Listen.

855
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:53,170
Someone's up there.

856
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,650
Don't shoot.

857
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,451
We need to have a plan to get
this plane down safely.

858
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,178
Does anyone know
if the pilot's still alive?

859
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,375
I, I tried to reach him.

860
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:19,370
Try him again.

861
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,451
OK.

862
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,899
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

863
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,811
The captain is dead.
We're on auto-pilot.

864
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:35,730
So what,

865
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:37,253
- we just fly around till they get us?
- - No.

866
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,531
Or until we run out of fuel.
Actually, that might be preferred.

867
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:41,889
- Run out of fuel?
- Yeah.

868
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,857
Hey, we got to get to the flight-deck
to check on the captain.

869
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:45,620
We got to do this now before
they start coming at us.

870
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,380
I don't think you have enough bullets
to make it to the cockpit.

871
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,211
The guard down below has a weapon.

872
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,130
We need that weapon.

873
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,260
That's our only chance.
- Absolutely.

874
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,659
So what? You're just going
to go down there?

875
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:55,129
Down there. How do we know
he didn't use all the ammo already.

876
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,494
We don't know, Frank.

877
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:29,377
It's good to know that you still have
a sense of humor in a time like this.

878
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,460
I know it's not much to look at
but with any luck,

879
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,140
it's going to buy me enough time
to get that weapon

880
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,893
and get back here
without tearing the plane apart.

881
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:35,969
Why are you doing this?

882
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:38,779
I made a promise to someone.

883
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,888
I keep my promises.

884
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:55,259
I have radar contact with Concord 239.

885
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,856
Should have visual in two minutes.

886
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,820
Burrows, in case this blows up
anything important,

887
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,651
do you mind
if I take out your new girlfriend?

888
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,056
Hey Bennett.

889
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,569
Got something for you.

890
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:29,735
Roger. Try to establish contact.
You have three minutes from my mark.

891
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,492
Mark minus three minutes.

892
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,860
Roger that.
Mark minus three minutes.

893
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:35,620
Try to establish contact.

894
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:37,451
I'm going to circle and signal.

895
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,655
Look.

896
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:43,213
I'd like to think
that's the Calvary, but um.

897
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,290
What do you mean?

898
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,613
We don't have much time.

899
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,020
Well, aren't they going to save us?

900
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,499
No. They're not going to save us.

901
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,260
There's just us.
Unless we let him know we're alive,

902
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,488
he's going to shoot us down.

903
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:00,700
They can't do that.

904
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:01,849
He's right.

905
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:04,613
Unless we answer them,
they're going to fire the missile at us.

906
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,613
What do we do?

907
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,849
We answer him.

908
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,692
Someone needs to get to the cockpit,
and signal that jet.

909
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,293
Does anybody know how to fly a jet?

910
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:14,855
Anyone? Anyone?

911
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,220
You can fly a jet?

912
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:21,180
Well, not officially.
But I know most of the basics.

913
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:22,056
Basics?

914
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,732
Of course, it's been awhile.

915
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,539
We just need to get to the radio and use it.

916
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,608
We need to go now, Frank.

917
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,100
Alright. Count me in.

918
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,011
No, no, no, Billy don't leave me.

919
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:35,940
I'll go. I'll go.

920
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,578
No. Stay here.

921
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:38,934
I'm going to do my part.

922
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,851
- Why?
- I'll see you soon, baby.

923
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,289
I'll see you soon.

924
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:44,130
Let's go.

925
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,974
Such a big mouth.

926
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:13,892
Nice drive.

927
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,250
Command, this is 431.

928
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:32,170
Go ahead.

929
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,615
239 has no one
in control that I can see.

930
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:38,215
Repeat, 239 has no one
in control that I can see.

931
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:52,489
Billy.

932
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:55,014
- Billy. Billy.
- Let her go.

933
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:58,890
Billy.

934
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:07,650
Billy.

935
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,539
Come on, baby.

936
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,533
Get out of my way, you stupid bitch!

937
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,258
You don't know who you're dealing with.

938
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:43,934
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

939
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,770
Nah, nah, That's it for me.
You guys go.

940
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,816
You guys go. I've got to wait for Anna.

941
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,174
Go. Go.

942
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,817
No response to my signals.

943
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,050
You are clear to engage 239.

944
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:01,732
Command, please repeat.

945
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,140
You are clear to engage 239.

946
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,177
Roger that.
Clear to engage contact with 239.

947
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,936
Hold on, baby.

948
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:35,450
I love you.

949
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:38,378
I love you too, baby.

950
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,573
I always have.

951
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:51,535
Is that you Bennett?

952
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,173
Oh shit.

953
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,693
Come on mother fucker.

954
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,460
I want to make sure you keep
that shit eating grin on your face

955
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:06,813
all the way to hell.

956
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,929
Command, this is 431.

957
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,454
It appears
that engine number 3 is burning.

958
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:05,017
She's gumming me to death.

959
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,009
Go, go, go, go.

960
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,849
Where's the auto-pilot?

961
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:25,534
- I don't know. You asking me Frank?
- This is different.

962
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:27,417
This is different.

963
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,460
Don't yell at me.

964
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:29,734
I'm not yelling.

965
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:37,970
I have lock.

966
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,810
We're alive. I repeat we're alive.

967
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,936
Abort. Abort.

968
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,136
Missile away.

969
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:57,137
Incoming object. Incoming object.

970
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:59,060
They must have launched a missile.

971
01:21:59,060 --> 01:21:59,980
Frank we got seconds.

972
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:02,414
- I know. Where is the auto-pilot?
- I don't know.

973
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,060
Collision imminent. Collision imminent.

974
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,020
Here, here.

975
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,820
Auto-pilot off.

976
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,731
What do I do?

977
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,129
- Ready.
- uh-huh

978
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,100
We got live civilians.

979
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,170
Aborting, repeat, I am aborting.

980
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,729
Pull up.

981
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,495
Pull up.

982
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,329
Pull up.

983
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,376
Pull up.

984
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,095
Pull up.

985
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,015
Pull up.

986
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:18,419
Hold on!

987
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:46,090
Jesus.

988
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,176
Pull up.

989
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:54,129
Pull up.

990
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:57,536
Pull up.

991
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:01,255
You did it, Frank.

992
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,215
Oh shit.

993
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:17,651
Frank.

994
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:19,540
Frank.

995
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:20,380
Yes.

996
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:21,495
Mountain.

997
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:34,975
Pull back.

998
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:37,731
Back.

999
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,692
Pull up. Pull up.

1000
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,971
You did it my friend.

1001
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,580
Did you ever consider going out
with an ex-cop?

1002
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:34,253
I went out with a cop once.

1003
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:35,816
Oh yeah?

1004
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:39,457
Yeah, the only thing he was good
for was scratching my back

1005
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:40,420
when I couldn't reach.

1006
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,014
Do you ever get that itch anymore?

1007
01:25:44,476 --> 01:25:45,157
All the time.
