Martin, can you hear me?

40
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:56,167
Hello, Martin.
Welcome back.

41
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,500
Martin, you crashed your car.

42
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:03,667
A nasty crash.
You are lucky to be alive.

43
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:07,250
There is more than one can say
about your friends.

44
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,917
Have you seen

45
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:17,750
Have you seen creatures?

46
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,875
The things

47
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:27,042
Have the police caught them?
Or the army?

48
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,083
Roy and Erlend?

49
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,958
- Hanna?
- We found friends. All of them.

50
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:41,125
Dead.
Hanna was your girlfriend, right?

51
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:44,708
Very beautiful.
We found her too.

52
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,167
With an ax driven into the neck.

53
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,917
And your fingerprints on the shaft.

54
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,875
Do you have any idea
how that could happen?

55
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,708
They came up from

56
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:03,583
From the snow. Creatures. Nazi.
We stuck, but

57
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,250
Nazis coming out of the ground?
Absurd.

58
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:12,042
Are you sure
that he has brain damage?

59
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:18,083
Please call the family and say he is awakened.
Ask the Attorney send a car.

60
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,542
And four additional men. You are
ready to be transported.

61
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:26,208
They are out there yet. They will kill
again if we do not stop them.

62
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,708
We should not stop anyone.
I've seen what you've done.

63
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:36,125
- You'll be right in jail.
- No one knows what happened there.

64
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:40,167
Only you know that.
And it's not just bad news.

65
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:45,833
When we found you, you were badly injured.
Your right arm was torn across.

66
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,167
- It was not torn
- When we found you, it was cold.

67
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,750
The snow had chilled all,
and it was very good.

68
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:57,917
- And then we found the arm in the car.
- In the car?

69
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:02,792
It was slightly bruised and quite pale,
bit strange, basically, -

70
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,333
- But the operation was a success.

71
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,542
We managed to stick your arm again.

72
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,875
No, no, no

73
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:31,875
- It's not my arm.
- Relax.

74
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:35,917
It is Satan's arm!
It is Satan's arm!

75
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,500
Calm down.

76
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,667
No, it's not me!

77
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:55,250
No!

78
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,625
It's not me!
What the hell ...?

79
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,292
Stop!

80
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,375
Randi?

81
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:09,375
You need to settle down
removing the denture later.

82
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:12,667
Tonight I'm ready for a little hue.

83
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:52,208
From him that got away.

84
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,458
Nameless GERMAN SOLDIERS
WHO FELL IN WAR

85
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,792
Bakken.

86
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,750
Warm.

87
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,208
The men have rotted.

88
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,875
We need more people.

89
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,000
Fittelås!

90
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,125
You scared me, Nils.

I can no more nonsense.
I have been a damn long day.

92
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:45,292
A wedding, a funeral

She's one confirmant
was the damn fine, then.

94
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,833
If only I had been ten years younger -

95
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,042
- And not a priest, of course

96
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,208
Nils?

97
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,250

103
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,417

i mean daniel thats a long way to go to find out if it's a hoax?

175
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,958
You saw the picture.

176
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:51,292
This is a bonifid infected arm, you know this.

177
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:55,583
All the signs are there guys
the decayed skin, the rotten Rotten hair,the dark blood.

178
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,500
- This is real guys it's real.

179
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:02,917

Of course it will be dangerous!

180
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:08,417
but this is what we've been waiting for
this is our chance to prove to everyone that we were right

181
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:13,625
i mean we've been telling everyone
for years that it's just a matter of time -

182
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,958
-before the first outbreak happens.
And what have seen in return?

183
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:22,125
Laughter. ridicule.

184
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,458

185
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:29,917

187
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:39,625

00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:10,167
I am in the winter.
The DST system -

203
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,708
- Is completely idiotic.
What do you have?

204
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:18,417
Not much. The boy at Petra

208
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,833
Not Olsen. Shoot the dog!

209
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,625
So we have lectures to school
about the harms of using marijuana.

210
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:38,250
<i>boring! </i>

211
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:43,083
There was one thing, though.
From Øksfjord.

212
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:47,000
Øksfjord?
It is not our district.

213
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:51,708
Martin Hykkerud
escaped from the hospital yesterday.

214
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:56,625
Martin Hykkerud? the guy who killed
his friends on top of the mountain?

215
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes. He escaped yesterday and killed
a little boy and a policeman -

216
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,875
- By throwing a Mercedes star
in the face at him.

217
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,750
- Kutta the Mercedes star?
- Yes.

218
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:12,833

Sent a team up?
Extra people?

00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:30,708
I do not even have money to buy
new batteries for the cars.

224
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,708
Okay. Right.

225
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,458

226
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:41,917

227
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,708

Best for you if you continue.

242
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,583
This is a war museum, right?

243
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,917
Yes.

244
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,792
Yes, and

245
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:53,667
Do you have any information
about the Germans?

246
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,417
Help!

247
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,833
Listen to me!

248
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:13,083
I do not have time for this.
They come, and we must stop them!

249
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,875

250
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,833
Just help me.
Please.

251
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,958
- Do you have information about Einsatz?
- Yes.

252
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,542
- Second floor.
- Second floor.

253
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:43,042
Where the hell are you?

254
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,542
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

255
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:58,458
Buddy with Hitler.

256
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:02,875
- Nice, huh?
- Do not touch the exhibits.

257
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,042
"Herzog was made commander of Einsatz in 1942.

258
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:12,167
and was sent to the far north of norway
in order to protect the warships -

259
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,875
- that the German navy was hiding in the fjords.

260
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:23,000
He was on duty in Øksfjord doing a routine inspection on the ship
Scharnolsht, when

261
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,750
Scharnholst.

262
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:32,167
When Tirpitz, the German
fleets biggest warship, -

263
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:36,083
- Was attacked
by english bombers in Talvik -

264
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:41,417
- After getting vital information on the ships location
from norwegian spies.

265
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:45,458
Hitler, humiliated by the attack on Tirpitz
- ordered Herzog

266
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:51,625
-to wipe out all the the 800
men and people who lived in talvik at the time. "

267
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:57,417
Was he
He was on his way?

268
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:03,792
He was on his way to Talvik the evening
they were slaughtered in Øksfjord?

269
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,875
On behalf of Hitler.

270
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:16,750
A mission that was never completed.
It is. Exactly what is it.

271
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,917
They will destroy Talvik.

272
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,667
where

273
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:33,083
Herzog was going from Øksfjord -

274
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:35,458
- Which is here.

275
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:38,667
And he was going to talvik.

276
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,208
It's here.

277
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,250
Where are we now?

278
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,917
Where are we now?!

279
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,875
Here.

280
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:52,833
Isnestoften.

281
00:37:56,667 --> 00:38:00,250
It is in between.

282
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,583
(screaming outside)

283
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:47,208
They are recruiting!

284
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:52,500
They make new soldiers.
Can they do that? Fuck!

285
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:55,750
Okay, they come here.
There're coming now.

286
00:39:55,917 --> 00:40:00,625
I will not die in a museum
with a guy in a green jogging suit.

287
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:03,417
Calm down.
You will die.

288
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,458
But relax.
Not today.

289
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,208
There!

290
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,917
Let see
what this thing can do.

291
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,917
What thing?

292
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,792
What did you do?
You killed them only with your hand

293
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,750
It's arm, man.

294
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:46,750
Before I could not control it,
but now makes it known what I think.

295
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,417
You're not even sweating.

296
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:52,167
Do not worry about it.

297
00:42:57,167 --> 00:43:01,917
They build bigger.
Damn much larger.

298
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:05,000
There are too many
through the arm.

299
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,250
So much death.

300
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:38,417
All this unnecessary death.

301
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,917
(whimpering)

302
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:10,083
Fuck!

303
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:14,083
You did what he fucker
in the place. You just

304
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,500
- You
- No, it was the arm. It was the arm.

305
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,875
He does not attack

306
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:01,583
Did you see that?did you see that
I hit it!

307
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,042

314
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,500

316
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,167

00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:40,083
- i cant believe it.

318
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,458

We are more professional than this.

319
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:47,625
-you're the Zombie Squad?
- Yep.

320
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:50,208
- You're the Zombie Squad?.
- Yeah, we are the zombie squad

321
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:54,417
i'm sorry.
I just expected something different.

322
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:58,792
so was this guy
when he woke up this morning.

323
00:46:01,042 --> 00:46:03,500
Because I hit him in the face
with an ax.

324
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:07,083
- yeah how did you find me?
- we tracked your iphone, of course.

325
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,833
We're fucking nerds.
this is what we do technical shit, lets cut the chit chat

326
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,208
What did you find out?
What do the creatures want?

327
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,375
Revenge.

328
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:25,125
(engine noise)

329
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,958
this is insane!

330
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,292
You? you have the gift?

331
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:34,292
The force is strong with this one.

332
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,167
ok

333
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:44,583
Martin,
this is how we defeat them,
this is how we take them down

334
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,125
- What do you mean?
- I mean

335
00:47:49,417 --> 00:47:51,708
We create an army of our own.

336
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,708
I tried to get as much infomation as i could on the trip over.

337
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:59,542
Especially about Herzog. To defeat
your enemy, you must know you enemy.

338
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:03,083
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
of the Soviet army.

339
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,750
Him and his battalion
was captured during the battle of Kursk.

340
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,750
and brought here to the north of norway as pow's.

341
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:13,417
In 1944 they were all sent
to Kvenang mountain -

342
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:16,000
-to build a road through the mountain pass.

343
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:21,000
but it was after they built the road that shit got ugly.

344
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:26,625
All of the prisoners were shot.
Shot to death!

345
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:29,625
No survivors.

346
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:33,250
And the man in charge

347
00:48:33,417 --> 00:48:35,167
Herzog.

348
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,667
Those bodies are still buried there.

349
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:44,500
Buried in the frozen soil.
Preserved, waiting.

350
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:51,208
- waiting for what?
- for he same thing that drives Herzog.

351
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:55,875
Revenge.
-and guess who's gonna
give it to them.

352
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:01,917
- the man who can raise the dead?
- kerfuckin ...!

353
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:06,875
you guys go after Herzog try and slow him down,
give us as much time as possible. ok?

354
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:09,750
- And what if this doesnt work?
- It has too.

355
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:13,250
all we have to do is get to Kvenang mountain,
find stavarin wake him back from the dead -

356
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,875
- then bring him back to Talvik
so he can help us fight Herzog and his men.

357
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:20,333
Lett. Besides

358
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,708
we got help.

359
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:32,000
here we go.

360
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,167
He is our last hope.

361
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,625
look, a tank.

362
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:18,667
(a sound from outside)

363
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:22,500
- a Visitor now?
- It's early.

364
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:39,000
(sound)

365
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:40,875
Hello?

366
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,875
(baby crying)

367
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,708
Look,
his army is growing bigger.

368
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:57,250
glenn are there more towns or villages
before he reaches talvik

369
00:51:57,417 --> 00:52:02,208
- maybe a few houses but thats it
- Good. so what he has now he'll use for his attack.

370
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:06,833
yeah pretty much
that is untill he starts dealing with people of Talvik bekim and journhim as well.

371
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,250
- How many people live in talvik?
- about 3000.

372
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:14,375
- Holy shit!
- all the more reason for us to slow them down as much as we can.

373
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:21,292
- look do you know how to use one of those things?
- of course. I'm from northern Norway arent i.

374
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:25,000
I dont know what that means, ok
guys pack light.

375
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:27,708
we're moving out, now!

376
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:36,958
What the deepest in hell
happened here?

377
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:39,875
What do engineers?

378
00:52:40,042 --> 00:52:43,833
It is not technical,
Only Tom and Ole in a white coat.

379
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,333
The thought
so a little more professionally out.

380
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:51,500
NCIS should be herein night.

381
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:56,208
- Do we have any witnesses?
- If you get the seagulls to chat happily.

382
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:59,833
Gulls, yes.
Then you have a damn good invention.

383
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
A gadget that translates
seagull language to human language.

384
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:07,417
He who finds a way
will be fucking rich.

385
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,833
Get the bodies out of Talvik
before the gulls eat them up.

386
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,125
And take pictures, otherwise
NCIS will cut off my balls.

387
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:20,083
Here are pictures
from the surveillance camera.

388
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,625
Is not that where ...?

389
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:33,333
To me at the head of guttefitta mi.

390
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:41,458
Okay, guys, guys!
We are in a hurry. Come on!

391
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,250
Come on, man!
We have things to do!

392
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:49,875
There they are.
And they have a tank i see.

393
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:52,833
Yes, they stole it from the museum.

394
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,417
ah Fuck!

395
00:53:56,958 --> 00:54:01,208
- What is that?
- A large-ass tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

396
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:04,125
No,no,no,no,no
That. What is that?

397
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:08,958
oh these are replica's of the binoculars
Han and Chewie used on the planet Hoth.

398
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:13,208
Did you guys know ...fun fact all of the hoth scenes,
-sssshhhhhh

399
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,500
- Were filmed here in Norway.
this place called Finse.

400
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:22,708
girls Could we please maybe focus on you know the Nazi zombies instead?

401
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:27,375
- What do we do?
- well Daniel told us to slow them down, so thats what we're gonna do.

402
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:29,333
Look.

403
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:34,708
We need to get out there,
get their attention and then lure them into the swamps, right?

404
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:40,167
And then when they get stuck,
we can use the fertilizer bombs we made and blow them into bits and pieces.

405
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,583
thats sounds basically impossible.

406
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,500
And how were you planning on luring them out there?
We need bait. Live bait.

407
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:50,125
yes we need someone to attract their attention,

408
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:53,125
someOne who is light on their feet.

409
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:58,042
who knows these swamps
and can move through them without getting stuck.

410
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,917
What?

411
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,792
No.

412
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:11,000
No.

413
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:15,042

and one more thing, those things -

414
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:18,333
- are fucking zombies
who wants to rip my face off!

415
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,458

416
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:25,208

- You must have people you love there?.

417
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:30,125
Yeah. especially one ma ...
woman that I love.

418
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:36,208
- With long hair and big breasts.

419
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:40,708

and we'll do the rest. Capeesh?

420
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:52,625

422
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,000
yeah yeah.

423
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:02,958
First, we wake up a battalion of Nazi zombies -

424
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:07,208
- And now I'm supposed to wake up a bunch of dead russian guys

425
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:10,208

426
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:14,417

take down Herzog at this point remember that.

427
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,667
if we dont succeed -

428
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:21,625

443
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:40,667
no no it's ok we got their attention,

USA, USA!

455
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,708
USA!

456
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:09,958
Shoot.

457
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,458
Hey. that tank is moving.

458
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:28,500
that cant be good.

459
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:43,625
Run!

460
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:50,042
Run!

461
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,625
oh My God!

462
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,542
Talvik. Now.

463
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,333
Hey.

464
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,458
- Where are we?
- We're getting close.

465
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,833
But we're also stuck.

466
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:38,250
- Can I push it?
- I dont, i dont think that will help.

467
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:42,875
- Is it far? We could walk.
- We dont have that kind of time.

468
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:48,000
i mean If only we could find something -

469
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:52,167
- to put under the car you know
something that would give us traction.

470
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:55,083
Then I could get us out of here.

471
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,917
(whimpering scared)

472
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,042
- There you are, yes.
- Satan lives to accommodate all equal.

473
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:53,917
The dress is absolutely stuffed full.
We had to throw the rest in the garage.

474
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:57,583
- Sounds like a perfect solution.
- Thank you.

475
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:03,708
Most Germans and French.
Hardly the vacation they envisioned.

476
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:07,542
To get worn off his head and arms
and get entrails torn out?

477
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:10,417
Unless they like that kind of kinky stuff.

478
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:18,667
- Should you do that?
- No.

479
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:21,917
- Should not NCIS been here now?
- It gave a lot in Alta.

480
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:26,208
The plane could not land.
They are here in the morning, they say.

481
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,250
- It's perfect.
- What?

482
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:36,167
It's our chance.

483
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:40,125
Now, we fucking show people
what we're made of here.

484
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:45,000
We here at Talvik Police
find Martin Hykkerud itself.

485
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:49,375
We get him. Vi.
We will be heroes.

486
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:53,500
Not the goddamn suit-clad,
homofriserte -

487
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:57,083
- Sushi-eating hestkukene south.

488
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:00,208
Beef boys

489
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:05,542
Brief guys. Send photos to
all gossips throughout Talvik.

490
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:10,417
He stops to pee, I
Knowing the color and smell of urine.

491
01:05:11,667 --> 01:05:14,583
- Odor and color.
- And make ready their weapons.

492
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:18,250
Now we shoot anything other than gulls,
for once.

493
01:05:23,417 --> 01:05:26,000
Do you really
think this is going to work?

494
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:31,000
I mean,
say we actually manage to wake these russians back to life .

495
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:34,000
Whats stopping them from killing us?

496
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:40,000
I dont know whats gonna happen.
But judging based on him -

497
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:44,083
- he treats you like you're his master,
so hopefully they'll do the same.

498
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,208
Hopefully.

499
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,333
look I dont know man
this is some unprecedented unheard of -

500
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,542
- Mysterious voodoo zombie shit man
I've never seen this before.

501
01:05:55,708 --> 01:06:01,042
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not in any of them.

502
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:05,000
You have created a whole new genre here man.

503
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:09,500
look i mean if we're gonna go up against a battalion of
Nazi zombies -

504
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:13,500
-we could do a whole lot worse than
teaming up with a battlion of russian zombies.

505
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:20,000
He has to die you know?. Herzog.

506
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:23,792
For what he did.
We have to kill him.

507
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:29,333
I have to kill him.
For Hanna.

508
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:35,833
- this it is.
- Yeah.

509
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:40,375
this is definitely it.

510
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:46,042
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

511
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:50,875
So they've got to be buried in this frozen ground.
.

512
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,125
how we do this?

513
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,042
we do it just like you did -

514
01:06:58,208 --> 01:06:59,958
- with him.

515
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:02,792
I put my hand on his head.

516
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:06,542
Okay. Right.

517
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:11,083
we cant dig up everyone it will take weeks.

518
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:15,500
You have to wake them up,
one way or another.

519
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:42,167
Lord.

520
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:50,042
f**k yeah!

521
01:10:24,292 --> 01:10:26,542
He was first seen here.

522
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,958
In Øksfjord.

523
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:35,792
And next time here.
Museum at lsnestoften.

524
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:40,375
So it looks as if
he's heading south. Perhaps there.

525
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:44,333
We have a problem.

526
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:49,167
A gang dressed as Germans
going bananas out there?

527
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:52,375
Bananas?
They killed loads of different people.

528
01:10:52,542 --> 01:10:57,333
We have not had a murder since 74,
and suddenly there Ragnarok.

529
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:03,083
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shoot first, ask later!

530
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:51,833
There is no one here.
We have showed them the door.

531
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,208
They are gone.

532
01:11:56,375 --> 01:11:59,708
Since you can not complete the mission, -

533
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:04,375
- You can just turn
and go back to your snow cave.

534
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:36,292
Some have grown a bit since last time.
Been a little bigger.

535
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:43,458
I also taught a couple of buddies
the dance.

536
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:32,417
Is it not a bit sour
when you thought someone was dead -

537
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:35,458
- Coming back to kill you?

538
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:04,875
Let's kill them.

539
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:06,458
Troops!

540
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,250
Attack!

541
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,833
Let's kill them all!

542
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:32,958
What the hell is going on here?
Is the carnival in town?

543
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:28,667
they have tanks?

544
01:16:38,333 --> 01:16:40,417
- Damn!
- Run!

545
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:42,167
Help!

546
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,542
Daniel! tank.

547
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:27,375
- Should not we help them?
- Help who?

548
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:32,542
Those with blemishes in german uniform
or those with blemishes in Russian?

549
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,208
<i>okay </i>

550
01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:19,000
Good boy.

551
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:35,125
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!
- What the hell's going on?

552
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:38,542
Do as hell.
Looks like a video game.

553
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:41,167
look Martin Hykkerud!

554
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:44,583
- Yes!
- Should we take him?

555
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:48,083
No, no.
Wait until it calms down.

556
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:51,750
this is tactical policing.

557
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:20,417
Zombie Squad. It's about time!

558
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:22,958
- thats a long story.
- There was a tank.

559
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:25,458
And guy took my jacket.

560
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:30,625
- looks like you found Stavarin and his men i see.
- Yeah but there's still more them than us .

561
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:33,625
i guess it's time we even out the odds a bit huh.

562
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:20,250
guys! We're losing!

563
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:23,292
look!

564
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,042
shit!

565
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:39,083
No, no, no

566
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,333
No!

567
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:51,583
Wait!

568
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:54,583
We have to kill him!

569
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:57,458
They're all bound to him like the russians are to you
.

570
01:21:57,625 --> 01:22:00,708
If he dies, the others will too .

571
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:06,458
lets finish this.

572
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,458
<i>Untermensch. </i>

573
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:29,833
guys come on.
No seat belts?

574
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,208
You just asking for it.

575
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,958
fuckin hell how many more of these are there?

576
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:12,917
Is this it?

577
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:17,542
Monica, is this how it's gonna end?

578
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:19,417
No, no.

579
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:22,750
- we're gonna die now?
- No.

580
01:24:25,458 --> 01:24:27,250
Fuck it.

581
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:30,958
fuck it i'm just gonna say it.
-what?

582
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:34,083
I, -

583
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:37,042
- Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, is

584
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,708
No!

585
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:43,625
- Blake!
- Glenn?

586
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,292
Monica ..

587
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:55,917
Why did not you just
stay on the mountain?

588
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:05,542
You got's what you should have.
You got the gold.

589
01:28:09,667 --> 01:28:11,917
But it was not enough.

590
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:17,833
You were greedy.

591
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,083
wanted more.

592
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,167
Blake

593
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:28,500
- Monica
- watch out!

594
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:33,292
- Monica!
- Blake!

595
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,625
Blake! No!

596
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:53,458
That's why you lost.

597
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:57,000
Because you were greedy.

598
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:05,500
You know you lost the war?

599
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:09,917
Lost everything.

600
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:14,542
ridiculed.

601
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:17,042
Pathetic.

602
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:19,917
And you know what?

603
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:23,583
You lose again.

604
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,375
No!

605
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:49,292
My God!

606
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:54,292
He did it!

607
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:59,583
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked. I knew it.

608
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:03,417
Herzog is dead.

609
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:05,833
He is dead. Yes!

610
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,083
that was close.

611
01:30:35,917 --> 01:30:39,333
You did it!
You killed Herzog?

612
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:43,750
i cant believe that that actually worked.

613
01:30:43,917 --> 01:30:46,583
Of course it did.

614
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,542
you doubted the Zombie Squad?

615
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:53,708
Kenneth Glenn, is he ...?

616
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:58,208
He didnt make it.

617
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:13,375
It's been a true honor
killing zombies with you guys.

618
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:17,125
you too martin.

619
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,958
What is it? Okay.

620
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:28,833
- You can say it.
- go for it.

621
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:34,875
May the force be with you.

622
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:42,375
Really? That one?
Of all the ...? You chose that one?

623
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:46,667
theres like a million to choose from,
why would you choose that one?

624
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:14,125
- Where the hell are they?
- I know as hell.

625
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:18,042
Hell too! Bjarne!

626
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,250
Are you in a coma?

627
01:32:21,417 --> 01:32:23,792
Go and find them, dammit!

628
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:32,875
I would resolve this matter.
Do not end with a hundred new corpses.

629
01:32:33,042 --> 01:32:38,083
Where do we fit it all?
The garage and the freezer is packed.

630
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:41,500
I do not know! I do not know.

631
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:52,625
The gulls again. They've not
eaten so well since the war.

632
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:58,250
We should have
the damn machine.

633
01:32:58,417 --> 01:33:01,667
Whoever translates
seagull language to human language.

634
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:05,500
Then we would fuck me
Jack the matter as an egg.

635
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:08,542
As an egg.

636
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:03,875
(groan)
