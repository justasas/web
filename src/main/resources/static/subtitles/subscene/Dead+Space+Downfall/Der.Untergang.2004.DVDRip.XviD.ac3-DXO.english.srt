1
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:51,783
I have the feeling that
I should be angry with this child,

2
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:55,740
with this childish young thing,
or I shouldn't forgive her

3
00:00:56,185 --> 00:01:00,065
for not realizing the horrors,
the monster, before it was too late,

4
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:03,976
for not realizing
what she was getting into.

5
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:07,577
How could I have agreed to it
so impulsively?

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,177
I was not an enthusiastic Nazi.

7
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:14,982
When I came to Berlin,
I could have said "No,

8
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:19,022
I won't take part. I don't want to be
sent to the Führer's headquarters. "

9
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:22,823
But I didn't say no.
Curiosity got the better of me.

10
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,259
And I simply never thought

11
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:32,418
that fate would take me somewhere
I'd never really wanted to be.

12
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:38,066
And yet, it's very hard
to forgive myself for doing it.

13
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:46,427
The ladies are here.

14
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:50,822
Military District II has confirmed.
- You may pass.

15
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,307
FÜHRER'S HEADQUARTERS "WOLFSSCHANZE"

16
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,060
RASTENBURG, EAST PRUSSIA, NOV. 1942

17
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,218
Please take a seat, ladies.

18
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,860
I must ask you to wait a few minutes.

19
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,983
The Führer is feeding his dog.
He will be with you shortly.

20
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,107
Tell me... How do we...
How does one greet the Führer?

21
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:47,864
The Führer will speak to you first,
and you just say, "Heil, my Führer. "

22
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,790
What about the Nazi salute?

23
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:54,499
That won't be necessary. The Führer
isn't recruiting you as soldiers,

24
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:57,340
he's looking for a secretary.

25
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:58,946
Behave normally.

26
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:03,180
Just be natural. I'll ask him
if he has time for you now.

27
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:10,583
My Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

28
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:33,625
I'd like to thank you for coming
in the middle of the night, ladies.

29
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:39,143
But in war, we aren't always
masters of our own time.

30
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:44,629
May I ask your name?
- Margarethe Lorenz. Heil, my Führer.

31
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:48,589
Where are you from?
- Fulda. Heil, my Führer. - And you?

32
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:50,069
Ursula Puttkammer.

33
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:54,905
Heil, my Führer. - Leave that out,
child. Tell me where you're from.

34
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:57,504
Frankfurt on the Main, my Führ...

35
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:01,743
I'm Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

36
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:04,629
To be precise, I come from Pankow.

37
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:08,545
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Swabia.

38
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:10,630
And you?

39
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:13,543
Traudl Humps. I come from Munich.

40
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:16,704
A Munich girl.

41
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:25,789
So, Fräulein Humps...

42
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:28,545
shall we start?

43
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,671
Blondi won't hurt you.

44
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:43,232
She has a very sharp mind.

45
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:46,430
In fact, she's more clever
than most people are.

46
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:53,473
Just make yourself comfortable.

47
00:04:54,157 --> 00:04:58,116
Don't be nervous. I make
so many mistakes when I dictate...

48
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:01,276
You'll never make as many as I do.

49
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,468
You're quite young.

50
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:14,067
How old are you?

51
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:16,190
22, my Führer.

52
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:22,795
My national comrades...

53
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,756
German men and women...

54
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:27,917
members of the Party...

55
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,593
It is, I believe, a rare thing

56
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,233
that a man can stand before his old
supporters after 20 years in office,

57
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,836
and that during those 20 years

58
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,634
he did not have to modify

59
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,799
his policies whatsoever.

60
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,558
I suggest...
that we try it again.

61
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,319
I made it! He gave me a job!

62
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,474
Berlin, 20 April, 1945
Adolf Hitler's 56th birthday

63
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,798
21/2 years later

64
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:42,197
Duck!

65
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:49,154
Keep moving! Get off the street!

66
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,198
Duck!

67
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:06,233
That's artillery.

68
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:09,993
Are you crazy?
How could they be firing artillery?

69
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:14,195
Frau Junge, you're right!
Those aren't bombs, it's artillery!

70
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,841
It's the Russians.
- What a fine birthday present!

71
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:25,764
What's going on, Burgdorf?
Where's that gunfire coming from?

72
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:28,434
Happy birthday, my Führer.

73
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:31,478
Central Berlin is being shelled,

74
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:34,359
from the Brandenburg Gate
to the Reichstag,

75
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:37,239
up to Friedrichstrasse Station.
- Where from?

76
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:41,837
No reports yet. Koller's on the line.
- Give him to me.

77
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:46,433
Koller, do you realize
Berlin is under artillery fire?

78
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:48,318
No.
- Don't tell me

79
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:50,084
you can't hearthe gunfire!

80
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,323
No, I'm at Werder Game Park.
- Berlin's in uproar!

81
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,564
The Russians have taken
a rail bridge on the Oder.

82
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:59,600
They've got no railway batteries
near the Oder.

83
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,559
That's not long-range gunfire.

84
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:05,156
The flak command post
in the Zoo-bunker

85
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:07,722
claims the guns have a caliber

86
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,758
of just 10 to 12 cm.

87
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:12,197
The Russian battery
is now in Marzahn.

88
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:14,922
That's only 12 kilometers
from the city center!

89
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:17,284
Are the Russians that close?

90
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:20,446
The entire air force command
should be hanged!

91
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:23,522
Outrageous!

92
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:24,877
Outrageous!

93
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:28,046
The Russians are just 12 kilometers
from the city center,

94
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,604
and nobody told me! I had to ask!

95
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:33,955
My Führer, perhaps

96
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:36,876
it's long-range gunfire.
You mentioned a railway battery...

97
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,888
Nonsense!

98
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:48,402
Himmler is such a pompous clown!
- Big shots!

99
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:53,319
Big shots everywhere! It makes me
sick just looking at them!

100
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,678
The Führer is putting "Clausewitz"
into operation today.

101
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,804
Berlin as a front-line city...
He won't be able to hold the city.

102
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:04,963
If the Führer stays, he'll take
the whole Reich down with him.

103
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:09,448
We have to talk him out of it.
Speak to Hewel...

104
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:14,162
He's the only diplomat
who can still influence him.

105
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,201
Believe me, it's no use.

106
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,080
Then talk to your sister-in-law.

107
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,127
Why not? You're married
to Eva Braun's sister,

108
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,528
so you're "related" to the Führer.
We have to try everything.

109
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,200
Berlin is practically
surrounded by the Russians.

110
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,925
You're young.
You'll be a father soon.

111
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,282
Do you want to die in Berlin?
- Certainly not.

112
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,481
Gentlemen, the Führer!

113
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:57,610
Everything out, and quick!
We're leaving in two hours.

114
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:05,811
What's going on?
- We're packing!

115
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:10,609
Leaving... Haven't you heard?
"Clausewitz" is in effect.

116
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:14,362
All government departments and
Wehrmacht offices are leaving Berlin.

117
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:17,884
Who's going to feed
the civilians and soldiers?

118
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:20,563
Don't ask me, Professor.

119
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:22,890
This is insane!

120
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,286
Ah, Professor!

121
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:46,013
I won't allow my staff
to be evacuated! - Is that so?

122
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:48,922
The food supply to Berlin
will collapse!

123
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:52,252
A good soldier always finds
something to eat! - Sure!

124
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:56,846
And when fighting begins, who
will he take food from? Civilians!

125
00:10:57,294 --> 00:11:00,206
I cannot permit it!
- The Führer's orders!

126
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:05,013
As the department head,
I answer to the SS and to Himmler!

127
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:09,528
But as a doctor I belong to the
Wehrmacht, and we are still here!

128
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,567
Please bear that in mind!

129
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:21,208
The professor can stay in Berlin!
Give him an authorized permit!

130
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:25,775
Move out!

131
00:11:38,576 --> 00:11:41,613
Everything for Germany. Heil, my Führer!

132
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:45,849
My Führer, I... Heil, my Führer!

133
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:49,010
They can hardly wait to get away.

134
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:51,527
I hate those two-faced sods who say

135
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,811
"Sieg Heil", but behind their
backs say, "Kiss my a... aunt. "

136
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:00,206
My Führer...

137
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:04,254
I beg you to leave Berlin.
It's not too late.

138
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:05,892
Too late?

139
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:08,647
Come here, Hewel.

140
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:13,770
Hewel, you also feel we should
get in touch with the Allies...

141
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:15,888
and use politics.

142
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:20,370
Yes, indeed. We should use politics.

143
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:24,606
Politics? No more politics!

144
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:27,414
I'm sick of politics!

145
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,610
When I'm dead, you'll have

146
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,936
enough politics to deal with!
- My Führer...

147
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:36,416
It's okay, my dear Himmler.

148
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,727
My loyal Heinrich.

149
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,935
It's okay... Go now.

150
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,330
Between us, I'd say he's had it.
- Yeah?

151
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,171
What do you expect from a teetotal,
non-smoking vegetarian?

152
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:10,337
Be serious.

153
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:13,500
I'll have to
to take it into my own hands.

154
00:13:13,941 --> 00:13:16,375
Berlin will fall
in the next few days.

155
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:20,700
Once the Führer is dead,
who will the Allies negotiate with?

156
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,250
What makes you so sure
they'll negotiate?

157
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:28,012
They need the Nazi state and my SS
to keep order after the war.

158
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:32,216
Give me an hour with Eisenhower, and
he'll agree. We're already in touch.

159
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:38,658
Be careful, that's treason.
- Fegelein, I have other worries.

160
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:44,176
Should I give Eisenhower
the Nazi salute or shake his hand?

161
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:51,496
Well, well...

162
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,141
The later it gets,
the nicer the guests.

163
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,416
Gentlemen, are you leaving already?

164
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:01,421
I wanted to talk to you.

165
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:07,093
The Führer's orders to destroy all
public... - I really must go.

166
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:10,183
Drop in to visit me
at Hohenlychen sometime.

167
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:17,822
My staff and I are heading north
to support the battle for Berlin.

168
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:28,013
So, Speer...

169
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:31,662
the bombing raids on our cities
have a positive side too.

170
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:36,975
It's much easier to remove the debris
than to tear everything down.

171
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:42,259
Once we win the war, reconstruction
will be completed very quickly.

172
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:48,977
How many thousands of hours have we
spent on these magnificent models?

173
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,702
You're a true genius, Speer.

174
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:55,582
Yes, you are.

175
00:14:56,026 --> 00:14:59,905
Only you and I realize
that a Third Reich isn't possible

176
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:03,061
if it only consists of
department stores and factories,

177
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:07,181
skyscrapers and hotels.
This Third Reich

178
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:10,094
will be a treasure house
of art and culture

179
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:14,859
that will survive the millennia...
We see before us

180
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:18,583
the ancient cities, the acropolis,

181
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:22,337
we see medieval cities
with their cathedrals, and we know

182
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:25,904
that people need something
like this, a center.

183
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,057
Yes, Speer...

184
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:35,499
That was my vision...

185
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:39,459
And it still is.

186
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:42,777
My Führer...

187
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:46,300
If you want to realize these plans,
you should leave Berlin.

188
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:56,827
Say something, Eva.
- He's the Führer.

189
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,623
He knows what's right.

190
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,105
Please leave Berlin.

191
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,347
The Russians have nearly cut us off.

192
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:05,581
I can't do that, child.

193
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,748
I'd feel like a lama

194
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:11,783
spinning an empty prayer-wheel.

195
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:16,303
I must force an outcome in Berlin,
or face my downfall.

196
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,309
Speer...

197
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,308
What do you say?

198
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,461
You must be on stage
when the curtain falls.

199
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:46,706
Reload!

200
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:57,787
Leave me alone!

201
00:16:59,232 --> 00:17:04,784
How old are you? 12? And you? 14?
And you? Do you want to play war?

202
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,826
Go home, play another game!
- Who are you?

203
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:10,342
What do you want?
- My son... alive.

204
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:12,948
You should be proud of him.

205
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:16,748
He destroyed two tanks. Today.
The Führer is giving him a medal.

206
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:20,985
You're young.
On which front did you fight?

207
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,465
I haven't had the honor yet.

208
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:28,429
You're lucky you haven't seen
a battle yet. Send the children home.

209
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:31,628
We will fight to the very last man.

210
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:33,347
What are you defending?

211
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:35,351
This is nothing but a trap.

212
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:39,309
The Russians will attack from
both sides, so there's no escape.

213
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,073
We'll shoot back at them!

214
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:44,028
With what?
- We're using flak as artillery.

215
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:47,268
The Russians are coming,
several armies with tanks

216
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:49,784
and heavy artillery.
Do you really believe

217
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,032
you can hold off their assault
for even five minutes?

218
00:17:53,474 --> 00:17:55,032
We made our pledge to the Führer.

219
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:59,392
Don't you understand?
We've lost the war! It's over!

220
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,069
Coward!

221
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:07,908
Get outta here! Now!

222
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:13,186
When the Russians come and
you're still here, you'll all die!

223
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:19,188
I may be repeating myself,
but the 9th Army must retreat.

224
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:21,752
Otherwise, it will be wiped out.

225
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:27,634
The 9th Army will not retreat!
Tell Busse to fight where he stands.

226
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,146
In that case, the 9th Army is lost.

227
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:36,353
We will drive back the Soviet units
in the north and east

228
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:40,756
with a relentless
and almighty assault.

229
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,266
With which units?

230
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:47,872
Steiner's division will attack from
the north and unite with the 9th.

231
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,713
The 9th Army is unable to move north.

232
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:54,910
The enemy outnumbers us 10 to 1.

233
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:58,554
Have Wenck support them
with the 12th Army.

234
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,313
But the 12th Army
is marching west, to the Elbe.

235
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,749
Then tell them to turn around!

236
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:07,986
That would expose the Western front.
- Are you questioning my orders?

237
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:13,273
I believe I've made myself
perfectly clear!

238
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,837
The western Allies will realize that
only we can hold off the Bolsheviks.

239
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:20,712
We're the last bulwark
against the Asian hordes.

240
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:24,947
If we hold Berlin for a few more days
we'll make a deal with the Americans.

241
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,758
Ah, Mohnke...

242
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,919
you're here.
- My Führer.

243
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,397
I put "Clausewitz" into effect today.
Berlin is now a front-line city.

244
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,277
You're in charge of defending
the government district.

245
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,913
If there's a battle in Berlin,
we'll fight to the last man.

246
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,113
But there are over
3 million civilians.

247
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:07,119
They have to be evacuated.

248
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,230
I appreciate your concern, Mohnke.

249
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:15,076
But we have to be cold-blooded.

250
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:19,036
We can't worry about
these so-called civilians now!

251
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:23,989
With all due respect, what will
become of the women and children,

252
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:26,637
the thousands of wounded,
and the elderly?

253
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:31,518
In a war like this
there are no civilians.

254
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,840
The Führer has lost
all sense of reality.

255
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,842
He moves divisions
that only exist on his map.

256
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:40,796
Steiner's scattered unit
can hardly defend itself,

257
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,120
and now he wants Steiner to attack.
It's insane! - Tell him yourself.

258
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:48,272
He wouldn't listen. You know that.
- Something has to be done.

259
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,920
Are you crazy? He'd kick us out like
Rundstedt and Guderian. - So what?

260
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:57,759
We're soldiers! We pledged
our allegiance to the Führer!

261
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:00,201
Should that prevent us from thinking?

262
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:04,192
Look who's talking! An opportunist!
A ruthless careerist!

263
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:05,200
Pardon?

264
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:32,325
Where were you?
- None of your damned business!

265
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:44,759
My Führer, Berlin Hitler Youth's
most successful tank hunters.

266
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:55,044
I'm proud of you all.

267
00:21:57,886 --> 00:21:59,638
My Führer, this boy alone

268
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,042
destroyed two tanks with a bazooka.

269
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:04,078
His name is Peter Kranz.

270
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:06,284
So your name is Peter.

271
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:11,883
I wish my generals had your courage.

272
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:22,481
Fine, fine.

273
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:31,238
History will take note of you.

274
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:36,759
And when Germania rises up
from these ruins,

275
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:38,641
you'll be the heroes.

276
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:42,443
Heil to you!

277
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,119
I don't know about you,

278
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,959
but this gives me the creeps.
I prefer bombing raids.

279
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,048
What will happen to us?

280
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,004
Yesterday, he told me it was alright
if I left.

281
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,162
Everyone's deserting him.
We can't just get up and leave.

282
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,726
I can't either.

283
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,200
I've no idea where I should go.

284
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:41,245
My parents and friends back home
warned me. They told me

285
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:43,124
not to get involved with the Nazis.

286
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:47,201
Should I go back and say,
"I'm home. I made a mistake.

287
00:23:47,651 --> 00:23:49,881
When things got bad
I realized my mistake. "

288
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,128
Life will go on, somehow.

289
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:03,411
What do you think, Colonel?

290
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:05,560
We should go.

291
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:08,568
Where to?

292
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,922
I don't know.
Some place where we're needed.

293
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,530
Come upstairs, everyone!
We're going to have a party!

294
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:29,452
Come on!

295
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,691
Come on, kids!

296
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,849
I want us to have some fun today.

297
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,809
No matter where the enemy goes

298
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:53,210
he has to find nothing but wasteland.

299
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:57,293
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

300
00:24:58,695 --> 00:25:00,413
No electricity, no gas,
no clean water,

301
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:02,208
no coal, no transportation.

302
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:07,092
By destroying all our railways,
canals, docks, ships and locomotives,

303
00:25:07,535 --> 00:25:09,605
we would hurl Germany
back to the Middle Ages.

304
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:13,172
You'd be robbing our people
of every chance to survive.

305
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:17,086
If the war is lost, it's immaterial
if the people perish too.

306
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:20,055
It is not necessary

307
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:24,569
to consider the German people's
primitive survival needs.

308
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:27,689
On the contrary, it is better
to destroy those things ourselves.

309
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:31,765
They have proved themselves
too weak and it is a law of nature

310
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:34,491
that they will be exterminated.

311
00:25:35,056 --> 00:25:37,810
They are your people.
You are the Führer.

312
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:41,374
The only ones who
will survive the battle

313
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:45,571
are the inferior ones.
Our best people have fallen already.

314
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:54,128
Here you go.
Oh, come on, you're supposed to dance.

315
00:25:58,378 --> 00:26:00,334
With pleasure.

316
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,698
Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.

317
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:29,489
What's the matter?

318
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:36,616
Convince him that
we have to leave Berlin, Eva!

319
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,655
Or come with me.

320
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,656
You're going to die.

321
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:13,415
Put on the music!

322
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:15,374
I want to dance!

323
00:27:15,821 --> 00:27:17,300
Dance!

324
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:23,774
Anything in particular?
- Swing.

325
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:51,693
Traudl...

326
00:27:57,303 --> 00:27:58,816
It's all so unreal...

327
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:01,732
...like a dream

328
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:05,813
where you want to wake up,
but you can't.

329
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:09,176
It keeps going on and on...

330
00:28:11,784 --> 00:28:15,015
Gerda, I feel sick...

331
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:52,138
Come on! Come on!

332
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:11,584
I haven't moved my command...

333
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:16,465
I haven't moved my command post!

334
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:19,818
...to the west...?

335
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:23,259
I'm 1000 meters from the enemy!
- General!

336
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,581
Hello? Hello!

337
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:43,897
The report, General?

338
00:29:44,788 --> 00:29:48,099
I'm to be shot.
- What? What for?

339
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:50,938
They claim that I moved
my command post

340
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,506
to the west, away from the enemy.
- Not a bad idea.

341
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,979
Come with me.

342
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,305
Schenck.
- Mohnke.

343
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,540
I'm at the chancellery bunker
defending the government district.

344
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,949
I need your help. - That's difficult,
everyone's been evacuated.

345
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,779
Everyone's gone
except me and my adjutant.

346
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,107
You're a doctor?
- Yes. Internist.

347
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:31,462
Find a vehicle and bring us

348
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:33,902
all the morphine, penicillin

349
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,421
and first-aid supplies you can find!

350
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:40,707
I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you, and hurry.

351
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:29,946
I have to see the Führer.

352
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:32,863
What for?

353
00:31:33,314 --> 00:31:34,542
I'm to be shot.

354
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:39,423
Wait here.

355
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:42,586
Your guns, please.

356
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:49,625
Not here.

357
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,354
Guard post 2.

358
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:57,594
Roger.

359
00:31:59,155 --> 00:31:59,871
General...

360
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:03,512
Not you.

361
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,344
Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

362
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:29,185
What's going on?
Why am I to be shot?

363
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:34,108
You know the Führer has forbidden
any westward retreat.

364
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:39,073
Officers who disobey are to be
arrested and shot on the spot.

365
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:42,827
What do you mean? My units
have been in fierce battle for days!

366
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:46,075
My command post is just one kilometer
from the front line.

367
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:48,833
Go on.

368
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:54,636
You see this, don't you?
Don't use that tone with me!

369
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:57,276
Now do what you have to do!

370
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:03,391
I think you should explain it
to the Führer yourself. Come along.

371
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,388
I can't let you through. - I'm here
on orders from Commander Mohnke.

372
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,876
We need first-aid material
from the military hospital.

373
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,355
It's empty. They all left.

374
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,673
And the wounded?
- How should I know?

375
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,235
I'll have a look.
- Colonel! - Stay here!

376
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,639
Careful you don't get killed.
There are Russians everywhere.

377
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,078
See that?
It's the end of the Reich.

378
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,078
That's Russki territory!

379
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,952
May I?

380
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:03,679
He's so damn stubborn.

381
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:06,760
Why didn't he let me do it?

382
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:08,036
I should be with my troops.
Are you sure the Führer needs me?

383
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:11,961
Drink up! The Führer's orders!

384
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:17,478
You really impressed the Führer.
- You don't think Steiner'll attack?

385
00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:21,276
I doubt that Steiner's units
are able to attack,

386
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:24,398
but why am I telling you this?
You know better than I do.

387
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:28,201
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin will be lost.

388
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:39,394
Congratulations, your report
really impressed the Führer.

389
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:42,520
He has appointed you
commander of Berlin's defense.

390
00:35:44,486 --> 00:35:49,162
I'd rather have been shot
than have this honor...

391
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:14,843
Tank alarm!

392
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:19,435
Stay calm.
They're too far away to do anything.

393
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:02,559
Out of the way please, ladies.

394
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,127
Is that German artillery out there?
- I'm afraid not.

395
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,130
But Steiner's attack
should be underway by now!

396
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,445
You have to leave.
There isn't much time.

397
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,484
But the Führer believes
Steiner's attack

398
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,643
will make good of the situation.

399
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,284
I heard him say

400
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,608
that Steiner's assault
will turn things around.

401
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:31,680
All the Führer's advisors
know that's absurd!

402
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:36,966
I'd not be surprised if he thinks
so too. - Why would he deceive us?

403
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,242
What does he have to lose?

404
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:42,130
I don't believe a word of it!

405
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:45,449
The enemy has broken through
along a wide front.

406
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:49,168
They've taken Zossen to the south
and are advancing to Stahnsdorf.

407
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:53,048
They're on the northern outskirts
between Frohnau and Pankow.

408
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:56,529
They've reached Lichtenberg,
Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst to the east.

409
00:37:58,852 --> 00:38:02,481
Steiner's assault will
bring it under control.

410
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:07,085
My Führer...

411
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:09,967
Steiner...

412
00:38:12,093 --> 00:38:14,323
Steiner couldn't mobilize
enough men.

413
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:17,287
He wasn't able
to carry out his assault.

414
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:38,406
These men will stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

415
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:53,767
That was an order!

416
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:58,333
Steiner's assault was an order!
Who do you think you are

417
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:02,529
to dare disobey an order that I give?

418
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:06,928
So this is what it has come to!

419
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,493
The military has been lying to me.

420
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:12,655
Everybody has been lying to me.
Even the SS!

421
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:18,090
Our generals are just a bunch
of contemptible, disloyal cowards.

422
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:20,572
I can't permit you
to insult the soldiers...

423
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:23,814
They are cowards,
traitors and failures!

424
00:39:24,256 --> 00:39:26,053
My Führer, this is outrageous!

425
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:29,533
Our generals are the scum
of the German people!

426
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:32,487
Not a shred of honor!

427
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:37,495
They call themselves generals!
Years at military academy

428
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:40,895
just to learn how to hold
a knife and fork!

429
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,929
For years, the military

430
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:45,254
has hindered my plans!

431
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:47,494
They've put every kind of obstacle

432
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:50,207
in my way!

433
00:39:50,657 --> 00:39:53,570
What I should have done

434
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:58,933
is liquidate all the high-ranking
officers, as Stalin did!

435
00:40:03,218 --> 00:40:05,686
I never attended an academy,

436
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:12,766
and yet I have conquered Europe
all by myself!

437
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:17,927
Traitors!

438
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:22,975
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the very beginning!

439
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:26,453
What a monstrous betrayal

440
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:31,097
of the German people.
But all those traitors will pay.

441
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:34,373
They'll pay with their own blood.

442
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,539
They shall drown in their own blood!

443
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,133
Gerda, please calm yourself.

444
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,294
My orders have fallen on deaf ears.

445
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,578
Under these circumstances,
I am no longer able to lead...

446
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:00,137
It's over.

447
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:07,410
The war is lost.

448
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:16,893
But, gentlemen, if you believe
I am going to leave Berlin,

449
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:21,858
you are seriously mistaken.
I'd rather blow my brains out.

450
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,452
Do whatever you like.

451
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:51,853
The Führer didn't really mean
he'd shoot himself...

452
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:55,739
Frau Junge
and Frau Christian...

453
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:01,772
Get changed. A plane is leaving
in an hour. It will take you south.

454
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,457
Everything is lost...

455
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:08,860
Hopelessly lost.

456
00:42:12,024 --> 00:42:15,733
You know I'll stay with you.
I won't let you send me away.

457
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,535
I'm staying too!

458
00:42:52,826 --> 00:42:54,179
What now?

459
00:42:54,946 --> 00:42:56,584
It's time to end this spectacle.

460
00:42:57,026 --> 00:43:00,736
What? You want to give up?
That's unthinkable.

461
00:43:02,027 --> 00:43:03,426
The Führer said we won't surrender.

462
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:06,427
We won't repeat November 1918.
Never!

463
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:08,903
You heard him. He'll no longer lead us.

464
00:43:09,347 --> 00:43:14,057
He said, "Do whatever you want. "
- The Führer is the Führer!

465
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:16,745
He'll pull himself together.

466
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:18,815
Great.

467
00:43:19,267 --> 00:43:21,304
And what happens then?

468
00:43:23,308 --> 00:43:26,141
We can never surrender.
The Führer would never approve.

469
00:43:26,588 --> 00:43:29,466
We swore to obey his will.
- Nothing but empty phrases!

470
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:32,741
We have to do something
before it's too late.

471
00:43:33,188 --> 00:43:35,224
You want to save your own skin.
- Stop it!

472
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:45,704
Damn it!

473
00:43:50,389 --> 00:43:55,782
We'll never get out alive.
It's all over. - Just wait.

474
00:43:56,229 --> 00:43:59,858
But the Führer is uncertain.
What if he kills himself?

475
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:04,026
Günsche said there's a tunnel
under the Russian lines to the Yanks.

476
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,863
Why did you say you'd stay with him?

477
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,108
I don't know... honestly.

478
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:17,023
They've stopped. Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

479
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:57,986
Traudl...

480
00:44:58,672 --> 00:45:00,310
Look...

481
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:24,112
Hey girls, I need a cigarette.

482
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:43,630
Let's go back down again.

483
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,145
Where did they come from?
- New Volkssturm recruits!

484
00:46:15,596 --> 00:46:16,870
Assigned this afternoon!

485
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,592
Tell them to get out
of the line of fire!

486
00:46:22,956 --> 00:46:27,825
These recruits
are under Dr. Goebbels' command!

487
00:46:30,277 --> 00:46:34,509
I want them outta there,
right away!

488
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:36,675
I'll answer for it.

489
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,636
I'm not sure it's the right way.

490
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:50,871
Oh, splendid.

491
00:46:51,918 --> 00:46:53,033
Stop! Lights out!

492
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:56,189
Stop. Don't move.

493
00:46:57,038 --> 00:46:59,791
Don't move.
- Lucky! Germans.

494
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:06,638
Help! They want to kill us!

495
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,547
What's going on here?
- They're MPs.

496
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:11,717
I don't believe it!

497
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,032
Stop it! Let those men go!

498
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:27,507
What's going on here?
- It's none of your business!

499
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:30,799
We found these deserters
in their homes.

500
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,992
They'll be shot, like every traitor.

501
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,989
They're old men, civilians.
You can't do that!

502
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,509
No?

503
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,351
Who's going to stop me? You?

504
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,989
That's enough.

505
00:48:01,561 --> 00:48:02,789
Move out!

506
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:43,675
Here's a doctor.

507
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,595
Can you operate?

508
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:54,635
Not really.

509
00:49:57,047 --> 00:49:59,800
Tell Ilse that the children
can't take too many toys.

510
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,236
One toy per child.

511
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:06,203
And no unnecessary nightclothes.
- Minister Goebbels...

512
00:50:06,647 --> 00:50:10,560
My wife and children are coming.
Please take care of them.

513
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:14,803
Thank you.
Brigadeführer, what can I do for you?

514
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:18,001
The Russians are mowing down
your Volkssturm recruits.

515
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:21,002
They lack experience
and suitable weapons.

516
00:50:21,448 --> 00:50:26,761
That is compensated for by their
fervent belief in the final victory.

517
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,005
If you can't arm these men,

518
00:50:29,448 --> 00:50:32,087
they can't fight.
They are dying in vain.

519
00:50:33,808 --> 00:50:35,287
I feel no sympathy.

520
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:40,647
I repeat, I feel no sympathy!

521
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:43,045
The German people chose their fate.

522
00:50:43,689 --> 00:50:46,840
That may surprise some people.
Don't fool yourself.

523
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:49,484
We didn't force the German people.

524
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:54,400
They gave us the mandate. And now
their little throats are being cut.

525
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:07,840
Yes?

526
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,049
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

527
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:14,764
Hermann!
- Don't be stupid.

528
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,609
It's a matter of life and death.

529
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,405
How can you say such a thing?
Where are you?

530
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:22,445
I've decided not to die in Berlin.

531
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:25,360
Hermann, does my sister know
where you are?

532
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:28,086
I have to call you back.

533
00:51:29,371 --> 00:51:32,408
Hi there, kids.
Your room's on the right.

534
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:36,406
Wait for me.

535
00:51:36,851 --> 00:51:40,321
Hello, Frau Goebbels.
- Nice to see you, Frau Junge.

536
00:51:51,892 --> 00:51:54,326
Come on now, get in line!

537
00:51:54,772 --> 00:51:57,002
Come here, Helga. Get in line.

538
00:51:58,012 --> 00:51:59,365
We'll put on our best clothes,

539
00:52:00,532 --> 00:52:02,251
and then you can say hello
to Uncle Hitler.

540
00:52:02,693 --> 00:52:05,207
Yes! Yes! Yes!

541
00:52:06,093 --> 00:52:07,287
Remember your song?

542
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:09,325
Yes.

543
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:13,652
No land is more beautiful...

544
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:19,486
...far and wide
than the land we call our own...

545
00:52:46,015 --> 00:52:50,133
If you want to be certain,
shoot the gun into your mouth...

546
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,851
Your skull will explode.

547
00:52:54,335 --> 00:52:57,566
You don't notice a thing.
You die immediately.

548
00:52:58,015 --> 00:53:00,893
I want to look nice when I'm dead.
I'll take poison.

549
00:53:01,335 --> 00:53:04,247
If I'm going to die heroically
I don't want to feel any pain.

550
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:06,334
That's a sure-fire way.

551
00:53:06,776 --> 00:53:11,372
It paralyzes the nerves
and the respiratory system.

552
00:53:11,816 --> 00:53:13,807
You die within seconds.

553
00:53:15,296 --> 00:53:16,615
Could I have one, too?

554
00:53:17,056 --> 00:53:18,125
Me, too.

555
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:27,775
Thank goodness
Himmler left me well supplied.

556
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:46,531
Thank you.

557
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:52,329
I'm so sorry I can't give you
a better present.

558
00:54:00,418 --> 00:54:02,409
Berlin, 23 April,

559
00:54:03,098 --> 00:54:04,656
1945.

560
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:12,648
My dearest sister, I'm so sorry
I have to write you this.

561
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:17,695
But there's nothing we can do.
At any minute, it could all be over.

562
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:19,094
You should know

563
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:22,815
that Hermann isn't here.
But I truly believe

564
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,136
you'll see him again.

565
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:28,976
I'm sure he'll continue
the fight in Bavaria

566
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,376
for a certain time. The Führer

567
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,096
has lost all belief
in a favorable outcome.

568
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,849
My beloved son, I don't know
if this letter will reach you.

569
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,052
Perhaps there is some human soul

570
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,173
who will pass on
my final words to you.

571
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,973
I've stayed with Papa

572
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,051
against his will. Last Sunday,
the Führer wanted to help me leave.

573
00:54:53,061 --> 00:54:55,575
You know your mother well.
We have the same blood.

574
00:54:56,021 --> 00:54:59,696
I had no second thoughts.
Our magnificent idea has died...

575
00:55:00,141 --> 00:55:03,611
along with every beautiful,
admirable, noble, good thing

576
00:55:04,061 --> 00:55:06,734
I've ever known.
The world after the Führer's death

577
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:10,219
and after National Socialism
is no longer worth living in.

578
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:12,254
That's why the children are here.

579
00:55:13,342 --> 00:55:15,378
They are too good for what will come.

580
00:55:15,822 --> 00:55:21,055
A merciful God will understand me
for giving them redemption.

581
00:55:27,902 --> 00:55:32,101
I'll wear the golden bracelet with
the green stone until the very end.

582
00:55:32,783 --> 00:55:35,343
Then it may be taken from me,
and you shall wear it

583
00:55:35,783 --> 00:55:37,853
just as I have always worn it.

584
00:55:39,023 --> 00:55:42,572
I'm afraid I sent my diamond watch
to the jeweler's.

585
00:55:43,023 --> 00:55:44,741
I wrote the address at the bottom.

586
00:55:45,303 --> 00:55:47,771
If you're lucky, you can get it back.

587
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,259
I want you to have it.

588
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:53,619
You'll also get the diamond bracelet

589
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:58,182
and the topaz pendant which
the Führer gave me for my birthday.

590
00:55:59,584 --> 00:56:02,462
The bill I'm including for
Heise & Co. Hasn't been paid yet.

591
00:56:02,904 --> 00:56:06,340
You might receive some other bills,
too, but not for more

592
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:08,456
than 1,500 Reichsmarks.

593
00:56:10,304 --> 00:56:16,983
Please burn all private and business
letters to the Führer at once.

594
00:56:17,905 --> 00:56:20,942
I'm also sending you
food and cigarettes.

595
00:56:21,385 --> 00:56:24,422
Please give Lindners and Kathl
some of the coffee.

596
00:56:24,865 --> 00:56:28,221
The cigarettes are for Mandi.
The tobacco is for Papa.

597
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:30,178
The chocolate is for Mom.

598
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,584
That's all I can tell you.
It's enough for now.

599
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:39,741
I wish you the best of luck,
my dearest sister.

600
00:56:40,186 --> 00:56:41,585
And remember,

601
00:56:42,026 --> 00:56:44,745
I'm sure you'll see Hermann again.
Best regards

602
00:56:45,186 --> 00:56:47,381
and kisses. I remain...

603
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:50,655
your sister...

604
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:40,468
Inge!

605
00:58:28,951 --> 00:58:33,183
Listen Keitel,
I want you to leave tonight.

606
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:37,340
Make your way to Dönitz.
Help him organize everything.

607
00:58:38,272 --> 00:58:41,469
We have to get things moving again.

608
00:58:42,432 --> 00:58:43,990
I don't understand.

609
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:48,382
It's a disaster.
We have no more oilfields.

610
00:58:49,032 --> 00:58:53,548
It's impossible to carry out
far-ranging operations.

611
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:59,229
Once I've managed this situation,
we must recover the oilfields.

612
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:06,901
Any more questions?

613
00:59:07,873 --> 00:59:08,669
No, my Führer.

614
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:12,106
Fine. Have a nice trip.

615
01:00:34,837 --> 01:00:38,466
"My Führer, Following your decision
to stay in Berlin,

616
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:41,511
do I have your approval
as Vice Chancellor

617
01:00:41,957 --> 01:00:44,153
to immediately take charge
of the entire Reich...

618
01:00:45,118 --> 01:00:47,837
with the necessary power
and authority?

619
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:51,270
If I receive no answer
by 10 p. m., I will assume

620
01:00:51,718 --> 01:00:53,788
that you have been incapacitated.

621
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:57,036
I will serve the well-being
of our people and fatherland. "

622
01:00:58,558 --> 01:00:59,673
He's betraying Germany...

623
01:01:00,478 --> 01:01:01,308
and you!

624
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,432
Göring's concern isn't unjustified.

625
01:01:04,879 --> 01:01:07,029
If our communication system
breaks down,

626
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:09,191
which could happen any time,

627
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:11,311
we'd be cut off from the world.

628
01:01:11,759 --> 01:01:13,670
We could no longer pass on orders.

629
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:16,997
I see it differently.
Göring wants to seize power.

630
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:21,717
I never trusted that mob he gathered
at Obersalzberg. It stinks of a coup.

631
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:27,153
That failure! That bloodsucker!

632
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,239
A parvenu! A lazybones!

633
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,554
How dare he declare me
unable to act!

634
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,639
Tomorrow he might declare me dead!
- Hello, Frau Junge.

635
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,433
How did you reach Berlin?

636
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,394
It wasn't easy.
I have to see the Führer.

637
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,592
I'd wait if I were you.

638
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,554
The air force...

639
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:48,832
What did he do with it?

640
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:52,273
That's reason enough
to execute him!

641
01:01:52,721 --> 01:01:58,717
That morphine addict
helped to corrupt this country.

642
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:01,000
And now this!

643
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,759
He has betrayed me.

644
01:02:05,801 --> 01:02:08,475
Me!

645
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:18,961
I want Göring to be deprived of power
and removed from office.

646
01:02:20,042 --> 01:02:22,033
If I don't survive this war...

647
01:02:23,122 --> 01:02:26,319
that man is to be executed at once.

648
01:02:27,963 --> 01:02:29,316
What about us?

649
01:02:30,723 --> 01:02:31,758
Is there any hope?

650
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:36,953
Leave before it's too late.

651
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:42,474
The Führer wants to stay here.
We can't leave him alone.

652
01:02:43,123 --> 01:02:45,432
For that which awaits the Führer,
he won't need anyone.

653
01:02:45,883 --> 01:02:47,794
Least of all you.

654
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:52,040
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
are staying. The children too.

655
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:03,235
But the children...

656
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,679
I'd always thought that...

657
01:03:10,645 --> 01:03:13,079
I thought there was some way out...

658
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:20,881
Come in.

659
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:25,921
Albert... hello.

660
01:03:37,206 --> 01:03:38,275
Fever?

661
01:03:39,526 --> 01:03:42,677
Albert, my heart can't take it.

662
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:47,121
Why don't you take the children
and get out of here?

663
01:03:47,566 --> 01:03:49,557
But where to?

664
01:03:50,887 --> 01:03:55,005
I once told you, I can send a barge
to Schwanenwerder.

665
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:58,800
It can be fixed up as a hideout
until it's all over...

666
01:03:59,967 --> 01:04:01,525
which won't be long.

667
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:04,561
I've thought it through carefully.

668
01:04:05,607 --> 01:04:10,078
I won't let the children grow up in
a world with no National Socialism.

669
01:04:13,768 --> 01:04:15,838
Think it over again, Magda.

670
01:04:16,888 --> 01:04:18,287
The children deserve a future.

671
01:04:22,368 --> 01:04:27,078
If the idea of National Socialism
dies, there is no future.

672
01:04:42,849 --> 01:04:44,487
I can't believe you really want this.

673
01:04:47,169 --> 01:04:48,318
Go...

674
01:05:19,411 --> 01:05:20,969
Come in.

675
01:05:25,131 --> 01:05:30,524
I knew you'd come. You're not one
of those who'd abandon the Führer.

676
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:37,326
I... I've just come
to say goodbye to the Führer.

677
01:05:38,092 --> 01:05:41,289
I have to return to Hamburg tonight.
- Of course.

678
01:05:41,732 --> 01:05:43,085
Take a seat.

679
01:05:45,412 --> 01:05:48,768
Look, I brought some of the furniture
you designed for me.

680
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:51,168
I just couldn't part with it.

681
01:05:51,612 --> 01:05:55,571
Come on, help yourself. I bet
you haven't eaten all day.

682
01:05:56,893 --> 01:05:58,770
You happen to be right.

683
01:06:00,053 --> 01:06:00,883
Thanks.

684
01:06:02,213 --> 01:06:04,488
It's so important that you came.

685
01:06:04,933 --> 01:06:06,844
It shows him you're on his side.

686
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,492
Did he have his doubts?

687
01:06:11,253 --> 01:06:14,928
He's been wondering
if you were possibly against him.

688
01:06:15,373 --> 01:06:18,605
But I kept telling him you'd come.
And now you're here.

689
01:06:23,694 --> 01:06:26,367
It pleased him that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

690
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,326
I think it's the right choice, too.

691
01:06:32,454 --> 01:06:34,285
You know what?

692
01:06:35,214 --> 01:06:36,408
It may be crazy, but...

693
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,529
I'm really happy to be able to stay.

694
01:06:42,695 --> 01:06:44,526
And I'm not afraid.

695
01:06:53,335 --> 01:06:54,484
Yes?

696
01:07:09,056 --> 01:07:11,809
So... you've come.

697
01:07:12,376 --> 01:07:14,492
My Führer...

698
01:07:14,936 --> 01:07:19,214
It's okay... Let's sit down.

699
01:07:36,817 --> 01:07:41,494
I had such big plans
for the Germans and for the world.

700
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:48,458
No one understood me,
not even my oldest comrades.

701
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:58,055
What huge opportunities we had.
The world was within reach...

702
01:08:01,179 --> 01:08:02,407
Too late.

703
01:08:08,779 --> 01:08:13,455
What I am proud of is that
I openly confronted the Jews...

704
01:08:15,339 --> 01:08:19,537
and I cleansed the German lands
of Jewish poison.

705
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,939
It isn't hard for me to go.
Just that one moment...

706
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,820
...and then eternal peace.

707
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,657
Spare the German people, my Führer.

708
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:50,016
If my own people fail this test,

709
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:52,816
I will shed not one tear for them.

710
01:08:53,781 --> 01:08:55,737
They deserve nothing else.

711
01:08:56,181 --> 01:09:00,732
It's their own destiny.
They themselves are to blame.

712
01:09:06,662 --> 01:09:07,936
For months...

713
01:09:09,862 --> 01:09:12,092
I must tell you this, my Führer...

714
01:09:13,462 --> 01:09:16,056
For months I have not carried out
your orders of destruction.

715
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:22,099
Documents exist which prove
that I not only ignored,

716
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:25,103
but even acted
contrary to your orders.

717
01:09:30,343 --> 01:09:32,174
I had to tell you.

718
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:44,133
My personal loyalty to you
never wavered throughout.

719
01:09:57,664 --> 01:09:59,780
So, you're leaving...

720
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:05,339
Fine. Goodbye.

721
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:18,418
I wish you all the best.

722
01:10:39,342 --> 01:10:42,300
So gentlemen, eat your fill.

723
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,574
Peter!

724
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:49,461
Everything's okay, my boy.

725
01:12:04,706 --> 01:12:05,741
Fever.

726
01:12:08,346 --> 01:12:09,984
Yes, but he's alive.

727
01:12:33,588 --> 01:12:35,579
Courage and loyalty still exist.

728
01:12:37,868 --> 01:12:42,066
Lord von Greim and Frau Reitsch,
I am pleased that...

729
01:12:43,788 --> 01:12:45,858
you both arrived uninjured,

730
01:12:46,308 --> 01:12:47,787
more or less.

731
01:12:48,228 --> 01:12:49,661
Be seated.

732
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:54,581
We were under heavy fire
but were able to land in Gatow.

733
01:12:55,069 --> 01:12:58,220
The roads were impassable,
so...

734
01:12:58,669 --> 01:13:02,628
we got a plane, a Fieseler Storch,
and flew over the Russian lines,

735
01:13:03,069 --> 01:13:06,186
landing on the East-West axis,
a few hundred meters from here.

736
01:13:06,629 --> 01:13:09,348
Just before landing,
we got hit by Russian artillery.

737
01:13:10,589 --> 01:13:15,664
General von Greim, I appoint you
Commander in Chief of the Air Force

738
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:18,704
and General Field Marshal.

739
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:20,947
A great responsibility

740
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:25,588
rests on your shoulders. You must
shake up the entire air force.

741
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:29,227
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

742
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,667
Life never forgives weakness.

743
01:13:35,351 --> 01:13:38,502
This so-called humanity...

744
01:13:38,951 --> 01:13:40,623
is just priests' drivel.

745
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:46,868
Compassion is a primal sin.
Compassion for the weak...

746
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:49,308
is a betrayal of nature.

747
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:50,979
The strongest

748
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:55,140
can only be victorious
by eradicating the weak.

749
01:13:55,592 --> 01:13:58,106
I have always obeyed
this law of nature

750
01:13:58,552 --> 01:14:01,783
by never permitting myself
to feel compassion.

751
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,862
I have ruthlessly suppressed
domestic opposition and

752
01:14:07,312 --> 01:14:10,622
brutally crushed the resistance
of alien races.

753
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:12,505
It's the only way to deal with it.

754
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:14,947
Apes, for example,

755
01:14:16,993 --> 01:14:20,781
trample every outsider to death.

756
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:26,349
What goes for apes
goes even more for human beings.

757
01:14:33,313 --> 01:14:35,781
In Lübeck, Himmler has made an offer

758
01:14:37,233 --> 01:14:40,704
to surrender to the western powers

759
01:14:41,434 --> 01:14:43,709
through Count Bernadotte...

760
01:14:44,754 --> 01:14:47,632
...according to a report
by English radio.

761
01:14:51,674 --> 01:14:52,948
Himmler...

762
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:57,433
Of all people, Himmler!

763
01:14:57,874 --> 01:15:00,469
The truest of the true!

764
01:15:01,075 --> 01:15:03,748
This is the worst betrayal of all!

765
01:15:08,555 --> 01:15:10,273
Göring, of course. He was corrupt...

766
01:15:12,386 --> 01:15:15,502
Speer, an idealistic,
unpredictable artist!

767
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:17,776
All the others! Yes! Yes! Yes!

768
01:15:19,065 --> 01:15:20,417
But not Himmler.

769
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:24,538
Has he gone crazy?

770
01:15:25,423 --> 01:15:28,859
He claimed authority
by saying that I was sick,

771
01:15:30,062 --> 01:15:31,814
perhaps already dead.

772
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:42,018
Please leave me alone with
Lord von Greim and Frau Reitsch.

773
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,689
And bring me Fegelein.

774
01:15:46,299 --> 01:15:48,255
My Führer, we don't know where he is.

775
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:52,129
But he's Himmler's adjutant,
he must be here!

776
01:15:52,578 --> 01:15:53,851
We haven't seen him for days.

777
01:15:54,297 --> 01:15:56,049
I want his report at once!

778
01:15:59,576 --> 01:16:01,168
Please stay, Doctor.

779
01:16:06,575 --> 01:16:09,213
You and Greim are to leave at once.

780
01:16:09,654 --> 01:16:12,963
Fly to Dönitz. Tell him
to do everything necessary

781
01:16:13,413 --> 01:16:16,052
to ensure Himmler receives
just punishment.

782
01:16:16,493 --> 01:16:20,121
My Führer, Lord von Greim and I
have decided to die with you here.

783
01:16:23,091 --> 01:16:25,127
Thank you for this sign of loyalty.

784
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:28,598
But Himmler must die.

785
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:30,369
He committed treason!

786
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:35,242
It was the right decision
not to inform him of my plans.

787
01:16:35,689 --> 01:16:36,599
My Führer?

788
01:16:37,528 --> 01:16:41,077
Do you think I'd stand by and watch
those Jewish pigs do me in?

789
01:16:41,528 --> 01:16:44,599
This is all part
of a gigantic ploy.

790
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:46,366
I allowed the enemy

791
01:16:46,806 --> 01:16:51,401
to invade the Reich. They believe
they've won, but you'll see, Greim.

792
01:16:51,845 --> 01:16:54,484
It'll be a rude awakening for them.

793
01:16:54,925 --> 01:16:58,473
Dönitz is mobilizing troops in
the north, Kesselring in the south.

794
01:16:58,924 --> 01:17:03,121
We will crush the enemy
in a massive pincer movement.

795
01:17:03,563 --> 01:17:08,511
And I have 3 armies near Prague
which will attack from behind.

796
01:17:09,322 --> 01:17:13,758
I had no idea that we still have
so many troops available.

797
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:18,150
I have made arrangements
that within a short time

798
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,387
you will have thousands
of jet fighter aircraft,

799
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:26,877
so you can make the air force
as powerful as it once was!

800
01:17:27,318 --> 01:17:32,311
I kneel down to your genius and
before the altar of our fatherland.

801
01:17:46,234 --> 01:17:47,667
Heil, my Führer.

802
01:17:51,113 --> 01:17:54,150
You have requested to leave Berlin?

803
01:17:55,592 --> 01:18:00,062
As you know,
all the medical units and staff

804
01:18:00,511 --> 01:18:03,389
under Himmler's authority
have left Berlin.

805
01:18:03,831 --> 01:18:07,823
Himmler is a traitor. He will receive
the punishment he deserves.

806
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:13,145
As an SS physician,
I have no more duties here.

807
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:17,547
Your application to leave Berlin
is completely unacceptable.

808
01:18:18,947 --> 01:18:21,461
My... family...

809
01:18:22,427 --> 01:18:25,577
If the Russians find me here...
I have to leave!

810
01:18:26,026 --> 01:18:28,937
You did nothing wrong.
Future generations

811
01:18:29,385 --> 01:18:33,821
will be thankful
for the medical research you did.

812
01:18:34,264 --> 01:18:36,573
I'll take responsibility for it all.

813
01:18:41,943 --> 01:18:44,137
Let's discuss this another time.

814
01:18:58,299 --> 01:19:00,290
We can't find
Gruppenführer Fegelein.

815
01:19:00,979 --> 01:19:05,415
He is not in the bunker.
- What do you mean, "can't find him"?

816
01:19:05,858 --> 01:19:07,449
Then look for him!

817
01:19:07,897 --> 01:19:10,491
I want to see Fegelein at once!

818
01:19:10,937 --> 01:19:15,248
If he's gone AWOL,
it's desertion! Treason!

819
01:19:15,696 --> 01:19:18,368
Bring me Fegelein!

820
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:20,766
Fegelein! Fegelein!

821
01:19:31,172 --> 01:19:33,322
Dad, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

822
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:39,771
Ernst... is something wrong?

823
01:19:40,211 --> 01:19:41,962
No... Thank you.

824
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,965
Gitte is hungry, too.

825
01:19:48,089 --> 01:19:51,683
Well, Ilse,
now you have to eat something, too.

826
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,846
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

827
01:19:59,886 --> 01:20:01,080
Thank you.

828
01:20:52,995 --> 01:20:54,064
What's going on?

829
01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:55,789
You're under arrest.

830
01:20:57,395 --> 01:20:59,032
What?
- For desertion.

831
01:20:59,474 --> 01:21:01,465
Get dressed. You must come with us.

832
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:04,030
Kiss my ass!

833
01:21:08,592 --> 01:21:11,390
Let go, you bastard!
You got no right!

834
01:21:13,671 --> 01:21:16,390
Please don't let them kill Hermann.

835
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:19,585
He wanted to flee,
it's beyond doubt.

836
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:24,224
So what?
It's all over anyway.

837
01:21:24,669 --> 01:21:27,466
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant!

838
01:21:27,908 --> 01:21:31,105
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

839
01:21:33,827 --> 01:21:36,136
There is no compassion for traitors.

840
01:21:36,586 --> 01:21:38,383
There is no mercy for traitors.

841
01:21:40,626 --> 01:21:42,661
He'll be court-martialled and shot.

842
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:46,701
What good is that now?

843
01:21:48,584 --> 01:21:50,222
It is my will!

844
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:04,814
You're the Führer.

845
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,094
Go ahead.

846
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,769
The Russians are breaking through
everywhere.

847
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,892
There are no reserves left,
and air support has stopped.

848
01:22:15,738 --> 01:22:18,172
There's no way
to bring in more ammunition.

849
01:22:22,777 --> 01:22:24,653
The Russians have reached
Weidendammer Bridge,

850
01:22:25,096 --> 01:22:27,894
Lustgarten to the east,
Potsdamer Platz to the south

851
01:22:28,936 --> 01:22:30,368
and Tiergarten to the west,

852
01:22:30,815 --> 01:22:32,885
300-400 meters from the Chancellery.

853
01:22:33,335 --> 01:22:34,926
How long can you hold out?

854
01:22:35,374 --> 01:22:36,773
One or two days at most.

855
01:22:37,214 --> 01:22:38,613
The government district too?

856
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,202
Yes, my Führer.

857
01:22:40,973 --> 01:22:43,646
My Führer,
as a soldier I suggest

858
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:46,162
we try to break through
the encirclement.

859
01:22:46,612 --> 01:22:48,886
During the fight for Berlin

860
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,970
we've already lost
15-20,000 of the younger officers.

861
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:55,086
But that's what young men are for.

862
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:59,124
Your suggestion is absurd! Insane!

863
01:22:59,569 --> 01:23:01,002
Think of the thousands

864
01:23:01,449 --> 01:23:03,246
of wounded. We can't help them now.

865
01:23:03,688 --> 01:23:04,723
My Führer...

866
01:23:05,168 --> 01:23:08,239
the orders are ready.
I give you my word...

867
01:23:08,687 --> 01:23:11,520
The Führer can't just disappear
from history

868
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:14,685
like some inglorious fugitive!
- Even if we got out

869
01:23:15,126 --> 01:23:21,394
successfully, I'd only be escaping
one trap to fall into another.

870
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:24,483
I'd have to sleep in the open air
or in a farmhouse

871
01:23:24,924 --> 01:23:26,482
or something similar

872
01:23:26,924 --> 01:23:29,357
and wait for the end to come.

873
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:32,318
Wenck is approaching
with the 12th army.

874
01:23:32,762 --> 01:23:35,071
He can unite
with Busse's 9th Army

875
01:23:35,522 --> 01:23:39,753
and inflict a crushing blow
on the Russians to save us all.

876
01:23:40,401 --> 01:23:43,392
Wenck is a man of excellence.

877
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,034
Telegraph Keitel.

878
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,158
Report to me

879
01:23:49,599 --> 01:23:54,956
immediately: First, where are
Wenck's front lines? Second,

880
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,353
when are they attacking? Third,

881
01:23:57,797 --> 01:23:59,549
where is the 9th Army?

882
01:23:59,997 --> 01:24:03,671
Fourth, where will the 9th Army
break through?

883
01:24:05,356 --> 01:24:09,348
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be proved right.

884
01:24:10,275 --> 01:24:12,947
Wenck will come.

885
01:24:18,913 --> 01:24:21,346
Wenck will come.

886
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:37,543
I want to know if it's possible
for Wenck to attack or not.

887
01:24:38,269 --> 01:24:42,466
It's unlikely that Wenck's small
force can attack the Red Army...

888
01:24:42,908 --> 01:24:44,704
How dare you say it's unlikely?

889
01:24:45,147 --> 01:24:47,707
Wenck has nothing
to confront the Red Army!

890
01:24:48,147 --> 01:24:49,977
Why don't you tell the Führer?

891
01:24:50,626 --> 01:24:53,857
Have you all gone crazy?
- The Führer knows it himself!

892
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:56,580
But he will never surrender!
And we won't either!

893
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:59,379
I went through that before!
And once is enough!

894
01:24:59,824 --> 01:25:02,099
Come on. I have to get out of here.

895
01:25:11,742 --> 01:25:12,697
Stopp!

896
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:26,251
Heil Hitler!

897
01:26:13,449 --> 01:26:15,405
Sorry, I fell asleep.

898
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:19,001
So you rested up a bit, dear?

899
01:26:21,767 --> 01:26:24,235
Take it in shorthand.

900
01:26:29,446 --> 01:26:31,197
My political testament.

901
01:26:34,405 --> 01:26:35,599
Since 1914,

902
01:26:36,044 --> 01:26:38,604
when I invested my modest strength

903
01:26:39,044 --> 01:26:43,355
in the First World War,
which was forced upon the Reich,

904
01:26:43,923 --> 01:26:46,436
over 30 years have passed.

905
01:26:48,202 --> 01:26:52,672
In those 3 decades, all my thoughts,
actions and my life

906
01:26:53,121 --> 01:26:57,511
were dictated by my love for
and loyalty to the German people.

907
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:01,558
Sorry, but the heavy gunfire...

908
01:27:01,999 --> 01:27:03,671
You sit there.

909
01:27:07,398 --> 01:27:10,230
Centuries will pass,

910
01:27:10,757 --> 01:27:14,147
but from the ruins of our cities
and cultural monuments

911
01:27:15,276 --> 01:27:19,951
our hatred will be renewed
for those who are responsible,

912
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,269
the people to whom we owe all this:

913
01:27:23,715 --> 01:27:27,548
The international Jewry
and its supporters.

914
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:39,343
What's wrong, Herr Minister?

915
01:27:43,151 --> 01:27:45,618
Imagine!
The Führer wants me to leave Berlin.

916
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:49,219
He ordered me to leave.

917
01:27:51,149 --> 01:27:53,901
I've never disobeyed
one of the Führer's orders. Never!

918
01:28:02,587 --> 01:28:05,658
But I will not obey this order.

919
01:28:06,586 --> 01:28:09,304
I will stand by the Führer.

920
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:15,702
I'm sorry, Frau Junge, but...

921
01:28:16,144 --> 01:28:19,180
I have to dictate
my personal testament to you.

922
01:28:20,943 --> 01:28:22,978
I'm typing the Führer's testament.

923
01:28:25,102 --> 01:28:26,296
Fine.

924
01:28:27,901 --> 01:28:29,459
I understand. I'll get back to you.

925
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:41,132
My Führer, I...
The Race Laws require me

926
01:28:41,578 --> 01:28:45,571
to ask you this: My Führer,
are you of pure Aryan descent?

927
01:28:48,457 --> 01:28:52,654
Yes.
- May I see your ID?

928
01:28:53,576 --> 01:28:56,214
You're talking to the Führer.
- Yes, sir.

929
01:28:57,295 --> 01:28:59,968
And are you, Frau Braun,
of pure Aryan descent?

930
01:29:00,415 --> 01:29:04,043
Yes. - Then the matter is...
There are no obstacles...

931
01:29:04,774 --> 01:29:08,209
I ask you:
Do you, my Führer Adolf Hitler,

932
01:29:08,653 --> 01:29:14,284
take Eva Braun to be your
lawful wedded wife? - I do.

933
01:29:15,811 --> 01:29:17,369
Do you, Eva Braun, take

934
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:23,806
the Führer Adolf Hitler to be your
lawful wedded husband? - I do.

935
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:27,805
I hereby declare you
man and wife.

936
01:30:05,361 --> 01:30:06,953
I need two men!

937
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,036
You'll be okay.

938
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,630
The Führer wants to see you at once.
- At this hour?

939
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:35,587
How long can you hold out?

940
01:30:36,155 --> 01:30:38,509
Perhaps 20 hours. No longer.

941
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:42,227
The Russians are just
a few hundred meters away.

942
01:30:42,753 --> 01:30:45,028
For the moment we've stopped them.

943
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:49,988
Know what, Mohnke?
The Western democracies are decadent.

944
01:30:51,232 --> 01:30:55,065
They will be defeated by
those disciplined people of the East.

945
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:01,549
All the best. Thank you.

946
01:31:02,349 --> 01:31:04,909
It wasn't only for Germany.

947
01:31:24,705 --> 01:31:25,773
Keitel's report.

948
01:31:29,624 --> 01:31:32,899
First, Wenck is stuck
south of Lake Schwielow.

949
01:31:33,343 --> 01:31:37,017
Second, the 12th Army cannot
continue its assault on Berlin.

950
01:31:37,622 --> 01:31:41,330
Third, the bulk of the 9th Army
is encircled.

951
01:32:00,537 --> 01:32:02,687
My Führer, we need instructions

952
01:32:03,137 --> 01:32:05,696
in case we run out of ammunition.

953
01:32:06,856 --> 01:32:09,688
I will never surrender. Never.

954
01:32:11,575 --> 01:32:17,285
I forbid you to surrender. That goes
for every other commander as well.

955
01:32:27,532 --> 01:32:33,321
Listen, Günsche. Frau Braun...
my wife and I will commit suicide.

956
01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:38,047
But I don't want the Russians
to exhibit my body in some museum.

957
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:40,878
Don't let me fall
into their hands, dead or alive!

958
01:32:41,729 --> 01:32:45,437
I want my body to be burned,
so it can never be found.

959
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:50,443
Günsche...

960
01:32:50,887 --> 01:32:54,845
Promise you will make
all necessary arrangements

961
01:32:55,286 --> 01:32:57,958
for the disposal
of my mortal remains.

962
01:32:58,485 --> 01:32:59,554
My Führer...

963
01:33:01,245 --> 01:33:03,394
This is a terrible order,
but I will carry it out.

964
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:33,596
Kempka. - Erich,
I need 200 liters of gasoline.

965
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:36,836
Are you crazy?
Where do I get that much gasoline?

966
01:33:37,277 --> 01:33:39,711
From the parked vehicles.
No one needs them now.

967
01:33:40,157 --> 01:33:41,589
Why do you need so much gas?

968
01:33:42,036 --> 01:33:43,469
I can't tell you on the phone.

969
01:33:59,273 --> 01:34:00,944
Come with me, please.

970
01:34:01,392 --> 01:34:02,620
The Führer wants to see us.

971
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:12,827
Should I tell him you can't come?

972
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:18,661
It's my pneumothorax.

973
01:34:19,349 --> 01:34:21,782
I won't last much longer anyway.

974
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:07,215
Excuse me, Madam.

975
01:35:18,576 --> 01:35:21,010
This way, Professor.

976
01:35:29,694 --> 01:35:30,843
Please wait here.

977
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:42,084
Excuse me...

978
01:36:14,445 --> 01:36:17,754
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

979
01:36:18,204 --> 01:36:22,481
My Führer, preserve our belief
in the final victory!

980
01:36:23,323 --> 01:36:26,632
Lead us, and we will follow you!

981
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:32,996
Come on.

982
01:36:39,599 --> 01:36:42,352
Come in and join us!

983
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,114
Here, have a drink.

984
01:36:47,838 --> 01:36:50,749
Drinking's all we have left.
- Have a seat.

985
01:36:51,557 --> 01:36:52,626
That's better.

986
01:36:53,437 --> 01:36:55,586
Yes sir, our situation is hopeless.

987
01:36:56,036 --> 01:36:58,709
It's what you call shitty!

988
01:37:01,915 --> 01:37:03,314
Be seated.

989
01:37:03,754 --> 01:37:06,871
We are honored, Fräulein...
Frau...

990
01:37:07,314 --> 01:37:09,190
You may call me Frau Hitler.

991
01:37:11,953 --> 01:37:13,544
Don't worry, it's all right.

992
01:37:16,072 --> 01:37:19,063
Pity we can't go outside anymore.

993
01:37:19,511 --> 01:37:21,706
Only if you want a hero's death.

994
01:37:22,231 --> 01:37:24,460
Fritz, pull yourself together!

995
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:27,861
Yes, sir! Pull myself together!

996
01:37:29,789 --> 01:37:30,744
Duck!

997
01:37:40,347 --> 01:37:41,826
That was a close call.

998
01:37:49,105 --> 01:37:51,061
Heil Hitler!

999
01:37:51,745 --> 01:37:54,861
Obersturmbannführer, what's up?
- I must report to the Führer.

1000
01:37:55,624 --> 01:37:56,817
Not now. Have a seat.

1001
01:37:57,543 --> 01:37:59,534
Sit down, drink up.

1002
01:38:03,782 --> 01:38:05,500
May I introduce you to Frau Hitler?

1003
01:38:06,741 --> 01:38:09,892
So young and so many medals!
You must be proud of yourself.

1004
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,814
I must go.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

1005
01:38:16,259 --> 01:38:19,251
You can use our toilet. Go ahead.

1006
01:38:26,377 --> 01:38:29,130
If your hand shakes, the bullet

1007
01:38:29,577 --> 01:38:33,694
might only destroy the optic nerve.
That's why it's advisable

1008
01:38:34,136 --> 01:38:35,534
to take poison too.

1009
01:38:37,775 --> 01:38:41,687
Pull the trigger
the moment you bite the capsule.

1010
01:38:42,134 --> 01:38:44,250
Will I have enough time to do it?

1011
01:38:44,694 --> 01:38:48,129
The poison takes effect
after 1 or 2 seconds.

1012
01:39:04,449 --> 01:39:07,043
Tornow, you too.

1013
01:39:15,767 --> 01:39:17,200
Come on, Blondi.

1014
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:49,958
Frau Junge, I've known him...

1015
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,318
my husband... for over 15 years.

1016
01:39:53,759 --> 01:39:57,512
But when I think about it,
I don't know anything about him.

1017
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:00,789
Although he likes to talk.

1018
01:40:03,557 --> 01:40:08,152
I was looking forward to Berlin.
But he's changed so much.

1019
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:12,232
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian meals.

1020
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:15,435
I really hate Blondi.

1021
01:40:17,074 --> 01:40:21,988
Sometimes I kick her secretly, then
Adolf wonders about her behavior.

1022
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:34,381
It seems he doesn't want
anyone to see inside him.

1023
01:40:35,511 --> 01:40:37,387
I mean deep inside.

1024
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:41,868
In private, he can be
such a caring person.

1025
01:40:44,069 --> 01:40:48,584
But then he says...
such brutal things.

1026
01:40:49,148 --> 01:40:50,581
When he's the Führer?

1027
01:40:52,947 --> 01:40:55,381
Come on, let's have a smoke.

1028
01:41:16,622 --> 01:41:18,101
I'm sorry.

1029
01:41:20,181 --> 01:41:23,253
You've so many worries,
and I sit here whining.

1030
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:28,770
Frau Junge, let me give you
this coat as a going-away present.

1031
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:34,133
I love well-dressed women. I want
you to have it and to enjoy it.

1032
01:41:35,538 --> 01:41:38,291
What a surprise. Thank you.

1033
01:41:38,897 --> 01:41:41,809
I have no idea
where and when I could wear it.

1034
01:41:44,256 --> 01:41:49,648
Please... try to get out of here.
Promise me.

1035
01:43:15,797 --> 01:43:20,824
Thank you, that was very good,
Fräulein Manziarly.

1036
01:43:40,832 --> 01:43:43,141
The time has come.

1037
01:43:43,592 --> 01:43:45,388
It's over now.

1038
01:44:21,624 --> 01:44:23,420
The Führer wants to say farewell.

1039
01:44:54,737 --> 01:44:57,091
You're the bravest mother
in the whole Reich.

1040
01:44:57,776 --> 01:45:01,610
My Führer, you've made me
the happiest woman in Germany.

1041
01:45:25,411 --> 01:45:26,684
Give my regards to Bavaria.

1042
01:45:50,125 --> 01:45:54,879
Why are you here? - We want to see
Aunt Eva and Uncle Hitler.

1043
01:45:55,644 --> 01:45:59,034
Have you had anything to eat?
- Just breakfast.

1044
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:02,836
I'll get you something to eat
and be right back, okay?

1045
01:46:03,283 --> 01:46:04,556
Okay.

1046
01:46:12,801 --> 01:46:17,635
Comrades, have you heard
the latest news from outside?

1047
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:22,357
Berlin's a city of warehouses.
Where's my house? Where's my house?

1048
01:46:27,918 --> 01:46:31,148
Herr Günsche,
I have to see the Führer.

1049
01:46:31,797 --> 01:46:36,347
Please! - The Führer does not want
to be disturbed by anyone.

1050
01:46:36,796 --> 01:46:38,945
Please, Günsche. Just one moment.

1051
01:46:40,275 --> 01:46:41,071
Please!

1052
01:46:48,673 --> 01:46:50,629
My Führer, Frau Goebbels is here.

1053
01:46:56,992 --> 01:46:58,026
What now?

1054
01:46:59,071 --> 01:47:02,779
My Führer, I beg you
to leave Berlin!

1055
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:05,507
My Führer, please...

1056
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:10,101
Don't leave us!
What will become of us?

1057
01:47:13,068 --> 01:47:16,185
Tomorrow millions of people
will curse me,

1058
01:47:16,628 --> 01:47:18,777
but fate has taken its course.

1059
01:47:22,626 --> 01:47:25,094
Get up... Come on.

1060
01:47:27,305 --> 01:47:28,579
Come on...

1061
01:47:36,743 --> 01:47:39,974
Aunt Traudl,
I really like those loud booms!

1062
01:47:41,142 --> 01:47:43,178
Why?
- Nothing can happen to us here,

1063
01:47:43,662 --> 01:47:44,492
can it?

1064
01:47:45,142 --> 01:47:46,494
You're right.

1065
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:56,772
Bull's eye!

1066
01:48:18,975 --> 01:48:22,091
Herr Reichsleiter,
it has happened.

1067
01:48:40,570 --> 01:48:42,083
The Führer is dead.

1068
01:48:58,007 --> 01:48:59,075
There's Papa.

1069
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:12,238
Are you crazy?

1070
01:49:12,684 --> 01:49:16,801
That gasoline has caused...
- Be quiet, Erich.

1071
01:49:27,201 --> 01:49:28,553
Step back!

1072
01:49:41,318 --> 01:49:43,069
Come on!

1073
01:49:43,517 --> 01:49:44,996
Come on!

1074
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:10,094
No! Don't!

1075
01:51:16,098 --> 01:51:18,407
Let go of Grandma!

1076
01:51:22,857 --> 01:51:24,608
Order... Order...

1077
01:51:28,255 --> 01:51:30,610
Order must be restored!

1078
01:51:35,214 --> 01:51:36,647
Run, Grandpa, run!

1079
01:51:38,653 --> 01:51:40,245
Go after those two!

1080
01:51:44,052 --> 01:51:46,805
Here, this way!
We know our way through the ruins!

1081
01:51:47,252 --> 01:51:48,809
Trust us! Hurry!

1082
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:59,883
I WAS ON THE SIDE
OF THE RED BEASTS

1083
01:52:02,408 --> 01:52:04,364
I SUPPORTED THE BOLSHEVIKS.

1084
01:52:11,487 --> 01:52:13,522
I hope the Russians got our message.

1085
01:52:13,966 --> 01:52:17,435
We'll know in a minute.
- Or maybe not.

1086
01:52:21,844 --> 01:52:23,482
What news do you bring us, General?

1087
01:52:25,164 --> 01:52:27,552
Hitler and his wife committed suicide

1088
01:52:28,003 --> 01:52:29,800
in the Führer's bunker.

1089
01:52:33,362 --> 01:52:36,159
The new government has empowered me

1090
01:52:36,601 --> 01:52:38,751
to begin peace negotiations.

1091
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,633
Between our two countries which have

1092
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:48,229
suffered the highest casualties.

1093
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:51,746
General, would you want peace

1094
01:52:52,198 --> 01:52:53,756
in my position?

1095
01:52:54,198 --> 01:52:56,472
My government will not accept

1096
01:52:56,917 --> 01:52:59,192
an unconditional surrender.

1097
01:53:00,956 --> 01:53:02,912
Under the circumstances,

1098
01:53:03,356 --> 01:53:05,346
there's no other alternative.

1099
01:53:07,995 --> 01:53:10,224
We'll never surrender! Outrageous!

1100
01:53:11,114 --> 01:53:14,389
I conquered Berlin against the Reds
years ago! And I will defend it

1101
01:53:14,833 --> 01:53:18,428
against the Reds to my dying breath!

1102
01:53:18,873 --> 01:53:21,306
I won't use my final hours

1103
01:53:21,752 --> 01:53:24,185
as Reich Chancellor to sign a

1104
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:25,984
statement of surrender!

1105
01:53:26,431 --> 01:53:29,740
We must protect civilians!
- The Führer's order is final!

1106
01:53:30,190 --> 01:53:32,021
Have you gone mad?

1107
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:33,585
We have to negotiate.

1108
01:53:34,029 --> 01:53:36,145
I repeat, gentlemen,

1109
01:53:36,589 --> 01:53:39,307
I will never agree to surrender!
- Telegraph Marshal Schukov.

1110
01:53:39,748 --> 01:53:42,342
Marshal Schukov? - What's going on?
- This is crazy!

1111
01:53:42,788 --> 01:53:44,903
We must surrender to the Russians!
- I'll shoot you!

1112
01:53:45,347 --> 01:53:47,815
The Führer forbade
any kind of surrender!

1113
01:54:06,303 --> 01:54:09,772
How long does it last?
- About 4 hours.

1114
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:46,807
Alright, children.

1115
01:54:47,254 --> 01:54:48,323
Dr. Stumpfegger

1116
01:54:48,774 --> 01:54:51,082
has brought the medicine
I told you about. - It's bitter,

1117
01:54:51,533 --> 01:54:53,091
but it's good for you.

1118
01:54:54,413 --> 01:54:55,732
Everyone gets a sip.

1119
01:54:57,412 --> 01:54:59,289
Who's first?

1120
01:55:02,051 --> 01:55:04,087
Heide, you're always so brave.

1121
01:55:10,969 --> 01:55:12,448
One more sip.

1122
01:55:15,608 --> 01:55:16,597
It wasn't that bad.

1123
01:55:22,607 --> 01:55:25,040
Good... Helmut?

1124
01:55:27,486 --> 01:55:28,441
Good.

1125
01:55:28,886 --> 01:55:31,718
It will keep you from getting sick
in this damp bunker.

1126
01:55:32,165 --> 01:55:34,473
But it isn't damp here.

1127
01:55:39,124 --> 01:55:40,602
Good, good.

1128
01:55:49,761 --> 01:55:50,910
Helga...

1129
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:55,028
I don't want any.

1130
01:55:55,480 --> 01:56:00,314
Do you want to get sick?
- Please, Mama. I don't want to.

1131
01:56:04,838 --> 01:56:07,636
Don't cry.
It won't help if you cry.

1132
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:10,796
You have to drink it.

1133
01:56:13,916 --> 01:56:14,632
Helga!

1134
01:56:18,835 --> 01:56:23,271
Come on! Open your mouth!

1135
01:56:24,114 --> 01:56:25,069
Papa!

1136
01:56:25,994 --> 01:56:26,949
Now!

1137
01:56:28,433 --> 01:56:29,627
Drink. Drink!

1138
01:56:43,390 --> 01:56:45,267
Sleep tight, children.

1139
01:56:55,188 --> 01:56:58,224
One day the lies will vanish,

1140
01:56:58,667 --> 01:57:01,261
and light will brighten the darkness.

1141
01:57:01,786 --> 01:57:04,380
Would you read it to me, please?

1142
01:57:04,986 --> 01:57:06,782
"One day the lies will vanish,

1143
01:57:07,225 --> 01:57:09,420
and light
will brighten the darkness. "

1144
01:57:10,505 --> 01:57:11,380
Let's do it again.

1145
01:57:11,904 --> 01:57:15,135
One day the lies will vanish,
and above them...

1146
01:57:16,143 --> 01:57:18,657
truth will triumph once again.

1147
01:57:19,223 --> 01:57:22,532
It will be the moment
when we stand above everything,

1148
01:57:23,142 --> 01:57:24,700
pure and...

1149
01:57:28,501 --> 01:57:29,980
unblemished.

1150
02:01:26,812 --> 02:01:30,201
We don't stand a chance.
- I don't care. I want out.

1151
02:01:30,651 --> 02:01:32,163
How do we cross the Russian lines?

1152
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:34,566
I won't stay a minute longer.

1153
02:01:35,010 --> 02:01:38,479
We're gonna die!
- Stop it! It won't be so bad.

1154
02:01:38,929 --> 02:01:40,647
The Russians will get us if we stay.

1155
02:01:44,248 --> 02:01:47,284
Good luck.
- Okay, let's go.

1156
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:19,221
On 30 April 1945,
the Führer committed suicide.

1157
02:03:19,788 --> 02:03:24,702
Thus he abandoned all those
who had pledged allegiance to him.

1158
02:03:25,147 --> 02:03:29,936
German soldiers, you obeyed
the Führer's orders and were prepared

1159
02:03:30,706 --> 02:03:34,175
to continue the battle for Berlin,
although

1160
02:03:34,625 --> 02:03:36,377
you were running out of ammunition

1161
02:03:36,825 --> 02:03:40,533
and further resistance was futile.

1162
02:03:42,144 --> 02:03:45,852
I order an immediate ceasefire.

1163
02:03:47,182 --> 02:03:51,141
Every further hour of battle
will only prolong

1164
02:03:51,582 --> 02:03:53,617
the civilians' terrible suffering

1165
02:03:54,061 --> 02:03:56,416
and the suffering of our wounded.

1166
02:03:56,860 --> 02:03:59,977
In agreement with the
Soviet Army Supreme Command,

1167
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:02,816
I order you

1168
02:04:03,259 --> 02:04:06,375
to cease fighting at once!

1169
02:04:06,818 --> 02:04:10,493
Weidling, former Commanding Officer

1170
02:04:10,938 --> 02:04:14,009
of the Berlin Defense Force.

1171
02:04:15,697 --> 02:04:17,448
A glass of water, please.

1172
02:05:20,723 --> 02:05:22,042
I need you no longer.

1173
02:05:26,202 --> 02:05:27,430
The dice is cast.

1174
02:06:33,348 --> 02:06:36,498
It's time, Doctor.
- You see how busy we are.

1175
02:06:36,947 --> 02:06:38,460
I insist that you accompany us.

1176
02:06:40,866 --> 02:06:42,458
So that's it.

1177
02:06:49,545 --> 02:06:53,776
Go on. You've done a great deal.
Thank you.

1178
02:07:01,422 --> 02:07:02,855
Schädle, come with me.

1179
02:07:03,462 --> 02:07:06,692
Sorry, I'm not going anywhere.

1180
02:07:08,661 --> 02:07:10,173
Let's go!

1181
02:08:25,525 --> 02:08:31,235
Sturmmann Krüger gets the Iron Cross,
2nd class, for defending Wolf Bridge.

1182
02:08:31,684 --> 02:08:33,639
Sturmmann Wagner
took out 2 machine gun posts

1183
02:08:34,083 --> 02:08:36,278
and defended Puttkammer Strasse.

1184
02:08:36,723 --> 02:08:39,475
He gets the Iron Cross,
2nd class.

1185
02:08:40,322 --> 02:08:42,312
Sturmmann Rauch gets the Iron Cross,
2nd class,

1186
02:08:42,761 --> 02:08:46,548
for helping messengers
get through enemy lines.

1187
02:09:16,674 --> 02:09:17,584
The others!

1188
02:09:22,673 --> 02:09:24,026
Oh God!

1189
02:09:25,432 --> 02:09:26,387
Duck, Müller!

1190
02:09:27,072 --> 02:09:28,471
Get outta here! Hurry!

1191
02:09:32,871 --> 02:09:34,543
Help!

1192
02:09:45,548 --> 02:09:46,503
Who goes there?

1193
02:09:54,426 --> 02:09:55,745
A German.

1194
02:10:01,385 --> 02:10:03,103
Herr Hewel?

1195
02:10:04,584 --> 02:10:07,462
Hewel,
thank God you're alive.

1196
02:10:10,383 --> 02:10:12,533
Where are the others?

1197
02:10:14,822 --> 02:10:18,450
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere... perhaps.

1198
02:10:18,901 --> 02:10:21,369
I'm sure most of the people
in my group are dead.

1199
02:10:22,661 --> 02:10:24,855
I never should have left the bunker.

1200
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:27,895
I should have shot myself.

1201
02:10:29,459 --> 02:10:30,574
But I couldn't.

1202
02:10:31,939 --> 02:10:35,055
Eat something.
There's time enough to die.

1203
02:11:22,968 --> 02:11:23,923
Attention!

1204
02:11:30,367 --> 02:11:32,561
Stay with the women.

1205
02:11:33,446 --> 02:11:34,765
Come here.

1206
02:11:46,803 --> 02:11:48,282
The Russians have surrounded us.

1207
02:11:48,883 --> 02:11:49,997
What will we do?

1208
02:11:51,042 --> 02:11:53,317
You can try to get through.

1209
02:11:54,202 --> 02:11:55,759
I'm not taking another step.

1210
02:11:56,881 --> 02:12:00,759
Think it over.
The Russians are only after us.

1211
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:03,358
As women, you have a chance.

1212
02:12:04,759 --> 02:12:06,158
Give it a try.

1213
02:12:07,599 --> 02:12:08,952
Good luck.

1214
02:12:11,878 --> 02:12:15,108
When you go past the Russians,
don't look anybody in the eye.

1215
02:12:16,317 --> 02:12:17,591
Don't forget.

1216
02:12:18,397 --> 02:12:19,715
Good luck.

1217
02:12:28,155 --> 02:12:29,667
The Russians!

1218
02:12:41,512 --> 02:12:42,467
Let's go.

1219
02:12:42,912 --> 02:12:45,709
Go ahead... I can't go on.

1220
02:12:46,151 --> 02:12:46,867
Please.

1221
02:12:49,830 --> 02:12:51,388
I have to try.

1222
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:54,738
Don't be angry with me.

1223
02:12:57,868 --> 02:12:59,062
I'll manage.

1224
02:13:12,065 --> 02:13:13,384
Doctor!

1225
02:13:13,825 --> 02:13:18,659
My comrades want to surrender
to the Russians. May I join you?

1226
02:13:19,104 --> 02:13:22,493
The Führer is dead.
You want to fight the war alone?

1227
02:13:22,943 --> 02:13:24,376
I feel committed to my oath.

1228
02:13:25,183 --> 02:13:28,094
Then talk to the Brigadeführer.

1229
02:13:56,816 --> 02:13:59,774
The Russians are clearing the area.
- Yes? - No resistance.

1230
02:14:00,216 --> 02:14:03,093
No shots have been fired.
- They'll be here in an hour.

1231
02:14:04,975 --> 02:14:09,445
What should we do? - Our honor
won't allow us to surrender!

1232
02:14:09,894 --> 02:14:11,565
What does that mean?

1233
02:14:12,013 --> 02:14:15,084
When the Russians come,
we fire until we're out of bullets.

1234
02:14:15,532 --> 02:14:17,284
Then we blow our brains out.

1235
02:14:17,732 --> 02:14:21,167
Rubbish! Is this murderous,
suicidal killing for the sake

1236
02:14:21,611 --> 02:14:24,171
of prestige the only way out?

1237
02:14:24,610 --> 02:14:27,761
We're SS officers.
We can't outlive the Führer's death!

1238
02:14:28,890 --> 02:14:30,083
Who else feels that way?

1239
02:16:14,188 --> 02:16:17,623
Want to sit with me a moment?
- I'd love to.

1240
02:16:22,906 --> 02:16:24,385
Why do you want to go on living?

1241
02:16:25,146 --> 02:16:28,182
And why do you want to die?

1242
02:16:29,745 --> 02:16:30,620
See this?

1243
02:16:32,184 --> 02:16:34,823
The Führer himself gave it to me.

1244
02:16:35,623 --> 02:16:37,022
A final decoration?

1245
02:16:38,063 --> 02:16:41,259
Perhaps. Hitler gave it to me
at his farewell.

1246
02:16:42,462 --> 02:16:43,861
He made me swear a vow.

1247
02:16:44,302 --> 02:16:49,170
That I would kill myself
the moment the Russians captured me.

1248
02:16:50,900 --> 02:16:53,050
Hitler made you promise
to kill yourself?

1249
02:16:54,339 --> 02:16:55,328
But why?

1250
02:16:55,779 --> 02:17:00,772
He probably didn't want me to be
forced to speak negatively of him.

1251
02:17:01,218 --> 02:17:05,130
But as a diplomat, you are protected
by international law.

1252
02:17:05,977 --> 02:17:08,809
Who will benefit
if you keep your promise?

1253
02:17:09,776 --> 02:17:10,811
They're here!

1254
02:17:23,973 --> 02:17:25,565
Don't shoot, comrades!

1255
02:17:29,252 --> 02:17:30,480
We have surrendered.

1256
02:17:31,932 --> 02:17:33,410
The war is over.

1257
02:17:34,931 --> 02:17:35,841
It's over.

1258
02:19:06,392 --> 02:19:10,145
Germany officially surrendered
on May 7, 1945.

1259
02:19:11,511 --> 02:19:15,059
It was agreed that all hostilities end
at midnight, May 8.

1260
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:20,501
By then,
the war had cost over 50 million lives.

1261
02:19:21,469 --> 02:19:27,100
6 million Jews had been murdered
in German concentration camps.

1262
02:19:27,748 --> 02:19:31,706
GERDA CHRISTIAN was able to escape
and avoided imprisonment.

1263
02:19:31,867 --> 02:19:35,905
She died in Düsseldorf on April 14, 1997.

1264
02:19:36,266 --> 02:19:40,224
PROF. DR. ERNST-GÜNTHER SCHENK was
released from Soviet captivity in 1953.

1265
02:19:40,305 --> 02:19:44,217

1271
02:20:08,619 --> 02:20:12,577
OTTO GÜNSCHE was captured by the Soviets
and was released from Bautzen prison

1272
02:20:12,778 --> 02:20:16,134
in East Germany in May 1956.
He died in Lohmar, near Bonn, in 2003.

1273
02:20:17,177 --> 02:20:20,613

survived the war and went on

1274
02:20:20,857 --> 02:20:24,166
to set many world flying records.

02:20:41,972 --> 02:20:45,362
vanished without a trace in Berlin,
during her escape.

1282
02:20:46,491 --> 02:20:48,925
ALBERT SPEER
was arrested in Flensburg in 1945.

1283
02:20:49,131 --> 02:20:52,088
He was sentenced 20 years at the Nuremberg
Trial and was released in 1966.

1284
02:20:52,290 --> 02:20:55,168
He died in London in 1981.

1285

GENERALS KEITEL and JODL

1286
02:20:58,329 --> 02:21:02,003
were sentenced to death
at the Nuremberg Trial and executed.

1287
02:21:03,248 --> 02:21:05,681
HERMANN GÖRING
was sentenced to death

1288
02:21:05,887 --> 02:21:08,959
but committed suicide in prison
before the execution was carried out.

1289
02:21:09,887 --> 02:21:12,844
HEINRICH HIMMLER
tried to escape under a false identity

1290
02:21:13,086 --> 02:21:17,556
with other fleeing refugees. After being
exposed and captured, he committed suicide.

1291
02:21:18,365 --> 02:21:21,322
MARTIN BORMANN and DR. LUDWIG STUMPFEGGER
committed suicide

1292
02:21:21,564 --> 02:21:26,114
close to Lehrtertrain station
on the morning of May 2, 1945.

1293
02:21:27,363 --> 02:21:29,319
ROCHUS MISCH

1294
02:21:29,483 --> 02:21:33,441
was released from Soviet captivity

1295
02:21:34,361 --> 02:21:36,317
TRAUDL JUNGE was classified by
the Western Allies as a "young follower".

1296
02:21:36,521 --> 02:21:38,477
She continued to work as a secretary
for various companies and lived in Munich

1297
02:21:38,561 --> 02:21:40,516
until her death in 2002.

1298
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:45,667
Of course, the terrible things
I heard from the Nuremberg Trials

1299
02:21:46,119 --> 02:21:52,114
about the 6 million Jews
and the people of other races

1300
02:21:52,558 --> 02:21:58,552
who were killed were facts
that shocked me deeply.

1301
02:21:59,516 --> 02:22:03,986
But I wasn't able to see
the connection with my own past.

1302
02:22:04,435 --> 02:22:08,712
I was satisfied
that I wasn't personally to blame

1303
02:22:09,154 --> 02:22:11,987
and that I hadn't known
about those things.

1304
02:22:12,434 --> 02:22:14,708
I wasn't aware of the extent.

1305
02:22:15,153 --> 02:22:20,909
But one day I went past
the memorial plaque

1306
02:22:21,792 --> 02:22:25,466
which had been put up for
Sophie Scholl in Franz Josef Strasse,

1307
02:22:25,911 --> 02:22:28,947
and I saw that she was born
the same year as me,

1308
02:22:29,390 --> 02:22:34,224
and she was executed the same year
I started working for Hitler.

1309
02:22:35,429 --> 02:22:39,740
And at that moment
I actually sensed

1310
02:22:40,188 --> 02:22:43,896
that it was no excuse to be young,

1311
02:22:44,347 --> 02:22:49,295
and that it would have been possible
to find things out.
