1
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:48,514
It all began so nice.

2
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:57,098
A bunch of friends at a cabin
in the mountains.

3
00:00:57,264 --> 00:01:01,598
Lots of alcohol, laughter.
We had fun.

4
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:06,181
And then don't you fucking know it,
a squad of nazi zombies woke up.

5
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:13,348
I know.
It sounds like a cliché,

6
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:16,139
but that's what happened.

7
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:20,848
You see, we found something.

8
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:24,681
Something we shouldn't have found.

9
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:29,806
Old Nazi gold.

10
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:33,014
And then ...

11
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:36,306
All hell broke loose.

12
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:51,181
They slaughtered us.
One .....

13
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:59,639
.... by one.
One of them bit me.

14
00:02:00,723 --> 00:02:04,056
But I knew how I could fix it.

15
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:13,098
My girlfriend Hanna ....

16
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:18,306
They ....

17
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,348
They got her too.

18
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:26,306
I got the gold.

19
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,598
Gave it back.

20
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,889
And they let me go.

21
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,431
I thought I was safe.

22
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:13,014
I was wrong.

23
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:09,973
Take the damn coin and go back
to hell where you came from!

24
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:19,973
Shit, shit, shit.

25
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:27,764
Okay, okay.

27
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:27,306
I knew we should not
have touched the box.

28
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,681
Stay awake now.
Stay awake.

29
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,473
That's a good question, Toralf.
Of all migratory birds

30
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,348
there's a little critter
that really stands out.

31
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:57,264
Namely, Arctic Terns,
or Sterna Paradisaea,

32
00:06:57,431 --> 00:07:01,014
a coastal bound,
surface-feeding seabird

33
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:03,806
from the group "Havterner".

34
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,098
Havternen maneuvers gracefully
in the air like a ....

35
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:29,139
Troops, Sieg Heil!

37
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:33,473
Yes?

38
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:44,473
What do we have here?

39
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,931
Martin, can you hear me?

40
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:50,973
Hello, Martin.
Welcome back.

41
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,306
Martin, you crashed your car.

42
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:58,473
A nasty crash.
You are lucky to be alive.

43
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,056
That is more than one can say
about your friends.

44
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:06,723
Have you seen ....

45
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:12,556
Have you seen the creatures?

46
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:16,681
The things.....

47
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:21,848
Have the police caught them?
Or the army?

48
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,889
Roy and Erlend?

49
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:31,764
- Hanna?
- We found our friends. All of them.

50
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:35,931
Dead.
Hanna was your girlfriend, right?

51
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:39,514
Very beautiful.
We found her too.

52
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,973
With an ax driven into the neck.

53
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:45,723
And your fingerprints on the shaft.

54
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:49,681
Do you have any idea
how that could happen?

55
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:52,514
They came up from ....

56
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,389
From the snow. Creatures. Nazis.
We got away, but ....

57
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:02,056
Nazis coming out of the ground?
Absurd.

58
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:06,848
Are you sure that he doesn't
have brain damage as well?

59
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:12,889
Please call the family and tell them that he
has awakened, and ask the D.A. to send a car.

60
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:16,348
And four additional men. It looks like
you are ready to be transported.

61
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:21,014
They are still out there. They will kill
again if we do not stop them.

62
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:25,514
We are not going to stop anyone.
I've seen what you've done.

63
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:30,931
I was up there, and the only place you are going
is to jail. No one knows what happened up there.

64
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,973
Only you know that.
And it's not only bad news.

65
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:40,639
When we found you, you were badly injured.
Your right arm was torn straight off.

66
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,973
- It was not torn ....
- When we found you, it was cold.

67
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:48,556
The snow had chilled all,
and that was very good.

68
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:52,723
- And then we found your arm in the car.
- In the car?

69
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,598
It was slightly bruised and quite
pale for some strange reason,

70
00:10:57,764 --> 00:11:00,139
but the surgery was a success.

71
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:03,348
We managed to re-attach your arm.

72
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:18,681
No, no, no.

73
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:26,681
- It's not my arm.
- Relax.

74
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:30,723
It is Satan's arm!
It is Satan's arm!

75
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,306
Calm down.

76
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:42,473
No, it's not me!

77
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:50,056
No!

78
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:58,431
It's not me!
What the hell ...?

79
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,098
Stop!

80
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,181
Randi?

81
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:04,181
Be prepared to remove your
dentures a bit later ...

82
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:07,473
I'm ready for a little head tonight.

83
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:47,014
From the one that got away.

84
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:50,264
Nameless German Soldiers
Who Fell In World War II

85
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,598
Broken.

86
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,556
Warm.

87
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:51,014
The men have rotted.

88
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:56,681
We need more people.

89
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:12,806
Damn lock!

90
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:29,931
You scared me, Nils.

91
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,973
I can't take any more of your nonsense.
I've had a hell of a long day.

92
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:40,098
A wedding, a funeral
and a confirmation.

93
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:43,931
The one confirmant was damn fine.

94
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:46,639
If only I had been ten years younger ...

95
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,848
And not a priest, of course.

96
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,014
Nils?

97
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,056
Come on!

98
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,098
Sieg ....

99
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,431
Heil.

100
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:52,723
Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil.

101
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,473
They came down from the mountain.

102
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:14,431
I saw them.

103
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,223
Hey! Hey!

104
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:42,181
They are coming!
They're going to kill everyone!

105
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:51,389
Psst, hey.
Hey, you, psst. Yeah, you.

106
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,348
Hello.

107
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:59,598
I saw your arm.
Looks really cool.

108
00:19:59,764 --> 00:20:04,348
Took some pictures too.
Looks sick, but still cool.

109
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:10,431
I am not supposed to be in here,
but I snuck in here like a ninja.

110
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:16,931
Oh, I am Bobby.
I am here on vacation with my mom.

111
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,098
She ate some bad fish yesterday,
so ... yeah ..

112
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:24,348
Cool.
Seriously cool.

113
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:27,806
It looks burned.
And old.

114
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:31,514
Like a zombie arm.
Zombies are cool.

115
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,431
Zombies?

116
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:39,223
Oh, sorry, got to take this. They are
wondering if I can get some more info.

117
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:42,473
More than just a picture of the arm.

118
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:44,889
Who? What?

119
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:47,806
The Zombie Squad. They are wondering
if I can get some more info.

120
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:50,473
They are experts on zombies.
They live in America.

121
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:54,056
They have trained for this for years,
just waiting for a zombie outbreak to happen.

122
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:58,473
So they can come here? Just tell them
to come right now to get the zombies.

123
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,806
If they are experts they can kill
the zombies for us!

124
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,639
I know. You've seen the zombies?
'Cause they're real, right? Yeah!

125
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:08,473
- Can you let me loose?
- I'm not sure if I should, I mean, you're ..

126
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:14,598
- I have chocolate.
- You do?

127
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:21,014
Yeah, I have chocolate. 'Cause I could
get it for you, but you know ...

128
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:24,848
- Double-triple-fudge.
- Oh my God ...!

129
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:27,139
Let me get this right here.

130
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:33,306
Come on.
You can do it.

131
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:36,431
Help me with the other.

132
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:46,014
- Can I have my chocolate now?
- There is no chocolate, kid.

133
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,139
- No chocolate?
- Shut the fuck up.

134
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:55,806
I got to get out.

135
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:08,764
Hey!

136
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:12,264
It's not what it looks like.

137
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:17,431
Stop!

139
00:24:11,223 --> 00:24:12,639
Hello?

140
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:17,223
This is Daniel Heffernan, leader of the
Zombie Squad. Can I please speak to Bobby?

141
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,473
Bobby, uhh ...

142
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:23,889
- Bobby, he ...
- I don't speak the language of Thor.

143
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:27,431
- Is Bobby there?
- Bobby was killed by zombies.

144
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,306
My God.

145
00:24:30,598 --> 00:24:35,056
Is this Zombie Squad? That is a 10.4, Martin,
and we will be heading your way shortly.

146
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:40,348
But before we go we need as much information
as you can give us. Anything you have.

147
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:42,556
Well, umm .....

148
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:49,014
We came up to the cabin,
and there was a bunch of ... of ..

149
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:53,014
Nazi zombies there and ...

150
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:56,139
You know, they killed us all, and ..

151
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:59,139
Except me. Yeah, and ...

152
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:02,931
I had to saw my arm off and that, but ..

153
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:05,973
It's ... yeah, the arm is ... and ..

154
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:09,181
But then they wanted the
treasure and the coin and ...

155
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:12,139
- Were any of you bitten?
- We were all bitten,

156
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:16,931
But we didn't become one of them.
We just ....

157
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:21,848
We just died, so ...

158
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:26,806
Listen, Martin, and listen good.

159
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:29,598
These are not your classic
textbook zombies,

160
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:35,306
just hungering to feast on the flesh of man.
No, these are most likely cursed zombies.

161
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:38,389
Awakened to reclaim something that
was stolen from them,

162
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:43,223
- or to complete a task given to them.
- They called him Herzog, they ...

163
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:47,723
They called him Herzog.

164
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:51,389
Martin of the North,
we will be on our way shortly,

165
00:25:51,556 --> 00:25:54,598
and we will take care of
this infection.

166
00:25:54,764 --> 00:25:57,931
We are professionals.
But until then,

167
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:02,848
find out what they seek,
their purpose. Bye.

168
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:12,223
Zombie Squad, they are ....

169
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:14,806
They are professionals.

170
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:19,514
They are bad ass.

171
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,681
Okay, girls.

172
00:26:21,848 --> 00:26:24,931
It looks like we're going to Norway.

173
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:34,639
Norway? We can't go to Norway.
That's on the other side of the world.

174
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:40,723
Yeah, and how do we know it's for real? I mean, Daniel,
that is a long way to go to find out if it's a hoax?

175
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:42,764
You saw the picture.

176
00:26:42,931 --> 00:26:46,098
This is a bonafide infected arm.
You know this.

177
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:50,389
All the signs are there, guys. The decayed
skin, the rotten hair, the dark blood.

178
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:53,306
- This is real, guys, it's real.
- This could be dangerous.

179
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:57,723
No shit, it's fucking zombies.
Of course it will be dangerous!

180
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:03,223
But this is what we've been waiting for. This is our
chance  to prove to everyone that we were right.

181
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:08,431
I mean, we've been telling everyone for
years that it is just a matter of time

182
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:12,764
before the first outbreak happens.
And what have we seen in return?

183
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,931
Laughter. Ridicule.

184
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:20,264
Wedgies.

185
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:24,723
Well, guess who was right?

186
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:29,598
- Guess who's laughing now?
- I guess we're laughing now?

187
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:34,431
You're damn right we are. I mean, what did we start
the Zombie Squad for if it wasn't for this?

188
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,681
- He's right.
- Damn right I'm right.

189
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:42,181
And besides, if we don't do this...
If we don't go there and help these people...

190
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:44,723
Who the hell will?
Yeah ....

191
00:27:47,973 --> 00:27:50,431
- So what do we do?
- Yes!

192
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:54,473
Okay, we need as much information as we
can get on this Herzog character,

193
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,306
on Martin and north of Norway, everything.

194
00:27:57,473 --> 00:28:00,973
Oh wait, hold on, guys.
We can't let our landlords know about this.

195
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:04,098
- Do you mean our parents?
- Yes, our parents, but ...

196
00:28:04,264 --> 00:28:07,514
- We just can't tell them what's happening.
- Got it.

197
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:10,848
Alright, official members of the
Zombie Squad USA....

198
00:28:11,014 --> 00:28:14,306
- Oh my God ...!
- It's time to go hunting.

199
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:21,139
That was further than usual.

200
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:55,014
I poured you some coffee.

201
00:28:56,973 --> 00:29:00,598
- Damn, it is cold.
- It's because you're 40 minutes late.

202
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:04,973
I am on winter time.
That winter time, summer time system ..

203
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:09,514
It's so stupid.
What do you have?

204
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,223
Not much. Petra's boy has been
shoplifting again.

205
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:18,098
They should have done what they do in Iran.
Cut off his hands. Taught him a lesson.

206
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:21,806
And Ove's dog has pooped
in Mr. Olsen's garden.

207
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:23,723
- Shoot him.
- Shoot Mr. Olsen?

208
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:26,639
Not shoot Mr. Olsen.
You shoot the dog!

209
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:31,431
In addition we have a lecture in school
about the danger of using marijuana.

210
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:33,056
Boring ....

211
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:37,889
There was one thing, though.
From Oksfjord.

212
00:29:38,764 --> 00:29:41,806
Oksfjord? No, no, no, it is
not our jurisdiction.

213
00:29:41,973 --> 00:29:46,514
Martin Hykkerud escaped from the
hospital yesterday.

214
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:51,431
Martin Hykkerud? The same Martin Hykkerud who
killed his friends on top of the mountain?

215
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:56,806
Yeah. He escaped from the hospital yesterday
and killed a little boy and a policeman ...

216
00:29:56,973 --> 00:30:00,681
by throwing a Mercedes star at his face.

217
00:30:00,848 --> 00:30:03,556
- He cut off the Mercedes star?
- Yeah.

218
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:07,639
- What does Oslo say?
- About the Mercedes star?

219
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,973
About the Hykkerud case!

220
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:14,348
They say we all need to be on alert,
and that we need to get more people.

221
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:17,056
Hold the fort until they can send a team.

222
00:30:17,223 --> 00:30:20,723
Send a team, more people ... Where the hell
do I find the money to bring in more people?

223
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:25,514
I don't even have money to buy new
batteries for the cars out here.

224
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:27,514
Okay. Right.

225
00:30:30,514 --> 00:30:32,264
What?

226
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:36,723
Didn't we agree on a more
casual style here?

227
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:44,514
Continue.

228
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:54,639
My God, I was expecting something like the
Hoth system, but this is more like Endor.

229
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:57,764
Can't you reference anything
other than Star Wars?

230
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:03,223
- Like Star Trek maybe if I can't sleep.
- Yeah, at least it is based on scientific theories ...

231
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:06,139
- Guys, guys, I have a lock on Martin.
- Where is he?

232
00:31:06,306 --> 00:31:08,848
- Ice Bay.
- Ok, let's go!

233
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:13,348
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
First there is something we need to do.

234
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:16,973
- Oh yeah, I really have to pee.
- No!

235
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:21,264
Arm up!
You really fucking ruined that.

236
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:19,848
It would be a lot easier if  we
could buy  weapons here. I know.

237
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:23,014
What the fuck's the matter with
this country?

239
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:12,931
Can I help you?

240
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:16,306
Too much coffee.
You just go ahead.

241
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:19,223
Best for you if you move on.

242
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,389
This is a war museum, huh?

243
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:40,723
Yes.

244
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,598
Yes, and ....

245
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:48,473
Do you have any information
about the Germans?

246
00:34:55,764 --> 00:34:57,223
Help!

247
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,639
Listen to me!

248
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:07,889
I don't have time for this now. They're coming,
and we must stop them! Do you understand.

249
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:11,681
I have two kittens at home.
Please  don't hurt me. Shut up!

250
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:16,639
Just help me.
Please.

251
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:20,764
- Do you have information about Einsatz?
- Yes.

252
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:24,348
- First floor.
- First floor.

253
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:37,848
Where the hell are you?

254
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,348
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

255
00:35:50,473 --> 00:35:53,264
Hitler's buddy.

256
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:57,681
- Nice, huh?
- Do not touch the exhibit.

257
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:02,848
Herzog was made commander of
Einsatz in 1942,

258
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:06,973
and was sent to the far north of Norway,
in order to protect the warships

259
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:10,681
that the German Navy was hiding
in the fjords.

260
00:36:10,848 --> 00:36:17,806
He was on duty in Oksfjord doing a routine
inspection on the ship Scharnholst, when ...

261
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:19,556
Scharnholst.

262
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:26,973
When Tirpitz, the German
fleet's biggest warship

263
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:30,889
was attacked by English bombers in Talvik,

264
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:36,223
after getting vital information on the
ships location from Norwegian spies.

265
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:40,264
Hitler, humiliated by the attack on
Tirpitz ordered Herzog

266
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:46,431
to wipe out all of the 800 men, and people
who lived in Talvik at the time.

267
00:36:49,098 --> 00:36:52,223
He was on his way?

268
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:58,598
He was on his way to Talvik the evening him
and his men were slaughtered in Oksfjord?

269
00:36:58,764 --> 00:37:01,681
On a mission from Hitler.

270
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:11,556
A mission that was never completed.
That is what it is. That's exactly what it is.

271
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:15,723
They will destroy Talvik.

272
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:19,473
Where .....?

273
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:27,889
Herzog was going from Oksfjord,

274
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:30,264
which is here.

275
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:33,473
And he was going to Talvik.

276
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:36,014
It's here.

277
00:37:36,181 --> 00:37:38,056
Where are we now?

278
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,723
Where are we now?!

279
00:37:43,306 --> 00:37:44,681
Here.

280
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,639
Ice Bay.

281
00:37:51,473 --> 00:37:55,056
It is right between ....

283
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:42,014
They are recruiting!

284
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:47,306
They make new soldiers.
Can they do that now? Fuck!

285
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:50,556
Okay, they're coming here.
They're coming here.

286
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:55,431
I will not die in a museum with
a guy in a green jogging suit.

287
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:58,223
Calm down.
You will die.

288
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:02,264
But relax.
Not today.

289
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:56,014
There!

290
00:41:58,264 --> 00:42:00,723
Let's see what this thing can do.

291
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,723
What kind of thing?

292
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:33,598
What did you do?
You just killed them without ...

293
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:36,556
It's the arm, man.

294
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:41,556
Before I could not control it,
but now it does what I think.

295
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:44,223
You're not even sweating.

296
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:46,973
Don't worry about it.

297
00:42:51,973 --> 00:42:56,723
They will increase in numbers.
Damn, they will be many.

298
00:42:56,889 --> 00:42:59,806
There are too many for this arm.

299
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,056
So much death.

300
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:33,223
All this unnecessary death.

302
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:04,889
Fuck!

303
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:08,889
You did what the fucker
did before. You just ...

304
00:44:09,056 --> 00:44:12,306
- You ...
- No, it was the arm. It was the arm.

305
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:42,681
He doesn't attack.

306
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:56,389
Did you see that? Did you see that?
I hit it!

307
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:59,848
I hit it! Oh my God.
I did it. I fucking did it!

308
00:45:00,014 --> 00:45:02,681
I hit it right in the eye.
Oh my God, oh my God.

309
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:06,348
Take a picture.
Please take a picture of me.

310
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:09,556
- First Zombie Squad kill.
- One, two ....

311
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:11,681
Cheese ...!

312
00:45:12,473 --> 00:45:14,681
Did you get it?

313
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:19,639
Oh, we spoke on the phone. I am Daniel.
This is Blake and Monica.

314
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:22,306
We are the Zombie Squad.

315
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:27,973
- God damn it.
- It is real. These are real dead people.

316
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:30,973
And that's a real zombie.
You killed him.

317
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:34,889
- I can't believe it.
- Can we just focus for one second, guys?

318
00:45:35,056 --> 00:45:39,264
I'm so sorry.
We are more professional than this.

319
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:42,431
- You're the Zombie Squad?
- Yep.

320
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:45,014
- You are the Zombie Squad.
- Yeah, we are the Zombie Squad.

321
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:49,223
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I was just expecting something different.

322
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:53,598
So was this guy when he woke
up this morning.

323
00:45:55,848 --> 00:45:58,306
'Cause I hit him in the face
with an ax.

324
00:45:58,473 --> 00:46:01,889
- Yeah, how did you find me?
- We tracked your iPhone, of course.

325
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:05,639
We're fucking nerds. It's what we do.
Technical shit. Let's cut the chit chat.

326
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:10,014
What did you find out?
What do the creatures want?

327
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:17,181
Revenge.

329
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:21,764
This is insane!

330
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:26,098
You?
You have the gift?

331
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:29,098
The force is strong with this one.

332
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:30,973
Ok.

333
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,389
Martin, this is how we defeat them.
This is how we take them down.

334
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,931
- What do you mean?
- I mean ...

335
00:47:44,223 --> 00:47:46,514
We create an army of our own.

336
00:47:47,306 --> 00:47:50,514
I tried to get as much information
as I could on my trip over.

337
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:54,348
Especially about Herzog. To defeat your
enemy, you must know your enemy.

338
00:47:54,514 --> 00:47:57,889
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
from the Soviet army.

339
00:47:58,056 --> 00:48:01,556
He and his battalion was captured
during the battle of Kursk,

340
00:48:01,723 --> 00:48:04,556
and brought here to the north of
Norway as POWs.

341
00:48:04,723 --> 00:48:08,223
In 44 they were all sent
to Kvenang mountain ..

342
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,806
..to build a road through
the mountain pass.

343
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:15,806
But it was after they built the road
that shit got ugly.

344
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:21,431
All of the prisoners were shot.
Shot to death!

345
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,431
No survivors.

346
00:48:24,598 --> 00:48:28,056
And the man in charge?

347
00:48:28,223 --> 00:48:29,973
Herzog.

348
00:48:30,556 --> 00:48:33,473
Those bodies are still buried there.

349
00:48:34,598 --> 00:48:39,306
Buried in the frozen soil.
Preserved, waiting...

350
00:48:42,264 --> 00:48:46,014
- Waiting for what?
- The same thing that drives Herzog.

351
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:50,681
Revenge.
And guess who is gonna give it to them.

352
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:56,723
- The man who can raise the dead?
- Fucking yeah ...!

353
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:01,681
You guys go after Herzog. Try to slow him down
and give us as much time as possible, ok?

354
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:04,556
- What if this doesn't work?
- It has to.

355
00:49:04,723 --> 00:49:08,056
All we have to do is to get to Kvenang mountain,
find Stavarin, wake him back from the dead,

356
00:49:08,223 --> 00:49:11,681
and bring him back to Talvik so he can
help us fight Herzog and his men.

357
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:15,139
Easy. Besides ......

358
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:19,514
We got help.

359
00:49:23,973 --> 00:49:26,806
Here we go.

360
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,973
He is our last hope.

361
00:49:52,264 --> 00:49:54,431
Look, a tank.

363
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:17,306
- A visit at this hour?
- That was early.

365
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:35,681
Hello?

367
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:46,514
Look.
His army is growing bigger.

368
00:51:48,181 --> 00:51:52,056
Glenn, are there any more towns or
villages before he reaches Talvik?

369
00:51:52,223 --> 00:51:57,014
- Maybe a few houses, but that's it.
- Good. So what he has now he will use for his attack.

370
00:51:57,181 --> 00:52:01,639
Yeah, pretty much. That is until he starts killing the
people of Talvik and makes them join him as well.

371
00:52:01,806 --> 00:52:05,056
- How many people live in Talvik?
- About 3000.

372
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:09,181
What, holy shit! All the more reason for
us to slow them down as much as we can.

373
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:16,098
Look. Do you know how to use one of those things?
Of course. I am from northern Norway, aren't I.

374
00:52:16,264 --> 00:52:19,806
I don't know what that means.
Guys, pack light.

375
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:22,514
We're moving out. Now!

376
00:52:27,723 --> 00:52:31,764
What the hell happened here?

377
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:34,681
What are the investigators saying?

378
00:52:34,848 --> 00:52:38,639
They are not investigators, is's only
Tom and Ole wearing white suits today.

379
00:52:38,806 --> 00:52:42,139
They thought it might make them
look more professional.

380
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:46,306
A forensic team with real investigators
should get here later tonight.

381
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:51,014
- Do we have any witnesses?
- Not unless you can make the seagulls talk.

382
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:54,639
Seagulls..... yes.
That would make a damn good invention.

383
00:52:54,806 --> 00:52:58,806
A gadget that translates
seagull language to human language.

384
00:52:58,973 --> 00:53:02,223
That inventor would get filthy rich.

385
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:05,639
Get the bodies to Talvik
before the seagulls eat them.

386
00:53:05,806 --> 00:53:10,931
And take lots of pictures, otherwise
Forensics will cut off my balls.

387
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:14,889
Boss, here are pictures
from the surveillance camera.

388
00:53:18,306 --> 00:53:20,431
Isn't that...?

389
00:53:24,723 --> 00:53:28,139
Lick me deep in my manpussy ....!

390
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:36,264
Okay, guys, guys!
We are in a hurry. Come on!

391
00:53:36,431 --> 00:53:39,056
Come on, damn it!
We have things to do!

392
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:44,681
There they are.
And they have a tank, I see.

393
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:47,639
Yeah, they stole it from the museum.

394
00:53:48,806 --> 00:53:50,223
Fuck!

395
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:56,014
- What is that?
- The largest tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

396
00:53:56,181 --> 00:53:58,931
No, no, no.
That. What is that?

397
00:53:59,098 --> 00:54:03,764
These are replicas of the binoculars that
Han and Chewie used on the planet Hoth.

398
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:08,014
Did you guys know fun fact?
All of the Hoth scenes

399
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:12,306
were filmed here in Norway.
This place called Finse.

400
00:54:12,473 --> 00:54:17,514
Girls, could we please maybe focus on,
you know, the Nazi zombies instead?

401
00:54:17,681 --> 00:54:22,181
What do we do? Well, Daniel told us to slow
them down, so that's what we're gonna do.

402
00:54:22,348 --> 00:54:24,139
Look.

403
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:29,514
We need to get out there, get their attention
and lure them into the swamps, right.

404
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:34,973
And then when they get stuck, we can use the fertilizer
bombs we made and blow them into bits and pieces.

405
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:37,389
That sounds basically impossible.

406
00:54:37,556 --> 00:54:41,306
And how are you planning on luring them
out there? We need bait. Live bait.

407
00:54:41,473 --> 00:54:44,931
Yes, we need someone to attract
their attention.

408
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:47,931
Someone who is light on their feet.

409
00:54:48,098 --> 00:54:52,848
Who knows these swamps and can move
through them without getting stuck.

410
00:54:59,181 --> 00:55:00,723
What?

411
00:55:00,889 --> 00:55:02,598
No.

412
00:55:02,764 --> 00:55:05,806
No. That's a swamp.
I'm not getting out there.

413
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:09,848
Who says I won't get stuck?
And one more thing ...

414
00:55:10,014 --> 00:55:13,139
Those things are fucking zombies
who want to rip my face off.

415
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:16,264
Talvik is you hometown, am I right?

416
00:55:16,431 --> 00:55:20,014
- Yeah.
- You must have people you love there.

417
00:55:20,181 --> 00:55:24,931
Yeah. Especially one ma ... woman,
that I love.

418
00:55:25,098 --> 00:55:31,014
- Long hair and big boobs.
- Do it for "her".

419
00:55:31,181 --> 00:55:35,514
You just bring them here,
and we'll do the rest. Capice?

420
00:55:44,181 --> 00:55:47,431
Hey man? Martin?

421
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:50,889
- Yeah?
- Are you okay?

422
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,806
Yeah, I ...

423
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:57,764
First, we wake up a battalion
of Nazi zombies,

424
00:55:57,931 --> 00:56:02,014
and now I'm supposed to wake up
a bunch of dead Russian guys.

425
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:05,014
Look, your arm, your power,

426
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:09,223
is the only thing that can take down
Herzog at this point. Remember that.

427
00:56:09,389 --> 00:56:11,473
If we don't succeed,

428
00:56:12,223 --> 00:56:16,431
his power will keep growing
until he's unstoppable.

429
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:22,098
That, my friend,
is a big bowl of shit

430
00:56:22,264 --> 00:56:25,181
that we don't want to live in.

431
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:37,973
Oh my God.
That is vile smelling.

432
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:41,014
How did it fill up the car so fast?
That smell ....!

433
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:46,056
- It's alright, he's just carsick or something.
- That smells foul.

434
00:56:46,223 --> 00:56:47,973
No, no, no no!

435
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,931
Fuck, that's disgusting!

436
00:56:53,931 --> 00:56:55,848
That smells.

437
00:57:39,181 --> 00:57:44,264
I didn't know it was an
ugly-nosed congress in town.

438
00:57:49,014 --> 00:57:50,639
Come and get me, then.

439
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:54,723
Come and get me if you dare.

440
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:17,223
Move!

441
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:23,598
Halt!

442
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:29,264
- It's working. They are following him.
- But not Herzog and most of his men. Shit.

443
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:35,473
No, no, it's ok. We got their attention. If we
take these guys out, he will come for us instead.

444
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,473
Come on, Glenn!

445
00:58:44,223 --> 00:58:46,681
Run faster!

446
00:59:08,931 --> 00:59:09,639
Yes!

447
00:59:17,098 --> 00:59:18,931
Come on, Glenn!

448
00:59:20,806 --> 00:59:22,848
Yes.

449
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:31,681
- Run, Glenn!
- Faster!

450
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:33,556
Run, run!

451
00:59:41,264 --> 00:59:43,139
Please, God.

452
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:51,348
Yes!

453
00:59:51,514 --> 00:59:54,264
Oh my God, Blake!

454
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:58,306
USA, USA!

455
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:00,514
USA!

456
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:04,764
Fire!

457
01:00:14,806 --> 01:00:18,264
Hey. The tank is moving.

458
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:23,306
That can't be good.

459
01:00:36,598 --> 01:00:38,431
Run!

460
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,848
Run!

461
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:55,431
Oh my God!

462
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:21,348
Talvik. Now.

463
01:02:15,389 --> 01:02:17,139
Hey.

464
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:22,264
- Where are we?
- We're getting close.

465
01:02:22,431 --> 01:02:24,639
But we're also stuck.

466
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:33,056
- Can I push it?
- I don't think that would help.

467
01:02:33,223 --> 01:02:37,681
- Is it far? We could walk.
- We don't have that kind of time.

468
01:02:40,348 --> 01:02:42,806
If only we could find something

469
01:02:42,973 --> 01:02:46,973
to put under the car, you know.
Something that would give us traction.

470
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,889
Then I could get us out of here.

472
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:43,848
- There you are.
- Damn hard to find room for all the bodies.

473
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:48,723
The cooler is completely full. We had to throw
the rest in the garage with some ice cubes.

474
01:03:48,889 --> 01:03:52,389
- Sounds like a perfect solution.
- Thank you.

475
01:03:53,389 --> 01:03:58,514
Mostly Germans and French. Hardly the vacation they
envisioned when they got their tickets for Norway.

476
01:03:58,681 --> 01:04:02,348
Having their heads and arms ripped off and
entrails pulled out? I doubt it.

477
01:04:02,514 --> 01:04:05,223
Unless they like that kind of kinky stuff.

478
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:13,473
- Should you do that?
- No.

479
01:04:13,639 --> 01:04:16,723
- Shouldn't Forensics have been here by now?
- It was so windy down in Alta

480
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:21,014
that the plane couldn't land. They said
they should be here tomorrow afternoon.

481
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:27,056
- It's perfect.
- What?

482
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,973
It's our chance.

483
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:34,931
Now, we can fucking show people
what we're made of here.

484
01:04:35,098 --> 01:04:39,806
Us here at Talvik Police will
find Martin Hykkerud ourselves.

485
01:04:39,973 --> 01:04:44,181
We will get him. Us.
We will be heroes.

486
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:48,306
Not the goddamn suit-cladded,

487
01:04:48,473 --> 01:04:51,889
Sushi-eating cocksuckers down south.

488
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:55,014
Beef the guys....

489
01:04:55,181 --> 01:05:00,348
Brief the guys. Send photos to all
the cops here in Talvik.

490
01:05:00,514 --> 01:05:05,223
If he as much as stops to pee, I want to
know the color and smell of his urine.

491
01:05:06,473 --> 01:05:09,389
- Odor and color.
- And get the weapons ready.

492
01:05:09,556 --> 01:05:13,056
For once we will shoot at something
other that seagulls.

493
01:05:18,223 --> 01:05:20,806
Do you really think this is
going to work?

494
01:05:20,973 --> 01:05:25,806
I mean, say we actually manage to wake
these Russians back to life.

495
01:05:25,973 --> 01:05:28,806
What's stopping them from killing us?

496
01:05:30,098 --> 01:05:34,806
I don't know what's gonna happen.
But judging based on him?

497
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:38,889
He treats you like you're his master.
So hopefully they do the same.

498
01:05:39,056 --> 01:05:41,014
Hopefully.

499
01:05:41,181 --> 01:05:45,139
Hopefully .... I don't know, man.
This is some unprecedented, unheard of,

500
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:50,348
mysterious voodoo zombie shit, man.
I've never seen this before.

501
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:55,848
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not in any of them.

502
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:59,806
You have created a whole
new genre here, man.

503
01:05:59,973 --> 01:06:04,306
Look, I mean, if we are gonna go up
against a battalion of Nazi zombies,

504
01:06:04,473 --> 01:06:08,306
we could do a whole lot worse than teaming
up with a battalion of Russian zombies.

505
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:14,806
He has to die, you know.
Herzog.

506
01:06:14,973 --> 01:06:18,598
For what he did.
We have to kill him.

507
01:06:20,181 --> 01:06:24,139
I have to kill him.
For Hanna.

508
01:06:27,514 --> 01:06:30,639
- This is it.
- Yeah.

509
01:06:32,473 --> 01:06:35,181
This is definitely it.

510
01:06:36,098 --> 01:06:40,848
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

511
01:06:41,014 --> 01:06:45,681
So they got be buried in
this frozen ground.

512
01:06:47,848 --> 01:06:49,931
How do we do this?

513
01:06:50,098 --> 01:06:51,848
You do it ...

514
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:54,764
just like you did .... with him.

515
01:06:54,931 --> 01:06:57,598
I put my hand on his head.

516
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,348
Okay. Right.

517
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:05,889
We can't dig up everyone.
It'll take weeks.

518
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:10,306
You have to wake them up,
one way or another.

519
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:36,973
Master!

520
01:09:42,348 --> 01:09:44,848
Fuck, yeah!

521
01:10:19,098 --> 01:10:21,348
He was first seen here.

522
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:24,764
In Oksfjord.

523
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:30,598
And next time here.
Museum at Ice Bay.

524
01:10:30,764 --> 01:10:35,181
Then he appears to be heading south.
Perhaps there.

525
01:10:37,181 --> 01:10:39,139
We have a problem.

526
01:10:39,973 --> 01:10:43,973
A gang dressed as Germans
going crazy out there?

527
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:47,181
Crazy?
They killed loads of people, so yeah.

528
01:10:47,348 --> 01:10:52,139
What's happening. We haven't had a murder since 74,
and suddenly we have Ragnarok on our doorstep.

529
01:10:52,306 --> 01:10:57,889
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shoot first, ask later!

530
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:46,639
There is no one here.
We have sent them away.

531
01:11:46,806 --> 01:11:49,014
They are gone.

532
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:54,514
Since you can't complete your mission,

533
01:11:54,681 --> 01:11:59,181
you might as well just turn
and go back to your snow cave.

534
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:31,098
Some have grown a bit since last time.
Gotten a little bigger.

535
01:12:34,931 --> 01:12:38,264
I brought a couple of buddies to
the dance.

536
01:13:24,098 --> 01:13:27,223
Don't you get a bitter feeling when
somebody you thought were dead

537
01:13:27,389 --> 01:13:30,264
have come back to kill you?

538
01:13:57,723 --> 01:13:59,681
Let's kill them.

539
01:13:59,848 --> 01:14:01,264
Troops!

540
01:14:04,514 --> 01:14:06,056
Attack!

541
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:12,639
Let's kill them all!

542
01:15:24,139 --> 01:15:27,764
What the hell is going on here?
Is the carnival in town?

543
01:16:21,473 --> 01:16:23,473
Is that a tank?

544
01:16:33,139 --> 01:16:35,223
- Damn!
- Run!

545
01:16:35,389 --> 01:16:36,973
Help!

546
01:17:03,889 --> 01:17:06,348
Daniel! Tank!

547
01:18:19,556 --> 01:18:22,181
- Shouldn't we help them?
- Help who?

548
01:18:22,348 --> 01:18:27,348
Those with bad skin in German uniforms or
those with bad skin in Russian uniforms?

549
01:18:57,431 --> 01:18:59,014
Okay.

550
01:19:11,931 --> 01:19:13,806
Good boy.

551
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:29,931
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!
- What the hell is going on?

552
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,348
Damn if I know.
Looks like a video game.

553
01:19:33,514 --> 01:19:35,973
Look, that's him.
It's Martin Hykkerud!

554
01:19:37,931 --> 01:19:39,389
- Damn, it's him.
- Should we get him?

555
01:19:39,556 --> 01:19:42,889
No, no, no, no.
Let's wait until it calms down.

556
01:19:43,056 --> 01:19:46,556
Tactical police work.

557
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:15,223
Zombie Squad.
It's about time!

558
01:20:15,389 --> 01:20:17,764
- That's a long story.
- There was a tank.

559
01:20:17,931 --> 01:20:20,264
A guy took my jacket.

560
01:20:20,431 --> 01:20:25,431
Looks like you found Stavarin and his men, I see.
Yeah, but they're still more than us.

561
01:20:25,598 --> 01:20:28,431
I guess it's time we even
out the odds a bit, huh.

562
01:21:13,056 --> 01:21:15,056
Folks! We're losing!

563
01:21:16,264 --> 01:21:18,098
Look!

564
01:21:20,014 --> 01:21:21,848
Shit!

565
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:33,889
No, no, no.

566
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,139
No!

567
01:21:44,681 --> 01:21:46,389
Wait!

568
01:21:47,223 --> 01:21:49,389
We have to kill him!

569
01:21:49,556 --> 01:21:52,264
They're all bound to him like the
Russians are to you.

570
01:21:52,431 --> 01:21:55,514
If he dies, the others will too.

571
01:21:57,889 --> 01:22:01,264
Let's finish this.

572
01:22:03,348 --> 01:22:05,264
Untermensch.

573
01:23:21,598 --> 01:23:24,639
Guys, come on.
No seat belts?

574
01:23:24,806 --> 01:23:27,014
You're asking for it.

575
01:23:56,973 --> 01:23:59,764
Fucking hell!
How many more of these are there?

576
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,723
Is this it?

577
01:24:09,723 --> 01:24:12,348
Monica, is this how it's gonna end?

578
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:14,223
No, no.

579
01:24:15,181 --> 01:24:17,556
- Are we gonna die now?
- No.

580
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:22,056
Fuck it.

581
01:24:23,389 --> 01:24:25,764
Fuck it, I'm just gonna say it.

582
01:24:27,181 --> 01:24:28,889
I,

583
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:31,848
Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, am ...

584
01:24:32,806 --> 01:24:34,514
No!

585
01:24:36,389 --> 01:24:38,431
- Blake!
- Glenn?

586
01:24:39,306 --> 01:24:41,098
Monica ..

587
01:27:47,723 --> 01:27:50,723
Why didn't you just stay
on the mountain?

588
01:27:55,056 --> 01:28:00,348
You got what you wanted.
You got the gold. The treasure.

589
01:28:04,473 --> 01:28:06,723
But it was not enough.

590
01:28:09,473 --> 01:28:12,639
You were greedy.

591
01:28:12,806 --> 01:28:15,889
You wanted more.

592
01:28:16,056 --> 01:28:17,973
Blake!

593
01:28:20,931 --> 01:28:23,306
- Monica.
- Watch out.

594
01:28:26,264 --> 01:28:28,098
- Monica!
- Blake!

595
01:28:32,306 --> 01:28:34,431
Blake! No!

596
01:28:45,723 --> 01:28:48,264
That's why you lost, you know.

597
01:28:48,431 --> 01:28:51,806
Because you were greedy.

598
01:28:57,181 --> 01:29:00,306
You know you lost the war?

599
01:29:02,098 --> 01:29:04,723
Lost everything.

600
01:29:06,264 --> 01:29:09,348
Ridiculed.

601
01:29:09,514 --> 01:29:11,848
Pathetic.

602
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,723
And you know what?

603
01:29:17,014 --> 01:29:18,389
You lose again.

604
01:29:27,556 --> 01:29:29,181
No!

605
01:29:42,389 --> 01:29:44,098
Oh my God!

606
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:49,098
He did it!

607
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:54,389
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked. I knew it.

608
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,223
Herzog is dead.

609
01:29:58,389 --> 01:30:00,639
He is dead. Yes!

610
01:30:16,139 --> 01:30:18,889
Holy cow, that was close.

611
01:30:30,723 --> 01:30:34,139
You did it!
You killed Herzog?

612
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:38,556
I can't believe that
that actually worked,

613
01:30:38,723 --> 01:30:41,389
Of course it did.

614
01:30:41,556 --> 01:30:44,348
You doubted the Zombie Squad?

615
01:30:45,889 --> 01:30:48,514
Glenn Kenneth, is he ...?

616
01:30:50,973 --> 01:30:53,014
He didn't make it.

617
01:31:04,181 --> 01:31:08,181
It's been a true honor killing
zombies with you guys.

618
01:31:08,931 --> 01:31:11,931
You too, Martin.

619
01:31:16,306 --> 01:31:19,764
What is it?
Okay.

620
01:31:20,973 --> 01:31:23,639
- You can say it.
- Go for it.

621
01:31:26,973 --> 01:31:29,681
May the Force be with you.

622
01:31:33,181 --> 01:31:37,181
Really? That one?
Of all ...? You chose that one?

623
01:31:37,348 --> 01:31:41,473
There's like a million to chose from,
why would you chose that one?

624
01:32:05,598 --> 01:32:08,931
- Where the hell are they? They were just here.
- Damn if I know.

625
01:32:09,098 --> 01:32:12,848
Damn! Bjarne!

626
01:32:13,806 --> 01:32:16,056
Are you in a coma?

627
01:32:16,223 --> 01:32:18,598
Go and find them, damn it!

628
01:32:22,389 --> 01:32:27,681
I should have solved this case.
Ending up with a hundred new bodies...

629
01:32:27,848 --> 01:32:32,889
Where do we put them all?
The garage and the cooler are packed.

630
01:32:33,056 --> 01:32:36,306
I don't know! I don't know.

631
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:47,431
The seagulls again. They haven't
eaten this good since the war.

632
01:32:49,431 --> 01:32:53,056
We should have had the
damn machine, you know.

633
01:32:53,223 --> 01:32:56,473
A machine to translate seagull
language to human language.

634
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,306
Then we would have cracked this case
wide open like an egg. You get it!

635
01:33:00,473 --> 01:33:03,348
Like an egg.
