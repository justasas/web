1
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:20,107
* Goodbye, no handshake to endure *
* Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow *

2
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:34,917
* There's nothing new in dying now *
* Though living is no newer *

3
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:38,416
The unthinkable had occurred.

4
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,833
It was on April 26, 1945.

5
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:47,999
The Russian army had encircled Berlin

6
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,416
and was advancing on the Reichstag, street by street.

7
00:00:53,209 --> 00:00:56,833
You could see the sun behind
the clouds that day...

8
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:02,374
and the scent of lilacs wafted
over from abandoned gardens.

9
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,249
Where do I start?

10
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:11,333
What are the right words?

11
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,874
As a journalist I had
travelled to 12 countries.

12
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,999
I had lived in Moscow, Paris and London.

13
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,291
I enjoyed living in Paris and London.

14
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,083
But I came back.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,083
I wanted to be part of it.

16
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,416
My name doesn't matter.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,624
I was just one of many who believed
in my country's destiny.

18
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:41,999
Doubts...

19
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,791
were for the weak.

20
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:47,124
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
A never-ending triumph.

21
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:48,958
Russia lacks leadership.

22
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:50,999
By the time they recover,

23
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,458
we'll be in Moscow.

24
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,749
Sorry for barging in,
but we happen to be at war.

25
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,124
The day Gerd left,

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,291
his boots echoed through the house.

27
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:10,958
We were convinced we were right.
We all breathed the same air and

28
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,124
it was intoxicating.

29
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,458
He helped me out of my coat...

30
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:19,666
The Russians have no idea
what's going to hit them.

31
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,874
We were off to the Sorbonne,
chattering away in French.

32
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,791
And he thought I was one of
those big, blond Swedes.

33
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,083
I skipped to get in step with him.

34
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,208
Then he stopped and said,

35
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,874
Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer.

36
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,708
And that was the end of that.
A shame.

37
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:46,458
One moment! Without music...

38
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:51,833
I'd like us...

39
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,166
to take a moment to think of our men
who are scattered across Europe...

40
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,083
and, in doing so, include them in this evening.

41
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,624
Run!

42
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,249
Get out of here!

43
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,041
Go!

44
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,541
Come here!

45
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:47,124
Get in there!

46
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,333
Hurry!

47
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:04,791
No uniforms and no weapons,
or they'll shoot us.

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,791
Felix, where are you?

49
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,333
Anyone see my son?

50
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:23,166
No news. No orders.

51
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:26,749
Nothing! Nobody gives a damn about us.

52
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,874
Lenchen?!

53
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,124
Where are you?

54
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,458
In some parts of town they're
even welcoming them.

55
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:36,791
Russian swine!

56
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,124
They had been booksellers.

57
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,208
They sometimes spoke French.

58
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,708
And that's the pharmacist's widow.

59
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:50,374
Her husband once cured
Hindenburg of a headache.

60
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,791
That's all over.

61
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,291
Now we step on the corpses of dead women

62
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,208
just to get at a jar of jam.

63
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:09,041
That is Frau Binder, a musician.
Her husband is missing.

64
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,458
Can someone help me?

65
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,624
She can't breathe! She...

66
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,124
Look at me!

67
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,249
I'll write it all down,

68
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:31,666
Gerd, for you to read.

69
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,374
Like some?

70
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,916
Thanks.

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,916
She's from Silesia.

72
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:50,208
Too much to take.

73
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,749
Hurry!

74
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,124
Get under there!

75
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,999
Mami?
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

76
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:12,958
Halt!

77
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,749
Residents of Berlin!

78
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,916
Residents of this street!

79
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,124
All weapons must be
handed over at once!

80
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,499
This is your last chance.

81
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,041
Surrender your weapons!

82
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,083
This is your last chance.

83
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,541
Go ahead! There!

84
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:00,499
Move!

85
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,749
Go to the top!

86
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,166
Move back! Careful!

87
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,749
This way! Hurry!

88
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,208
Careful!

89
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,624
Comrade Colonel!
The men have almost reached

90
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:37,083
the station.

91
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:42,249
The order was to proceed
to the Reichstag.

92
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,124
Yes, sir, comrade Colonel!

93
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,499
No Reichstag?
Why not? It's so close!

94
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,124
We're going on, dammit!

95
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,708
That's an order!

96
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:08,333
Secure the flanks!

97
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,041
You hear me?

98
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,499
What...what do you want?

99
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,041
You speak Russian?

100
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:19,666
Russian?

101
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:21,791
Come!

102
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,041
Eat.

103
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,666
War kaput.

104
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:34,708
Woman...come!

105
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,166
Eat.

106
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:41,791
War kaput, woman.

107
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,791
No afraid.
No afraid.

108
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,624
We won't let them bury us here.

109
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,208
Woman, come!

110
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,749
No afraid!

111
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,499
Come, come!

112
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,791
No afraid!

113
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,666
Come! Pretty girls!

114
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,499
Come here!

115
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:43,791
Be nice and you'll get something to eat!

116
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,874
Potatoes, very good.

117
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,124
May I?

118
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,916
Who knows how this works?
Hey, Ukrainian, do you know?

119
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:17,541
So here are our Soviet liberators!

120
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,374
Overjoyed, obviously amazed at themselves

121
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,124
for getting this far.

122
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:30,041
I know them, their sandals, villages
and shabby new buildings,

123
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,874
they're so proud of.

124
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,958
They won't strain themselves.

125
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,166
Hey!

126
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:58,499
Urine! Try some urine!

127
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,458
That's enough!
No, seriously...

128
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,416
Your urine is too old.

129
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,374
I used urine to get my General

130
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,916
in Leningrad back on his feet...

131
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:14,541
Come on!

132
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,583
It's true!

133
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,083
Just what are they doing there?

134
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:30,208
Please!

135
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,458
Husband?

136
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,124
Husband and two children.

137
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,749
Come!

138
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,083
Now!

139
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,166
Let me through!

140
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,041
No!

141
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,166
You don't belong here!
Let me go!

142
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,624
I didn't do a thing!

143
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:15,374
Most of my countrymen are now very clever
when it comes to saving their own skins.

144
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:19,166
You're endangering all of us!
The Silesian girl was an easy victim.

145
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,333
Go on!

146
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,833
Here, hurry.
The attic apartment on the right.

147
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,666
Hurry! Go on!

148
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,249
Take it and go!

149
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,624
Go on!

150
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,999
Say something!
You speak Russian!

151
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,374
You can't let them do this!

152
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,291
Pretty woman!

153
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:02,166
Soldier!

154
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,583
Why do you take a woman...

155
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,708
who has no desire?

156
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,249
Willing women are dirty.

157
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:44,958
Open up!

158
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:27,458
Not here.

159
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,958
Where?
We're almost there.

160
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:04,333
Stop! Come back!

161
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,333
Commander...

162
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,791
I'm looking for a commander.
What's wrong?

163
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,083
Are you the commander?

164
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,749
I...We need help.

165
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,666
Are you the commander?

166
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,791
Lots of commanders.
We're all commanders.

167
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:44,541
Which one do you want?

168
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,374
Major...

169
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:53,916
We need your help.

170
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,458
All our men are healthy.

171
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:26,666
Frau Hitler!

172
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,041
Our country is in ruins.

173
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,749
Gerd, remember your first words?

174
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,541
You said, 'Thirty minutes'.

175
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,291
Give me thirty minutes and
you'll never leave me.

176
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,833
God help us!

177
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,208
The back hallway.

178
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,749
The widow offered me a place to stay.

179
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,791
She led the way...

180
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:57,291
to an apartment that was
surprisingly intact.

181
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,999
I accepted.

182
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:01,874
And here...

183
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,291
You can stay here for the time being.

184
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:09,583
The move was easy.
A few steps up to my studio.

185
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,291
A blouse, a few books
and some notes.

186
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,749
You can stay if you like.
Thanks.

187
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,958
I'd like that.

188
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,583
Take care.

189
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:41,416
I should have looked around a little.

190
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:44,499
But we never see everything.

191
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,708
And the story took its course.

192
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,333
This was a nice place.

193
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:08,791
How...

194
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:11,916
did you find me?

195
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,166
I searched every cellar.

196
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,583
How often?

197
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:41,874
Often.

198
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,208
The riverbanks are dressed in green.

199
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,708
The trees breathe lightly, deeply.

200
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,374
We go on fighting courageously.

201
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,166
In the last Battle of this war.

202
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:00,666
It was a long way to this May.

203
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,166
It cost a lot of strength and courage.

204
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,833
But now we're free again.

205
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:09,333
And we proudly stand guard!

206
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:11,541
Hello, May!

207
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,583
Our soldiers and US weapons...

208
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,791
They'd be gone!

209
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,166
Yes.

210
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:33,666
Yesterday at the pump,

211
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:36,624
it was my turn and somebody came up

212
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:41,541
with two Iron Crosses and
one German Cross in gold.

213
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,749
And he took my bucket gallantly.

214
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,374
I said, 'What an honour, I'm not used to this'.
He said,

215
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,833
You have to be strong, ma'am.

216
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:56,124
Because if the Russians do just
a fraction of what we did

217
00:26:56,542 --> 00:27:01,374
to them during the last four years...

218
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:03,874
and he said...

219
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,791
then presently no German would be left alive.

220
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:12,624
Presently? Nobody says that any more.

221
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,249
I have a question.

222
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:43,416
How do I say,
'Excuse me, do you have a dictionary?'

223
00:27:43,792 --> 00:27:46,374
He doesn't need one for what he wants.

224
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:04,874
Lenchen!

225
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,916
Come with us!

226
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:19,374
Go with them?

227
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,416
Where to?

228
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:26,166
Our house was stormed
for the next few days.

229
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:28,541
Day and night.

230
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,416
One woman hung herself.

231
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:34,416
Another was shot and killed.
Nobody...

232
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,374
was spared.

233
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,541
Every feeling is dead.

234
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,166
Lenchen!

235
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,416
What's that?
A map.

236
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:19,291
Where are you going? Come over here!

237
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,208
Over there!

238
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:32,166
Stand up, wretched of the Earth
who are forced to starve.

239
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:37,041
Reason thunders in its volcano.
This is the eruption of the end.

240
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,083
Go away!

241
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:09,874
I...

242
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,374
I love you!

243
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,708
Hello.

244
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,166
Please don't!

245
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,166
My lovely!

246
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,791
I come back.

247
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:38,499
My lovely.

248
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:30,208
I'm a young man.

249
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,624
You startled me.

250
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:14,749
We'll survive.

251
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:21,166
At all costs.

252
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,416
Where to?

253
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,583
We're here!

254
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:32,583
Where are they now? Our rescuers?
The great armies?

255
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:37,624
War and dying used to be men's business.
That's all over.

256
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:41,249
Damn Russians!

257
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:46,499
Officer, General, Commander.
I go for the highest rank.

258
00:34:48,084 --> 00:34:50,583
Starting now, I decide who gets me.

259
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:53,541
No, no, no.

260
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,583
Out of there!
It's still my bed!

261
00:34:58,042 --> 00:35:02,374
You can protect us on the couch.
Look it up: 'Protect'.

262
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,749
Like this! You don't have to sleep in my bed.

263
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,541
Did you understand me?

264
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,833
Where's the Major?
Wait.

265
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:59,458
Fraulein! Who are you looking for?

266
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,333
Hey, Blondie! Why so glum?

267
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:17,333
How about scrubbing
my back with soap?

268
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,249
Who would you like to talk to?

269
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,124
You.

270
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:01,458
Dismissed!

271
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,624
May I sit down?

272
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,124
No!

273
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:41,666
Our building was stormed yesterday

274
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:46,874
and many women raped.

275
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,374
I know nothing of it.

276
00:37:56,084 --> 00:37:58,458
It is your duty to help.

277
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:09,791
Help who?

278
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:13,749
My people or yours?

279
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:19,583
Me.

280
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:35,291
What do those few minutes matter?

281
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:49,083
It's pointless.

282
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,666
You speak Russian?

283
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:56,791
What do you look for?

284
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,833
Looking for officers?

285
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,249
Officer?

286
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,749
All with their women.
But I am here.

287
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:09,874
Lieutenant, may I speak with you?

288
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:15,624
Several balconies in our
house are booby-trapped.

289
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,666
Can you help us?

290
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,374
Too bad.

291
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:35,499
Fraulein!

292
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:44,124
You and me, tonight?

293
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:54,624
Me Anatoi.

294
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,416
You and me...

295
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,291
It's that simple.

296
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,124
It was then I swore that nobody

297
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:09,333
would touch me, unless I let them.
No matter what.

298
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,333
Come in! Follow us!

299
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,499
Time to go to your friends.

300
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:30,541
Hey!

301
00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:35,708
That is my husband!

302
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:37,666
Don't you understand?

303
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,874
My husband!

304
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:46,083
You must understand.

305
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:49,624
All people are bad.

306
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:58,958
I don't understand him.
He won't leave.

307
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,958
What are you doing?
This is mahogany!

308
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,874
Calm down! Go to the kitchen!

309
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:27,999
Me, Charkov!

310
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,333
He comes from Charkov.

311
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,249
Me industrial Clerk.

312
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,208
Accountant.

313
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:36,749
No! Me accountant!

314
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,333
You accountant!

315
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,291
We accountant!

316
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:45,416
Everything good!

317
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,249
That is life.
Understand?

318
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:49,666
You, lovely!

319
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:54,499
These Russians are great.
So full of life!

320
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:55,916
It's about time

321
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,958
all this shit was over.

322
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:02,083
Right, when I get back to Charkov,

323
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,791
I'll get married and build a house,

324
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:08,916
have kids, work on a collective farm
and he'll be my accountant.

325
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,124
Are you a professional soldier?
No.

326
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:17,458
Me...dairy!

327
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,791
Milk!
Dairy?

328
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:21,124
Cow!

329
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:27,583
That's interesting.
No interesting! Milk...

330
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:30,333
and milk.

331
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:34,374
All shit! Look at this!

332
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,416
My trophies!

333
00:42:38,459 --> 00:42:41,041
That's nothing! Here!

334
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:44,999
This is a trophy!
That's no trophy!

335
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:47,874
Here! Look at this!

336
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:50,958
This is a real trophy.

337
00:42:56,625 --> 00:43:00,416
My present to the ladies!
For them to kiss!

338
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,333
Where toilet?

339
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,583
Toilet in hallway.
Thank you.

340
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:36,916
Like something else to eat?

341
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,374
You.

342
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:21,499
Want my cock?
Does not matter who!

343
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,083
Cock is cock!

344
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,999
Why Russia?

345
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,833
Why?

346
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:37,374
What's wrong with you people?

347
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,083
Why Russia?

348
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:51,416
This is Major...

349
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:54,333
I'm afraid I've forgotten his name.

350
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:07,958
He's the battalion commander.
They don't have a commandant.

351
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,124
Did you know,

352
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:12,999
German is the first foreign
language they learn?

353
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:18,708
It takes a war for us to discover that.

354
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:21,374
Can I do anything for you?

355
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,833
Hey, Mongolian!

356
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:34,208
Did you come here from Moscow
to get water for a German?

357
00:45:34,584 --> 00:45:37,666
Or is our Major bathing
in essence of roses?

358
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:51,374
A German product!

359
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,208
I'm responsible for the Major.

360
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:01,249
Go on, I'll be there shortly.
Go on!

361
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,374
Get moving, Mongolian!

362
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,916
Get moving! Go!

363
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,458
Run, Mongolian!

364
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,374
Then a bomb landed in the neighbour's yard

365
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,749
and turned the whole
house into kindling.

366
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:29,791
And their pig was blown to pieces!

367
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,333
And no longer edible.

368
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,499
Here!

369
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:48,874
Let go, Masha!

370
00:46:57,834 --> 00:46:58,958
Please excuse

371
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:02,458
my behaviour.
Dismissed.

372
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:30,166
Berlin is ours!

373
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:31,583
Here!

374
00:47:43,959 --> 00:47:46,999
I told them all to leave.

375
00:47:51,459 --> 00:47:53,874
May I sit down?

376
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:04,374
Come over here.

377
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,833
As you wish.

378
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:44,249
No?

379
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:12,791
The raping continues.

380
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:17,124
They are everywhere, in every home.

381
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,874
We are Russians now.
At their service.

382
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:25,791
And we women will have to keep silent.

383
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:29,249
Or no man will ever
want to touch us again.

384
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,083
Poor Germany.

385
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,749
Take me with you.

386
00:49:42,209 --> 00:49:43,499
Nineteen soldiers.

387
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:23,874
Four! Four women!

388
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,416
Berlin is one big whorehouse!

389
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,583
Look at this!
They have everything!

390
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,958
They have jewels! Money! Houses!
And they make war! Bastards!

391
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:44,583
Enough!

392
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,874
What do I think about them?

393
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,624
Sometimes I feel I could
put up with anything.

394
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:01,666
As long as it comes from without

395
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:05,291
and doesn't ambush me
from within my heart.

396
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,749
I'm doing fine.

397
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,624
And my Russian

398
00:51:12,084 --> 00:51:13,583
is getting better.

399
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,124
Was someone here?
No.

400
00:51:46,584 --> 00:51:48,124
What a greeting!

401
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,833
Madame, I've brought you a suitor.

402
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,208
Anatol

403
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:00,624
is a Gypsy.

404
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:03,499
Comes and goes as he pleases.

405
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:05,208
No protector.

406
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,083
My sunshine.

407
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,916
Do you think...

408
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:27,083
think the Fuhrer will abandon us?

409
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:28,499
No.

410
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,499
Never.

411
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:39,958
Here.

412
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,374
Is that all?

413
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,041
My head aches.

414
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:09,749
Where are you going?

415
00:53:10,459 --> 00:53:13,916
To get you something to eat,
if it's the last thing I do.

416
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:27,374
Why the Reichstag? Fuck him!
And fuck the Reichstag!

417
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,749
Then he grabbed me and
threw me on the bed,

418
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:39,249
and suddenly he became very boring

419
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:42,583
like a little puppy.

420
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:46,624
And afterwards he made me a compliment.

421
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,333
He said,

422
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,833
'Ukrainians like this'.

423
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,874
'And you like this'.

424
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:03,083
But...

425
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,958
he had such bad breath.

426
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:21,124
Oh, it's you!
Good morning.

427
00:54:21,834 --> 00:54:23,374
We're bringing you breakfast.

428
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,374
The next morning, a few blocks
away the war was raging,

429
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:29,124
the Major came with all his men.

430
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:31,541
Good morning.
Morning.

431
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,833
The widow who could be had
for a scrap of bacon

432
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,749
buzzed around like a bee.

433
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:44,958
And Herr Eckart, our Volkssturm man,
was ready to surrender.

434
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:46,374
This way!

435
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,208
Russian horse.

436
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:52,374
What's this?

437
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,208
Sugar! We have sugar!

438
00:54:57,834 --> 00:54:59,124
And bacon and salami...

439
00:54:59,584 --> 00:55:01,249
What a delight!

440
00:55:01,709 --> 00:55:02,999
But not for everyone.

441
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,499
Then came the cavalry,

442
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:11,249
coats flying, swords raised, horses panting.

443
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:13,083
When a horse charges,

444
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,291
it has incredible strength.

445
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,916
And the whole avalanche charged

446
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:22,041
the tanks, the artillery, the machine guns.

447
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:24,958
Destroyed them all!

448
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,874
Your soldiers outnumbered us,
but they dropped their guns

449
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,124
and ran away.
German soldiers!

450
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:36,666
Soldiers, officers, everyone! Afraid!
Don't be so rude.

451
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,999
We didn't start the war.
Sit down!

452
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,999
And stop insulting our hosts.
Enough!

453
00:55:43,959 --> 00:55:47,124
Me the Caucasus Mountains. Understand?

454
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:50,208
Caucasus Mountains big, so beautiful.

455
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:54,374
Sun, mountains, blue sky!

456
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,458
Beautiful dances and women!

457
00:55:58,209 --> 00:56:01,374
As sweet as raisin.

458
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,708
And Pushkin was there in exile.

459
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,833
I don't care about Pushkin.
I want to go home.

460
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,583
Home, understand?

461
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:14,666
To my wife and kids.

462
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,749
You see? And you say Pushkin?

463
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:36,374
I want my wife.

464
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,749
My wife.

465
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:41,124
Understand?

466
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,208
What do you know about fascism?

467
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:50,999
Fascism?

468
00:56:57,834 --> 00:56:59,458
It comes from Fascio.

469
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:02,958
It means 'Bundle of Reeds'.
Very old. Roman.

470
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:06,374
To our hostess!

471
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:07,874
Right!
A woman

472
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:10,249
who is obviously smart!

473
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:12,999
Just like you! Very smart!

474
00:57:13,959 --> 00:57:15,041
I'm no woman!

475
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,499
To German Russian friendship!

476
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:29,958
Hurrah!

477
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:36,999
Search every apartment!

478
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:51,874
Out!

479
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,124
You bastard! You scum!

480
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,499
Stop!

481
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,874
Enough!

482
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,999
You know Stalin's decree!

483
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:12,708
Just stop!

484
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,208
What if I don't?
Will you shoot me?

485
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,291
If I have to, I'll shoot you.

486
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,374
He's acting on my orders.

487
00:58:30,209 --> 00:58:31,124
Halt!

488
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:35,208
A young German stole some food.

489
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:37,916
He's armed.

490
00:58:39,709 --> 00:58:40,874
Who lives up there?

491
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,208
Who lives there?

492
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:52,999
Does anyone live there?

493
00:58:54,584 --> 00:58:56,249
No.

494
00:58:56,959 --> 00:59:00,333
You're lying!
You're a lying bitch!

495
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,833
I spit on Germany and Berlin!

496
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,041
We defeated them!

497
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,124
I spit on them!

498
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,958
Out of my way!

499
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:38,333
Halt!

500
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:51,291
I'll kill you, you bastard!

501
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:05,916
Everyone

502
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:09,499
in possession of a weapon
or who hides someone

503
01:00:09,959 --> 01:00:13,749
in possession of a weapon
will be shot at once!

504
01:00:14,292 --> 01:00:16,499
And the house will be razed!

505
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:38,166
They'll never forgive you!

506
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,124
Can I have something to drink?

507
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,999
You have to leave.

508
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,833
What are you doing here?

509
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:19,958
I'm not going to Siberia.

510
01:02:20,334 --> 01:02:21,999
I'm not going.

511
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:02,374
The next few days the Major came and went.

512
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:05,249
It meant protection for everyone.

513
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:12,999
He brought candles, cigars
and lots of presents

514
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,541
which the widow quickly stowed
away in her cupboard.

515
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,749
In a way,

516
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:21,374
a new era was beginning.

517
01:04:28,584 --> 01:04:31,708
A lot of Russian men like
to play Santa Claus.

518
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:34,333
Why should we women stop them?

519
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,791
That's way too much!

520
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:43,999
The Major speaks eloquent Russian

521
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:46,624
and he told me more
than I wanted to know.

522
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:49,791
I know his bank account, his parent's

523
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,624
and his brother's names.

524
01:04:52,084 --> 01:04:53,874
You're our guest today.

525
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,999
Now sit down.

526
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,958
You are so old-fashioned.

527
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:03,208
I love to touch him.

528
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,499
Let's go!

529
01:05:08,334 --> 01:05:11,124
The war raged on.

530
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:14,208
While our men were being sent
to Siberia,

531
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:17,374
many women sought protectors

532
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:20,458
and became taboo
for the rest.

533
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,333
Careful!
It's a Singer.

534
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:26,958
Not much further.
Hold it up!

535
01:05:32,084 --> 01:05:35,749
In and out, in and out!
It's like a train station in here.

536
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:43,083
Mussolini is dead!
They hung him upside down!

537
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,958
Andrei had scarcely left

538
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:05,499
when Anatol showed up.

539
01:06:05,959 --> 01:06:09,624
I was scared to death the two
alpha males would meet

540
01:06:10,042 --> 01:06:12,749
with me in the middle.

541
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:21,208
I can't really say
the Major rapes me.

542
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:25,041
I am at his disposal.

543
01:06:26,084 --> 01:06:27,583
A whore?

544
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,499
Perhaps.

545
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:34,458
I only met a whore once in my life.

546
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:38,749
People said not to talk to her,
that she was bad.

547
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:42,333
What does that mean anyway?
Bad.

548
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:45,416
Young lady!

549
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,624
No!

550
01:06:57,834 --> 01:06:58,833
Well, well...

551
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:02,874
Along she comes as if
everything were fine.

552
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:10,416
How often?

553
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,624
Four times.
You?

554
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,999
Come on!

555
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,416
I never thought I'd see you again!
You look good!

556
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,874
You do!

557
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,874
Here, quince jam.

558
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,166
A real Bordeaux!
Take it!

559
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:31,124
How classy! You're spoiled!

560
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,624
That's one way of putting it.

561
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:38,958
I'm so happy you're here.

562
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:40,999
Elke's visit cheered us all up.

563
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,874
The Major's guards protect us

564
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:47,416
as we drink his tea in peace.
It does us the world of good.

565
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:51,083
Where are you going?
What's it to you?

566
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:55,333
You can't go in.
Who's there?

567
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:05,083
So I said, 'Young man...

568
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,291
that rifle on your shoulder
could accidentally go off'.

569
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:13,083
And me?
I was going upstairs,

570
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,583
and somebody on the 2nd floor
fired a shot from inside

571
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:19,708
and grabbed me by the hair and said,
'You syphilis'.

572
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:22,333
I was terrified and said,

573
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:24,333
'No, not me!'

574
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:26,458
What an idiot.

575
01:08:32,167 --> 01:08:33,124
How's your husband?

576
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,874
He was with me the first time
and is still a bit disturbed.

577
01:08:36,334 --> 01:08:39,624
What do you think of our cavaliers?
Not impressed.

578
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:43,749
They have no imagination.

579
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:47,291
At home they may have the
latest planned economy,

580
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:51,249
but when it comes to eroticism,
they're like Adam and Eve.

581
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:55,624
That's what I told my husband.
With our scanty rations,

582
01:08:56,084 --> 01:08:59,041
your good old husband
isn't worth much either.

583
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:00,999
Well...

584
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:05,749
I guess for a good love life
you need regular meals.

585
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:08,791
My focal point is my belly.

586
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,541
No food, no fun.

587
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:16,916
Romance, pain, love, lust...

588
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:18,583
To us!
Cheers!

589
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:20,291
Who knows when we'll meet again!

590
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,041
Careful!

591
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,416
It's hot!

592
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:28,166
Apple pie!
Yes, with crumble.

593
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:30,666
It's singing to me.

594
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:35,208
You, you, you're in my heart

595
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:39,374
You, you, you're on my mind

596
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:43,291
You, you cause me such pain

597
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:47,624
You don't know just how good I am
Oh, yes...

598
01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:53,666
You don't know just how good I am

599
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:02,166
Our men aren't what they used to be, either.
They're so weak

600
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:04,291
it's hard just to look at them.

601
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,291
The weaker sex.

602
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,166
Have you heard from Gerd?

603
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,333
I have a question about syphilis.

604
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:16,791
Oh, God!

605
01:10:18,417 --> 01:10:20,624
How do you notice it?

606
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:22,666
itching, stinging.

607
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,208
And little boils.

608
01:10:25,709 --> 01:10:28,041
They show up later.

609
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:30,958
I read it in an encyclopedia.

610
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:41,333
An encyclopedia!

611
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:46,291
Here, an American gave me this.

612
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:50,541
Chew it!

613
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,791
Cool, huh?

614
01:10:56,459 --> 01:10:58,666
Americans...

615
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:01,999
They all look like actors.

616
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:07,374
Handsome, like from the movies.

617
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:16,291
I'm going.

618
01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:20,041
Tell her

619
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,791
I'll be back!

620
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:25,624
Hear me?

621
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,249
What is it?

622
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,499
A mission.

623
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:53,749
Can we count on you?

624
01:11:58,667 --> 01:11:59,958
When the day comes.

625
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:04,166
I'll be here.

626
01:12:20,834 --> 01:12:24,291
Where will you go...later?

627
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:29,124
Where I'm needed.

628
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:34,166
A special evening with the Major.

629
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,041
A good conversation.

630
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,624
He said I was marvellous.

631
01:12:40,084 --> 01:12:41,916
Nothing else mattered to him.

632
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:47,374
Contrary to German men, Russian men
appreciated educated women.

633
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:51,291
But...

634
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,916
the war wasn't over yet.

635
01:12:54,292 --> 01:12:55,708
Excuse me.

636
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:57,791
Do you have a moment?

637
01:12:58,167 --> 01:12:59,874
We...

638
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,916
We need your help.

639
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:08,874
Come on, kids.
Leave the room.

640
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,499
We'll finish building your tower.

641
01:13:17,084 --> 01:13:18,499
It's him.

642
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:27,624
Hello.

643
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,291
You Russian?

644
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:36,166
Translate!

645
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:58,041
In my village, German soldiers...

646
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:11,041
killed all the children.

647
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,666
They took them...

648
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:24,041
stabbed them.

649
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:33,666
They grabbed them by the feet...

650
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,999
Go on!

651
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:45,791
threw them...

652
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:03,749
against the walls and...

653
01:15:12,292 --> 01:15:14,166
smashed their skulls.

654
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,416
Hearsay?

655
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:26,249
Or did you see it?

656
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:33,041
I saw it.

657
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:45,166
Hey, what's the hurry?

658
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,916
Did you forget your underwear?

659
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:09,374
You speak Russian!
Tell him I have a family!

660
01:16:09,792 --> 01:16:11,583
Tell him to leave me alone!

661
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,749
You speak Russian!

662
01:16:32,959 --> 01:16:34,416
Help!

663
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,791
Where are you going?

664
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,874
I was waiting for you.

665
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:22,166
What's wrong?

666
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:25,874
Comrade Major.

667
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:39,041
Old Germany is finished.

668
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:47,916
Keep your hands off him!

669
01:17:48,959 --> 01:17:50,291
He comes to me.

670
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,999
I don't go to him.

671
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:54,791
Go away!

672
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:57,666
Why?

673
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:03,666
You people hung his wife.

674
01:18:26,459 --> 01:18:28,541
Residents of Berlin!

675
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:31,916
On 30 April, 1945

676
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,416
the Fuhrer killed himself,

677
01:18:35,417 --> 01:18:38,458
and betrayed all those who

678
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:42,083
swore allegiance to him.

679
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:46,416
The Fuhrer's orders were for you

680
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:48,541
to defend Berlin.

681
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,541
But the lack of heavy
artillery and ammunition

682
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,874
and the entire situation
make any further fighting

683
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,708
meaningless.

684
01:18:58,167 --> 01:18:59,999
Every hour you go on fighting

685
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:05,666
prolongs the dreadful suffering
of Berlin's civilian population

686
01:19:06,084 --> 01:19:07,791
and of our wounded.

687
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:12,041
All those who now die
in the battle for Berlin

688
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:15,249
are sacrificing themselves for nothing.

689
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:21,124
In agreement with the Supreme Command
of the Soviet Army, I order you

690
01:19:22,042 --> 01:19:24,124
to immediately cease

691
01:19:24,542 --> 01:19:26,291
all combat operations.

692
01:19:26,875 --> 01:19:27,874
Weidling,

693
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:29,666
General of the Artillery

694
01:19:30,042 --> 01:19:33,624
and Commander of the Defence Area

695
01:19:34,167 --> 01:19:35,124
of Berlin.

696
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:51,249
Comrade soldiers and officers
of the 8th Red Army,

697
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:55,083
this morning, the Berlin Garrison

698
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,249
surrendered!

699
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:00,416
Berlin

700
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:05,291
is defeated.

701
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:18,640
* United forever in friendship and labour *
- Союз нерушимый республик свободных -

702
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:24,540
* Our mighty republics will ever endure *
- Сплотила навеки Великая Русь -

703
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:31,540
* The Great Soviet Union will live through the ages *
- Да здравствует созданный волей народов -

704
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:36,640
* The dream of a people their fortress secure *
- Единый, могучий Советский Союз -

705
01:20:36,740 --> 01:20:47,040
* Long live our motherland, built by the people's mighty hand *
- Славься, Отечество наше свободное -

706
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:54,640
* Long live our people, united and free *
- Дружбы, народов надежный оплот -

707
01:20:54,940 --> 01:21:06,540
* Strong in our friendship tried by fire *
- Знамя советское, знамя народное -

708
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:12,040
* Long may our flag inspire, shining in glory for all men to see *
- Пусть от победы, к победе ведет -

709
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:18,040
* Through days dark and stormy where Great Lenin lead us *
- Сквозь грозы сияло нам солнце свободы -

710
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:23,040
* Our eyes saw the bright sun of freedom above *
- И Ленин великий нам путь озарил -

711
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:28,940
* And Stalin our leader with faith in the people *
- Нас вырастил Сталин - на верность народу -

712
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:34,040
* Inspired us to build up the land that we love * 
- На труд и на подвиги нас вдохновил -

713
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:41,540
* Long live our Soviet motherland... *
- Славься, Отечество наше свободное -

714
01:21:44,042 --> 01:21:46,916
I'm going back to my people.

715
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:49,499
To Siberia?

716
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,624
What about us?

717
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,874
Talk to me, Friedrich!

718
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,416
Please!

719
01:22:16,917 --> 01:22:19,666
Talk to me!

720
01:22:21,834 --> 01:22:24,208
I waited for you!

721
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:27,458
I prayed.

722
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:29,791
And I hoped.

723
01:22:31,042 --> 01:22:34,291
I prayed and hoped.

724
01:22:35,542 --> 01:22:37,458
And now I want you

725
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:41,791
to at least try

726
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,249
to stand by me.

727
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:23,041
To victory!

728
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,041
Berlin is defeated!

729
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:31,624
To the homeland!

730
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:40,041
Long live the Red Army!

731
01:23:40,417 --> 01:23:43,166
Long live Stalin!

732
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:15,666
Just a moment!

733
01:24:19,042 --> 01:24:21,499
What do we have here?

734
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:23,708
Two halibuts!

735
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:31,124
Unbelievable!
Hitler, Goebbels...kaput!

736
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:36,041
Great! Let's drink!

737
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,833
Capitulation.

738
01:25:37,209 --> 01:25:39,499
At long last.

739
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:42,666
The war is over!

740
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:45,499
How we women longed for that.

741
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,749
But now?

742
01:25:48,167 --> 01:25:51,041
A very bitter defeat.

743
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:57,291
More and more people are
talking about horrific things.

744
01:25:59,084 --> 01:26:04,124
I sense an eerie something
in the air.

745
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,791
Evil and menacing.

746
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:15,416
I don't want to think about it now.

747
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:22,916
It's all over.

748
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,291
I don't know.

749
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:29,416
I fear that misfortune has
a greater imagination.

750
01:26:44,584 --> 01:26:45,583
Listen.

751
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:49,624
They are drinking and smoking like men.

752
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,541
The Russian Army has one million women.

753
01:26:59,084 --> 01:27:01,374
They come from everywhere.

754
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,749
We have no uniforms.

755
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:08,583
The boots are too large.
Shirts and jackets...a disaster.

756
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:13,874
One of the girls came to me.
I think her name was Luba.

757
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:15,874
She said,

758
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:19,041
'Major, I believe I will be killed today'.

759
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:22,791
'I want fresh clothes'.
I said, 'No!'

760
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:27,083
You've been with us for a long time.
The bullets avoid you.

761
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:31,041
She came back two hours later.
And again and again.

762
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:32,916
So I said, 'Yes'.

763
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,166
She got a new shirt

764
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:38,166
with ribbons here.

765
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,499
As white as snow.

766
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:42,499
It was full of blood.

767
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:49,374
Every female soldier is afraid of
not being pretty when she dies.

768
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:56,416
Are you a Fascist?

769
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:11,041
Where are you going?
They're all taken!

770
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,708
The battalion commander?

771
01:28:27,834 --> 01:28:31,166
That's what I like
about you Mongolians.

772
01:28:32,292 --> 01:28:34,791
Not a word too many.

773
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:46,374
1,678 days

774
01:28:46,792 --> 01:28:48,749
I've been at war.

775
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:55,999
And now...

776
01:29:03,084 --> 01:29:05,041
And she...

777
01:29:06,334 --> 01:29:09,541
She's a whore, right?

778
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:16,166
The whole place is a whorehouse.

779
01:30:08,292 --> 01:30:12,416
You come with me!

780
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,416
A gun, huh? Peace, huh?

781
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,583
War kaput!

782
01:30:29,542 --> 01:30:31,291
Get there, I said!

783
01:30:31,709 --> 01:30:34,374
Everybody downstairs!

784
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:35,791
Hurry!

785
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:44,249
Everybody downstairs!

786
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:46,791
Let's go!

787
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:54,833
Halt!

788
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,583
Where's the gun from?

789
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,916
Whose apartment is it?

790
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:14,041
Whose?

791
01:31:15,459 --> 01:31:16,499
Mine.

792
01:31:25,834 --> 01:31:27,749
Is this hers?

793
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:29,249
It's hers.

794
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:34,541
This is a violation of
Red Army regulations!

795
01:31:35,334 --> 01:31:37,916
Long live the Fuhrer!

796
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:39,666
Liquidate her!

797
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:43,291
I hope you all die!

798
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:48,624
Did you know about the gun?

799
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:54,624
No.

800
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,749
Go back to your apartments.

801
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:59,208
Shoot them all!
Go on!

802
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:02,249
Halt!
They're all liars!

803
01:32:02,334 --> 01:32:03,541
Shoot them!

804
01:32:05,792 --> 01:32:08,166
Forget the woman!

805
01:32:08,584 --> 01:32:10,999
She's a Nazi!
Did you understand me?

806
01:32:11,542 --> 01:32:12,541
No.

807
01:32:13,292 --> 01:32:16,291
You will be questioned first.

808
01:32:16,834 --> 01:32:20,791
Did you understand me?
What are you doing?

809
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:25,249
She hid an armed soldier!
That's grounds for execution!

810
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:26,541
Go!

811
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,999
I'll have to report this.

812
01:32:37,542 --> 01:32:39,291
Torch them!

813
01:32:48,542 --> 01:32:53,666
How could you risk that?
You jeopardised us all!

814
01:32:54,042 --> 01:32:57,916
Got the Nazi monster in its own burrow.

815
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,708
The garrison of the German capital

816
01:33:01,792 --> 01:33:03,874
has capitulated.

817
01:33:21,917 --> 01:33:23,666
Traitor!

818
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,916
Me go all Berlin!

819
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:43,499
Hotel Adlon, Wedding, Kaiserdamm!

820
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:46,624
Everywhere red flags!

821
01:33:47,042 --> 01:33:48,041
Red flags!

822
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:51,249
Nice flags, good quality.

823
01:33:53,417 --> 01:33:54,874
What's wrong?

824
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,041
Fighting?

825
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,124
Stop staring! Go on!

826
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:22,166
What's wrong?

827
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:25,083
To our victory, Commander!
To Stalin!

828
01:34:25,667 --> 01:34:27,999
To Stalin!
Wait! Stay with your people!

829
01:34:28,417 --> 01:34:31,374
The war is over!

830
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,874
Here!

831
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:36,166
I've got them.

832
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:39,874
Just you look.
Ljuba, Marina, Olga, Thekla.

833
01:34:41,417 --> 01:34:44,416
And they all love me.
All of them.

834
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:48,499
Everything good?

835
01:34:51,917 --> 01:34:53,124
Want something to eat?

836
01:35:05,417 --> 01:35:08,708
Here! What's better?
Tell me!

837
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,666
His prick or my bike?

838
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:16,624
Get out before I shoot your balls off!

839
01:35:18,917 --> 01:35:22,541
We're celebrating.
Everybody, come!

840
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:25,249
The whole house!
It's an order!

841
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:29,374
Your Hitler is no human!

842
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:31,666
He is stinking filth.

843
01:35:33,834 --> 01:35:34,833
No human!

844
01:35:35,875 --> 01:35:36,916
Filth!

845
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,624
Lenchen, they're yelling upstairs!

846
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,791
Everybody! Come up!

847
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:45,624
It's an order!

848
01:35:47,334 --> 01:35:48,791
Fill it up.

849
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:52,041
Why are you standing around?
We have guests.

850
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:05,374
Why afraid?

851
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,708
Look down there.
You see...?

852
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,541
Soldiers.

853
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:28,541
Russians! Beasts!

854
01:36:28,959 --> 01:36:30,541
Or animals, as you say.

855
01:36:31,084 --> 01:36:32,874
That's right.

856
01:36:33,209 --> 01:36:36,791
Not one of us would hesitate a second

857
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:40,458
to shoot a German.

858
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:45,291
Your blood is on our uniforms and that's good.

859
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:48,749
None of them wanted to go to war.

860
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:51,999
Most of them didn't even
know what it was...

861
01:36:52,417 --> 01:36:53,624
Germany.

862
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:58,166
And now come with me.

863
01:37:04,167 --> 01:37:06,291
What is going on here?

864
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,916
Careful! It's mahogany!

865
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:11,249
Let me go!

866
01:37:16,542 --> 01:37:18,916
You dance!
Are you crazy?

867
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:23,541
This is my living room
and not a dance hall.

868
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:25,791
You understand?
Fantastic!

869
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:27,208
Not a dance hall!

870
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,791
Drink schnapps.

871
01:37:30,167 --> 01:37:31,916
Vodka, schnapps good.

872
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:36,916
You...

873
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:45,666
Sing?

874
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:49,541
He wants me to sing.
I'm not going to sing.

875
01:37:50,417 --> 01:37:52,999
What does he want?
What do you think?

876
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:56,249
No.
What do you mean 'no'?

877
01:37:56,625 --> 01:37:57,791
No, no, no...

878
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:02,166
This is Europe! Europe!

879
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:09,166
Why not? I look at you.

880
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:12,249
And you? Nothing!

881
01:38:18,042 --> 01:38:19,041
Next time!

882
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:22,916
To you!

883
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:39,916
Me Anatol.

884
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:44,249
I know.
Barbel.

885
01:38:45,459 --> 01:38:48,666
My heart calls out:

886
01:38:49,167 --> 01:38:50,874
Barbel...

887
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:09,999
I play the violin.
The violin.

888
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,416
Fiddle.
You play the piano?

889
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:17,416
In an orchestra, but not any more.
My violin is gone.

890
01:39:17,792 --> 01:39:21,916
That's good.
I want to play the piano, too.

891
01:39:27,542 --> 01:39:30,208
Why don't you go upstairs?

892
01:39:31,292 --> 01:39:32,374
Should l?

893
01:39:34,334 --> 01:39:36,249
Why not?

894
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:40,916
We all should.

895
01:39:42,667 --> 01:39:45,833
Will you come, too?
Later.

896
01:39:48,417 --> 01:39:50,791
Really?
Sure.

897
01:39:56,875 --> 01:40:00,291
It's good to have you here.

898
01:40:19,209 --> 01:40:21,208
I want to embrace you.

899
01:40:21,917 --> 01:40:23,916
For the rest of my life.

900
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:28,458
Me here, you in Moscow.

901
01:40:32,667 --> 01:40:34,124
Nobody has arms that long.

902
01:40:36,292 --> 01:40:38,083
Try!

903
01:40:45,292 --> 01:40:48,333
The Major asked me
to call him Andrei.

904
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:52,041
'Why not', I said.
The war is over.

905
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:55,624
He gazed at me for a long time.

906
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,166
Every newborn child yells for war,

907
01:40:58,834 --> 01:41:01,874
he said.
And that nothing,

908
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:06,166
no person or nation,
could stop that cycle.

909
01:41:06,625 --> 01:41:08,124
Except death.

910
01:41:16,875 --> 01:41:18,583
Not fast enough! Faster!

911
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:32,249
Everybody!

912
01:41:32,667 --> 01:41:33,916
Listen!

913
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,666
And now the song...

914
01:41:37,375 --> 01:41:40,916
I Am So In Love With You.

915
01:42:15,542 --> 01:42:17,374
Dance!

916
01:42:22,542 --> 01:42:23,541
Come on!

917
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:36,166
We're no longer a people.
We're a population.

918
01:42:36,584 --> 01:42:39,749
I mean individuals
who come together in a democracy

919
01:42:40,125 --> 01:42:43,916
and work hard for prosperity.

920
01:43:12,292 --> 01:43:14,999
Dance!

921
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:21,499
We shouldn't see it within a small framework.

922
01:43:22,167 --> 01:43:26,916
European countries will overcome
their borders and grow together.

923
01:43:27,292 --> 01:43:29,249
Like Napoleon, the victorious powers

924
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:32,166
will get rid of countries and nations.

925
01:43:32,542 --> 01:43:36,916
And we'll become a Soviet republic
with planned economy nonsense!

926
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:51,833
Thank you. I...

927
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:56,124
Herr Hoch, feeling better?

928
01:43:56,542 --> 01:43:59,541
We have to be practical.
Things will get better.

929
01:44:05,625 --> 01:44:06,916
Not so fast!

930
01:44:29,667 --> 01:44:30,874
Drink! Drink!

931
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:46,166
The Soviet Union has just started to develop.

932
01:44:46,625 --> 01:44:48,999
The future will tell.

933
01:44:51,917 --> 01:44:54,916
You love your country.

934
01:44:55,792 --> 01:44:57,791
Just as I love mine.

935
01:45:06,834 --> 01:45:08,624
My mother once said

936
01:45:10,292 --> 01:45:13,666
I would marry a man
who plays the piano.

937
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:26,166
Everyone always wondered
what this day would be like.

938
01:45:28,667 --> 01:45:29,874
Not me.

939
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:32,791
Never.

940
01:45:42,417 --> 01:45:45,041
I didn't want to experience it.

941
01:45:51,792 --> 01:45:52,791
Why not?

942
01:46:10,209 --> 01:46:12,291
If you don't tell me,

943
01:46:13,292 --> 01:46:15,541
then I'll tell you, Andrei.

944
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:22,499
War

945
01:46:23,834 --> 01:46:25,999
changes our words.

946
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:30,749
Love

947
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:34,916
is no longer what it once was.

948
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:43,291
And still...

949
01:46:47,375 --> 01:46:49,291
I still want...

950
01:46:51,292 --> 01:46:53,041
my husband to find the woman...

951
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:57,541
he left behind.

952
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:05,416
Don't go!

953
01:47:27,459 --> 01:47:30,874
We women have been branded for life.

954
01:47:33,125 --> 01:47:34,916
But for the time being,

955
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:37,416
at this very moment,

956
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:40,874
I feel just fine.

957
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:53,624
I'll get us tea.
Ilse has some.

958
01:48:30,917 --> 01:48:32,666
Morning, Lenchen.

959
01:48:33,042 --> 01:48:34,791
Is anybody up yet?

960
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:42,791
Where's Vanya?

961
01:48:43,167 --> 01:48:44,916
At work.

962
01:48:45,334 --> 01:48:46,291
And Mama?

963
01:49:22,042 --> 01:49:23,249
Ilse, come on, get up!

964
01:49:40,292 --> 01:49:43,041
Gerd, do you remember?
It was a Tuesday.

965
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:45,624
Let's go and see Felix.

966
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,916
We could smell the pine resin.

967
01:49:48,417 --> 01:49:49,666
Want to?

968
01:49:50,084 --> 01:49:53,416
We were engulfed in a cloud of butterflies.

969
01:49:56,792 --> 01:49:59,166
And you knew each one by name.

970
01:49:59,542 --> 01:50:02,124
Common blue, Brimstone,

971
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:06,416
Firebird, Swallowtail
and so many more.

972
01:50:11,167 --> 01:50:16,416
One was sunning itself on the path,
velvet brown, yellow and blue trim.

973
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:18,999
You said it was a Mourning Cloak.

974
01:50:48,625 --> 01:50:52,666
I've had so many things in my life,
an over-abundance.

975
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,583
The Major lost everything.

976
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:59,416
Damn Russian idealist!

977
01:50:59,834 --> 01:51:03,791
He sees himself the way
he wants the world to be.

978
01:51:04,792 --> 01:51:06,374
A Soviet true believer!

979
01:51:09,875 --> 01:51:11,666
But I like him.

980
01:51:12,042 --> 01:51:15,749
The less he wants from me,
the more I like him.

981
01:51:17,167 --> 01:51:18,458
Very much.

982
01:51:26,542 --> 01:51:27,541
Andrei?

983
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:05,291
Andrei is no longer here.

984
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:08,708
Transferred.

985
01:52:15,667 --> 01:52:16,833
Where to?

986
01:52:21,542 --> 01:52:22,541
Who knows?

987
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:27,416
Goodbye.

988
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:33,249
'The birds are silent.
The bells are hushed'.

989
01:53:37,209 --> 01:53:39,208
Isn't that how it goes?

990
01:53:57,834 --> 01:53:59,416
Sit down.

991
01:54:25,542 --> 01:54:26,999
The studio?

992
01:54:29,917 --> 01:54:31,416
Is it gone?

993
01:54:45,125 --> 01:54:48,624
I don't live here alone.
I know.

994
01:54:52,042 --> 01:54:55,333
Ukrainians like this...

995
01:55:47,792 --> 01:55:49,166
Here, for you.

996
01:56:57,625 --> 01:56:59,208
You're all shameless.

997
01:57:00,542 --> 01:57:02,624
Don't you realise that?

998
01:57:07,042 --> 01:57:09,416
It's disgusting just to look at you!

999
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,541
Attention!

1000
01:58:47,292 --> 01:58:49,291
I want to thank you.

1001
01:58:49,625 --> 01:58:50,666
What for?

1002
01:58:53,875 --> 01:58:56,416
Being allowed to know you.

1003
01:59:06,375 --> 01:59:09,791
Take care of yourself.

1004
01:59:25,792 --> 01:59:28,374
How do we go on living?

1005
02:00:03,125 --> 02:00:04,499
Attention!

1006
02:00:20,167 --> 02:00:21,208
Transferred!

1007
02:00:22,125 --> 02:00:24,041
That's what they call it.

1008
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,124
An honourable transfer.

1009
02:00:28,167 --> 02:00:29,749
To Siberia.

1010
02:00:31,250 --> 02:00:32,166
Who knows?

1011
02:00:53,917 --> 02:00:54,916
Gerd,

1012
02:00:56,417 --> 02:00:58,041
my beloved Gerd.

1013
02:01:00,292 --> 02:01:02,416
What do we do now?

1014
02:01:02,917 --> 02:01:04,958
Turn back the hands of time?

1015
02:01:06,417 --> 02:01:08,541
Back to the first words you said.

1016
02:01:10,334 --> 02:01:12,666
You said, '30 minutes'.

1017
02:01:17,875 --> 02:01:21,291
Just give me 30 minutes and
you'll never leave me.

1018
02:04:01,292 --> 02:04:18,749
What?

1019
02:04:25,167 --> 02:04:26,749
No answer.

1020
02:04:28,667 --> 02:04:30,791
Two days later he was gone.

1021
02:04:32,250 --> 02:04:34,499
I don't know if he'll be back.

1022
02:04:35,167 --> 02:04:38,166
I'm surprised it doesn't
hurt any more.

1023
02:04:38,625 --> 02:04:40,291
But I have so much to do.

1024
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:43,624
I have to find a flint stone.

1025
02:04:44,042 --> 02:04:48,666
Mop up the puddles in the studio
and scavenge for greens.

1026
02:04:51,084 --> 02:04:53,666
I found some lilacs yesterday.

1027
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,166
Does Gerd ever think of me?

1028
02:04:58,167 --> 02:05:02,624
Who knows? Maybe his heart will
speak again and I'll see him...

1029
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:05,833
Someday.

1030
02:05:10,542 --> 02:05:13,458
WHEN THE DIARY
'ANONYMA: THE DOWNFALL OF BERLIN'

1031
02:05:13,542 --> 02:05:16,333
WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN GERMANY IN 1959,

1032
02:05:16,417 --> 02:05:20,166
IT WAS INDIGNANTLY REJECTED,
IT WAS A DISGRACE TO GERMAN WOMEN.

1033
02:05:21,209 --> 02:05:23,916
SHOCKED BY THE CONTEMPT
OF HER CONTEMPORARIES,

1034
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,666
THE AUTHOR FORBID FURTHER PUBLISHING
OF HER BOOK UNTIL HER DEATH.

1035
02:05:27,792 --> 02:05:31,249
AND EVEN AFTER SHE WAS GONE,
HER NAME WAS TO BE KEPT SECRET.
