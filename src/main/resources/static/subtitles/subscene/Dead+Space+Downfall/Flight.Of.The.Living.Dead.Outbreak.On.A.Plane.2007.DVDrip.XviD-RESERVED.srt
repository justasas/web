1
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,035
How are things back there.

2
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,440
Oh it's fine, slow.
I'm glad we're only a quarter-full.

3
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,520
Yeah, same up here.

4
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,400
Did you hear something
about the weather front?

5
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,595
Yeah, these things used to bother me.

6
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,669
The weather?

7
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,799
No, that we're going
to be delayed getting into Paris.

8
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
Please tell me you're panning
on getting some sleep tonight.

9
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,636
I can promise you we'll be in bed early.

10
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,870
Emily why don't you go out with us.
It will be so fun.

11
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,995
Yeah, Paris at night.

12
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,991
Ze Champs Elysee. Ze clubs.

13
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,877
- Ze men with their...
- I will be busy.

14
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,155
Now if you please excuse me ladies
I have some work to do.

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,276
Yeah.

16
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,709
That's a hint.

17
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,110
Aye Aye.

18
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,156
So what's the deal with the special cargo?

19
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,836
It is some last minute top leve
I government contractor shipment.

20
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,919
It says there's an armed guard in the hull.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,149
That's a first.

22
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,273
What are we carrying?

23
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,028
I'm not sure I want to know.

24
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,315
Well, looks like al
I the signatures check out

25
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,755
so we are free to take it from the S.O.C.

26
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,158
It says here if there are any
abnormalities involving the cargo area.

27
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,518
Abnormalities?

28
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,549
We are to contact
a Dr. Bennett and Dr. Sebastian.

29
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,037
These were the guys
that secured the cargo.

30
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,678
They're in first class.

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
Abnormalities?

32
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,395
I'm glad this is my last flight.

33
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,549
Yeah.

34
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,559
Lucas, you need to settle down now.

35
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,153
You're not listening.

36
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,312
We could lose Kelly
and I'm not going to let that happen.

37
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,560
Would you calm down.

38
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,549
You're making a scene.

39
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,119
Now I told you.

40
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,599
I will bring Kelly out of stasis

41
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,796
when we have a controlled environment.
Not before.

42
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,269
We all know this is highly unorthodox.

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,636
We had to move quickly.
This is her our, only way out.

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,596
Unorthodox?

45
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,989
Hey! She was dying and we saved her.

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,349
If we hadn't intervened, she'd be dead.
You god damn well know that.

47
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Now, were we able to reach our friend?

48
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,639
Kolinsky's made all the arrangements

49
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,676
for the transport
and we'll see him in Prague.

50
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,672
Prague?
I though we had a lab set up in Toulon.

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,436
Christ, our files have been hacked.
That will be the first place they look.

52
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,760
We are running out of time!

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,719
There have always been risks.
But think of the good we are doing.

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,439
We will save loved ones.
We will bring them back.

55
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,999
It's why we all have sacrificed.

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,957
Kelly knew the risks going into this.

57
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,680
That's easy for you to say.
That's not your wife down there.

58
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,272
Is it? Is it?

59
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,318
Shh, calm down. Sit down.

60
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,277
Sit down. Come on, Come on.

61
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,597
Now listen to me.
I know how you feel. I really do.

62
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,600
But do you for one minute
think I don't know what's at stake.

63
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,433
My entire company depends
on the success of this project,

64
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,717
and I am less concerned about losing
one life than I am of saving thousands.

65
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,870
So I am not going to let you,
or your wife,

66
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,713
or some petty little
Bureaucrat jeopardize this project.

67
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,950
So shut the fuck up
and get back to your seat,

68
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,076
because this subject is closed for good.

69
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,878
Are we clear on this Doctor?

70
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,799
We're clear.

71
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,790
Excuse me.

72
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,471
He's not going to let this go.

73
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,595
Don't worry about it.

74
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Dr. Thorp will not be leaving Paris.

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,113
Not with us at any rate.

76
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,160
Excuse me miss,

77
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,469
I'll take a Rum and Coke please.

78
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,079
Oh, sorry Burrows. Rude of me.
Make that two.

79
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,995
Right, how bout a coke.

80
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,359
If a little bit of Bacardi were
to find its way in there,

81
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,192
it would be our little secret, huh.

82
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,800
Anything for you, Mr...?

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,951
Uh, Burrows, Truman.
But no thank you.

84
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,000
And I'm Frank.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,797
Frank Lee Strathmore.

86
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,640
It's a name rich with tradition.
My umm, My family...

87
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,234
She doesn't need to know
your family history, Frank.

88
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,916
Look, I don't expect to be tied up long.

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,195
Just a couple of parking
ticket kinda things, really.

90
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,829
I mean, how bout you and I meet
at the Eiffel tower around Mid-Night...

91
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm sorry to disappoint you but Frank here,
he's going to be a little busy.

92
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,195
That's ok.

93
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,956
Truman, if you guys
need anything, let me know.

94
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,515
Thank you.

95
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,076
OK.

96
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,110
Truman,

97
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,629
Truman.

98
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,918
Hmm. I guess that pretty
well does it for me.

99
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,508
Looks like if you play your cards right,
she could be cuffing you later.

100
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,517
You're going to shut up
and drink your coke.

101
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,080
Hi guys.

102
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,876
Hey.

103
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,160
My god you are lovely.

104
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,197
Hey stewardess. Do you think
I could get some sugar with my coffee?

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,519
So, is Ally packed?

106
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,549
She's been packed for five years.

107
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,474
The legendary Ray Bashore retiring.

108
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,880
So why isn't she with you
on your final flight?

109
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,555
She insisted on staying home
to get things ready for our trip.

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,039
So where are you two going?

111
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,350
Summer vacation with the grandkids

112
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
then we're on a slow ocean cruise
to Alaska. Just the two of us.

113
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,759
That's so romantic.

114
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,434
The ocean cruise maybe, but the kids?

115
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,314
Sounds like a nightmare.

116
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,196
Hey,

117
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,872
that's great Ray, really.

118
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,240
Thank you.

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,753
Looks bad ahead huh?

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,355
Um, not to worry.

121
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,360
So, I can't wait to go shopping
at Chanel in Paris.

122
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,160
Courtney says that
we have to go to Cariter first,

123
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,229
and then we can go to...

124
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,392
Yeah, well, I can't wait
to go surfing in Biarritz.

125
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,480
Surfing?

126
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,357
Oh yeah, we're going surfing.

127
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
ou can go surfing.

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,791
Good.

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,720
You and that slut Jackie
can go surfing all you want.

130
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,075
Wow, hey, Tony's my friend alright?

131
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,431
We're here to surf and you know that.

132
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,480
And hey, his girlfriend's a total bitch
and you know that.

133
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,391
I don't like her. Ok?

134
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,912
Whatever. OK.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,558
Ok yourself.

136
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,713
You know!

137
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,040
Hey YO, Tone.

138
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,598
- Yeah?
- Gotta go long buddy.

139
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,030
Gotta go long buddy.

140
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,234
- Oh, oh, it hurts to get scored on.
- Stop it.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,955
You're a child.

142
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,238
Wow, nice toss.

143
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,911
Hey!

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,389
I'll give it back to you
when I'm done playing with it.

145
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,515
Hey.

146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,158
Dude, she cannot take the ball.

147
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,629
Obviously she can. Nice toss.

148
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,279
- Excuse me Mr. Freeman?
- Yes?

149
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,880
Can I get your autograph?

150
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Ohh yeah, sure, sure.

151
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,429
That final putt on the last day
of the masters, man,

152
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,714
that was poetry.

153
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,550
Poetry huh?

154
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,320
Yes.

155
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,958
Alright there, here you go.
Thank you.

156
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,000
Thanks Mr. Freeman. Thanks a lot.

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,796
No problem.

158
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,511
Why can't they just leave us alone?

159
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,192
You told me this was a trip away from golf
and everything that goes with it.

160
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,560
Look, I promise that for rest of the trip,

161
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,154
I'm just gonna be plain old Billy, alright?

162
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,752
You won't even know Long Shot exists.
I promise you that.

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,116
OK.

164
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,954
I love that smile.

165
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,640
Excuse me Mr. Freeman.

166
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,117
Yeah?

167
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,760
Captain Bashore would love
to meet you.

168
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,909
When he has a break later
in the flight,

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,116
would you mind
if he stopsby for a visit.

170
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,318
Yeah, it's not a problem.

171
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,710
Thank you.

172
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,200
You know, while you're at it,

173
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,760
if you're done fawning over my husband,

174
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,676
I'd love another Bloody Mary.

175
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,320
Anna.

176
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,080
William. I'm on vacation.

177
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,400
I'll get you a drink right
away Mrs. Freeman.

178
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,356
And make sure
you put some Vodka in it this time.

179
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
Cause that's how I like to tee-off.

180
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,951
Hey, there's no reason
to be so rude alright.

181
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,311
You know I'm sure
there's someone back in coach

182
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,913
who hasn't got your autograph yet.

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
Maybe I'll go back there
and give it to them.

184
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,073
You knew what you were getting
into when you married me.

185
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,635
I thought I did.

186
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,316
You just keep twirling
that little putter of yours.

187
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,720
Cause that's all
you're gonna be twirling this trip.

188
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,836
Wasn't so little last night was it?

189
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,599
You know you've got the wrong man, right?

190
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,280
Yeah,

191
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,475
that's why Interpole
has your picture all over the internet.

192
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,279
It's a classic case of mistaken identity.

193
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,950
Yeah.

194
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,390
Hey.

195
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,276
Hey.

196
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,993
Burrows, you can't treat me like this.

197
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm not guilty. It's not fair.

198
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,400
Bouncing me all over the world
to stand trial here

199
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,391
and there for something I did not do.

200
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,395
I'm not guilty.

201
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,437
I'm not guilty.

202
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,480
No, I have a clear conscience.
I'm not guilty.

203
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,276
Yeah.

204
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,510
What is it going to take
to convince you I'm innocent.

205
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,239
An act of god.

206
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,113
Now shut up before I make you eat
that flotation device you're sitting on.

207
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,034
There we go.

208
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,315
We can fly around it but not above it.
This is a huge system.

209
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,516
It's about 150 miles east
and west of course

210
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,272
so it looks like either way we go,

211
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,713
we are screwed.

212
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,190
It's either that
or we fly all the way back around,

213
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,431
but that's going to add 30 minutes
to our flight at least.

214
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,720
Paris weather is not good
for our arrival.

215
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,879
I'm gonna deviate left
and thread the needle.

216
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
That gap might be our only shot
of getting around...

217
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,633
...this system without landing for fuel.

218
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,197
Folks, looks like it's going
to get a little bit bumpy ahead.

219
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,960
I'd like you to temain in your seats
and wear your seatbelts.

220
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,758
We'll probably be through this
in 10 or 15 minutes.

221
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,239
Thank you very much.

222
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,992
Ohh God.

223
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,075
Did you hear that?

224
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,512
Something must have shifted and fell.

225
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,400
As you know Mr. Madison, a combined
strike team of the CIA and FBI

226
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,551
seized the head-quarters
of MEDCON Labs in Los Angeles.

227
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,551
A number of arrests were made,

228
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,880
but we've been unable to determine
the wear-a-bouts of four key individuals.

229
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,110
The first one, Dr. Leo Bennett.

230
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,158
He's a head research scientist
and founder of MEDCON.

231
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,358
Noted for his work with retro-viruses,
and synthetic biology.

232
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,830
He was investigated two years ago
for illegal cloning research,

233
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,435
unfortunately, that investigation failed
to produce any indictments.

234
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,034
So far I've seen nothing
that warrants disturbing the President.

235
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,553
Can we get to the point here?

236
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,554
Look, we're trying
to reconstruct Bennett's hard-drive,

237
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,074
and we think there is cause for alarm.

238
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,715
We believe Leo Bennett is responsible

239
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,240
for the development
of a new strain of the Malaria virus.

240
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,949
And the containment
and transportation of Dr. Kelly Thorp.

241
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,196
Malaria?

242
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,600
Initially we thought it was Malaria.

243
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,752
However, we discovered that it
was something new, something different.

244
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,471
Bennett obtained a DNA sample
from a Mosquito native

245
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,960
to a remote area in Vietnam

246
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,872
which had a 100% mortality rate
within seconds,

247
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,880
which then regenerates that same organism

248
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,880
for a few seconds or longer,
depending on the subject organism.

249
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,160
What Bennett has developed is
a mutation of this same mosquito virus

250
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,400
to restart major organs
for an indefinite period of time.

251
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,473
Now what you're saying
is that his virus kills organs

252
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,993
and then brings them back to life.

253
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,308
Not just organs.

254
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,834
He apparently was experimenting
on the resurrection

255
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,309
of the entire human body after death.

256
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,958
Oh impossible.
I can't go to the president with this.

257
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,120
Jerry, I mean come on.

258
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,635
From what we've uncovered,
we believe he succeeded.

259
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,709
Ah, hello?

260
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,833
What is going on?

261
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,109
What is happening to me?

262
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,275
God damn it.

263
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,753
Jesus, what now?

264
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,358
We have electrical
and communication problems.

265
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,710
We just had a temperature drop
in the cargo hold.

266
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,996
This is Concord 239 to base.

267
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,194
This is Concord 239 to base.

268
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,037
Great, no radio.

269
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,111
With this crap for the next hour.
Perfect.

270
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,077
What the hell is wrong with you?

271
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,116
I'm sick. I need help.

272
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,315
I need help.

273
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,274
I'm a scientist with MEDCON Labs.

274
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,990
Where the hell is Dr. Bennett?

275
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,316
I need to talk to someone.

276
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,028
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.

277
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,992
Come out. I won't shoot.

278
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,676
What the fuck.

279
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,069
Fuck. Where is she?

280
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,152
Oh god, oh!

281
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,358
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

282
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,755
OK.

283
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,591
Hey will you grab me a Diet Coke
on your way back?

284
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,270
Sure honey.

285
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,349
Thanks babe.

286
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,312
Check out that dime.

287
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,868
Wow, that is one hot little biatch.

288
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,240
Ouch, fuck that hurt.

289
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,309
Oh hi honey.

290
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,317
So I guess that mid-flight blowjob
is out of the question?

291
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,035
Such a dick.

292
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,189
Sweetheart?

293
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,750
What?

294
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:30,951
Come here.

295
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,760
What? What's wrong?

296
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,309
I mean, what is somebody sees us?

297
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,360
What are you talk...

298
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,998
we're in a bathroom
what are you talking about?

299
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,957
No I... you know what I mean.

300
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,872
You're Peter's best friend.

301
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,470
So what?

302
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,796
Oh, I'm sorry.

303
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, pardon me.
I didn't mean to scare you.

304
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,672
No, it's ok. I wasn't paying attention.

305
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,149
Sir, you actually need to take your seat.
The fasten seatbelt sign is on.

306
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,434
Yeah, yeah, um.

307
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,760
Can I get you some more coffee? Ok.

308
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,749
Yes, thank you.

309
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,640
You're welcome.

310
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,676
Oh, Megan, rhymes with Vegan.
I was a vegan.

311
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,960
- Yeah?
- For two days.

312
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,188
Megan Vegan.

313
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,640
It's actually "Megan".

314
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,359
Right, no, I knew that.

315
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,509
Sir, you actually need to take your seat.

316
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,033
Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah.

317
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,838
I just, you need to be more careful.

318
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,640
I mean, people sneaking up
on you like that.

319
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,198
You know, there's strange people here.

320
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,238
You never can tell what's going
to happen on these flights.

321
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,639
- Sir you need to take your seat.
- OK.

322
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,995
- Thanks, thanks. Buckle-up.
- You're welcome.

323
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,115
Jesus.

324
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,195
Ha, wow. Cool, huh?

325
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,992
Maybe this little diversion will keep
my mind off of your tasteless cheap suit.

326
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,072
Would you feel better if I was
in a bitch-ass, orange jumpsuit?

327
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,071
Like the one you are going
to be wearing the rest of your life.

328
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,720
There you go getting nasty again

329
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,358
when I am merely offering a criticism

330
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,640
of the sartorial horror show you call a suit.

331
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,519
However, I do like the shirt.
Does it come in a man's style?

332
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,509
And for your information, the jumpsuits

333
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,875
in France are a sort of burgundy. Yeah.

334
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,400
Well you should look nice in that color.

335
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,440
And now I know what color corsage

336
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,560
to get you when big Pierre
makes you his wife.

337
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,198
Someone sounds a wee bit jealous.

338
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,150
Yeah.

339
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,153
I'm going to descend a little.

340
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,349
Is it over yet?

341
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,234
Let's find out.

342
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,800
This is Randy.

343
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,028
It's Stacy.

344
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,995
I think some of the passengers
might have been hurt.

345
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,990
How bad?

346
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,440
I don't know.
It's a mess down here.

347
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,793
Well, we'll do the best we can.

348
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,115
Just stand by.

349
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,676
Looks like we're OK for a few minutes.

350
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,558
Give them the "go ahead" to check.
Let me know what's what.

351
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,589
Well folks, we apologize for the heavy
turbulence we have just experienced.

352
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,200
It appears as though
we're clear for the moment.

353
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,033
However, we are traveling
through some unstable air.

354
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,591
So as a precaution I would like you
to remain in your seats for the time being.

355
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,080
At this time, I would only like our flight
attendants up and about the cabin.

356
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,956
Thank you.

357
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,955
Would you make sure everyone's alright?

358
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,112
Then have one of the Doctors,
Bennett or Sebastian,

359
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,873
check the cargo situation out with you.

360
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,510
The cargo?

361
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,233
I'll get my tools.

362
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,875
Is she ok?

363
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,154
It's her head.

364
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,434
You alright dude. Did you take one?

365
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,670
The fucking bag hit me in the head.

366
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,557
Come on, that was fun.
It was just turbulence.

367
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,039
My god, don't be such a baby.

368
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,030
It didn't hit you.

369
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,109
Relax.

370
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,232
What is your problem girl?

371
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,629
Oh, are you scared we're going to crash?

372
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,520
Relax bitch. Enjoy the ride.

373
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,988
Wow, Jesus, pipe down you psycho.

374
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,317
Shut up.

375
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,034
What hell's wrong with you?

376
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,320
What?

377
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,594
You are a psycho.

378
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,069
You know, and you're a fucking skank.
I'm so sick of your shit.

379
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,200
Stop it!

380
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,918
Everyone just calm down.

381
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,558
Take your seats.

382
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,756
And you take your seats too.

383
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,795
Take your seats.

384
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,754
What is wrong with you.

385
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,040
We have several warning lights

386
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,474
we don't usually get,
even with this weather.

387
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,358
It's probably nothing,
but we should look just to see.

388
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,758
I agree, why don't you two go.

389
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,470
Both of us?

390
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,837
Right.

391
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,800
Well whoever is going,
meet me by that exit door.

392
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,438
It usually takes a few minutes
to get down there

393
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,272
and there's no easy way to go.

394
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,755
God damn it.

395
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,400
I told you. I told you both...

396
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,840
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

397
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,319
Just go check on the passenger.

398
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,555
If it was a malfunction,
Kelly might be dead.

399
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,119
Yeah listen, don't take your eye off him.

400
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,952
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

401
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,800
You guys ok?

402
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,120
I'm fine.

403
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,760
But do you think
we could move up to business class.

404
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,637
I mean, the planes really empty and all...

405
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,835
- He's kidding. We're fine.
- OK.

406
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,830
Thank you.

407
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,033
Hey, I am trying to help you out here.

408
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,440
She wants you. Make your move.

409
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,158
Go boy go.

410
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,351
I'm sorry if this is a problem.

411
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,874
No problem. I'll take care of it.

412
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,073
It could be dangerous.

413
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,559
Only if you're afraid of the dark.

414
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,758
Come on Burrows.
I need to go to the sandbox.

415
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,797
What?

416
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,790
I got to pee.

417
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,158
No, you heard the PA.
Sit down and hold it.

418
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,515
Fine.

419
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,240
If you should happen
to feel something warm,

420
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,992
just move a little to your right.

421
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,833
You're like a five year old.

422
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,912
Come on let's go.

423
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,633
Easy. Take it slow.

424
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,596
Yes, of course.

425
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,749
Burrows?

426
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,235
Burrows?

427
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,000
Mr. Burrows,

428
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,876
Truman.

429
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,350
Oh my god.

430
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,074
Alright gentleman. Here we go.

431
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,708
Truman.

432
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,709
Truman.

433
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,270
What?

434
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,192
That little shit.

435
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,640
Flight-deck.

436
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,154
Captain, this is Megan at door 4L.

437
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,800
We've got a problem back here.

438
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,711
OK. How bad is it?

439
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,870
Mr. Burrows, the cop
who brought the prisoner on board,

440
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,671
was knocked out cold,
and his prisoner is missing.

441
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,480
Excuse me, have you guys seen
a funny looking skinny guy,

442
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,913
blue sweatshirt, turtle-neck,
walk through here?

443
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,276
No.

444
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,952
No? No? Alright.

445
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,275
Well that explains
the communication problem.

446
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,989
Fry,

447
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,920
Dr. Thorp?

448
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,875
Kevin?

449
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,993
Fry's not in the jump-seat.

450
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,390
My god. This can't be happening.

451
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,960
We need to get out of her, now.

452
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,360
Come on. We need to seal
the hatch now. Let's move.

453
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,156
Come on.

454
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,638
Lucas.

455
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,120
Kelly.

456
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,155
Oh god.

457
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,631
No, no!

458
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,956
Tony?

459
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,390
Tony?

460
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,750
Asshole.

461
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,358
Don't scare me like that...

462
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,400
What? Hey, where the fuck are you going?

463
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,355
That hurts.

464
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,755
Hey you two.

465
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,196
You need to be in your seats
with the belts fastened.

466
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,151
Why don't you make yourself
a fucking sandwich while you're at it.

467
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,480
What have you done?
You son of a bitch.

468
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,072
What have you brought on board?

469
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,876
Take your seats everyone. Take your seats.

470
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,076
Everyone just calm down.

471
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,434
Do you know what's going on?

472
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,669
Ray, open up.

473
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,949
What's wrong? Randy!

474
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,510
Ray, bring the plane down.

475
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,837
Ray, bring the plane down.

476
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,797
Bring the plane down right now,
or we're all going to fucking die.

477
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,672
Tell me what the hell happened down there.

478
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,708
Ray. The fucking, the fucking,

479
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,960
the fucking scientists,
they let something out of the cargo-hold.

480
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,880
What are you talking about?
Where are the doctors?

481
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,632
Their dead. Ray, their dead...

482
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,199
- Sit down!
- Look at me man.

483
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,430
Everyone's going to fucking die.
They killed them.

484
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,272
Sit down and calm down.

485
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,359
Sit down.

486
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,199
Now. Sit down.

487
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,788
What happened to you?

488
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,148
Listen to me.
Just listen to me, Ray.

489
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,118
If you don't land this plane soon,

490
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:44,198
you, me, Emily, everybody
on this fucking plane is going to die.

491
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,157
You know I can't bring her down
without warning

492
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,118
and no place to land. Think about it.

493
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,669
There is something...

494
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,074
it's not human, down there man.

495
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,960
And it's going to kill everyone on board
unless we land this plane.

496
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,030
So whatever you do,
I don't care how you do it, just, just...

497
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,880
- I need you to calm down...
- Find a place, Ray,

498
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,199
and land the fucking plane.

499
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,160
- Find a piece of straight fucking road.
- You know the radio's gone,

500
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,513
and this storm isn't helping our situation.

501
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,352
It's clear we can try to cross.

502
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,351
But I'm turning around
and heading back.

503
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,200
There's a TSA man aboard.

504
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,158
Find out which passenger he is
and get him up here.

505
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,990
Now!

506
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,271
Ray.

507
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,752
Are you sure that's the guy?

508
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,029
Ok, they're dead.

509
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,873
And you say whatever killed them,
wasn't human.

510
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,111
I know it sounds insane.

511
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,040
I saw this happen.

512
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,191
I mean those things,
I mean they ripped those men apart

513
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,872
and they were eating them.

514
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,315
You said there was a fugitive on board.

515
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,160
Is it possible you saw him down there?

516
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,388
No.

517
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,560
I told you. There were two of them

518
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,314
and these... these things aren't human.

519
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,517
I'm going to go find out
what was in those containers.

520
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,794
Where are you going?

521
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,160
I'm going to go talk
to that asshole Bennett cause he knows.

522
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,115
Sit down.

523
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,718
Well, I'll check it out and report back.

524
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,955
Any sign of him?

525
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,556
No.

526
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,440
Shoot.

527
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,320
How's your head?

528
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,390
Better than my ego.

529
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,154
Come on, he can't hide forever.

530
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,879
As soon as the turbulence settles,
I'm going to go look for him some more.

531
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,960
Don't go alone.

532
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,155
Why? Is he dangerous?

533
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,549
Well, he's probably never owned
a weapon before,

534
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,073
but he's more
of a con-artist than anything.

535
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,957
What did he do? Can you tell me?

536
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,673
He posed as an accountant,

537
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,877
stole their Jet and crash-landed it.

538
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,599
And we finally caught up to him.
Everybody wants him.

539
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,519
Why are you taking him to Paris?

540
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,320
You ok?

541
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,196
Yes.

542
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,429
You should take your seat.

543
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,839
OK. Be careful.

544
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,557
OK

545
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,951
Hey look at this.
I think I found Concord 239.

546
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,480
Nobody's been able to reach them
for over an hour.

547
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,675
Los Angeles dispatch,
this is Yellow-Knife-Center.

548
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,718
I believe I have your concord 239
on my screen.

549
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,400
It's in the middle
of two huge weather fronts.

550
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,550
And transponder indicates it's off course.

551
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,830
No, no radio contact yet. I'll try now.

552
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,795
Concord 239, Yellow-Knife-Center.

553
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,037
Concord 239, Yellow-Knife-Center.

554
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,193
Los Angeles Dispatch,

555
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,999
yes I understand.

556
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,880
I repeat, you must tell 239
to return to US airspace.

557
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,440
The Canadian government
will not permit them to land

558
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,715
or continue to fly in their airspace.

559
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,472
This decision has come
from the highest level

560
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,872
and the CDC. Is that clear?

561
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,398
Can you tell me what it is
you're transporting in the cargo-hold?

562
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,750
I'm sorry.

563
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,310
My cargo is a highly classified project
linked to our nation's security.

564
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,273
You don't have the necessary clearance.

565
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,715
I'm with the TSA, Federal Air-Marshall.

566
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,720
I need to know what's down there.

567
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,918
Well how fortunate for us to have a man
with your obvious talents aboard.

568
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,109
You seem a bit nervous Doc.

569
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,553
Is everything alright?

570
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,234
Just don't like flying.

571
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,320
Isn't it true your
two colleagues accompanied

572
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,515
the co-pilot down to the cargo-hold

573
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,113
because there was some problem.

574
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:09,950
No, no problem.

575
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,280
No problem?

576
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,793
It's just a routine mid-flight inspection.

577
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,313
Routine.

578
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,152
What I can tell you,

579
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,920
while the cargo isn't dangerous,

580
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,117
it's highly perishable
and extremely valuable.

581
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,317
So, the cargo area is off limits
to unauthorized personnel.

582
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,389
- Well, can you tell me...
- No, I'm sorry.

583
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,277
I've said more
than I should have already.

584
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,996
Burrows?

585
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,760
Yeah.

586
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,469
Paul Judd, TSA. I believe
your prisoner is in the cargo-hold.

587
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,036
Ready?

588
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,116
Hey Frank.

589
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,191
Frank.

590
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,310
Frank. Get out here.

591
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,549
Dr. Thorp.

592
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,039
Dr. Sebastian.

593
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,515
Anybody out there?

594
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,148
That's a lot of blood.

595
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,920
Somebody's in trouble.

596
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,036
Yeah, if it's Frank's
he needs help now.

597
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,670
Check that out.

598
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,112
Looks like he escaped
through the ducts.

599
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,030
I don't know.

600
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,628
That's an awful lot of blood
for a skinny little shit like Frank.

601
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,919
You go that way. I'll go this way.

602
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,799
Meet back in 5.

603
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,676
Yes.

604
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,629
Hey Frank.

605
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,508
You there buddy?

606
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,036
Why don't you come out
and talk to me, man?

607
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,352
Everything's alright. It's cool.

608
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,392
We can just talk. It's just me.

609
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,629
Frankie.

610
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,712
I'm going to kill that little shit.

611
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,718
Alright, I'm coming up.

612
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,916
Yes.

613
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,955
You're sure?

614
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,990
Outstanding.

615
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,669
Thank you Lieutenant.

616
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,880
They have located Bennett and his team.

617
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,154
Hallelujah.

618
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,158
You know Frank,
sometimes this job is really boring.

619
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,597
This is not one of those times, bud.

620
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,478
You're making this real exciting.

621
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,434
Son of a bitch.

622
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,076
Paul?

623
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,750
Frank?

624
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,116
Oh my god.

625
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,155
Oh my god I'm going to be sick.

626
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,470
Oh my god.
Cara where the fuck are you going.

627
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,073
What the fuck?

628
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,276
Tony, this bitch just got shot dude.

629
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,396
There's fucking bullets coming
from somewhere.

630
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,960
Please take your seats.

631
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,871
Take your seats. Everything's fine.

632
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,075
Please, take your seats.

633
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,560
Everything's fine.

634
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,436
Thank you.

635
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,759
Ray, it's total chaos down here.

636
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,879
There were gunshots or something
that freaked out the passengers.

637
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,430
Emily?

638
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,719
Go, take the gun.

639
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,635
My god, this can't be happening.

640
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,072
Get back.
Go back to your seats and stay there.

641
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,790
Go back.

642
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,399
Move, move, move, move.

643
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,476
Get out of my way.

644
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,278
Cara. Cara.

645
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,560
Cara, open the door.

646
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,231
Move.

647
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,036
Cara.

648
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,315
Oh shit.

649
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,515
Dude, what the fuck?

650
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,397
Get back. Get back. Get back.

651
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,151
Get back.

652
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,992
Get out of here. Get out of here.

653
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,830
Cara.

654
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,070
- Stay back there. Stay back there.
- Cara.

655
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,440
What the fuck, dude?

656
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,236
What is this?

657
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,435
- Christ.
- Holy shit.

658
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,112
Get off him. Get off him.

659
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,550
What the fuck? What the fuck?

660
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,559
What the fuck is going on?

661
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,319
Please, please,

662
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,318
please go back to your seats.

663
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,916
Oh my god.

664
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,591
Oh my god.

665
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:40,080
Oh my god, what happened?

666
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,389
What the fuck happened?

667
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,917
Please take your seats.

668
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,955
Flight-deck.

669
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,270
Ray, something's happened down here.

670
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,109
Something attacked one
of the passengers, and he's dead.

671
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,952
You got to get us down, Ray.

672
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,075
Oh my god.

673
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,880
- Megan, listen to me.
- You don't understand.

674
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,552
There's blood everywhere.

675
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,110
And, and Stacy
and one of the other passengers was hurt.

676
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,599
How did it happen?
Who attacked you?

677
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,160
I don't know,
um, maybe the escaped prisoner.

678
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,354
I can't think of anyone else.

679
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,400
Look, Megan

680
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,039
we've turned around and we'll land
the first place we can find.

681
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,714
But the only way back is through
the center of the storm.

682
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,438
We need to get the passengers
back to their seats now.

683
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,075
OK.

684
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,515
I'm scared Meg.

685
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,869
Oh, my god!

686
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,876
Shit.

687
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,833
Help me.

688
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,390
Open.

689
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,991
Oh, shit.
They're going to kill us all.

690
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,071
I really should go check
on the passengers.

691
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,109
Open this door.

692
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,040
Help me.

693
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,076
For Christ's sake,
they are going to kills us all.

694
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,800
Open the fucking door.

695
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,199
God damn it. Help me.

696
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,790
Bill?

697
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,150
Hey. What's going on?

698
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,200
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
- What's going on man?

699
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,270
I can't explain.
We've got to get out of here.

700
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,956
- They're going to kill us.
- Calm down and tell me what's going on.

701
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,120
What is going on, man?

702
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,235
We need to hide.

703
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,000
We need to hide.

704
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,594
We need to get out of here,
or we're going to die.

705
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,712
Bill, where are you going?

706
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,228
Come on, come on.

707
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,240
Where?

708
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,073
Back-galley. The floors 2 feet thick.
It's the only safe place.

709
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,434
I can't, I can't my wife is upstairs.

710
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,440
Well get her and get back
there as soon as you can.

711
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,555
Come on, now. Come on.

712
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,993
Hey you, come on.

713
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,593
- Help me get this open.
- Tell me something.

714
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,719
It's the only place we can find.

715
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,835
Shh, shh, be quiet.

716
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,120
Hey, you, you get in there.
See if you can see anything.

717
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,439
Go on. Get up. Get up.

718
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,197
See anything?

719
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,200
Help me!

720
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,679
Come on baby.

721
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,870
Come on...

722
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,675
Stacy!

723
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,400
Oh my god.

724
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,992
Are you alright? No bites?

725
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,559
We thought. We thought...

726
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,080
What? That it was me gnawing
on all the passengers?

727
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,718
No. I'm a vegetarian.

728
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,479
The overall feeling among the scientists

729
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,678
working on this is that we are dealing
with a serum transfer virus.

730
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,548
This virus is without
a known vaccine or cure.

731
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,878
But this type virus transfers
only through bodily fluids.

732
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,157
And then most effectively,
blood from an infect victim.

733
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,280
And it enters a cut or saliva.

734
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,480
The MEDCON scientists believed
they could make this work,

735
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,119
despite the side-effects.
That of being brought back from the dead.

736
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,880
In fact, they looked
at these side-effects as a benefit.

737
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,429
Let me paraphrase these notes
that we found on Dr. Bennett's desk.

738
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,388
They wanted this virus as a bio-weapon.

739
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,920
To keep soldiers fighting
after they've been mortally wounded.

740
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,550
To release a captive enemy infected
with the virus and let him infect others

741
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,789
until they all kill each other.

742
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,348
I'm going to recommend
to you and to the president

743
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,873
that we destroy flight 239
before it can reach a populated area.

744
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,709
Let me get this straight.

745
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,920
You want our forces to follow a shoot

746
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,434
to kill order regarding
a civilian aircraft?

747
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,632
We've had no communication with the aircraft.

748
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,748
We must assume the cargo has been breached

749
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,195
and that the virus has spread
throughout the passenger section.

750
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,793
The only chance we have to contain

751
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,793
this is to vaporize every
living thing aboard that aircraft.

752
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,838
Before the virus can reach
a major population center.

753
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,153
Do you concur?

754
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,195
I'm afraid I do.

755
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,518
Can you get me the president please?

756
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,073
Mother of god.

757
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,560
Get off of her. Get off.

758
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,390
Get off.

759
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,909
Oh my god.

760
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,750
Why? Why'd you do this huh?

761
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,280
Hey, I'm talking to you, man.

762
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,477
It wasn't me.
I was just following orders.

763
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,240
They told me it was
an experiment to extend life.

764
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,120
I had no idea there
would be these crazy side-effects.

765
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,760
Well look around you asshole.

766
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,910
Your side-effects
have eaten half the passengers.

767
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,560
Hey, I don't have to listen to you.

768
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,915
You were the one that seemed
like you were giving all the orders.

769
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,115
You were the one
that the cop was talking to.

770
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,155
And you were the one
that sent the others below.

771
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,229
I heard all of that.

772
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,469
You don't know
what you're talking about.

773
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,709
It wasn't me I tell you.

774
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,028
Hey, keep your voice down.

775
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,399
Well you just keep talking.
You'll draw their attention.

776
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,440
It's starting
to get really tight in here.

777
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,431
Yeah, yeah,
I think we're getting closer.

778
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,751
Ray. Ray, I'm hurt.

779
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,273
Open up. Hurry.

780
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,030
Ray.

781
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,190
Hurry.

782
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,556
Oh my god.

783
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,835
I don't know if that's going to work.

784
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,069
It has to work.

785
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,193
Let's get the other side.

786
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,030
OK.

787
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,559
Two in the chest.
One in the balls. That's what I say.

788
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,155
It's barricaded.

789
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,513
Ah, Frank I see you.

790
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,674
You get that?
He is a little pre-vert.

791
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,995
Come on.

792
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,634
- Oh my god.
- Come here Frank.

793
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,714
Where have you been?

794
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
Where have I been?

795
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,596
Where have you been?

796
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,240
Where have you been?

797
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,549
- I have been up and down this plane looking
- So have I.

798
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,390
Hey, back off.

799
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,560
Statistically speaking, the tail section
is the safest place to be in a crash.

800
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,152
- Of course, no one...
- Frank, not now.

801
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,468
Help me with this.

802
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,993
Go get something else.

803
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,960
- Get something else.
- I am.

804
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,949
Do it.

805
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,359
Right there.

806
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,551
I can't lift. There's a... wait.

807
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,670
Frank.

808
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,114
Wait, wait, wait, shh.

809
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,555
Quiet, quiet. I hear something.

810
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,469
I don't hear anything.

811
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:58,956
Go.

812
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,592
Hold on. Hold on.

813
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,594
Oh my god, baby.

814
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,480
OK, we got to go. We got to go.

815
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,151
We got to go.

816
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,673
Go, go, go, go.

817
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,595
Alright, we need to find anything
that can be used as a weapon.

818
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,832
Does anyone have anything sharp.

819
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,040
They confiscated my toenail-clippers.

820
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,112
Pearl handled with
matching tweezers. Quite lovely.

821
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,480
Damn Frank, you should have brought those.

822
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,310
You could have saved the day.

823
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,240
You never know.

824
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,800
How much ammunition do you have left?

825
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,155
I got five in here and one clip.
What about you?

826
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,912
One full clip. Five more.

827
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,876
Shit.

828
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,517
Maybe we could electrocute
the bastards.

829
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,828
- No, no.
- No, no, no, don't do that.

830
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,153
I guess that could have gone better.

831
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,633
Frank, you stupid shit.
Please tell me you're dead.

832
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,189
Where'd you find him?

833
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,390
The auxiliary lights...

834
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,320
Oh my god.

835
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:27,438
The auxiliary lights will come
on any second. I hope.

836
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,439
Frank. We need to find weapons.

837
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,439
Still no answer from the cockpit?

838
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,350
Nothing.

839
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,788
I can't believe everyone's dead.

840
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,233
My god, we're going to die.

841
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,629
Megan. Listen to me. Listen to me.

842
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,039
- We are not going to die...
- No?

843
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,997
No, we're not going to die.
I promise you.

844
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,872
I need your help.
I need you to be strong.

845
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:04,551
Right.

846
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,709
Did you see that?

847
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,949
What the hell was that?

848
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:31,756
Listen.

849
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,510
Someone's up there.

850
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:45,990
Don't shoot.

851
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,791
We need to have a plan to get
this plane down safely.

852
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,518
Does anyone know
if the pilot's still alive?

853
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,715
I, I tried to reach him.

854
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:04,710
Try him again.

855
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:05,791
OK.

856
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,239
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

857
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,151
The captain is dead.
We're on auto-pilot.

858
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,070
So what,

859
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,593
- we just fly around till they get us?
- - No.

860
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,871
Or until we run out of fuel.
Actually, that might be preferred.

861
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,229
- Run out of fuel?
- Yeah.

862
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,197
Hey, we got to get to the flight-deck
to check on the captain.

863
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,960
We got to do this now before
they start coming at us.

864
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,720
I don't think you have enough bullets
to make it to the cockpit.

865
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,551
The guard down below has a weapon.

866
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,470
We need that weapon.

867
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,600
That's our only chance.
- Absolutely.

868
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,999
So what? You're just going
to go down there?

869
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,469
Down there. How do we know
he didn't use all the ammo already.

870
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,834
We don't know, Frank.

871
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,717
It's good to know that you still have
a sense of humor in a time like this.

872
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,800
I know it's not much to look at
but with any luck,

873
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,480
it's going to buy me enough time
to get that weapon

874
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,233
and get back here
without tearing the plane apart.

875
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,309
Why are you doing this?

876
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,119
I made a promise to someone.

877
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,228
I keep my promises.

878
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,599
I have radar contact with Concord 239.

879
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,196
Should have visual in two minutes.

880
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,160
Burrows, in case this blows up
anything important,

881
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,991
do you mind
if I take out your new girlfriend?

882
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,396
Hey Bennett.

883
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,909
Got something for you.

884
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:15,075
Roger. Try to establish contact.
You have three minutes from my mark.

885
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,832
Mark minus three minutes.

886
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,200
Roger that.
Mark minus three minutes.

887
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,960
Try to establish contact.

888
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,791
I'm going to circle and signal.

889
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:24,995
Look.

890
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,553
I'd like to think
that's the Calvary, but um.

891
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,630
What do you mean?

892
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,953
We don't have much time.

893
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,360
Well, aren't they going to save us?

894
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,839
No. They're not going to save us.

895
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,600
There's just us.
Unless we let him know we're alive,

896
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,828
he's going to shoot us down.

897
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,040
They can't do that.

898
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,189
He's right.

899
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,953
Unless we answer them,
they're going to fire the missile at us.

900
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,953
What do we do?

901
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,189
We answer him.

902
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,032
Someone needs to get to the cockpit,
and signal that jet.

903
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,633
Does anybody know how to fly a jet?

904
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,195
Anyone? Anyone?

905
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,560
You can fly a jet?

906
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,520
Well, not officially.
But I know most of the basics.

907
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,396
Basics?

908
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,072
Of course, it's been awhile.

909
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,879
We just need to get to the radio and use it.

910
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,948
We need to go now, Frank.

911
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,440
Alright. Count me in.

912
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,351
No, no, no, Billy don't leave me.

913
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,280
I'll go. I'll go.

914
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,918
No. Stay here.

915
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,274
I'm going to do my part.

916
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,191
- Why?
- I'll see you soon, baby.

917
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,629
I'll see you soon.

918
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,470
Let's go.

919
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,314
Such a big mouth.

920
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,232
Nice drive.

921
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,590
Command, this is 431.

922
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,510
Go ahead.

923
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,955
239 has no one
in control that I can see.

924
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,555
Repeat, 239 has no one
in control that I can see.

925
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,829
Billy.

926
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,354
- Billy. Billy.
- Let her go.

927
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,230
Billy.

928
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:52,990
Billy.

929
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,879
Come on, baby.

930
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,873
You son of a bitch.

931
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,598
You don't know who you're dealing with.

932
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,274
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

933
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,110
Nah, nah, That's it for me.
You guys go.

934
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,156
You guys go. I've got to wait for Anna.

935
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,514
Go. Go.

936
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,157
No response to my signals.

937
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,390
You are clear to engage 239.

938
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,072
Command, please repeat.

939
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,480
You are clear to engage 239.

940
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,517
Roger that.
Clear to engage contact with 239.

941
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,276
Hold on, baby.

942
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:20,790
I love you.

943
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,718
I love you too, baby.

944
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,913
I always have.

945
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:36,875
Is that you Bennett?

946
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,513
Oh shit.

947
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,033
Come on mother fucker.

948
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,800
I want to make sure you keep
that shit eating grin on your face

949
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,153
all the way to hell.

950
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,269
Command, this is 431.

951
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,794
It appears
that engine number 3 is burning.

952
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,357
She's gumming me to death.

953
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,349
Go, go, go, go.

954
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,189
Where's the auto-pilot?

955
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,874
- I don't know. You asking me Frank?
- This is different.

956
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:12,757
This is different.

957
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,800
Don't yell at me.

958
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,074
I'm not yelling.

959
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,310
I have lock.

960
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,150
We're alive. I repeat we're alive.

961
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,276
Abort. Abort.

962
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,476
Missile away.

963
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,477
Incoming object. Incoming object.

964
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,400
They must have launched a missile.

965
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,320
Frank we got seconds.

966
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,754
- I know. Where is the auto-pilot?
- I don't know.

967
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,400
Collision imminent. Collision imminent.

968
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,360
Here, here.

969
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,160
Auto-pilot off.

970
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,071
What do I do?

971
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,469
- Ready.
- uh-huh

972
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,440
We got live civilians.

973
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,510
Aborting, repeat, I am aborting.

974
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,069
Pull up.

975
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,835
Pull up.

976
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,669
Pull up.

977
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,716
Pull up.

978
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,435
Pull up.

979
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,355
Pull up.

980
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,759
Hold on!

981
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,430
Jesus.

982
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,516
Pull up.

983
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,469
Pull up.

984
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,876
Pull up.

985
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,595
You did it, Frank.

986
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,555
Oh shit.

987
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:02,991
Frank.

988
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:04,880
Frank.

989
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:05,720
Yes.

990
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:06,835
Mountain.

991
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,315
Pull back.

992
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,071
Back.

993
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,032
Pull up. Pull up.

994
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,311
You did it my friend.

995
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,920
Did you ever consider going out
with an ex-cop?

996
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,593
I went out with a cop once.

997
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,156
Oh yeah?

998
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,797
Yeah, the only thing he was good
for was scratching my back

999
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:25,760
when I couldn't reach.

1000
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,354
Do you ever get that itch anymore?
