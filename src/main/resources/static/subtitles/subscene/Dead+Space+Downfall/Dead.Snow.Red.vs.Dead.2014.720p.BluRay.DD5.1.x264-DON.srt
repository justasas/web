Martin, can you hear me?

40
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:45,167
Hello, Martin.
Welcome back.

41
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,500
Martin, you crashed your car.

42
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,667
A nasty crash.
You are lucky to be alive.

43
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,250
There is more than one can say
about your friends.

44
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,917
Have you seen

45
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,750
Have you seen creatures?

46
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,875
The things

47
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:16,042
Have the police caught them?
Or the army?

48
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,083
Roy and Erlend?

49
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,958
- Hanna?
- We found friends. All of them.

50
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,125
Dead.
Hanna was your girlfriend, right?

51
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,708
Very beautiful.
We found her too.

52
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,167
With an ax driven into the neck.

53
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,917
And your fingerprints on the shaft.

54
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,875
Do you have any idea
how that could happen?

55
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,708
They came up from

56
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:52,583
From the snow. Creatures. Nazi.
We stuck, but

57
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,250
Nazis coming out of the ground?
Absurd.

58
00:09:56,417 --> 00:10:01,042
Are you sure
that he has brain damage?

59
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:07,083
Please call the family and say he is awakened.
Ask the Attorney send a car.

60
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,542
And four additional men. You are
ready to be transported.

61
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:15,208
They are out there yet. They will kill
again if we do not stop them.

62
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:19,708
We should not stop anyone.
I've seen what you've done.

63
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:25,125
- You'll be right in jail.
- No one knows what happened there.

64
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,167
Only you know that.
And it's not just bad news.

65
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:34,833
When we found you, you were badly injured.
Your right arm was torn across.

66
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,167
- It was not torn
- When we found you, it was cold.

67
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,750
The snow had chilled all,
and it was very good.

68
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:46,917
- And then we found the arm in the car.
- In the car?

69
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:51,792
It was slightly bruised and quite pale,
bit strange, basically, -

70
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,333
- But the operation was a success.

71
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,542
We managed to stick your arm again.

72
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,875
No, no, no

73
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,875
- It's not my arm.
- Relax.

74
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:24,917
It is Satan's arm!
It is Satan's arm!

75
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,500
Calm down.

76
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,667
No, it's not me!

77
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,250
No!

78
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,625
It's not me!
What the hell ...?

79
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,292
Stop!

80
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,375
Randi?

81
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,375
You need to settle down
removing the denture later.

82
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,667
Tonight I'm ready for a little hue.

83
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,208
From him that got away.

84
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:44,458
Nameless GERMAN SOLDIERS

85
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,792
Bakken.

00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,750
Warm.

87
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:45,208
The men have rotted.

88
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,875
We need more people.

89
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,000
Fittelås!

90
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,125
You scared me, Nils.

94
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,833

- And not a priest, of course

96
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,208
Nils?

97
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,250

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,917
yeah and how do we know it's for real??
i mean daniel thats a long way to go to find out if it's a hoax?

175
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,958
You saw the picture.

176
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,292
This is a bonifid infected arm, you know this.

177
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:44,583
All the signs are there guys

180
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:57,417

this is our chance to prove to everyone that we were right

181
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:02,625
i mean we've been telling everyone
for years that it's just a matter of time -

182
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:06,958
-before the first outbreak happens.
And what have seen in return?

183

00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:03,708
- Is completely idiotic.

Øksfjord?
It is not our district.

213
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:40,708
Martin Hykkerud
escaped from the hospital yesterday.

214
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:45,625
Martin Hykkerud? the guy who killed
his friends on top of the mountain?

215
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:51,000
Yes. He escaped yesterday and killed
a little boy and a policeman -

216
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,875
- By throwing a Mercedes star
in the face at him.

This is a war museum, right?

243

Yes.

244
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,792
Yes, and

245
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:42,667

251
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,958
- Do you have information about Einsatz?

252
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:18,542
- Second floor.
- Second floor.

253
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,042
Where the hell are you?

254
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,542
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

255
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:47,458
Buddy with Hitler.

256
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:51,875
- Nice, huh?
- Do not touch the exhibits.

257
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,042
"Herzog was made commander of Einsatz in 1942.

258
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:01,167
and was sent to the far north of norway
in order to protect the warships -

259
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,875
- that the German navy was hiding in the fjords.

260
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:12,000
He was on duty in Øksfjord doing a routine inspection on the ship
Scharnolsht, when

261
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,750
Scharnholst.

262
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:21,167
When Tirpitz, the German
fleets biggest warship, -

263
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:25,083
- Was attacked
by english bombers in Talvik -

264
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,417
- After getting vital information on the ships location
from norwegian spies.

265
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:34,458
Hitler, humiliated by the attack on Tirpitz
- ordered Herzog 

266
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:40,625
-to wipe out all the the 800
 men and people who lived in talvik at the time. "

267
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:46,417
Was he
He was on his way?

268
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:52,792
He was on his way to Talvik the evening
they were slaughtered in Øksfjord?

269
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,875
On behalf of Hitler.

270
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:05,750
A mission that was never completed.
It is. Exactly what is it.

271
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,917
They will destroy Talvik.

272
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,667
where

273
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:22,083
Herzog was going from Øksfjord -

274
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,458
- Which is here.

275
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,667
And he was going to talvik.

276
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,208
It's here.

277
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,250
Where are we now?

278
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,917
Where are we now?!

279
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,875
Here.

280
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,833
Isnestoften.

281
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:49,250
It is  in between.

282
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,583
(screaming outside)

283
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,208
They are recruiting!

284
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,500
They make new soldiers.
Can they do that? Fuck!

285
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,750
Okay, they come here.
There're coming now.

286
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:49,625
I will not die in a museum
with a guy in a green jogging suit.

287
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,417
Calm down.
You will die.

288
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,458
But relax.
Not today.

289
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,208
There!

290
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,917
Let see
what this thing can do.

291
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,917
What thing?

292
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,792
What did you do?
You killed them only with your hand

293
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:30,750
It's arm, man.

294
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:35,750
Before I could not control it,
but now makes it known what I think.

295
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:38,417
You're not even sweating.

296
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,167
Do not worry about it.

297
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:50,917
They build bigger.
Damn much larger.

298
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:54,000
There are too many
through the arm.

299
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,250
So much death.

300
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:27,417
All this unnecessary death.

301
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,917
(whimpering)

302
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,083
Fuck!

303
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,083
You did what he fucker
in the place. You just

304
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,500
- You
- No, it was the arm. It was the arm.

305
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,875
He does not attack

306
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,583
Did you see that?did you see that

307
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,042

318
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,458

We are more professional than this.

319
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:36,625

320
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:39,208
- You're the Zombie Squad?.
- Yeah, we are the zombie squad

321
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:43,417
i'm sorry.
I just expected something different.

322
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:47,792
so was this guy
when he woke up this morning.

323
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:52,500
Because I hit him in the face
with an ax.

324
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,083
- yeah how did you find me?
- we tracked your iphone, of course.

325
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,833
We're fucking nerds.
this is what we do technical shit, lets cut the chit chat

326
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,208
What did you find out?
What do the creatures want?

327
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,375
Revenge.

328
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:14,125
(engine noise)

329
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,958
this is insane!

330
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,292
You? you have the gift?

331
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:23,292
The force is strong with this one.

332
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:25,167
ok

333
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:33,583
Martin,
this is how we defeat them,
this is how we take them down

334
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,125
- What do you mean?
- I mean

335
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,708
We create an army of our own.

336
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,708
I tried to get as much infomation as i could on the trip over.

337
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:48,542
Especially about Herzog. To defeat
your enemy, you must know you enemy.

338
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:52,083
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
of the Soviet army.

339
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,750
Him and his battalion
was captured during the battle of Kursk.

340
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:58,750
and brought here to the north of norway as pow's.

341
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,417
In 1944 they were all sent
to Kvenang mountain  -

342
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:05,000
-to build a road through the mountain pass.

343
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:10,000
but it was after they built the road that shit got ugly.

344
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:15,625
All of the prisoners were shot.
Shot to death!

345
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,625
No survivors.

346
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:22,250
And the man in charge

347
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:24,167
Herzog.

348
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,667
Those bodies are still buried there.

349
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:33,500
Buried in the frozen soil.
Preserved, waiting.

350
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:40,208
-  waiting for what?
- for he same thing that drives Herzog.

351
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:44,875
Revenge. 
-and guess who's gonna
give it to them.

352
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,917
- the man who can raise the dead?
- kerfuckin ...!

353
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:55,875
you guys go after Herzog try and slow him down,
give us as much time as possible. ok?

354
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:58,750
- And what if this doesnt work?
- It has too.

355
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:02,250
all we have to do is get to Kvenang mountain,
find stavarin wake him back from the dead -

356
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:05,875
- then bring him back to Talvik
so he can help us fight Herzog and his men.

357
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:09,333
Lett. Besides

358
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:13,708
we got help.

359
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:21,000
here we go.

360
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,167
He is our last hope.

361
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,625
look, a tank.

362
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:07,667
(a sound from outside)

363
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:11,500
- a Visitor now?
- It's early.

364
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:28,000
(sound)

365
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,875
Hello?

366
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,875
(baby crying)

367
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,708
Look,
his army is growing bigger.

368
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:46,250
glenn are there more towns or villages 
before he reaches talvik

369
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:51,208
- maybe a few houses but thats it
- Good. so what he has now he'll use for his attack.

370
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:55,833
yeah pretty much
that is untill he starts dealing with people of Talvik bekim and journhim as well.

371
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,250
- How many people live in talvik?
- about 3000.

372
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:03,375
- Holy shit!
- all the more reason for us to slow them down as much as we can.

373
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:10,292
- look do you know how to use one of those things?
- of course.  I'm from northern Norway arent i.

374
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:14,000
I dont know what that means, ok
guys pack light.

375
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:16,708
we're moving out, now!

376
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:25,958
What the deepest in hell
happened here?

377
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:28,875
What do engineers?

378
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:32,833
It is not technical,
Only Tom and Ole in a white coat.

379
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,333
The thought
so a little more professionally out.

380
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:40,500
NCIS should be herein night.

381
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:45,208
- Do we have any witnesses?
- If you get the seagulls to chat happily.

382
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,833
Gulls, yes.
Then you have a damn good invention.

383
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
A gadget that translates
seagull language to human language.

384
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:56,417
He who finds a way
will be fucking rich.

385
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:59,833
Get the bodies out of Talvik
before the gulls eat them up.

386
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,125
And take  pictures, otherwise
NCIS will cut off my balls.

387
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:09,083
Here are pictures
from the surveillance camera.

388
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,625
Is not that where ...?

389
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:22,333
To me at the head of guttefitta mi.

390
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:30,458
Okay, guys, guys!
We are in a hurry. Come on!

391
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,250
Come on, man!
We have things to do!

392
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,875
There they are.
And they have a tank i see.

393
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:41,833
Yes, they stole it from the museum.

394
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,417
ah Fuck!

395
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:50,208
- What is that?
- A large-ass tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

396
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:53,125
No,no,no,no,no
That. What is that?

397
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:57,958
oh these are replica's of the binoculars
Han and Chewie used on the planet Hoth.

398
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:02,208
Did you guys know ...fun fact all of the hoth scenes,
-sssshhhhhh

399
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:06,500
- Were filmed here in Norway.
this place called Finse.

400
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:11,708
girls Could we please maybe focus on you know the Nazi zombies instead?

401
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:16,375
- What do we do?
- well Daniel told us to slow them down, so thats what we're gonna do.

402
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:18,333
Look.

403
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:23,708
We need to get out there,
get their attention and then lure them into the swamps, right?

404
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:29,167
And then when they get stuck, 
we can use the fertilizer bombs we made and blow them into bits and pieces.

405
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,583
thats sounds basically impossible.

406
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,500
And how were you planning on luring them out there?
We need bait. Live bait.

407
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:39,125
yes we need someone to attract their attention, 

408
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:42,125
someOne who is light on their feet.

409
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:47,042
 who knows these swamps
and can move through them without getting stuck.

410
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:54,917
What?

411
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,792
No.

412
00:54:56,958 --> 00:55:00,000
No.

414
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:07,333
-  are fucking zombies

415
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,458

416
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:14,208

417
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:19,125

418
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:25,208
- With long hair and big breasts.

419
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:29,708

and we'll do the rest. Capeesh?

420
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:41,625

yeah yeah.

423
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,958
First, we wake up a battalion of Nazi zombies -

424
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:56,208
- And now I'm supposed to wake up a bunch of dead russian guys


425
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:59,208

426
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:03,417

take down Herzog at this point remember that.

427
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,667
if we dont succeed -

428
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:10,625

443
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:29,667
no no it's ok we got their attention,

OMG, Blake!

454
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:52,500
USA, USA!

455
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,708
USA!

456
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:58,958
Shoot.

457
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,458
Hey. that tank is moving.

458
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,500
that cant be good.

459
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,625
Run!

460
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,042
Run!

461
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:49,625
oh My God!

462
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,542
Talvik. Now.

463
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,333
Hey.

464
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,458
- Where are we?
- We're getting close.

465
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,833
But we're also stuck.

466
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:27,250
- Can I push it?
- I dont, i dont think that will help.

467
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:31,875
- Is it far? We could walk.
- We dont have that kind of time.

468
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,000
i mean If only we could find something -

469
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:41,167
- to put under the car you know
something that would give us traction.

470
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:44,083
Then I could get us out of here.

471
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,917
(whimpering scared)

472
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,042
- There you are, yes.
- Satan lives to accommodate all equal.

473
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:42,917
The dress is absolutely stuffed full.
We had to throw the rest in the garage.

474
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:46,583
- Sounds like a perfect solution.
- Thank you.

475
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:52,708
Most Germans and French.
Hardly the vacation they envisioned.

476
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:56,542
To get worn off his head and arms
and get entrails torn out?

477
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,417
Unless they like that kind of kinky stuff.

478
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:07,667
- Should you do that?
- No.

479
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:10,917
- Should not NCIS been here now?
- It gave a lot in Alta.

480
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:15,208
The plane could not land.
They are here in the morning, they say.

481
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:21,250
- It's perfect.
- What?

482
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,167
It's our chance.

483
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:29,125
Now, we fucking show people
what we're made of here.

484
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:34,000
We here at Talvik Police
find Martin Hykkerud itself.

485
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:38,375
We get him. Vi.
We will be heroes.

486
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,500
Not the goddamn suit-clad,
homofriserte -

487
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:46,083
- Sushi-eating hestkukene south.

488
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:49,208
Beef boys

489
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:54,542
Brief guys. Send photos to
all gossips throughout Talvik.

490
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:59,417
He stops to pee, I
Knowing the color and smell of urine.

491
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:03,583
- Odor and color.
- And make ready their weapons.

492
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,250
Now we shoot anything other than gulls,
for once.

493
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:15,000
Do you really
think this is going to  work?

494
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:20,000
I mean,
say we actually manage to wake these russians back to life .

495
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:23,000
Whats stopping them from killing us?

496
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:29,000
I dont know whats gonna happen.
But judging based on him -

497
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:33,083
- he treats you like you're his master,
so hopefully they'll do the same.

498
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,208
Hopefully.

499
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:39,333
look I dont know man
this is some unprecedented unheard of -

500
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:44,542
- Mysterious voodoo zombie shit man 
I've never seen this before.

501
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:50,042
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not in any of them.

502
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:54,000
You have created a whole new genre here man.

503
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:58,500
look i mean if we're gonna go up against a battalion of 
Nazi zombies -

504
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:02,500
-we could do a whole lot worse than 
teaming up with a battlion of russian zombies.

505
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:09,000
He has to die you know?. Herzog.

506
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:12,792
For what he did.
We have to kill him.

507
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:18,333
I have to  kill him.
For Hanna.

508
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:24,833
- this it is.
- Yeah.

509
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,375
this is definitely it.

510
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:35,042
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

511
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:39,875
So they've got to be buried in this frozen ground.
.

512
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,125
how we do this?

513
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,042
we do it just like you did  -

514
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,958
- with him.

515
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,792
I put my hand on his head.

516
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:55,542
Okay. Right.

517
01:06:57,417 --> 01:07:00,083
we cant dig up everyone it will take weeks.

518
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:04,500
You have to wake them up,
 one way or another.

519
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:31,167
Lord.

520
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:39,042
f**k yeah!

521
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,542
He was first seen here.

522
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,958
In Øksfjord.

523
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:24,792
And next time here.
Museum at lsnestoften.

524
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:29,375
So it looks as if
he's heading south. Perhaps there.

525
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,333
We have a problem.

526
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:38,167
A gang dressed as Germans
going bananas out there?

527
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:41,375
Bananas?
They killed loads of different people.

528
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:46,333
We have not had a murder since 74,
and suddenly there Ragnarok.

529
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:52,083
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shoot first, ask later!

530
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:40,833
There is no one here.
We have showed them the door.

531
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,208
They are gone.

532
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:48,708
Since you can not complete the mission, -

533
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:53,375
- You can just turn
and go back to your snow cave.

534
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:25,292
Some have grown a bit since last time.
Been a little bigger.

535
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:32,458
I also taught a couple of buddies
the dance.

536
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:21,417
Is  it not a bit sour
when you thought someone was dead -

537
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:24,458
- Coming back to kill you?

538
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:53,875
Let's kill them.

539
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:55,458
Troops!

540
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,250
Attack!

541
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,833
Let's kill them all!

542
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:21,958
What the hell is going on here?
Is the carnival in town?

543
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,667
 they have tanks?

544
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,417
- Damn!
- Run!

545
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,167
Help!

546
01:16:58,083 --> 01:17:00,542
Daniel! tank.

547
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,375
- Should not we help them?
- Help who?

548
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:21,542
Those with blemishes in german uniform
or those with blemishes in Russian?

549
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:53,208
<i> okay </ i>

550
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,000
Good boy.

551
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:24,125
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!
- What the hell's going on?

552
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,542
Do as hell.
Looks like a video game.

553
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:30,167
look Martin Hykkerud!

554
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:33,583
- Yes!
- Should we take him?

555
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:37,083
No, no.
Wait until it calms down.

556
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,750
this is tactical policing.

557
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,417
Zombie Squad. It's about time!

558
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,958
- thats a long story.
- There was a tank.

559
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:14,458
And guy took my jacket.

560
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:19,625
- looks like you found Stavarin and his men i see.
- Yeah but there's still more them than us .

561
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,625
i guess it's time we even out the odds a bit huh.

562
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,250
guys! We're losing!

563
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,292
look!

564
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:16,042
shit!

565
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,083
No, no, no

566
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,333
No!

567
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,583
Wait!

568
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:43,583
We have to kill him!

569
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:46,458
They're all bound to him like the russians are to you 
.

570
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:49,708
If he dies, the others will too .

571
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,458
lets finish this.

572
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,458
<i> Untermensch. </ i>

573
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:18,833
 guys come on.
No seat belts?

574
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,208
You just asking for it.

575
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:53,958
fuckin hell how many more of these are there?

576
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,917
Is this it?

577
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:06,542
Monica, is this how it's gonna end?

578
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,417
No, no.

579
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,750
- we're gonna die now?
- No.

580
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:16,250
Fuck it.

581
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,958
fuck it i'm just gonna say it.
-what?

582
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,083
I, -

583
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:26,042
- Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, is

584
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,708
No!

585
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,625
- Blake!
- Glenn?

586
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,292
Monica ..

587
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:44,917
Why did not you just
stay on the mountain?

588
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:54,542
You got's what you should have.
You got the gold.

589
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,917
But it was not enough.

590
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:06,833
You were greedy.

591
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,083
wanted more.

592
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,167
Blake

593
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,500
- Monica
- watch out!

594
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:22,292
- Monica!
- Blake!

595
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,625
Blake! No!

596
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:42,458
That's why you lost.

597
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:46,000
Because you were greedy.

598
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:54,500
You know you lost the war?

599
01:28:56,292 --> 01:28:58,917
Lost everything.

600
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,542
ridiculed.

601
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:06,042
Pathetic.

602
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,917
And you know what?

603
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,583
You lose again.

604
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,375
No!

605
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,292
My God!

606
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,292
He did it!

607
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:48,583
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked. I knew it.

608
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:52,417
Herzog is dead.

609
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:54,833
He is dead. Yes!

610
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:13,083
that was close.

611
01:30:24,917 --> 01:30:28,333
You did it!
You killed Herzog?

612
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:32,750
i cant believe that that actually worked.

613
01:30:32,917 --> 01:30:35,583
Of course it did.

614
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,542
you doubted the Zombie Squad?

615
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:42,708
Kenneth Glenn, is he ...?

616
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:47,208
He didnt make it.

617
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:02,375
It's been a true honor
killing zombies with you guys.

618
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,125
you too martin.

619
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,958
What is it? Okay.

620
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:17,833
- You can say it.
- go for it.

621
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:23,875
May the force be with you.

622
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:31,375
Really? That one?
Of all the ...? You chose that one?

623
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:35,667
theres like a million to choose from,
why would you choose that one?

624
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:03,125
- Where the hell are they?
- I know as hell.

625
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:07,042
Hell too! Bjarne!

626
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,250
Are you in a coma?

627
01:32:10,417 --> 01:32:12,792
Go and find them, dammit!

628
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:21,875
I would resolve this matter.
Do not end with a hundred new corpses.

629
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:27,083
Where do we fit it all?
The garage and the freezer is packed.

630
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,500
I do not know! I do not know.

631
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:41,625
The gulls again. They've not
eaten so well since the war.

632
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:47,250
We should have
the damn machine.

633
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:50,667
Whoever translates
seagull language to human language.

634
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:54,500
Then we would fuck me
Jack the matter as an egg.

635
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:57,542
As an egg.

636
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,875
(groan)
