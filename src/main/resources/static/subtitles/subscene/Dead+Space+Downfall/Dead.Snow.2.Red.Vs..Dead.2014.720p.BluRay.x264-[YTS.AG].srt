1
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:51,884
It all started out so nice.

2
00:00:57,042 --> 00:01:00,792
A bunch of kids going
to a cabin in the mountains.

3
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,207
Drinking, laughing,

4
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,631
having fun.

5
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,959
And then a horde of
Nazi zom bies shows up.

6
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:14,752
I know.

6
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:19,252
Sounds like a cliche,
but that's what happened.

7
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,827
You see, we found something...

8
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,129
something we shouldn't have.

9
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,709
Old Nazi gold.

10
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:36,419
And then...

11
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,464
all hell broke loose.

12
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,629
They took us out...

13
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:54,751
one...

14
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,669
...by one.

15
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:03,384
One of them bit me,

16
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,084
but I knew how to fix that.

17
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,327
And my girlfriend,

18
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,794
Hanna.

19
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:21,626
She...

20
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:25,786
She didn't make it.

21
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,829
I found the gold...

22
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:33,504
gave it back...

23
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,214
and I was free to go.

24
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:44,584
I was safe.

25
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:07,876
Turns out...

26
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,542
I was wrong.

27
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,999
Take your fucking coin!

28
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:13,834
Crawl back to the hell
you came from! Huh?

29
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:22,959
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit,

30
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:22,964
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...
Shit, Shit, Shit, Shit,

31
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:25,789
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

32
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,422
Okay. Okay. Okay.

33
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,249
Fuck.

34
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,206
I told them not to touch that shrine.

35
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,747
Radio.

36
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,882
Always something good on the radio.

37
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,167
The Arctic Tern is a sea bird

39
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,497
of the Tern family Sternidae.

40
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,754
The species is strongly migratory,

41
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:56,626
seeing two summers each year,

42
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:56,631
as it migrates from
its northern breeding grounds
seeing two summers each year,

43
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,996
as it migrates from
its northern breeding grounds

44
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,041
along a winding route

45
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:04,542
to the oceans
around Antarctica and back,

46
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,832
a round trip of about 70,000...

47
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:12,461
The Tern flies as well as glides...

48
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,829
Troops...

49
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,884
Sieg Heil!

50
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:37,326
- Doctor?
- Yes.

51
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:45,497
Oh, good.

52
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,002
Let's see what we got here.

53
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,166
Martin, can you hear me?

54
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,417
Martin, are you there?

55
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:54,502
Welcome back.

56
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,749
Martin, you crashed your car.

57
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,447
Badly.

58
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,286
You're lucky to be alive.

59
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,084
More than you can say about your friends.

60
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:11,924
Did you see them?

61
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,084
The things?

62
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:17,036
The creatures?

63
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,672
Did the police take them?

64
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:24,789
Or the Army?

65
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,287
Erlend?

66
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,537
Roy?

67
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,327
Hanna?

68
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,922
We found your friends. All of them.

69
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:36,834
Dead.

70
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:39,964
Hanna, is that your girlfriend?

71
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:44,666
We found her too,
with an ax jammed into her throat.

72
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,917
With your fingerprints all over it.

73
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,254
Any idea how that happened?

74
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:54,286
The things...

75
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:58,211
They came up... came from up...

76
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,459
from the snow.

77
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,249
Nazis. I had an ax, and I...

78
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,881
So little Nazi creatures
came up from the earth?

79
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:08,381
Are you certain he didn't
suffer any brain damage?

80
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,999
Okay, call his family,
tell them he's awake,

81
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,791
and get the DA, tell him to send a car

82
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,791
and four extra guys, out of here.

83
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:21,334
They will kill again if we don't stop...

84
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,714
Martin, Martin, Martin, Martin.

85
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,959
Calm down. I've seen what you've done.

86
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,169
I was there.

87
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,877
The only place you're going is jail.

88
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:32,206
Nobody knows exactly
what happened up there.

89
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,169
Only you do.

90
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,381
Besides, it's not only bad news.

91
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,334
When we found you, you were hurt.

92
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:43,254
Your right arm was ripped off by the elbow.

93
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,831
- Yeah, I...
- It was cold when we found you.

94
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,084
The snow kept you cool, which was good.

95
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:49,792
You understand?

96
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,169
And so, we found your arm in the car.

97
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:56,667
Yeah, it was a bit bruised and pale,

98
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,959
but the operation was a success.

99
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,879
We managed to put your arm right back on.

100
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,749
Huh?

101
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:23,959
What have you done?

102
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,287
What have you done?

103
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,502
Please calm down, my friend.
Martin, please...

104
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:30,001
This is Satan's arm!

105
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,879
Martin, calm down, please.

106
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:36,581
Hey, hey!

107
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:00,247
I'm so... It is not me!
It's not... I'm sorry!

108
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:01,794
I'm sorry! Stop it!

109
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:00,876
Emma?

110
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:06,541
I think you have to remove
your teeth tonight,

111
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:09,961
'cause I'm in the mood for some head.

112
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,957
From the one that got away.

113
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,582
The ground.

114
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,964
Warm.

115
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,127
The men...

116
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:53,171
have rotted.

117
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:58,327
We need more people.

118
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,629
Ah, Jesus!

119
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:28,956
You scared me, Nils.

120
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:32,669
I'm telling you, I'm not
in the mood for this.

121
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,287
I had a long day today.

122
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:37,667
Two funerals and two weddings.

123
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:41,499
And one of the girls getting married
today she was so fucking hot.

125
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,129
What I wouldn't give
to be 15 years younger,

126
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:46,749
and, yeah, not a priest, of course.

127
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,422
Nils?

128
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,462
Sieg...

129
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,129
Heil.

130
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:58,792
Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil,

131
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:03,212
Sieg Heil,

132
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:08,497
<i>Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil...</i>

133
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,544
They're down from the mountain.

134
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,632
They're gonna kill us all.

135
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,462
Fuck!

136
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:25,882
Hey!

137
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,924
They're down from the mountain!

138
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,247
Get me the fuck out of here!

139
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:32,714
Get me out!

140
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,712
They're coming!

141
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,291
They're gonna kill us all!

142
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,459
They're gonna kill us all!

143
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:47,882
Psst! Hey! Hey, you.

144
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,039
Psst! Yeah, you.

145
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:53,786
Hello.

146
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:58,666
I saw your arm. Looks really cool.

147
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,379
Took some pictures, too.

148
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,541
Looks sick, but still cool.

149
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:05,739
I'm not supposed to be in here, but...

150
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:07,832
I snuck in here like a ninja.

151
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:09,921
- Ninja?
- Yeah.

152
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:13,749
Oh, I'm Bobby.

153
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,831
I'm here on vacation with my mom.

154
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,714
She ate some bad fish
yesterday, so, yeah...

155
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:23,042
Hmm. Cool. Seriously cool.

156
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:27,416
It looks burned and old,

157
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,957
like a zombie arm.

158
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:30,329
Zombies are cool.

159
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,037
Zombies?

160
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,579
Sorry, gotta take this.

161
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:38,334
They're wondering if I
can get some more info.

162
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,834
More than just a picture of the arm.

163
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,504
Who? What?

164
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,417
The Zombie Squad.

165
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,127
They're wondering if I
can get some more info.

166
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,876
They're experts on zombies.
They live in America.

167
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:51,496
They've trained for this for years,

168
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,291
just waiting for a
zombie outbreak to happen.

169
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,542
So they can come here?

170
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:57,671
Just tell them to come here
right now to get the zombies!

171
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,707
If they're experts,
they can kill the zombies for us.

172
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:01,421
- I know. You've seen the zombies?
- Yeah.

173
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,882
- 'Cause they're real, right?
- Yeah.

174
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,537
- Yeah.
- Can you help me get loose?

175
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:07,331
I'm not sure if I should. I mean, you're...

176
00:21:11,084 --> 00:21:12,754
- I have chocolate.
- You do?

177
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,044
- Yeah.
- Nice.

178
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:15,332
Yeah, I have chocolate.

179
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:17,922
'Cause I could get it for you,
but, you know...

180
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,497
- Yeah.
- So...

181
00:21:20,334 --> 00:21:22,134
- Double-triple fudge.
- Oh, my God!

182
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,036
Yeah.

183
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,961
Let me get this right here...

184
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,672
Come, come, come! You can do it.

185
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,787
Come on. Yeah.

186
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,674
Help me with the other.

187
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:45,334
- Can I have my chocolate now?
- There's no chocolate, kid.

188
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,464
- No chocolate?
- Shut the fuck up!

189
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,579
What?

190
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:53,792
I gotta get out.

191
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,131
What are you...

192
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:06,707
Hey!

193
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,327
It's not what it looks like.

194
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:15,632
Stop!

195
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:10,792
Hello?

196
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,997
This is Daniel Heffernan,
leader of the Zombie Squad.

197
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,831
Can I please speak to Bobby?

198
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,214
Bobby, uh...

199
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,042
Bobby, uh.

200
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,541
I don't speak the language of Thor.

201
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:25,746
- Is Bobby there?
- Bobby was killed by zombies.

202
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:27,929
My God!

203
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,827
Is this the Zombie Squad?

204
00:24:30,834 --> 00:24:32,214
That is a 10-4, Martin.

205
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,959
We will be heading your way shortly.

206
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:37,999
Before we go, we need as much
information as you can give us.

207
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,041
Anything you have.

208
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:40,746
Well...

209
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:47,419
We came up to the cabin
and there was a bunch of...

210
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,634
Nazi zombies there, and...

211
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:55,044
You know, they killed us all, and...

212
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,542
Except me. Yeah, and...

213
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:01,456
I sawed my arm off, but it's...

214
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,876
Yeah, the arm is... And...

215
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:07,996
I think they wanted treasure,
or a coin, and...

216
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,501
Were any of you bitten?

217
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:10,957
We were all bitten.

218
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:15,076
But we didn't become
one of them, we just...

219
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:20,502
We just died, so...

220
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:25,461
Listen Martin. And listen good.

221
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,499
These are not your classic,
textbook zombies

222
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:31,291
just hungering to feast
on the flesh of man.

223
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:34,082
No, these are most likely
cursed zombies,

224
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:37,214
awakened to reclaim something
that was stolen from them,

225
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,879
or to complete a task given to them.

226
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,916
They called him Herzog. They...

227
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,834
They called him Herzog.

228
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,169
Martin of the North,

229
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,079
we will be on our way shortly.

230
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:53,542
And we will take care of this infection.

231
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:56,714
We are professionals. But until then,

232
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,329
find out what they seek, their purpose.

233
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:01,957
Bye.

234
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,131
Zombie Squad.

235
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:14,037
Zombie Squad is coming. They'll be...

236
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:16,076
They're professionals.

237
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:18,544
Okay, girls.

238
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:22,082
Looks like we're going to Norway.

239
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:28,834
Norway?

240
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:30,576
We can't go to Norway.

241
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:32,294
That's on the other side of the world!

242
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:35,666
Yeah, and how do we know it's for real?

243
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:38,537
Daniel, that's a long way to go
to find out if it's a hoax.

244
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:39,922
You guys saw the picture.

245
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:42,134
This is a bona fide infected arm.

246
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,706
You know this. This is...

247
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,707
All the signs are there, guys.

248
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:48,039
The decayed skin, the rotten hair,
the dark blood.

249
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:49,672
This is real, guys. It's real.

250
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,127
This could be dangerous!

251
00:26:51,129 --> 00:26:53,126
No shit. It's fucking zombies!

252
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:55,126
Of course it'll be dangerous!

253
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:57,246
But this is what we've been waiting for.

254
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:01,001
This is our chance to prove
to everyone that we were right.

255
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:03,751
We've been telling everyone for years

256
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,501
that it's just a matter of time

257
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:08,286
before the first outbreak happens.

258
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,629
And what have we seen in return?

259
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:11,709
Laughter.

260
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:13,884
Ridicule.

261
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:16,964
Wedgies.

262
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:20,419
Well...

263
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,287
Guess who was right?

264
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:25,924
Guess who's laughing now?

265
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,077
- I guess we're laughing now.
- You're damn right, we are!

266
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:32,134
What did we start the Zombie Squad
for if it wasn't for this?

267
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,167
- He's right.
- Damn right, I'm right.

268
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,167
Besides, if we don't do this,

269
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,627
if we don't go there and help these people,

270
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:41,294
who the hell will?

271
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,419
Yeah.

272
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,629
- So what do we do?
- Yes!

273
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,541
Okay. We need as much information

274
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,132
as we can get on this Herzog character,

275
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:54,996
on Martin, the north of Norway, everything.

276
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,041
Oh, wait, hold on!

277
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:58,879
Guys, we can't let our
landlords know about this.

278
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:01,206
- You mean our parents?
- Yes, our parents, but...

279
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:04,382
- We just can't tell them what's happening.
- Got it.

280
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:08,247
All right. Official members
of the Zombie Squad USA...

281
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:09,671
Oh, my God!

282
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:11,749
It's time to go hunting.

283
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,044
That was farther than usual!

284
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:51,827
I poured you a coffee.

285
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:58,382
- Hell, this is cold!
- Because you're 40 minutes late.

286
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:01,376
I'm still on wintertime.
The winter time, summer time system...

288
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:03,582
is stupid.

289
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:05,922
What do you got?

290
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:10,039
Not much. Petra's son
been at it again, shoplifting.

291
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,792
Just do what they do in Iran.
Cut his hands off.

292
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:14,916
That will teach him.

293
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:19,001
And Jack's dog is on the loose again.
He pooped in Mr. Olsen's yard.

295
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:21,171
- Shoot him.
- Shoot Mr. Olsen?

296
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,077
Not Mr. Olsen. The dog!

297
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,964
Otherwise, we have
the lecture at the school

298
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,999
about the dangers of smoking marijuana.

299
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:30,131
Oh. Boring!

300
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:32,834
Oh, there was one other thing.

301
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:34,084
From Oxfjord.

302
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,884
Oxfjord? No, no, no, no, no.

303
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,206
That's not our jurisdiction.

304
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,997
Martin Hykkerud,
escaped from the hospital...

305
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:42,041
Whoa, wait.

306
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:43,416
Martin Hykkerud?

307
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,582
Is that the same Martin Hykkerud that

308
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,334
killed his friends up in the mountains?

309
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,134
He escaped from the hospital yesterday,

310
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,292
killed a kid and a policeman by, um...

312
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:56,999
throwing a Mercedes star into his face.

313
00:29:57,001 --> 00:29:59,751
- He cut off a Mercedes star?
- Yeah.

314
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:02,207
- What does Oslo say?
- About the Mercedes star?

315
00:30:02,209 --> 00:30:05,039
Not the Merced... The Hykkerud case!

316
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,579
They said to stay alert,
get in extra people,

317
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:10,964
and keep it tight
until they send a team up.

318
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:13,376
Ah, "extra people." Hmm.

319
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:14,826
Do we have the money? No, we don't.

320
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:17,882
I don't even have money
to buy new batteries to the car.

321
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:22,171
Okay. Okay.

322
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:26,382
- Uh...
- What?

324
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,464
Didn't we agree to be more
casual around here?

325
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:38,129
Okay, go.

326
00:30:44,084 --> 00:30:45,924
My God!

327
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:48,711
I was expecting something
like the Hoth-systems,

328
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,379
but this is more like Endor.

329
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:53,076
Monica, can you reference anything
other than Star Wars?

330
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,214
What, like Star Trek?
Maybe if I can't sleep.

331
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,419
Yeah, at least it's based on
scientific theories

332
00:30:57,427 --> 00:31:00,254
- and a dog isn't running a starship.
- Guys, guys! I have a lock on Martin.

334
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:01,417
- Oh.
- Where is he?

335
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,577
Ice Bay.

336
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:05,831
- Ooh. Okay, let's go! Come on!
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

338
00:31:06,501 --> 00:31:08,751
First, there's something we need to do.

339
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:10,541
Oh, yeah, I really have to pee.

340
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:11,962
- No, guys!
- I'm hungry.

341
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:14,286
- Arm up.
- Oh.

342
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:16,076
- You really fuckin' ruined that.
- Yeah.

343
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,287
It would be a lot easier
if you could buy weapons here.

344
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:17,004
I know. What the fuck's
the matter with this country?

345
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,582
Can I help you?

346
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:11,079
No, I'm sorry.
Just, uh... Just...

347
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:13,794
Back away, please.
I like you. Like you.

348
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,127
This is a war museum, right?

349
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:36,131
Yeah.

350
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:39,076
Do you have information on the Germans?

351
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:45,997
Help! Help me!

352
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,746
Listen to me! Listen!

353
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,711
Please don't hurt me, I have two kittens.

354
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,919
Help me! Help!

355
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,041
Shut... Shut up!

356
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:58,957
Do you have any information on "Einsatz"?

357
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:03,334
Yeah. Second floor.

358
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:04,997
Show me.

359
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,331
Where are you?

360
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:21,334
Fuck.

361
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:24,004
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

362
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:32,974
Best buddies with Hitler.

363
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:34,584
Isn't that cute?

364
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,247
You're not supposed to touch the display.

365
00:35:41,001 --> 00:35:43,831
Herzog was made commander
of Einsatz in 1942

366
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,794
and sent to the far north of Norway

367
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:48,042
in order to protect the warships that

368
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:50,714
the German Navy was hiding in the fjords.

369
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:55,131
He was on duty in Oxfjord
doing a routine inspection

370
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,826
on the ship Scharnolsht, when...

371
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,424
Scharnholst.

372
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,171
...when Tirpitz,

373
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,787
the German fleet's biggest warship,
was attacked...

374
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:11,792
by English bombers in Talvik,

375
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:15,044
after getting vital information
on the ship's location

376
00:36:15,062 --> 00:36:16,882
from Norwegian spies.

377
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,957
Hitler, humiliated by
the attack on Tirpitz,

378
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,829
ordered Herzog to wipe out

379
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,044
all of the 800 men and people

380
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:26,212
who lived in Talvik at the time.

381
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:31,131
So, he was on his way...

382
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:33,576
to Talvik...

383
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,709
that night when and his men

384
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,999
were butchered down in Oxfjord?

385
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,667
On a mission given
to them by Hitler, himself.

386
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,537
Yeah.

387
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,827
A mission that was never accomplished.

388
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,286
He's going to destroy Talvik.

389
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,422
He came from Oxfjord.

390
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:09,291
Here.

391
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:11,997
Going to Talvik.

392
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:13,884
Talvik is here.

393
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:15,924
Where are we?

394
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,747
Where are we?!

395
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,251
We're here.

396
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:23,876
Ice Bay.

397
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:30,792
That means...

398
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,462
That's just in-between.

399
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:19,077
They're recruiting.

400
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,917
They're recruiting new zombies.

401
00:39:23,001 --> 00:39:24,501
They can do that too, now?

402
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,126
- They're coming here.
- I don't want to die.

403
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:31,001
I don't want to die here in a museum!

404
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,331
With you!

405
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,457
You're gonna die.

406
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:37,674
But not today.

407
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,497
Jesus.

408
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,291
Let's see what this thing can do.

409
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:37,827
What thing?

410
00:42:02,626 --> 00:42:04,746
What you do...? How did you do that?

411
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,754
You just... killing all of them...

412
00:42:06,876 --> 00:42:09,496
You didn't even break a sweat? Jesus.

413
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:10,582
It's the arm.

414
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,707
Somehow, I'm controlling it.

415
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,996
It reacts to what I'm thinking.

416
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,631
What arm? What are you talking about?

417
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,786
It's Satan's arm.

418
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:22,246
It's a long story.

419
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:28,542
He's building an army.

420
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:30,921
It's growing in numbers.

421
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:37,579
There'll be too many.
Even with the arm, I can't...

422
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:01,004
All this death.

423
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:41,292
- You...
- He...

424
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:42,459
- You did that!
- He was...

425
00:43:42,626 --> 00:43:44,916
You did what the bastard did earlier.

426
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:46,667
I...

427
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,132
It's the arm.

428
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:19,206
He's not attacking.

429
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:34,247
Did you see that?
Did you see that? I hit it!

430
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:37,712
I hit it! Oh, my God, I did it,
I fucking did it!

431
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:39,004
I hit it right in the eye!

432
00:44:39,006 --> 00:44:42,331
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Take a picture, please.

433
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,504
Take of picture of me.

434
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:45,496
First Zombie Squad kill.

435
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,171
One, two...

436
00:44:47,209 --> 00:44:48,289
Cheese.

437
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:51,132
Did you get it?

438
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:54,504
Oh. We spoke on the phone.

439
00:44:54,506 --> 00:44:56,791
I'm Daniel, this is Blake and Monica.

440
00:44:56,992 --> 00:44:58,962
- Hi.
- We are the Zombie Squad.

441
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,674
- Goddammit.
- They're real.

442
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:05,752
These are real dead people.

443
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:08,331
And that's a real zombie. You killed him.

444
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,537
I can't believe it.

445
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,502
Can we just focus for one second, guys?

446
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:15,541
I'm so sorry. We are more
professional than this.

447
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:19,292
- You're the Zombie Squad?
- Yup.

448
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,167
- Yeah.
- You're the Zombie Squad.

449
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,497
Yeah, we are the Zombie Squad.

450
00:45:22,501 --> 00:45:23,961
Yeah, I'm sorry. I was...

451
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:26,629
just expecting something different.

452
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:29,957
So was this guy when he
woke up this morning!

453
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:34,961
Because I hit him in the face with an ax.

454
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,174
Yeah. How did you find me?

455
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,457
We tracked your iPhone, of course.

456
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:41,879
We're fuckin' nerds.
This is what we do. Technical shit.

457
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,577
Let's cut the chitchat.
What did you find out?

458
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:47,039
What do the creatures want?

459
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,499
Revenge.

460
00:46:56,376 --> 00:46:59,246
This is insane!

461
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,867
You?

462
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:03,514
You have the gift?

463
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:06,834
The force is strong with this one.

464
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:07,714
Okay...

465
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:14,922
Martin, this is how we defeat them.

466
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:16,377
This is how we take them down.

467
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:17,996
What do you mean?

468
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:19,751
I mean...

469
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:23,499
We create an army of our own.

470
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:27,922
I tried to get as much information
as I could on the trip over.

472
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:29,626
Especially about Herzog.

473
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:32,037
To defeat your enemy,
you must know your enemy.

474
00:47:32,251 --> 00:47:35,671
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
of the Soviet Army.

475
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,327
He and his battalion were captured

476
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,294
during the battle of Kursk,

477
00:47:39,298 --> 00:47:42,252
And brought here to
the north of Norway as POWS.

478
00:47:42,261 --> 00:47:46,291
In '44, they were all
sent to Kven Mountain

479
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:48,422
to build a road through
the mountain pass,

480
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,964
but it was after they built
the road that shit got ugly.

482
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:56,537
All of the prisoners were shot.

483
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,167
Shot to death!

484
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,576
No survivors.

485
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:03,537
And the man in charge?

486
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:06,917
Herzog.

487
00:48:08,376 --> 00:48:11,076
Those bodies are still buried there.

488
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,752
Buried in the frozen soil.

489
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:16,996
Preserved. Waiting.

490
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:21,082
Waiting for what?

491
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:23,877
For the same thing that drives Herzog.

492
00:48:23,886 --> 00:48:25,126
Revenge!

493
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:28,416
And guess who's gonna give it to them?

494
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:32,577
The man who can raise the dead?

495
00:48:33,126 --> 00:48:34,826
Kafucking...

496
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:37,206
You guys go after Herzog,
try and slow him down.

497
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,289
Give us as much time as possible, okay?

498
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,924
What if this doesn't work?

499
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:44,037
It has to. All we have
to do is get to Kven mountain,

500
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:46,882
find Stavarin, wake him back from the dead,
then bring him back to Talvik

501
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,576
so he can help us fight Herzog and his men.

502
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:50,582
Easy.

503
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:52,132
Besides...

504
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:55,379
We got help.

505
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:02,709
Here we go.

506
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:15,134
He is our last hope.

507
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:31,999
Look! A tank!

508
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:53,579
Visitors, now?

509
00:49:54,084 --> 00:49:55,254
That's early.

510
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:12,461
Hello?

511
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:23,634
Look. His army is growing bigger.

512
00:51:25,626 --> 00:51:29,791
Glenn, are there any more towns or
villages before he reaches Talvik?

514
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:31,674
Maybe a few houses, but that's it.

515
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,827
Good. So what he has now
he'll use for his attack.

516
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:36,924
Yeah, pretty much, that is, until he starts

517
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,537
killing the people of Talvik,
making them join him as well.

518
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:41,172
How many people live in Talvik?

519
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:44,126
- About 3,000.
- What? Holy shit!

521
00:51:44,126 --> 00:51:47,042
All the more reason for us to
slow him down as much as we can.

523
00:51:47,876 --> 00:51:50,706
Look. Do you know how to use
one of those things?

524
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:53,131
Of course. I'm from
Northern Norway, aren't I?

525
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:57,376
I don't know what that means.
Okay, guys, pack light.

526
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:00,166
We're moving out. Now!

527
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:08,786
What in the name of God
has happened here?

528
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:12,957
What does the forensic team say?

529
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:16,884
That's not the forensic team.
That's just Tom and Ole.

530
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,456
They put on white suits today.

531
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:20,251
They thought it looked more professional.

532
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:22,042
Nice.

533
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:24,957
The real forensic team
is gonna be here this evening.

534
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:27,749
Do we have any witnesses?

535
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:31,382
Not unless you can get the seagulls
to talk. Doesn't look good.

536
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:35,326
Seagulls, yeah, well.
That's an amazing invention, isn't it?

537
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:38,674
You know, the guy, the person who
can come up with a thingy

538
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,747
that could translate seagull
language into human language.

539
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:45,537
The guy who come up with that thing,
he would make a fortune, you know.

541
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:49,921
Okay, let's get these bodies up to Talvik,

542
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:53,377
before the Seagulls eat them,
and let us take lots of photos,

543
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:55,076
or else the creepers will have my balls.

544
00:52:55,459 --> 00:52:59,579
Hey, boss, here's a picture
from the surveillance camera.

545
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:05,167
Isn't that...?

546
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:12,627
Would you eat my little man-pussy?

547
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:15,997
Okay!

548
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:19,424
All right, all right, all right. Let's move.

549
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,037
Let's move! Come on, hurry up.

550
00:53:22,126 --> 00:53:25,286
Listen up, we gotta hurry. Move out!

551
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,377
- There they are.
- And they have a tank, I see.

552
00:53:30,386 --> 00:53:32,496
Yeah, they stole it from the museum.

553
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,632
Ah, fuck!

554
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:37,957
What is that?

555
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:41,706
A large-ass tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

556
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:42,829
No, no, no, no.

557
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,964
- That. What is that?
- Oh.

558
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,249
These are replicas of the binoculars

559
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:49,331
that Han and Chewie used
on the planet Hoth.

560
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:51,044
Did you guys know... Fun fact...

561
00:53:51,048 --> 00:53:52,792
- All of the Hoth scenes were...
- Shh!

562
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:56,921
...filmed here in Norway.
This place called Finse.

564
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,497
Girls, can we please maybe focus on,

565
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:01,921
you know, the Nazi zombies instead?

566
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,287
What do we do?

567
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:07,747
Well, Daniel told us to slow them down,
so that's what we're gonna do.

569
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:08,999
Look.

570
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,877
We need to get out there,
get their attention

571
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:14,626
and lure them into the swamps, right?

572
00:54:15,042 --> 00:54:16,832
And then, when they get stuck,

573
00:54:16,834 --> 00:54:20,544
we can use the fertilizer bombs we made
and blow them into bits and pieces.

575
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,332
That sounds basically impossible.

576
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:24,497
And how are you planning on
luring them out there?

577
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:26,401
We need... we need bait. Live bait.

578
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:30,379
Yes, we need someone
to attract their attention.

579
00:54:30,386 --> 00:54:33,956
Someone who is light on their feet,

580
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:37,999
who knows these swamps, and can move
through them without getting stuck.

582
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:45,131
What?

583
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:46,826
No.

584
00:54:47,959 --> 00:54:51,169
No. That's a swamp.
I'm not getting out there!

585
00:54:51,177 --> 00:54:53,377
Who says I won't get stuck?
And one more thing,

586
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:56,576
Those things are fucking zombies

587
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,576
who want to rip my face off!

588
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:01,497
Hey, Talvik is your hometown, am I right?

589
00:55:01,751 --> 00:55:02,331
Yeah.

590
00:55:02,584 --> 00:55:04,634
You must have people you love there.

591
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:07,211
Yeah. Especially one ma...

592
00:55:07,626 --> 00:55:10,536
...woman that I love.

593
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:12,502
With long hair and big breasts.

594
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,626
Do it for...

595
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:15,792
"her".

596
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:19,709
You just bring them here,
and we'll do the rest.

597
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:20,786
Capisce?

598
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:30,497
Hey, man.

599
00:55:31,334 --> 00:55:32,004
Martin?

600
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:33,667
Yeah?

601
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:35,712
Are you okay?

602
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:37,536
Yeah.

603
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:43,252
First we wake up
a battalion of Nazi zombies,

604
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:44,631
And now I'm supposed to...

605
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,417
wake up a bunch of dead Russian guys.

606
00:55:47,417 --> 00:55:49,877
Martin, look, your arm, your power,

607
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:52,997
is the only thing that can
take down Herzog at this point.

608
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:56,134
Remember that. If we don't succeed,

609
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:01,287
his power will keep growing
until he's unstoppable.

610
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:07,541
That, my friend, is a big bowl of shit

611
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:09,712
that we don't want to live in.

612
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:17,964
Oh!

613
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,377
Oh, my God. That's... That's...

614
00:56:21,459 --> 00:56:23,329
That is vile-smelling.

615
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:26,667
How did it fill up the car
so fast? That smell...

616
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:28,957
No, it's all right.
He's just carsick, or something.

617
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:30,829
That smells foul!

618
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:32,881
No, no, no, no!

619
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:35,294
Fuck! That's disgusting!

620
00:56:39,501 --> 00:56:40,751
That smells!

621
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:29,287
I didn't know there was supposed to be
an "ugly face" convention in town.

623
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:36,421
Well, come get me, then.

624
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:38,631
Come get me.

625
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:43,376
Come get me, if you dare!

626
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:02,172
Go!

627
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:08,001
Halt!

628
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:14,834
- It's working. They're following him!
- But not Herzog, and most of his men. Shit.

630
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:16,964
No, no, no. It's okay.
We've got their attention.

631
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:19,542
If we take these guys out,
he'll come for us himself.

632
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,327
Come on, Glenn!

633
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:31,381
- Run faster!
- Faster!

634
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,211
Yes!

635
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,172
- Come on, Glenn!
- Go, go, go, go!

636
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,079
- Yes. yes!
- Yes.

637
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:16,831
- Run, Glenn!
- Faster!

638
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:19,132
Run, run!

639
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:27,827
Please, God...

640
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,542
- Yes!
- Yes!

641
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,632
Oh, my God, Blake!

642
00:59:40,501 --> 00:59:43,881
- USA! USA!
- USA! USA!

643
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:46,289
- USA!
- Yeah!

644
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:49,712
Shot!

645
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:01,749
- Hey.
- Hey!

646
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:03,424
That tank is moving.

647
01:00:06,126 --> 01:00:07,246
That can't be good.

648
01:00:22,209 --> 01:00:23,669
- Run!
- Run!

649
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:07,382
Talvik. Now.

650
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:01,381
Hey.

651
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:07,206
- Where are we?
- We're getting close.

653
01:02:08,209 --> 01:02:09,539
But we're also stuck.

654
01:02:14,376 --> 01:02:15,286
Can I push it?

655
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:17,749
I don't think that would help.

656
01:02:18,626 --> 01:02:21,286
Is it far? We could walk.

657
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:22,882
We don't have that kind of time.

658
01:02:25,751 --> 01:02:29,381
If only we could find something
to put under the car.

659
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:31,626
You know, something that
would give us traction.

660
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:34,457
Then I could get us out of here.

661
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:25,832
Oh, there she is.

662
01:03:26,626 --> 01:03:28,996
It was a bloody nightmare trying to
find space for all the bodies.

663
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:31,041
I mean, the fridge is completely full,

664
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:33,672
so we just had to put all the rest
of them on the garage floor

665
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:35,707
and throw a shitload of ice cubes on top.

666
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:38,131
That sounds like a perfect solution.

667
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:38,826
Thanks.

668
01:03:39,459 --> 01:03:43,459
Ah, you know,
mostly Germans, French people.

669
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:46,464
Don't think they pictured this
when they ordered a trip to Norway.

670
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:49,707
No, getting their heads and arms hacked off
and their intestines ripped out?

672
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:53,789
- Doubt it.
- Well, unless they're into that kinky shit.

673
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:00,037
Should you be doing that?

674
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:03,132
Where's the, you know...
the special force?

675
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,962
It was really windy down in Alta,
so the plane couldn't land,

677
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,379
but they should be here tomorrow afternoon.

678
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:11,132
That's perfect.

679
01:04:12,459 --> 01:04:13,169
What?

680
01:04:14,042 --> 01:04:16,832
Yeah. This is our chance.

681
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:20,499
We're gonna show people
what we're really made of, here.

682
01:04:20,876 --> 01:04:21,706
What are you talking about?

683
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:26,834
We are gonna find
Martin Hykkerud ourselves.

684
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:30,084
We're gonna bring him in.
We're gonna be heroes,

685
01:04:30,084 --> 01:04:33,924
not those fancy, dressed-up,
stuck-up, sushi-eating

686
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:35,457
dickweeds from the south.

687
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,629
Beef the boys...

688
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:40,249
Brief the boys.

689
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:43,461
Send a picture out to every cop
and citizen in Talvik.

690
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:46,579
If he so much as stops to make a piss,

691
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:49,464
I want to know both color
and scent of that urine.

692
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:50,379
Color and scent.

693
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:52,291
Get the shotguns ready.

694
01:04:54,376 --> 01:04:56,996
We're gonna shoot something else
than seagulls for a change.

695
01:05:02,626 --> 01:05:04,246
Do you really think this is going to work?

696
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:07,751
I mean, say we actually manage to wake

697
01:05:07,751 --> 01:05:09,251
these Russians back to life...

698
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:11,956
What's stopping them from killing us?

699
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:15,752
I don't know what's gonna happen.

700
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:17,786
But judging based on him...

701
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:22,672
He treats you like you're his master.
So, hopefully they do the same.

703
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:24,582
Hopefully.

704
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:26,424
Hope... Look, what...
I don't know, man.

705
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:29,131
This is some unprecedented, unheard of,

706
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:32,076
mysterious, voodoo-zombie shit, man.

707
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:34,711
I've never seen this before.

708
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,002
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not in any of them.

710
01:05:40,334 --> 01:05:42,464
You've created a whole
new genre here, man.

711
01:05:44,376 --> 01:05:48,666
Look, I mean, if we're gonna go up against
a battalion of Nazi zombies,

712
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:50,997
we could do a whole lot worse
than teaming up

713
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:53,001
with a battalion of Russian zombies.

714
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:56,961
He has to die, you know.

715
01:05:57,334 --> 01:05:58,464
Herzog.

716
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:00,577
For what he did.

717
01:06:01,126 --> 01:06:02,496
We have to kill him.

718
01:06:04,584 --> 01:06:06,044
I have to kill him.

719
01:06:07,376 --> 01:06:08,496
For Hanna.

720
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:13,292
This is it.

721
01:06:14,251 --> 01:06:14,961
Yeah.

722
01:06:16,709 --> 01:06:17,879
This is definitely it.

723
01:06:20,584 --> 01:06:25,294
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

724
01:06:25,298 --> 01:06:26,962
So they've gotta be buried...

725
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:29,002
in this frozen ground.

726
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:33,212
How do we do this?

727
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:38,134
You do it just like you did with him.

728
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:40,884
I put my hand on his head.

729
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:44,922
Okay. Right?

730
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:45,787
Yeah?

731
01:06:47,626 --> 01:06:50,496
We can't dig up everyone.
It'll take weeks.

732
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:52,831
You have to wake them up
one way or another.

733
01:09:17,626 --> 01:09:21,786
Master...

734
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,042
Fuck yeah!

735
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:05,584
First, he was seen here.

736
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:08,791
In Oxfjord.

737
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:13,212
Next, here. By the museum at Ice Bay.

739
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:16,037
Then it looks like he's turning south.

740
01:10:20,626 --> 01:10:22,166
Gunga, we have a situation.

741
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:25,077
So what they said on the phone
there was a bunch of guys

743
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:27,584
dressed up as German soldiers going crazy?

744
01:10:27,584 --> 01:10:30,214
If by crazy, he means slaughtering
a bunch of people, then, yeah.

745
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:34,037
What the hell is going on? We haven't had,
a decent murder here since 1974.

747
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:35,252
And now this?

748
01:10:35,792 --> 01:10:37,712
Okay, guys, listen up!

749
01:10:38,459 --> 01:10:41,209
Shoot first, ask questions later!

750
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:24,669
Hey!

751
01:11:26,626 --> 01:11:27,786
You're too late.

752
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:29,877
There's nobody here.

753
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:32,081
We sent them away.

754
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:34,169
Since there's nobody here,

755
01:11:34,177 --> 01:11:37,667
maybe you should forget
about your assignment and

756
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:41,171
return to your little snow cave.

757
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:14,499
Somebody's grown. Gotten bigger!

758
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:21,754
I hope you don't mind but I,
invited some friends to tag along.

759
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:05,502
Don't you just hate it

760
01:13:06,084 --> 01:13:10,332
when somebody that was supposed
to be dead comes back to kill you?

762
01:13:38,459 --> 01:13:39,709
Let's kill 'em.

763
01:13:40,626 --> 01:13:41,786
Troops!

764
01:13:45,084 --> 01:13:46,794
Attack!

765
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,787
Let's kill 'em all!

766
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,214
What the hell is going on?

767
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:08,792
Is there a carnival in town?

768
01:16:02,126 --> 01:16:03,456
Is that a tank?

769
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:20,212
Get out of the car!

770
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,999
Ah! Get out!

771
01:16:45,042 --> 01:16:46,002
Daniel!

772
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:47,709
The tank.

773
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,172
- Shouldn't we help them?
- Help who?

774
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,747
The guys with rotten skin
in Russian uniforms?

775
01:18:04,751 --> 01:18:07,671
Or the guys with rotten skin
in German uniforms?

776
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:39,577
Okay.

777
01:18:53,126 --> 01:18:54,126
Good boy.

778
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:14,327
- What the fuck is going on?
- It looks like a computer game.

779
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:16,174
Gunga, look! Look, it's him!

780
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:17,537
It's Martin Hykkerud!

781
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:21,917
- Should we go get him?
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

782
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:24,957
This is technical police work.

783
01:19:51,001 --> 01:19:53,421
Zombie Squad. It's about time!

784
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,247
- It's a long story.
- There was a tank.

785
01:19:55,626 --> 01:19:57,126
A guy took my jacket.

786
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:00,457
Looks like you found
Stavarin and his men, I see.

787
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:02,792
Yeah, but there's still more than us.

788
01:20:03,376 --> 01:20:06,076
I guess it's time we even out
the odds a bit, huh?

789
01:20:50,959 --> 01:20:52,249
- Guys!
- What?

790
01:20:52,251 --> 01:20:53,461
We're losing!

791
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:54,962
Look!

792
01:20:57,709 --> 01:20:58,669
Shit!

793
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:10,751
No, no, no...

794
01:21:12,209 --> 01:21:13,499
No!

795
01:21:22,626 --> 01:21:23,706
Wait!

796
01:21:25,209 --> 01:21:26,289
We have to kill him!

797
01:21:27,584 --> 01:21:30,214
They're all bound to him
like the Russians are to you.

798
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,379
If he dies, the others will too.

799
01:21:35,792 --> 01:21:37,082
Let's finish this.

800
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:43,457
Sub-human.

801
01:22:59,376 --> 01:23:01,456
Guys, come on. No seat belts?

802
01:23:02,876 --> 01:23:04,206
You're just askin' for it.

803
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:37,251
Fucking hell, how many more
of these are there?

804
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:44,172
Is this it?

805
01:23:47,834 --> 01:23:51,499
- Monica, is this how it's gonna end?
- No. No.

807
01:23:53,126 --> 01:23:55,424
- Are we gonna die now?
- No.

809
01:23:58,084 --> 01:23:58,924
Fuck it.

810
01:24:01,209 --> 01:24:03,379
Fuck it, I'm just...
just gonna say it.

811
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:04,786
What?

812
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:06,381
I...

813
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,131
Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, am...

814
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,042
No!

815
01:24:14,167 --> 01:24:16,207
Blake! Glenn?

816
01:24:17,084 --> 01:24:18,294
Monica?

817
01:27:26,126 --> 01:27:28,626
Why didn't you just stay on the mountain?

818
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:36,232
You got what you wanted.
You got your gold...

819
01:27:37,584 --> 01:27:39,134
your treasure.

820
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:45,221
But it wasn't enough, was it?

821
01:27:47,959 --> 01:27:49,289
You got greedy.

822
01:27:51,084 --> 01:27:52,424
You wanted more.

823
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,172
Monica. Watch out!

824
01:28:04,292 --> 01:28:06,042
- Monica!
- Blake!

825
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:12,384
Blake! No!

826
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:25,787
That's why you lost the war.

827
01:28:31,792 --> 01:28:33,132
Did you know?

828
01:28:35,667 --> 01:28:37,377
You lost the war.

829
01:28:40,126 --> 01:28:41,576
You got greedy.

830
01:28:45,459 --> 01:28:46,879
Guess what?

831
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:50,917
You lose again.

832
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:00,964
No!

833
01:29:15,209 --> 01:29:15,999
My God!

834
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:20,291
He did it!

835
01:29:21,626 --> 01:29:23,826
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked!

836
01:29:25,584 --> 01:29:26,674
I knew it!

837
01:29:28,376 --> 01:29:29,666
Herzog is dead.

838
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:31,962
He's dead!

839
01:29:32,251 --> 01:29:33,381
Yes!

840
01:29:48,584 --> 01:29:50,084
Holy cow, that was close.

841
01:30:03,209 --> 01:30:05,749
You did it! You killed Herzog!

842
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:07,332
Uh-huh.

843
01:30:07,876 --> 01:30:10,876
I can't believe that that actually worked.

844
01:30:11,876 --> 01:30:13,166
Of course it did.

845
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:15,792
You doubted the Zombie Squad?

846
01:30:18,251 --> 01:30:20,381
Glenn Kenneth, is he...?

847
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:24,584
He didn't make it.

848
01:30:36,667 --> 01:30:39,497
It's been a true honor
killing zombies with you guys.

849
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:42,502
You too, Martin.

850
01:30:48,501 --> 01:30:49,881
What is it?

851
01:30:51,209 --> 01:30:52,289
Okay.

852
01:30:53,376 --> 01:30:55,456
- You can say it.
- Go for it.

853
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:01,289
May the force be with you.

854
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:09,381
Really? That one? Of all.
You chose that one?

855
01:31:09,584 --> 01:31:11,424
There's like a million to choose from.

856
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:13,127
Why would you choose that one?

857
01:31:37,126 --> 01:31:38,126
Where are they?

858
01:31:38,959 --> 01:31:40,169
They were just here.

859
01:31:40,501 --> 01:31:41,711
I don't know.

860
01:31:44,084 --> 01:31:45,134
Bjarne!

861
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:47,246
Are you in a coma?

862
01:31:48,084 --> 01:31:49,464
Go and find them!

863
01:31:53,459 --> 01:31:55,999
I was supposed to solve this murder case,

864
01:31:56,751 --> 01:31:59,131
not end up with a hundred new bodies.

865
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:01,461
Yeah, I don't know where
we're gonna put them all.

866
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:04,079
Both the garage and the freezer
are completely packed.

867
01:32:04,584 --> 01:32:07,474
I don't know. I do...
I dont... I don't know!

868
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:13,377
The seagulls again.

869
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:16,167
They haven't eaten
this well since the war.

870
01:32:16,626 --> 01:32:19,076
You know. We should've had
that machine, you know.

871
01:32:19,084 --> 01:32:21,464
That seagull translator machine.

872
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:23,289
We could've cracked this case like an egg.

873
01:32:24,626 --> 01:32:25,786
Like an egg.

874
01:32:33,126 --> 01:32:34,956
"Turn around"

875
01:32:34,959 --> 01:32:38,329
"Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely"

876
01:32:38,334 --> 01:32:40,584
"And you're never coming round"

877
01:32:40,584 --> 01:32:42,464
"Turn around"

878
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:45,749
"Every now and then
I get a little bit tired"

879
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:48,211
"Of listening to the sound of my tears"

880
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,829
"Turn around"

881
01:32:49,834 --> 01:32:53,294
"Every now and then
I get a little bit nervous"

882
01:32:53,298 --> 01:32:55,462
"That the best of all the years have gone by"

883
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:57,459
"Turn around"

884
01:32:57,459 --> 01:33:00,629
"Every now and then I get
a little bit terrified"

885
01:33:00,636 --> 01:33:03,036
"And then I see
the look in your eyes"

886
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:06,712
"Turn around, bright eyes"

887
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,879
"Every now and then I fall apart"

888
01:33:08,886 --> 01:33:12,246
"Turn around, bright eyes"

889
01:33:12,251 --> 01:33:15,381
"Every now and then I fall apart"

890
01:33:15,501 --> 01:33:22,541
"And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever"

891
01:33:22,709 --> 01:33:29,789
"And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever"

892
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:33,577
"And we'll only be making it right"

893
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,827
"'Cause we'll never be wrong"

894
01:33:35,834 --> 01:33:39,544
"Together we can take it
to the end of the line"

895
01:33:39,548 --> 01:33:43,042
"Your love is like a shadow
on me all of the time"

896
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:44,922
"All of the time"

897
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:48,497
"I don't know what to do
and I'm always in the dark"

898
01:33:48,501 --> 01:33:52,131
"We're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks"

899
01:33:52,417 --> 01:33:55,167
"I really need you tonight"

900
01:33:55,167 --> 01:34:01,287
"Forever's gonna start tonight"

901
01:34:01,376 --> 01:34:04,746
"Once upon a time I was falling in love"

902
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:07,631
"But now I'm only falling apart"

903
01:34:10,209 --> 01:34:14,879
"There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart"

904
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:50,171
"Turn around, bright eyes"

905
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,957
"Every now and then I fall apart"

906
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:55,539
"Turn around, bright eyes"

907
01:34:55,542 --> 01:34:58,542
"Every now and then I fall apart"

908
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:02,252
"And I need you now tonight"

909
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:05,582
"And I need you more than ever"

910
01:35:05,584 --> 01:35:09,294
"And if you only hold me tight"

911
01:35:09,298 --> 01:35:12,752
"We'll be holding on forever"

912
01:35:12,758 --> 01:35:16,421
"And we'll only be making it right"

913
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:18,577
"'Cause we'll never be wrong"

914
01:35:18,584 --> 01:35:22,134
"Together we can take it
to the end of the line"

915
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:25,626
"Your love is like a shadow
on me all of the time"

916
01:35:25,626 --> 01:35:27,326
"All of the time"

917
01:35:27,334 --> 01:35:28,714
"I don't know what to do"

918
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,709
"I'm always in the dark"

919
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:34,539
"Living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks"

920
01:35:36,376 --> 01:35:39,126
"I really need you tonight"

921
01:35:39,126 --> 01:35:44,956
"Forever's gonna start tonight"

922
01:35:44,959 --> 01:35:48,629
"Once upon a time I was falling in love"

923
01:35:48,636 --> 01:35:51,456
"But now I'm only falling apart"

924
01:35:54,126 --> 01:35:56,076
"Nothing I can say"

925
01:35:56,084 --> 01:36:00,754
"A total eclipse of the heart"

926
01:36:03,501 --> 01:36:08,251
"A total eclipse of the heart"
