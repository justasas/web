1
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:31,111
I feel as if I should be angry
with that child, that ...

2
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:35,711
naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her ...

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,911
for not recognising the
nature of that monster.

4
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,911
For not being aware of what
she was getting into.

5
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,011
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

6
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:54,611
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said, in Berlin:

7
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:59,511
'No, I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Führer's headquarters.'

8
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:03,711
But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.

9
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:07,311
I also didn't realise ...

10
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:13,511
that destiny would take me 
somewhere I didn't want to be.

11
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:20,311
But, nevertheless, I find 
it hard to forgive myself.

12
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,611
The ladies are here.

13
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:33,211
It's confirmed.
- They can pass.

14
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:05,411
'Wolfsschanze'
headquarters of the Führer

15
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,111
November 1942
Rastenburg, East-Prussia

16
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:13,811
Sit down, ladies.

17
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:20,511
One moment. The Führer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

18
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:27,311
Can you tell us ... How are we 
supposed to address the Führer?

19
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:32,511
The Führer first speaks to you and 
then you reply: Heil, mein Führer.

20
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:34,611
And the Nazi salute?

21
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:37,111
That won't be necessary ...

22
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:42,411
since the Führer isn't looking for
a soldier, but for a secretary.

23
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,611
Act as normal and calm
as you can.

24
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,711
I'll see if
he has time for you.

25
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,011
Mein Führer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

26
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:20,411
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

27
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:25,611
Sometimes, during a war,
one is not in control of time.

28
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:31,311
Can I ask your name?
- Margarethe Lorenz.

29
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,511
Where are you from?
- From Fulda.

30
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:38,611
And what is your name?
- Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Führer.

31
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:42,311
No need for that.
Where are you from?

32
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,911
Frankfurt am Main, mein Füh ...

33
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,111
Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

34
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:52,211
In Pankow, to be precise.

35
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:55,911
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Schwaben.

36
00:03:57,511 --> 00:04:01,011
And you are?
- Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

37
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,811
A lady from Munich.

38
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,711
Shall we start then,
Fräulein Humps?

39
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:31,311
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

40
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:35,511
She's much smarter
than most people.

41
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:43,311
First, sit down, please.

42
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:47,911
Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.

43
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:51,611
You won't make nearly as many.

44
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:02,611
You're very young.

45
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,711
How old are you?
- 22, mein Führer.

46
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:16,611
My German fellow-countrymen
and women ...

47
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:18,811
fellow party members.

48
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:23,411
It is, I think, rather special ...

49
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:30,111
that, after 20 years of service, a man 
still stands in front of his supporters ...

50
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:40,011
and that in all those 20 years, his
program never needed to be modified.

51
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:58,911
I suggest we try it again.

52
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,311
I did it.
He hired me.

53
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:32,611
Berlin - 20 April 1945
Hitler's 56th birthday ...

54
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:34,711
two and a half years later.

55
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,311
Take cover.

56
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:44,411
Hurry. Continue.
Get that off the street.

57
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:48,011
Take cover.

58
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:02,211
That's artillery fire.

59
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:06,711
Don't be silly.
Where would it be coming from?

60
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:09,911
You're right. These are no planes,
this is artillery.

61
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:15,611
It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.

62
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,911
Where is that cannon 
fire coming from?

63
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:25,011
Happy Birthday,
mein Führer.

64
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,711
The city centre of Berlin
is under fire.

65
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:32,511
Grenades have hit near the 
Brandenburger Tor and the Reichstag.

66
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:35,511
Where did they come from?
- We don't know yet.

67
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:39,111
I have Koller on the line.
- Give me Koller.

68
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:43,711
Koller, do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?

69
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,511
No.
- Can't you hear the shooting?

70
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:51,111
No, I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
- Berlin is chaotic.

71
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,211
Apparently, the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

72
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,411
The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.

73
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,011
It's not long-range artillery.

74
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:06,111
The anti-aircraft defence near the
Zoo-Bunker reports they're 10 to 12 ...

75
00:08:06,311 --> 00:08:10,711
cm calibres. The Russians have
positions near Marzahn.

76
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:15,511
That's only 12 kilometres from the 
centre. Are the Russians that close?

77
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:19,711
They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.

78
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:24,011
This is unheard-of.

79
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:27,111
The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.

80
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,711
Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.

81
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,411
Maybe it's long-range artillery,
after all.

82
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:38,011
That railway bridge over the Oder ...
- Nonsense.

83
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,911
That Himmler,
such a pompous buffoon.

84
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:53,011
Party bosses, everywhere.
They make me so sick.

85
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,911
The Führer starts
'Clausewitz' today.

86
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:02,511
Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.

87
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,211
If the Führer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.

88
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:10,311
We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.

89
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:14,011
He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.

90
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:17,611
Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.

91
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,811
Talk to your sister-in-law, then.

92
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:26,411
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

93
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:30,611
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

94
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,811
You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.

95
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,911
Do you want to die here?
- Absolutely not.

96
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:44,311
Gentlemen, the Führer.

97
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:58,711
Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

98
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:10,111
What's going on?
- We're leaving.

99
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,811
'Clausewitz' has started.

100
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:17,811
All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.

101
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:21,611
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

102
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,211
Don't ask me, professor.
- This is insane.

103
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,111
Professor.

104
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,211
I won't allow the
evacuation of my office.

105
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:53,811
Is that so?
- Food supply would collapse.

106
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:57,011
A good soldier can
always find food.

107
00:10:57,711 --> 00:11:02,211
And when there's fighting all over the city,
where does he get it? The population.

108
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:06,211
It's irresponsible.
- It's an order from the Führer.

109
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:11,011
As department head, I
report to the SS and to Himmler.

110
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:15,511
But as a doctor, I'm part of the 
Wehrmacht and they're not leaving yet.

111
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:18,711
Keep that in mind.

112
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:27,011
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

113
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:32,311
We're leaving.

114
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:48,411
Everything for Germany.
Heil, mein Führer.

115
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:52,611
Führer, I ...
Heil, mein Führer.

116
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,711
They're in such a hurry
to get away from here.

117
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,311
The brown nosing is the worst.

118
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:03,411
They say 'Sieg Heil'. but they 
think 'Lick my ... you know what.'

119
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:12,111
Mein Führer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.

120
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:14,911
Too late?

121
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,511
Hewel, come here for a moment.

122
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:23,711
I'm sure you agree we should 
contact the Allies ...

123
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:29,411
and start conducting politics.
- Certainly. We need politics.

124
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:33,611
Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.

125
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,311
I'm fed up with it.

126
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:42,511
When I'm dead, you'll have 
plenty of time for politics.

127
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:48,911
It's good, dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.

128
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:53,811
It's good.
Just go.

129
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:16,011
He has no strength left.

130
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:20,511
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?

131
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:24,611
Seriously, though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

132
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,811
Berlin will fall 
in a couple of days.

133
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:32,911
When the Führer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?

134
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:36,111
Why do you think they'll
negotiate with you?

135
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:39,911
The Nazi state and my SS 
are needed to maintain order.

136
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,111
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

137
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:48,211
The first contact has been made.
- Careful, that's high treason.

138
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:51,311
Fegelein, I have other concerns.

139
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:56,511
Should I give Eisenhower the 
Nazi salute or shake his hand?

140
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:04,811
Look at that.

141
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:09,511
The best guests
always arrive late.

142
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:15,011
Leaving already, gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

143
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:20,311
The scorched-earth order ...
- I really have to go now.

144
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:23,511
Come and see me one day
in Hohenlychen.

145
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:31,211
I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.

146
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:45,811
You know, Speer ... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

147
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:51,511
It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.

148
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:56,811
When the war will be over,
reconstruction will be quick.

149
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:04,011
We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.

150
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:08,811
You're a true genius, Speer.

151
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:16,011
Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know that
the Third Reich would be inconceivable ...

152
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:21,311
with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

153
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:26,511
This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture ...

154
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:30,211
that will survive 
thousands of years.

155
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:34,611
We see, before us, the ancient 
cities, the Acropolis ...

156
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:37,811
We see the medieval cities ...
the cathedrals ...

157
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:42,411
and we know that the people
need that.

158
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,311
Indeed, Speer.

159
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:53,011
That was my vision ...

160
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:57,111
and it still is.

161
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:04,811
Mein Führer, if you want to realize
these plans, you must leave Berlin.

162
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:13,311
Eva, you say something.

163
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:16,911
He's the Führer.
He knows what's best.

164
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:22,111
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

165
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:24,811
I can't do that, my child.

166
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:30,811
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

167
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:36,411
I have to solve the problem,
here in Berlin, or perish.

168
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,211
Speer ...

169
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:43,411
what do you think?

170
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:48,011
You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.

171
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:07,511
Reload.

172
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:20,011
Go away. Leave me alone.

173
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:24,211
How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?

174
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,811
Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.

175
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:32,011
Who are you? What do you want?
I want my son. Alive.

176
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:35,611
You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.

177
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:39,311
The Führer will decorate him
for it, today.

178
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:42,911
You're still young.
At which front did you fight?

179
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:45,611
I haven't had
the honour yet.

180
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:50,711
Count yourself lucky.
Send the children home.

181
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:53,911
We'll defend this position
to the last man.

182
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:57,511
Which position?
This is not a position, it's a trap.

183
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,711
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

184
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,411
We'll shoot back.
- What with?

185
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:07,011
With the anti-aircraft guns.

186
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:11,111
The Russians will arrive with several
armies, tanks and heavy artillery.

187
00:18:11,711 --> 00:18:15,711
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

188
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,911
We promised the Führer.

189
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:22,611
Don't you understand?
The war is lost.

190
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:24,211
Coward.

191
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:30,911
Go away. Right now.

192
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,611
If you're still here when the Russians
arrive, you'll all be dead.

193
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:45,911
The 9th army had to retreat
or they would have been decimated ...

194
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:51,711
We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.

195
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:54,911
Führer, then the 9th army is lost.

196
00:18:55,511 --> 00:19:00,511
We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east ...

197
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:05,311
with a ruthless, mighty attack.

198
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,511
Using which units?

199
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:13,111
Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th army.

200
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:17,911
The 9th army is unable to move.

201
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,511
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

202
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:24,111
Wenck's 12th army must
support them.

203
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:29,711
The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
- Then it must turn around.

204
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:34,511
Then the western front would be open.
- Do you doubt my orders?

205
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:38,711
I think I've been
clear enough.

206
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:47,411
The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.

207
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:52,711
We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.

208
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,211
Mohnke, you're here.
- Mein Führer.

209
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:21,411
Today, 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.

210
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:26,611
You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.

211
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:31,311
We'll fight 
until the last man, in Berlin.

212
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:36,011
There are still three million civilians
here. They have to be evacuated.

213
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:43,711
I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.

214
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:48,011
We can't spend any energy
on so-called civilians.

215
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:53,711
With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children ...

216
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:56,911
and the thousands of wounded
and elderly?

217
00:20:57,511 --> 00:21:01,011
In a war such as this one,
there are no civilians.

218
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:04,211
The Führer has lost all
sense of reality.

219
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:07,811
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

220
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:13,511
Gruppe Steiner has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

221
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:17,711
But why don't you tell him that?
- He doesn't listen to reason.

222
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:22,411
Something has to happen.
- Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

223
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:28,711
We're soldiers.
We took an oath.

224
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,311
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

225
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:34,911
And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?

226
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:37,111
I beg your pardon?

227
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:04,411
Where were you?
- None of your business.

228
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:17,411
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.

229
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:27,911
I'm proud of you.

230
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:35,611
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

231
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:40,811
His name is Peter Kranz.
- So you're Peter.

232
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,611
I wish my generals were
as brave as you.

233
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:57,611
Very good.

234
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:06,211
You've made history.

235
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:11,311
And when Germania will rise
from these ruins ...

236
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:14,011
you will be the heroes.

237
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:17,711
Heil, to you.

238
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:51,511
I don't know about you,
but I prefer air raids.

239
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:57,211
What will happen to us?
- I could go if I wanted to.

240
00:23:57,911 --> 00:24:02,411
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go, can we?

241
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:04,611
I can't go either.

242
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:12,911
I wouldn't know
where to go.

243
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:18,111
My parents and all
my friends warned me.

244
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:21,311
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

245
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:24,611
What should I say:
'Hello, I made a mistake'?

246
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:27,511
'When things went wrong,
I admitted my mistake.'

247
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:32,211
Life will go on.

248
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:43,811
What do you think, Herr Oberst?
- We have to go.

249
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:50,011
Go where?
- I don't know.

250
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:52,711
Wherever they need us.

251
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,211
Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.

252
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:08,911
Come on.

253
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,611
Come, children.

254
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:23,411
We should have fun today.

255
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:34,411
Wherever the enemy goes,
all they find is destruction.

256
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:38,111
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

257
00:25:39,811 --> 00:25:43,311
No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no traffic.

258
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:51,011
If you destroy everything, our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.

259
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:54,811
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

260
00:25:56,011 --> 00:26:00,011
If the war is lost, what does it 
matter that the people are lost too?

261
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:06,211
The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant, right now.

262
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,911
On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.

263
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,111
Our people turned out weak ...

264
00:26:13,711 --> 00:26:17,211
and according to the laws of nature,
they should die out.

265
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,911
They're your people.
You're their Führer.

266
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:24,011
What remains after this battle ...

267
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:29,111
is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

268
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:39,911
Come along. You have to dance.

269
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:43,611
Care to dance, Fräulein Braun?
- I'd love to.

270
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:11,411
May I?
- Go ahead.

271
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:13,511
What's wrong?

272
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,811
We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.

273
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:27,611
Or else, come with me.

274
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:38,111
You'll die.

275
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,411
Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.

276
00:28:03,111 --> 00:28:04,111
Dance.

277
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,311
Do you have a request?
- As long as it swings.

278
00:28:38,811 --> 00:28:40,311
Traudl.

279
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:48,711
It's all so unreal.

280
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:54,911
It's like a dream you
can't get out of.

281
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:57,111
It keeps on going.

282
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:04,011
Gerda, I don't feel well.

283
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:42,011
Traudl, come.

284
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:03,711
I did not move ...

285
00:30:05,811 --> 00:30:08,311
I did not move
my command post.

286
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:11,811
To the west? How so?

287
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,511
I'm at 1,000 meters from the enemy.
- General.

288
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:38,011
And, general?

289
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,211
I'll be executed.
- What? Why?

290
00:30:42,411 --> 00:30:46,411
They think I moved my
command post to the west.

291
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:50,111
Be sensible, general.
- Come along.

292
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:09,311
Schenck.
- Mohnke.

293
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:14,411
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.

294
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:19,111
I need help.
- That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

295
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,811
My assistant and I are
the only ones here.

296
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:24,911
You're a doctor, aren't you?
- Yes, an internist.

297
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:29,511
Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication ...

298
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:32,711
you can find, to me.

299
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:36,311
I'll do my best.
- Thanks. Hurry.

300
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,611
I need to talk to the Führer.

301
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:33,311
What about?
- I'm going to be executed.

302
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:38,011
Wait here.

303
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,711
Your weapon, please.

304
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:49,011
Not here.

305
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:56,111
Guard post 2.
Understood.

306
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,911
General ...

307
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,011
Not you.

308
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:30,111
What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?

309
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:34,711
You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.

310
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:39,911
Officers who don't obey,
must be executed.

311
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:43,611
What do you mean? My troops 
have been fighting for days.

312
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:48,811
My command post is a kilometre 
away from the front line.

313
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:51,011
Continue.

314
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:55,511
Do you see this? I don't want you
to use that tone with me.

315
00:33:57,311 --> 00:34:00,311
And now, do whatever
you feel you must.

316
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:04,911
It's best if you tell this to the
Führer yourself. Come along.

317
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:24,411
You can't pass, Oberst.
- Orders from brigade führer Mohnke:

318
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:27,611
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

319
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:30,811
There's nobody left.
They all took off.

320
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:33,911
And the wounded?
- How should I know?

321
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:36,511
I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.

322
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:40,811
Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.

323
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:46,311
See that? That's where the Reich 
ends. Behind it, is Russkie land.

324
00:34:58,411 --> 00:34:59,811
May I?

325
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:10,511
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

326
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:15,611
I should have been back by now. Are 
you sure the Führer still needs me?

327
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:19,411
Drink.
- Führer's orders.

328
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,911
You made a big impression
on the Führer.

329
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:25,611
But you don't think Steiner
will attack, do you?

330
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:28,711
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything ...

331
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:31,811
but you probably know that
better than I do.

332
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:36,011
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin is lost.

333
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:47,811
The Führer was impressed
with your report.

334
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:52,411
He puts you in command of
the defence of Berlin.

335
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:58,111
I'd have preferred it
if he executed me.

336
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:21,311
Let them get closer.

337
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:24,211
Tank alert.

338
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:29,011
Take it easy. Wait, kid.
They're still too far.

339
00:38:19,511 --> 00:38:22,511
Is it German artillery that I hear?
- I'm afraid not.

340
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:25,211
But hasn't Steiner's
attack started?

341
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:31,411
You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.

342
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:34,011
But the Führer has
the situation under control.

343
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:36,711
Steiner will make
all the difference.

344
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:40,811
He says it will change
military history.

345
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:44,911
Everybody, but the Führer, knows
that's a fantasy.

346
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:50,611
I even wonder if he believes it himself.
- Why would he be playing games?

347
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:52,811
What does he have to lose?

348
00:38:54,511 --> 00:38:55,511
I don't believe a word of it.

349
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:59,111
The enemy made a breakthrough.

350
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:03,211
They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.

351
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:07,411
They're at the northern city border,
between Frohnau and Pankow.

352
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:13,011
In the east, they reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

353
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:16,811
If Steiner attacks,
everything will be alright.

354
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:22,011
Mein Führer ...

355
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:25,211
Steiner ...

356
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:29,311
Steiner didn't have enough force.

357
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:32,411
The attack didn't take place.

358
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:54,311
The following stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

359
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:14,211
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

360
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:19,011
How dare you
ignore my orders?

361
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,711
Is this what it came to?

362
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:30,411
The military, everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.

363
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:36,111
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

364
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:38,911
I don't allow that ...

365
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:44,011
Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
- Führer, this is outrageous.

366
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:48,211
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

367
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:51,411
No sense of honour.

368
00:40:52,011 --> 00:40:56,011
You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy ...

369
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:59,711
where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.

370
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:04,311
For years, the military
obstructed me.

371
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:09,011
All you ever did is
thwart me.

372
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,911
I should have had ...

373
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:18,111
all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

374
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:25,511
I never went to the academy.

375
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:32,111
But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.

376
00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:38,711
Traitors.

377
00:41:39,211 --> 00:41:43,811
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.

378
00:41:44,411 --> 00:41:49,011
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

379
00:41:50,311 --> 00:41:55,311
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

380
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:58,411
They will drown
in their own blood.

381
00:42:01,111 --> 00:42:02,611
Calm, Gerda.

382
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:13,711
All my orders have
been ignored.

383
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:19,411
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

384
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,311
It's over.

385
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,411
The war is lost.

386
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:40,111
But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin ...

387
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:44,711
you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

388
00:42:49,711 --> 00:42:51,711
Do what you want.

389
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:16,111
The Führer wasn't serious about
killing himself, was he?

390
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:19,311
Frau Junge, Frau Christian.

391
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:27,611
Get changed. In one hour,
a plane will take you south.

392
00:43:29,311 --> 00:43:31,311
Everything is lost.

393
00:43:31,811 --> 00:43:33,811
Completely lost.

394
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:41,111
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

395
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:55,611
I'm staying too, mein Führer.

396
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:21,211
Now what?

397
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:23,811
Time to end this charade.

398
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:28,911
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

399
00:44:29,611 --> 00:44:34,611
The Führer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

400
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:38,811
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.

401
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:42,511
Nobody can replace him.
He's the Führer.

402
00:44:43,211 --> 00:44:45,211
The Führer's confused.
He'll recover.

403
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,811
Great. And then what?

404
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:54,511
No capitulation. That was
never his intention.

405
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:58,211
We owe it to him.
- Hollow phrases.

406
00:44:58,811 --> 00:45:00,811
We have to act now.
Or it will be too late.

407
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:04,411
You're only looking after yourself.
- Mind your words.

408
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,211
Damn.

409
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:24,111
We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.

410
00:45:24,711 --> 00:45:25,711
We've got to wait.

411
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:29,711
Even the Führer doesn't believe in 
it anymore. What will happen to us?

412
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:34,511
Günsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

413
00:45:35,711 --> 00:45:38,111
Why did you say
you wanted to stay with him?

414
00:45:38,811 --> 00:45:42,211
I don't know.
Honestly.

415
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:47,511
It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.

416
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,911
Traudl.

417
00:46:31,511 --> 00:46:33,011
Look here.

418
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:58,011
I'm lighting another one.

419
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:18,511
Let's go down again.

420
00:47:48,711 --> 00:47:52,711
Where do they come from?
- Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

421
00:47:53,311 --> 00:47:55,811
They have to get
out of the field of fire.

422
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:03,611
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

423
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,411
I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.

424
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:13,111
I'll take the responsibility.

425
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:27,811
I think this is wrong.
- Great.

426
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:31,011
Stop. Lights out.

427
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:34,111
Stop. Stay where you are.

428
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,711
Stay where you are.
- Alright, Germans.

429
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:45,911
Help. They want to kill us.
- What is all this?

430
00:48:46,111 --> 00:48:50,111
A Greifkommando.
- You're kidding.

431
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:03,211
Stop it. Let those men go.

432
00:49:03,811 --> 00:49:06,811
What's this?
You have no authority here.

433
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:12,011
These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.

434
00:49:12,711 --> 00:49:16,211
They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.

435
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:23,611
Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?

436
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:27,811
Stop it. That's enough.

437
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:43,411
Dismissed.

438
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:29,111
This man's a doctor.

439
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:39,011
Can you operate?
- Not really.

440
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:46,211
Don't let the children
take too many toys.

441
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:49,911
And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.

442
00:51:50,611 --> 00:51:53,611
Herr Minister ...
- Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.

443
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:58,211
Can you look after them 
for a moment? Thank you.

444
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:00,411
Brigade führer, 
what can I do for you?

445
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:04,011
Your Volkssturm is an easy prey
for the Russians.

446
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:07,111
They have neither combat 
experience nor good weapons.

447
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:12,811
Their unconditional belief in the 
final victory makes up for that.

448
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:17,511
Herr Minister, without weapons
these men can't fight.

449
00:52:18,211 --> 00:52:19,711
Their deaths will be pointless.

450
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:22,811
I don't pity them.

451
00:52:24,511 --> 00:52:27,011
I repeat:
I don't pity them.

452
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,111
The people called this
upon themselves.

453
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:34,711
This may come as a surprise 
to you. Don't fool yourself.

454
00:52:35,411 --> 00:52:38,911
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

455
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:42,611
And now they're paying for it.

456
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:02,311
Eva, you have to leave the Führer.

457
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,811
Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.

458
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:07,511
How can you say that?
Where are you?

459
00:53:08,711 --> 00:53:11,111
I decided
not to die in Berlin.

460
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:16,211
Does my sister know where you are?
- Think about it. I'll call you back.

461
00:53:18,511 --> 00:53:21,111
Children, your room is to the right.

462
00:53:23,311 --> 00:53:24,711
Wait for me.

463
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,811
Hello, Frau Goebbels.
- Good to see you, Frau Junge.

464
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,511
Line up, children.

465
00:53:45,011 --> 00:53:47,011
Helga, come. Line up.

466
00:53:48,111 --> 00:53:52,711
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.

467
00:53:57,111 --> 00:53:59,111
Do you remember the song?

468
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:42,811
The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.

469
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:50,111
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.

470
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:53,811
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

471
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:57,411
If I have to die,
at least without any pain.

472
00:54:58,111 --> 00:54:59,611
That's definitely painless.

473
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:04,611
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

474
00:55:05,411 --> 00:55:06,911
A matter of seconds.

475
00:55:09,011 --> 00:55:12,011
Can I have one too?
- Me too.

476
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:21,811
Himmler provided me well.

477
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:41,911
Thank you.

478
00:55:43,011 --> 00:55:47,511
I would have liked to give you
a nicer present.

479
00:55:55,611 --> 00:55:59,611
Berlin, 23 April 1945.

480
00:56:03,411 --> 00:56:08,411
Dear sister. I'm sorry
to write you this.

481
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:13,711
But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

482
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:17,411
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

483
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:21,511
But I'm sure
you'll see him again.

484
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:27,211
He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.

485
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:31,411
The Führer lost all hope
of a good outcome.

486
00:56:33,111 --> 00:56:36,611
Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.

487
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:42,311
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

488
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:46,611
I stayed with daddy
against his will.

489
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:50,211
Last Sunday, the Führer
wanted to help me escape.

490
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:53,411
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

491
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:57,511
I won't even think about it. Our 
ideology's going down the drain ...

492
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:03,211
and with it, everything that made 
life beautiful and worthwhile.

493
00:57:03,911 --> 00:57:07,911
After the Führer and National Socialism,
there's nothing left to live for.

494
00:57:09,111 --> 00:57:11,611
That's why I brought
the children too.

495
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:14,311
They're too good for the life
that awaits them.

496
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:19,411
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

497
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:31,411
I'll wear my bracelet with the 
green stone until the very end.

498
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:37,111
After that, I want
you to always wear it.

499
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:42,311
Unfortunately, my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.

500
00:57:43,011 --> 00:57:47,011
I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

501
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:49,711
I want you to get it.

502
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:54,911
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

503
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:58,011
A birthday present
from the Führer.

504
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:03,211
I owe some money
to the Heise company.

505
00:58:04,411 --> 00:58:09,011
There may be more debts, but
no more than 1,500 Reichsmarks.

506
00:58:10,911 --> 00:58:16,911
All correspondence with
the Führer must be burnt.

507
00:58:19,211 --> 00:58:25,211
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.

508
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:31,511
The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for daddy, the chocolate for mummy.

509
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:36,911
I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.

510
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:41,611
Dear sister, I wish
you lots of happiness.

511
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:45,711
And remember,
you will see Hermann again.

512
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:49,911
The warmest regards
and a kiss from ...

513
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:52,111
your sister.

514
00:59:43,811 --> 00:59:45,811
Inge.

515
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:40,411
Listen, Keitel.
I want you to leave this evening.

516
01:00:41,111 --> 01:00:44,611
Go to Dönitz and help him
with the organisation.

517
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:48,311
Things have to be
started up again.

518
01:00:50,011 --> 01:00:52,011
I don't understand you.

519
01:00:52,611 --> 01:00:56,111
We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.

520
01:00:56,811 --> 01:01:02,311
It makes any serious operation
impossible.

521
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:09,011
When everything has been solved
here, we must get the oil fields back.

522
01:01:14,011 --> 01:01:17,011
Any questions?
- No, mein Führer.

523
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:20,111
Good.
Have a good trip.

524
01:02:46,811 --> 01:02:49,811
Mein Führer! Is it agreeable to 
you after your decision ...

525
01:02:49,911 --> 01:02:53,311
to remain in the fortified zone of 
Berlin as your representative ...

526
01:02:53,411 --> 01:02:56,911
do you agree that I take charge ...

527
01:02:57,611 --> 01:03:00,611
with complete freedom of action?

528
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:03,311
If I receive no reply
by 22:00 hours ...

529
01:03:03,911 --> 01:03:06,811
I'll assume you have
been incapacitated.

530
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:10,911
I will then act on behalf of 
the country and the motherland.

531
01:03:12,111 --> 01:03:14,611
That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.

532
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:17,711
Göring's concerns are not
entirely unjustified.

533
01:03:18,411 --> 01:03:21,411
If our communication
system fails ...

534
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:25,011
we'll be cut off
from the outside world.

535
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:27,711
We won't be able
to issue orders anymore.

536
01:03:28,311 --> 01:03:30,811
I think Göring wants to
seize the power.

537
01:03:31,911 --> 01:03:34,411
I never trusted his clique
on the Obersalzberg.

538
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,111
This looks like a coup.

539
01:03:37,611 --> 01:03:41,111
The loser, the sponger.

540
01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:44,311
A parvenu, a lazy bastard.

541
01:03:45,611 --> 01:03:50,111
How dare he say
I'm incapacitated?

542
01:03:51,311 --> 01:03:54,311
Hello.
- How did you get into Berlin?

543
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:57,511
It wasn't easy,
but I must speak to the Führer.

544
01:03:58,611 --> 01:04:00,611
If I were you,
I'd wait a bit.

545
01:04:01,211 --> 01:04:04,211
The Luftwaffe.
What did he turn that into?

546
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:07,911
For that alone,
he should be executed.

547
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:14,011
This morphine addict
corrupted the country.

548
01:04:15,311 --> 01:04:16,811
And now this.

549
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:20,411
He's betraying me.

550
01:04:22,111 --> 01:04:25,111
Me of all people.

551
01:04:25,211 --> 01:04:35,211
I want Göring stripped
of his power, right away.

552
01:04:36,711 --> 01:04:39,211
And, in case I don't
survive the war ...

553
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:42,811
he must be
executed immediately.

554
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:49,511
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

555
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:55,311
Frau Junge, leave from
here before it's too late.

556
01:04:56,011 --> 01:04:59,911
The Führer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind, can we?

557
01:05:00,111 --> 01:05:05,611
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.

558
01:05:06,911 --> 01:05:10,911
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.

559
01:05:20,511 --> 01:05:22,511
But the children ...

560
01:05:26,211 --> 01:05:28,211
I have always believed ...

561
01:05:29,811 --> 01:05:32,811
that there was a way out.

562
01:05:39,711 --> 01:05:41,711
Come in.

563
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:45,911
Albert. Hello.

564
01:05:57,511 --> 01:05:59,511
You have a fever.

565
01:06:00,111 --> 01:06:03,111
Albert, I can't stand
it anymore.

566
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:07,811
Why don't you leave with
the children, Magda?

567
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:10,911
Leave?
And go where?

568
01:06:11,611 --> 01:06:16,111
I can arrange for you to be
taken to Schwanenwerder by barge.

569
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:20,311
You can hide
until everything's over.

570
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:22,911
It won't be long now anyway.

571
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:25,511
I thought about it.

572
01:06:27,211 --> 01:06:32,211
My children cannot grow up in a 
world without National Socialism.

573
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:40,011
Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.

574
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:48,911
If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.

575
01:07:05,611 --> 01:07:08,011
I can't believe
you really want that.

576
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:12,811
Go now.

577
01:07:43,711 --> 01:07:45,711
Come in.

578
01:07:50,011 --> 01:07:52,011
I knew you'd come.

579
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:55,611
You wouldn't desert
the Führer.

580
01:07:59,811 --> 01:08:05,211
I've come to say goodbye to the Führer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

581
01:08:06,011 --> 01:08:08,411
Of course, you must go.
Sit down.

582
01:08:11,311 --> 01:08:14,311
I took some furniture
you designed.

583
01:08:14,411 --> 01:08:16,811
I couldn't leave it behind.

584
01:08:17,411 --> 01:08:21,411
Please, you must
not have eaten all day.

585
01:08:22,611 --> 01:08:24,111
That's true.

586
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:33,911
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

587
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,611
Did he ever doubt that?

588
01:08:38,311 --> 01:08:41,811
Lately, he often thought
you were against him too.

589
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:45,911
I always said you'd come
and here you are.

590
01:08:50,811 --> 01:08:54,311
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

591
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,911
I also think it's best.

592
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:02,211
And, you know ...

593
01:09:03,311 --> 01:09:05,311
it may sound strange ...

594
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:12,511
but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.

595
01:09:39,511 --> 01:09:44,011
You came.
- Mein Führer, I ...

596
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:46,211
It's good.

597
01:09:47,811 --> 01:09:49,311
Let's sit down.

598
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:12,311
I had great plans
for the Germans and the world.

599
01:10:14,111 --> 01:10:19,111
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

600
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:29,511
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

601
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:34,311
Too late.

602
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:45,611
I can only be proud for openly
fighting the Jews ...

603
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:51,411
and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.

604
01:10:56,211 --> 01:11:00,211
I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment ...

605
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:10,411
and then eternal peace.

606
01:11:15,011 --> 01:11:19,211
But please spare the people,
mein Führer.

607
01:11:19,511 --> 01:11:23,711
If my people cannot endure
this ordeal ...

608
01:11:23,811 --> 01:11:26,811
I won't shed a tear.

609
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:29,511
They get what they deserve.

610
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:35,611
They called this fate
upon themselves.

611
01:11:41,111 --> 01:11:43,111
For months ...

612
01:11:44,711 --> 01:11:46,711
I have to tell you this ...

613
01:11:48,411 --> 01:11:51,911
for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

614
01:11:54,111 --> 01:12:00,611
I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.

615
01:12:06,111 --> 01:12:07,611
I had to tell you.

616
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:20,911
This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.

617
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:36,811
So you're leaving.

618
01:12:38,211 --> 01:12:39,711
Good.

619
01:12:40,311 --> 01:12:41,811
Goodbye.

620
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,411
I wish you all the best.

621
01:13:17,511 --> 01:13:21,011
Eat well, gentlemen.

622
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,411
Peter.

623
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:30,111
It's alright, son.

624
01:14:47,011 --> 01:14:48,511
He has a fever.

625
01:14:50,711 --> 01:14:51,711
Yes, but he's alive.

626
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:20,711
Loyalty and courage
still exist in this world.

627
01:15:21,311 --> 01:15:24,311
Ritter von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch, how good ...

628
01:15:27,511 --> 01:15:31,511
that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

629
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:33,711
Sit down.

630
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:38,411
We came under heavy fire, but
still arrived in Gatow.

631
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:41,611
From there,
we couldn't continue.

632
01:15:42,711 --> 01:15:46,711
We flew in a Fieseler Storch,
over the Russian lines ...

633
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:50,411
and landed on the
East-West axis, close to here.

634
01:15:51,011 --> 01:15:53,511
Before landing, the Soviets
had a go at us.

635
01:15:55,311 --> 01:15:59,811
General Von Greim, I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.

636
01:16:01,011 --> 01:16:03,511
I hereby promote you
to General-Feldmarschall.

637
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:07,311
A big responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

638
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:10,911
You have to rebuild the
Luftwaffe from scratch.

639
01:16:11,511 --> 01:16:14,011
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

640
01:16:15,711 --> 01:16:18,711
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

641
01:16:20,911 --> 01:16:26,411
This so-called humanity
is religious drivel.

642
01:16:28,211 --> 01:16:33,211
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak ...

643
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:35,511
is a betrayal of nature.

644
01:16:36,611 --> 01:16:41,611
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

645
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:45,911
Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.

646
01:16:50,111 --> 01:16:54,111
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal ...

647
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:58,711
opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

648
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:03,011
Apes, for instance ...

649
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:08,611
kill all the odd ones.

650
01:17:09,311 --> 01:17:14,811
And what applies to apes,
must definitely apply to humans.

651
01:17:21,311 --> 01:17:23,311
Himmler made an offer to surrender ...

652
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:28,911
to the allied powers.

653
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:31,111
Via Count Bernadotte.

654
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,811
A message from the English radio.

655
01:17:40,611 --> 01:17:45,611
Himmler.
Himmler of all people.

656
01:17:46,811 --> 01:17:53,811
The most loyal of my loyals.
That's the worst betrayal.

657
01:17:58,111 --> 01:18:01,911
Göring, he was corrupt.
Always has been.

658
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:08,911
Speer, an absent-minded artist.
All the others: yes.

659
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:15,211
But Himmler?
Has he gone insane?

660
01:18:15,911 --> 01:18:19,911
He must have told
them I'm sick.

661
01:18:20,611 --> 01:18:22,611
Maybe even dead.

662
01:18:29,011 --> 01:18:33,511
Leave me alone with Ritter Von Greim
and Fräulein Reitsch.

663
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:39,711
And get Fegelein.
- We don't know where he is.

664
01:18:40,411 --> 01:18:43,911
What? He's Himmler's assistant.
He must be available.

665
01:18:44,111 --> 01:18:48,611
We haven't seen him for days.
- I want a report immediately.

666
01:18:51,911 --> 01:18:53,411
Please stay here, Doctor.

667
01:18:58,711 --> 01:19:02,711
You and Greim must go as quickly
as possible. Fly to Dönitz.

668
01:19:03,011 --> 01:19:08,911
Tell him to do anything
it takes to punish Himmler.

669
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:13,611
We've decided to
die with you.

670
01:19:16,411 --> 01:19:18,911
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

671
01:19:20,611 --> 01:19:24,111
But Himmler must die.
He committed treason.

672
01:19:24,311 --> 01:19:28,711
He's no longer privvy
to my plans.

673
01:19:29,411 --> 01:19:30,411
Mein Führer?

674
01:19:31,011 --> 01:19:34,511
Do you think I'll sit and wait until
those Jewish swine slaughter me?

675
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:39,211
This is part of a huge decoy operation.
I've allowed the enemy ...

676
01:19:39,511 --> 01:19:44,411
to invade the Reich and they
think they've won.

677
01:19:45,111 --> 01:19:48,611
But mark my words: they have
another thing coming.

678
01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:52,711
Dönitz is mobilising in the north.
Kesselring in the south.

679
01:19:53,411 --> 01:19:57,411
We'll surround the enemy
and crush them.

680
01:19:58,111 --> 01:20:03,111
From Prague, three armies will attack the 
Russians, simultaneously, from the back.

681
01:20:03,911 --> 01:20:08,911
I didn't know we still had
so many reserve troops.

682
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:13,611
I made sure you'll soon have
a 1,000 of the most modern ...

683
01:20:13,911 --> 01:20:17,811
jets at your disposal.

684
01:20:18,511 --> 01:20:22,511
With those, you can make the
Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

685
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:27,611
I kneel to your genius, at the
altar of the motherland.

686
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:44,311
Heil, mein Führer.

687
01:20:47,411 --> 01:20:50,411
You also request to leave Berlin?

688
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:56,111
Mein Führer, as you know,
all medical departments ...

689
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:59,811
that fall under the SS and Himmler,
have left Berlin.

690
01:21:01,011 --> 01:21:05,011
Himmler is a traitor.
He won't escape punishment.

691
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:10,411
Mein Führer, as Reichsarzt SS,
I have no more work here.

692
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:15,111
Your request to leave Berlin
is unacceptable.

693
01:21:16,811 --> 01:21:18,811
My family ...

694
01:21:20,511 --> 01:21:23,511
If the Russians ...
I must leave.

695
01:21:24,111 --> 01:21:25,611
You did nothing wrong.

696
01:21:26,811 --> 01:21:31,811
Future generations will thank you
for you medical research.

697
01:21:32,511 --> 01:21:34,511
I take all the responsibility.

698
01:21:40,811 --> 01:21:43,311
We'll talk about it later.

699
01:21:57,711 --> 01:22:01,711
Gruppenführer Fegelein cannot
be found. He's not in the bunker.

700
01:22:02,511 --> 01:22:04,911
What, you can't find Fegelein?

701
01:22:06,111 --> 01:22:10,111
Keep searching.
I need to talk to him. Immediately.

702
01:22:11,311 --> 01:22:15,311
If he left just like that,
that's desertion. Treason.

703
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:17,511
Bring me Fegelein.

704
01:22:18,211 --> 01:22:20,611
Fegelein. Fegelein.

705
01:22:32,211 --> 01:22:35,211
Daddy, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

706
01:22:38,511 --> 01:22:43,011
Ernst, is something wrong?
- No.

707
01:22:43,711 --> 01:22:45,211
Thank you.

708
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:47,311
Brigitte is hungry too.

709
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:52,911
Ilse, you should
eat something as well.

710
01:22:55,211 --> 01:22:57,211
Thank you.
- There you go.

711
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,511
Thank you.

712
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:01,111
What is it?
- Gruppenführer, you're under arrest.

713
01:24:02,311 --> 01:24:03,811
What?
- You're suspected of desertion.

714
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:06,411
Get dressed.
You'll come with us.

715
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:13,211
Search the room.

716
01:24:13,811 --> 01:24:16,811
Let go of me.
You can't give me orders.

717
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:22,011
You can't have Hermann
executed, can you?

718
01:24:22,711 --> 01:24:25,911
There's no doubt.
He wanted to flee.

719
01:24:26,111 --> 01:24:29,311
What does it matter?
Everything's over.

720
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:33,011
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant by Hermann.

721
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:36,611
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

722
01:24:39,911 --> 01:24:44,911
There's no mercy for traitors.
No compassion for them.

723
01:24:47,211 --> 01:24:50,211
He'll be court-martialled
and executed.

724
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:53,311
What's the point of that?

725
01:24:55,511 --> 01:24:57,011
It is my wish.

726
01:25:10,911 --> 01:25:11,911
You're the Führer.

727
01:25:15,811 --> 01:25:16,811
Speak.

728
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:19,911
The Russians are advancing
more and more.

729
01:25:20,511 --> 01:25:23,511
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.

730
01:25:24,211 --> 01:25:26,711
There is no ammunition coming
in anymore.

731
01:25:31,011 --> 01:25:33,511
In the north, the Russians are standing
in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

732
01:25:34,111 --> 01:25:37,111
In the east: Lustgarten.
South: Potsdammer Platz.

733
01:25:37,711 --> 01:25:41,211
West: Tiergarten, about 400 metres
away from the chancellery.

734
01:25:42,411 --> 01:25:45,411
How long can you hold out?
- At most, two days.

735
01:25:46,611 --> 01:25:49,111
Including the government area?
- Yes.

736
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:55,311
As a soldier, I suggest we
flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

737
01:25:56,011 --> 01:26:02,011
The battle of Berlin killed about
20,000 of our best officers.

738
01:26:02,311 --> 01:26:05,711
That's what young people are for.

739
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:09,911
What you suggest is insane.
Ridiculous.

740
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:13,611
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them.

741
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:18,211
Mein Führer, the orders have 
been written. I give you my word ...

742
01:26:18,911 --> 01:26:23,411
The Führer cannot make a honourless
disappearance from world history.

743
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:28,111
Even if an advance is successful ...

744
01:26:28,811 --> 01:26:31,811
I'll end up in another
troublesome situation.

745
01:26:32,511 --> 01:26:37,511
I'd have to stay in the open air
or on a farm ...

746
01:26:38,211 --> 01:26:39,711
and wait for the end.

747
01:26:41,311 --> 01:26:46,811
Wenck is advancing with the 
12th army. He can join the 9th ...

748
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:51,411
and give the Russians
the final blow.

749
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:56,311
Wenck's an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:

750
01:26:59,611 --> 01:27:05,111
Immediately report to me the following:
1. Where are Wenck's vanguard located?

751
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:08,911
2. When will they attack again?

752
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:15,511
3. Where is the 9th army?
4. Where will the 9th make a breakthrough?

753
01:27:17,811 --> 01:27:22,311
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be right.

754
01:27:23,111 --> 01:27:25,611
Wenck will come.

755
01:27:32,111 --> 01:27:34,111
Wenck will come.

756
01:27:47,511 --> 01:27:51,511
I want to know if Wenck
can do anything at all.

757
01:27:52,111 --> 01:27:56,611
It's unlikely that Wenck's
small amount of troops ...

758
01:27:57,411 --> 01:28:01,911
What's unlikely about the offensive?
- Wenck can't do anything anymore.

759
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:06,611
Then why don't you tell the Führer 
that? Has everybody gone mad?

760
01:28:07,311 --> 01:28:10,311
Do you think the Führer doesn't 
know? He'll never surrender.

761
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:14,411
And neither will we. I've been
through that once. Never again.

762
01:28:15,111 --> 01:28:17,111
Come along. I have to go.

763
01:28:27,311 --> 01:28:28,811
Stop right there.

764
01:28:40,911 --> 01:28:42,411
Heil Hitler.

765
01:29:31,211 --> 01:29:33,711
Excuse me. I fell asleep.

766
01:29:34,311 --> 01:29:36,311
Did you get some rest, my child?

767
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:42,011
In shorthand.

768
01:29:48,311 --> 01:29:51,811
My political will.

769
01:29:53,011 --> 01:29:58,011
More than 30 years have passed ...

770
01:29:58,211 --> 01:30:02,711
since I made my contribution
as a volunteer ...

771
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:06,911
during the first World War.

772
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:12,611
During those 30 years,
I learnt to think, act and live ...

773
01:30:13,311 --> 01:30:16,311
out of love and loyalty
for my people.

774
01:30:20,411 --> 01:30:23,911
Excuse me. The shooting.
- Please sit down.

775
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:30,211
Centuries will pass ...

776
01:30:31,011 --> 01:30:35,011
but from the ruins
of our cities and monuments ...

777
01:30:35,111 --> 01:30:40,511
the hatred of the people ...

778
01:30:40,811 --> 01:30:43,811
who did this to us,
will continue to flare up.

779
01:30:44,511 --> 01:30:48,511
International Judaism and
its allies.

780
01:30:59,811 --> 01:31:01,811
What is it, Herr Minister?

781
01:31:05,611 --> 01:31:08,111
Imagine this. The Führer wants 
me to leave Berlin.

782
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:11,211
He ordered it.

783
01:31:13,411 --> 01:31:16,911
I've never ignored an order
from the Führer.

784
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:31,211
But I will ignore this order.
I'll stay with the Führer.

785
01:31:35,211 --> 01:31:37,211
Please, Frau Junge ...

786
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:42,411
I want to dictate my will to you.

787
01:31:44,611 --> 01:31:47,611
I'm typing
the Führer's will.

788
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:50,711
Good.

789
01:31:51,911 --> 01:31:54,411
I understand.
Some other time.

790
01:32:01,711 --> 01:32:06,711
Mein Führer, according to the 
racial law I'm obliged to ask you:

791
01:32:07,411 --> 01:32:09,911
Mein Führer, are you
of Aryan descent?

792
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:17,411
Can I see your identity card?

793
01:32:18,711 --> 01:32:21,711
You're talking to the Führer here.
- Alright then.

794
01:32:22,311 --> 01:32:25,811
And you, Fräulein Braun,
are you of Aryan descent?

795
01:32:26,811 --> 01:32:29,811
Then there's nothing
to stop us.

796
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:33,911
I'm asking you now:
Do you, mein Führer, Adolf Hitler ...

797
01:32:34,611 --> 01:32:39,611
take Eva Braun, present here,
as your wife? Answer 'yes'.

798
01:32:41,911 --> 01:32:45,411
Do you, Eva Braun, take Führer
Adolf Hitler, present here ...

799
01:32:46,111 --> 01:32:49,111
as your husband? Answer 'yes'.

800
01:32:50,811 --> 01:32:53,811
Then I declare you
man and wife.

801
01:33:33,211 --> 01:33:35,211
Two men here.

802
01:33:37,611 --> 01:33:39,111
Everything will be alright.

803
01:33:41,111 --> 01:33:43,611
You must go to the Führer right away.
- Now?

804
01:34:03,511 --> 01:34:07,511
How long can we hold out?
- Twenty hours, no more.

805
01:34:09,211 --> 01:34:14,711
The Russians are close. At the 
moment, we forced them to stop.

806
01:34:15,511 --> 01:34:20,511
You know, Mohnke. The western
democracies are decadent.

807
01:34:21,211 --> 01:34:26,211
They'll succumb to
the people from the east.

808
01:34:29,511 --> 01:34:32,011
All the best. Thank you.

809
01:34:33,211 --> 01:34:36,211
It wasn't just for Germany.

810
01:34:56,211 --> 01:34:58,211
A message from Keitel.

811
01:35:01,411 --> 01:35:04,611
1. Wenck's vanguard are
stuck south of Schwielowsee.

812
01:35:05,311 --> 01:35:08,811
2. The 12th army can't continue
the attack on Berlin.

813
01:35:10,011 --> 01:35:13,511
3. The 9th army is
completely surrounded.

814
01:35:33,611 --> 01:35:38,611
What do we do when the last
ammunition reserves have been exhausted?

815
01:35:39,811 --> 01:35:42,811
I'll never surrender. Never.

816
01:35:45,011 --> 01:35:50,011
I forbid you, and the other
commanders, to surrender.

817
01:36:02,211 --> 01:36:07,711
Listen, Günsche. My wife and I
are going to commit suicide.

818
01:36:08,511 --> 01:36:12,511
I don't want my corpse
exposed by the Russians.

819
01:36:13,211 --> 01:36:16,211
I don't want them to get me,
dead or alive.

820
01:36:16,811 --> 01:36:20,311
I want to be burnt
and never to be found.

821
01:36:24,611 --> 01:36:27,611
Günsche, I want you 
to promise me ...

822
01:36:28,311 --> 01:36:33,311
that you will do
all that it takes.

823
01:36:34,011 --> 01:36:36,011
Mein Führer ...

824
01:36:36,111 --> 01:36:40,111
this is a terrible order,
but I will execute it.

825
01:37:07,611 --> 01:37:10,611
Kempka.
- Erich, I need 200 litres of petrol.

826
01:37:10,711 --> 01:37:14,211
Are you mad?
Where should I find them?

827
01:37:14,911 --> 01:37:16,911
From the parked vehicles.

828
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:20,511
What's all that petrol for?
- I can't say.

829
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:40,311
Come, please.
The Führer wants to see us.

830
01:37:49,911 --> 01:37:52,411
Should I tell the Führer
you're indisposed?

831
01:37:53,611 --> 01:37:56,611
It's only my collapsed lung.

832
01:37:58,711 --> 01:38:00,711
I'll die soon anyway.

833
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:48,411
Excuse me.

834
01:39:01,111 --> 01:39:03,111
Over here, Herr Professor.

835
01:39:12,111 --> 01:39:14,611
One moment, please.

836
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:25,411
Excuse me.

837
01:39:58,911 --> 01:40:02,911
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

838
01:40:03,611 --> 01:40:07,611
Mein Führer, keep faith
in the final victory.

839
01:40:08,311 --> 01:40:12,811
Lead us
and we shall follow.

840
01:40:16,811 --> 01:40:18,411
Come along.

841
01:40:25,611 --> 01:40:27,611
Join the gang.

842
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:32,511
Come. Have a drink.

843
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:37,011
Besides drinking, there's little we can do.
- Do sit down.

844
01:40:37,811 --> 01:40:44,211
That's better. Yes, the 
situation is pretty shitty.

845
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:52,311
Can we sit down?
- Please do, Fräulein ...

846
01:40:52,811 --> 01:40:56,811
Frau ...
- That's Frau Hitler.

847
01:40:59,711 --> 01:41:01,111
It's alright.

848
01:41:03,311 --> 01:41:05,911
A pity we can't go
outside anymore.

849
01:41:06,411 --> 01:41:09,411
Only if you want
to die a heroic death.

850
01:41:10,111 --> 01:41:15,511
Fritz, control yourself a bit.
- Yes. Control.

851
01:41:16,811 --> 01:41:18,411
Take cover.

852
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:43,411
What are you doing here?
- I have to report to the Führer.

853
01:41:44,111 --> 01:41:46,111
You can't right now.
Sit down.

854
01:41:46,611 --> 01:41:48,611
Sit. Drink.

855
01:41:52,911 --> 01:41:54,911
Let me introduce Frau Hitler.

856
01:41:55,011 --> 01:41:59,011
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.

857
01:42:02,311 --> 01:42:04,911
Excuse me.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

858
01:42:06,011 --> 01:42:08,411
You can use our toilet.

859
01:42:16,411 --> 01:42:21,411
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only hit an optic nerve.

860
01:42:22,111 --> 01:42:26,611
That's why it's good
to also take the poison.

861
01:42:27,311 --> 01:42:31,811
When you bite through the capsule,
pull the trigger.

862
01:42:32,511 --> 01:42:34,511
Will I have enough time?

863
01:42:35,611 --> 01:42:38,111
The poison starts working
after one or two seconds.

864
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:58,211
Tornow, you too.

865
01:43:07,311 --> 01:43:08,811
Come Blondi.

866
01:43:40,611 --> 01:43:43,111
You know, Frau Junge,
I've known ...

867
01:43:44,311 --> 01:43:46,811
my husband for
more than 15 years.

868
01:43:47,411 --> 01:43:51,911
But when I think about it,
I know nothing about him.

869
01:43:52,611 --> 01:43:54,611
Even though he likes to talk.

870
01:43:57,811 --> 01:44:02,311
I longed for Berlin,
but he's so different now.

871
01:44:03,011 --> 01:44:06,511
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian food now.

872
01:44:07,211 --> 01:44:09,711
I hate Blondi.

873
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:16,411
I sometimes kick her and Adolf
then wonders why she acts strange.

874
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:30,011
I think he doesn't want anybody
to really know him.

875
01:44:33,311 --> 01:44:37,811
he can be so caring
in his private life.

876
01:44:39,511 --> 01:44:44,011
And then he uses
that rude language again.

877
01:44:45,311 --> 01:44:47,311
When he's the Führer, you mean?

878
01:44:48,911 --> 01:44:51,911
Come, let's smoke another one.

879
01:45:13,811 --> 01:45:15,311
I'm sorry.

880
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:21,511
You have so many worries
and here I am, whining.

881
01:45:22,711 --> 01:45:26,211
Frau Junge, I'm giving you 
this coat as a goodbye present.

882
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:31,911
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.

883
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:35,611
What a surprise. Thank you.

884
01:45:37,311 --> 01:45:40,811
I just don't know where and when
I can wear it.

885
01:45:42,511 --> 01:45:45,511
Please, try to get out of here.

886
01:45:47,211 --> 01:45:48,711
Promise me.

887
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:22,811
Thank you. That was very good,
Fräulein Manziarly.

888
01:47:44,011 --> 01:47:48,011
The time has come. It's finished.

889
01:48:26,911 --> 01:48:28,911
The Führer wants to say goodbye.
Come with me.

890
01:49:01,011 --> 01:49:04,011
You're the bravest mother
of the Reich.

891
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:08,711
Führer, you made me the happiest
woman in Germany.

892
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:34,911
Salute my beautiful Bavaria.

893
01:49:58,711 --> 01:50:00,711
Children, what are you doing here?

894
01:50:01,311 --> 01:50:03,811
We want to see aunt Eva
and uncle Hitler.

895
01:50:04,411 --> 01:50:07,911
Have you eaten anything yet?
- Only breakfast.

896
01:50:09,711 --> 01:50:13,211
Stay here, I'll get something 
to eat. I'll be right back.

897
01:50:22,511 --> 01:50:27,011
Comrades, this is the
latest news from the outside.

898
01:50:27,711 --> 01:50:32,711
Berlin is full of warehouses: There were
houses here, there were houses there.

899
01:50:38,411 --> 01:50:40,411
Herr Günsche,
I want to speak to the Führer.

900
01:50:42,611 --> 01:50:44,111
Please, I have to.

901
01:50:44,711 --> 01:50:47,211
Frau Goebbels, the Führer
doesn't want to be disturbed.

902
01:50:47,311 --> 01:50:50,311
Please, Günsche,
just for a moment.

903
01:50:50,911 --> 01:50:52,411
Please.

904
01:50:59,911 --> 01:51:02,511
Mein Führer, 
Frau Goebbels is here.

905
01:51:09,111 --> 01:51:10,511
What is it?

906
01:51:11,211 --> 01:51:14,611
Mein Führer, I beg you:
Leave Berlin.

907
01:51:15,811 --> 01:51:21,411
Don't leave us Führer.
What will become of us?

908
01:51:25,511 --> 01:51:32,511
Tomorrow, I'll be cursed by 
millions, but that's how it is.

909
01:51:35,611 --> 01:51:37,611
Get up. Come.

910
01:51:40,211 --> 01:51:42,211
Come.

911
01:51:50,611 --> 01:51:53,211
Aunt Traudl, I like it
when it thunders.

912
01:51:53,711 --> 01:51:57,311
Why?
- Nothing can happen to us here.

913
01:51:57,911 --> 01:51:59,911
Can it?
- No.

914
01:52:09,611 --> 01:52:11,111
Gotcha.

915
01:52:34,111 --> 01:52:37,611
Reichsleiter, it's over.

916
01:52:56,611 --> 01:52:59,111
The Führer is dead.

917
01:53:14,911 --> 01:53:16,911
There's daddy.

918
01:53:28,511 --> 01:53:32,011
Are you crazy?
For that damned petrol of yours ...

919
01:53:32,711 --> 01:53:34,711
Erich, shut up.

920
01:53:45,311 --> 01:53:46,711
Stand back.

921
01:54:00,311 --> 01:54:01,711
Come on, continue.

922
01:54:02,411 --> 01:54:03,811
Continue.

923
01:55:33,411 --> 01:55:36,411
No, don't.

924
01:55:37,811 --> 01:55:39,811
Let grandpa go.

925
01:55:46,211 --> 01:55:49,711
Order. Order.
We must have order.

926
01:55:50,911 --> 01:55:53,411
Order has to return.

927
01:56:07,811 --> 01:56:11,811
This way. We know the way.
You can trust us.

928
01:56:13,011 --> 01:56:14,511
Hurry.

929
01:56:21,111 --> 01:56:23,711
I was on the side of
the Red Beasts.

930
01:56:27,711 --> 01:56:29,711
I supported the Bolsheviks.

931
01:56:37,311 --> 01:56:38,811
Let's hope the Russians
got our message.

932
01:56:39,411 --> 01:56:41,911
We'll soon find out.
- Or not.

933
01:56:47,211 --> 01:56:50,211
What news do you have, General?

934
01:56:50,911 --> 01:56:55,911
Adolf Hitler and his wife
committed suicide in the bunker.

935
01:56:59,211 --> 01:57:03,211
The new government
authorised me ...

936
01:57:05,511 --> 01:57:08,511
to start peace talks ...

937
01:57:09,111 --> 01:57:15,111
between our countries, that both
suffered severe losses.

938
01:57:16,411 --> 01:57:20,911
General, if you were me,
would you make peace with you?

939
01:57:21,711 --> 01:57:25,711
My government will never accept
unconditional surrender.

940
01:57:28,411 --> 01:57:32,411
Given the situation,
you have no other choice.

941
01:57:35,711 --> 01:57:38,211
Surrender? Never.
That's shameful.

942
01:57:39,411 --> 01:57:41,411
Years ago, I conquered
Berlin on the Reds ...

943
01:57:42,011 --> 01:57:46,011
and I'll defend the city
to my dying day.

944
01:57:47,211 --> 01:57:49,711
In the short time I have
as Chancellor ...

945
01:57:50,311 --> 01:57:54,311
I'll never sign
a surrender treaty.

946
01:57:55,011 --> 01:57:58,011
It's for the sake of the people.
- The Führer's orders are final.

947
01:57:58,711 --> 01:58:02,211
This is crazy.
We have to start negotiations.

948
01:58:02,811 --> 01:58:05,811
I repeat, gentlemen:
I do not surrender.

949
01:58:07,011 --> 01:58:09,511
Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
- Zhukov?

950
01:58:10,111 --> 01:58:12,611
What's happening?
- We're surrendering.

951
01:58:13,311 --> 01:58:16,311
Then I must kill you.
The Führer forbids any surrender.

952
01:58:36,511 --> 01:58:39,511
How long does it work?
- Around four hours.

953
01:59:16,911 --> 01:59:21,911
Children, the doctor has the 
medication I told you about.

954
01:59:22,511 --> 01:59:25,111
It's a bit bitter,
but it will work.

955
01:59:26,711 --> 01:59:28,311
A sip for everybody.

956
01:59:29,811 --> 01:59:31,811
Who wants to go first?

957
01:59:34,611 --> 01:59:38,011
Heide, you're always so brave?

958
01:59:44,011 --> 01:59:45,411
Have another sip.

959
01:59:48,611 --> 01:59:50,611
See? That wasn't so bad.

960
01:59:55,911 --> 01:59:57,911
Well done.
Helmut.

961
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:05,611
This medication makes sure you don't
get ill in this humid bunker.

962
02:00:06,311 --> 02:00:08,811
But it's not humid
in the bunker.

963
02:00:13,611 --> 02:00:15,111
Well done.

964
02:00:24,411 --> 02:00:25,911
Helga.

965
02:00:28,711 --> 02:00:29,711
I don't want to.

966
02:00:30,311 --> 02:00:34,711
What's that? Do you want to get sick?
- Please, mama. I don't want to drink it.

967
02:00:38,511 --> 02:00:42,511
Don't cry, baby.
That doesn't help.

968
02:00:43,211 --> 02:00:45,211
You have to drink the medicine.

969
02:00:48,911 --> 02:00:50,411
Helga.

970
02:00:56,211 --> 02:00:58,711
Come on, open your mouth.

971
02:01:20,211 --> 02:01:21,711
Goodnight, children.

972
02:01:32,511 --> 02:01:35,411
One day the lie will fall apart ...

973
02:01:35,711 --> 02:01:38,711
and there will be light
in the darkness.

974
02:01:39,811 --> 02:01:41,311
Please read that.

975
02:01:42,411 --> 02:01:46,911
One day the lie will fall apart
and there will be light in the darkness.

976
02:01:48,711 --> 02:01:51,711
Let's do it differently.
One day the lie will collapse ...

977
02:01:52,311 --> 02:01:56,811
and truth will triumph
once again.

978
02:01:57,611 --> 02:02:01,111
At that moment, we will
stand above everybody ...

979
02:02:01,711 --> 02:02:03,711
pure and ...

980
02:02:06,911 --> 02:02:08,911
immaculate.

981
02:06:15,911 --> 02:06:18,911
We don't stand a chance.
- So what? I want to get away.

982
02:06:19,611 --> 02:06:21,111
How do we get
through the lines?

983
02:06:21,711 --> 02:06:24,211
Doesn't matter.
I'm not staying another minute.

984
02:06:24,811 --> 02:06:27,811
We'll die.
- It won't be that bad, surely.

985
02:06:29,011 --> 02:06:31,511
If we stay, the Russians
will get us for sure.

986
02:06:33,711 --> 02:06:34,711
All the best.

987
02:06:35,211 --> 02:06:37,211
Come, let's go.

988
02:08:06,211 --> 02:08:12,611
On 30 April 1945, the Führer
committed suicide ...

989
02:08:12,811 --> 02:08:18,411
and in doing so, he deserted
everybody who was loyal to him.

990
02:08:19,111 --> 02:08:24,111
You, German soldiers, were loyal to
the Führer and were prepared ...

991
02:08:24,911 --> 02:08:30,911
to continue the battle for Berlin, 
although  ammunition was in short supply ...

992
02:08:31,611 --> 02:08:36,211
and further resistance
was pointless.

993
02:08:36,811 --> 02:08:40,411
I hereby declare an
immediate cease-fire.

994
02:08:42,011 --> 02:08:44,611
Each hour you continue fighting ...

995
02:08:45,211 --> 02:08:51,811
prolongs the suffering of the people
of Berlin and of our wounded.

996
02:08:52,511 --> 02:08:56,111
In agreement with the supreme
command of the Soviet troops ...

997
02:08:56,611 --> 02:09:02,211
I order you to stop
fighting immediately.

998
02:09:02,911 --> 02:09:09,911
Weidling, former commander
of the Berlin defence area.

999
02:09:11,911 --> 02:09:13,911
A glass of water, please.

1000
02:10:19,611 --> 02:10:22,011
I don't need you anymore.

1001
02:10:25,311 --> 02:10:27,911
The game's over.

1002
02:11:35,611 --> 02:11:38,111
It's time.
- Don't you see what's going on here?

1003
02:11:38,911 --> 02:11:41,811
I insist that you help us,
as a doctor.

1004
02:11:43,111 --> 02:11:45,111
Alright, then.

1005
02:11:52,311 --> 02:11:56,811
Go. You did a lot.
Thank you.

1006
02:12:03,811 --> 02:12:09,711
Schädle, hurry. Come on.
- I'm not going anywhere anymore.

1007
02:12:12,511 --> 02:12:14,111
Come along.

1008
02:12:52,711 --> 02:12:55,211
Are you alright?
- Keep going.

1009
02:13:32,111 --> 02:13:35,611
Sturmmann Krüger and his group
defended the Wolf Bridge ...

1010
02:13:36,311 --> 02:13:38,811
and he receives the Iron Cross.

1011
02:13:39,411 --> 02:13:43,411
Sturmmann Wagner took out two
machine-gun nests ...

1012
02:13:44,111 --> 02:13:47,111
and therefore, receives
the Iron Cross.

1013
02:13:47,811 --> 02:13:51,311
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten
messages through the lines ...

1014
02:13:51,911 --> 02:13:54,411
and receives the Iron Cross.

1015
02:14:25,711 --> 02:14:27,711
The others are coming.

1016
02:14:34,511 --> 02:14:36,511
Take cover, Müller.

1017
02:14:56,211 --> 02:14:57,211
Who's that?

1018
02:15:04,911 --> 02:15:06,911
A German.

1019
02:15:12,611 --> 02:15:14,011
Herr Hewel?

1020
02:15:17,911 --> 02:15:19,911
Thank God, you're alive.

1021
02:15:22,011 --> 02:15:23,411
Where are the others?

1022
02:15:26,211 --> 02:15:30,211
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere. Maybe.

1023
02:15:30,811 --> 02:15:33,811
Most people from my group
must be dead.

1024
02:15:34,511 --> 02:15:36,911
I should never
have left that bunker.

1025
02:15:37,711 --> 02:15:42,111
I should have shot myself,
but I couldn't.

1026
02:15:44,311 --> 02:15:47,311
Eat something first. There's 
always enough time to die.

1027
02:16:44,911 --> 02:16:47,411
You stay with the women.

1028
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:50,211
Come along.

1029
02:17:02,811 --> 02:17:06,311
The Russians have surrounded us.
- What's going to happen to us?

1030
02:17:06,911 --> 02:17:09,411
Maybe you can get through.
You could try.

1031
02:17:10,111 --> 02:17:11,611
I'm not taking another step.

1032
02:17:12,711 --> 02:17:17,211
Think about it. The Russians
are after us.

1033
02:17:17,911 --> 02:17:22,911
As a woman, you might have 
a chance. Try it.

1034
02:17:24,111 --> 02:17:25,611
Good luck.

1035
02:17:28,311 --> 02:17:32,311
When you walk past the Russians,
don't look them in the eyes.

1036
02:17:33,011 --> 02:17:36,511
Remember that well. All the best.

1037
02:17:45,611 --> 02:17:47,111
The Russians.

1038
02:17:59,811 --> 02:18:02,311
Gerda, let's go.
- You go.

1039
02:18:02,911 --> 02:18:05,911
I'm exhausted.
- Please.

1040
02:18:08,111 --> 02:18:12,111
I have to give it a try.
Don't be angry with me.

1041
02:18:16,511 --> 02:18:18,011
I'll be alright.

1042
02:18:31,211 --> 02:18:32,711
Herr Doktor.

1043
02:18:33,311 --> 02:18:37,811
My comrades want to surrender.
Can I join you?

1044
02:18:38,511 --> 02:18:42,011
The Führer's dead. Do you want
to continue the war on your own?

1045
02:18:42,611 --> 02:18:44,111
I'm obliged by my oath.

1046
02:18:44,711 --> 02:18:49,211
Then you'd better go
to the Brigadeführer.

1047
02:19:18,011 --> 02:19:19,511
The Russians are evacuating the square.
- So?

1048
02:19:20,611 --> 02:19:22,611
No opposition.
No shooting.

1049
02:19:23,211 --> 02:19:25,711
Then they'll be
here within the hour.

1050
02:19:26,311 --> 02:19:28,311
What shall we do?

1051
02:19:28,411 --> 02:19:32,911
We can't surrender.
- What exactly do you mean?

1052
02:19:33,611 --> 02:19:37,111
When the Russians come,
we'll empty our weapons on them.

1053
02:19:37,811 --> 02:19:42,111
The last bullets are for ourselves.
- That's radical.

1054
02:19:42,311 --> 02:19:46,511
Is this prestigious murder 
and suicide our only option?

1055
02:19:47,211 --> 02:19:50,711
We're SS officers.
We can't survive the Führer.

1056
02:19:50,911 --> 02:19:53,811
Who agrees with me?

1057
02:21:41,611 --> 02:21:44,611
Come and sit down with me?
- Please.

1058
02:21:50,511 --> 02:21:55,511
Why do you want to continue living?
- And you? Why do you want to die?

1059
02:21:57,311 --> 02:21:59,311
See this?

1060
02:21:59,911 --> 02:22:02,911
The Führer gave it
to me personally.

1061
02:22:03,611 --> 02:22:07,111
As a last decoration?
- Maybe.

1062
02:22:07,811 --> 02:22:12,311
A goodbye present from Hitler.
I had to promise him something.

1063
02:22:12,411 --> 02:22:17,411
If the Russians get me,
I have to kill myself.

1064
02:22:19,711 --> 02:22:23,711
Did he make you promise that?
But why?

1065
02:22:24,411 --> 02:22:27,411
Maybe he didn't want
me to be forced ...

1066
02:22:28,111 --> 02:22:30,111
to say anything bad
about him.

1067
02:22:30,711 --> 02:22:34,711
But, as a diplomat, you're 
under international protection.

1068
02:22:35,411 --> 02:22:38,911
Who will benefit
if you stick to your deal?

1069
02:22:39,611 --> 02:22:41,111
There they are.

1070
02:22:54,311 --> 02:22:55,811
Don't shoot, comrades.

1071
02:22:59,811 --> 02:23:04,211
We surrendered.
The war is over.

1072
02:23:05,411 --> 02:23:07,411
It's over.

1073
02:24:41,311 --> 02:24:44,311

on 7 May 1945.

1074

02:27:12,511 --> 02:27:14,511
He still lives in Berlin.

1107
02:27:15,011 --> 02:27:17,611
Traudl Junge was classified
as a 'young follower'.

1108
02:27:18,211 --> 02:27:21,211
She worked as a secretary and lived
in Munich, until her death in 2002.

1109
02:27:21,911 --> 02:27:27,611
All the horror I heard about during
the Nuremberg trial ...

1110
02:27:28,011 --> 02:27:33,611
the 6 million Jews, dissidents
or people of another race ...

1111
02:27:34,411 --> 02:27:39,811
who died, shocked me deeply.

1112
02:27:41,111 --> 02:27:45,711
But I hadn't made the connection
with my own past yet.

1113
02:27:47,011 --> 02:27:51,411
I reassured myself by thinking
I wasn't personally guilty of it.

1114
02:27:52,211 --> 02:27:57,211
And that I hadn't known
about the sheer size of it.

1115
02:27:57,811 --> 02:28:03,811
But one day, I walked
past a commemorative plaque ...

1116
02:28:04,711 --> 02:28:08,111
for Sophie Scholl,
here in the Franz-Joseph-Strasse.

1117
02:28:09,311 --> 02:28:11,911
I saw that she was my age ...

1118
02:28:12,411 --> 02:28:18,011
and that she was executed in
the year I joined Hitler.

1119
02:28:18,711 --> 02:28:23,711
And only then did I realise ...

1120
02:28:24,911 --> 02:28:27,511
that youth is no excuse.

1121
02:28:28,011 --> 02:28:34,011
And that it might have been
possible to find out the truth.
