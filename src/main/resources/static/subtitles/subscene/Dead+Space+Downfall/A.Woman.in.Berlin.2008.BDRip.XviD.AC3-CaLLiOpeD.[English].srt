1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,900
Anonyma

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,300
A Woman in Berlin

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,400
Who would've thought that?

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,200
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,800
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,700
and now they were heading
towards the Reichstag.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,100
On this day,
you could see the sun behind the clouds,

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,400
and the smell of lilac
wafted through all the smoke.

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,300
How to start?

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,500
How to find the right words?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I've been a journalist,
I've traveled 12 countries.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,400
Been living in Moscow,
Paris and London.

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,900
I really liked to stay
in Paris and London.

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,300
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.

15
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,700
My name doesn't matter.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I am one of the many who fervently
believed in our country's future.

17
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,900
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,500
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.

19
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,100
The Russians don't have a leader.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
When they finally come to their senses,

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,800
we are already knocking at
their front door in Moscow.

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,100
Pardon our pushiness,
but it's war after all.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Gerd hated railway stations.

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,000
When he left, the sound of
his boots filled the house.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,500
We were certain to do the right thing,

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,700
we breathed the same
air as everybody else.

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,500
We were part of this.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,700
And then he takes off my coat and says:

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,500
The Russians have no idea
what's coming towards them.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,100
So we were heading towards the
Sorbonne and chatting away in French.

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,300
He thought that I was one
of those tall blond Swedes.

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,400
Then I made a double step
to match my stride to his.

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,700
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,200
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Hold on. I... I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,900
I would like for us all
to share this moment,

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
this wonderful evening,
with our husbands

38
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,900
who are stationed
somewhere all over Europe.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,900
Get lost!

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,800
Run, run!

41
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,400
Get away!

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,200
Go away!
Houses on the right. Fan out.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,700
Come here, damn it!

44
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Mummy, where are you?

45
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,300
Come on. Hurry.

46
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,700
Away. Go away.

47
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,800
Open fire, reload grenade.

48
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,900
...and fire!

49
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,900
Fire!

50
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,400
Shit.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,700
- Wait for me.
- Watch out! Heads down.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,900
- There you are.
- Stop! Wait for me.

53
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Watch out!

54
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,500
No!

55
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,100
No uniforms, no weapons,
or it's martial law.

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Felix, where are you?

57
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Felix?

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,900
- Where the hell is he? Felix?
- Not a single order.

59
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,300
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,900
Felix? Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?

61
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,400
In Wedding district, they are already
showing their toddlers to the Russians.

62
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,900
Russian pigs.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,200
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.

64
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,800
And that's the pharmacist's widow.

65
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,900
Her husband once cured Minister
Hindenburg's headache.

66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,100
That's over.

67
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Now you step on the face
and the arms of a dead woman

68
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
only to get a glass of jelly.

69
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,600
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician. Her husband is MIA.

70
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,600
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,900
Look at me. Look at me!

72
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,300
I will write all of this down,
I will report it.

73
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Gerd, and you shall read it.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,800
May I offer you something?

75
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,100
Thank you.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,900
From Silesia.
She won't make it.

77
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,700
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!

78
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,100
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.

79
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,700
They're coming.

80
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Halt!

81
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,100
Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.

82
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,400
All fire arms have to be
turned in immediately.

83
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,800
This is the last warning.

84
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,800
Attention, attention.

85
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,100
This is the last warning.

86
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,600
Attack!

87
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,200
Upstairs!

88
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
All the way upstairs!

89
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,900
Go away! Not now!

90
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Attention!

91
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,800
I... I have...

92
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Careful!

93
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Comrade Colonel.

94
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,300
The troops have almost
reached Potsdam station.

95
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But the order was to go towards
the government district!

96
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,800
Understood,
Comrade Colonel.

97
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
We'll stay here.

98
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,100
Major! I thought we were
going to the Reichstag.

99
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,200
No Reichstag? But why not,
we are so close.

100
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Screw it,
we are not staying here!

101
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
That's an order!

102
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Retreat!
Secure our flank!

103
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,200
Understood?

104
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Soldiers?
Officers?

105
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,600
Weapons?

106
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,200
I said: Soldiers?
Officers?

107
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,900
They will see soon enough.

108
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,200
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.

109
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Get out!
One person at a time.

110
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Get out, all of you!
Move it!

111
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,900
- Russian filth!
- Up!

112
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,000
What... do you want?

113
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Russian?

114
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Yes.

115
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,700
Russian!

116
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Come.

117
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,600
Come.

118
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,200
Eat.

119
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,500
War kaput.

120
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,500
Woman.

121
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,200
Come! Eat.

122
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
War kaput, woman.

123
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Come on.

124
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,500
No fear.

125
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
No fear.

126
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
We will not die here.

127
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
Bravo, come, come.

128
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,600
Don't be afraid.

129
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Come.

130
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,600
Don't shiver!

131
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,000
Good! Come.

132
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.

133
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,600
You be nice and you'll
get something to eat.

134
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,400
Potatoes. Very good.

135
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,800
May I?

136
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,400
Does anybody know
how this thing works?

137
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,400
You, Ukrainian,
do you know it?

138
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,100
There they are,
our Russian liberators.

139
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,200
Full of joy.

140
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,000
It seems they can hardly believe
that they've made it this far.

141
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,800
I know them,
their sandals and villages.

142
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,300
Their rapidly constructed new
buildings they are so proud of.

143
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,000
Stop!

144
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,900
They are without any constraints.

145
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,200
Don't move,
asshole!

146
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
Leave her.

147
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Get lost.

148
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,400
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?

149
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,700
That's enough!

150
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,900
No, seriously...

151
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,300
Your urine is much too old.

152
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,900
Back in Leningrad, I put my general
back on his feet with urine...

153
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,300
You storyteller!

154
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
It's true.

155
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,500
What are they doing?

156
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Please!

157
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,300
Please!

158
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,100
Have you husband?

159
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,400
A husband and two children.

160
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,400
Come anyway.

161
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,900
Quick, quick!
Let me through! Let me through!

162
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,600
No, no, you pigs.

163
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,500
You pigs! No!

164
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,900
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

165
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Stop.

166
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,700
- You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
Come on, don't be so prude.

167
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,900
Most fellow countrymen adeptly
saved their own hides.

168
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,600
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.

169
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Leave!

170
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Mrs. Hitler.

171
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,300
You slut! Where to?

172
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,000
To the Fuhrer?

173
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,200
Here. Quick.
Penthouse to the right. Quick! Go!

174
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,900
Take this and go! Go!

175
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Come.

176
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,700
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.

177
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,300
Soldier!

178
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,400
Why are you taking a woman...

179
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,500
who doesn't want you?

180
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,700
Willing women are unclean.

181
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,600
Open the door! Open it!

182
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,800
Open the door,
you bastards! Open it!

183
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,400
Not here.

184
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,300
- Where?
- Almost there.

185
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,200
Stop! Stay where you are!

186
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,700
Hey you.

187
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,200
Shoo shoo!

188
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,400
Commander...

189
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
I am looking for
the commanding officer.

190
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,300
What's up?

191
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,400
Are you in charge here?

192
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,600
I... we need help.

193
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Are you in charge here?

194
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,900
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.

195
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,700
Which one do you want?

196
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,600
Major, sir...

197
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,900
We need your help...

198
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,100
Our men are all healthy and clean.

199
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Mrs. Hitler.

200
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,300
Our country is finished.

201
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,000
Gerd, do you remember your first words?

202
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,600
"Give me 30 minutes and you will
never want to leave me again. "

203
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
God almighty.

204
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,000
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.

205
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,300
She took me by the hand and just led me
inside her undestroyed apartment.

206
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,300
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.

207
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Moving places was easy: a blouse,
a few books and notebooks.

208
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,400
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.

209
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,000
Take good care of yourself.

210
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
In spite of everything, it would have
been good to have a closer look around.

211
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,100
But then, we never know everything,
so that's how the story continued.

212
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,600
I guess it has been
really nice here once.

213
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,200
How did you find me here?

214
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I searched every cellar.

215
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
How often?

216
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,000
Often.

217
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,500
The shores are clad in green,

218
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,100
the trees are breathing
freely and deeply

219
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,500
We bravely stride on and on,

220
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,000
towards the final assault
in this war!

221
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,800
Our path was long to reach
this day in May.

222
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
It has cost us much
strength and courage.

223
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,900
But now we are free again!

224
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,100
We proudly take our positions.

225
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,500
Greetings, May.

226
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,100
Our soldiers and a few American weapons,
and those would be history.

227
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,600
Yeah.

228
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,500
Yesterday at the water pump,
it was my turn,

229
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,900
a guy approaches me,

230
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,800
two Iron Crosses and one German
Cross in Gold on his chest,

231
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,100
and he gallantly takes the buckets
out of my hands. And I say:

232
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,300
"How do I deserve this honor?"
and he says "We can't give up now"

233
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,800
"because if the Russian
even remotely does to us

234
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,000
"what we did to them
during the last four years,

235
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,500
"in the near future there won't
be any living Germans left. "

236
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,900
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.

237
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,600
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin! We made it!

238
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,600
How do you say: Excuse me,
do you have a dictionary?

239
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,900
I guess he doesn't need a
dictionary for what he wants.

240
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Lenchen!

241
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,100
Come with us!

242
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,700
Come where?

243
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Lenchen!

244
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,000
During the next few days,
our house was raided day and night.

245
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,100
Lenchen!

246
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,900
One woman hanged herself,
another one was shot to death.

247
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,400
None of us was spared.

248
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,600
Every emotion is dead.

249
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Hey, you from Berlin!

250
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,600
Over here! Upstairs.
What kept you so long?

251
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,900
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.

252
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,800
Forever!

253
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,900
Lenchen.

254
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,200
- What have you got there?
- A map.

255
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,900
Move it! Faster.

256
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,800
You go left,
I go right.

257
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,200
Where are you going?
Come to us.

258
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,900
Come.

259
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,200
Wake up, damned of the earth,
who are living in hunger and misery.

260
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,700
Justice is about to burst through
like glowing magma in a volcano.

261
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,000
You just go away, away!

262
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,100
I!

263
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,200
I...

264
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,000
...love...

265
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
...you.

266
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,700
Good day.

267
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
Please, don't!

268
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,900
My pretty one.
I'll be back.

269
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
My pretty one...

270
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,200
I am a young man...

271
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,400
You scared me.

272
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,400
We will survive all this,

273
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,100
by any means necessary.

274
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,100
Where to?

275
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,500
We're here.

276
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,300
Who are you looking for?

277
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,300
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.

278
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,300
So where are they now,
our saviors, all the great armies?

279
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,900
In the past, war and dying
was a male exclusive thing.

280
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But those times are long gone.

281
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,800
Damned Russians. Officer, General,
Commander, doesn't matter.

282
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I take everyone,
as high in rank as possible.

283
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,300
From now on,
I will decide who gets me.

284
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,200
No, no. Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.

285
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,900
You can protect us from over there
on the couch, see? Protect.

286
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,100
Hm? See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.

287
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,600
Do you understand?

288
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,400
Where is the Major?

289
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,100
Wait.

290
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Hey, Miss.

291
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,100
Who are you looking for?

292
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,600
You, blondie.

293
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,000
Why are you looking so stern?

294
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,400
You!

295
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,700
Could you soap my back, huh?

296
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,800
Who do you want to talk to?

297
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
You.

298
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,900
Dismissed.

299
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,700
May I have a seat?

300
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,700
No.

301
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,900
Yesterday our house has been occupied
and many women have been raped.

302
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,800
I know nothing of that.

303
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,900
It is your duty to help us.

304
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Who?

305
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,400
My people...

306
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,300
...or yours?

307
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,500
Me.

308
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,600
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.

309
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,500
It's pointless.

310
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,900
You Russian? Looking what?

311
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,000
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?

312
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,900
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.

313
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,100
Lieutenant, sir.

314
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,600
May I have a word?

315
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Some of the balconies in
our house are mined.

316
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,400
Could you help?

317
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,300
Pity.

318
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,000
Miss!

319
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,800
You, I, evening?

320
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
Hm?

321
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
I Anatol.

322
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,300
You, I, simple as that, huh?

323
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,800
At this moment I made a vow,

324
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,700
that nothing and nobody would
touch me, no matter what happened.

325
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,100
Come in.
Follow.

326
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,000
That's where I live.

327
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,200
Come on in.

328
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,300
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.

329
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,800
Well...

330
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,800
That's my husband.

331
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,200
Don't you understand?

332
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,700
My husband.

333
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,500
You must understand that.

334
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,200
All humans are bad.

335
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,300
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.

336
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
What are doing?
That is mahogany.

337
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,100
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.

338
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,100
To the 215th Rifles!

339
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,300
To victory!

340
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,800
To us.

341
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,100
I Charkov!

342
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,600
He's from Charkov.

343
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,500
Charkov! Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.

344
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,900
An accountant?
You're kidding me.

345
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,100
I accountant! You accountant!
We accountant!

346
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,700
Everything fine.

347
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,200
That's life, you see?

348
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,700
You, pretty.

349
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.

350
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,500
The fucking war is really
pissing me off.

351
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
True.

352
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,800
When I get back to Charkov,

353
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,100
I'll marry, build a house,

354
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,900
get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.

355
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,400
and you, I will
take you as my accountant.

356
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,500
Are you a professional soldier?

357
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,600
No...

358
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
I, dairy.

359
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,300
Milk! Milk. Cow.

360
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,600
- How very interesting.
- Interesting! Milk and milk.

361
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,900
That's bullshit.

362
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,700
Look at this.

363
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,200
My trophies.

364
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,900
That's nothing.

365
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,100
Here.

366
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,200
THAT is a trophy.

367
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,100
That's not a trophy.

368
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
Have a look at this.

369
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,000
That...

370
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,300
...that is a REAL trophy.

371
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,800
An original.

372
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,300
My present to all the ladies.

373
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,300
To kiss and marvel about.

374
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,600
Where toilet?

375
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,000
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.

376
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,100
Would you like something to eat?

377
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,100
You.

378
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,600
You fancy my dick?

379
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,500
Doesn't matter which one.

380
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,100
Dick is dick.

381
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,000
Why Russia?

382
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,000
What were you doing there,
you sons of a bitch?

383
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,800
Why Russia?

384
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,600
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.

385
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,700
He is battalion commander. They don't
have commandants, only commanders.

386
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,300
Did you know that they study
German as first foreign language?

387
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,500
Well, it needs a war for us to
get this bit of information.

388
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,700
Can I do something for you?

389
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,700
Hey Mongol. Have you come
all the way from Moscow

390
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,900
just to get some water
for a German woman?

391
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,400
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?

392
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,400
Made in Germany...

393
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,400
I am taking care of the Major.

394
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,300
Go now.
I'll catch up later.

395
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,200
Go.

396
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,200
Go, Mongol, go!

397
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,600
Move it. Faster!
Go, go, go!

398
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,800
Move it already.
Faster.

399
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,600
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors
and the whole house was rubble.

400
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,400
And it blasted the fattened
sow up till under the roof.

401
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,100
Well, obviously it was spoiled.

402
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,200
Here.

403
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,000
Give it to me.

404
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,300
My apologies...

405
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,900
for my unsuitable behavior.

406
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,600
Dismissed.

407
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,600
Berlin is ours.

408
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,600
There.

409
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,200
I have told everybody
that they needed to go.

410
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,900
May I sit down?

411
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,400
Come here.

412
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,800
As you wish.

413
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,200
No?

414
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,800
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.

415
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,400
In every apartment.

416
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,800
We are Russian property now.
At their service.

417
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,000
But us women, we will need to
keep our mouths shut,

418
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,500
or no man will ever want to touch
us again when this is all over.

419
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,800
Poor Germany.

420
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,100
German fighters: sit!

421
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,200
Four. Four women.

422
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,200
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.

423
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,000
Here.
That's what I've found.

424
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,900
They've got everything.

425
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,100
They've got jewelry
and money and houses.

426
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,800
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.

427
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,300
Enough.

428
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,400
What do I care about them?

429
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,400
Sometimes I think that from now on
I could endure everything imaginable,

430
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,100
as long as it comes from the outside

431
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,400
and not from deep within
my treacherous heart.

432
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:11,400
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.

433
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,200
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.

434
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,500
A welcome committee.

435
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,800
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.

436
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,200
Anatol is a gypsy.

437
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,900
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.

438
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,800
My sun.

439
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,600
Do you think...

440
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,500
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?

441
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,100
No. Never.

442
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,100
Here.

443
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,800
Is that all?

444
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,900
My head is aching like crazy.

445
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,600
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.

446
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,000
If that's the last thing
I'll do in my life.

447
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,700
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.

448
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,200
Fuck the Reichstag.

449
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,200
Then he grabs me
and throws me on the bed.

450
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,000
And suddenly, he gets so boring,
like a lapdog.

451
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,500
Later, he complimented me.

452
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:50,600
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this. "

453
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,800
"You, like this. "

454
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,600
He had really bad breath.

455
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,500
- Oh. It's you.
- Good morning. We bring breakfast.

456
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,500
The next morning, a few blocks
away the war was still raging,

457
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,700
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.

458
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:37,200
The widow, who loved bacon,
was busy as a bee.

459
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,400
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard,
was all too happy to surrender.

460
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
This way.

461
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,600
- Russian horse.
- What's that?

462
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,900
Sugar. We have sugar!

463
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,300
And bacon and salami
and bread and butter.

464
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,600
Great joy,
but not for everybody.

465
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,400
Then came the cavalry.

466
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,300
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead,
horses snuffling.

467
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,600
When a horse is charging,

468
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,400
that's an incredible force.

469
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,600
The whole avalanche is
charging against the tank,

470
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,200
against the artillery,
against all the machine guns -

471
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,600
All kaput.

472
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,600
You've had much more troops,

473
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,400
but they just couldn't stand it.

474
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,800
They dropped their weapons and fled.

475
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,900
German soldiers, bah!

476
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,400
Don't be so insensitive.

477
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,500
We didn't start this war!

478
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,100
Sit down.

479
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,800
And stop insulting our host.

480
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,500
Enough.

481
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,800
I Caucasus.

482
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,700
Caucasus, understand?

483
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,600
Big mountain, so beautiful!

484
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,000
Sun, blue sky.

485
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,700
Nice dancing with women.

486
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,000
As sweet as grapes.

487
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,600
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.

488
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,200
Pushkin? Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.

489
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,800
Go home, understand?

490
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,800
I want to see my children
and my wife.

491
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,800
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin. "

492
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,500
I want my wife.

493
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,600
My wife. Understand?

494
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,200
What do you know about fascism?

495
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,800
Fascism?

496
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,100
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a
"bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.

497
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,800
To our host.

498
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,800
Right.

499
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,200
To a woman who is
quite obviously very bright.

500
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,100
Just like you right now.
Very bright.

501
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,500
But I am not a woman!

502
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,800
To German-Russian friendship!

503
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,600
Hurray!

504
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,700
Everybody upstairs, quick!

505
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,600
Hurry! Quick!

506
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,300
Search all the apartments.

507
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,400
Out. Out!

508
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,800
You goddamn bastard!
You dick! You fucking dick!

509
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,900
Stop it.

510
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,100
Enough!

511
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,700
You know Stalin's orders.

512
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,100
Get lost.

513
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,000
Really? What if I don't?

514
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,200
Are you gonna shoot me?

515
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,100
I'll kill you if I have to.

516
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,200
He is acting on my orders.

517
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,500
Stop!

518
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,300
A young soldier has stolen food.

519
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,200
He is armed.

520
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,600
Who is living up there?

521
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,900
Who is living there?

522
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,200
Anybody living there?

523
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,900
No.

524
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,500
She's lying.

525
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,500
Lying bitch.

526
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,900
I spit on Germany.

527
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,700
And on Berlin.

528
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,200
We conquered it,
and I spit on it!

529
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,800
Get out of my way.

530
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,000
Don't move.

531
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,400
I'll kill you, punk!

532
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:09,900
Everyone in possession of fire
arms or hiding someone with guns

533
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,500
will be executed immediately,
their houses destroyed.

534
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,900
They will not forget this.

535
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,800
Can I have something to drink?

536
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,400
You need to get away from here.

537
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,500
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.

538
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,300
During the next few days,
the Major was here often.

539
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,400
Great protection for everyone.

540
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,000
In his coat he had tucked away candles
and cigars and plenty of gifts

541
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:16,700
that the widow stashed away in her
kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.

542
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,900
On the whole,
the times were changing.

543
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,700
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?

544
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,400
That is way too much.

545
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:45,100
The major speaks sophisticated Russian
and told me more than I wanted to know.

546
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,800
Now I know about his bank account,

547
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,700
his parents and the
names of his brothers.

548
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:55,700
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.

549
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:01,500
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.

550
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,000
The war continued.

551
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,800
While our men and husbands
were sent to Siberia,

552
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,600
many of the women found protectors

553
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,800
which made them a taboo
for the rest of the pack.

554
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,900
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.

555
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,500
Almost there.
Hold it up. Up.

556
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,000
In and out, in and out.

557
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,500
It's like Grand Central Station in here.

558
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,200
Mussolini is dead. Hanged.

559
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,900
He deserved it.
One asshole less.

560
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,800
Cheers!

561
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:04,300
As soon as Andrej had left the house,
Anatol claimed his visiting rights.

562
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:10,400
I was afraid that the two top dogs
would meet and kill me one day.

563
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,500
It's not that I could claim
that this Major is raping me.

564
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,600
I am at his service.

565
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,700
A whore? Maybe.

566
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,600
I have met that kind of
woman only once in my life.

567
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,900
People told me not to talk to
her because she was unsound.

568
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,200
Whatever that means: unsound.

569
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,900
Young woman!

570
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,500
No way.

571
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Incredible.

572
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,000
There she comes prancing
along as if nothing happened.

573
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,400
- How often?
- Four times. You?

574
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,500
Come on.

575
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,700
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.

576
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,900
So do you.

577
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,700
Here. Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux. Take it.

578
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,100
You take that with you.

579
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,100
Seems you are having
a good life here.

580
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,700
That's one way to put it.
Come on.

581
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,000
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

582
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,700
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.

583
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,900
The Major is guarding us well

584
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,400
so that we can drink his tea
without any disturbances.

585
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,700
That feels so good.

586
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,300
Where to?

587
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,500
What do you care?

588
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,100
You can't go in there.

589
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,000
Who's in there?

590
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,500
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.

591
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,300
So I tell him:"Young man,

592
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:08,000
"that gun there over your shoulder,
that might go off. "

593
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,100
And when I go up the stairs,

594
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:16,200
on the second floor someone
rushes out of the apartment,

595
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,200
grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"

596
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,200
And I am in shock and I say:

597
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,900
- "No, surely not. "
- How dumb of you.

598
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,000
How's your husband?

599
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,800
He was there when it
happened the first time.

600
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,000
He's been a bit confused ever since.

601
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:39,100
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.

602
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,700
They are pretty unimaginative.

603
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,300
It may be that at home,

604
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,300
they have the latest and greatest
socialist planned economy,

605
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,600
...but their sex life
is that of Adam and Eve.

606
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,000
That's what I told my husband, too.

607
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:59,100
With all the food shortage,
a good husband isn't worth that much.

608
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:04,400
I guess a satisfactory sex
life depends on regular meals.

609
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:08,000
For me, it's all
about a full stomach.

610
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,700
No gifts, no sex!

611
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,400
Heart, Pain, Love,
Sex Drive. To us!

612
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,900
Who knows when we'll be
together again.

613
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,700
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!

614
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,800
That is apple streusel cake.

615
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,800
Yeah, with crumbles,
and it's still steaming hot.

616
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,300
# You, you are in my heart. #

617
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,000
# You, you are on my mind. #

618
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,600
# You, you cause me great pains, #

619
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:45,100
# you don't know how much I love you. #

620
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:52,000
# don't know how much I love you. #

622
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,100
Not too much going on with our
Russian men right now, am I right?

623
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:05,500
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.

624
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,500
Have you heard anything from Gerd?

625
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,900
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.

626
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:15,900
Oh my God.

627
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,300
How do you know you've got it?

628
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,000
Itching and burning.

629
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,100
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.

630
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,500
I've read it in a lexicon.

631
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,200
A lexicon...

632
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,700
Here.

633
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,700
An American gave that to me.

634
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,800
Chew it.

635
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,900
Good, isn't it?

636
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,200
Americans...

637
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,100
They all look like film stars.

638
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,800
I'm leaving.

639
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,600
And tell her...

640
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,600
that I'll be back.

641
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,500
You got that?

642
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,800
What's that?

643
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,900
Can you protect us?

644
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,900
Just this one day?

645
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,800
I'll be here.

646
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,000
Where will you go...
later?

647
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,300
To where I am needed.

648
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,300
A special evening with the Major.

649
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,800
Good conversation.

650
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,800
He told me that he adores me.

651
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,100
And that he doesn't care
about anything else.

652
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,100
Other than the Germans, the Russian
men really appreciate educated women.

653
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,600
But the war hasn't ended yet.

654
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,100
Excuse me.

655
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:59,700
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.

656
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,500
Come on, kiddos,
let's get out of here.

657
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,800
We will finish building
this tower of yours.

658
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,900
That's him.

659
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,400
Good day.

660
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,100
You Russian?

661
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,300
Translate.

662
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,800
The German army came to my village

663
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,600
and killed all the children.

664
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,000
They have...

665
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,700
...stabbed them to death,

666
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,100
took their bodies at the ankles...

667
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,500
Continue!

668
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,600
...and smashed their skulls...

669
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,600
...on the walls...

670
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,500
...of the houses.

671
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,500
Have you heard that?

672
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,100
Or did you see it with your own eyes?

673
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,900
I saw it.

674
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,500
Hey! Why so fast?

675
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,400
Have you forgotten your panties?

676
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,900
You speak Russian,
so tell him he needs to stop that.

677
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,900
You speak Russian, right?

678
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,200
Move it, you slut!
Go.

679
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,100
Where are you going?

680
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,700
I've been waiting for you.

681
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,400
What's wrong with you?

682
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,600
Comrade Major!

683
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,500
The old Germany is coming to an end.

684
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,200
Stay away from him!

685
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,400
He is coming to me,

686
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,300
not the other way round.

687
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,000
Go away.

688
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,300
Why?

689
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,900
You Germans have hanged his wife.

690
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:32,400
Attention! On April 30th,
1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.

691
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:39,500
He deserted all of us who have
pledged allegiance to him.

692
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,900
Following the orders of the Fuhrer,
you still believe it's your duty

693
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,700
to defend Berlin although
the supply of heavy armory,

694
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,600
ammunition and your position make
this fight utterly pointless.

695
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,100
With every hour you continue to fight,

696
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:04,500
you prolong the horrible suffering
of the civil population of Berlin...

697
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,500
and our wounded soldiers.

698
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,900
From now on, everybody who
dies in the battle for Berlin

699
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,900
will have sacrificed
their lives in vain.

700
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,600
In accordance with the leaders
of the Soviet army I prompt you

701
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,000
to cease all fighting immediately.

702
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:33,000
Breitling, Artillery General and
commanding officer of the Berlin defense.

703
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:49,500
Fellow soldiers and officers
of the 8th guard army.

704
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,400
This morning,

705
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,400
the Berlin garrison...

706
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,000
...has capitulated.

707
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,900
Berlin...

708
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,100
is defeated.

709
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,700
I've told you we would make it!

710
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,700
I'll join my fellow Germans.

711
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,400
Go to Siberia?

712
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
What about us?

713
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,300
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!

714
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,100
Talk to me.

715
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,500
I've been waiting for you.

716
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,400
I have prayed and hoped,

717
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,900
prayed and hoped.

718
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,900
No I want you to fulfill

719
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,400
some of those hopes for me.

720
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!

721
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,300
Berlin is defeated!

722
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,700
To our home country!

723
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,400
Long live the Red Army!

724
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:43,500
Long live Stalin!

725
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Hold on, wait a second.

726
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,000
What have we here?
Two halibuts.

727
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:28,900
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.

728
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,500
That's great!
Let's drink.

729
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,900
Capitulation.

730
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,100
The time has come.

731
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,200
The war is over.

732
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:46,500
Us women have been looking
forward to this day so much.

733
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:46,800
So how does it feel?

734
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,900
Bitter, bitter defeat.

735
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:57,300
More and more people report
gruesome things.

736
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,600
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp
something in the air,

737
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,500
mean and threatening.

738
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,700
I don't want to think
about that right now.

739
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,900
It's over.

740
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,900
I don't know...

741
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:28,200
I'm afraid misfortune has still
some tricks up its sleeves.

742
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,200
Do you hear that?

743
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,500
They drink and smoke like men.

744
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,100
There are 1 million women
in the Russian army.

745
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:01,900
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.

746
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:07,200
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.

747
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:13,000
Once a woman came to me,
Ljuba was her name I think.

748
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,900
She says: "Comrade Major,
I believe I will fall today.

749
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:23,500
"I want new clothes. " I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.

750
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:28,200
"Bullets just avoid you. "
Two hours later, she comes again.

751
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,400
And again. Then I tell her:

752
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:38,100
"Then the new shirt,
with ties white as snow,

753
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:42,200
it would be spoiled by the blood. "

754
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:48,600
All female soldiers fear that when
they die, they don't look pretty.

755
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,100
Are you a fascist?

756
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,500
What are you looking for?

757
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,500
All occupied.

758
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,600
And the battalion commander?

759
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,600
That's what I like
about you Mongols.

760
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,900
Not a single unnecessary word.

761
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,200
1678 days...

762
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:47,100
since I've been in this war.

763
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,300
And now...

764
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,300
And she...

765
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,600
she's a whore.

766
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,500
Am I right?

767
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,400
This whole place...

768
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,200
is a brothel!

769
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,200
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.

770
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,100
A pistol, huh? Bastard!

771
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,400
Peace, huh?

772
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,800
Don't!

773
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,000
War kaput!

774
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:30,100
I said, move it!

775
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:31,900
Everybody downstairs.

776
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,500
Hurry!

777
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,700
All of you, downstairs.

778
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,600
Hurry!

779
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,300
Faster.

780
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,100
Quick!

781
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,200
Don't move.

782
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,700
Where you get weapons?

783
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,400
Whose apartment is that?

784
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,800
Who?

785
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,300
It's mine.

786
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,200
Is that hers?

787
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,300
It's hers.

788
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:33,000
That is crime against
decree of Red Army.

789
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:36,200
Long live the Fuhrer.

790
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,700
Eliminate her.

791
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:42,300
You can all go to hell.

792
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,700
Did you know about weapons?

793
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:55,200
- No.
- Go back to apartment.

794
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,000
Shoot them all!

795
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:58,400
Go now.

796
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,600
Stop.

797
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,300
They're liars, all of them!

798
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,500
Shoot them.

799
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,300
Leave this woman.

800
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:08,800
She is a Hitler broad.

801
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,800
Do you understand?

802
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:11,200
No.

803
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,600
First she will be interrogated.

804
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,600
Do you understand?

805
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,100
What are you doing, brother?

806
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,000
This woman has sheltered
an armed soldier.

807
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:24,600
The punishment for that is death.

808
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,900
Go, now!

809
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,800
I'll have to report this.

810
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,500
Burn them alive!

811
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:52,300
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.

812
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,500
Traitor!

813
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,300
I own whole Berlin! Hotel Adlon,
Wedding, Kaiserdamm!

814
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,800
Red flags everywhere.

815
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:49,400
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.

816
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,300
What is it?

817
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,300
Quarrel?

818
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,500
What are you looking at?

819
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,900
Get out of my sight.

820
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:20,500
Hey, what's up?

821
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:22,500
To victory, Commander.

822
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:25,000
To Stalin and our victory.

823
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:27,000
Wait.
You should stay with your people.

824
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,300
The war is over.

825
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,400
Here! I get it.

826
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,700
Look...

827
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,800
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.

828
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:41,700
They love me,

829
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,100
all of them.

830
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,400
Everything all right?

831
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Do you want something to eat?

832
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:10,500
Here. What's better? You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?

833
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:13,900
And you, get out of here...

834
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,800
before I shoot your nuts off!

835
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,100
You, listen!

836
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,800
We celebrate.

837
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,100
Everybody come, whole house.

838
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,000
Order!

839
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:30,300
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.

840
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,900
Not human.

841
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:35,800
Turd!

842
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:39,700
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!

843
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,900
Everyone, come now.

844
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Order!

845
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,300
Fill the glasses.

846
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,200
What are you standing there?

847
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,000
We've got guests.

848
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,300
Why fear?

849
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:19,300
Look down there.
What do you see?

850
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,300
Soldiers.

851
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,500
Russians! Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.

852
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:31,800
And you're right.

853
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:38,100
None of us is hesitating a single
second if we can shoot a German.

854
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,800
Your blood is on our uniforms.

855
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:46,300
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!

856
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,600
Most of them didn't even
know what that is, Germany.

857
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,400
Now come with me.

858
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:05,100
What is happening here?

859
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,300
Careful, that's mahogany.

860
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,700
Let me go!

861
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:18,700
- You dance. Dance!
- How dare you?

862
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,200
This is my living room
and not a dance hall.

863
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,400
You understand?

864
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:26,500
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!

865
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,500
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.

866
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,200
You.

867
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:47,200
Sing? Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.

868
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,100
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.

869
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,700
No.

870
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:55,500
What does that mean, "no"?

871
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:00,800
That is Europe!
That is Europe!

872
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,000
Drink, drink.

873
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:06,100
Why not?

874
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,300
I'm looking at you.

875
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,400
And you?
Nothing.

876
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,500
Well, maybe next time.

877
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,600
To you.

878
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,400
I Anatol.

879
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,000
- I know.
- Brbel.

880
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:48,800
My heart calls Brbel.

881
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,300
Brbel, Brbel, Brbel.

882
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,900
I play the fiddle.

883
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:10,200
Violin. Violin?

884
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,600
You play the piano?

885
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:14,900
In an orchestra,
but not any more.

886
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,300
The violin is lost.

887
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:19,800
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.

888
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:29,200
Why don't you go upstairs?

889
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,400
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.

890
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:40,600
We all need that.

891
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,000
Do you come with me?

892
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,500
Later.

893
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,000
- Sure?
- Yes.

894
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,300
It's good that you are here.

895
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,300
I want to embrace you

896
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,100
my whole life.

897
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,000
I am here, you're in Moscow.

898
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:34,100
Nobody has arms that long.

899
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:36,800
Try it.

900
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,000
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.

901
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:53,300
"The war is over. "
He looked at me for a long while.

902
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:58,700
"Every newborn child
cries for war," he said.

903
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,100
Nothing and nobody, no man,
no nation, will stop this vicious circle.

904
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:07,300
Only death.

905
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:18,600
Not so fast,
I am getting sick.

906
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,400
Gee.

907
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,900
Attention.

908
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,500
And now for everybody...

909
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,200
"I in love with you. "

910
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,800
Brbel.

911
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,700
Dance.

912
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,400
Come on, let's go.

913
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:35,000
We are not a people any more,
we're only "the population".

914
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,900
I am talking about individuals
that form within a democracy.

915
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:43,200
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.

916
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:13,100
Dance, dance, you come.

917
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,800
I think we should look at
the greater picture here.

918
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,400
The countries of Europe
will burst their borders.

919
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,600
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will,

920
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:30,800
just like Napoleon did,
re-order the political world map.

921
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:35,500
So we will become a Soviet republic
with planned economy, huh?

922
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:49,700
Thanks.

923
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,300
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.

924
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:00,400
Let's start the every day life again,
and we will soon get into the groove.

925
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,200
Slow down.

926
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,500
Drink.

927
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,000
The Soviet Union is just at
the beginning of its evolution.

928
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,000
The future will prove that.

929
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:53,500
You love your country.

930
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,700
Just as I love mine.

931
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:08,200
My mother once said that one day,

932
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,700
I would marry a man
who played the piano.

933
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:24,800
Everybody has been wondering
what this day would be like.

934
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:29,500
I haven't.

935
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,900
Never.

936
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:44,600
I didn't want to experience it.

937
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,600
Why not?

938
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:13,400
If you don't do it, Andrej,
I will tell you something.

939
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:23,400
War is changing the words.

940
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:33,400
"Love" is not what it used to be.

941
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,300
And yet,

942
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:48,600
in spite of that,

943
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,400
I want that my husband finds the
same wife that he left behind

944
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:57,000
when he returns.

945
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,600
Please stay.

946
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:30,200
Us women,
we are branded for life.

947
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:36,100
But for here and now,
right in this moment,

948
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:40,600
I feel fantastic.

949
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,900
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.

950
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,600
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?

951
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:43,100
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.

952
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,400
And mummy?

953
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Ilse?

954
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Ilse?

955
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:00,900
Ilse?

956
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,700
Ilse.

957
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:23,700
Ilse, get away from him.

958
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,300
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.

959
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:44,900
We went to see Felix.

960
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:48,100
You could smell the tree resin.

961
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:52,900
We came across a cloud of butterflies.

962
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:58,100
And you knew all their names.

963
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:04,900
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds,
Swallowtails and many more.

964
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:12,800
One was taking a sunbath
right there on the path,

965
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,100
it was velvety brown and
yellow with a blue hem.

966
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:18,700
You called it a Mourning Cloak.

967
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:51,200
So many things I've
been given in my life.

968
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:52,400
In abundance.

969
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:55,500
The Major had lost everything.

970
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:58,700
Damn Russian idealist.

971
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,900
He takes it all like he
wants the world to be.

972
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:06,000
Soviet apostle.

973
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,400
I like him though.

974
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:14,200
The less he wants from me,
the more I like him.

975
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:17,200
Very much.

976
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:26,700
Andrej.

977
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:30,300
Andrej.

978
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:04,300
Andrej isn't here any more.

979
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,700
Relocated.

980
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,600
To where?

981
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,000
Unknown.

982
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:25,900
Good-bye.

983
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:32,000
"The birds so quiet,
the bells are silent. "

984
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:38,700
Isn't that how it goes?

985
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,000
Please, sit down.

986
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:26,500
The studio,

987
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:30,500
is that gone?

988
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:46,900
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.

989
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,500
Ukrainians like that.

990
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:49,500
Here, that's for you.

991
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:59,100
You are shameless.

992
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:02,100
Don't you see that?

993
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:09,400
It is disgusting
just to look at you.

994
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,400
Atten-shun!

995
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:49,200
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?

996
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:55,700
That I had the chance
to get to know you.

997
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:08,200
Take care of yourself.

998
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:27,600
How are we supposed to live?

999
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,500
Eyes front!

1000
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:22,000
"Relocation," that's what they call it.

1001
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:26,800
With full honors and merits.

1002
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:30,600
To Siberia, who knows?

1003
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,200
Gerd.

1004
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:58,200
My beloved Gerd.

1005
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,000
What shall we do?

1006
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,700
Turn back the wheel of time?

1007
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:07,900
Back to your very first words?

1008
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,300
"30 minutes", you said.

1009
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:22,200
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will
never want to leave me again. "

1010
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,200
What?

1011
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,100
What?

1012
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:26,700
No answer.

1013
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:30,500
Two days later he was gone.

1014
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:34,000
I don't know if he will come back.

1015
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:37,600
I am surprised that I am
not suffering more.

1016
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:38,700
Maybe I am just too busy.

1017
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:43,300
I need to find a piece of flint stone,

1018
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,600
I need to mop up the
floor of the apartment

1019
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:49,500
and I am desperately
looking for some flowers.

1020
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:52,600
Yesterday I found some lilac.

1021
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,800
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.

1022
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:59,100
Who knows?

1023
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:01,700
Maybe our hearts have
a say in this, too,

1024
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,300
and we'll see each other again,
some day.

1025
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:12,800
When the diary "A woman in Berlin"
was first released in Germany in 1959,

1026
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,500
it was a huge scandal.

1027
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:18,800
Many people said that it was a disgrace
and an insult to the German women.

1028
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:22,900
The author was so shocked by the rejection
and the contempt that her book received.

1029
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:27,100
She prohibited any further
releases for as long as she lived.

1030
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:30,300
And even beyond her death,
here real name was never to be revealed.
