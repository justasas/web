1
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,843
That's her!

2
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,738
Myon?

3
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,854
Myon!

4
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,871
Very impressive!

00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,276
<i>"Send message"</i>

6
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,290
Hello?

You live around here?!

10
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,802
Right under your nose, huh?

11
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,843
Um, wanna ride?

12
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,220
C'mon.

13
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,116
You wish!

14
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,849
You've got it all wrong!

15
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,254
Oh, sure.

16
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:52,763
I live with my sister, my dad lives with
a younger woman!

17
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,231
It's a joke.

18
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:58,236
Mom left one night when we bailed out.

19
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:05,007
Sorry I haven't kept in touch.
My life's kind of a mess, well, still is!

20
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:09,515
Don't worry!
Nice to see you're still the same... size!

21
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,277
Haven't they gotten bigger?

22
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,249
My breasts?

23
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,412
Huh, no, your feet! Let's find you a drugstore!

24
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,817
Better yet, a love hotel.

25
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,913
Hey!

26
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,360
Don't move!

27
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:28,792
Thanks!

28
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,095
Ouch!

29
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,265
What're you doing?

30
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,544
Nishi!

31
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,547
Um!

32
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,020
Would you be sad
if I went out with someone else?

33
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,519
If I married him?

34
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,790
Married!

35
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,500
In junior high, I wrote her a note,
just, "I like you a lot. "

36
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,503
Next day, her turn, "Me too. "

37
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,632
Knocked me off my feet!

38
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,109
We were just 11,
never even held hands after school.

39
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:16,740
Being shy made things awkward right after!

40
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,978
And we could only exchange letters!

41
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:23,056
2 years later, during a school trip!

42
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,522
Would you be sad
if I went out with someone else?

43
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:30,291
<i>"Hotel Tariff"</i>

44
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:41,339
Made me think! I never had the guts
to make a move, always playing it safe.

45
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,500
Always waiting for someone
to help things develop!

46
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,543
Nishi, what do you want?

47
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:55,144
You don't fight, you don't get hurt,
you want me to do all the work.

48
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,850
But that's unfair. 'Cos I'm scared too!

49
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,951
We're not school kids anymore, y'know?

50
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,430
What?

51
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,699
I...

52
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:21,878
I still love you. Don't marry that guy!
I've loved you for 11 years!

53
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:27,714
You should marry me!

54
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,124
I'm...

55
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,052
I'm really happy!

56
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,432
But I love him too.

57
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,907
But I'm so happy now!

58
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:54,072
Myon, I'm not sure I get it,
but give me some time!

59
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,581
Give me a chance, please.

60
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,912
OK, Nishi! Give it your best shot!

61
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,648
You bet!

62
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,687
Nishi?

63
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,157
Nishi? Nishi!

64
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,961
Think I'm too young to marry?

65
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,930
Yeah.

66
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,303
So, you'll be off limits to future suitors!

67
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:26,175
Some are crying themselves to sleep right now.

68
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,773
Well I hope you'll be really happy.

69
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:35,516
Too bad! You don't like me
like you used to!

70
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,884
What are you talking about?
I love you forever!

71
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,257
You haven't changed.

72
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,797
You can be sure about that!

73
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,423
You want to eat yakitori?

74
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,028
Sure!

75
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,036
My sister and I have our own place!

76
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,002
Really?

77
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,733
Gotta make a living!

78
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,405
We've given up on the loans.

79
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,479
I'm gonna run forever!

80
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,346
Cool!

81
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,985
- Hi. Hey, Nishi!
- Hi!

82
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:22,428
Nishi! What a surprise! Come sit over here!

83
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,128
Thanks!

84
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,666
Long time no see!

85
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:31,005
Yang, today's special, and a beer.

86
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,007
Have a drink first!

87
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,010
What've you been up to?
Working on your manga?

88
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,554
Yes! Got a job on the side.

89
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:47,957
You're going to Tokyo, right? Tokyo's great!

90
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:54,666
Lots of good looking women trying to make it
in TV and modeling.

91
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:59,364
When I got married,
I often went there on business!

92
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:06,810
I'd get invited to hostess bars where there'd
be a bunch of girls like that.

93
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:12,215
And I'd pick one out and... Yum yum!

94
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:16,221
Students promoting stuff on the streets,
game show assistants!

95
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,053
- Sir!
- They sure were hot!

96
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,357
- You cheated?
- I was having fun, but they'd fall for me!

97
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:29,834
I had quite a rep, 5 girls in Tokyo,
3 in Osaka, those were the days!

98
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,666
- Don't listen to him!
- Sorry about this.

99
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,765
Meanwhile, these two popped out...

100
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,812
- You don't sound too thrilled!
- Had to take care of them!

101
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,576
So that was it!

102
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:50,753
Y'know, if I'd gotten together with
that promo-girl...

103
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,885
I wouldn't be broke now.

104
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,758
Stop dreaming!

105
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,291
That's him.

106
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,129
Yep, dad hasn't changed at all!

107
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,727
His girlfriend's the same age as me!

108
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,204
Picked her up at a loanshark's office!

109
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,673
Riko? She's not quite on par with
the others though!

110
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,907
So you just forgot about her?

111
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,745
What a waste! Like keeping roses in the can!

112
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:24,813
- What?!
- Your wife! You didn't deserve her!

113
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,949
Why are you taking her side?

114
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,790
'Cause I love the women of the Uchida family!

115
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:35,824
You were surrounded by
3 of the most beautiful women!

116
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:40,372
I even planned a trip
to your home town last year!

117
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,033
Thinking the place'll be
swarming with girls like them!

118
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,043
Had to see the source!

119
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:54,814
Myon, maybe you should marry Nishi.
You'd be happier that way.

120
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,388
What're you talking about?

121
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,119
You love him. You wrote about him
all the time when you were in school!

122
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:06,631
- Wrote what?!
- Oh, Nishi this, Nishi that, Nishi, Nishi!

123
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:07,791
Dad!

124
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:12,395
Ryo's nice too! But I prefer Nishi!

125
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:15,732
Hi!

126
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,501
Hi!

127
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,406
Ryo.

128
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,340
Sir?

129
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,376
Don't mind him!

130
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,246
This is Nishi.

131
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,384
This is Ryo!

132
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:32,686
Hi, heard a lot about you! Pleased to meet you!

133
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,759
Same here.

134
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,986
Beer?

135
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:35,857
Yes!

136
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,656
Did you hear about Kenta's accident?

137
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:39,789
Yeah.

138
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,491
So please be careful.

139
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,226
Here Nishi!

140
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,438
Thanks!

141
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,939
You create manga, right?

142
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,912
Nishi promised to do one about me!

143
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,572
Yes, something naughty and sexy!

144
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,873
Can't wait!

145
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,143
Stop it!

146
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,684
Something nasty and kinky!

147
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,879
I wanna see that!

148
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:07,689
<i>Good looking guy, great bod',
seems trustworthy...</i>

149
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,354
<i>But wasn't something a little...</i>

150
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,125
<i>Odd when you came in?</i>

151
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:18,995
<i>We were talking about ME,
'bout how I'm the one for Myon.</i>

152
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:25,411
<i>You're in the way, pal, a third wheel,
can't you see it?</i>

153
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:35,244
I shouldn't embarrass her by competing
with him. Don't want them to feel awkward.

154
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,718
I'll get my truck on the 25th!

155
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,656
Congratulations.

156
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,923
Carries a 5 ton load! I'll be making money!

157
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:48,964
- You're a truck driver?
- Thanks.

158
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:53,600
I used to do things like that! Hard stuff!

159
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,833
Had no idea, Nishi.

160
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,536
Well, my body's all I've got going for me!

161
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,443
<i>A real man alright!</i>

162
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:08,514
<i>Sensitive can mean neurotic. Women are
happier with these rough and simple types!</i>

163
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,416
<i>Nice smile too! I'm history. She's yours!</i>

164
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,335
Hello!

165
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:42,646
Here!

166
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:45,689
It'll dry soon!

167
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,534
Something wrong?

168
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,569
Your beer!

169
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,043
Hey!

170
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,142
- You know this guy?
- The owner!

171
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:49,511
He's off today! I'm only here part-time!
I'm not sure where he is. Sorry.

172
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,587
OK!

173
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:05,261
Settle down Atsu! We're gonna wait for him!

174
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,935
Right here!

175
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:13,970
I think he said he was taking
a couple of days off somewhere!

176
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:24,948
I knew it, off to a holiday resort!

177
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:31,221
With MY World Cup tickets, having fun.

178
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,335
Stop it! I'll call the police!

179
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,278
Say, you're kinda cute.

180
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,312
What the fuck are you doing, you scum?

181
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,331
And who do you think you are?

182
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,469
Stop it!

183
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,000
Ryo!

184
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,308
Stop it!

185
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:27,645
Atsu, that's enough, put that piece away!

186
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,250
I said put it away!

187
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,030
- What?!
- You don't know what's going on, bro'!

188
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,833
I do.

189
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:54,607
No, you don't! My little Riko,
that old fuck, he...

190
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,148
He coerced her!

191
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:04,654
I know Atsu, but you don't mix business
with private stuff! We're professionals.

192
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:12,460
Y'know, I've been meaning to tell
you: you've got no taste.

193
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:22,403
Teen car, fag watch, just plain bad taste.

194
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:28,413
Me, I'm different, I'm a player!
Not a business man but an artist!

195
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,414
Personal stuff IS my business!

196
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:35,044
Watch your mouth! You don't even know
the meaning of the word artist!

197
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,717
Oh! Atsu, sorry man,
didn't know you felt that way.

198
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,194
Do whatever you want!

199
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:48,358
I'm cool, it's just,
I get mad when I think about that guy!

200
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,694
Raping my Riko, keeping her locked in!

201
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:57,270
Yeah, well if you put it that way,
it's your call!

202
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,741
Say Atsu, can I add something?

203
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,047
NO!

204
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:23,928
Too bad he's out! He'd understand how I feel,
my hurt, my grief!

205
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:28,666
If he sees ME raping HIS girlfriend right here!

206
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,905
I don't know this guy,
first time he came in here.

207
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,508
Well it's true!

208
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,584
Bro, this bitch is lying!

209
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,284
You cunt!

210
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:48,391
They give it up so quickly!

211
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,455
All of 'em!

212
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,895
Wow, great boobs!

213
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:04,166
Don't move!

214
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,478
That's right, like that!

215
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,550
Shut the fuck up!

216
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:21,250
Say, those are sexy undies!

217
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,326
Kinda sparse down there, don't move,
show it to me!

218
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,361
Nishi, are you there?

219
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,870
Nishi?

220
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:43,147
Is he here? Where is he, this way?

221
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,619
This ball couldn't be him, now could it?

222
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,384
Where are you?

223
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:04,128
This you? Curled up like a ball?
You wanted some, didn't you?

224
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,169
Well, turn around, take a look at that pussy.

225
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:10,537
You know you want to!

226
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:15,671
Your turn after, amigo!

227
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,308
Come on, get up and get IT up!

228
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,017
I...

229
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,583
I...

230
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

231
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,057
Hurt you!

232
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,223
No way!

233
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:44,367
Ha! Did you hear that, gonna hurt you, he said!

234
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:48,038
Put a bullet in him, on cue, just when he said,
"Hur!" Out the front before "t!"

235
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,111
Miserable loser!

236
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,789
That's not funny.

237
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:05,120
I was looking at you, you're gross!

238
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,724
What are you saying bro'?

239
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:13,302
Too gross. Don't move! You piss me off!

240
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,441
- I'm sorry, forgive me, please!
- Don't move!

241
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:18,806
I'll do anything!

242
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,310
ATTEN-TION!

243
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:29,585
Say "shit-pee-dick" 10 times, very fast.

244
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,856
And add a kiss to the last one!

245
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,051
Bro'!

246
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,653
Add a kiss and I'll forgive you!

247
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:48,340
Shit-pee-dick! Shit-pee-dick!
Shit-pee-dick!

248
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,171
Er, Shit-pee-dick-smack!

249
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,674
You promised!

250
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:08,553
Think about what you did on your way to hell.

251
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:15,696
Sorry about the trouble,
but it's the owner's!

252
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,469
Ah, forget it!

253
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,505
I'll have a beer and a stick!

254
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,731
If I only had one of those magic time belts,
turn it back!

256

257
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,211
Nishi, are you there?

258
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:45,282
Where is he, this way?

259
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,786
This ball couldn't be him, now could it?

260
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:57,063
This you? You wanted some, didn't you?
Well turn around and...

261
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,002
I...

262
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,537
I...

263

I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

264
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,567
I'm gonna hurt you!

265
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,020
- I'm
- No!

266
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,489
- Gonna
- Stop!

267
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,865
- Hurt you
- Stop, please!

268
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:29,017

00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:34,755

OK, I get it! I'm not cool!
I'm useless! And no fun!

274

I'm a snot, I know! So, stop this!

00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,385
Stop! Stop!

276
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,552
STOP!

277
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,248
Something's wrong with my eyes!

278
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:33,253
I keep changing, right?

279
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,722
You can't decide what I should look like!

280
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,360
Who are you?

281
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,467
You know! It's flickering there in your mind!

282
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,574
Come on, let it go.

283
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:57,808
What's the first thing that comes to mind?

284
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,907

00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,817
Go... God!

00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,220
There we are!
Not that how you call me matters!

287
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:09,658
'A', 'B', they're just symbols anyway!

288
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,431
Confused? Wanna see my tits?

289
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:20,433
The only way to make it stop is to be honest.
Easier to see the truth that way!

290
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:26,943
The truth for you, that is!
Too late for counseling though.

291
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:33,210
Since you're DEAD! What a shame!

292
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:39,858
Dead! I'm... Dead?

293
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,227
Really?

294
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:48,623
Just like that? Gone at 20?

295
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:54,128
Why was I born then?

296
00:27:55,974 --> 00:28:02,880
So you could have fun at my expense?!

297
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,143
What's wrong with that, huh?

298
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:18,727
Yeah, so I made you on a whim!
I made you, dipshit, for my sheer enjoyment!

299
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,965
What's wrong with that?

300
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,997
Oops, I have to go!

301
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,173
- Got a date!
- A date?!

302
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:38,407
Time's up. Go straight that way
and keep walking. You'll soon disappear.

303
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,678
And my next life?

304
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,015
- Huh?
- Next life?

305
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:48,651
Your what? Told you it's over. Start walking!

306
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:57,025
And disappear? No afterlife? We're done?

307
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:02,365
It's really over?!

308
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:07,212
Really, really, really over?! God?

309
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:16,918
Will you shut up! You saw how you got here,
multiple point of views of your brain exploding.

310
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:22,417
A shocking documentary of your death,
deftly edited by Moi!

311
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:28,657
You are DEAD!

312
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:35,832
I'm officially dead?

313
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,108
Them's the breaks, Nishi.

314
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,092
Straight ahead and disappear!

315
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:08,831
So if I go the other way...

316
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,305
Hey! What're you doing?! I'll be late!

317
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,442
Wait!

318
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,487
Let me through, I'm going back!

319
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:26,857
Not down for the count, huh?

320
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:34,130
You're gonna fade away, that's how it works.
See, you're already fading.

321
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:42,873
I don't believe you! I'm not gonna disappear!
I'm going back!

322
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,272
Won't happen!

323
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:48,335
I'll make it, I'll get there, you'll see!

324
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:56,151
Not bad, can you keep it up?
With that brain? Body?

325
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,822
I'm gonna take care of that creep!

326
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:03,894
Be stronger! Determined! Free and happy!

327
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:07,329
Live life to the fullest!

328
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,066
Pretty good!

329
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:18,308
Alright give it your best shot!

330
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:23,074
YES! I'm going back! I'm gonna do this!

331
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,877
I'm on your side! I'm on your side!

332
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:34,886
Your turn after, amigo. Get up and get IT up!

333
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:42,163
Never! Never!

334
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,698
Never again!

335
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,702
Don't move!

336
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,408
Yang, come here.

337
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:10,317
I'll blow your head off if you move,
I'm done being the loser!

338
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,222
Give me the car keys!

339
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,596
Nishi!

340
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,798
You're on your own sir, come on, let's roll!

341
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:22,805
Hey!

342
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,102
Get in!

343
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,436
Wait!

344
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,244
Atsu got wasted!

345
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:39,786
My fault! They're in my car, we'll get them.

346
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,452
My apologies!

347
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,341
Nishi, watch out!

348
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,509
Help!

349
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:10,017
And a hero is born!

350
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,851
Hands on the wheel!

351
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:18,363
Don't worry, I'm on it! I'll protect you!
I love you both!

352
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:25,594
Moron, eyes on the road! Why are we running?
We should go to the police, self defense, right?

353
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:32,974
No! No! No! No cops, no questions,
no regrets! I'm through with that!

354
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:36,514
Making a break for it, with you two!
Like I want!

355
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:40,642
No one's gonna get in my way!

356
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:45,280
I'm following my heart's desires!
Like an outlaw!

357
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,904
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

358
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:12,407
<i>I do hope you realize you were living
in paradise till today.</i>

359
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:19,849
<i>Like angels flying around in heaven.</i>

360
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:25,091
<i>But now you're on a super express to hell!</i>

361
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:37,270
The guy you smoked, that bald SOB, Atsu?

362
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:45,908
Fine football player and athlete,
known as the Maradona of Osaka!

363
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:51,146
For good and for bad reasons.

364
00:34:51,656 --> 00:35:00,530
Beautiful bod' like a wild animal!
Not that it has to do with anything.

365
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:13,275
You knew Atsu was packing, that the car was full of
drugs and money, you knew all that, you planned it.

366
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:17,337
A clear cut armed robbery and murder case.

367
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:25,221
His folks abandoned him,
he grew up without love!

368
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:30,785
Got tickets for the World Cup,
for him and his girl.

369
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:34,525
A model Japanese footie fan.

370
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:42,632
But just before the game,
a young guy like you puts out his light.

371
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:47,569
Ah, the ever-egocentric,
unfeeling youth of today!

372
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:52,249
<i>Immature adults on the loose,
everything a blur except their friends.</i>

373
00:35:52,350 --> 00:36:03,818
<i>Living life like a video game,
finger on the reset button!</i>

374
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:08,127
<i>You're a roller-coaster with no breaks!</i>

375
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,328
It's not true, you're making it up.

376
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:21,172
Typical story, nice and easy
for the cops to follow!

377
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:28,113
What I'm sayin' is, nobody's on your side!

378
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,817
This is it, kids! Make it a good game!

379
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,393
Nice speech old man.

380
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,429
Will you stop it!

381
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:46,132
- I can see you sweating in front of a prompter!
- Nishi!

382
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,135
It's improv!

383
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,838
OK!

384
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,038
What?!

385
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:04,780
This roller-coaster you're trying to stop
is a genuine Angel Express!

386
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,422
And I can see you moved to tears
as you watch that mystic angel!

387
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:15,056
Spread its wings and disappear into the sky.

388
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,295
The fuck?!

389
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,225
Fuck!

390
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,933
Nishi!

391
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,764
Offside!

392
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:04,676
Asshole, this ain't football!

393
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,879
Now get in as close as you can!

394
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,216
Offside-trap!

395
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,049
STUNT DRIVING!

396
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:25,995
My nose is bleeding!

397
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:26,995
Mine too!

398
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,793
Mine too!

399
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,560
The bridge!

400
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,878
What the fuck are you doing?!

401
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,438
My Pitch, my little pitch!

402
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,973
Pitch! You came back! Pitch!

403
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,593
No more fooling around.

404
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,098
<i>We'll get 'em on the bridge.</i>

405
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:43,197
Perfect defense plan. Even Zidane and Figo
couldn't get through. We'll get 'em.

406
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,747
Whale?

407
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,272
What, you again?!

408
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,308
Not just yet!

409
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,041
You there, Nishi?

410
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,246
Are we... dead?

411
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,046
You both there? Wait a sec!

412
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,751
Where is it?

413
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:08,189
Bingo!

414
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,363
We're alive!

415
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:14,929
Thank God!

416
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,365
Seawater? Can't see shit.

417
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,232
Near the harbour, maybe.

418
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,533
Smells fishy!

419
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,573
Have no fear!

420
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:34,584
Fear takes the shape we're willing to give it!

421
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:37,917
Let's light a candle in our hearts,
make it gleam.

422
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,818
Try to enjoy the moment!

423
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,519
In spite of this turn of events.

424
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,426
<i>"This is FUN"</i>

425
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:49,026
This will shed a new light on things!

426
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,361
Remember our days in grade school?

427
00:42:55,773 --> 00:43:00,972
When it was all play,
no restrictions or tomorrows?

428
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:04,776
We didn't end up here 'cos we were chased!

429
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:08,678
We came here seeking adventure!
An epic journey!

430
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,085
Let the party begin!

431
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,721
Hey, there's a boat!

432
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,392
Let's check it out!

433
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:28,068
Lane No. 1, Nishi! 3rd Grade! And I'm off!

434
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,368
Hey, let's go.

435
00:43:36,748 --> 00:43:41,378
Lane No. 2, Myon!
Also, 3rd Grade, and here I go!

436
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,968
Wow, what a wreck.

437
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,335
Where are we?

438
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,904
Stinks!

439
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:39,104
I'm starving! Good for my figure, though!

440
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,974
Your body is DOPE!

441
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,516
Which you haven't seen. I just look slim.

442
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:47,511
Show me then!

443
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,949
No way!

444
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,315
Please!

445
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,183
Nope!

446
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:52,756
Please!

447
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,718
Sugar on top!

448
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,622
Nah!

449
00:44:55,727 --> 00:45:00,061
- Aw, c'mon!
- Nishi! What now, huh?!

450
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,264
You almost got us killed!

451
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,699
Sure they were scum,
but you also popped a guy!

452
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07,802
What's with the "enthusiasm?"

453
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:13,634
I was killed! Shot by that creep!

454
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:17,579
What the hell are you talking about?
He's the one that's gone, dodo!

455
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:22,881
Before that. See, I was so scared
I lucked out on getting angry.

456
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,979
And that's when he shot me! Cueball mother!

457
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,289
Then I was sucked up to heaven and...

458
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:31,218
You've lost it.

459
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:35,993
But I believed in myself,
believed like nothing else, and I was back!

460
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,400
To live true to yourself,
sincerely, without restraint!

461
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:44,908
I realized it's the only weapon
against any wall!

462
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:51,739
OK, you've lost me.
But THIS is where it got us!

463
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,818
We're only here 'cos we were lucky!

464
00:45:55,052 --> 00:46:00,115
It's a miracle we're alive!
But if this keeps up, we'll be dead in no time!

465
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,534
I... I...

466
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,897
I...

467
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:20,237
I've got... a radio!

468
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:23,872
A radio?

469
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,677
This place is dangerous, we need to move!

470
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,576
Hurry! Hurry!

471
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,557
- What the fuck?!
- C'mon, hurry!

472
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,523
- What is this?
- An earthquake? A tsunami?

473
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,966
- You guys are reckless!
- The fuck, old man?!

474
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:51,337
Hurry up! Grab an ore and row!

475
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,012
- Tidal wave?
- Tsunami!

476
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,416
Move it, people!

477
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:05,482
Over there!

478
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,750
Almost there!

479
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,524
Hang on!

480
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:33,048
Meal time's over. We're OK now!

481
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:35,852
Let's go up!

482
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:59,500
Wow! It's like a top secret lair!

483
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:05,507
TV, microwave, audio set, PC,
you've got everything!

484
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,842
So they just washed up?

485
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,914
Ah, and food!

486
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:17,192
And sexy lingerie! You dirty old man!

487
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,961
Let's see what's inside.

488
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,533
No power, huh?
This stuff's just for show, then?

489
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:27,932
Gross!

490
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,870
Think of it as modern art!

491
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,940
Want to freshen up?

492
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:38,508
Plenty of clean hot water?

493
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:41,585
- You mean have a bath?
- Yes! Yes!

494
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,817
I'd like that!

495
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,549
Yeah? Me too!

496
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,400
This is bliss!

497
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:09,406
But boy we're in some mess! It's surreal!

498
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:15,217
I mean, we're in God-knows-where
enjoying a total stranger's hospitality!

499
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:19,050
Having a bath! Unbelievable.

500
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,292
Well, he's on the way to a Happy Meal,
but he seems nice!

501
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:01,621
Once a perv, always a perv, huh?

502
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:06,127
I feel like it's the first time
we're having a real talk.

503
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,867
We'll leave clean clothes here!

504
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:17,138
Those bastards! Not very subtle are they?!

505
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:20,445
Let's pretend they're costumes!

506
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:23,281
Hey, find something we can actually wear!

507
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,016
Wow! Looks amazing!

508
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,815
You made this?

509
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,524
Gramps?

510
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,521
Should've seen him at work!

511
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:37,761
Really? It's like a NY sushi bar!

512
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,031
Where'd you learn to cook, gramps?

513
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,572
Whoa!

514
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,249
Yeah, it's delicious!

515
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,977
5 stars in my book!

516
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,583
Bon apetit!

517
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,024
Wow.

518
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,387
What a meal!

519
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,926
Thanks!

520
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:07,862
Much better than some fancy
rotating sushi bar in Kita.

521
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:13,701
They started serving
Westernized sushi last year.

522
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,567
Rotating sushi bars.

523
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:19,001
Rotating sushi.

524
00:51:19,477 --> 00:51:21,672
Rotating sushi!

525
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,838
Not like that!

526
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,140
No, no.

527
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,844
In front of the customers.

528
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,116
Mine's dead too!

529
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,796
It's a cell phone?

530
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:43,458
A phone, a mobile phone?!

531
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,535
I knew it!

532
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,230
So, can we make contact with
the outside world?

533
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:54,474
Can't! It's soaked! Probably a goner!

534
00:51:55,946 --> 00:52:00,110
So, um, do robots exist now?

535
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:05,849
I saw a robot aisle at the hardware
store the other day!

536
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:07,021
Yeah?

537
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,958
Yes! I knew it!

538
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:17,968
- How about flying cars?
- Huh?

539
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,738
Hmm, how long have you been here exactly?

540
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,579
More than 30 years!

541
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,510
I had a big deal going down!

542
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:38,019
Hid my stash in a comic book case!

543
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:44,252
But I took the wrong one!

544
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,334
Coastguards and DEA knew all about it anyway.

545
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,008
Was running, lights flashing everywhere!

546
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:05,978
When a huge whale swallowed me!

547
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,974
Couldn't believe it.

548
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,888
And then what?

549
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:17,289
Got caught in the waves!

550
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,896
It was pitch dark when I came around!

551
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,226
Tried to escape but the waves were too rough!

552
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:28,666
<i>"TIME BOY"
Tried again! And again.</i>

553
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:35,877
I couldn't have survived without my friends.

554
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:40,683
Um, where's the toilet?

555
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:45,187
The washroom? Straight ahead! I'll take you!

556
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:49,157
Nah, it's okay! Straight ahead, right?

557
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,764
Oh my God!

558
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:15,117
Hey, keep talking!

559
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:23,115
- Where's the "exit?"
- All the way down there!

560
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,920
- Oh, right!
- But of course!

561
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,120
Back to square one!

562
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:32,562
Got to know your own limits!

563
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:53,318
We're outta here!

564
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,517
We can go this way.

565
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:01,496
It's wobbling!

566
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,992
It's the only way, c'mon!

567
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,499
It'll be alright!

568
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,040
You'll get killed!

569
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,576
He's hungry again!

570
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:18,915
Hurry!

571
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,881
Come back!

572
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,417
Wait!

573
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,281
- The water's coming!
- Nishi!

574
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:30,784
There! The exit!

575
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:34,826
Put these on!

576
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,265
Nishi! Come back!

577
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,769
Nishi!

578
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,867
Hey, let go of me!

579
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:21,342
What the?!

580
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:37,955
Nishi, you're awake!

581
00:56:38,295 --> 00:56:42,288
What a relief! He's come around!

582
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,536
And here's something to cheer you up!

583
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:49,902
<i>And a "Happy Mornin'" to y'all!</i>

584
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,998
<i>Wow, is this a beautiful day or what?</i>

585
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:57,672
<i>You wouldn't believe how blue the sky was
this morning.</i>

586
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,681
In line with the solar system!

587
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:04,243
Thought I'd drive
all the way to Brazil, y'know?

588
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,687
<i>Well, it's gonna be booming
at the resorts today!</i>

589
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:13,730
<i>Certainly not a day for school
or work, I tell ya!</i>

590
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:21,798
Now, now, now!

591
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,835
C'mon, cheer up!

592
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:30,710
You're homesick, I've been there.
I cried and got angry too.

593
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,749
But I realized after coming here!

594
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:36,581
Oh, whatever!

595
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,017
Got an idea! There's a place
that'll cheer you up.

596
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,784
Great friends too!

597
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:44,122
Let's go! Everybody!

598
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:48,092
<i>So wrecked cars are popping up everywhere!</i>

599
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,258
<i>Must've been some monster car chase!</i>

600
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:54,602
You haven't eaten properly in 3 days!

601
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,798
You're not gonna last that way!

602
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:59,842
You need to eat for your breasts' sake!

603
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,878
And Nishi, you've eaten nothing!

604
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,971
Forget about getting it up!

605
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,078
Hey!

606
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:10,752
Just shut up, okay?

607
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:32,868
Gramps, will you take me to that fun place
you mentioned about?

608
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:35,745
Wanna go? It'll be fun!

609
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,071
I need a change!

610
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,946
That's the spirit! You'll love it!

611
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:43,110
Nishi?

612
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,653
You too!

613
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:48,316
Nah! Count me out!

614
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:51,417
It'll be fun! You can meet my friends too!

615
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,190
Hearts'll sore! Heads'll explode!

616
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:57,732
Cut it, Gramps! I'm not in the mood!

617
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,529
Just leave me alone!

618
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,735
Join us later if you feel like it, okay?

619
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,502
Let's go, Myon.

620
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,744
Let's go, let's go!

621
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,707
This'll be a blast!

622
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,173
You'll love my friends.

623
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,960
Fuck! The look on his face!

624
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,297
He doesn't have a clue!

625
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:36,270
I only said those things
'cos he was being inconsiderate!

626
00:59:36,373 --> 00:59:38,102
How about a little kindness, huh?

627
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,369
I'm hurt!

628
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,206
I have doubts about humanity!

629
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,743
What about my start in manga?!

630
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:52,117
What about my glorious campus life, huh?!

631
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:58,452
Asshole!

632
00:59:58,562 --> 01:00:00,052
Loser!

633
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:21,374
<i>"Help me God I'm sorry"</i>

634
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:29,749
<i>30 years! 30 years!</i>

635
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:48,169
<i>Gotta drink your milk, honey!</i>

636
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:04,718
<i>30 years!</i>

637
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:33,748
You okay?

638
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,614
Isn't it amazing, Nishi?

639
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:44,192
Gramps, I...

640
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:48,628
Er, what I said back there was...

641
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:55,301
I'd become a bad person!

642
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:58,374
I wanted to boast about my evil ways.

643
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:02,104
I wanted to be known as a tough, rugged man!

644
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:05,545
I wanted to walk over everybody.

645
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,051
But I wound up here and...

646
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:11,453
I struggled!

647
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,683
But I managed to survive!

648
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,260
I can swim again!

649
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:22,127
Catch things, walk, see.

650
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,429
Isn't that fun?

651
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:30,666
Seawater's salty! This place stinks!
But it gives me joy!

652
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:36,110
Would you rather lie around doing nothing?
Or would you rather feel alive?

653
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,073
Which is more fun?

654
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:08,687
She sure can swim!

655
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,529
She wanted to go to the Olympics
till she was about 15.

656
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,966
Had a coach and all.

657
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:17,198
Come to think of it,
I remember her winning something!

658
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,400
Bronze at the Kinki Races.

659
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,872
Stopped when her boobs got bigger!

660
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,743
No kidding! Gotta go with the flow, huh?

661
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:28,477
Yeah, with the flow!

662
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,485
How is it?

663
01:06:35,425 --> 01:06:38,087
Wow! Fantastic!

664
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:41,493
Right, my turn!
Quality entertainment coming up!

665
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,377
Got one!

666
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,453
Nishi!

667
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:45,079
Nishi, remember when we found a stray dog?

668
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:46,921
In kindergarten?

669
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:50,288
And you said you'd take care of it?

670
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:53,352
That made me so happy!

671
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,930
Yeah?

672
01:08:55,532 --> 01:08:58,524
I'm gonna take him home with me.

673
01:08:58,902 --> 01:09:01,462
You will? Thank you!

674
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:05,029
I already have a sea-monkey, so it'll be fine!

675
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:10,673
Wanna see? C'mon, I'll show ya!

676
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:12,442
Myon.

677
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:15,583
So this is the new plot!

678
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:18,217
In the far, distant future,

679
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:22,815
where the world is starving from
over-population and environmental destruction,

680
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:27,790
Earth decides to send
a spaceship in search of food.

681
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:33,535
But something goes wrong.

682
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:38,197
They land on a strange planet.

683
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:43,041
There's water and oxygen,
but nothing edible for humans!

684
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:49,211
Except for one thing, they soon discover:

685
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,617
A certain creature's pooh.

686
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,126
Oh, gross!

687
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:03,631
And it's the perfect food for humans.

688
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,894
<i>"It's delicious!"
And it's the perfect food for humans.</i>

689
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:10,634
But the creature's unbelievably bad at hunting
and on the verge of extinction!

690
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,331
There's only one?

691
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:17,340
Our men help the creature hunt, look after it!

692
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:22,546
And they live like that for a while
until a new enemy arrives.

693
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:28,388
Higher species of plants begin to fight
for food, which is also creature chips!

694
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,322
A pooh-war, huh?

695
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,920
But what happens then? The crew?

696
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:39,026
Guess we need to send them home safely, huh?

697
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:42,993
The planet is ideal in its own way, but...

698
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:48,705
In fact, the planet's some kind of cell!

699
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:52,406
Our crew must've ended up there
after being shrunk!

700
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:53,709
A cell?

701
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,943
Yeah, of a human body.

702
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:57,212
Whose?

703
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:58,246
Yours!

704
01:10:58,354 --> 01:10:59,651
Mine?

705
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:04,382
Let's just say! It was the leader's fault.

706
01:11:04,961 --> 01:11:10,524
His love for his girl,
his determination to find that planet,

707
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:13,761
his desperation led the ship there.

708
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:19,267
But one day, they realize
their bodies have grown bigger.

709
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,637
Why?

710
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,108
Wonder why!

711
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:28,214
And they hear a voice! From inside your tummy

712
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:31,617

We're growing bigger and bigger!"

01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:33,552
Yikes!

714
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:38,252
But they can communicate that way.
And they realize they're inside your stomach.

715
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:39,623
- Then what?
- They've gotta get out!

716
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:42,459
- From where?
- At this point, they're moving along the colon!

717
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:43,793
Not happening!

718
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:47,366
But what else can they do?
They keep getting bigger.

719
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:48,694
Your belly'll explode!

720
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:51,740
- I said no!
- "We're almost out, don't flush us!"

721
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:53,365
I AM flushing them!

722
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,811
"We're out! We're out!"

723
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:58,237
