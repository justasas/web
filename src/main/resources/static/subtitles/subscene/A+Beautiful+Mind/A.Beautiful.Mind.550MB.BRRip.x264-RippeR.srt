00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:27,895
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY - SEPTEMBER 1947

2
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,273
Mathematicians won the war.

3
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:36,070
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes...

4
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,195
...and built the A-bomb.

5
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,282
Mathematicians, like you.

6
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:46,288
<i>The stated goal of the Soviets</i>
<i>is global Communism.</i>

7
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:48,832
In medicine or economics...

8
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:50,957
...in technology or space...

9
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:53,335
...battle lines are being drawn.

10
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:56,672
<i>To triumph, we need results...</i>

11
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:59,883
<i>...publishable, applicable results.</i>

12
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:02,844
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

13
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:06,139
The next Einstein?

14
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:09,477
<i>Who among you will be</i>
<i>the vanguard of democracy...</i>

15
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,688
<i>...freedom, and discovery?</i>

16
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:16,527
<i>Today, we bequeath America's future</i>
<i>into your able hands.</i>

17
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:20,489
<i>Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.</i>

18
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,509
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,554
No, he wants it all for himself.

20
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:47,224
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.

21
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:51,646
He has his sights set on
Wheeler Lab, MIT's military think-tank.

22
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,023
<i>They're only taking one this year.</i>

23
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,984
Hansen's used to
being picked first.

24
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,736
Yeah, he's wasted on math.

25
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,027
He should be running for president.

26
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:13,751
There could be a mathematical explanation
for how bad your tie is.

27
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:20,715
Thank you.

28
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:23,845
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

29
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:26,973
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.

30
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:30,059
At least that's what he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?

31
00:03:30,224 --> 00:03:32,311
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.

32
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:34,438
- And you are?
- Am I late?

33
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:37,441
- Yes, Mr. Sol.
- Oh, good. Hi.

34
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:40,987
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- The burden of genius.

35
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:43,448
- There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.

36
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,160
- Mr. Sol.
- How are you, sir?

37
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,953
- Bender.
- Nice to see you.

38
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:49,789
- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
- Thank you.

39
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:51,624
I'll take another.

40
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,001
Excuse me?

41
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:56,337
Pardon me.
I assumed you were the waiter.

42
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,090
- Play nice.
- Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.

43
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,509
Honest mistake.

44
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,551
<i>Well, Martin Hansen.</i>

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,429
It is Martin, isn't it?

46
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:07,599
Why, yes, John, it is.

47
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:11,186
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

48
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,816
I've read your preprints...

49
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:18,317
...both of them.

50
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,069
The one on Nazi ciphers...

51
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:22,614
...and the other one
on nonlinear equations...

52
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:26,535
...and I am supremely confident
that there is not a single seminal...

53
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:29,286
...or innovative idea in either one of them.

54
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,000
Enjoy your punch.

55
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:39,965
Gentlemen, meet John Nash...

56
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:42,968
<i>...the mysterious West Virginia genius.</i>

57
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,054
<i>The other winner</i>
<i>of the distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.</i>

58
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:47,764
- Okay.
- Yeah?

59
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:49,141
Of course.

60
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:22,341
Oh, Christ.

61
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:26,137
The prodigal roommate arrives.

62
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,806
Roommate?

63
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,224
Oh, God, no.

64
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:35,647
Did you know that
having a hangover...

65
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:38,567
...is not having enough water
in your body...

66
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:40,611
...to run your Krebs cycle?

67
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:44,990
<i>Which is exactly what happens to you</i>
<i>when you're dying of thirst.</i>

68
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:48,203
So, dying of thirst...

69
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:51,372
...would probably feel...

70
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:56,212
<i>...pretty much like the hangover</i>
<i>that finally bloody kills you.</i>

71
00:05:58,297 --> 00:05:59,715
John Nash?

72
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,425
Hello.

73
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:03,136
Charles Herman.

74
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:05,012
Pleased to meet you.

75
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,733
All right! Well done!

76
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:25,033
Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.

77
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:29,329
<i>Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.</i>
<i>His name was Johnny Walker.</i>

78
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,419
Whew.

79
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,839
Well, I got in last night
in time for...

80
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,216
...English department cocktails.

81
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:41,759
Cock was mine...

82
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:46,264
...the tail belonged to a particularly
lovely young thing with a passion for...

83
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:50,101
...D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily distracted, are you?

84
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:52,854
- I'm here to work.
- Are you? Right.

85
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:54,730
I see. Crikey!

86
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,784
Is my roommate a dick?

87
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,455
Hmm?

88
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:12,415
Listen.

89
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:14,543
If we can't break the ice...

90
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:17,421
...how about we drown it?

91
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,349
So what's your story?

92
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:33,645
<i>You the poor kid that never got to go</i>
<i>to Exeter or Andover?</i>

93
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:37,316
Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm well-balanced.

94
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,109
I have a chip on both shoulders.

95
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,907
Maybe you're just better with
the old integers than you are with people.

96
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,744
My first grade teacher said
I was born with two helpings of brain...

97
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,871
...but only half a helping of heart.

98
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:54,415
Wow! She sounds lovely!

99
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,252
The truth is that I...

100
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,254
I don't like people much.

101
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:01,715
And they don't much like me.

102
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:04,760
But why,
with all your obvious wit and charm?

103
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,057
Seriously, John.

104
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,310
Mathematics...

105
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:16,606
Mathematics is never going to lead you
to a higher truth.

106
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,399
And you know why?

107
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,487
Because it's boring. It's really boring.

108
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:25,741
You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?

109
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:29,286
I cannot waste time
with these classes and...

110
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:31,163
<i>...these books.</i>

111
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,543
Memorizing the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!

112
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,337
I need to look through...

113
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:43,842
...to the governing dynamics.

114
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:49,682
Find a truly original idea.

115
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:52,518
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

116
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:55,312
- It's the only way that I'll ever...
- Matter.

117
00:08:58,189 --> 00:08:59,817
Yes.

118
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,530
- All right, who's next?
- I've played enough go for today.

119
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,365
- Come on.
- I hate this game.

120
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:08,116
Cowards, all of you!

121
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:10,369
None of you rise to meet my challenge?

122
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:13,997
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,
Sol does his laundry all semester.

123
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:17,083
- Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
- Not at all.

124
00:09:19,294 --> 00:09:21,255
- Look at him.
- Nash!

125
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:23,174
Taking a reverse constitutional?

126
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:26,718
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm
to define their movement.

127
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:31,057
Oh.

128
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:32,768
Psycho.

129
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:37,396
I thought you dropped out.
You ever going to go to class or...

130
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:39,775
Classes will dull your mind.

131
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:43,029
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

132
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:44,780
Oh, I didn't know that.

133
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:47,199
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.

134
00:09:47,784 --> 00:09:51,621
Which is another way of saying
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.

135
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:54,414
You scared?

136
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:57,126
Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.

137
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:58,877
Stupefied by you.

138
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,506
No starch.

139
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:03,591
Pressed and folded.

140
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:08,554
Let me ask you something, John.

141
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:10,222
Be my guest, Martin.

142
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:14,394
Bender and Sol here correctly completed
Allen's proof of Perron's conjectures.

143
00:10:14,477 --> 00:10:16,145
Adequate work...

144
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:18,607
...without innovation.

145
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:21,401
- I'm flattered. You flattered?
- Flattered.

146
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:25,740
And I've got two weapons briefs
under security review by the DOD.

147
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,784
Derivative drivel.

148
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:32,163
But Nash achievements--
Zero.

149
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:35,375
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual question coming?

150
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,963
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

151
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:45,010
How will it feel
when I'm chosen for Wheeler...

152
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,262
...and you're not?

153
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,268
What if you lose?

154
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:04,905
You should not have won.

155
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:05,739
Hmm.

156
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,826
I had the first move, my play was perfect.

157
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,660
The hubris of the defeated.

158
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:12,328
The game is flawed.

159
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,881
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

160
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:30,847
You've been in here
for two days.

161
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:36,313
You know Hansen
has just published another paper?

162
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,939
I can't even find a topic for my doctorate.

163
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:43,653
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

164
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,533
This is a group playing touch football.

165
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,288
<i>This is a cluster of pigeons</i>
<i>fighting over breadcrumbs.</i>

166
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:58,251
<i>And this is a woman who is chasing a man</i>
<i>who stole her purse.</i>

167
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:01,130
John, you watched a mugging.

168
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,799
That's weird.

169
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:05,550
In competitive behavior,
someone always loses.

170
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:09,137
Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.

171
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,723
See, if I could derive an equilibrium...

172
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:15,227
...where prevalence is
a non-singular event...

173
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,480
...where nobody loses.

174
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:21,025
Imagine the effect that would have
on conflict scenarios...

175
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,111
When did you last eat?

176
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:25,737
- When did you last eat?
- Currency exchange?

177
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,615
You know, food.

178
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:31,828
You have no respect for cognitive reverie,
you know?

179
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,288
Yes. But pizza...

180
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,584
Now, pizza I have enormous respect for.

181
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,463
And, of course, beer.

182
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,139
I have respect for beer.

183
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:53,559
I have respect for beer!

184
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,944
- Good evening, Neils.
- Hey, Nash.

185
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,864
Who's winning? You or you?

186
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:09,491
- Good evening, Nash.
- Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.

187
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:13,579
He's looking at you for sure.

188
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,626
Hey, Nash.

189
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:22,088
<i>Neils is trying to get your attention.</i>

190
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:24,174
- You're joking.
- Oh, no.

191
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,554
- Go with God.
- Come back a man.

192
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:35,809
- Fortune favors the brave.
- Bombs away.

193
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:41,816
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...

194
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,111
...dramatically improve with each attempt?

195
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,164
This is going to be classic.

196
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:27,868
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

197
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,294
I don't know what I'm required to say...

198
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,964
...in order for you
to have intercourse with me...

199
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:40,715
...but could we assume
that I've said all that?

200
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:43,969
Essentially we're talking about
fluid exchange, right?

201
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:46,263
So, could we just go straight to the sex?

202
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:49,725
Oh, that was sweet.

203
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:52,687
Have a nice night, asshole!

204
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:54,940
Ladies, wait!

205
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,737
I especially liked the bit
about fluid exchange. It was...

206
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:03,157
...really charming.

207
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:08,996
Walk with me, John.

208
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:11,581
<i>I've been meaning to talk with you.</i>

209
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:15,335
The faculty is completing mid-year reviews.

210
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,297
We're deciding
which placement applications to support.

211
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,758
Wheeler, sir.
That would be my first choice.

212
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:23,594
Actually, I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

213
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:27,891
Your fellows have attended classes.
They've written papers. They've published.

214
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:29,809
I'm still searching, sir, for my...

215
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:32,228
- Your original idea.
- Governing dynamics, sir.

216
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:36,357
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid
it's just not nearly good enough.

217
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,239
- May I?
- Thank you.

218
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:46,325
I'm working on manifold embedding.

219
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:48,703
My bargaining stratagems
show some promise.

220
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:52,080
If you could just arrange another meeting
with Professor Einstein.

221
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,291
I've repeatedly asked you for that.

222
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,710
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

223
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,128
John.

224
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:02,842
Do you see what they're doing there?

225
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:07,555
Congratulations, Professor Max.

226
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:10,266
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

227
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:12,893
It's the pens.

228
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:17,315
Reserved for a member of the department
that makes the achievement of a lifetime.

229
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,734
Now what do you see, John?

230
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:22,612
Recognition.

231
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:25,573
Well done, Professor.

232
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:28,076
Well, try seeing accomplishment.

233
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:29,994
Is there a difference?

234
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,833
You haven't focused.

235
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:40,256
I'm sorry, but up to this point, your record
doesn't warrant any placement at all.

236
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:45,970
Good day.

237
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,190
And my compliments to you, sir.

238
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:00,109
Thank you so much.

239
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:19,169
I can't see it.

240
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,220
Jesus Christ, John.

241
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:30,850
I can't fail.

242
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:33,727
- This is all I am.
- Come on, let's go out.

243
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,729
- I have to get something done.
- John!

244
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,109
- I can't keep staring into space.
- John, enough!

245
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:43,446
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules, read their books...

246
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,573
...do their classes.

247
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:48,243
Come on! Go on, bust your head!
Kill yourself.

248
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:51,330
Don't do it. Don't mess around.

249
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:55,167
Bust your head! Go on,
bust that worthless head wide open.

250
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:58,461
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?

251
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,092
It's not my problem.

252
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,054
And it's not your problem.

253
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:12,101
It's their problem.

254
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,437
Your answer isn't,
�face the wall.�

255
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,688
<i>It's out there...</i>

256
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,191
<i>...where you've been working.</i>

257
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,755
That was heavy.

258
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:48,513
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.

259
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,682
- He was onto something.
- Clever boy.

260
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,437
Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.

261
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,899
Oh, God.

262
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,611
- Incoming, gentlemen.
- Ay-yi-yi.

263
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:09,659
Deep breaths.

264
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:14,582
Nash, you might want to stop
shuffling your papers for five seconds.

265
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,546
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

266
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:23,176
We're not here for beer,
my friend.

267
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:26,178
Oh.

268
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:31,140
Does anyone else feel
she should be moving in slow motion?

269
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:33,769
Will she want a large wedding, you think?

270
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:36,023
Shall we say swords? Pistols at dawn?

271
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:37,857
Have you remembered nothing?

272
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:40,776
<i>Recall the lessons of Adam Smith...</i>

273
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:43,112
...the father of modern economics.

274
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:44,738
�In competition...

275
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:47,699
- �... individual ambition
serves the common good.�

276
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,744
Every man for himself, gentlemen.

277
00:19:49,869 --> 00:19:52,413
Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

278
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,165
I'm not going to strike out.

279
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,378
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

280
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,837
Nobody move.

281
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:01,756
<i>She's looking over here.</i>
<i>She's looking at Nash.</i>

282
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,177
Oh, God.
He may have the upper hand now...

283
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:06,304
<i>...but wait until he opens his mouth.</i>

284
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,305
<i>Remember the last time?</i>

285
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,641
That was one
for the history books.

286
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:20,360
- Adam Smith needs revision.
- What are you talking about?

287
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,654
If we all go for the blonde...

288
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:30,244
<i>...we block each other.</i>

289
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:33,247
<i>Not a single one of us is going to get her.</i>

290
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:36,040
<i>So then we go for her friends...</i>

291
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:42,506
<i>...but they will all give us the cold shoulder</i>
<i>because nobody likes to be second choice.</i>

292
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:45,093
Well, what if no one goes for the blonde?

293
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,179
<i>We don't get in each other's way...</i>

294
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:51,766
<i>...and we don't insult the other girls.</i>

295
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,143
That's the only way we win.

296
00:20:57,438 --> 00:20:59,273
That's the only way we all get laid.

297
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:06,573
Adam Smith said:

298
00:21:06,823 --> 00:21:08,784
�The best result comes...

299
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:12,911
"...from everyone in the group
doing what's best for himself.�

300
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:15,708
Right. Incomplete. Okay?

301
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:19,003
Because the best result will come...

302
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,296
...from everyone in the group...

303
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,592
...doing what's best for himself...

304
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:26,468
...and the group.

305
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:29,636
If this is some way for you
to get the blonde, go to hell.

306
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:33,141
Governing dynamics. Adam Smith...

307
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:36,395
...was wrong.

308
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,814
- Here we go.
- Careful, careful.

309
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,817
Thank you.

310
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,709
�C� of �S� equals �C� of �T.�

311
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,197
You do realize this flies in the face
of 150 years of economic theory?

312
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,405
Yes, I do, sir.

313
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:08,742
- That's rather presumptuous, no?
- It is, sir.

314
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,751
Well, Mr. Nash...

315
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:20,965
<i>...with a breakthrough of this magnitude...</i>

316
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,177
<i>...I'm confident you will get</i>
<i>any placement you like.</i>

317
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:32,767
<i>Wheeler Labs...</i>

318
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:36,481
<i>...they'll ask you to recommend</i>
<i>two team members.</i>

319
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:42,487
Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

320
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:44,449
Sol and Bender, sir.

321
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,119
Sol and Bender
are extraordinary mathematicians.

322
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,706
Has it occurred to you that Sol and Bender
might have plans of their own?

323
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:57,876
We made it!

324
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,921
Wheeler, we made it!

325
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:02,757
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

326
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:07,304
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.

327
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:29,284
Umm...

328
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,706
Governing dynamics.

329
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:38,420
Congratulations, John.

330
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:41,547
- Toast! To Wheeler Labs!
- To Wheeler!

331
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:56,813
THE PENTAGON 1953 - FIVE YEARS LATER

332
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:09,075
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

333
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,911
Dr. Nash, your coat?

334
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:12,371
Thank you, sir.

335
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:16,874
General, this is Wheeler team leader,
Dr. John Nash.

336
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,545
- Glad you could come, Doctor.
- Hello.

337
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,171
Right this way.

338
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,050
We've been intercepting
radio transmissions from Moscow.

339
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:30,431
<i>The computer can't detect a pattern,</i>
<i>but I'm sure it's code.</i>

340
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:32,891
Why is that, General?

341
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,934
Ever just know something,
Dr. Nash?

342
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:39,648
Constantly.

343
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:44,237
We've developed
several ciphers.

344
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:48,699
<i>If you'd like to review</i>
<i>our preliminary data?</i>

345
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:53,286
- Doctor?
- 6-7-3-7.

346
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,539
<i>0- 3-6...</i>

347
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:11,141
<i>8- 4-9-4.</i>

348
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:42,965
<i>9- 1-4-0-3-4.</i>

349
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:02,368
I need a map.

350
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,792
46-13-08, 67-46-90.

351
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:12,921
<i>Starkey Corners, Maine.</i>

352
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,966
48-03-01.

353
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,968
91-26-35.

354
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:21,888
<i>Prairie Portage, Minnesota.</i>

355
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:24,475
These are latitudes and longitudes.

356
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,477
There are at least 10 others.

357
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:30,189
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

358
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:32,858
Extraordinary.

359
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:36,695
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.

360
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,950
- Who's Big Brother?
- You've done your country a great service.

361
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,120
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.

362
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,917
Accompany Dr. Nash.

363
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,419
What are the Russians moving, General?

364
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,674
Captain Rogers will escort you
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.

365
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:56,883
<i>Thank you.</i>

366
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,012
Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

367
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,980
<i>None of those</i>
<i>who said they don't like the method...</i>

368
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:14,109
<i>...have told us any other method</i>
<i>they could use that would be effective.</i>

369
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,321
- It's Dr. Nash.
- All right.

370
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:27,330
WHEELER DEFENSE LABS
MIT CAMPUS

371
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,839
- Thank you, sir.
- Home run at the Pentagon?

372
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,384
Have they actually taken the word
�classified� out of the dictionary?

373
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,887
Hi. The air conditioning broke again.

374
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,140
How am I supposed to be in here
saving the world if I'm melting?

375
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:44,809
Our hearts go out to you.

376
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,396
Two trips to the Pentagon in four years.

377
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,064
- That's two more than we've had.
- It gets better.

378
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:53,817
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

379
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,613
You know, the Russians have the H-bomb,
the Nazis are repatriating South America...

380
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,783
...the Chinese have a standing army
of 2.8 million...

381
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,829
...and I am doing stress tests on a dam.

382
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,788
You made the cover of <i>Fortune</i> again.

383
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,751
Please note the use of the word �you,�
not �we.�

384
00:29:11,794 --> 00:29:13,879
That was supposed to be just me.

385
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:19,093
Not only do they rob me
of the Fields' Medal...

386
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,513
...they put me on the cover
of <i>Fortune</i> magazine with these hacks...

387
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:24,265
...these scholars of trivia.

388
00:29:24,474 --> 00:29:28,227
Exactly what's the difference
between genius and most genius?

389
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:30,229
Quite a lot.

390
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:34,024
He's your son.
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.

391
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:37,361
- I've always got 10 minutes.
- Before your new class?

392
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:46,579
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

393
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:49,205
You are a doctor, John, and no.

394
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,628
You know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities...

395
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:56,839
...MIT gets America's great minds of today,
teaching their great minds of tomorrow.

396
00:29:56,924 --> 00:30:00,218
- Poor bastards.
- Now, have a nice day at school.

397
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:01,887
The bell is ringing.

398
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,830
The eager young minds of tomorrow.

399
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:39,218
Can we leave one open,
Professor? It's really hot, sir.

400
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:44,974
Your comfort comes second
to my ability to hear my own voice.

401
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:51,772
Personally...

402
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,609
<i>...I think this class will be</i>
<i>a waste of your...</i>

403
00:30:56,695 --> 00:30:58,696
<i>...and what is infinitely worse...</i>

404
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:01,490
...my time.

405
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:06,035
However, here we are.

406
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,038
So you may attend or not.

407
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,917
You may complete your assignments
at your whim.

408
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,336
<i>We have begun.</i>

409
00:31:17,464 --> 00:31:18,339
Miss.

410
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:23,262
Excuse me!

411
00:31:24,097 --> 00:31:26,265
- Excuse me!
- Hey, hey!

412
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:27,390
Hi!

413
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,979
<i>We have a little problem.</i>

414
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,858
<i>It's extremely hot in here</i>
<i>with the windows closed...</i>

415
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:36,317
<i>...and extremely noisy with them open.</i>

416
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,986
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if there was any way you could...</i>

417
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,617
<i>...I don't know, maybe work</i>
<i>someplace else for about 45 minutes?</i>

418
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:45,785
- Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!

419
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,787
- Break!
- Got it!

420
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:50,624
Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.

421
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:56,046
As you will find in multivariable calculus,
there is often...

422
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:59,801
...a number of solutions
for any given problem.

423
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:05,932
As I was saying, this problem here...

424
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:09,436
<i>...will take some of you</i>
<i>many months to solve.</i>

425
00:32:10,146 --> 00:32:11,855
For others among you...

426
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:16,401
...it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

427
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,416
Professor Nash.

428
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,684
William Parcher.

429
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:48,811
Big Brother...

430
00:32:50,646 --> 00:32:52,147
<i>...at your service.</i>

431
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:55,067
What can I do
for the Department of Defense?

432
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:58,571
- Are you here to give me a raise?
- Let's take a walk.

433
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:02,867
- Impressive work at the Pentagon.
- Yes, it was.

434
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,954
Oppenheimer used to say, �A genius
sees the answer before the question.�

435
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:08,622
You knew Oppenheimer?

436
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:11,376
His project was under my supervision.

437
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,211
Which project?

438
00:33:16,506 --> 00:33:19,218
- That project.
- It's not that simple.

439
00:33:19,468 --> 00:33:21,010
Well, you ended the war.

440
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:24,640
We incinerated 150,000 people
in a heartbeat.

441
00:33:24,723 --> 00:33:27,560
Great deeds come at great cost,
Mr. Parcher.

442
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:33,898
Conviction, it turns out, is a luxury
of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

443
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:38,195
I'll try and keep that in mind.

444
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:43,450
So, John, no family...

445
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:45,952
<i>...no close friends.</i>

446
00:33:46,452 --> 00:33:50,207
- Why is that?
- I like to think it's because I'm a Ione wolf.

447
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,044
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

448
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:56,964
There are certain endeavors...

449
00:33:57,048 --> 00:34:01,052
...where your lack of personal connection
would be considered an advantage.

450
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:05,973
- This is a secure area.
- They know me.

451
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:10,395
Have you ever been here?

452
00:34:10,477 --> 00:34:14,399
We were told in our initial briefing
these warehouses were abandoned.

453
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:16,651
That's not precisely accurate.

454
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:55,816
By telling you this...

455
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:59,281
<i>...I am increasing your security clearance</i>
<i>to top secret.</i>

456
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:03,033
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

457
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:04,493
Get it?

458
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,830
What operation?

459
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,044
Those are a good idea.

460
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,928
This factory is in Berlin,
we seized it at the end of the war.

461
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:25,557
<i>Nazi engineers were attempting to build</i>
<i>a portable atomic bomb.</i>

462
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:30,479
The Soviets reached this facility
before we did, and we lost the damn thing.

463
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,233
The routing orders at the Pentagon.

464
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:38,528
They were about this, weren't they?

465
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:41,071
The Soviets aren't as unified
as people believe.

466
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:44,367
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself <i>Novaya Svoboda</i>...

467
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,037
...the �New Freedom,�
has control of the bomb...

468
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,748
...and intends to detonate it on U.S. Soil.

469
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:54,085
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

470
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:02,426
Man is capable of as much atrocity
as he has imagination.

471
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:07,642
<i>New Freedom has sleeper agents</i>
<i>here in the U.S.</i>

472
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:12,479
McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.

473
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:16,441
<i>New Freedom communicates</i>
<i>to its agents...</i>

474
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:19,694
...through codes imbedded in newspapers
and magazines...

475
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,489
...and that's where you come in.

476
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:25,033
<i>You see, John, what distinguishes you...</i>

477
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,620
...is that you are, quite simply...

478
00:36:29,205 --> 00:36:32,542
...the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

479
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:41,510
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

480
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:49,977
Commit this list of periodicals to memory.

481
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:55,149
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes, decipher them.

482
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:00,778
Place your chin on the chin rest.

483
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:04,283
- Stare into the light.
- Pulse 88, regular.

484
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,124
Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.

485
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,837
It's got a little zap to it,
doesn't it?

486
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:17,966
He just implanted a radium diode.

487
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:19,885
Don't worry, it's safe.

488
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,553
<i>The isotope decays predictably.</i>

489
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:26,015
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>these numbers change over time.</i>

490
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:29,144
They're the access codes to your drop spot.

491
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:33,857
So what am I now, a spy?

492
00:37:47,413 --> 00:37:48,456
Come.

493
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,128
Boy, you must be really important.

494
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:05,223
It's all right, Mike.

495
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:16,484
What are you working on?

496
00:38:18,528 --> 00:38:19,862
Classified.

497
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,450
Everyone waited half an hour.

498
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,287
- For?
- Class.

499
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,790
<i>You missed class today.</i>

500
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:32,668
Oh. I suspect that...

501
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:36,505
...nobody missed me.

502
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:39,133
The problem
that you left on the board...

503
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:41,927
...I solved it.

504
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,723
- No, you didn't.
- You didn't even look.

505
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:50,311
I never said that the vector fields
were rational functions.

506
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:56,442
Your solution is elegant.

507
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:01,281
Though on this particular occasion...

508
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,450
...ultimately incorrect.

509
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:29,143
- You're still here.
- I'm still here.

510
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:31,478
Why?

511
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:35,279
I'm wondering, Professor Nash...

512
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,074
...if I can ask you to dinner.

513
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:45,165
You do eat, don't you?

514
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:47,750
On occasion, yeah.

515
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:50,545
Table for one.
Prometheus alone chained to the rock...

516
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:53,340
...with the bird circling overhead,
you know how it is.

517
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:59,346
No, I expect that you wouldn't know...

518
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:06,520
Leave your address with my office.
I'll pick you up Friday...

519
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:09,648
...at 8:00 and we'll eat.

520
00:40:17,864 --> 00:40:22,201
One more thing. Do you have a name,
or should I just keep calling you �miss�?

521
00:40:24,871 --> 00:40:26,038
Governor...

522
00:40:26,163 --> 00:40:28,667
...may I present...
- Miss Alicia Larde.

523
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:33,380
Professor, please. You and the governor.

524
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:37,843
Wait, one second. I'm sorry.

525
00:40:38,927 --> 00:40:42,305
I want a copy of this.
First big date and all, you know.

526
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:45,643
<i>So, you boys need to look good...</i>

527
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:51,274
...which is not a state
you find yourselves in altogether naturally.

528
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:58,031
There. Better.

529
00:40:58,866 --> 00:41:01,951
- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.

530
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:03,411
Professor.

531
00:41:20,596 --> 00:41:22,471
God must be a painter.

532
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,893
<i>Why else would we have so many colors?</i>

533
00:41:28,895 --> 00:41:30,439
So you're a painter?

534
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:34,276
That's not actually what I said...

535
00:41:34,902 --> 00:41:38,364
...but, yes, I am.

536
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,000
Here.

537
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,460
Me.

538
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,045
Your date.

539
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:58,134
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

540
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:00,304
That's a plan.

541
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:05,851
Champagne would be lovely.

542
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,314
<i>I'll be outside.</i>

543
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:12,150
I will get the champagne.

544
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:22,076
Oh, thank you.

545
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,121
Thank you for that.

546
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:26,665
No, keep it.

547
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:30,335
I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.

548
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,631
- Do you?
- No.

549
00:42:34,757 --> 00:42:36,759
I don't believe in luck.

550
00:42:41,055 --> 00:42:43,766
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.

551
00:42:45,101 --> 00:42:46,935
Oh.

552
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,404
I once tried to count them all.

553
00:42:57,904 --> 00:43:02,076
I actually made it to 4,348.

554
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:05,998
You are exceptionally odd.

555
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:09,459
I bet you're very popular with the girls.

556
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:17,176
A pair of odd ducks, then.

557
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:20,179
Mmm.

558
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:24,391
Pick a shape.

559
00:43:26,476 --> 00:43:27,643
What?

560
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,690
Pick a shape, an animal, anything.

561
00:43:33,775 --> 00:43:34,817
Okay.

562
00:43:36,277 --> 00:43:37,571
An umbrella.

563
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:17,408
Do it again.

564
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:19,452
Do it again.

565
00:44:19,536 --> 00:44:23,122
- All right. What would you like?
- Do an octopus.

566
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:16,468
You don't talk much, do you?

567
00:47:16,594 --> 00:47:19,138
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

568
00:47:20,222 --> 00:47:21,848
I don't mean work.

569
00:47:26,562 --> 00:47:28,647
I find that polishing my interactions...

570
00:47:28,731 --> 00:47:32,318
...in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

571
00:47:33,861 --> 00:47:36,739
I have a tendency
to expedite information flow...

572
00:47:38,866 --> 00:47:40,368
...by being direct.

573
00:47:42,203 --> 00:47:45,373
- I often don't get a pleasant result.
- Try me.

574
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:48,877
All right.

575
00:47:53,423 --> 00:47:55,049
I find you attractive.

576
00:47:56,551 --> 00:48:00,472
Your aggressive moves towards me
indicate that you feel the same way.

577
00:48:01,013 --> 00:48:05,852
But still, ritual requires that we continue
with a number of platonic activities...

578
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,937
...before we have sex.

579
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:11,149
I am proceeding with those activities...

580
00:48:11,566 --> 00:48:13,609
...but in point of actual fact...

581
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:17,949
...all I really want to do is have intercourse
with you as soon as possible.

582
00:48:20,033 --> 00:48:22,161
Are you going to slap me now?

583
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:48,604
How was that result?

584
00:49:05,955 --> 00:49:07,499
What are you doing?

585
00:49:11,837 --> 00:49:15,966
Trying to isolate patterned reoccurrences
within periodicals over time.

586
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:17,216
And you?

587
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:19,261
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

588
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:25,517
Do I know you?

589
00:49:26,018 --> 00:49:29,312
My uncle says you're very smart
but not very nice...

590
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,232
...so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

591
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:34,276
And who might your uncle be?

592
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:36,069
The prodigal roommate...

593
00:49:37,029 --> 00:49:38,196
...returns.

594
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,703
Come here, Charles.

595
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:53,922
My sister got herself killed in a car crash.

596
00:49:55,632 --> 00:49:57,299
Not too far now, Marcee!

597
00:49:58,134 --> 00:50:02,640
<i>Her cowboy husband was too drunk</i>
<i>to know that he was too drunk to drive.</i>

598
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:04,767
So, I took her in.

599
00:50:06,644 --> 00:50:09,980
- She's so small.
- She's young. That's how they come.

600
00:50:12,524 --> 00:50:13,984
I'm at Harvard...

601
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:16,946
...doing the great author's workshop.

602
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:19,114
D.H. Bloody Lawrence.

603
00:50:19,365 --> 00:50:22,033
I really do think
you should buy yourself a new book.

604
00:50:24,328 --> 00:50:26,830
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

605
00:50:28,123 --> 00:50:29,583
How are you, John?

606
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:33,254
At first, all my work here was trivial...

607
00:50:33,672 --> 00:50:36,007
...but a new assignment came up and...

608
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:38,843
I can't really tell you any details.

609
00:50:38,926 --> 00:50:41,222
Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?

610
00:50:41,722 --> 00:50:43,307
Something like that.

611
00:50:43,723 --> 00:50:46,310
- And...
- Yes?

612
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:49,647
Well, I met a girl.

613
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:51,649
- No! A human girl?
- Homo sapien.

614
00:50:51,732 --> 00:50:54,527
- A biped?
- Yep. And contrary to all probabilities...

615
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:57,571
...she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.

616
00:50:58,114 --> 00:51:00,074
God, that's wonderful.

617
00:51:00,783 --> 00:51:03,618
There's no accounting for taste, is there?

618
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:09,751
- Should I marry her?
- Oh, God. Right.

619
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:15,257
I mean, everything's going well.
The job is fine. I have enough money.

620
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:17,009
It all seems to add up.

621
00:51:18,551 --> 00:51:20,678
But how do you know for sure?

622
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,473
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

623
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:28,145
That's the only sure thing I do know.

624
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:36,236
Good evening.

625
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:46,997
Alicia, please don't be angry.
I just lost track of time at work...

626
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,209
- Again.
- Mm-hmm.

627
00:51:51,752 --> 00:51:52,920
I'm sorry.

628
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:55,631
I didn't have time to wrap it.

629
00:51:56,798 --> 00:51:58,549
Happy birthday.

630
00:52:02,261 --> 00:52:06,642
The refractive faces of the glass
create a full wavelength dispersal...

631
00:52:06,725 --> 00:52:08,602
<i>...so if you look inside, you can see...</i>

632
00:52:08,685 --> 00:52:11,437
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

633
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:12,606
Yeah.

634
00:52:12,689 --> 00:52:16,693
Remember you said that time, God must
be a painter because of all the colors?

635
00:52:16,777 --> 00:52:19,165
At the governor's house you said that.

636
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:22,835
I didn't think you were listening.

637
00:52:25,087 --> 00:52:26,714
I was listening.

638
00:52:33,555 --> 00:52:35,515
It's beautiful.

639
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:54,951
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

640
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:59,206
Because I need some kind of proof,
some kind of verifiable, empirical data.

641
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:08,090
I'm sorry, just give me a moment...

642
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:12,052
...to redefine my girlish notions
of romance.

643
00:53:15,806 --> 00:53:17,056
A proof?

644
00:53:17,725 --> 00:53:19,310
Verifiable data.

645
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:22,145
Okay.

646
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:27,652
Well, how big is the universe?

647
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:29,029
Infinite.

648
00:53:29,362 --> 00:53:30,529
How do you know?

649
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:33,991
- Because all the data indicates it.
- But it hasn't been proven yet?

650
00:53:34,075 --> 00:53:36,786
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

651
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:39,873
I don't, I just believe it.

652
00:53:42,792 --> 00:53:44,960
It's the same with love, I guess.

653
00:53:52,594 --> 00:53:53,678
Now...

654
00:53:54,429 --> 00:53:56,598
...the part that you don't know...

655
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,560
...is if I want to marry you.

656
00:54:22,124 --> 00:54:23,960
Smile for the camera!

657
00:54:29,047 --> 00:54:30,549
Well done!

658
00:54:32,718 --> 00:54:34,386
Congratulations.

659
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:36,596
You look beautiful.

660
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:39,268
Hi, how are you?

661
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,111
- Bye-bye.
- 'Bye, now.

662
00:54:50,613 --> 00:54:51,781
<i>Be safe!</i>

663
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,169
CAMBRIDGE, MA - OCTOBER 1954

664
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:23,230
Get in. Hurry.

665
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:28,694
They're following us.

666
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:36,368
- Who is following us?
- The drop has been compromised.

667
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,662
Get down!

668
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,165
Stay down.

669
00:56:09,028 --> 00:56:11,405
- Take this.
- I ain't shooting anybody.

670
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:14,157
- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!

671
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:34,929
You stay back. Don't move.

672
00:57:21,728 --> 00:57:22,811
John?

673
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,155
Hi.

674
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,867
Where were you?

675
00:57:38,787 --> 00:57:41,081
- Sol...
- Yeah, I talked to Sol.

676
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,001
<i>He said you left the office hours ago.</i>

677
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,923
Why didn't you call me?

678
00:57:53,885 --> 00:57:55,346
Are you all right?

679
00:58:04,521 --> 00:58:05,606
Honey?

680
00:58:07,983 --> 00:58:09,236
John...

681
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,614
...please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

682
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,784
<i>John, open the door.</i>

683
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,746
Come on, open the door! Let me in!

684
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:21,957
Talk to me!

685
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,376
John!

686
00:58:26,126 --> 00:58:27,922
Open this door!

687
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,941
Watch for cars, kids.

688
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:30,195
John.

689
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:33,073
William.

690
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:35,992
<i>This is not what I signed up for.</i>

691
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:38,329
Every time a car backfires or a door slams...

692
00:59:38,454 --> 00:59:41,457
I understand better
than you could possibly imagine.

693
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:53,719
You need to calm down, John.

694
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:57,097
Now listen.
We're closing in on the bomb...

695
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:59,432
<i>...in large part due to your work.</i>

696
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:02,603
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

697
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:05,105
William, my circumstance has changed.

698
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,399
Alicia's pregnant.

699
01:00:16,032 --> 01:00:18,369
I told you attachments were dangerous.

700
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,996
<i>You chose to marry the girl.</i>

701
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:24,125
<i>I did nothing to prevent it.</i>

702
01:00:27,045 --> 01:00:29,506
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

703
01:00:30,257 --> 01:00:32,133
...is for you to continue your work.

704
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,553
Well, I'll just quit.

705
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,179
You won't.

706
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:37,972
Why would I not?

707
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:41,268
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

708
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:43,728
<i>You quit working for me...</i>

709
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:46,146
...I quit working for you.

710
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:01,954
Parcher!

711
01:01:07,335 --> 01:01:08,795
John, you all right?

712
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:31,192
John?

713
01:01:31,401 --> 01:01:33,863
Turn it off! Turn off the light!

714
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:38,367
Why would you do that?

715
01:01:39,076 --> 01:01:41,997
- Why would you turn the light on?
- What is wrong with you?

716
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:44,041
You have to go to your sister's.

717
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:48,128
I left the car out in back.
Take Commonwealth, no side streets.

718
01:01:48,253 --> 01:01:49,503
Stay where it's crowded.

719
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:51,256
John, I'm not going anywhere!

720
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,800
When you get to your sister's,
wait for my call.

721
01:01:53,925 --> 01:01:55,635
- Get your things.
- I'm not leaving!

722
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,387
Stop! Stop it!

723
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,556
Please, Alicia.

724
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,727
I'll explain when I can.

725
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:45,271
HARVARD UNIVERSITY
NATIONAL MATHEMATICS CONFERENCE

726
01:02:51,236 --> 01:02:52,528
Uncle John!

727
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,114
<i>Uncle John!</i>

728
01:02:58,327 --> 01:03:00,079
Hey, baby girl!

729
01:03:00,746 --> 01:03:02,707
Wow, someone needed a hug!

730
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,876
I saw you on the slate,
and I thought to myself:

731
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:10,256
�How can I miss seeing a guest lecture
by the inimitable John Nash?�

732
01:03:13,259 --> 01:03:14,510
What's wrong?

733
01:03:17,471 --> 01:03:20,432
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

734
01:03:20,932 --> 01:03:22,894
Now you tell me, what is it?

735
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:24,769
Professor Nash!

736
01:03:25,186 --> 01:03:26,271
Welcome!

737
01:03:28,733 --> 01:03:29,692
After?

738
01:03:37,909 --> 01:03:42,872
So, we see that the zeroes
of the Riemann Zeta function...

739
01:03:43,497 --> 01:03:45,708
...correspond to singularities...

740
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:48,210
<i>...in space-time...</i>

741
01:03:49,003 --> 01:03:51,338
Singularities in space-time then...

742
01:03:55,094 --> 01:03:57,096
And conventional number theory...

743
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,811
It breaks down
in the face of relativistic exploration.

744
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:23,122
Sometimes our expectations
are betrayed by the numbers.

745
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:29,671
Variables are impossible
to assign any rational value.

746
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:51,901
Professor Nash!

747
01:05:02,213 --> 01:05:04,716
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

748
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:11,682
Professor Nash,
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

749
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:14,018
What do you want?

750
01:05:14,934 --> 01:05:16,437
My name is Rosen.

751
01:05:16,854 --> 01:05:18,856
Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.

752
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,608
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.

753
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:24,486
I'd like you
to come with me, John.

754
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,489
Just for a chat.

755
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,242
It appears I have no choice.

756
01:05:42,421 --> 01:05:44,131
Help me! Somebody!

757
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:49,845
Somebody!

758
01:05:49,928 --> 01:05:52,556
<i>Help me! Get off me!</i>

759
01:05:53,097 --> 01:05:54,642
<i>I know who you are!</i>

760
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,477
No, no, don't!

761
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,230
Charles, they're Russians!
They're Russians!

762
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:00,898
<i>Call somebody! Call somebody!</i>

763
01:06:00,981 --> 01:06:03,024
- They're Russians!
- Steady the leg.

764
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:04,652
Get away from me.

765
01:06:04,735 --> 01:06:06,945
Stay away from me!

766
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:13,370
There, now.

767
01:06:14,622 --> 01:06:15,957
All better.

768
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:21,629
Everything's all right here.

769
01:06:23,631 --> 01:06:25,383
Watch your head.

770
01:06:54,787 --> 01:06:57,123
<i>John?</i>

771
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,126
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

772
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:16,769
Go easy now.

773
01:07:17,478 --> 01:07:19,856
<i>Thorazine takes a little while to wear off.</i>

774
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,945
<i>Sorry about the restraints.</i>

775
01:07:25,945 --> 01:07:28,073
You've got one hell of a right hook.

776
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:31,452
Where am I?

777
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:35,373
MacArthur Psychiatric Hospital.

778
01:07:38,543 --> 01:07:40,586
I find that highly unlikely.

779
01:07:41,588 --> 01:07:43,088
You made a mistake.

780
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:46,593
My work is non-military in application.

781
01:07:47,635 --> 01:07:49,345
Which work is that, John?

782
01:07:52,057 --> 01:07:53,475
I don't know anything.

783
01:07:54,434 --> 01:07:56,894
There's no good in keeping secrets,
you know.

784
01:08:12,786 --> 01:08:13,745
Charles?

785
01:08:16,038 --> 01:08:17,164
Charles?

786
01:08:19,457 --> 01:08:21,877
I didn't mean to get you involved in this.

787
01:08:23,088 --> 01:08:24,547
I'm sorry.

788
01:08:30,305 --> 01:08:31,680
Charles?

789
01:08:39,605 --> 01:08:41,774
The prodigal roommate revealed.

790
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,320
�Saw my name on the lecture slate�?

791
01:08:47,322 --> 01:08:49,448
You lying son of a bitch!

792
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,077
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

793
01:08:52,411 --> 01:08:54,704
How do you say
�Charles Herman� in Russian?

794
01:08:54,954 --> 01:08:57,122
How do you say it in Russian?

795
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:00,252
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

796
01:09:00,335 --> 01:09:03,505
He's right there. He's right there.

797
01:09:04,381 --> 01:09:06,216
Stop! I don't know anything!

798
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:09,051
Stop! I don't know anything!

799
01:09:11,012 --> 01:09:12,722
My name is John Nash.

800
01:09:12,847 --> 01:09:14,850
I'm being held against my will.

801
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,394
Somebody call the Department of Defense.

802
01:09:17,644 --> 01:09:19,605
My name is John Nash.

803
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:21,648
I'm being held against my will!

804
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:29,405
What's wrong with him?

805
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:33,911
John has schizophrenia.

806
01:09:35,368 --> 01:09:38,081
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

807
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,378
But his work.

808
01:09:43,837 --> 01:09:45,797
He deals with conspiracy.

809
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:49,135
Yes, I know.

810
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:53,389
In John's world,
these behaviors are accepted...

811
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:54,724
...encouraged.

812
01:09:55,516 --> 01:09:58,603
As such,
his illness may have gone untreated...

813
01:09:58,685 --> 01:10:00,438
...far longer than is typical.

814
01:10:01,648 --> 01:10:03,232
What do you mean? How long?

815
01:10:03,316 --> 01:10:05,068
Possibly since graduate school.

816
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:08,321
At least that's when his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

817
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,823
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?

818
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:13,117
One, so far, that I am aware of.

819
01:10:13,826 --> 01:10:16,828
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

820
01:10:18,122 --> 01:10:20,166
Charles isn't imaginary.

821
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,460
They have been best friends
since Princeton.

822
01:10:22,543 --> 01:10:25,630
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

823
01:10:26,339 --> 01:10:29,092
He's always in town
for so little time, lecturing.

824
01:10:29,217 --> 01:10:31,803
- Was he at your wedding?
- He had to teach.

825
01:10:31,886 --> 01:10:34,681
Have you seen a picture,
or talked to him on the phone?

826
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:36,016
This is ridiculous.

827
01:10:36,558 --> 01:10:37,810
I phoned Princeton.

828
01:10:39,019 --> 01:10:42,022
According to their housing records,
John lived alone.

829
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:48,697
Now, which is more likely?
That your husband...

830
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:51,199
...a mathematician
with no military training...

831
01:10:51,324 --> 01:10:55,120
...is a spy fleeing the Russians...
- You're making him sound crazy.

832
01:10:55,203 --> 01:10:58,123
Or, that he has lost his grip on reality?

833
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:04,296
The only way I can help him,
is to show him the difference...

834
01:11:04,629 --> 01:11:07,882
...between what is real
and what is in his mind.

835
01:11:12,013 --> 01:11:13,306
Come on.

836
01:11:15,683 --> 01:11:17,435
What's he been working on?

837
01:11:19,228 --> 01:11:20,770
His work is classified.

838
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,024
He mentioned a supervisor...

839
01:11:23,441 --> 01:11:25,401
...by the name of William Parcher.

840
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,237
Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things for us.

841
01:11:28,529 --> 01:11:30,948
<i>But I can't get to him without clearances.</i>

842
01:11:32,742 --> 01:11:35,912
You want me to help you get the details
of my husband's work?

843
01:11:37,497 --> 01:11:39,666
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.

844
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:41,543
Is that what you think?

845
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:48,717
- What did the doctor say?
- Is he sick?

846
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,885
I don't know.

847
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:52,095
I want to see
what John's been working on.

848
01:11:52,261 --> 01:11:55,057
- You can't go in his office.
- It's classified, Alicia.

849
01:11:55,182 --> 01:11:56,350
Stop.

850
01:12:10,907 --> 01:12:12,033
Oh, my God.

851
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:18,163
Oh, my God.

852
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:28,007
Why didn't you say something?

853
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:31,135
Alicia, John has always been...

854
01:12:31,386 --> 01:12:33,388
...a little weird.

855
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:36,140
He said he was doing code-breaking.

856
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:39,228
- It was eyes-only.
- Top-secret, part of the military effort.

857
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,479
Was he?

858
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,524
It was possible.

859
01:12:43,607 --> 01:12:46,735
Directives come down all the time
that some aren't cleared for.

860
01:12:46,819 --> 01:12:50,448
- It was possible.
- Possible, but not likely.

861
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:57,581
Lately, he'd become much more agitated,
and then when you called...

862
01:12:57,747 --> 01:13:00,417
So, is this all he's been doing every day?

863
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:03,377
Cutting up magazines?

864
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,008
Well, not all.

865
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:31,302
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

866
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:36,474
I missed you.

867
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:41,479
I have to talk to you.

868
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:43,439
Okay.

869
01:14:48,778 --> 01:14:50,947
Alicia, I've been thinking about it...

870
01:14:51,364 --> 01:14:54,325
...and I do realize that my behavior...

871
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:57,787
...and my inability
to discuss the situation with you...

872
01:14:58,329 --> 01:15:00,373
...must have appeared insane.

873
01:15:00,832 --> 01:15:02,750
I left you with no other choice.

874
01:15:03,501 --> 01:15:05,170
I do understand...

875
01:15:05,546 --> 01:15:08,215
...and I'm truly sorry.
- That's okay.

876
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:11,343
Everything will be all right.

877
01:15:13,304 --> 01:15:14,972
Everything will be all right.

878
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:18,393
We just have to talk quietly.

879
01:15:19,603 --> 01:15:23,023
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

880
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,027
I'll tell you everything now.

881
01:15:27,111 --> 01:15:30,698
It's breaking with protocol,
but you need to know...

882
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:34,535
...because you have to help me
get out of here.

883
01:15:36,494 --> 01:15:39,332
I've been doing top-secret work
for the government.

884
01:15:39,582 --> 01:15:41,292
There's a threat that exists...

885
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:43,794
...of catastrophic proportions.

886
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:47,798
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.

887
01:15:47,882 --> 01:15:49,926
That's why they won't do away with me.

888
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:53,387
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me from doing my work.

889
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:55,014
You have to get to Wheeler.

890
01:15:55,222 --> 01:15:58,100
- You have to find William Parcher.
- Stop.

891
01:15:58,184 --> 01:15:59,353
Stop!

892
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,234
I went to Wheeler.

893
01:16:06,985 --> 01:16:08,195
Good, good.

894
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,322
There is no William Parcher.

895
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,825
Of course there is.
I've been working for him.

896
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:16,619
Doing what? Breaking codes?

897
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:21,291
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox
for the government to pick up?

898
01:16:22,918 --> 01:16:24,336
How could you know that?

899
01:16:24,544 --> 01:16:25,878
Sol followed you.

900
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:30,759
- He thought it was harmless.
- Sol followed me?

901
01:16:39,602 --> 01:16:41,436
They've never been opened.

902
01:16:44,565 --> 01:16:46,359
It isn't real.

903
01:16:47,694 --> 01:16:49,737
<i>There is no conspiracy, John.</i>

904
01:16:53,074 --> 01:16:55,201
<i>There is no William Parcher.</i>

905
01:16:56,619 --> 01:16:58,162
<i>It's in your mind.</i>

906
01:17:00,873 --> 01:17:03,418
Do you understand, baby?

907
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:06,503
You're sick.

908
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,718
<i>You're sick, John.</i>

909
01:17:12,343 --> 01:17:13,553
John?

910
01:17:14,304 --> 01:17:16,180
John!

911
01:17:24,481 --> 01:17:25,566
Code red.

912
01:17:25,733 --> 01:17:28,444
<i>Dr. Rosen, code red.</i>
<i>Observation Room 2.</i>

913
01:17:29,069 --> 01:17:31,989
<i>Dr. Rosen, code red. Observation Room 2.</i>

914
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:44,595
John?

915
01:17:47,557 --> 01:17:48,767
John?

916
01:17:51,186 --> 01:17:52,437
The implant is gone.

917
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:55,857
I can't find it.

918
01:18:00,403 --> 01:18:01,528
It's gone.

919
01:18:33,311 --> 01:18:36,064
You see,
the nightmare of schizophrenia...

920
01:18:36,523 --> 01:18:38,608
<i>...is not knowing what's true.</i>

921
01:18:39,985 --> 01:18:41,443
<i>Imagine...</i>

922
01:18:41,695 --> 01:18:44,823
<i>...if you had suddenly learned</i>
<i>that the people and the places...</i>

923
01:18:44,948 --> 01:18:50,327
<i>...and the moments most important to you</i>
<i>were not gone, not dead...</i>

924
01:18:50,787 --> 01:18:53,958
<i>...but worse, had never been.</i>

925
01:18:57,711 --> 01:18:59,630
What kind of hell would that be?

926
01:19:05,845 --> 01:19:07,680
Administering insulin.

927
01:19:08,514 --> 01:19:10,182
8:42 a.m.

928
01:20:08,702 --> 01:20:09,954
How often?

929
01:20:12,206 --> 01:20:14,792
Five times a week for 10 weeks.

930
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,149
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY - 1 YEAR LATER

931
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:41,361
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

932
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,072
<i>Hansen is running the department now.</i>

933
01:20:44,322 --> 01:20:46,992
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

934
01:20:48,201 --> 01:20:49,494
Yeah.

935
01:20:49,577 --> 01:20:53,290
John won't come near the campus, though.
I think he's ashamed.

936
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:57,376
Hey. Hey.

937
01:20:57,961 --> 01:20:59,296
<i>Want this?</i>

938
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:03,508
So, Alicia, how are you holding up?

939
01:21:05,135 --> 01:21:06,594
The delusions have passed.

940
01:21:07,012 --> 01:21:10,807
They're saying with the medication
and low stress environment...

941
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:13,936
I mean, how are you?

942
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:23,028
I think often what I feel...

943
01:21:24,405 --> 01:21:26,157
...is obligation.

944
01:21:28,743 --> 01:21:31,202
Or guilt over wanting to leave.

945
01:21:33,623 --> 01:21:37,001
Rage against John, against God, and...

946
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:41,296
But...

947
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,844
...then I look at him...

948
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:50,390
...and I force myself to see the man
that I married.

949
01:21:52,726 --> 01:21:54,269
And he becomes that man.

950
01:21:54,853 --> 01:21:58,523
He's transformed into someone that I love.

951
01:22:01,902 --> 01:22:04,363
And I'm transformed into someone
who loves him.

952
01:22:08,241 --> 01:22:10,077
It's not all the time, but...

953
01:22:12,621 --> 01:22:14,039
...it's enough.

954
01:22:15,415 --> 01:22:19,001
I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia.

955
01:22:24,509 --> 01:22:26,219
So unlucky.

956
01:22:29,764 --> 01:22:31,557
- This is us.
- This is it?

957
01:22:31,641 --> 01:22:33,476
It's near where I work.

958
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,562
John?
You have a visitor.

959
01:22:39,983 --> 01:22:40,858
Hi.

960
01:22:43,903 --> 01:22:45,863
I hope it's okay.

961
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,206
Hey, chief.

962
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:58,168
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

963
01:22:58,419 --> 01:22:59,878
I quit, actually.

964
01:23:04,341 --> 01:23:05,718
- Hello.
- Hey, John.

965
01:23:08,637 --> 01:23:10,139
Have you met Harvey?

966
01:23:13,559 --> 01:23:15,269
- There's no...
- Relax, it's okay.

967
01:23:15,352 --> 01:23:18,272
There's no point being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.

968
01:23:18,354 --> 01:23:21,108
Jesus Christ.
I should have known.

969
01:23:23,485 --> 01:23:24,486
Here you go.

970
01:23:26,697 --> 01:23:30,201
- I can take those later.
- You're supposed to take them now.

971
01:23:31,579 --> 01:23:33,664
- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.

972
01:23:35,082 --> 01:23:36,125
Okay.

973
01:23:39,629 --> 01:23:43,758
So, I was in town giving a workshop.

974
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:45,801
<i>I go back tonight.</i>

975
01:23:46,177 --> 01:23:49,347
Bender really wanted to stop by...

976
01:23:49,972 --> 01:23:52,850
<i>...you know, see you. Say hi.</i>

977
01:23:53,142 --> 01:23:54,268
Squeamish?

978
01:23:55,019 --> 01:23:56,019
Yeah.

979
01:23:57,604 --> 01:23:59,190
I suppose I would be, too.

980
01:23:59,733 --> 01:24:01,735
But, alas, I'm stuck with me.

981
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,741
I'm trying to solve the Riemann hypothesis.

982
01:24:07,824 --> 01:24:08,951
Uh-huh.

983
01:24:09,952 --> 01:24:11,370
Oh, yeah?

984
01:24:12,204 --> 01:24:15,332
I figured if I dazzle them...

985
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,334
...they will have to reinstate me.

986
01:24:19,294 --> 01:24:22,296
But it's difficult with the medication...

987
01:24:22,506 --> 01:24:25,467
...because it's hard...

988
01:24:28,595 --> 01:24:30,805
...to see the solution.

989
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:40,732
You know, John, you should go easy.

990
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:45,572
There are other things besides work.

991
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:49,660
What are they?

992
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:27,948
What are you thinking about?

993
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,495
What do people do?

994
01:25:33,704 --> 01:25:35,706
It's life, John.

995
01:25:36,081 --> 01:25:39,209
Activities available, just add meaning.

996
01:25:48,177 --> 01:25:50,012
You could try leaving the house.

997
01:25:50,764 --> 01:25:52,349
You know, maybe...

998
01:25:53,767 --> 01:25:55,435
...talk to people.

999
01:26:00,315 --> 01:26:02,359
You could try taking out the garbage.

1000
01:26:24,761 --> 01:26:28,098
And there's some more,
there's some more in...

1001
01:26:39,943 --> 01:26:42,237
Who were you talking to?

1002
01:26:43,488 --> 01:26:44,822
Garbage man.

1003
01:26:53,915 --> 01:26:55,666
Garbage men don't come at night.

1004
01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:01,048
I guess around here they do.

1005
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:28,451
Sorry.

1006
01:28:35,689 --> 01:28:37,273
Is it the medication?

1007
01:29:18,858 --> 01:29:20,944
I don't know what to do.

1008
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:42,257
My mother's going to
keep the baby a little longer tonight.

1009
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:45,302
<i>I can get three hours of overtime.</i>

1010
01:30:11,536 --> 01:30:12,913
I'm going to bed.

1011
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:22,005
- Good night.
- Good night.

1012
01:31:41,636 --> 01:31:43,346
It's good to see you, John.

1013
01:31:44,972 --> 01:31:46,307
<i>It's been a while.</i>

1014
01:31:47,558 --> 01:31:48,601
Parcher?

1015
01:31:49,685 --> 01:31:50,770
Yes, sir.

1016
01:31:54,190 --> 01:31:55,358
You're not real!

1017
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,444
Of course I am. Don't be ridiculous.

1018
01:32:03,282 --> 01:32:05,618
I don't think that I would go that way.

1019
01:32:07,036 --> 01:32:09,580
It's time for you
to get back to work.

1020
01:32:10,081 --> 01:32:13,209
<i>The bomb is in its final position</i>
<i>here in the U.S.</i>

1021
01:32:15,335 --> 01:32:19,716
<i>Knowing your situation requires you keep</i>
<i>a low profile, "Mohammed"...</i>

1022
01:32:21,218 --> 01:32:23,595
...we've brought the mountain to you.

1023
01:32:42,155 --> 01:32:46,952
We've narrowed the bomb's location
to somewhere on the eastern seaboard.

1024
01:32:48,371 --> 01:32:51,624
<i>But we haven't been able to pinpoint</i>
<i>its exact position.</i>

1025
01:32:53,876 --> 01:32:57,046
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1026
01:32:59,717 --> 01:33:01,135
Look at this, John.

1027
01:33:04,097 --> 01:33:04,889
What?

1028
01:33:06,474 --> 01:33:07,642
What?

1029
01:33:10,144 --> 01:33:12,939
- Dr. Rosen said...
- Rosen! That quack!

1030
01:33:14,024 --> 01:33:17,652
�Schizophrenic break from reality,� right?
Psychological bullshit!

1031
01:33:17,986 --> 01:33:19,362
Look at me, John.

1032
01:33:20,488 --> 01:33:22,157
<i>John, look at me.</i>

1033
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,036
Do I look like I'm imagined?

1034
01:33:28,412 --> 01:33:30,247
Wheeler has no record of you.

1035
01:33:30,497 --> 01:33:32,710
Do you think we list our personnel?

1036
01:33:35,129 --> 01:33:37,923
I'm sorry you had to
go through all this.

1037
01:33:38,924 --> 01:33:41,844
<i>I've gone to a great deal of trouble</i>
<i>to get you back.</i>

1038
01:33:41,969 --> 01:33:44,138
I can restore your status at Wheeler.

1039
01:33:44,347 --> 01:33:47,016
I can let the world know what you did.

1040
01:33:47,558 --> 01:33:49,226
But I need you now, soldier.

1041
01:33:56,068 --> 01:33:58,153
I was so scared you weren't real.

1042
01:33:59,696 --> 01:34:01,782
Princeton, New Jersey - April 1956

1043
01:34:06,452 --> 01:34:08,162
There's a storm coming.

1044
01:34:08,455 --> 01:34:10,666
I'm just going to grab the laundry.

1045
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:12,793
I'll draw his bath.

1046
01:34:16,505 --> 01:34:17,589
It's okay.

1047
01:34:19,299 --> 01:34:20,258
Okay.

1048
01:35:59,653 --> 01:36:01,028
John!

1049
01:36:07,619 --> 01:36:10,705
I've almost got it!
Charles, you just watch the baby.

1050
01:36:11,372 --> 01:36:12,707
No!

1051
01:36:19,048 --> 01:36:21,759
I need a towel.

1052
01:36:24,345 --> 01:36:27,473
- Charles was watching him. He was okay.
- There is no one here.

1053
01:36:29,266 --> 01:36:30,601
There is no one here!

1054
01:36:30,685 --> 01:36:32,812
He's been injected with a cloaking serum.

1055
01:36:32,894 --> 01:36:36,732
<i>I can see him because of a chemical</i>
<i>that was released into my bloodstream...</i>

1056
01:36:36,899 --> 01:36:38,401
...when my implant dissolved.

1057
01:36:40,444 --> 01:36:43,488
I couldn't tell you,
it was for your own protection!

1058
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:46,283
Alicia!

1059
01:36:51,206 --> 01:36:54,418
- No!
- Hello, I need Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1060
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:56,461
You've got to stop her, John.

1061
01:36:58,005 --> 01:37:00,215
You leave her out of this.

1062
01:37:01,675 --> 01:37:04,386
- Who are you talking to?
- It's not her fault.

1063
01:37:04,886 --> 01:37:07,346
- She'll compromise us again.
- She won't.

1064
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:09,181
You'll go back to the hospital.

1065
01:37:09,266 --> 01:37:11,351
- Answer me!
- Countless people will die.

1066
01:37:11,435 --> 01:37:13,228
Alicia, please put the phone down.

1067
01:37:13,311 --> 01:37:15,689
- I can't let that happen.
- Yes, hello?

1068
01:37:15,772 --> 01:37:17,983
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen. Is he in?

1069
01:37:18,942 --> 01:37:21,403
I'm sorry, John.

1070
01:37:22,112 --> 01:37:23,281
No!

1071
01:37:27,077 --> 01:37:29,955
- You know what you must do.
- Get away from me.

1072
01:37:30,038 --> 01:37:32,666
- She's too great a risk.
- Get away!

1073
01:37:33,417 --> 01:37:35,461
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1074
01:37:37,129 --> 01:37:40,049
Finish her. She knows too much now.

1075
01:37:43,594 --> 01:37:45,304
Uncle John?

1076
01:37:45,386 --> 01:37:49,391
Take care of her, you pathetic
piece of shit, or I'll take care of you.

1077
01:37:50,225 --> 01:37:52,853
Christ, John,
please do what he says.

1078
01:37:53,103 --> 01:37:55,649
Move, soldier.

1079
01:37:55,815 --> 01:37:57,067
<i>Now.</i>

1080
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:58,318
Uncle John?

1081
01:37:59,277 --> 01:38:01,237
John, please!

1082
01:38:02,364 --> 01:38:03,948
Now!

1083
01:38:04,074 --> 01:38:08,162
<i>Alicia and Charles never</i>
<i>coexist in the same interactive field.</i>

1084
01:38:08,245 --> 01:38:09,622
<i>Parcher and Charles...</i>

1085
01:38:11,791 --> 01:38:14,877
<i>Charles and Marcee</i>
<i>cannot coexist with Alicia.</i>

1086
01:38:20,299 --> 01:38:21,300
<i>I understand.</i>

1087
01:38:38,735 --> 01:38:40,696
She never gets old.

1088
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:46,451
Marcee can't be real. She never gets old.

1089
01:39:20,027 --> 01:39:21,653
You see them now?

1090
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:32,581
Yes.

1091
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:36,376
Why did you stop your meds?

1092
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:41,424
Because I couldn't do my work.

1093
01:39:41,507 --> 01:39:43,385
I couldn't help with the baby.

1094
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:45,220
I couldn't...

1095
01:39:46,764 --> 01:39:48,974
I couldn't respond to my wife.

1096
01:39:51,769 --> 01:39:54,064
You think that's better than being crazy?

1097
01:39:54,147 --> 01:39:58,526
We'll need to start you on a higher run
of insulin shocks and a new medication.

1098
01:39:58,651 --> 01:40:00,278
No.

1099
01:40:01,112 --> 01:40:04,616
- There has to be another way.
- Schizophrenia is degenerative.

1100
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:08,495
Some days may be symptom-free,
but over time, you are getting worse.

1101
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:11,623
It's a problem. That's all it is.

1102
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:16,503
It's a problem with no solution.
And that's what I do, I solve problems.

1103
01:40:16,586 --> 01:40:18,212
This isn't math.

1104
01:40:18,296 --> 01:40:21,383
<i>You can't come up with a formula to</i>
<i>change the way you experience the world.</i>

1105
01:40:21,508 --> 01:40:24,844
- All I have to do is apply my mind.
<i>- There's no theorem, no proof.</i>

1106
01:40:24,969 --> 01:40:27,346
- You can't reason your way out of this.
- Why not?

1107
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:30,600
Because your mind is where the problem is
in the first place.

1108
01:40:32,435 --> 01:40:34,645
I can do this.

1109
01:40:35,313 --> 01:40:38,065
I can work it out. All I need is time.

1110
01:40:41,987 --> 01:40:43,779
Is that the baby?

1111
01:40:45,824 --> 01:40:47,867
The baby is at my mother's, John.

1112
01:41:01,716 --> 01:41:03,843
Without treatment, John...

1113
01:41:04,802 --> 01:41:06,929
<i>...the fantasies may take over...</i>

1114
01:41:07,763 --> 01:41:09,306
...entirely.

1115
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:28,993
You almost ready?

1116
01:41:31,412 --> 01:41:33,706
Rosen's waiting outside.

1117
01:41:34,415 --> 01:41:37,084
I can't go back to that hospital.

1118
01:41:40,629 --> 01:41:42,672
I won't come home.

1119
01:41:46,427 --> 01:41:48,636
He said that if you said that...

1120
01:41:49,471 --> 01:41:52,559
...he has commitment papers
for me to sign.

1121
01:41:55,312 --> 01:41:57,355
Well, maybe you won't sign them.

1122
01:41:58,774 --> 01:42:00,984
<i>Maybe you'll just give me some time.</i>

1123
01:42:03,821 --> 01:42:05,782
I will try to figure this out.

1124
01:42:08,117 --> 01:42:09,994
<i>Whatever you do...</i>

1125
01:42:10,745 --> 01:42:12,955
<i>...Rosen is right about one thing.</i>

1126
01:42:14,082 --> 01:42:16,584
You shouldn't be here.

1127
01:42:18,545 --> 01:42:20,422
I'm not safe anymore.

1128
01:42:26,053 --> 01:42:28,013
Would you have hurt me, John?

1129
01:42:37,564 --> 01:42:39,190
I don't know.

1130
01:42:40,067 --> 01:42:43,404
<i>Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen</i>
<i>drive you to your mother's.</i>

1131
01:43:04,008 --> 01:43:05,968
He told me to leave.

1132
01:43:13,194 --> 01:43:14,320
I understand.

1133
01:43:49,898 --> 01:43:53,360
Rosen said to call if you try and kill me,
or anything.

1134
01:44:10,379 --> 01:44:12,630
You want to know what's real?

1135
01:44:17,552 --> 01:44:19,429
<i>This.</i>

1136
01:44:26,813 --> 01:44:28,356
This.

1137
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:35,321
This.

1138
01:44:37,615 --> 01:44:39,409
This is real.

1139
01:44:42,745 --> 01:44:44,455
Maybe the part...

1140
01:44:44,914 --> 01:44:47,458
...that knows the waking from the dream...

1141
01:44:48,668 --> 01:44:50,545
...maybe it isn't here.

1142
01:44:54,507 --> 01:44:56,926
Maybe it's here.

1143
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:04,308
I need to believe...

1144
01:45:04,434 --> 01:45:07,437
...that something extraordinary is possible.

1145
01:45:54,068 --> 01:45:59,490
Princeton University - Two Months Later

1146
01:46:10,584 --> 01:46:12,294
Come.

1147
01:46:21,137 --> 01:46:22,931
Hello, Martin.

1148
01:46:28,103 --> 01:46:29,312
Jesus Christ.

1149
01:46:31,063 --> 01:46:32,649
No. I...

1150
01:46:33,733 --> 01:46:38,154
I don't have that one. My savior complex
takes on a completely different form.

1151
01:46:39,657 --> 01:46:41,827
I heard what happened and...

1152
01:46:41,952 --> 01:46:44,663
...I wanted to write,
and I tried you at MacArthur's...

1153
01:46:44,788 --> 01:46:46,915
...but you'd left, and I just...

1154
01:46:59,177 --> 01:47:00,929
This is Helinger's old office.

1155
01:47:01,346 --> 01:47:02,889
Yeah.

1156
01:47:03,056 --> 01:47:05,517
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1157
01:47:07,978 --> 01:47:10,438
Seems that you won after all, Martin.

1158
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,484
They were wrong, John. No one wins.

1159
01:47:14,985 --> 01:47:17,070
Please, have a seat.

1160
01:47:17,987 --> 01:47:20,240
God, it's so good to see you.

1161
01:47:22,951 --> 01:47:25,078
<i>What brings you back to Princeton?</i>

1162
01:47:25,412 --> 01:47:26,790
John?

1163
01:47:26,957 --> 01:47:29,293
John, I'm sorry, but you have to tell him.

1164
01:47:29,376 --> 01:47:31,628
<i>Tell him you're a genius. You're a genius!</i>

1165
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:34,381
Tell him your work is critical.
John, please!

1166
01:47:49,397 --> 01:47:52,734
Is there any chance
that you could ignore what I just did?

1167
01:47:54,611 --> 01:47:56,946
Of course, what are old friends for?

1168
01:47:58,823 --> 01:48:01,201
Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?

1169
01:48:01,493 --> 01:48:03,578
John, of course.

1170
01:48:04,162 --> 01:48:06,540
Of course. We always have been.

1171
01:48:11,420 --> 01:48:13,339
Alicia and I think...

1172
01:48:14,006 --> 01:48:16,802
...that fitting in,
being part of a community...

1173
01:48:20,055 --> 01:48:21,598
...might do me some good.

1174
01:48:21,681 --> 01:48:25,686
That a certain level of attachment,
familiar places, familiar people...

1175
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:28,522
...might help me...

1176
01:48:29,230 --> 01:48:31,733
...elbow out...

1177
01:48:34,237 --> 01:48:36,948
...these certain delusions that I have.

1178
01:48:42,495 --> 01:48:45,123
It's a lot to ask, and now that I'm here...

1179
01:48:47,208 --> 01:48:49,961
...I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.

1180
01:48:52,922 --> 01:48:55,717
But I was wondering if I could hang around.

1181
01:49:04,435 --> 01:49:05,894
Huh.

1182
01:49:09,898 --> 01:49:12,067
Will you be needing an office?

1183
01:49:16,404 --> 01:49:17,739
No.

1184
01:49:20,826 --> 01:49:23,078
No, I could just work out of the library.

1185
01:49:23,662 --> 01:49:26,040
This guy tries to wander into
the library...

1186
01:49:26,123 --> 01:49:29,126
- But he has no ID.
- Why can't people read memos?

1187
01:49:29,209 --> 01:49:31,003
Then he goes totally nuts.

1188
01:49:31,086 --> 01:49:34,006
You're not real! You're not real.

1189
01:49:34,089 --> 01:49:35,257
<i>There's no mission.</i>

1190
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:37,968
Oh, shit. Shit.

1191
01:49:39,053 --> 01:49:41,513
You're not real! You are not real!

1192
01:49:41,805 --> 01:49:44,850
Is this what you are, soldier?
Some useless ghoul?

1193
01:49:45,017 --> 01:49:46,935
The local madman?

1194
01:49:47,019 --> 01:49:49,772
- I'm not a soldier.
- You'll end up in a cell!

1195
01:49:49,855 --> 01:49:51,774
Old, worthless, discarded.

1196
01:49:51,857 --> 01:49:53,067
There's no mission.

1197
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:56,487
While you rock and drool,
the world will burn to ashes!

1198
01:49:56,570 --> 01:49:58,906
You are not real! You are not real!

1199
01:49:58,989 --> 01:50:01,033
You're still talking to me, soldier.

1200
01:50:01,116 --> 01:50:04,286
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1201
01:50:04,411 --> 01:50:06,080
John? John?

1202
01:50:09,417 --> 01:50:11,252
John! It's okay.

1203
01:50:11,336 --> 01:50:13,296
I just heard what happened, I'm sorry.

1204
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:15,297
- I'm not a soldier.
- John. Hey, Nash.

1205
01:50:15,382 --> 01:50:17,884
Nash, hey. You're all right.

1206
01:50:20,970 --> 01:50:22,596
Nash, hey.

1207
01:50:26,685 --> 01:50:29,355
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1208
01:50:29,438 --> 01:50:30,690
John?

1209
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:35,027
<i>You should've seen their faces.</i>

1210
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,280
Everybody was just staring at me.

1211
01:50:38,364 --> 01:50:42,660
John, you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1212
01:50:43,828 --> 01:50:45,496
I know.

1213
01:50:47,999 --> 01:50:50,085
But then, on the way home...

1214
01:50:50,627 --> 01:50:53,004
<i>...Charles was there.</i>

1215
01:50:56,883 --> 01:50:59,386
Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.

1216
01:51:02,931 --> 01:51:04,599
<i>Maybe Rosen's right.</i>

1217
01:51:05,893 --> 01:51:09,439
Maybe I have to think about going back
into the hospital again.

1218
01:51:09,521 --> 01:51:11,941
No. Come here.

1219
01:51:16,822 --> 01:51:18,615
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1220
01:51:43,432 --> 01:51:46,226
John, now you can't ignore me forever.

1221
01:51:52,191 --> 01:51:54,902
You've been a very good friend to me.

1222
01:51:55,069 --> 01:51:56,320
<i>The best.</i>

1223
01:51:58,364 --> 01:52:00,365
But I won't talk to you again.

1224
01:52:04,078 --> 01:52:05,412
I just can't.

1225
01:52:11,752 --> 01:52:13,713
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1226
01:52:22,138 --> 01:52:23,181
Good-bye.

1227
01:52:30,481 --> 01:52:31,731
Good-bye.

1228
01:52:46,539 --> 01:52:49,208
I was wondering
if I might audit your course.

1229
01:52:50,543 --> 01:52:53,003
It's an honor, Professor Nash.

1230
01:52:56,423 --> 01:52:57,925
Is something wrong?

1231
01:53:00,010 --> 01:53:01,930
This will be my first class.

1232
01:53:05,642 --> 01:53:06,977
Good morning...

1233
01:53:08,103 --> 01:53:09,688
...eager young minds.

1234
01:53:30,293 --> 01:53:32,211
It's never going to work, John.

1235
01:53:32,962 --> 01:53:35,131
You're just humiliating yourself.

1236
01:53:37,676 --> 01:53:38,927
It's pathetic!

1237
01:53:39,928 --> 01:53:41,597
You are being pathetic.

1238
01:53:42,056 --> 01:53:43,640
I'm ashamed of you!

1239
01:54:11,418 --> 01:54:13,128
Oh, man!

1240
01:54:17,173 --> 01:54:19,843
Are you coming?
You're going to be late.

1241
01:54:22,805 --> 01:54:24,847
- Dad, you've got my book.
- What?

1242
01:54:25,224 --> 01:54:28,227
- You've got my book.
- Oh, right.

1243
01:54:28,811 --> 01:54:29,853
Thanks.

1244
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:32,564
- Good-bye.
- 'Bye.

1245
01:54:32,981 --> 01:54:34,358
See you tonight.

1246
01:54:35,234 --> 01:54:36,443
'Bye, honey.

1247
01:55:56,783 --> 01:55:59,369
Princeton University - October 1978

1248
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:11,297
Did you just solve Riemann?

1249
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:13,299
Well, what do you think?

1250
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:18,304
That's an analog to Frobenius
for noncommutative extensions.

1251
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:21,016
Yes, it is.

1252
01:56:22,267 --> 01:56:25,020
But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.

1253
01:56:25,061 --> 01:56:26,230
But...

1254
01:56:26,772 --> 01:56:28,982
...I believe I'm making progress.

1255
01:56:31,025 --> 01:56:32,985
You're...

1256
01:56:33,153 --> 01:56:35,531
You're John Nash, right?

1257
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:39,993
- Toby Kelly.
- Hello.

1258
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:43,747
I've been studying your equilibrium
that you wrote here at Princeton.

1259
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:46,917
<i>To come up with something</i>
<i>totally original, the way you did...</i>

1260
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,668
You know, I was young.

1261
01:56:50,087 --> 01:56:52,214
I've been developing a theory.

1262
01:57:06,855 --> 01:57:08,565
I believe I can prove...

1263
01:57:08,898 --> 01:57:11,484
...that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1264
01:57:11,568 --> 01:57:16,239
That everything is connected.
That it's all part of the same subject.

1265
01:57:17,699 --> 01:57:19,743
When was the last time you ate?

1266
01:57:19,826 --> 01:57:22,369
- Excuse me?
- You know, food.

1267
01:57:22,494 --> 01:57:24,456
Oh, uh...

1268
01:57:24,622 --> 01:57:25,790
My wife...

1269
01:57:26,624 --> 01:57:28,335
...she loves mayonnaise.

1270
01:57:30,838 --> 01:57:32,006
Thank you.

1271
01:57:34,216 --> 01:57:35,301
Go on.

1272
01:57:35,926 --> 01:57:37,302
The functor...

1273
01:57:38,304 --> 01:57:40,222
...is in the two categories.

1274
01:57:44,851 --> 01:57:45,895
Alicia!

1275
01:57:47,271 --> 01:57:48,314
Alicia!

1276
01:57:48,856 --> 01:57:51,233
Coming together
at a maximum speed of...

1277
01:57:52,234 --> 01:57:54,153
<i>...let us say, 10 miles per hour.</i>

1278
01:57:54,235 --> 01:57:56,947
<i>So you have a fly</i>
<i>on the tire of bicycle "B"...</i>

1279
01:57:57,323 --> 01:58:00,367
<i>...and the fly,</i>
<i>who can travel at 20 miles an hour...</i>

1280
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:03,621
...leaves the tire of �B�
and flies to the tire of bicycle �A�...

1281
01:58:03,704 --> 01:58:06,916
...and backwards and forwards
until the two bikes collide...

1282
01:58:06,999 --> 01:58:09,418
...and the poor little fly is squashed.

1283
01:58:09,793 --> 01:58:13,590
<i>This is the important thing about</i>
<i>actually focusing in and comprehending...</i>

1284
01:58:13,673 --> 01:58:16,802
<i>...the area you're dealing with.</i>
<i>Mathematics is very specific...</i>

1285
01:58:16,885 --> 01:58:20,347
...and it is an art form,
no matter what people here will tell you...

1286
01:58:20,430 --> 01:58:23,767
...especially people from biology.
Don't listen to those people.

1287
01:58:23,850 --> 01:58:27,188
<i>Let me go back to what you were doing.</i>
<i>I might want to steal this...</i>

1288
01:58:27,271 --> 01:58:29,107
<i>...write a book and get famous.</i>

1289
01:58:30,441 --> 01:58:32,610
I was thinking that I might teach.

1290
01:58:34,487 --> 01:58:37,907
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

1291
01:58:39,158 --> 01:58:41,994
John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.

1292
01:58:43,496 --> 01:58:45,498
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1293
01:58:46,708 --> 01:58:49,961
I was hoping there still might be
something I could contribute.

1294
01:58:50,043 --> 01:58:51,503
What about the...

1295
01:58:52,213 --> 01:58:53,548
Well, you know.

1296
01:58:54,048 --> 01:58:55,425
Are they gone?

1297
01:59:02,265 --> 01:59:04,392
No, they're not gone.

1298
01:59:04,851 --> 01:59:06,686
And maybe they never will be.

1299
01:59:06,769 --> 01:59:10,940
But I've gotten used to ignoring them,
and I think they've given up on me.

1300
01:59:12,483 --> 01:59:17,155
You think that's what it's like with
all our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?

1301
01:59:17,947 --> 01:59:21,117
You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?

1302
01:59:21,242 --> 01:59:23,494
John, they haunt you though.

1303
01:59:25,079 --> 01:59:28,459
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.

1304
01:59:32,337 --> 01:59:33,839
Well, good-bye.

1305
01:59:34,214 --> 01:59:36,383
John, I'll talk to the department.

1306
01:59:38,635 --> 01:59:40,220
Maybe in the spring.

1307
01:59:46,019 --> 01:59:47,186
Hey, Nash.

1308
01:59:49,606 --> 01:59:51,900
You, uh...

1309
01:59:52,275 --> 01:59:53,485
You scared?

1310
01:59:56,155 --> 01:59:57,323
Terrified.

1311
01:59:58,032 --> 02:00:00,409
Mortified. Petrified.

1312
02:00:00,618 --> 02:00:02,286
Stupefied by you.

1313
02:00:02,869 --> 02:00:05,748
Now you ought best ring Alicia,
or you'll get me...

1314
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:07,917
- I'll ring her.
...in a lot of trouble.

1315
02:00:12,046 --> 02:00:13,589
- Thanks, Professor.
- Good-bye.

1316
02:00:13,672 --> 02:00:15,007
- Have a nice day.
- Good-bye.

1317
02:00:15,091 --> 02:00:16,634
Princeton University - March 1994

1318
02:00:16,717 --> 02:00:18,511
Papers in hand, Mr. Bayer.

1319
02:00:18,802 --> 02:00:20,137
Professor Nash?

1320
02:00:23,933 --> 02:00:26,686
- Can you see him?
- Yeah.

1321
02:00:26,770 --> 02:00:28,105
- You sure?
- Yes.

1322
02:00:28,188 --> 02:00:30,399
Positive? He's within your vision?

1323
02:00:30,982 --> 02:00:32,360
Okay. Good.

1324
02:00:32,485 --> 02:00:35,279
Forgive me,
I'm just always suspicious of new people.

1325
02:00:35,363 --> 02:00:38,199
- See you next week, Professor.
- See you next week.

1326
02:00:38,991 --> 02:00:43,246
So now that I know that you're real,
who are you, and what can I do for you?

1327
02:00:43,913 --> 02:00:46,416
Professor, my name is Thomas King.

1328
02:00:46,499 --> 02:00:47,625
Thomas King?

1329
02:00:47,708 --> 02:00:52,046
I'm here to tell you that you're being
considered for the Nobel Prize.

1330
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:02,640
Forgive me,
but I'm just a little stunned.

1331
02:01:02,724 --> 02:01:06,144
Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone...

1332
02:01:06,226 --> 02:01:07,895
...of modern economics.

1333
02:01:07,979 --> 02:01:10,148
Suddenly everybody likes that one.

1334
02:01:10,231 --> 02:01:14,485
What about my work on other some
such projects like manifold embedding?

1335
02:01:14,819 --> 02:01:18,156
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1336
02:01:18,406 --> 02:01:22,326
...to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1337
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:23,869
- Antitrust cases?
- Yes.

1338
02:01:23,953 --> 02:01:26,204
I never would have considered that.

1339
02:01:26,706 --> 02:01:31,168
Have I just reached some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1340
02:01:31,461 --> 02:01:35,048
- No, you haven't.
- I wouldn't have thought of that.

1341
02:01:40,427 --> 02:01:41,930
Shall we have tea?

1342
02:01:44,058 --> 02:01:48,145
I don't go in there.
I usually take my sandwich in the library.

1343
02:01:49,313 --> 02:01:52,357
Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1344
02:01:53,067 --> 02:01:58,531
Most commercially available brands of tea
are not suitable to my palate.

1345
02:01:58,615 --> 02:01:59,783
I'm not...

1346
02:02:00,158 --> 02:02:03,661
There are some Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough...

1347
02:02:03,744 --> 02:02:07,624
I enjoy the flavor that they have.
I have not been in this room...

1348
02:02:07,707 --> 02:02:10,793
...for quite some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1349
02:02:12,878 --> 02:02:14,672
Why, thank you, young lady.

1350
02:02:16,549 --> 02:02:20,427
Things have certainly changed around here.
I have a son that age.

1351
02:02:22,222 --> 02:02:23,306
Harvard.

1352
02:02:28,395 --> 02:02:29,229
Hmm.

1353
02:02:29,311 --> 02:02:34,525
I would have thought the nominations
for the Nobel Prize would've been secret.

1354
02:02:35,025 --> 02:02:38,488
I would have thought you'd only find out
if you won or lost.

1355
02:02:38,738 --> 02:02:42,659
That is generally the case, yes,
but these are special circumstances.

1356
02:02:44,284 --> 02:02:46,079
The awards are substantial.

1357
02:02:46,704 --> 02:02:49,791
They require private funding as such...

1358
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:53,337
...the image of the Nobel is...

1359
02:02:55,589 --> 02:02:58,426
I see, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1360
02:02:59,802 --> 02:03:03,472
Find out if I would screw everything up
if I actually won?

1361
02:03:05,474 --> 02:03:09,645
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk like a chicken?

1362
02:03:10,271 --> 02:03:12,022
Something like that, yes.

1363
02:03:13,649 --> 02:03:15,317
Would I embarrass you?

1364
02:03:19,405 --> 02:03:20,990
Yes, it is possible.

1365
02:03:24,368 --> 02:03:25,578
You see, I...

1366
02:03:27,413 --> 02:03:28,914
I am crazy.

1367
02:03:31,208 --> 02:03:33,336
I take the newer medications...

1368
02:03:37,007 --> 02:03:39,634
...but I still see things that are not here.

1369
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:44,598
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1370
02:03:46,558 --> 02:03:50,604
Like a diet of the mind,
I choose not to indulge certain appetites.

1371
02:03:53,440 --> 02:03:55,734
Like my appetite for patterns.

1372
02:03:57,694 --> 02:04:00,990
Perhaps my appetite to imagine
and to dream.

1373
02:04:02,450 --> 02:04:03,993
Professor Nash.

1374
02:04:09,123 --> 02:04:11,627
<i>It's good to have you here, John.</i>

1375
02:04:12,418 --> 02:04:13,503
Thank you.

1376
02:04:18,217 --> 02:04:21,679
- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you very much.

1377
02:04:22,764 --> 02:04:24,474
A privilege, Professor.

1378
02:04:28,895 --> 02:04:30,146
Professor.

1379
02:04:35,569 --> 02:04:38,322
- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.

1380
02:04:39,990 --> 02:04:41,075
Thank you.

1381
02:04:42,576 --> 02:04:43,744
Thank you.

1382
02:04:52,837 --> 02:04:54,171
Thank you, Ed.

1383
02:05:02,555 --> 02:05:04,724
That was certainly most unexpected.

1384
02:05:16,319 --> 02:05:18,447
Nobel Prize Ceremony - Stockholm, Sweden

1385
02:05:18,697 --> 02:05:21,074
December 1994

1386
02:05:26,704 --> 02:05:27,789
<i>Thank you.</i>

1387
02:05:32,627 --> 02:05:34,713
<i>I've always believed in numbers.</i>

1388
02:05:35,922 --> 02:05:39,092
<i>In the equations and logics</i>
<i>that lead to reason.</i>

1389
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:42,762
<i>But after a lifetime of such pursuits...</i>

1390
02:05:43,597 --> 02:05:46,975
<i>...I ask, what truly is logic?</i>

1391
02:05:48,726 --> 02:05:50,436
<i>Who decides reason?</i>

1392
02:05:52,272 --> 02:05:55,358
<i>My quest has taken me</i>
<i>through the physical...</i>

1393
02:05:56,275 --> 02:05:57,903
<i>...the metaphysical...</i>

1394
02:05:59,154 --> 02:06:00,697
<i>...the delusional...</i>

1395
02:06:02,866 --> 02:06:04,076
<i>...and back.</i>

1396
02:06:05,952 --> 02:06:09,289
<i>And I have made the most important</i>
<i>discovery of my career.</i>

1397
02:06:11,541 --> 02:06:14,043
<i>The most important discovery of my life.</i>

1398
02:06:17,339 --> 02:06:20,384
<i>It is only in the mysterious equations</i>
<i>of love...</i>

1399
02:06:21,177 --> 02:06:23,806
<i>...that any logical reasons can be found.</i>

1400
02:06:27,351 --> 02:06:29,895
<i>I'm only here tonight because of you.</i>

1401
02:06:31,855 --> 02:06:33,774
<i>You are the reason I am.</i>

1402
02:06:38,779 --> 02:06:40,656
<i>You are all my reasons.</i>

1403
02:06:45,244 --> 02:06:46,578
<i>Thank you.</i>

1404
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:42,761
So nice to have met you.

1405
02:07:45,847 --> 02:07:47,474
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1406
02:07:47,557 --> 02:07:49,768
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1407
02:07:51,144 --> 02:07:53,730
- Are you ready to go now?
- Yes, I am.

1408
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:56,066
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1409
02:07:56,524 --> 02:07:58,150
Thank you so much.

1410
02:07:59,527 --> 02:08:00,695
Thank you.

1411
02:08:03,406 --> 02:08:05,366
What is it? What's wrong?

1412
02:08:10,079 --> 02:08:11,247
Nothing.

1413
02:08:12,332 --> 02:08:13,583
Nothing at all.

1414
02:08:16,168 --> 02:08:18,546
- Come with me, young lady.
- Oh.

1415
02:08:19,464 --> 02:08:23,635
I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?

1416
02:08:25,220 --> 02:08:26,721
Where's it going to?

1417
02:08:26,805 --> 02:08:29,641
Nash's theories have influenced
global trade negotiations,

1418
02:08:29,724 --> 02:08:33,353
national labor relations and
even breakthroughs in evolutionary biology.

1419
