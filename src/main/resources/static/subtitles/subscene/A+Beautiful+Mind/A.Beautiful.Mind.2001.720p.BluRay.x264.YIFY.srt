-You're making him sound crazy.

Or, that he has lost his grip on reality?

01:57:47,134 --> 01:57:48,124
Alicia!

1389
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:50,997
JOHN: Coming together
at a maximum speed of...

1390
01:57:52,097 --> 01:57:53,932
...let us say, 10 miles per hour.

1391
01:57:54,099 --> 01:57:56,698
So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle "B"...

1392
01:57:57,185 --> 01:58:00,103
...and the fly,
who can travel at 20 miles an hour...

1393
01:58:00,313 --> 01:58:03,356
...leaves the tire of "B"
and flies to the tire of bicycle "A"...

1394
01:58:03,567 --> 01:58:06,644
...and backwards and forwards
until the two bikes collide...

1395
01:58:06,862 --> 01:58:09,175
...and the poor little fly is squashed.

1396
01:58:09,656 --> 01:58:13,292
This is the important thing about
actually focusing in and comprehending...

1397
01:58:13,535 --> 01:58:16,533
...the area you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific...

1398
01:58:16,747 --> 01:58:20,063
...and it is an art form,
no matter what people here will tell you...

1399
01:58:20,292 --> 01:58:23,495
...especially people from biology.
Don't listen to those people.

1400
01:58:23,712 --> 01:58:26,915
Let me go back to what you were doing.
I might want to steal this...

1401
01:58:27,133 --> 01:58:28,888
...write a book and get famous.

1402
01:58:30,303 --> 01:58:32,376
I was thinking that I might teach.

1403
01:58:34,349 --> 01:58:37,631
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.

1404
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:41,744
John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.

1405
01:58:43,358 --> 01:58:45,272
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1406
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:49,693
I was hoping there still might be
something I could contribute.

1407
01:58:49,906 --> 01:58:51,308
What about the....

1408
01:58:52,075 --> 01:58:53,352
Well, you know.

1409
01:58:53,911 --> 01:58:55,232
Are they gone?

1410
01:59:02,127 --> 01:59:04,168
No, they're not gone.

1411
01:59:04,713 --> 01:59:06,468
And maybe they never will be.

1412
01:59:06,632 --> 01:59:10,633
But I've gotten used to ignoring them,
and I think they've given up on me.

1413
01:59:12,346 --> 01:59:16,825
You think that's what it's like with
all our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?

1414
01:59:17,809 --> 01:59:20,852
You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?

1415
01:59:21,106 --> 01:59:23,260
MARTIN: John, they haunt you though.

1416
01:59:24,943 --> 01:59:28,180
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.

1417
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:33,636
JOHN: Well, good-bye.

1418
01:59:34,077 --> 01:59:36,151
MARTIN: John, I'll talk to the department.

1419
01:59:38,499 --> 01:59:40,014
Maybe in the spring.

1420
01:59:45,881 --> 01:59:46,997
Hey, Nash.

1421
01:59:49,468 --> 01:59:51,667
You, uh--

1422
01:59:52,137 --> 01:59:53,288
You scared?

1423
01:59:56,016 --> 01:59:57,133
Terrified.

1424
01:59:57,893 --> 02:00:00,173
Mortified. Petrified.

1425
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:02,074
Stupefied by you.

1426
02:00:02,732 --> 02:00:05,489
Now you ought best ring Alicia,
or you'll get me...

1427
02:00:05,692 --> 02:00:07,688
-I'll ring her.
-...in a lot of trouble.

1428
02:00:11,909 --> 02:00:13,389
-Thanks, Professor.
-Good-bye.

1429
02:00:13,535 --> 02:00:14,811
-Have a nice day.
-Good-bye.

-See you next week.

1439
02:00:38,852 --> 02:00:42,933
So now that I know that you're real,
who are you, and what can I do for you?

1440
02:00:43,774 --> 02:00:46,167
Professor, my name is Thomas King.

1441
02:00:46,361 --> 02:00:47,432
Thomas King?

1442
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:51,729
I'm here to tell you that you're being
considered for the Nobel Prize.

1443
02:01:00,291 --> 02:01:02,410
JOHN: Forgive me,
but I'm just a little stunned.

1444
02:01:02,585 --> 02:01:05,866
KING: Over the past years, your
equilibrium has become a cornerstone...

1445
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:07,685
...of modern economics.

1446
02:01:07,841 --> 02:01:09,914
Suddenly everybody likes that one.

1447
02:01:10,092 --> 02:01:14,173
What about my work on other some
such projects like manifold embedding?

1448
02:01:14,681 --> 02:01:17,883
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1449
02:01:18,268 --> 02:01:22,029
...to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases--

1450
02:01:22,273 --> 02:01:23,674
-Antitrust cases?
-Yes.

1451
02:01:23,815 --> 02:01:25,969
I never would have considered that.

1452
02:01:26,569 --> 02:01:30,855
Have I just reached some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1453
02:01:31,323 --> 02:01:34,765
KING: (LAUGHS) No, you haven't.
<FONT COLOR="#808080">JOHN: I wouldn't have thought of that.

There are some Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough....

I enjoy the flavor that they have.
I have not been in this room...

1461

...for quite some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

02:02:29,175 --> 02:02:34,178
I would have thought the nominations
for the Nobel Prize would've been secret.

1467
02:02:34,888 --> 02:02:38,204
I would have thought you'd only find out
if you won or lost.

1468

That is generally the case, yes,
but these are special circumstances.

1469
02:02:44,148 --> 02:02:45,869
The awards are substantial.

1470
02:02:46,568 --> 02:02:49,531
They require private funding as such...

to find out if I was crazy?

Find out if I would screw everything up
if I actually won?

strip naked and squawk like a chicken?

1475
02:03:10,133 --> 02:03:11,808
Something like that, yes.

02:03:13,512 --> 02:03:15,107
