Derivative drivel.

184
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,407
But Nash achievements.

185
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,876
zero.

186
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:35,675
I'm a patient man, Martin. Is
there an actual question coming?

187
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:40,185
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

188
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:42,220
Huh?

189
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,756
How will it feel when I'm
chosen for Wheeler...

190
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:47,986
and you're not?

191
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,695
What if you lose?

192
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:58,601
BENDER: Ah, there it is.

193
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:00,070
[Chuckles]

194
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:04,875
You should not have won.

195
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:06,377
Hmmm.

196
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:09,039
I had the first move, my...
my play was perfect.

197
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:10,604
The hubris of the defeated.

198
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,913
The game is flawed.

199
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,950
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

200
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,627
CHARLES: You've been
in here for two days.

201
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:36,502
You know Hansen's just
published another paper?

202
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,770
I can't even find a
topic for my doctorate.

203
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,006
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

204
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:48,878
This is a group playing
touch football.

205
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:52,355
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

206
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:57,985
And this here is a woman who is
chasing a man who stole her purse.

207
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,128
John, you watched a mugging.

208
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,667
That's weird.

209
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,431
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

210
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:09,201
Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.

211
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,608
See, if I could
derive an equilibrium

212
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:15,238
where prevalence is a
non-singular event,

213
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:17,646
where nobody loses,

214
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:20,941
can you imagine the effect that
would have on conflict scenarios

215
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:23,154
-and arms negotiations...
-When did you last eat?

216
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:25,790
-When did you last eat?
... Currency exchange?

217
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,721
You know, food.

218
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:32,156
You have no respect for cognitive
reverie, you know that?

219
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,791
Yes. But pizza...

220
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:39,303
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

221
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:42,465
And of course beer.

222
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,574
I have respect for beer.

223
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:54,409
I have respect for beer!

224
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
-BENDER: Good evening, Neils. Ladies...
-HANSEN: Hey, Nash.

225
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,163
Who's winning? You or you?

226
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:08,927
-BENDER: Evening, Nash.
-SOL: Hey, guys.

227
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,866
Hey, Nash.

228
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:13,734
WOMAN: He's looking
at you for sure.

229
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,036
Hey, Nash.

230
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,739
Neils is trying to
get your attention.

231
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:24,146
-BENDER: You're joking.
-SOL: Oh, no.

232
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:31,881
-Go with God.
-Come back a man.

233
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:36,023
-Fortune favors the brave.
-Bombs away.

234
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:42,131
Gentlemen, might I remind
you that my odds of success

235
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:44,169
dramatically improve
with each attempt?

236
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,837
This is going to be classic.

237
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:28,478
Maybe you wanna buy me a drink.

238
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,312
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say

239
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:37,446
in order for you to have
intercourse with me,

240
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,184
but could we assume
that I said all that?

241
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,127
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

242
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:46,130
So, could we just go
straight to the sex?

243
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,131
Oh, that was sweet.

244
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,163
Have a nice night, asshole!

245
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:55,399
-[Man Laughs]
-NEILSON: Ladies, wait!

246
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,100
CHARLES: I...

247
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:01,211
I especially liked the bit about
fluid exchange. It was...

248
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,139
... really charming.

249
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:08,982
PROFESSOR: Walk with me, John.

250
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:10,817
I've been meaning
to talk with you.

251
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:15,553
The faculty is completing
mid-Year reviews.

252
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:18,190
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

253
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:19,456
-Wheeler, sir. That would be
-And....

254
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,082
-my first choice. And actually, I don't
-John...

255
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,930
-really have a second choice, sir.
-I know, John...

256
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:25,029
-I don't really have a second choice.
-John, your fellows have attended classes.

257
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,331
They've written papers.
They've published.

258
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,533
I'm still searching,
sir, for my...

259
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:32,133
-Your original idea, yes, I know.
-Governing dynamics, sir.

260
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:33,872
It's very clever,
John, but I'm afraid

261
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,210
it's just not
nearly good enough.

262
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:44,152
-May I?
-Thank you.

263
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:46,884
I've been working on
manifold embedding.

264
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,359
My bargaining stratagems are
starting to show some promise.

265
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,089
If you could just arrange
another meeting,

266
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:52,562
if you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein...

267
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,623
-I've repeatedly asked you for that, sir.
-Now, John.

268
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,874
-I'd be able to show him
-John...

269
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,158
-my revisions on his...
-John...

270
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,669
John.

271
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:02,165
Do you see what they're
doing in there?

272
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,902
-PROFESSOR: Congratulations.
-MAX: Thank you so much.

273
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:07,844
Congratulations, Professor Max.

274
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,313
-MAX: Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

275
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:12,783
It's the pens.

276
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:15,115
Reserved for a member
of the department

277
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,087
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime.

278
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,818
Now, what do you see, John?

279
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:22,622
Recognition.

280
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:25,458
Well done, Professor, well done.

281
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,965
Well, try seeing accomplishment.

282
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,830
<i>Is there a difference?</i>

283
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:31,199
John,

284
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,761
you haven't focused.

285
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:38,301
I'm sorry, but up to this point,

286
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:41,073
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

287
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:46,144
Good day.

288
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,490
And my compliments to you, sir.

289
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,657
Thank you so much.

290
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,250
I can't see it.

291
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,286
[Whimpers]

292
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:28,591
-Aah!
-Jesus Christ, John.

293
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,060
I can't fail.

294
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:34,030
-This is all I am.
-Come on, let's go out. Come on.

295
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,090
-I got to get something done.
-John!

296
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:39,001
-I-I can't keep staring into space...
-John, it's enough!

297
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,596
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules...,

298
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:42,582
You wanna do some damage?

299
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:43,187
-That's fine...
-read their books...

300
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:44,501
-But don't mess around...
-Do their classes.

301
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:47,070
Come on! Go on, bust your head!

302
00:17:47,146 --> 00:17:48,841
Kill yourself.

303
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,680
John, do it. Don't mess around.

304
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,479
Bust your head! Go on,

305
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,520
bust that worthless
head wide open.

306
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,714
Goddamn it, Charles! What
the hell is your problem?!

307
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,720
It's not my problem.

308
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:08,560
And it's not your problem.

309
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,334
It's their problem.

310
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:15,498
Your answer isn't face the wall.

311
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:17,940
It's out there...

312
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,637
where you've been working.

313
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,260
-[Panting]
-[Gasps]

314
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,357
That was heavy.

315
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:49,101
That Isaac Newton
fellow was right.

316
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,971
-He was onto something.
-Clever boy.

317
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,271
[Giggles]

318
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,039
JOHN: Don't worry, that's mine.

319
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:56,307
I'll come and get
it in a minute.

320
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,781
-[Both laughing]
-Oh, God.

321
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:03,916
-NEILSON: Incoming, gentlemen.
-SOL: Ay-Yi-Yi.

322
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:10,661
[Sighs] Deep breaths.

323
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:12,424
SOL: Nash, you
might want to stop

324
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:15,728
shuffling your papers
for five seconds.

325
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,030
I will not buy you
gentlemen beer.

326
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,666
BENDER: Oh, we're not
here for beer, my friend.

327
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:26,903
-JOHN: Oh.
-[Sol Chuckles]

328
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,076
Does anyone else feel she should
be moving in slow motion?

329
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,811
Will she want a large
wedding, ya think?

330
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,352
Shall we say swords, gentlemen?

331
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,389
-Pistols at dawn?
-Have you remembered nothing?

332
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:40,789
Recall the lessons
of Adam Smith,

333
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,793
the father of modern economics.

334
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:44,692
"In competition..."

335
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:47,425
SOL AND NEILSON: "individual
ambition serves the common good".

336
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,831
-Exactly.
-Every man for himself, gentlemen.

337
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:52,893
BENDER: And those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

338
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:54,563
HANSEN: I'm not
gonna strike out.

339
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,369
SOL: You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

340
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,433
-I don't think he said that.
-SOL: Nobody move...

341
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:01,570
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

342
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:04,342
HANSEN: Oh, God. He may
have the upper hand now,

343
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,475
but wait until he
opens his mouth.

344
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:08,416
-[Laughing]
-Remember the last time?

345
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:11,012
BENDER: Oh, yes, that was
one for the history books.

346
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,792
Adam Smith needs revision.

347
00:20:18,864 --> 00:20:20,832
What are you talking about?

348
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:23,561
If we all go for the blonde...

349
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,698
we block each other.

350
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:34,036
Not a single one of
us is gonna get her.

351
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,774
So then we go for her friends,

352
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,610
but they will all give
us the cold shoulder

353
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:42,244
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

354
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,255
Well, what if no one

before we have sex.

713
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:11,528
I am proceeding with
those activities,

714
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:13,626
but in point of actual fact,

715
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:17,800
all I really want to do is have
intercourse with you as soon as possible.

716
00:48:19,943 --> 00:48:22,104
Are you gonna slap me now?

717
00:48:46,703 --> 00:48:48,796

719
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:14,854
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned re-occurrences

720
00:49:14,931 --> 00:49:17,559
within periodicals over time...
and you?

721
00:49:17,634 --> 00:49:19,864
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

722
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:26,041
Do I know you?

723
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:30,205
My uncle says you're very
smart but not very nice,

724
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,373
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

725
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:34,474
And who might your uncle be?

726
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:36,985
The prodigal roommate...

727
00:49:37,053 --> 00:49:38,918

-Come here.
-Charles, Charles, Charles.

730
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,460
My sister...

731
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:54,902
got herself killed
in a car crash.

732
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:57,567
Not too far now, Marcee!

733
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:01,041
Her cowboy husband was too drunk

734
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:03,238
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

735
00:50:03,313 --> 00:50:05,747
So, I took her in.

736
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:10,412
-She's so small.
-She's young, John. That's how they come.

737
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,580
I'm at Harvard...

738

author's workshop.

740
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:21,690
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

[Chuckles]

742
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,961
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

743
00:50:27,971 --> 00:50:30,201
How are you, John?

744
00:50:30,273 --> 00:50:33,299
At first all my work
here was trivial,

745
00:50:33,376 --> 00:50:36,072
but a new assignment
came up and...

746
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:39,138
I can't really tell
you any details.

747
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:41,548
Top secret? Black bag?
Black ops?

748
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:43,779
Something like that.

749
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:47,551
-And, uh...
-Yes?

750
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:49,524
Well, I... I met a girl.

751
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:52,528
-No! A human girl?
-Homo sapiens.

752
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,791
-A biped?
-Yup. And contrary to all probabilities,

753
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:57,299
she finds me attractive on a
number of different levels.

754
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:58,231
[Laughs] Really?

755
00:50:58,301 --> 00:51:01,498
God, that's wonderful.

756
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:04,438
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

757
00:51:06,443 --> 00:51:08,570
Should I marry her?

758
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:10,613
Oh, God. Right.

759
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,944
I mean, everything's going well.

760
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:15,610
The job is fine. I
have enough money.

761
00:51:15,685 --> 00:51:17,346
It all seems to add up.

762
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,355
But how do you know for sure?

763
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:25,695
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

764
00:51:25,762 --> 00:51:27,855
That's the only sure
thing I do know.

765
00:51:34,871 --> 00:51:36,862
WAITER: Good evening.

766
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:45,581
Alicia, please don't be angry.

767
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:47,207
I just lost track
of time at work...

768
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:50,378
-again.
-Mm-hmm.

769
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:52,944
I'm sorry.

770
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,955
I didn't have time to wrap it.

771
00:51:56,526 --> 00:51:58,517
Happy birthday.

772
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:04,858
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

773
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:06,732
they create a full
wavelength dispersal,

774
00:52:06,803 --> 00:52:08,828
so if you look inside
it, you can see...

775
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:11,533
-Every possible color.
-Every possible color.

776
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:12,836
Yeah.

777
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:15,469
Remember you said that time
God must be a painter,

778
00:52:15,545 --> 00:52:18,343
because of all the colors?
At the governor's house...

779
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,212
you said that.

780
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:22,444
I didn't think you
were listening.

00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:27,014

784
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:54,912
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?

785
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:56,748
'Cause I need some
kind of proof,

786
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,050

Well, how big is the universe?

796
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,683
I know because all the

-No.

-You haven't seen it.
-No.

I don't, I just believe it.

the part that you don't know...

I'll explain when I can.

893
01:02:50,613 --> 01:02:52,547
MARCEE: Uncle John!

894
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,708
Uncle John!

895
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:56,877
[Growls]

896
01:02:56,953 --> 01:03:00,411
-Hey, baby girl!
-[Marcee Laughing]

897
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:03,253
Wow, someone needed a hug!

898
01:03:03,326 --> 01:03:05,954
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

899
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:08,223
"How can I miss seeing
a guest lecture"

900
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:10,492
"by the inimitable John Nash?"

901
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:15,433
What's wrong?

902
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:20,535
I got myself into something. I
think I might need some help.

903
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:22,541
Well, now you tell
me, what is it?

904
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:24,807
WOMAN: Professor Nash!

905
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,144
Welcome!

906
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,648
After?

907
01:03:36,258 --> 01:03:40,388
JOHN: So, we see that the...
the zeroes,

908
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:43,057
of the Reimann zeta function,

909
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:45,862
correspond to singularities

910
01:03:45,935 --> 01:03:49,132
in space-time,

911
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:52,140
singularities in space-time...

912
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:57,912
And conventional
number theory...

913
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:04,377
it breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

914
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,794
Sometimes our expectations

915
01:04:21,871 --> 01:04:24,305
are betrayed by the numbers.

916
01:04:24,373 --> 01:04:27,433
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

917
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:30,070
rational value.

918
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:52,059
Professor Nash!

919
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:04,439
-Hold it!
-Professor Nash?

920
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:08,646
Professor Nash,

921
01:05:08,718 --> 01:05:12,154
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

922
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:14,212
What do you want?

923
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:16,884
My name is Rosen,

924
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,984
Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.

925
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:22,155
Forgive me if I don't
seem persuaded.

926
01:05:22,231 --> 01:05:24,893
I'd like you to
come with me, John.

927
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:27,835
Just for a chat.

928
01:05:28,904 --> 01:05:30,929
It appears I have no choice.

929
01:05:34,076 --> 01:05:35,543
Oh-hh!

930
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:44,214
Help me! Somebody!

931
01:05:48,224 --> 01:05:49,782
[Screams] Somebody!

932
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:53,260
Help me! Get off me!

933
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,695
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

934
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:57,392
No, no, no, no, don't.

935
01:05:57,466 --> 01:05:59,366
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

936
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:01,232
Call somebody! Call
somebody, Charles!

937
01:06:01,303 --> 01:06:02,793
-They're Russians!
-Steady the leg.

938
01:06:02,872 --> 01:06:04,635
Get away from me.

939
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:06,971
Stay away from me!

940
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:14,372
DR. ROSEN: There, now.

941
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,281
All better.

942
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:22,187
-Everything's all right here.
-[Gasps]

943
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:26,086
Watch your head.

944
01:06:56,158 --> 01:06:58,524
[Dr. Rosen, Faintly] John?

945
01:06:59,528 --> 01:07:01,587
Can you hear me?

946
01:07:10,206 --> 01:07:12,731
[Faint Whispering]

947
01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:17,344
Go easy now.

948
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:20,382
Thorazine takes a little
while to wear off.

949
01:07:23,452 --> 01:07:25,716
Sorry about the restraints.

950
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:28,313
You've got one hell
of a right hook.

951
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:31,553
[Weakly] Where am I?

952
01:07:33,362 --> 01:07:35,728
Macarthur Psychiatric Hospital.

953
01:07:38,634 --> 01:07:41,501
I find that highly unlikely.

954
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:43,094
You made a mistake.

955
01:07:43,172 --> 01:07:47,074
My work is non-military
in application.

956
01:07:47,142 --> 01:07:49,633
Which work is that, John?

957
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:53,544
I don't know anything.

958
01:07:53,616 --> 01:07:56,244
[Laughs] There's no good in
keeping secrets, you know.

959
01:07:58,587 --> 01:08:00,714
[Groans]

960
01:08:04,426 --> 01:08:06,656
[Buzzer]

961
01:08:12,434 --> 01:08:14,698
Charles?

962
01:08:16,105 --> 01:08:17,663
Charles?

963
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:21,342
I didn't mean to get
you involved in this.

964
01:08:23,646 --> 01:08:25,546
I'm... I'm sorry.

965
01:08:29,885 --> 01:08:32,251
Charles...?

966
01:08:39,393 --> 01:08:42,157
The prodigal roommate revealed.

967
01:08:44,266 --> 01:08:46,894
"Saw my name on the
lecture slate"?

968
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:49,130
You lying son of a bitch!

969
01:08:49,204 --> 01:08:51,900
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

970
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:54,568
How do you say, "Charles
Herman" in Russian?

971
01:08:54,643 --> 01:08:57,168
How do you say it in Russian?

972
01:08:57,246 --> 01:09:00,545
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

973
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:03,176
He's right there.
He's right there.

974
01:09:03,252 --> 01:09:06,346
Stop! I don't know anything!

975
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:09,084
Stop! I... I don't
know anything!

976
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:13,290
My name is John Nash.

977
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:15,023
I'm being held against my will.

978
01:09:15,097 --> 01:09:17,657
Somebody call the
Department of Defense.

979
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:19,462
My name is John Nash.

980
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:22,060
I'm being held against my will!

981
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:29,600
ALICIA: What's wrong with him?

982
01:09:32,281 --> 01:09:34,545
John has schizophrenia.

983
01:09:34,616 --> 01:09:38,382
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

984
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:43,816
But... But his work.

985
01:09:43,892 --> 01:09:46,156
He deals with conspiracies...

986
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:49,426
Yes, yes, I know.

987
01:09:49,498 --> 01:09:53,628
In John's world, these behaviors are...
accepted,

988
01:09:53,702 --> 01:09:55,329
encouraged.

989
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,840
As such, his illness may
have gone untreated

990
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,738
far longer than is typical.

991
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:03,368
What do you mean? How long?

992
01:10:03,445 --> 01:10:05,504
Possibly since graduate school?

993
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:08,846
At least that's when his
hallucinations seem to have begun.

994
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,283
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?

995
01:10:11,353 --> 01:10:13,583
One, so far, that I am aware of.

996
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:17,022
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

997
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:20,550
Charles isn't imaginary.

998
01:10:20,629 --> 01:10:23,223
He and John have been best
friends since Princeton.

999
01:10:23,298 --> 01:10:26,267
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

1000
01:10:26,335 --> 01:10:29,202
He's always in town for so
little time, lecturing.

1001
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:32,104
-Was he at your wedding?
-He had to teach.

1002
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:33,732
Have you ever seen
a picture of him,

1003
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:36,437
-talked to him on the telephone?
-This is ridiculous.

1004
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:38,673
I phoned Princeton.

1005
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:40,612
According to their
housing records,

1006
01:10:40,682 --> 01:10:42,582
John lived alone.

1007
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:48,890
Now, which is more likely...
that your husband,

1008
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:51,255
a mathematician with
no military training,

1009
01:10:51,326 --> 01:10:53,760
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians...

1010
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:55,490
You're making him sound crazy.

1011
01:10:55,564 --> 01:10:58,795
... Or, that he has lost
his grip on reality?

1012
01:11:01,236 --> 01:11:02,897
Now the only way I can help him

1013
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:04,336
is to show him the difference

1014
01:11:04,406 --> 01:11:07,170
between what's real

1015
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:09,403
and what is in his mind.

1016
01:11:12,047 --> 01:11:13,981
Come on.

1017
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:17,915
What's he been working on?

1018
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:20,921
His work is classified.

1019
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:23,253
He mentioned a supervisor

1020
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:25,850
by the name of William Parcher.

1021
01:11:25,928 --> 01:11:28,920
Maybe Mr. Parcher can
clarify things for us.

1022
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:31,465
But I can't get to him
without clearances.

1023
01:11:32,534 --> 01:11:34,024
You want me to help you get

1024
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:36,094
the details of my
husband's work?

1025
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:39,629
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.

1026
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:41,676
Is that what you think?

1027
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:48,815
-What did the doctor say?
-Is he sick?

1028
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:50,511
I don't know.

1029
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:51,815
I want to see what
Johns been working on.

1030
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:53,800
But Alicia, you know you
can't go in his office.

1031
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:54,972
You know, it's classified, Alicia.

1032
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:56,614
Stop.

1033
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:12,770
Oh, my God.

1034
01:12:16,845 --> 01:12:18,813
Oh, my God.

1035
01:12:25,754 --> 01:12:28,723
Why didn't you say something?

1036
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:31,816
Alicia, I mean,
John's always been

1037
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:34,260
a little weird.

1038
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:36,490
He said he was doing
code-breaking,

1039
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:38,760
that it was eyes-only.

1040
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:41,803
-Top secret, part of the military effort.
-Was he?

1041
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:44,939
Well, it was possible, you know? I mean,
directives come down all the time

1042
01:12:45,008 --> 01:12:47,207
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

1043
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:49,844
-It was possible.
-Possible, but...

1044
01:12:49,912 --> 01:12:51,743
not likely.

1045
01:12:53,448 --> 01:12:56,212
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated

1046
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:58,446
and then when you called...

1047
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,114
So, is this all he's
been doing every day?

1048
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:03,522
Cutting out magazines?

1049
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:07,789
Well, not all.

1050
01:14:08,357 --> 01:14:10,757
[Door Opens]

1051
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:32,469
-ALICIA: I'm so sorry.
-JOHN: It's okay.

1052
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:37,742
-I missed you.
-I missed you.

1053
01:14:40,155 --> 01:14:42,089
I have to talk to you.

1054
01:14:42,157 --> 01:14:44,250
Okay.

1055
01:14:48,897 --> 01:14:51,525
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

1056
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,195
and I do realize
that my behavior

1057
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:58,364
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you

1058
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,874
must have appeared insane.

1059
01:15:00,942 --> 01:15:03,103
I left you with no other choice.

1060
01:15:03,178 --> 01:15:05,373
I do understand...

1061
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:08,348
-and I'm truly sorry.
-That's okay.

1062
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:11,949
Everything's gonna be all right.

1063
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:15,616
Everything's gonna be all right.

1064
01:15:16,658 --> 01:15:18,626
We just have to talk quietly.

1065
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:24,321
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

1066
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,993
I'm gonna tell you
everything now.

1067
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:29,503
It's breaking with protocol

1068
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:31,505
but you need to know,

1069
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:35,475
because you have to help

01:47:54,781 --> 01:47:57,682
Of course, what are
old friends for?

1423
01:47:57,751 --> 01:48:01,380
Is that what we are, Martin?
Friends?

1424
01:48:01,454 --> 01:48:03,547
John, of course.

1425
01:48:03,623 --> 01:48:06,387
Of course. We always have been.

1426
01:48:11,598 --> 01:48:13,532
Alicia and I think that...

1427
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,397
That fitting in,

1428
01:48:15,468 --> 01:48:17,459
being part of a community,

1429
01:48:19,773 --> 01:48:21,536
might do me some good.

1430
01:48:21,608 --> 01:48:23,508
That a certain level
of attachment,

1431
01:48:23,576 --> 01:48:25,567
familiar places,
familiar people,

1432
01:48:27,047 --> 01:48:28,844
might help me...

1433
01:48:28,915 --> 01:48:31,406
elbow out these...

1434
01:48:34,721 --> 01:48:37,713
These certain delusions
that I have.

1435
01:48:42,395 --> 01:48:45,057
It's a lot to ask, and
now that I'm here,

1436
01:48:47,467 --> 01:48:49,628
I'm quite certain that
you will just say no.

1437
01:48:52,939 --> 01:48:55,737
But I was wondering if
I could hang around.

1438
01:48:56,776 --> 01:48:58,676
[Sighs]

1439
01:49:04,417 --> 01:49:05,907
Huh.

1440
01:49:09,956 --> 01:49:12,117
Will you be needing an office?

1441
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:18,294
No.

1442
01:49:21,101 --> 01:49:24,002
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1443
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:26,630
Well, this guy tries to
wander into the library,

1444
01:49:26,706 --> 01:49:29,903
-but he doesn't have I.D.
-Why can't people read their memos, huh?

1445
01:49:29,976 --> 01:49:31,671
Then he goes totally nuts.

1446
01:49:31,745 --> 01:49:33,975
JOHN: Not real! You're not real.

1447
01:49:34,047 --> 01:49:35,947
There's no mission.

1448
01:49:36,015 --> 01:49:38,313
Oh, shit. Shit.

1449
01:49:39,319 --> 01:49:42,117
Not real! You are not real!

1450
01:49:42,188 --> 01:49:44,053
Is this what you are, soldier?

1451
01:49:44,124 --> 01:49:45,421
Some useless ghoul?

1452
01:49:45,492 --> 01:49:47,483
The local madman?

1453
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:50,188
-I'm not a soldier.
-You're gonna end up in a cell!

1454
01:49:50,263 --> 01:49:52,527
Old, worthless, discarded.

1455
01:49:52,599 --> 01:49:53,827
There's no mission.

1456
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:55,527
And while you rock and drool,

1457
01:49:55,602 --> 01:49:57,160
the world will burn to ashes!

1458
01:49:57,237 --> 01:49:59,671
You are not real!
You are not real!

1459
01:49:59,739 --> 01:50:01,434
You're still talking
to me, soldier.

1460
01:50:01,508 --> 01:50:04,807
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1461
01:50:04,878 --> 01:50:06,505
John? John?

1462
01:50:06,579 --> 01:50:08,444
John, John, John, John.

1463
01:50:08,515 --> 01:50:09,846
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

1464
01:50:09,916 --> 01:50:11,474
John, John! It's okay.

1465
01:50:11,551 --> 01:50:13,678
I just heard what happened, I'm sorry.
John...

1466
01:50:13,753 --> 01:50:15,414
-I'm not a soldier.
-John. Hey, Nash.

1467
01:50:15,989 --> 01:50:17,354
Nash, hey.

1468
01:50:17,424 --> 01:50:19,415
Hey, you're all right.

1469
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,087
Nash, Nash, hey, hey, hey.

1470
01:50:26,866 --> 01:50:29,733
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1471
01:50:29,803 --> 01:50:31,498
HANSEN: John?

1472
01:50:33,106 --> 01:50:35,734
JOHN: You should've
seen their faces.

1473
01:50:35,809 --> 01:50:38,539
Everybody was just
staring at me.

1474
01:50:38,611 --> 01:50:40,238
John...

1475
01:50:40,313 --> 01:50:43,510
you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1476
01:50:43,583 --> 01:50:45,778
I know.

1477
01:50:48,054 --> 01:50:50,147
But then, on the way home,

1478
01:50:50,223 --> 01:50:53,056
Charles was there.

1479
01:50:56,896 --> 01:51:00,229
Sometimes, I really
miss talking to him.

1480
01:51:03,136 --> 01:51:05,536
Maybe Rosen's right.

1481
01:51:05,605 --> 01:51:09,097
Maybe I have to think about going
back into the hospital again.

1482
01:51:09,175 --> 01:51:11,166
No.

1483
01:51:11,244 --> 01:51:13,474
Come here.

1484
01:51:16,816 --> 01:51:19,649
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1485
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:47,146
John, now, you can't
ignore me forever.

1486
01:51:52,452 --> 01:51:54,647
Charles, you've been a
very good friend to me.

1487
01:51:54,721 --> 01:51:56,416
The best.

1488
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:00,855
But I won't talk to you again.

1489
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:06,425
I just can't.

1490
01:52:11,671 --> 01:52:14,162
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1491
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:16,333
[Sniffs]

1492
01:52:22,015 --> 01:52:23,676
Good-bye.

1493
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:32,655
Good-bye.

1494
01:52:46,573 --> 01:52:49,098
I was wondering if I
might audit your course.

1495
01:52:50,476 --> 01:52:53,502
It's... It's an honor,
Professor Nash.

1496
01:52:56,716 --> 01:52:58,809
Is something wrong?

1497
01:53:00,086 --> 01:53:02,384
This will be my first class.

1498
01:53:02,455 --> 01:53:04,582
[Laughs]

1499
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:08,386
Good morning,

1500
01:53:08,461 --> 01:53:10,691
eager young minds.

1501
01:53:17,837 --> 01:53:19,964
[Muttering Numbers]

1502
01:53:30,483 --> 01:53:32,815
It's never gonna work, John.

1503
01:53:32,885 --> 01:53:35,376
You're just
humiliating yourself.

1504
01:53:37,957 --> 01:53:40,084
It's pathetic!

1505
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:42,218
You are being pathetic.

1506
01:53:42,295 --> 01:53:44,286
I'm ashamed of you.

1507
01:53:59,045 --> 01:54:01,570
[Laughing]

1508
01:54:09,022 --> 01:54:11,456
[Laughing Continues]

1509
01:54:11,524 --> 01:54:13,617
Oh, man!

1510
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:20,322
Are you coming?
You're gonna be late.

1511
01:54:23,136 --> 01:54:24,967
-Dad, you've got my book.
-What?

1512
01:54:25,038 --> 01:54:26,699
You've got my book.

1513
01:54:26,773 --> 01:54:29,173
Oh, right.

1514
01:54:29,242 --> 01:54:30,709
Thanks.

1515
01:54:31,711 --> 01:54:33,440
-Good-bye.
-Bye.

1516
01:54:33,513 --> 01:54:35,310
ALICIA: See you tonight.

1517
01:54:35,381 --> 01:54:37,349
Bye, honey.

1518
01:56:09,842 --> 01:56:11,434
Did you just solve Reimann?

1519
01:56:11,511 --> 01:56:13,706
Well, what do you think?

1520
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:15,247
Huh.

1521
01:56:15,314 --> 01:56:16,838
That's an analog to Frobenius

1522
01:56:16,916 --> 01:56:18,884
for non-commutative extensions.

1523
01:56:18,951 --> 01:56:20,009
[Chuckles]

1524
01:56:20,086 --> 01:56:22,350
Yes, it is.

1525
01:56:22,421 --> 01:56:25,390
But it only appears to
work sporadically, so, no.

1526
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:27,585
But...

1527
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:29,992
I believe I'm making progress.

1528
01:56:30,997 --> 01:56:32,988
You're...

1529
01:56:33,065 --> 01:56:35,898
Youre John Nash, right?

1530
01:56:38,337 --> 01:56:40,430
-Toby Kelly.
-Hello.

1531
01:56:40,506 --> 01:56:42,303
I've been studying
your equilibrium.

1532
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:44,309
The one you wrote
here, at Princeton.

1533
01:56:44,377 --> 01:56:47,005
To come up with something totally
original, the way you did...

1534
01:56:47,079 --> 01:56:48,512
You know, I was young.
[Chuckles]

1535
01:56:48,581 --> 01:56:50,105
umm...

1536
01:56:50,183 --> 01:56:52,583
I've been developing a theory.

1537
01:57:06,866 --> 01:57:09,061
I believe I can prove

1538
01:57:09,135 --> 01:57:11,899
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1539
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:14,371
That everything,
everything is connected.

1540
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:17,102
That it's all part
of the same subject.

1541
01:57:18,177 --> 01:57:20,168
When was the last time you ate?

1542
01:57:20,246 --> 01:57:22,806
-Excuse me?
-You know, food.

1543
01:57:22,882 --> 01:57:24,850
Oh, uh...

My wife,

01:57:26,986 --> 01:57:28,817
she loves mayonnaise.

1546
01:57:28,888 --> 01:57:32,119
Oh, thank you.

1547
01:57:32,191 --> 01:57:33,419
Thank you.

1548
01:57:34,427 --> 01:57:36,292
Go on.

JOHN: ... coming together
at maximum speed of...

1554
01:57:52,378 --> 01:57:54,471
let us say 10 miles per hour.

1555
01:57:54,547 --> 01:57:57,846
So you have a fly on
the tire of bicycle B,

1556
01:57:57,917 --> 01:58:00,886
and the fly, who can travel
at 20 miles an hour,

1557
01:58:00,953 --> 01:58:02,614
leaves the tire of
bicycle B and it flies

1558
01:58:02,688 --> 01:58:04,815
to the tire of bicycle a
and backwards and forwards

1559
01:58:04,891 --> 01:58:07,223
and so on and so forth until
the two bikes collide

1560
01:58:07,293 --> 01:58:09,056
and the poor little
fly is squashed.

1561
01:58:09,128 --> 01:58:11,289
-[Chuckling]
-This is the important thing

1562
01:58:11,364 --> 01:58:13,389
about actually focusing
in and comprehending

1563
01:58:13,466 --> 01:58:15,491
the area that you're
dealing with.

1564
01:58:15,568 --> 01:58:18,401
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1565
01:58:18,471 --> 01:58:20,803
no matter what these people
around here will tell you,

1566
01:58:20,873 --> 01:58:22,306
especially the
people from biology.

1567
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:23,899
Don't listen to any
of those people.

1568
01:58:23,976 --> 01:58:26,308
Let me go back to what
you were doing before.

1569
01:58:26,379 --> 01:58:29,678
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1570
01:58:30,816 --> 01:58:33,114
I was thinking that
I might teach.

1571
01:58:34,487 --> 01:58:36,580
A classroom with 50 students

1572
01:58:36,656 --> 01:58:39,648
can be daunting for anyone.

1573
01:58:39,725 --> 01:58:42,558
John, besides, you're
a terrible teacher.

1574
01:58:43,562 --> 01:58:46,531
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1575
01:58:46,599 --> 01:58:49,568
I was hoping there still might
be something I could contribute.

1576
01:58:49,635 --> 01:58:51,626
What about the...

1577
01:58:51,704 --> 01:58:53,763
Well, you know.

1578
01:58:53,839 --> 01:58:56,205
Are they gone?

1579
01:59:02,181 --> 01:59:05,116
No, they're not gone.

1580
01:59:05,184 --> 01:59:06,811
And maybe they never will be.

1581
01:59:06,886 --> 01:59:08,615
But I've gotten used
to ignoring them

1582
01:59:08,688 --> 01:59:12,089
and I think as a result they've
kind of given up on me.

1583
01:59:12,158 --> 01:59:14,792
You think that's what
it's like with...

1584
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:17,857
... all our dreams and
our nightmares, Martin?

1585
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:20,956
You've got to keep feeding
them for them to stay alive?

1586
01:59:21,033 --> 01:59:24,525
John, they... haunt you, though.

1587
01:59:24,603 --> 01:59:29,302
Well, they're my past, Martin.

02:00:04,844 --> 02:00:06,937
-or you're gonna get me...
-I'll ring her.

1599
02:00:07,013 --> 02:00:08,378
...in an awful lot of trouble.

1600
02:00:12,251 --> 02:00:14,014
-Thanks, Professor.
-Good-bye.

1601
02:00:14,086 --> 02:00:15,433
-Have a nice day.
-Good-bye.

1602
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:16,478
See you.

1603
02:00:17,022 --> 02:00:18,955
-Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.
-Oh, yes, sir.

1604
02:00:19,025 --> 02:00:21,016
Professor Nash?

1605
02:00:24,263 --> 02:00:26,891
-Can you see him?
-Yeah.

1606
02:00:26,966 --> 02:00:28,558
-You sure?
-Uh-huh.

1607
02:00:28,634 --> 02:00:30,795
Positive? He's
within your vision?

1608
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:32,462
-[Laughing]
-Okay. Good.

1609
02:00:32,538 --> 02:00:35,530
Forgive me, I'm just always
suspicious of new people.

1610
02:00:35,608 --> 02:00:37,974
-See you next week, Professor.
-See you next week.

1611
02:00:39,011 --> 02:00:40,911
So now that I know
that you're real,

1612
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:43,448
who are you, and what
can I do for you?

1613
02:00:43,516 --> 02:00:46,917
Professor, my name
is Thomas King...

1614
02:00:46,986 --> 02:00:48,112
Thomas King?

1615
02:00:48,187 --> 02:00:49,586
... and I'm here to tell you

1616
02:00:49,655 --> 02:00:52,783
that you're being considered
for the Nobel prize.

1617
02:01:00,299 --> 02:01:03,029
JOHN: Forgive me, but I'm
just a little stunned.

1618
02:01:03,102 --> 02:01:05,593
KING: Over the past few
years your equilibrium

1619
02:01:05,671 --> 02:01:08,265
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1620
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:10,604
Suddenly everybody
likes that one.

1621
02:01:10,676 --> 02:01:14,976
What-what about my work on other some
such projects... manifold embedding?

1622
02:01:15,047 --> 02:01:18,244
The application of your
bargaining problem

1623
02:01:18,317 --> 02:01:22,651
to F.C.C. bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1624
02:01:22,721 --> 02:01:24,450
-Antitrust cases?
-Yes.

1625
02:01:24,523 --> 02:01:26,821
I never-I never would
have considered that.

1626
02:01:26,892 --> 02:01:28,484
-Well...
-Have I just reached some

1627
02:01:28,561 --> 02:01:31,291
level of honesty that
borders on stupidity?

1628
02:01:31,363 --> 02:01:33,228
[Laughs] No, no, you haven't.

1629
02:01:33,299 --> 02:01:35,324
'Cause, I wouldn't
have thought of that.

1630
02:01:40,439 --> 02:01:42,532
Shall we have tea?

1631
02:01:44,477 --> 02:01:46,843
Oh, I don't go in there.
I usually just

1632
02:01:46,912 --> 02:01:48,777
take my sandwich in the library.

1633
02:01:48,848 --> 02:01:52,841
Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1634
02:01:52,918 --> 02:01:54,943
M-Most...

1635
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:56,920
Most commercially
available brands of tea

1636
02:01:56,989 --> 02:01:58,616
are not suitable to
my palate, you see...

1637
02:01:58,691 --> 02:02:00,318
I'm not...

1638
02:02:00,392 --> 02:02:03,623
There are some northern Indian
teas which are dense enough...

1639
02:02:03,696 --> 02:02:06,290
I enjoy the flavor
that they have...

1640
02:02:06,365 --> 02:02:08,094
I have not been in this room

1641
02:02:08,167 --> 02:02:11,193
for quite some many years. I
wonder what tea they serve.

1642
02:02:12,838 --> 02:02:14,465
JOHN: Why, thank
you, young lady.

1643
02:02:16,842 --> 02:02:19,208
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1644
02:02:19,278 --> 02:02:21,542
I have a son that age.

1645
02:02:21,614 --> 02:02:24,583
-Harvard.
-[King Chuckles]

1646
02:02:27,786 --> 02:02:29,879
Hmm.

1647
02:02:29,955 --> 02:02:32,515
I would have thought
the nominations

1648
02:02:32,591 --> 02:02:35,059
for the Nobel prize
would have been secret.

1649
02:02:35,127 --> 02:02:38,563
I would have thought you'd only
find out if you won or lost.

1650
02:02:38,631 --> 02:02:40,792
That is generally the case, yes.

1651
02:02:40,866 --> 02:02:43,027
But these are special
circumstances.

1652
02:02:44,303 --> 02:02:46,601
The awards are substantial.

1653
02:02:46,672 --> 02:02:51,234
They require private funding.
As such,

1654
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:54,302
the image of the Nobel is...

1655
02:02:55,581 --> 02:02:58,641
I see. You came here to
find out if I was crazy?

1656
02:02:59,885 --> 02:03:02,115
Find out if I would

1657
02:03:02,188 --> 02:03:04,179
screw everything up
if I actually won?

1658
02:03:05,724 --> 02:03:08,887
Dance around the podium, strip
naked and squawk like a chicken,

1659
02:03:08,961 --> 02:03:10,326
things of this nature?

1660
02:03:10,396 --> 02:03:12,864
Something like that, yes.

1661
02:03:13,866 --> 02:03:15,857
Would I embarrass you?

1662
02:03:19,405 --> 02:03:21,566
Yes, it is possible.

1663
02:03:24,276 --> 02:03:26,369
You see, I...

1664
02:03:26,445 --> 02:03:29,437
I am crazy.

1665
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:33,611
I take the newer medications,

1666
02:03:37,022 --> 02:03:40,014
but I still see things
that are not here.

1667
02:03:42,228 --> 02:03:44,458
I just choose not to
acknowledge them.

1668
02:03:46,565 --> 02:03:48,396
Like a diet of the mind,

1669
02:03:48,467 --> 02:03:50,901
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1670
02:03:53,305 --> 02:03:56,206
Like my appetite for patterns.

1671
02:03:57,810 --> 02:04:01,803
Perhaps my appetite to
imagine and to dream.

1672
02:04:02,815 --> 02:04:04,749
MAN: Professor Nash.

1673
02:04:08,887 --> 02:04:12,323
It's good to have
you here, John.

1674
02:04:12,391 --> 02:04:14,325
Thank you.

1675
02:04:18,497 --> 02:04:22,934
-It's an honor, sir.
-Thank you very much.

1676
02:04:23,002 --> 02:04:24,731
A privilege, Professor.

1677
02:04:29,008 --> 02:04:30,498
Professor.

1678
02:04:35,848 --> 02:04:38,874
-Nicely done, John.
-Thank you, Tom.

1679
02:04:40,019 --> 02:04:41,816
Thank you.

1680
02:04:41,887 --> 02:04:44,583
Thank you.

1681
02:04:52,665 --> 02:04:54,997
Thank you, Ed.

1682
02:05:02,541 --> 02:05:05,510
That was certainly
most unexpected.

1683
02:05:05,577 --> 02:05:08,842
[Applause]

1684
02:05:26,498 --> 02:05:28,762
JOHN: Thank you.

1685
02:05:30,169 --> 02:05:32,763
[Applause Fades]

1686
02:05:32,838 --> 02:05:35,170
I've always believed in numbers.

1687
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,800
In the equations and logics

1688
02:05:37,876 --> 02:05:39,810
that lead to reason.

1689
02:05:39,878 --> 02:05:42,779
But after a lifetime
of such pursuits,

1690
02:05:43,515 --> 02:05:45,346
I ask,

1691
02:05:45,417 --> 02:05:47,977
what truly is logic?

1692
02:05:48,053 --> 02:05:51,181
Who decides reason?

1693
02:05:52,624 --> 02:05:56,082
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1694
02:05:56,161 --> 02:05:58,026
the metaphysical,

1695
02:05:59,498 --> 02:06:01,466
the delusional,

1696
02:06:02,568 --> 02:06:04,593
and back.

1697
02:06:06,271 --> 02:06:09,502
And I have made the most important
discovery of my career.

1698
02:06:11,443 --> 02:06:14,776
The most important
discovery of my life.

1699
02:06:17,216 --> 02:06:20,811
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love

1700
02:06:20,886 --> 02:06:23,912
that any logical
reasons can be found.

1701
02:06:27,326 --> 02:06:30,591
I'm only here tonight
because of you.

1702
02:06:31,797 --> 02:06:34,823
You are the reason I am.

1703
02:06:38,504 --> 02:06:41,337
You are all my reasons.

1704
02:06:45,177 --> 02:06:47,270
Thank you.

1705
02:07:40,866 --> 02:07:43,357
JOHN: So nice to have met you.

1706
02:07:46,071 --> 02:07:47,868
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1707
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:49,407
Bye-bye.

1708
02:07:49,475 --> 02:07:51,136
WOMAN: Bye-bye.

1709
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:54,145
-Are you ready to go now?
-Oh, yes, I am.

1710
02:07:54,213 --> 02:07:56,773
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1711
02:07:56,849 --> 02:07:59,647
Thank you so much.

1712
02:07:59,718 --> 02:08:01,083
Thank you.

1713
02:08:03,622 --> 02:08:05,852
What is it? What's wrong?

1714
02:08:10,128 --> 02:08:11,459
Nothing.

1715
02:08:12,464 --> 02:08:14,455
Nothing at all.

1716
02:08:16,401 --> 02:08:19,063
-Come with me, young lady.
-Oh-hh...

1717
02:08:19,137 --> 02:08:25,131
I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?

1718
02:08:25,210 --> 02:08:27,413
Where's it going to?

1719
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:50,896
<i>I will</i>

1720
02:08:50,969 --> 02:08:54,461
<i>Watch you</i>

1721
02:08:54,540 --> 02:09:01,343
<i>In the darkness</i>

1722
02:09:01,413 --> 02:09:05,281
<i>Show you</i>

1723
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:08,808
<i>Love will</i>

1724
02:09:08,887 --> 02:09:14,985
<i>See you through</i>

1725
02:09:16,762 --> 02:09:24,134
<i>When the bad dreams</i>

1726
02:09:24,202 --> 02:09:31,267
<i>Wake you crying</i>

1727
02:09:31,343 --> 02:09:37,373
<i>I show you</i>

1728
02:09:37,449 --> 02:09:45,618
<i>All love can do</i>

1729
02:09:46,892 --> 02:09:53,923
<i>What love can do</i>

1730
02:09:53,999 --> 02:09:57,935
<i>I will watch through the night</i>

1731
02:09:58,003 --> 02:10:02,099
<i>Hold you in my arms</i>

1732
02:10:02,174 --> 02:10:03,869
<i>Give you dreams</i>

1733
02:10:03,942 --> 02:10:09,141
<i>Where none will be</i>

1734
02:10:09,214 --> 02:10:13,344
<i>I will watch through the dark</i>

1735
02:10:13,418 --> 02:10:17,115
<i>Till the morning comes</i>

1736
02:10:17,189 --> 02:10:20,124
<i>All the light</i>

1737
02:10:20,192 --> 02:10:22,524
<i>I'll take you through the night</i>

1738
02:10:22,594 --> 02:10:25,427
<i>To see</i>

1739
02:10:26,431 --> 02:10:29,491
<i>The light</i>

1740
02:10:29,568 --> 02:10:32,799
<i>Showing us all love</i>

1741
02:10:32,871 --> 02:10:37,638
<i>Can be</i>

1742
02:10:38,977 --> 02:10:42,071
<i>I will</i>

1743
02:10:42,147 --> 02:10:45,480
<i>Guide you</i>

1744
02:10:45,550 --> 02:10:53,457
<i>With my bright wings</i>

1745
02:10:53,525 --> 02:11:00,863
<i>Stay till your heart</i>

1746
02:11:00,932 --> 02:11:09,636
<i>Learns to see</i>

1747
02:11:09,708 --> 02:11:15,146
<i>All love</i>

1748
02:11:15,213 --> 02:11:19,707
<i>Can...</i>

1749
02:11:19,785 --> 02:11:27,817
<i>Be.</i>

1750

[Female Vocal]
