00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,843
That's her!

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,738
Myon?

3
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,853
Myon!

4
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,871
Very impressive!

00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,290

You live around here?!

10

Right under your nose, huh?

11
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,842
Um, wanna ride?

12
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,219
C'mon.

13
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,116
You wish!

14
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,849
You've got it all wrong.

15
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,254
Oh, sure.

16
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:52,762
I live with my sister, my dad lives with
a younger woman.

17
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,230
It's a joke.

18
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,235
Mom left one night when we bailed out.

19
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:05,006
Sorry I haven't kept in touch.
My life's kind of a mess, well, still is.

20
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,514
Don't worry.
Nice to see you're still the same... size.

21
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,277
Haven't they gotten bigger?

22
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,248
My breasts?

23
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,412
Huh, no, your feet. Let's find you a drugstore.

24
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,817
Better yet, a love hotel.

25
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,913
Hey!

26
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,359
Don't move.

27
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,791
Thanks.

28
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,094
Ouch!

29
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,264
What're you doing?

30
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,544
Nishi...

31
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,546
Um...

32
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,019
Would you be sad
if I went out with someone else?

33
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,518
If I married him?

34
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,789
Married...

35
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,500
In junior high, I wrote her a note,
just "I like you a lot.' '

36
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,502
Next day, her turn, "me too."

37
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,631
Knocked me off my feet.

38
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,109
We were just 13,
never even held hands after school.

39
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:16,739
Being shy made things awkward right after...

40
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,977
...and we could only exchange letters, mails.

41
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,055
2 years later, during a school trip...

42
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,521
Would you be sad
if I went out with someone else?

43
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,290
<i>"Hotel Tariff"</i>

44
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:41,338
Made me think. I never had the guts
to make a move, always playing it safe.

45
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,500
Always waiting for someone
to help things develop.

46
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,543
Nishi, what do you want?

47
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:55,144
You don't fight, you don't get hurt,
you want me to do all the work.

48
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,849
But that's unfair. 'Cos I'm scared too.

49
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,950
We're not school kids anymore, y'know?

50
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,429
What?

51
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,698
I...

52
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:21,877
I still love you. Don't marry that guy!
I've loved you since I was 9!

53
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:27,713
You should marry me!!

54
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,123
I'm...

55
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,051
I'm really happy!

56
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,431
But I love him too.

57
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,906
But I'm so happy now!

58
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:54,071
Myon, I'm not sure I get it,
but give me some time.

59
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,580
Give me a chance, please.

60
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,911
OK, Nishi. Give it your best shot.

61
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,647
You bet!

62
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,686
Nishi?

63
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,156
Nishi? Nishi!

64
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,960
Think I'm too young to marry?

65
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,929
Yeah.

66
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:21,302
So, you'll be off limits to future suitors.

67
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:26,174
Some are crying themselves to sleep right now.

68
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,772
Well I hope you'll be really happy.

69
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:35,515
Too bad... you don't like me
like you used to...

70
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,884
What are you talking about?
I love you forever!

71
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,256
You haven't changed.

72
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,796
You can be sure about that!

73
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,422
You want to eat yakitori?

74
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,028
Sure!

75
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,035
My sister and I have our own place.

76
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,002
Really?

77
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,732
Gotta make a living.

78
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,405
We've given up on the loans.

79
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,479
I'm gonna run forever!

80
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,345
Cool!

81
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,984
- Hi. Hey, Nishi!
- Hi!

82
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:22,427
Nishi! What a surprise! Come sit over here.

83
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,127
Thanks.

84
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,666
Long time no see.

85
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:31,004
Yang, today's special, and a beer.

86
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,007
Have a drink first.

87
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:41,009
What've you been up to?
Working on your Mangas?

88
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,553
Yes. Got a job on the side.

89
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:47,956
You're going to Tokyo, right? Tokyo's great.

90
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:54,666
Lots of good looking women trying to make it
in TV, modeling.

91
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:59,363
When I got married,
I often went there on business.

92
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:06,810
I'd get invited to hostess bars where there'd
be a bunch of girls like that.

93
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:12,215
And I'd pick one out and... yum yum!

94
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:16,220
Students promoting stuff on the streets,
game show assistants...

95
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,052
- Sir...
- They sure were hot.

96
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:23,356
- You cheated?
- I was having fun, but they'd fall for me.

97
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:29,833
I had quite a rep, 5 girls in Tokyo,
3 in Osaka, those were the days...

98
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,666
- Don't listen to him.
- Sorry about this.

99
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:36,765
Meanwhile, these two popped out and...

100
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,812
- you don't sound too thrilled!
- Had to take care of them.

101
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,575
So that was it.

102
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:50,753
Y'know, if I'd gotten together with
that promo-girl...

103
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,885
I wouldn't be broke now.

104
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,757
Stop dreaming!

105
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,290
That's him.

106
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,128
Yep, dad hasn't changed at all.

107
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,726
His girlfriend's the same age as me.

108
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,203
Picked her up at a loan shark's office.

109
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,673
Riko? She's not quite on par with
the others though.

110
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,906
So you just forgot about her??

111
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,745
What a waste! Like keeping roses in the can!

112
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:24,812
- What?!
- Your wife! You didn't deserve her!

113
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,948
Why are you taking her side?

114
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,789
'Cause I love the women of the Uchida family!

115
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:35,823
You were surrounded by
3 of the most beautiful women!

116
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:40,372
I even planned a trip
to your home town last year!

117
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,033
Thinking the place'll be
swarming with girls like them!

118
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,042
Had to see the source!

119
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,813
Myon, maybe you should marry Nishi.
You'd be happier that way.

120
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,387
What're you talking about?

121
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,119
You love him. You wrote about him
all the time when you were in school.

122
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:06,631
- Wrote what?!
- Oh, Nishi this, Nishi that, Nishi, Nishi...

123
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,790
Dad!!

124
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,394
Ryo's nice too. But I prefer Nishi.

125
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,731
Hi!

126
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,500
Hi.

127
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,406
Ryo.

128
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,340
Sir?

129
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,376
Don't mind him.

130
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,245
This is Nishi.

131
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,383
This is Ryo.

132
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:32,685
Hi. Heard a lot about you. Pleased to meet you.

133
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,759
Same here.

134
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,985
Beer?

135
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,856
Yes.

136
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,655
Did you hear about Kenta's accident?

137
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:39,788
Yeah.

138
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,491
So please be careful.

139
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,226
Here Nishi.

140
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,437
Thanks.

141
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,939
You do Mangas, right?

142
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,911
Nishi promised to do one about me!

143
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,572
Yes, something naughty and sexy!

144
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,873
Can't wait...

145
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,142
Stop it!

146
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,683
Something nasty and kinky.

147
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,878
I wanna see that!

148
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:07,689
<i>Good looking guy, great bod',
seems trustworthy...</i>

149
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,353
<i>But wasn't something a little...</i>

150
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,125
<i>.... Odd when you came in?</i>

151
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:18,995
<i>We were talking about ME,
'bout how I'm the one for Myon.</i>

152
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:25,410
<i>You're in the way pal, a third wheel,
can't you see it?</i>

153
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,243
<i>I shouldn't embarrass her by competing
with him. Don't want them to feel awkward.</i>

154
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,717
I'll get my truck on the 25th.

155
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,655
Congratulations.

156
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,923
Carries a 5 ton load. I'll be making money!

157
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,963
- You're a truck driver?
- Thanks.

158
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:53,599
I used to do things like that. Hard stuff...

159
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,833
Had no idea, Nishi.

160
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,535
Well, my body's all I've got going for me!

161
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,443
<i>A real man alright...</i>

162
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:08,513
<i>Sensitive can mean neurotic. Women are
happier with these rough and simple types.</i>

163
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,416
<i>Nice smile too. I'm history. She's yours...</i>

164
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,334
Hello...

165
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,645
Here...

166
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,688
It'll dry soon.

167
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,533
Something wrong?

168
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,569
Your beer...

169
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,042
Hey!!

170
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,141
- You know this guy?
- The owner!

171
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:49,510
He's off today. I'm only here part-time.
I'm not sure where he is. Sorry.

172
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,587
OK.

173
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:05,261
Settle down Atsu. We're gonna wait for him.

174
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,934
Right here...

175
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,969
I think he said he was taking
a couple of days off somewhere.

176
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:24,948
I knew it, off to a holiday resort.

177
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:31,221
With MY World Cup tickets, having fun.

178
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,334
Stop it! I'll call the police!

179
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,278
Say, you're kinda cute.

180
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,311
What the fuck are you doing you scum?

181
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,331
And who do you think you are?

182
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,468
Stop it!

183
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,000
Ryo!

184
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,308
Stop it!

185
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:27,645
Atsu, that's enough, put that piece away!!

186
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,249
I said put it away!!

187
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,030
- What?!
- You don't know what's going on, bro'!

188
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,832
I do.

189
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:54,607
No, you don't! My little Riko,
that old fuck, he...

190
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,147
He coerced her!!

191
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:04,654
I know Atsu, but you don't mix business
with private stuff. We're professionals.

192
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:12,460
Y'know, I've been meaning to tell
you - you've got no taste.

193
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:22,402
Teen car, fag watch, just plain bad taste.

194
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:28,413
Me, I'm different, I'm a player.
Not a business man, but an artist!

195
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,414
Personal stuff IS my business!

196
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:35,044
Watch your mouth! You don't even know
the meaning of the word artist!

197
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,716
Oh... Atsu, sorry man,
didn't know you felt that way.

198
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,193
Do whatever you want...

199
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:48,357
I'm cool, it's just,
I get mad when I think about that guy!

200
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,694
Raping my Riko, keeping her locked in...

201
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:57,270
Yeah, well if you put it that way,
it's your call.

202
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,740
Say Atsu, can I add something?

203
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,047
NO!

204
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:23,928
Too bad he's out... he'd understand how I feel,
my hurt, my grief...

205
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:28,666
If he sees ME raping HIS girlfriend right here!

206
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:33,905
I don't know this guy,
first time he comes in here.

207
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,507
Well it's true!

208
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,583
Bro, this bitch is lying!

209
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,283
You cunt!

210
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,390
They give it up so quickly.

211
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,455
All of 'em.

212
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,894
Wow, great boobs!

213
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,165
Don't move.

214
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,478
That's right, like that.

215
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,549
Shut the fuck up!

216
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:21,249
Say, those are sexy undies.

217
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,325
Kinda sparse down there, don't move,
show it to me.

218
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,361
Nishi, are you there?

219
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,869
Nishi?

220
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:43,146
Is he here? Where is he, this way?

221
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:50,618
This ball couldn't be him, now could it?

222
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,384
Where are you?

223
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:04,128
This you? Curled up like a ball?
You wanted some, didn't you?

224
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:09,168
Well, turn around, take a look at that pussy.

225
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,536
You know you want to.

226
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:15,670
Your turn after, amigo.

227
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,308
Come on, get up and get I T up!

228
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,017
I...

229
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,582
I...

230
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

231
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,057
Hurt you!

232
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,222
No way!

233
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,366
Ha! Did you hear that, gonna hurt you he said!

234
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,037
Put a bullet in him, on cue, just when he said
"hur!" Out the front before "t!"

235
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,110
Miserable loser!

236
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,788
That's not funny.

237
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:05,119
I was looking at you, you're gross.

238
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,723
What are you saying bro'?

239
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,301
Too gross. Don't move. You piss me off.

240
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,440
- I'm sorry, forgive me, please!!
- Don't move!

241
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,805
I'll do anything!

242
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,309
ATTEN-TION!

243
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:29,585
Say "shit-pee-dick" 10 times. Very fast.

244
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,856
And add a kiss to the last one.

245
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,051
Bro'...

246
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,652
Add a kiss and I'll forgive you!

247
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:48,339
Shit-pee-dick... shit-pee-dick...
shit-pee-dick...

248
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,170
Er, Shit-pee-dick-smack!

249
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,673
You promised...!!

250
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:08,552
Think about what you did on your way to hell.

251
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:15,695
Sorry about the trouble,
but it's the owner's...

252
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,468
Ah, forget it.

253
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,504
I'll have a beer & a stick.

254
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,731
If I only had one of those magic time belts,
turn it back...

255
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,205
<i>"RECAP"</i>

256
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,278
<i>"ANGER BAROMETER"</i>

257
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,210
Nishi, are you there?

258
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:45,281
Where is he, this way?

259
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,785
This ball couldn't be him, now could it?

260
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:57,062
This you? You wanted some, didn't you?
Well turn around and...

261
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,001
I...

262
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,537
I...

263
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,301
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

264
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,566
I'm gonna hurt you!

265
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,020
- I'm
- No!

266
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,488
- Gonna
- Stop!

267
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,865
- Hurt You
- Stop, please!

268
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,016
<i>"Sucks, doesn't it?"</i>

269
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:34,754
<i>"Lame, aren't you?"</i>

270
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:41,764
<i>"A fart, no?"</i>

271
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,869
<i>"Snot?"</i>

272
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:52,439
OK, I get it! I'm not cool!
I'm useless! And no fun!

273
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,418
<i>"Bird shit?"</i>

274
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,683
I'm a snot, I know! So, stop this!

275
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,384
Stop! Stop!

276
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,552
STOP!!

277
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,247
Something's wrong with my eyes!

278
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,252
I keep changing, right?

279
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,722
You can't decide what I should look like.

280
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,360
Who are you?

281
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,467
You know. It's flickering there in your mind.

282
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,573
Come on, let it go.

283
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:57,808
What's the first thing that comes to mind?

284
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,907
<i>"G-O-D"</i>

285
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,816
G... God!

286
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,220
There we are.
Not that how you call me matters.

287
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:09,657
A, B, they're just symbols anyway.

288
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,430
Confused? Wanna see my tits?

289
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:20,433
The only way to make it stop is to be honest.
Easier to see the truth that way.

290
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:26,943
The truth for you, that is.
Too late for counseling though.

291
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:33,209
Since you're DEAD. What a shame!

292
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,857
Dead... I'm... dead?

293
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,226
Really?

294
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:48,623
Just like that? Gone at 20?

295
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:54,127
Why was I born then?

296
00:27:55,974 --> 00:28:02,880
So you could have fun at my expense?!

297
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,142
What's wrong with that, huh?

298
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:18,727
Yeah, so I made you on a whim!
I made you, dipshit, for my sheer enjoyment!

299
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,964
What's wrong with that?

300
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,997
Oops, I have to go.

301
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,173
- Got a date.
- A date?!

302
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:38,406
Time's up. Go straight that way
and keep walking. You'll soon disappear.

303
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,678
And my next life?

304
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,015
- Huh?
- Next life?

305
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:48,650
Your what? Told you it's over. Start walking.

306
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:57,024
And disappear? No afterlife? We're done?

307
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:02,364
It's really over?!

308
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,211
Really, really, really over?! God?

309
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:16,918
Will you shut up! You saw how you got here,
multiple p-o-v's of your brain exploding.

310
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:22,416
A shocking documentary of your death,
deftly edited by moi!

311
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:28,657
You are DEAD!

312
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:35,832
I'm officially dead?

313
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,107
Them's the breaks Nishi.

314
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,092
Straight ahead and disappear...

315
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:08,831
So if I go the other way...

316
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,305
Hey! What're you doing?! I'll be late!

317
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,441
Wait!

318
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,487
Let me through, I'm going back!

319
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,856
Not down for the count, huh?

320
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:34,129
You're gonna fade away, that's how it works.
See, you're already fading.

321
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,872
I don't believe you! I'm not gonna disappear!
I'm going back!

322
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,271
Won't happen.

323
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:48,334
I'll make it, I'll get there, you'll see!

324
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:56,151
Not bad, can you keep it up?
With that brain? Body?

325
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,822
I'm gonna take care of that creep!

326
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,893
Be stronger! Determined! Free and happy!

327
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:07,328
Live life to the fullest!

328
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,065
Pretty good...

329
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:18,307
Alright give it your best shot.

330
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:23,073
YES! I'm going back! I'm gonna do this!

331
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,877
I'm on your side... I'm on your side...

332
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:34,886
Your turn after, amigo. Get up and get IT up!

333
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,162
Never... never...

334
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,698
Never again!

335
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,701
Don't move!

336
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,407
Yang, come here.

337
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:10,317
I'll blow your head off if you move,
I'm done being the loser.

338
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,221
Give me the car keys.

339
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,595
Nishi...

340
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,797
You're on your own sir, come on, let's roll!

341
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:22,804
Hey!

342
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,101
Get in!

343
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,435
Wait...

344
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,243
Atsu got wasted.

345
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:39,785
My fault... They're in my car, we'll get them.

346
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,452
My apologies.

347
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,340
Nishi, watch out!

348
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,508
Help!!

349
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:10,016
And a hero is born...

350
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,850
Hands on the wheel!!

351
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:18,362
Don't worry, I'm on it. I'll protect you!
I love you both!

352
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:25,593
Moron, eyes on the road! Why are we running?
We should go to the police, self defense, right?

353
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:32,973
No! No! No! No cops, no questions,
no regrets! I'm through with that!

354
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,513
Making a break for it, with you two!
Like I want.

355
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:40,641
No one's gonna get in my way!

356
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:45,279
I'm following my heart's desires!
Like an outlaw!

357
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,904
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

358
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:12,407
<i>I do hope you realize you were living
in paradise till today.</i>

359
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:19,848
<i>Like angels flying around in heaven.</i>

360
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:25,090
<i>But now you're on a super express to hell!</i>

361
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:37,269
The guy you smoked, that bald S.O. B, Atsu?

362
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:45,908
Fine football player and athlete,
known as the Maradona of Osaka.

363
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:51,145
For good and for bad reasons.

364
00:34:51,656 --> 00:35:00,530
Beautiful bod' like a wild animal.
Not that it has to do with anything.

365
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:06,828
You knew Atsu was packing,
that the car was full drugs,

366
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:13,275
money, you knew all that, you planned it.

367
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:17,336
A clear cut armed robbery and murder case.

368
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:25,220
His folks abandoned him,
he grew up without love.

369
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:30,784
Got tickets for the World Cup,
for him and his girl.

370
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,524
A model Japanese footie fan.

371
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:42,632
But just before the game,
a young guy like you puts out his light.

372
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,568
Ah, the ever-egocentric,
unfeeling youth of today!

373
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:52,249
<i>Immature adults on the loose,
everything a blur except their friends.</i>

374
00:35:52,350 --> 00:36:03,818
<i>Living life like a video game,
finger on the reset button!</i>

375
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:08,126
<i>You're a roller-coaster with no breaks.!</i>

376
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,328
It's not true, you're making it up.

377
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:21,172
Typical story, nice and easy
for the cops to follow.

378
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:28,112
What I'm sayin' is, nobody's on your side.

379
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,816
This is it, kids. Make it a good game!

380
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,392
Nice speech old man.

381
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,429
Will you stop it!

382
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:46,132
- I can see you sweating in front of a prompter.
- Nishi!

383
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,134
It's improv!

384
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,838
Sure.

385
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,038
What?!

386
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:04,779
This roller-coaster you're trying to stop
is a genuine Angel Express.

387
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,422
And I can see you moved to tears
as you watch that mystic angel...

388
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:15,056
...spread its wings and disappear into the sky.

389
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,294
The fuck?!

390
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,224
Fuck!

391
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,933
Nishi!

392
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,764
Offside!

393
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,675
Asshole, this ain't football!

394
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,879
Now get in as close as you can!

395
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,215
Offside-trap!

396
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,049
STUNT DRIVING!

397
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:25,994
My nose is bleeding!

398
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:26,995
Mine too!

399
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,793
Mine too!

400
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,559
The bridge!

401
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,878
What the fuck are you doing?!

402
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,438
My Pitch, my little pitch!

403
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,973
Pitch! You came back! Pitch!

404
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,592
No more fooling around.

405
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,098
<i>We'll get 'em on the bridge.</i>

406
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:43,196
<i>Perfect defense plan. Even Zidane and Figo
couldn't get through. We'll get 'em.</i>

407
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,746
Whale?

408
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,271
What, you again?!

409
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,307
Not just yet!

410
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:55,041
You there, Nishi?

411
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,246
Are we... dead?

412
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,046
You both there? Wait a sec...

413
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:04,751
Where is it?

414
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,188
Bingo!

415
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,362
We're alive...

416
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:14,928
Thank God.

417
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,364
Seawater? Can't see shit.

418
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,231
Near the harbour, maybe.

419
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,532
Smells fishy...

420
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,573
Have no fear!

421
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,583
Fear takes the shape we're willing to give it.

422
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,916
Let's light a candle in our hearts,
make it gleam.

423
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,817
Try to enjoy the moment.

424
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,519
In spite of this turn of events.

425
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,426
<i>"This is FUN"</i>

426
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:49,026
This will shed a new light on things.

427
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,361
Remember our days in grade school?

428
00:42:55,773 --> 00:43:00,972
When it was all play,
no restrictions or tomorrows?

429
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,775
We didn't end up here 'cos we were chased.

430
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:08,678
We came here seeking adventure!
An epic journey!

431
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,084
Let the party begin!

432
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,721
Hey, there's a boat!

433
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,391
Let's check it out!

434
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:28,068
Lane No.1, Nishi! 3rd Grade! And I'm off!

435
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,368
Hey, let's go.

436
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:41,377
Lane No.2, Myon!
Also, 3rd Grade, and here I go!

437
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,967
Wow, what a wreck.

438
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:32,335
Where are we?

439
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,903
Stinks.

440
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:39,104
I'm starving! Good for my figure, though.

441
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,973
Your body is DOPE!

442
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,515
Which you haven't seen. I just look slim.

443
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,510
Show me then!

444
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,949
No way.

445
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,315
Please!

446
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,183
Nope.

447
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:52,755
Please!

448
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,718
Sugar on top!

449
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:55,621
Nah.

450
00:44:55,726 --> 00:45:00,060
- Aw, c'mon!
- Nishi! What now, huh?!

451
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,264
You almost got us killed!

452
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,699
Sure they were scum,
but you also popped a guy.

453
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,801
What's with the "enthusiasm?"

454
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:13,633
I was killed! Shot by that creep!

455
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:17,578
What the hell are you talking about?
He's the one that's gone dodo!

456
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:22,880
Before that. See, I was so scared
I lucked out on getting angry.

457
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,978
And that's when he shot me! Cueball mother!

458
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,288
Then I was sucked up to heaven and...

459
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,217
You've lost it.

460
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:35,992
But I believed in myself,
believed like nothing else, and I was back!

461
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,400
To live true to yourself,
sincerely, without restraint!

462
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:44,907
I realized it's the only weapon
against any wall!

463
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:51,738
OK, you've lost me.
But THIS is where it got us.

464
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,818
We're only here 'cos we were lucky.

465
00:45:55,052 --> 00:46:00,115
It's a miracle we're alive.
But if this keeps up, we'll be dead in no time.

466
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,533
I... I...

467
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,896
I...

468
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:20,236
I've got... a radio!!

469
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:23,871
A radio?

470
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,677
This place is dangerous, we need to move!

471
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,575
Hurry! Hurry!

472
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,556
- What the fuck?!
- C'mon, hurry!

473
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,522
- What is this?
- An earthquake? A tsunami?

474
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,966
- You guys are reckless!
- The fuck, old man?!

475
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:51,336
Hurry up! Grab an ore and row!

476
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,012
- Tidal wave?
- Tsunami!

477
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:01,415
Move it, people!

478
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,481
Over there!

479
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,749
Almost there!

480
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,523
Hang on!

481
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:33,048
Meal time's over. We're OK now.

482
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,851
Let's go up.

483
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:59,500
Wow! It's like a top secret lair!

484
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:05,506
TV, microwave, audio set, PC,
you've got everything!

485
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,841
So they just washed up?

486
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,914
Ah, and food!

487
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:17,191
And sexy lingerie! You dirty old man!

488
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,961
Let's see what's inside.

489
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:26,533
No power, huh?
This stuff's just for show, then?

490
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:27,931
Gross!

491
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,869
Think of it as modern art.

492
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,940
Want to freshen up?

493
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:38,508
Plenty of clean hot water?

494
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:41,584
- You mean have a bath?
- Yes! Yes!

495
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,817
I'd like that.

496
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,549
Yeah? Me too!

497
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,400
This is bliss!

498
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:09,405
But boy we're in some mess. It's surreal.

499
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:15,217
I mean, we're in God-knows-where
enjoying a total stranger's hospitality.

500
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:19,050
Having a bath... Unbelievable.

501
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:25,292
Well, he's on the way to a Happy Meal,
but he seems nice.

502
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:01,620
Once a perv, always a perv, huh?

503
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:06,126
I feel like it's the first time
we're having a real talk.

504
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,867
We'll leave clean clothes here!

505
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:17,137
Those bastards! Not very subtle are they?!

506
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,444
Let's pretend they're costumes.

507
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,280
Hey, find something we can actually wear!

508
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,016
Wow! Looks amazing!!

509
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,815
You made this?

510
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,524
Gramps?

511
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,520
Should've seen him at work.

512
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:37,760
Really? It's like a NY sushi bar.

513
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,031
Where'd you learn to cook, gramps?

514
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,571
Whoa!

515
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,249
Yeah, it's delicious!

516
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,977
5 stars in my book!

517
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,582
Bon apetit!!

518
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,023
Wow.

519
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,386
What a meal!

520
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,925
Thanks.

521
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:07,861
Much better than some fancy
rotating sushi bar in Kita.

522
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:13,700
They started serving
Westernized sushi last year.

523
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,567
Rotating sushi bars.

524
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,000
Rotating sushis.

525
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:21,671
Rotating sushis...

526
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,837
Not like that...

527
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,139
No, no.

528
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,843
In front of the customers.

529
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:37,115
Mines dead too.

530
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,796
It's a cell... phone?

531
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:43,457
A phone, a mobile phone?!

532
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,535
I knew it!

533
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:49,229
So, can we make contact with
the outside world??

534
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:54,474
Can't. It's soaked. Probably a goner.

535
00:51:55,946 --> 00:52:00,110
So, um, do robots exist now?

536
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:05,848
I saw a robot isle at the hardware
store the other day.

537
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,020
Yeah?

538
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,958
Yes! I knew it!

539
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:17,967
- How about flying cars?
- Huh?

540
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,738
Hmm, how long have you been here exactly?

541
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,579
More than 30 years.

542
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,510
I had a big deal going down...

543
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:38,019
Hid my stash in a comic book case...

544
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,251
But I took the wrong one...

545
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,333
Coastguards and DEA knew all about it anyway.

546
00:52:56,139 --> 00:53:00,007
Was running, lights flashing everywhere...

547
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:05,977
When a huge whale swallowed me.

548
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,973
Couldn't believe it.

549
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,887
And then what?

550
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:17,288
Got caught in the waves.

551
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,895
It was pitch dark when I came around.

552
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:25,225
Tried to escape but the waves were too rough.

553
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,665
<i>"TIME BO Y"
Tried again. And again.</i>

554
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:35,877
I couldn't have survived without my friends.

555
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,682
Um, where's the toilet?

556
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:45,187
The washroom? Straight ahead. I'll take you.

557
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:49,156
Nah, it's okay. Straight ahead, right?

558
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,764
Oh my God!

559
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,116
Hey, keep talking!

560
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:23,115
- Where's the "exit?"
- All the way down there.

561
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,920
- Oh, right!
- But of course!

562
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,120
Back to square one!

563
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:32,561
Got to know your own limits.

564
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,317
We're outta here.

565
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,516
We can go this way.

566
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,495
It's wobbling!

567
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,992
It's the only way, c'mon!

568
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,499
It'll be alright!

569
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:15,040
You'll get killed!

570
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,576
He's hungry again!

571
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:18,914
Hurry!

572
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,880
Come back!

573
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,417
Wait!

574
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,281
- The water's coming!
- Nishi!

575
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,783
There! The exit!

576
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,825
Put these on!

577
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,264
Nishi! Come back!

578
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,769
Nishi!

579
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,866
Hey, let go of me!

580
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:21,341
What the...?!

581
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:37,954
Nishi, you're awake!

582
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:42,287
What a relief! He's come around!

583
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,536
And here's something to cheer you up!

584
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,901
<i>And a "Happy Mornin"' to y'all!</i>

585
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,997
<i>Wow, is this a beautiful day or what?</i>

586
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:57,671
<i>You wouldn't believe how blue the sky was
this morning.</i>

587
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,680
In line with the solar system is...

588
00:56:59,782 --> 00:57:04,242
<i>Thought I'd drive
all the way to Brazil, y'know?</i>

589
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:07,686
<i>Well, it's gonna be booming
at the resorts today.</i>

590
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:13,729
<i>Certainly not a day for school
or work, I tell ya.</i>

591
00:57:17,132 --> 00:57:21,796
Now, now, now...

592
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:24,834
C'mon, cheer up!

593
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:30,708
You're homesick, I've been there.
I cried and got angry too.

594
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:33,748
But I realized after coming here...

595
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:36,579
Oh, whatever!

596
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:40,016
Got an idea! There's a place
that'll cheer you up.

597
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:41,783
Great friends too.

598
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:44,120
Let's go. Everybody!

599
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:48,090
<i>So wrecked cars are popping up everywhere.</i>

600
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:51,257
<i>Must've been some monster car chase...</i>

601
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:54,600
You haven't eaten properly in 3 days!

602
00:57:54,703 --> 00:57:56,796
You're not gonna last that way.

603
00:57:56,905 --> 00:57:59,840
You need to eat for your breasts' sake!

604
00:57:59,942 --> 00:58:02,877
And Nishi, you've eaten nothing!

605
00:58:02,978 --> 00:58:04,969
Forget about getting it up!

606
00:58:06,882 --> 00:58:08,076
Hey!

607
00:58:09,351 --> 00:58:10,750
Just shut up, okay?

608
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:32,867
Gramps, will you take me to that fun place
you mentioned about?

609
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:35,743
Wanna go? It'll be fun.

610
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:37,069
I need a change.

611
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:40,945
That's the spirit! You'll love it!

612
00:58:41,049 --> 00:58:43,108
Nishi?

613
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:44,651
You too!

614
00:58:45,754 --> 00:58:48,314
Nah... count me out.

615
00:58:48,423 --> 00:58:51,415
It'll be fun! You can meet my friends too!

616
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:54,189
Hearts'll sore! Heads'll explode!

617
00:58:54,329 --> 00:58:57,730
Cut it, Gramps. I'm not in the mood!

618
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:59,528
Just leave me alone!

619
00:59:02,004 --> 00:59:04,734
Join us later if you feel like it, okay?

620
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,501
Let's go, Myon.

621
00:59:06,808 --> 00:59:08,742
Let's go, let's go!

622
00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:10,705
This'll be a blast!

623
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:14,171
You'll love my friends.

624
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:29,959
Fuck! The look on his face!

625
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:32,295
He doesn't have a clue!

626
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:36,269
I only said those things
'cos he was being inconsiderate!

627
00:59:36,371 --> 00:59:38,100
How about a little kindness, huh?

628
00:59:38,206 --> 00:59:40,367
I'm hurt!

629
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:44,204
I have doubts about humanity!

630
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:48,742
What about my start in Mangas?!

631
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,115
What about my glorious campus life, huh?!

632
00:59:57,392 --> 00:59:58,450
Asshole!

633
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,050
Loser!

634
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,372
<i>"Help me God I'm sorry"</i>

635
01:00:26,755 --> 01:00:29,747
<i>30 years... 30 years...</i>

636
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:48,167
<i>Gotta drink your milk, honey.</i>

637
01:02:03,852 --> 01:02:04,716
<i>30 years...</i>

638
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:33,746
You okay?

639
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:36,613
Isn't it amazing, Nishi?

640
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:44,190
Gramps, I...

641
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:48,626
Er, what I said back there was...

642
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:55,300
I'd become a bad person.

643
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:58,372
I wanted to boast about my evil ways.

644
01:02:58,473 --> 01:03:02,102
I wanted to be known as a tough, rugged man.

645
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:05,543
I wanted to walk over everybody.

646
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:09,049
But I wound up here and...

647
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:11,451
I struggled.

648
01:03:11,553 --> 01:03:14,681
But I managed to survive!

649
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,258
I can swim again.

650
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,126
Catch things, walk, see.

651
01:03:22,664 --> 01:03:24,427
Isn't that fun?

652
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:30,665
Seawater's salty! This place stinks!
But it gives me joy!

653
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:36,108
Would you rather lie around doing nothing?
Or would you rather feel alive?

654
01:03:36,478 --> 01:03:39,072
Which is more fun?

655
01:06:07,195 --> 01:06:08,685
She sure can swim!

656
01:06:08,797 --> 01:06:12,528
She wanted to go to the Olympics
till she was about 15.

657
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:13,965
Had a coach and all.

658
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:17,197
Come to think of it,
I remember her winning something.

659
01:06:17,305 --> 01:06:19,398
Bronze at the Kinki Races.

660
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,870
Stopped when her boobs got bigger.

661
01:06:22,978 --> 01:06:25,742
No kidding! Gotta go with the flow, huh?

662
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:28,475
Yeah, with the flow.

663
01:06:31,152 --> 01:06:32,483
How is it?

664
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:38,085
Wow! Fantastic!

665
01:06:38,193 --> 01:06:41,492
Right, my turn!
Quality entertainment coming up!

666
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:02,375
Got one!

667
01:07:02,484 --> 01:07:04,452
Nishi!

668
01:08:41,483 --> 01:08:45,078
Nishi, remember when we found a stray dog?

669
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:46,920
In kindergarten?

670
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:50,286
And you said you'd take care of it?

671
01:08:50,825 --> 01:08:53,350
That made me so happy.

672
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:54,928
Yeah?

673
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:58,522
I'm gonna take him home with me.

674
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,460
You will? Thank you!

675
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:05,027
I already have a sea-monkey, so it'll be fine.

676
01:09:06,508 --> 01:09:10,672
Wanna see? C'mon, I'll show ya!

677
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:12,440
Myon.

678
01:09:13,681 --> 01:09:15,581
So this is the new plot.

679
01:09:16,384 --> 01:09:18,215
In the far, distant future,

680
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,813
where the world is starving from
over-population and environmental destruction,

681
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:27,789
Earth decides to send
a spaceship in search for food.

682
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:33,533
But something goes wrong.

683
01:09:36,204 --> 01:09:38,195
They land on a strange planet.

684
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:43,039
There's water and oxygen,
but nothing edible for humans.

685
01:09:46,548 --> 01:09:49,210
Except for one thing, they soon discover.

686
01:09:54,556 --> 01:09:57,616
A certain creature's pooh.

687
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,125
Ooh, gross!

688
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:03,665
And it's the perfect food for humans.

689
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:04,893
<i>"It's delicious! "
And it's the perfect food for humans.</i>

690
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:10,632
But the creature's unbelievably bad at hunting
and on the verge of extinction.

691
01:10:10,805 --> 01:10:12,329
There's only one?

692
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:17,338
Our men help the creature hunt, look after it.

693
01:10:17,845 --> 01:10:22,544
And they live like that for a while
until a new enemy arrives.

694
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:28,386
Higher species of plants begin to fight
for food, which is also creature chips.

695
01:10:28,489 --> 01:10:30,320
A pooh-war, huh?

696
01:10:30,858 --> 01:10:33,918
But what happens then? The crew?

697
01:10:35,897 --> 01:10:39,025
Guess we need to send them home safely, huh?

698
01:10:39,534 --> 01:10:42,992
The planet is ideal in its own way, but...

699
01:10:44,505 --> 01:10:48,703
In fact, the planet's some kind of cell.

700
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:52,405
Our crew must've ended up there
after being shrunk.

701
01:10:52,513 --> 01:10:53,707
A cell?

702
01:10:53,815 --> 01:10:55,942
Yeah, of a human body.

703
01:10:56,050 --> 01:10:57,210
Whose?

704
01:10:57,585 --> 01:10:58,244
Yours!

705
01:10:58,353 --> 01:10:59,650
Mine?

706
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:04,381
Let's just say... it was the leader's fault.

707
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:10,522
His love for his girl,
his determination to find that planet,

708
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:13,760
his desperation led the ship there.

709
01:11:14,669 --> 01:11:19,265
But one day, they realize
their bodies have grown bigger.

710
01:11:19,374 --> 01:11:20,636
Why?

711
01:11:20,775 --> 01:11:22,106
Wonder why.

712
01:11:23,878 --> 01:11:28,212
And they hear a voice. From inside your tummy
as you're sitting in the toilet.

713
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:31,615
"Oh my God!
We're growing bigger and bigger!"

714
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:33,550
Yikes!

715
01:11:33,655 --> 01:11:38,251
But they can communicate that way.
And they realize their inside your stomach.

716
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:39,621
- Then what?
- They've gotta get out.

717
01:11:39,727 --> 01:11:42,457
- From where?
- At this point, they're moving along the colon.

718
01:11:42,563 --> 01:11:43,791
Not happening!!

719
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:47,364
But what else can they do?
They keep getting bigger.

720
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:48,693
Your belly'll explode.

721
01:11:48,803 --> 01:11:51,738
- I said no!
- "We're almost out, don't flush us!"

722
01:11:51,839 --> 01:11:53,363
I AM flushing them!

723
01:11:53,841 --> 01:11:55,809
"We're out! We're out!"

724
01:11:56,711 --> 01:11:58,235
NO!!!

725
01:13:44,986 --> 01:13:46,681
Myon!

726
01:13:46,788 --> 01:13:48,483

727
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:52,355

728
01:13:52,794 --> 01:13:54,091

729
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:55,822
You guys OK?

730
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,557
A-OK!

731
01:13:58,065 --> 01:14:02,502
I'm relieved! We were worried!

732
01:14:02,603 --> 01:14:06,004
That was a surprise attack. So sudden.

733
01:14:24,058 --> 01:14:28,552
Told ya so! It's wicked, man!
A miracle, I say!

The guy's a fucking genius!

735
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,496

737
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:42,138

760
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:03,012
Hiroshi, kids shouldn't worry
about things like that.

784
01:20:44,871 --> 01:20:47,965
The water level's increasing.

785
01:20:48,808 --> 01:20:51,936
And he's eating less.

786
01:20:52,378 --> 01:20:53,743
Meaning?

787
01:20:55,882 --> 01:21:00,114
Can't say for sure, but he could be dying.

788
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,952
Dying? But what happens to us then?

789
01:21:05,358 --> 01:21:07,883
Eventually, this place'll sink.

But how?

792
01:21:15,768 --> 01:21:17,531
The boat, of course.

793
01:21:17,637 --> 01:21:20,470
- The cops'll be looking for us.
- So?

794
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:23,041
The Yakuzas'll come after us!

795
01:21:23,142 --> 01:21:25,736

Incredibly good guys, bad guys...

799
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:38,481
Folks completely different from us.
It's one huge melting pot!

800
01:21:38,891 --> 01:21:43,225
See, it's not about success,
dying in the streets, who's better, who's not.

801
01:21:43,329 --> 01:21:45,559
I just want to be a part of it!

802
01:21:45,798 --> 01:21:49,290
I realized that even if I've no connections,
no talent,

803
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:51,403
even if I'm one big loser,

804
01:21:51,504 --> 01:21:56,237
I want to use my hands and feet to think
and move, to shape my own life!

805

807
01:22:06,619 --> 01:22:11,022
It's impossible.
Motivation's not gonna get us over that wave.

808
01:22:11,457 --> 01:22:13,186
We need a motor boat.

809
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:18,256
We've got a motor!

810
01:22:18,498 --> 01:22:19,897
Right here!

811
01:22:22,735 --> 01:22:24,202
But there's no fuel...

812
01:22:25,238 --> 01:22:29,174
Sure there is!
We came here by car, remember?

813
01:22:34,881 --> 01:22:35,540
Yes!

814
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,478
It could work!

815
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:37,879
It will work!!

816
01:22:41,988 --> 01:22:44,388
We're going to make it!

817
01:22:44,957 --> 01:22:46,891
We're so gonna make it!

818
01:22:47,894 --> 01:22:49,191

826
01:24:40,806 --> 01:24:43,798

827
01:24:44,143 --> 01:24:45,440

Yang.

829
01:24:46,546 --> 01:24:49,447
Don't run like that, Myon'll follow you.

830
01:24:49,549 --> 01:24:51,278
Sorry, Myon...

831
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:55,411
I don't like that uniform!

832
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:57,689
- I'll work.
- Sorry Yang.

01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:06,256

all the load anymore.

01:29:18,851 --> 01:29:21,376
Ah, not again.

852
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:24,148
I'll put it in your food then.

853
01:33:18,223 --> 01:33:20,623
