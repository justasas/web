Some couples like to talk.

11
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:27,343
Did they see anything?

12
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:30,555
They don't know the girls,
didn't see the car. Nothing.

13
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:38,103

do we have left to cover?

we need to check these two roads

Harris wants us back to base
by midnight, so...

17
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:51,491
Maybe the perimeter's
not wide enough. Maybe...

00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:53,492
This guy's a traveler.

19
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:56,704

is throwing us off.

and an academy course to prep.

- On the drive home.

That's right.
On the drive home.

- Sir, we didn't...
- Shut up.

Two cars out front.
4 place settings, not 3.

71
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:14,508
All should have alerted you
to the possibility

72
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,094
that there might be
another suspect.

73
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:20,097
- I think...
- I'm sorry? What?

74
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:23,099
What did you say?

75
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:27,061
I think you enjoy
watching us fail, sir.

76
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,188
Better in here than out there.

77
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,690
You know this really happened?

78
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,858
The UNSUB was apprehended
in under 2 minutes

79
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,610
without a shot fired.

80
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,613
It took you guys 7 minutes,
and you killed your partner.

Have some cake.

82
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:43,994
The majority of murders
are committed

83
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:45,745
by someone known to the victim.

84
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:49,415
Those that are not solved within
the first 48 hours seldom are.

85
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:50,958
Not so with serial killers.

86
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,460
One advantage
in this line of work

87
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:55,504
is knowing that as long as
the UNSUB is out there,

88
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,256
you'll always have
another chance.

89
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,716
With each new killing comes
a resetting of the clock.

90
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,385
Time is on your side.

91
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,719
The model for this exercise

92
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:06,097
was a missing-persons search
in Buffalo, 1982.

93
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:09,434
The dead man was an accomplice
who was killed the day before.

94
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,310
The killer staged a suicide

95
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:14,063
in order to try, in effect,
an escape.

96
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:18,650
As you can see, some of you
responded better than others.

97
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,819
Well, exactly how many times
has a profiler

98
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:23,947
been in a kill-or-capture
situation since 1982?

99
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:25,949
Are you suggesting I'm
preparing you for something

100
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,992
you may never experience?

101
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:29,952
Success comes
when you understand

102
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:32,330
that your most lethal weapon
isn't your firearm,

103
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,540
but your brain.

104
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,709
A lot of the old guard
don't believe in my methods.

105
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,502
A lot of them think I'm crazy.

106
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:41,088
You're a privileged group.

107
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:43,340
You're all smart
or you wouldn't be here.

108
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:45,884
I just want you to be smarter.

109
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:49,637
Our final exercise will be
on the island of Oneiga.

110
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,683
This simulation will be a test
primarily of your teamwork.

111
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,685
I hope you're ready.

112
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,897
Then how could we have saved
the girls at the old hotel?

113
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,400
You couldn't. They were dead
no matter what you did.

114
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:06,069
What's the point
if we couldn't have saved them?

115
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:09,405
The point is to get used to it.

116
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,743
? There, you've seen it,
my behavior's unacceptable ?

117
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,203
Good evening, my fine,
young FBI friends.

118
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:20,499

My parents are loaded
as per my expensive ensemble.

121
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:30,591
And that "J"...Where is it?
On my key ring...

122
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:34,220
means I'm either a Jill
or a Jennifer.

123

Those being the favorite "J"
names of Beltway parents

124
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:39,016
circa 1981.

125
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:41,560
I like to hang with my friends
and have a good time,

126
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,939
but I'm really just a mature
woman looking for a mature man.

127
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,566
And I recently quit smoking.

128
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,152
[English accent]
Why do you say that?

129
00:11:51,152 --> 00:11:53,571
You see the way she keeps eyeing
the guy next to her?

130
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,698
It's not him.
It's his cigarette.

131
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,366
Spoken like a woman who knows.

132
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:59,118
How long has it been, Nicole?
3 days?

133
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,119
The lovely Nicole
and her personal demons.

134
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:04,956
I'm surprised there's enough
room at the table for all of us.

135
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:07,667
Take me 5 minutes
to get her number.

136
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,585
Take me 2.

137
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,129
- You're on.
- Money's coming out.

138
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,255
$20.

139
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:15,216
- $20 works.
- Whoo!

140
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:16,592
Whoa, big money.

141
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:21,346
Hi. I think I know you,
don't I?

142
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:22,848
You're, um, uh...

143
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,307
Jill, right?

144
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:25,350
Jen.

145
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:28,186
Jen, Jen. Yes.
Yes, Jen, of course.

146
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,313
Okay, obviously
you don't remember me.

147
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,690
My name's Bobby.
Bobby Whitman.

148

Rafe, you're up.
Profile.

149
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,110
Okay.

Black suit, blond hair,
Martini.

young things.

153
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,743
Preferably blond.

154
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:48,496
Preferably a cheerleader
with great big...

155
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,873
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Enough.

156
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,709
Right about the blond.
You're on fire.

157
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,461
You're projecting.

158
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:00,215
I don't know. It was 2 seconds
at a lecture last semester.

159
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,383
GMU Lit Department, right?

160
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,552
The Moody lecture?

161
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:05,136
Yeah, yeah, Moody.
Heck of a writer.

162
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,346
Um...

163
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,556
I'm actually not even
a student myself.

164
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,099
Um...

165
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,810
I work in finance.

166
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,937
Oh. Finance?

167
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:18,107
- Oh! Right. Bobby.
- Yeah.

168
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:20,317
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

169

He's got 15 seconds.

170
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:26,531
Thank you.

171
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,117
Lucas, looks like tonight
wasrt your night.

172
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,661
I know her. Her name's Jen.
I told her to play along.

173
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,870
You're full of shit.

174
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,288
You never know.

175
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,789
ALL: Ooh.

176
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,499
Ooh.

177
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,709
[Laughter]

178
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:44,547
So, what is going on
in that head?

179
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:45,757
We're professionals.

180
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,800
We shouldn't have to put up
with Harris' shit.

181
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:50,303
All right, what's up?

182
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:54,682
I'm not making profiler.

183
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:56,100
I was alone in his office.

184
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:59,937
His recommends were on the desk,
and I read them.

185
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:02,064
We still have the weekend
at Oneiga.

186
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,482
He says I'm unfocused.

187
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:04,649
He says I'm not capable

188
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:08,486
of the psychological commitment
necessary for profiling work.

189
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:10,196
How do you like that?

190
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:13,407
Commitment. Like,
"Fucking look at me, man."

191
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:15,409
Vince, I think...

192
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,245
You're not making profiler
either, Sara.

193
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:22,749
Sorry.
I read it.

194
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,544
Don't work too hard
out there, okay?

195
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:38,889
We've got a late addition.

196
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:41,308
This is Detective Gabe Jenson.

197
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:43,185
He's from the Philadelphia P.D.

198
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,686
Good morning.
How you doir?

199
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,396
He's their resident profiler,

200
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:48,147
and somehow he got
on D.O.J.'s good side

201
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:50,566
and convinced the attorney
general he could sit in

202
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,235
on some exercises
and see how I work.

203
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,362
Do I have the politics
about right?

204
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:56,614
Something like that.

205
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:57,906
He's joining the team?

206
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,701
He's just here to observe,
not to participate.

207
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:02,702
Now, be nice to him
or it's my ass.

208
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:03,995
No offense, Detective.

209
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:06,581
None taken. It's an honor
to meet all of you.

210
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,889
You want to do hostage rescue,
a smallpox outbreak,

211
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,349
this is the place.

212
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:31,437
Navy Seas built it
for war-game practice.

213
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:34,482
Once a year, they turn it over
to me for the weekend.

214
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:40,737
Okay, get your rappelling lines
and prepare to drop.

215
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:43,949
That's a joke.

216
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,713
Here we are.
Crimetown, USA.

217
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:01,840
Where all the residents
are dead.

218
00:16:01,882 --> 00:16:03,717
Or about to be.

219
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:07,095
Now, the idea here, people,
is to only kill the bad guys.

220
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:08,805
[Beeping]

221
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:09,847
But nobody's perfect.

222
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,683
It's nice
to hear you say that, sir.

223
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,852
RAFE: It's like Beirut
meets Belfast.

224
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:18,063
Sir, I thought they didn't let
foreign nationals in the FBI.

225
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,691
Don't worry. On the inside
he's 100% American, right?

226
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:23,235
As American
as the death penalty.

227
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,361
HARRIS:
That's my boy.

228
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:26,446
I think I'm in love.

229
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:31,784
Oh, there is one other person.
They'll be coming along shortly.

230
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:32,952
Who's that?

231
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:35,287
He's called a puppeteer.

232
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,539
He's killed two people
on these streets,

233
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,416
and he's about to kill a third.

234
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,084
Tomorrow you'll find
the crime scene

235
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,711
and receive
your background dossiers.

236
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:47,006
By 0800 on Monday, I want
a full profile of this suspect.

237
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,050
I want to know who he is,
what he does,

238
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,010
and where he's gonna do it next.

239
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,846
I'm asking Special Agent Reston
to be team leader

240
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,556
unless you'd like to defer.

241
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,390
No, Harris.

242
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,601
I will solve whatever sick,
twisted crime scenario

243
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,727
you come up with.

244
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:01,937
I hope so.

245
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,690
What's the tank for?

246
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,484
The Navy uses it
to simulate Arctic regions.

247
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:11,154
That's what the nitrogers for.

248
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:14,657
In general, if it says
"military," don't touch it.

249
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:17,701
Oh.
Great.

250
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,495
Navy humor.

251
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,085
The computers are loaded
with ViCAP,

252
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,461
but they're fully firewalled.

253
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:31,339
Don't do any research offsite.

254
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:35,384
If you want to do any
blood samples on the autorad,

255
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:38,470
analyze fibers...
scout samples...

256
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,931
- [Buzzing]
- It's all here.

257
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:45,101
You'll rest up here
till the morning.

258
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:47,520
Downstairs, there's
a fully stocked freezer,

259
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,355
bunks, and your showers.

260
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:51,482
Don't forget.
You're 50 miles offshore.

261
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:55,152
If you run out of toilet paper,
you are shit out of luck.

262
00:17:55,236 --> 00:17:56,695
So, what's the point?

263
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:57,780
Sorry, Detective?

264
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:00,115
The island, the middle of
nowhere, they're professionals.

265
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:01,158
What's the point?

266
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:06,037
The point is that they're
isolated, alone, and forgotten.

267
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,791
That's what it's like to be
inside the mind of a sociopath.

268
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:13,836
Have you noticed it's
a really bad feeling here?

269
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:21,301
Good luck on your profile.

270
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:46,866

What?

280
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,350
He said dress for an island.

281
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,604
J. D:
So, Detective,

282
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:22,107
what exactly did you do to earn
this island paradise?

283
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,192
Recommended for it.
Same as you.

284
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,235
Why, though?

285
00:19:25,318 --> 00:19:27,570
Did you catch some killer
in Philly or something?

286
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:28,905
What's the deal?

287
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,449
You don't want to know
my war stories.

288
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:33,409
Well, actually, I do.

289
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:35,202
I mean, right now,

290
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:37,705
what do we know
about you for real?

291
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,957
We know he's got resentments
toward his parents,

292
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:43,293
as per the overload on tattoos
he's got there.

293
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:45,587
We know he's just out
of a bad relationship.

294
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:47,755
He's barely looked twice
at me and Sara.

295
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,341
Maybe you're not my type,
Nicole.

296
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:52,093
We're alone on an island.

297
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:54,512
Trust me, I'm your type.

298
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:58,515
We also know
he watches his words.

299
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:02,102
So that crossword's either
a sign of honing a talent

300
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:03,520
or correcting a deficiency.

301
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,480
What you say about me
doesn't tell you about me.

302
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,857
It tells me about you.

303
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,693
Now, I could say
your little gambling

304
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:13,070
means you have
an addictive personality.

305
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,196
I could say I know

you're sleeping with one
of the guys in this room.

307
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,117
I could say you take charge
of your team

308
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,995
because you never had a leader
in your own life.

309
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,330
And you.

310
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,332
When push comes to shove,
you crack under pressure.

311
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,960
Your partners can't depend
on you.

You don't belong here.

313
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:33,089

to feed the ducks.

323

I see you're feeding the ducks.

324
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,088
Maybe we could feed the ducks
together.

325
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:20,507
Leave you alone?

326
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:22,092
No, no.
It's all right.

It's a gesture.

Goodwill, sympathy.
You know, the usual.

330

In lieu of knowing
what's going on.

331
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:41,902
He's not gonna let me
make profiler.

332
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:45,905
He thinks I can't get past it.

333
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:47,240
Is he right?

334
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,043

337
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,259
So I grew up living real hard.

You don't confront your demons
and defeat them.

344
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,364
You confront them.

345
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:32,907
Then you confront them.

346
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:35,743
Then you confront them
some more.

00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:24,496
You only want me for my mind.

355
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:41,386
[Breathing heavily]

356
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:09,495
[Yowling]

357
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,247
[Grunting]

358
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:15,209
[Yowling]

359
00:24:17,252 --> 00:24:18,962
[Groans]

360
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:22,799
[Bell clanging]

361
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:52,994
[Screams]

362
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:02,419
NICOLE:
What happened?

363
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,846
I'd like to know
how Harris got it here.

364
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,515
I'd say the issue is "why?"

365
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,853
Here, kitty kitty.

366
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,066
What kind of simulation is this?

367
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,989
Ah. Oh!

368
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:35,658
Ugh.

369
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:37,117
10:00.

370
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:41,246
That supposed to mean something?

371
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,749
So, what, is this supposed to be
some kind of warning sign?

372
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:49,087
Well, if I know Harris,
it's a sign of something.

373
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:55,801
It's 9:30 A.M.,
Saturday morning.

374
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:58,303
We're in search
of an unknown crime scene.

375
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,014
We'll split into pairs.

376
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:04,517
The first one who finds it wins
my eternal love and devotion.

377
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,061
And a dead cat.

378
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:07,270
[Cat yowls]

379
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:09,063
And a dead cat.

380
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:12,900
[Bell rings]

381
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:16,195
Now, this place
must remind you of home.

382
00:26:16,237 --> 00:26:19,198
Ha.
Happytown, USA.

383
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,407
Sst!

384
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,492
Look.

385
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:27,539
It's little Bobby.

386
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:31,042
Little Bobby's gonna grow up
to be big and strong

387
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,210
and pursue a career
in buried children

388
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:35,045
and dismembered mummies.

389
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:38,507
Now, that will make
Happytown proud.

390
00:26:38,507 --> 00:26:41,051
I think you're
in the wrong line of work.

391
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,056
No, mate.

392
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:49,100
Not me.

393
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,436
Hey!

394
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:56,857
Dinner at Harris' house.

395
00:26:56,857 --> 00:26:58,400
Pass the nuts.

396
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:03,905
Charming.

397
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,036
Great.
A cigarette machine.

398
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,288
Temptation is everywhere.

399
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:16,292
Hey, Agent, we searching
together or what?

400
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,086
Suit yourself.
I'm on vacation.

401
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:22,089
Hey, Vince!

402
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:24,090
Check out
the other side of town.

403
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,509
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,469
Huh.

405
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:35,392
Hey, everybody!

406
00:27:39,313 --> 00:27:42,107
Harris, you are one sick
son of a bitch.

407
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,734
Stay on my 6.

408
00:27:44,818 --> 00:27:47,987
Okay, everybody, it's about
that time to look alive.

409
00:27:48,112 --> 00:27:51,741
We have victim.

410
00:27:51,866 --> 00:27:53,868
Or victims?

411
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:58,247
We got a single victim.
Caucasian female.

412
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:00,249
25, 26.

413
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,835
The puppeteer.
That's a hell of a signature.

414
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:09,215
Why don't you check
the employee logs, receipts?

415
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:12,468
See who shopped here, who
worked here. That sort of thing.

416
00:28:12,468 --> 00:28:14,845
Let me run forensic,
work the timeline.

417
00:28:14,845 --> 00:28:16,930
Sara, why don't you check
the carcass?

418
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,183
Sara!

419
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,183
Sure.

420
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:24,562
Oh.

421
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:27,815
There's splatter
behind the counter.

422
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:30,193
The girl was definitely moved.

423
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:32,194
Any venture as to weapon?

424
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,488
- You want to take point on M.O.?
- Absolutely.

425
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:36,699
Nic, not to step on your toes,

426
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,035
but I'm gonna bet
the guy's a trophy taker.

427
00:28:54,006 --> 00:28:55,466
What are you smiling about?

428
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:57,968
If the taxpayers only knew...

429
00:28:57,968 --> 00:29:00,512
I think I'll go see if the
UNSUB's still in the building.

430
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:03,139
Sweetheart, it's just
a simulation, yeah?

431
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:06,935
Where we're from, a site search
is called procedure.

432
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:08,519
Yeah?

433
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:14,483
We should have been allowed
to bring our guns.

434
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,318
It doesn't feel real
without my gun.

435
00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:18,904
Hell, Vince,
how real do you want it?

436
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,281
# Welcome to puppet... #

437
00:29:21,448 --> 00:29:23,116
Don't move.
Don't move! Sara.

438
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:26,453
# Pull my strings,
it's time to play #

439
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:28,538
Let's see what freak show
Harris has in mind.

440
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:31,666
# Surprises
at puppet playtime #

441
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,584
It's no fun unless
it's a challenge, right?

442
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:37,755
# Hope you all enjoy
your stay #

443
00:29:37,796 --> 00:29:40,382
# Welcome to puppet... #

444
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:42,384
[Music stops]

445
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:16,248
Move!

446
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,333
Aah.

447
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:20,002
Aah!

448
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,294
My legs!

449
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:24,089
No!
Don't touch it!

450
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,131
Help!

451
00:30:25,215 --> 00:30:26,549
It'll burn you!

452
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:28,343
- They're frozen!
- Help him!

453
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:30,136
Aah!
Aah!

454
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:32,930
Aah!
Stop!

455
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,481
[Cracking]

456
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,234
[Breathing heavily]

457
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:54,867
This is a joke, right?

458
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:57,494
That was just a simulation.

459
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:04,042
[Crying]

460
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:43,161
I'm sorry, Nic.

461
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:52,920
- Were they working before?
- No signal, nothing.

462
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,964
What if it was
some kind of accident?

463
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:57,299
Someone killed J.D.
Don't you get it?

464
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,719
Someone is here on this island.

465
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:04,264
That wasrt there
last night either.

466
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:12,146
12:00.

467
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:13,606
It's an hour and a half.

468
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:15,608
It's a message.

469
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:19,820
What about the boat?

470
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:23,365
We saw that pier with the boat
when we flew in.

471
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:25,408
Watch your backs
and everyone else's.

472
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:26,951
Hit the boat and find the radio.

473
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:29,495
The simulatiors over.

474
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:43,967
Now is not the time for fear,
people.

475
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:47,011
- Now is the ti...
- [Beeping]

476
00:32:48,054 --> 00:32:49,305
Shit.

477
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:07,280
- Sara!
- Ohh!

478
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:10,533
Sara!

479
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,493
Get her out of the water!

480
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,803
[Both gasping]

481
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,347
Help me get her
out of the water!

482
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,351
Get her out of the water!

483
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,186
Ugh!

484
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,355
It's okay.
You're okay.

485
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,939
Aah!

486
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,691
I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.

487
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,817
I've got her.

488
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,319
Back the fuck off!
I'll handle it!

489
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,409
It's okay.

490
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,120
You're out of the water,
all right? You're out.

491
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:01,496
Aah!

492
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:05,000
All right.
You're out of the water.

493
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:08,836
- You're okay.
- What's her thing with water?

494
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:13,049
I think I lost my smokes.

495
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:17,469
Harris brought us
to this island.

496
00:34:17,553 --> 00:34:20,514
Now we're not allowed to leave.

497
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:23,183
- Let's talk about this Harris.
- [Coughing]

498
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:25,185
Harris wouldn't do this.

499
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:27,604
You can say what you want,
but Harris is a company man.

500
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:31,065
Did anyone actually see him
get back in that chopper?

501
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:32,900
Oh, tell me
somebody witnessed that.

502
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,361
Maybe he got tired
of the simulations.

503
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:37,905
Missed the taste
of the real thing.

504
00:34:39,865 --> 00:34:42,117
I'll give him a taste
of the real thing.

505
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,452
Did he just pull
that gun out of his arse?

506
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:48,039
We werert supposed to
bring weapons.

507
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:49,916
My gun goes where I go.

508
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:52,793
If you get shot sometime,
maybe you'll understand.

509
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:55,421
You shouldn't have brought
your weapon, Vince.

510
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,215
You're gonna be glad I did.

511
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:10,143
Two square miles at most.

512
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:13,020
Hey.
Check this out.

513
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,732
Who wants to play
some hide-and-seek?

514
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,902
Anyone else is on this island,

515
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,988
Harris or worse,
we're gonna find them.

516
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:26,032
How's about your Navy?

517
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:28,242
They don't muck around, do they?

518
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,420
GABE:
Damn cats.

519
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:48,970
[Thunder crashes]

520
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:07,904
Aah! Aah!

521
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:10,948
Oh, for the love of God,
just take the arm.

522
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,996
There. There.
That's the Lucas I know.

523
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:20,165
You want to get up
and do it all over again.

524
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:22,209
Are you all right?

525
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:23,543
Yeah.
I told you I'm fine.

526
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:25,086
Yeah, you told me, but...

527
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,130
As long as people aren't
asking me if I'm all right,

528
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,965
I'm all right.

529
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,593
So can I ask you
something else, then?

530
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:35,512
Anything else.

531
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:37,931
Well, since the end
may be near here,

532
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:41,268
have you kind of always
sort of had a thing for me?

533
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:47,148
Aah!

534
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,442
[Laughs]

535
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,235
Is that a no?

536
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:56,115
20 minutes of 12:00.

537
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,626
So at 12:00
someone else is killed?

538
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:11,295
Somebody left those watches.

539
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:13,089
And left them
after Harris had gone.

540
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:15,591
Where is this killer?
We searched the island.

541
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:17,760
Somebody set that trap.

542
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:19,219
Somebody rigged that boat.

543
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,680
So what are we saying?

544
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,431
This is some kind of game?

545
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:26,810
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

546
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:29,062
Who's the next motherfucker
to go?

547
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,190
It's 12:00.

548
00:37:33,232 --> 00:37:34,984
It's 12:00,
and we're still here!

549
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:37,194
We're still here,
and it's 12:00, and...

550
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:39,196
Shut up, Vince.

551
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:40,781
All right. Look.

552
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:43,158
We know that there
is a killer on the island.

553
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,368
Someone who knows
what we're here for,

554
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:46,953
someone who knows where we'd be.

555
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:48,955
There's just one problem.

556
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:52,291
There's no one
on the island but us.

557
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:58,881
Now, hold on.

558
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,383
Real slow.

559
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:03,468
Real easy like.

560
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:07,138
Let's all move our hands
away from our weapons.

561
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,432
- You get on the ground.
- Lucas.

562
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,019
I'm checking the rooms.
I find this... by his bed.

563
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,230
It's maps of the island,
the building, everything here.

564
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:17,981
Been doing some research
on the place?

565
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:20,901
- I can goddamn explain.
- You can get on the ground!

566
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:24,362
This is a military facility!
No one has access to this stuff!

567
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:26,156
- [Guns cocking]
- Whoa.

568
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:33,371
You got me all wrong.

569
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:35,497
Oh, yeah, Detective?
They your maps?

570
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:38,917
I want to see
your hands up. Up!

571
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,044
You believe me.

572
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,464
- No one leaves this room.
- Since when is this room safe?

573
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:45,882
Since we're all in it.

574
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:47,842
On your knees now.

575
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:50,052
Now! Down!

576
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,856
Sara, can you feel your face?

577
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:05,734
Because I can't feel
your face...

578
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:11,906
Coffee.

579
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:13,532
Huh?

580
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,534
There's something in the coffee.

581
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:18,120
- Ohh!
- [Cup shatters]

582
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:19,913
Ohh.

583
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:21,790
[Cup shatters]

584
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:23,041
Ohh!

585
00:39:24,084 --> 00:39:25,251
SARA:
Hey, Nic...

586
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:29,005
Stay... away from...

587
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:31,632
[Speaking indistinctly]

588
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:33,217
[Cup shatters]

589
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:25,515
[Beeps]

590
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,692
[Meows]

591
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:50,037
- [Grunts]
- You going somewhere?

592
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,206
Come here.

593
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:54,083
Sit down.

594
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,335
- Hey, man, I can explain.
- Shut up.

595
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:58,420
- Listen, I can explain.
- I said shut up!

596
00:40:58,504 --> 00:40:59,963
You don't know
what you're doing.

597
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:01,131
You don't know who I am.

598
00:41:01,131 --> 00:41:03,717
I know you killed J.D.
That's what I know.

599
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:05,301
Is everybody all right?

600
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:06,761
Sara.

601
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:08,012
Sara.

602
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:12,308
Hey. Hey.
Sara.

603
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:14,560
Sara? Hey.

604
00:41:14,643 --> 00:41:17,479
[Breathing heavily]

605
00:41:19,898 --> 00:41:23,235
I just had the worst dream ever.

606
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:24,944
Come on.

607
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,696
Look.

608
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:29,866
If I'm the killer,
why didn't I run?

609
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:34,036
You were all lying here.
How come so am I?

610
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,206
Maybe it's a trick so you
can finish what you started!

611
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,333
Look, I'll tell you why
the maps were in the bedroom.

612
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,501
No! You tell us
what you put in the coffee!

613
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,713
- That's what you tell us.
- Hey! Who made it?

614
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,340
Did I make the coffee?

615
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:49,509
Sherlock Holmes
over there made it.

616
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,344
The man is calling you a killer.

617
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:54,096
Personally, I think you might
want to defend yourself.

618
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,890
Aah! Aah! Aah!

619
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,893
Oh, fuck!
Ohh!

620
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:04,064
[Whimpers]
Oh, fuck!

621
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,357
There's...

622
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,817
There's no blood.

623
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,569
Somebody...

624
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,821
drained his blood.

625
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,718
LUCAS:
6:00.

626
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:37,761
Two watches.

627
00:42:37,845 --> 00:42:41,306
Two watches means two victims?

628
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,309
We got 20 minutes.

629
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:46,269
All right.

630
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:47,645
[Grunting]

631
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:51,232
Right. I want to know what
the next trap is.

632
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:53,192
And I want to know now.

633
00:42:53,234 --> 00:42:55,653
I can't tell you
because I don't know!

634
00:42:55,736 --> 00:42:57,654
You've been lying to us
since we got here.

635
00:42:57,738 --> 00:42:59,364
That doesn't make me
the killer.

636
00:42:59,406 --> 00:43:01,908
The dead people does.

637
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:04,286
How about the Ioner mentality?

638
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:06,204
How about the issues
with the FBI?

639
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:07,330
I'm not a cop.

640
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,540
I'm an investigator
with the Department of Justice.

641
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:12,168
I was sent to
investigate Harris.

642
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:14,712
The attorney general was hearing
rumors about his methods.

643
00:43:14,712 --> 00:43:17,297
There was talk he was
pushing trainees too far.

644
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:19,716
The FBI investigates the FBI.

645
00:43:19,716 --> 00:43:21,510
Not if you want it done right.

646
00:43:21,551 --> 00:43:23,720
Look, they took him out
of the field for a reason.

647
00:43:23,845 --> 00:43:25,638
Justice was talking
maybe that wasrt enough.

648
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,307
They sent me to see
how he works you.

649
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,684
The maps were prep.
It's a job!

650
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,269
Oh, this is not happening.

651
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,605
You want to hook me up to
a polygraph, hook me up!

652
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:36,607
Yeah, we know how to beat
a polygraph, too.

653
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:39,401
He's lying.
Watch his eyes.

654
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:43,446
I'm not lying.
I just don't like you.

655
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:46,950
Okay.
You got 15 minutes.

656
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,493
So tell us where the trap is,

657
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:51,162
or you never leave this room,
and I mean never.

658
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:52,538
Don't take your eyes off of him.

659
00:43:52,705 --> 00:43:54,290
Okay.

660
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,749
[Door closes]

661
00:43:57,709 --> 00:43:59,753
Now, start talking.

662
00:44:03,632 --> 00:44:05,842
It's a nine-number sequence
repeating itself.

663
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:07,468
Nine permutations.

664
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,053
What? A code?
A combination?

665
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:11,264
It has something to do
with time!

666
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:13,015
He has an obsession with time!

667
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:14,850
Forget the numbers.
We need to find the trap.

668
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:16,393
The numbers are the message.

669
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:18,562
What if it tells us
where the trap might be?

670
00:44:18,562 --> 00:44:20,314
Fine. Bobby,
help her work the numbers.

671
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:22,065
I'm searching the building.

672
00:44:22,149 --> 00:44:23,817
I'm searching with you.

673
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,110
[Sighs]

674
00:44:26,569 --> 00:44:27,654
10 minutes.

675
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:48,506
Phone number, Social Security
number, coordinates.

676
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:50,633
- Talk to me!
- Seven minutes.

677
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:53,803
Between you and me...

678
00:44:55,054 --> 00:44:57,056
I'm not a violent person.

679
00:44:57,139 --> 00:44:59,558
The thing I've learned
in my life is this.

680
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:02,394
Sometimes if you find yourself
feeling deep anger

681
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:03,770
and frustration

682
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:07,565
about where you find yourself,
what has happened to you...

683
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:11,360
The healthy thing to do
is to find an outlet

684
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:13,738
and let it all fucking go.

685
00:45:14,488 --> 00:45:15,990
6:00.

686
00:45:16,115 --> 00:45:19,117
One of us dies,
my outlet is you.

687
00:45:21,703 --> 00:45:22,829
[Beeps]

688
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,798
I am not your guy.

689
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,971
You don't want to do this, man.

690
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:44,432
You'll have to live
with what you don't know.

691
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,560
I think we're clear
on this level.

692
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:49,771
The obsession is time.
It has to do with time.

693
00:45:49,812 --> 00:45:51,105
I know it.

694
00:45:51,105 --> 00:45:54,066
5, 8, 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4.
What is it?

695
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:55,109
Sara, it's no use.

696
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,569
8, 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4, 5.

697
00:45:57,694 --> 00:45:58,695
- What is that?
- Sara...

698
00:45:58,695 --> 00:46:00,113
2, 9, 9, 7, 9...

699
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,450
It's a number!
It's a fucking number!

700
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:06,119
They're all just
fucking numbers!

701
00:46:17,546 --> 00:46:21,466
7, 9, 2... 4, 5, 8... 2, 7, 9.

702
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,761
Anybody? Anyone?
What are we thinking here?

703
00:46:24,803 --> 00:46:26,387
What about a rate?

704
00:46:26,513 --> 00:46:28,765
When you factor in time,
an amount becomes a rate.

705
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:29,766
Or a speed!

706
00:46:29,932 --> 00:46:31,892
Yes. What kind of speed
do you measure in the millions?

707
00:46:32,018 --> 00:46:34,520
Atoms? Electrons?
How the hell should I know?

708
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:36,689

This is the original

00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:49,617
And you know that?

713
00:46:49,659 --> 00:46:51,661
It's the basic principle

01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,388
Remotes.

1246
01:27:23,306 --> 01:27:24,432
But at the end of the day,

1247
01:27:24,516 --> 01:27:28,644
building a better mousetrap
is just pure mechanics.

1248
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:32,189
It's knowing how to bait
a particular mouse.

1249
01:27:32,231 --> 01:27:34,233
That's the fun part.

1250
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,609
[Gasps]

1251
01:27:35,693 --> 01:27:37,194
Ah, ah, ah-ah.

1252
01:27:46,744 --> 01:27:48,746
So there I was.

1253
01:27:48,913 --> 01:27:51,832
Sitting next to the bodies
of my parents.

1254
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:52,958
Just waiting for someone

1255
01:27:53,084 --> 01:27:55,461
to ask me
why I killed them, you know?

1256
01:27:55,502 --> 01:27:57,296
And this detective
comes up to me, right?

1257
01:27:57,463 --> 01:27:59,089
And he says...

1258
01:28:00,465 --> 01:28:01,883
"Want some gum?"

1259
01:28:03,093 --> 01:28:04,302
Gum.

1260
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:07,055
No one asks.

1261
01:28:07,096 --> 01:28:09,599
It never even occurs to them.

1262
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:13,102
And like after
every first high...

1263
01:28:13,185 --> 01:28:16,688
it's harder and harder
to get to that place.

1264
01:28:16,814 --> 01:28:20,317
And finally you get so good,
there's no feeling at all.

1265
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:21,818
It's easy.

1266
01:28:23,153 --> 01:28:25,655
Finding a won'thy prey.

1267
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:27,907
A challenge.

1268
01:28:27,949 --> 01:28:29,492
That's hard.

1269
01:28:30,701 --> 01:28:33,704
You joined the FBI for this?

1270
01:28:33,704 --> 01:28:35,080
Yeah.

1271
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:38,292
Yeah.

1272
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:40,919
So while you were studying
tired old hacks

1273
01:28:40,919 --> 01:28:43,630
like Bundy, Gacy, and Dahmer,

1274
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:45,548
I was studying you.

1275
01:28:45,632 --> 01:28:48,259
Your habits, your hang-ups,
your weaknesses.

1276
01:28:48,343 --> 01:28:51,012
It was so simple
to set you all on edge.

1277
01:28:53,431 --> 01:28:54,515
You know?

1278
01:28:54,598 --> 01:28:56,517
I had to push here...

1279
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,144
pull there...
but once I did...

1280
01:28:59,144 --> 01:29:01,605
LUCAS: Hey, Vince, check out
the other side of town.

1281
01:29:01,688 --> 01:29:03,940
I knew each of you
would play your part.

1282
01:29:06,734 --> 01:29:09,195
The key to effective illusion
is misdirection.

1283
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,530
You know there's a bomb
on the boat.

1284
01:29:10,696 --> 01:29:12,698
You don't run toward it
first in line.

1285
01:29:12,782 --> 01:29:14,116
You know?

1286
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:15,868
All I needed was opportunity.

1287
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:19,246
The coffee break gave me
the chance I needed

1288
01:29:19,246 --> 01:29:21,081
to rig a few little surprises.

1289
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,251
The answer was
in front of your eyes.

1290
01:29:25,335 --> 01:29:26,669
You still couldn't see it.

1291
01:29:26,711 --> 01:29:29,213
It was you who said
to turn off the water.

1292
01:29:29,255 --> 01:29:30,381
The rest was easy.

1293
01:29:30,464 --> 01:29:33,509
You're all
so fucking predictable.

1294
01:29:33,592 --> 01:29:35,010
Nicole with her cigarettes.

1295
01:29:35,094 --> 01:29:38,305
Can't she even read
the warning label on the box?

1296
01:29:39,014 --> 01:29:42,559
Vince...
"I'm never without my gun."

1297
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:45,895
Bobby the Magnificent
couldn't resist.

1298
01:29:45,895 --> 01:29:49,357
And Harris
just had to stay and watch.

1299
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:53,319
Party crasher here was more
of a problem than I thought,

1300
01:29:53,319 --> 01:29:56,864
but why am I gonna work
so hard to kill him

1301
01:29:56,905 --> 01:29:58,865
when I knew you'd do it for me?

1302
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:04,996
You see, the water
ain't your only weakness, Sara.

1303
01:30:05,038 --> 01:30:07,040
[Shuddering]

1304
01:30:09,292 --> 01:30:11,460
Your other weakness...

1305
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,003
is me.

1306
01:30:40,821 --> 01:30:43,114
In truth, I couldn't have
done it without you.

1307
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:45,116
As a sign of my appreciation,
I'm gonna grant you

1308
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,451
your deepest desire.

1309
01:30:46,534 --> 01:30:50,997
I'm gonna get you closer to your
sister than you ever imagined.

1310
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:57,794
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi.

1311
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:06,135
- Are we having fun yet?
- [Gasping]

1312
01:31:09,889 --> 01:31:11,015
Whoa.

1313
01:31:24,903 --> 01:31:26,654
[Chuckling]

1314
01:31:30,992 --> 01:31:32,660
[Gasps]

1315
01:33:03,535 --> 01:33:04,744
[Gasps]

1316
01:33:24,304 --> 01:33:25,597
Drop it!

1317
01:33:29,517 --> 01:33:31,811
Go ahead, Sara.
Arrest me.

1318
01:33:33,771 --> 01:33:36,940
We have your blood
under Rafe's fingernails.

1319
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:40,360
Your fingerprints
on the fire extinguisher.

1320
01:33:40,444 --> 01:33:42,946
And your bullet in my neck.

1321
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,157
That don't look good.

1322
01:33:47,742 --> 01:33:49,494
You're fucked.

1323
01:33:52,913 --> 01:33:54,331
[Ticking]

1324
01:33:54,999 --> 01:33:57,417
- [Gasps]
- Time's up, asshole.

1325
01:34:21,148 --> 01:34:23,441
Good thing you hit like a girl.

1326
01:34:31,907 --> 01:34:34,493
I guess we found out
his weakness.

1327
01:34:35,494 --> 01:34:37,287
Bullets.

1328
01:34:48,381 --> 01:34:50,299
[Helicopter blades whirring]

1329
01:35:05,897 --> 01:35:07,940
Do you think they'll let me
make profiler?

1330
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:11,402
That depends.
One last question.

1331
01:35:12,695 --> 01:35:16,281
Whers the situation secure,
Agent?

1332
01:35:17,116 --> 01:35:18,700
On the drive home.

1333
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,035
Yeah.

1334
01:35:20,911 --> 01:35:22,495
On the drive home.

1335
01:35:38,497 --> 01:35:43,797
