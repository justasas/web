Some couples like to talk.

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Did they see anything?

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,600
They don't know the girls,
didn't see the car. Nothing.

13
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,160

do we have left to cover?

we need to check these two roads

Harris wants us back to base
by midnight, so...

17
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,520
Maybe the perimeter's
not wide enough. Maybe...

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,520
This guy's a traveler.

19
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,760

is throwing us off.

and an academy course to prep.

- On the drive home.

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,440
That's right.
On the drive home.

67

- Sir, we didn't...
- Shut up.

Two cars out front.
4 place settings, not 3.

71
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,560
All should have alerted you
to the possibility

72
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,120
that there might be
another suspect.

73
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,120
- I think...
- I'm sorry? What?

74
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,120
What did you say?

75
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,120
I think you enjoy
watching us fail, sir.

76
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,240
Better in here than out there.

77
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,720
You know this really happened?

78
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,880
The UNSUB was apprehended
in under 2 minutes

79
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,640
without a shot fired.

80
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,640
It took you guys 7 minutes,
and you killed your partner.

81
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,240
Have some cake.

82
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,040
The majority of murders
are committed

83
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
by someone known to the victim.

84
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,440
Those that are not solved within
the first 48 hours seldom are.

85
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,000
Not so with serial killers.

86
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,520
One advantage
in this line of work

87
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,560
is knowing that as long as
the UNSUB is out there,

88
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,280
you'll always have
another chance.

89
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,760
With each new killing comes
a resetting of the clock.

90
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,440
Time is on your side.

91
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
The model for this exercise

92
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,120
was a missing-persons search
in Buffalo, 1982.

93
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,480
The dead man was an accomplice
who was killed the day before.

94
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,360
The killer staged a suicide

95
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,120
in order to try, in effect,
an escape.

96
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,680
As you can see, some of you
responded better than others.

97
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,840
Well, exactly how many times
has a profiler

98
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,000
been in a kill-or-capture
situation since 1982?

99
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,000
Are you suggesting I'm
preparing you for something

100
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,040
you may never experience?

101
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,000
Success comes
when you understand

102
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,360
that your most lethal weapon
isn't your firearm,

103
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,560
but your brain.

104
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,760
A lot of the old guard
don't believe in my methods.

105
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,560
A lot of them think I'm crazy.

106
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,120
You're a privileged group.

107
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,400
You're all smart
or you wouldn't be here.

108
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,920
I just want you to be smarter.

109
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,680
Our final exercise will be
on the island of Oneiga.

110
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,720
This simulation will be a test
primarily of your teamwork.

111
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
I hope you're ready.

112
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,920
Then how could we have saved
the girls at the old hotel?

113
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,440
You couldn't. They were dead
no matter what you did.

114
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,120
What's the point
if we couldn't have saved them?

115
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,440
The point is to get used to it.

116
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
? There, you've seen it,
my behavior's unacceptable ?

117
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,240
Good evening, my fine,
young FBI friends.

118
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,520

My parents are loaded
as per my expensive ensemble.

121
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,640
And that "J"...Where is it?
On my key ring...

122
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,280
means I'm either a Jill
or a Jennifer.

123

Those being the favorite "J"
names of Beltway parents

124
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,040
circa 1981.

125
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,600
I like to hang with my friends
and have a good time,

126
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,960
but I'm really just a mature
woman looking for a mature man.

127
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,600
And I recently quit smoking.

128
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,200
[English accent]
Why do you say that?

129
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,600
You see the way she keeps eyeing
the guy next to her?

130
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
It's not him.
It's his cigarette.

131
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,400
Spoken like a woman who knows.

132
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,160
How long has it been, Nicole?
3 days?

133
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,160
The lovely Nicole
and her personal demons.

134
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm surprised there's enough
room at the table for all of us.

135
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,720
Take me 5 minutes
to get her number.

136
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,640
Take me 2.

137
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,160
- You're on.
- Money's coming out.

138
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
$20.

139
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,240
- $20 works.
- Whoo!

140
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,640
Whoa, big money.

141
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,400
Hi. I think I know you,
don't I?

142
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,880
You're, um, uh...

143
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,360
Jill, right?

144
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,400
Jen.

145
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,240
Jen, Jen. Yes.
Yes, Jen, of course.

146
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Okay, obviously
you don't remember me.

147
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,720
My name's Bobby.
Bobby Whitman.

148

Rafe, you're up.
Profile.

149
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,160
Okay.

153
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,800
Preferably blond.

154
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,520
Preferably a cheerleader
with great big...

155
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,920
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Enough.

156
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,760
Right about the blond.
You're on fire.

157
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,520
You're projecting.

158
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,240
I don't know. It was 2 seconds
at a lecture last semester.

159
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,440
GMU Lit Department, right?

160
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,600
The Moody lecture?

161
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,160
Yeah, yeah, Moody.
Heck of a writer.

162
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,400
Um...

163
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,600
I'm actually not even
a student myself.

164
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,120
Um...

165
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,840
I work in finance.

166
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,960
Oh. Finance?

167
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,160
- Oh! Right. Bobby.
- Yeah.

168
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,360
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

169

He's got 15 seconds.

170
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,560
Thank you.

171
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
Lucas, looks like tonight
wasrt your night.

172
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,720
I know her. Her name's Jen.
I told her to play along.

173
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
You're full of shit.

174
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,320
You never know.

175
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
ALL: Ooh.

176
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,520
Ooh.

177
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,760
[Laughter]

178
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,600
So, what is going on
in that head?

179
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,800
We're professionals.

180
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
We shouldn't have to put up
with Harris' shit.

181
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,360
All right, what's up?

182
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm not making profiler.

183
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,120
I was alone in his office.

184
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,960
His recommends were on the desk,
and I read them.

185
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
We still have the weekend
at Oneiga.

186
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,520
He says I'm unfocused.

187
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
He says I'm not capable

188
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,520
of the psychological commitment
necessary for profiling work.

189
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,240
How do you like that?

190
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,440
Commitment. Like,
"Fucking look at me, man."

191
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,440
Vince, I think...

192
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,280
You're not making profiler
either, Sara.

193
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,800
Sorry.
I read it.

194
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
Don't work too hard
out there, okay?

195
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,920
We've got a late addition.

196
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,360
This is Detective Gabe Jenson.

197
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,240
He's from the Philadelphia P.D.

198
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,720
Good morning.
How you doir?

199
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,440
He's their resident profiler,

200
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,200
and somehow he got
on D.O.J.'s good side

201
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,600
and convinced the attorney
general he could sit in

202
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,280
on some exercises
and see how I work.

203
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,400
Do I have the politics
about right?

204
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,640
Something like that.

205
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,960
He's joining the team?

206
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,760
He's just here to observe,
not to participate.

207
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,760
Now, be nice to him
or it's my ass.

208
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,040
No offense, Detective.

209
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,640
None taken. It's an honor
to meet all of you.

210
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,920
You want to do hostage rescue,
a smallpox outbreak,

211
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,400
this is the place.

212
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Navy Seas built it
for war-game practice.

213
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,520
Once a year, they turn it over
to me for the weekend.

214
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,760
Okay, get your rappelling lines
and prepare to drop.

215
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,000
That's a joke.

216
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,760
Here we are.
Crimetown, USA.

217
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,880
Where all the residents
are dead.

218
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,760
Or about to be.

219
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,120
Now, the idea here, people,
is to only kill the bad guys.

220
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,840
[Beeping]

221
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
But nobody's perfect.

222
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,720
It's nice
to hear you say that, sir.

223
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,880
RAFE: It's like Beirut
meets Belfast.

224
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,120
Sir, I thought they didn't let
foreign nationals in the FBI.

225
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Don't worry. On the inside
he's 100% American, right?

226
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,280
As American
as the death penalty.

227
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
HARRIS:
That's my boy.

228
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
I think I'm in love.

229
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,840
Oh, there is one other person.
They'll be coming along shortly.

230
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
Who's that?

231
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,320
He's called a puppeteer.

232
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,560
He's killed two people
on these streets,

233
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,440
and he's about to kill a third.

234
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,120
Tomorrow you'll find
the crime scene

235
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,760
and receive
your background dossiers.

236
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,040
By 0800 on Monday, I want
a full profile of this suspect.

237
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
I want to know who he is,
what he does,

238
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,040
and where he's gonna do it next.

239
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,880
I'm asking Special Agent Reston
to be team leader

240
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,600
unless you'd like to defer.

241
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,440
No, Harris.

242
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,640
I will solve whatever sick,
twisted crime scenario

243
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,760
you come up with.

244
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,960
I hope so.

245
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,720
What's the tank for?

246
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,520
The Navy uses it
to simulate Arctic regions.

247
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,200
That's what the nitrogers for.

248
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,680
In general, if it says
"military," don't touch it.

249
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,760
Oh.
Great.

250
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,520
Navy humor.

251
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,120
The computers are loaded
with ViCAP,

252
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,520
but they're fully firewalled.

253
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,360
Don't do any research offsite.

254
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,440
If you want to do any
blood samples on the autorad,

255
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,520
analyze fibers...
scout samples...

256
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,960
- [Buzzing]
- It's all here.

257
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,160
You'll rest up here
till the morning.

258
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,560
Downstairs, there's
a fully stocked freezer,

259
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,400
bunks, and your showers.

260
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,520
Don't forget.
You're 50 miles offshore.

261
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,200
If you run out of toilet paper,
you are shit out of luck.

262
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,720
So, what's the point?

263
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,800
Sorry, Detective?

264
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,160
The island, the middle of
nowhere, they're professionals.

265
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,200
What's the point?

266
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,080
The point is that they're
isolated, alone, and forgotten.

267
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,840
That's what it's like to be
inside the mind of a sociopath.

268
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,880
Have you noticed it's
a really bad feeling here?

269
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,360
Good luck on your profile.

270
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Go!

What?

280
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,400
He said dress for an island.

281
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,640
J. D:
So, Detective,

282
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,160
what exactly did you do to earn
this island paradise?

283
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Recommended for it.
Same as you.

284
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Why, though?

285
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,600
Did you catch some killer
in Philly or something?

286
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,960
What's the deal?

287
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
You don't want to know
my war stories.

288
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,440
Well, actually, I do.

289
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,240
I mean, right now,

290
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,760
what do we know
about you for real?

291
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,000
We know he's got resentments
toward his parents,

292
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,320
as per the overload on tattoos
he's got there.

293
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,640
We know he's just out
of a bad relationship.

294
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,800
He's barely looked twice
at me and Sara.

295
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,400
Maybe you're not my type,
Nicole.

296
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,120
We're alone on an island.

297
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,560
Trust me, I'm your type.

298
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,560
We also know
he watches his words.

299
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,160
So that crossword's either
a sign of honing a talent

300
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,560
or correcting a deficiency.

301
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,520
What you say about me
doesn't tell you about me.

302
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,880
It tells me about you.

303
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,720
Now, I could say
your little gambling

304
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,120
means you have
an addictive personality.

305
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,240
I could say I know

you're sleeping with one
of the guys in this room.

307
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,160
I could say you take charge
of your team

308
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,040
because you never had a leader
in your own life.

309
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,360
And you.

310
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,360
When push comes to shove,
you crack under pressure.

311
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
Your partners can't depend
on you.

312
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,280
You don't belong here.

313
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,120

I'll have your badge.

I, uh, came out here
to feed the ducks.

323
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,800
I see you're feeding the ducks.

324
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
Maybe we could feed the ducks
together.

325
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,560
Leave you alone?

326
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,120
No, no.
It's all right.

328
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880

It's a gesture.

Goodwill, sympathy.
You know, the usual.

330
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,880
In lieu of knowing
what's going on.

331
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,960
He's not gonna let me
make profiler.

332
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
He thinks I can't get past it.

333
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,280
Is he right?

334
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,080

I lost both my parents.

Bang. Mortality.

337
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,280
So I grew up living real hard.

338
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,080

All I know is this.

343
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,360
You don't confront your demons
and defeat them.

344
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
You confront them.

345
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,960
Then you confront them.

346
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,800
Then you confront them
some more.

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,520
You only want me for my mind.

355
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,440
[Breathing heavily]

356
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,520
[Yowling]

357
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,280
[Grunting]

358
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,240
[Yowling]

359
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,000
[Groans]

360
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,840
[Bell clanging]

361
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,040
[Screams]

362
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,440
NICOLE:
What happened?

363
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,880
I'd like to know
how Harris got it here.

364
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,560
I'd say the issue is "why?"

365
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,880
Here, kitty kitty.

366
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,120
What kind of simulation is this?

367
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,040
Ah. Oh!

368
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,680
Ugh.

369
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,160
10:00.

370
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,280
That supposed to mean something?

371
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,800
So, what, is this supposed to be
some kind of warning sign?

372
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,120
Well, if I know Harris,
it's a sign of something.

373
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,840
It's 9:30 A.M.,
Saturday morning.

374
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,360
We're in search
of an unknown crime scene.

375
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,040
We'll split into pairs.

376
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,560
The first one who finds it wins
my eternal love and devotion.

377
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,120
And a dead cat.

378
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,320
[Cat yowls]

379
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,120
And a dead cat.

380
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,920
[Bell rings]

381
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,240
Now, this place
must remind you of home.

382
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,240
Ha.
Happytown, USA.

383
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,440
Sst!

384
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,520
Look.

385
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,560
It's little Bobby.

386
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,080
Little Bobby's gonna grow up
to be big and strong

387
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,240
and pursue a career
in buried children

388
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,080
and dismembered mummies.

389
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,560
Now, that will make
Happytown proud.

390
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,080
I think you're
in the wrong line of work.

391
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,080
No, mate.

392
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,160
Not me.

393
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,480
Hey!

394
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,880
Dinner at Harris' house.

395
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,440
Pass the nuts.

396
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,960
Charming.

397
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,080
Great.
A cigarette machine.

398
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,320
Temptation is everywhere.

399
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,320
Hey, Agent, we searching
together or what?

400
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,120
Suit yourself.
I'm on vacation.

401
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Hey, Vince!

402
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,120
Check out
the other side of town.

403
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,520
Huh.

405
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,440
Hey, everybody!

406
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,160
Harris, you are one sick
son of a bitch.

407
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,760
Stay on my 6.

408
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,040
Okay, everybody, it's about
that time to look alive.

409
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,800
We have victim.

410
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Or victims?

411
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,280
We got a single victim.
Caucasian female.

412
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,280
25, 26.

413
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,880
The puppeteer.
That's a hell of a signature.

414
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,240
Why don't you check
the employee logs, receipts?

415
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,520
See who shopped here, who
worked here. That sort of thing.

416
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,880
Let me run forensic,
work the timeline.

417
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,960
Sara, why don't you check
the carcass?

418
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,240
Sara!

419
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,240
Sure.

420
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,600
Oh.

421
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,840
There's splatter
behind the counter.

422
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,240
The girl was definitely moved.

423
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,240
Any venture as to weapon?

424
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,520
- You want to take point on M.O.?
- Absolutely.

425
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Nic, not to step on your toes,

426
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,080
but I'm gonna bet
the guy's a trophy taker.

427
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,520
What are you smiling about?

428
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,000
If the taxpayers only knew...

429
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,560
I think I'll go see if the
UNSUB's still in the building.

430
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,160
Sweetheart, it's just
a simulation, yeah?

431
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,960
Where we're from, a site search
is called procedure.

432
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah?

433
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,520
We should have been allowed
to bring our guns.

434
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,360
It doesn't feel real
without my gun.

435
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,960
Hell, Vince,
how real do you want it?

436
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,320
# Welcome to puppet... #

437
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,160
Don't move.
Don't move! Sara.

438
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,480
# Pull my strings,
it's time to play #

439
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,560
Let's see what freak show
Harris has in mind.

440
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,720
# Surprises
at puppet playtime #

441
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,640
It's no fun unless
it's a challenge, right?

442
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,800
# Hope you all enjoy
your stay #

443
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,440
# Welcome to puppet... #

444
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,440
[Music stops]

445
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,280
Move!

446
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,360
Aah.

447
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,040
Aah!

448
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,320
My legs!

449
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,120
No!
Don't touch it!

450
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Help!

451
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,600
It'll burn you!

452
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,400
- They're frozen!
- Help him!

453
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,160
Aah!
Aah!

454
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,960
Aah!
Stop!

455
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,520
[Cracking]

456
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,280
[Breathing heavily]

457
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,920
This is a joke, right?

458
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,520
That was just a simulation.

459
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,080
[Crying]

460
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,200
I'm sorry, Nic.

461
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,960
- Were they working before?
- No signal, nothing.

462
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,000
What if it was
some kind of accident?

463
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,320
Someone killed J.D.
Don't you get it?

464
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Someone is here on this island.

465
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,320
That wasrt there
last night either.

466
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,200
12:00.

467
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,640
It's an hour and a half.

468
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,640
It's a message.

469
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,880
What about the boat?

470
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,400
We saw that pier with the boat
when we flew in.

471
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,440
Watch your backs
and everyone else's.

472
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,000
Hit the boat and find the radio.

473
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,520
The simulatiors over.

474
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,000
Now is not the time for fear,
people.

475
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,040
- Now is the ti...
- [Beeping]

476
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,360
Shit.

477
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,320
- Sara!
- Ohh!

478
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,560
Sara!

479
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,520
Get her out of the water!

480
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,840
[Both gasping]

481
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,400
Help me get her
out of the water!

482
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,400
Get her out of the water!

483
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,240
Ugh!

484
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,400
It's okay.
You're okay.

485
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,960
Aah!

486
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,720
I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.

487
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,840
I've got her.

488
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,360
Back the fuck off!
I'll handle it!

489
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,440
It's okay.

490
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,160
You're out of the water,
all right? You're out.

491
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,520
Aah!

492
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,040
All right.
You're out of the water.

493
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,880
- You're okay.
- What's her thing with water?

494
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,080
I think I lost my smokes.

495
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,520
Harris brought us
to this island.

496
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,560
Now we're not allowed to leave.

497
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,240
- Let's talk about this Harris.
- [Coughing]

498
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,240
Harris wouldn't do this.

499
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,640
You can say what you want,
but Harris is a company man.

500
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,120
Did anyone actually see him
get back in that chopper?

501
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,920
Oh, tell me
somebody witnessed that.

502
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,400
Maybe he got tired
of the simulations.

503
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,960
Missed the taste
of the real thing.

504
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,160
I'll give him a taste
of the real thing.

505
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,480
Did he just pull
that gun out of his arse?

506
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,080
We werert supposed to
bring weapons.

507
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,960
My gun goes where I go.

508
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,840
If you get shot sometime,
maybe you'll understand.

509
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,480
You shouldn't have brought
your weapon, Vince.

510
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,240
You're gonna be glad I did.

511
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,200
Two square miles at most.

512
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,080
Hey.
Check this out.

513
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,760
Who wants to play
some hide-and-seek?

514
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,960
Anyone else is on this island,

515
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,040
Harris or worse,
we're gonna find them.

516
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,080
How's about your Navy?

517
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,280
They don't muck around, do they?

518
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,440
GABE:
Damn cats.

519
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,000
[Thunder crashes]

520
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,960
Aah! Aah!

521
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,000
Oh, for the love of God,
just take the arm.

522
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,040
There. There.
That's the Lucas I know.

523
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,200
You want to get up
and do it all over again.

524
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,240
Are you all right?

525
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,600
Yeah.
I told you I'm fine.

526
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,120
Yeah, you told me, but...

527
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,160
As long as people aren't
asking me if I'm all right,

528
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm all right.

529
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,640
So can I ask you
something else, then?

530
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,560
Anything else.

531
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,960
Well, since the end
may be near here,

532
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,320
have you kind of always
sort of had a thing for me?

533
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,200
Aah!

534
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,480
[Laughs]

535
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,280
Is that a no?

536
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,160
20 minutes of 12:00.

537
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,680
So at 12:00
someone else is killed?

538
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,320
Somebody left those watches.

539
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,120
And left them
after Harris had gone.

540
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,640
Where is this killer?
We searched the island.

541
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,800
Somebody set that trap.

542
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
Somebody rigged that boat.

543
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,720
So what are we saying?

544
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
This is some kind of game?

545
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,840
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

546
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,120
Who's the next motherfucker
to go?

547
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,240
It's 12:00.

548
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,040
It's 12:00,
and we're still here!

549
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,240
We're still here,
and it's 12:00, and...

550
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,240
Shut up, Vince.

551
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,840
All right. Look.

552
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,200
We know that there
is a killer on the island.

553
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,400
Someone who knows
what we're here for,

554
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
someone who knows where we'd be.

555
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,000
There's just one problem.

556
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,320
There's no one
on the island but us.

557
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,920
Now, hold on.

558
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,440
Real slow.

559
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,520
Real easy like.

560
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,160
Let's all move our hands
away from our weapons.

561
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,480
- You get on the ground.
- Lucas.

562
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,040
I'm checking the rooms.
I find this... by his bed.

563
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,280
It's maps of the island,
the building, everything here.

564
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,040
Been doing some research
on the place?

565
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,960
- I can goddamn explain.
- You can get on the ground!

566
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,400
This is a military facility!
No one has access to this stuff!

567
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,200
- [Guns cocking]
- Whoa.

568
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,400
You got me all wrong.

569
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
Oh, yeah, Detective?
They your maps?

570
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,960
I want to see
your hands up. Up!

571
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,080
You believe me.

572
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,520
- No one leaves this room.
- Since when is this room safe?

573
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,920
Since we're all in it.

574
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,880
On your knees now.

575
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,080
Now! Down!

576
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,880
Sara, can you feel your face?

577
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,760
Because I can't feel
your face...

578
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,960
Coffee.

579
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,560
Huh?

580
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,560
There's something in the coffee.

581
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,160
- Ohh!
- [Cup shatters]

582
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,960
Ohh.

583
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,840
[Cup shatters]

584
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,080
Ohh!

585
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,280
SARA:
Hey, Nic...

586
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,040
Stay... away from...

587
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,680
[Speaking indistinctly]

588
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,240
[Cup shatters]

589
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,560
[Beeps]

590
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,720
[Meows]

591
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,080
- [Grunts]
- You going somewhere?

592
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,240
Come here.

593
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,120
Sit down.

594
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,360
- Hey, man, I can explain.
- Shut up.

595
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
- Listen, I can explain.
- I said shut up!

596
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,000
You don't know
what you're doing.

597
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,160
You don't know who I am.

598
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,760
I know you killed J.D.
That's what I know.

599
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,360
Is everybody all right?

600
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,800
Sara.

601
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,040
Sara.

602
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,360
Hey. Hey.
Sara.

603
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,600
Sara? Hey.

604
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,520
[Breathing heavily]

605
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,280
I just had the worst dream ever.

606
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,000
Come on.

607
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,720
Look.

608
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,920
If I'm the killer,
why didn't I run?

609
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,080
You were all lying here.
How come so am I?

610
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,240
Maybe it's a trick so you
can finish what you started!

611
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,360
Look, I'll tell you why
the maps were in the bedroom.

612
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,560
No! You tell us
what you put in the coffee!

613
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,760
- That's what you tell us.
- Hey! Who made it?

614
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Did I make the coffee?

615
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,560
Sherlock Holmes
over there made it.

616
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,400
The man is calling you a killer.

617
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,120
Personally, I think you might
want to defend yourself.

618
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,920
Aah! Aah! Aah!

619
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,920
Oh, fuck!
Ohh!

620
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,120
[Whimpers]
Oh, fuck!

621
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,400
There's...

622
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,840
There's no blood.

623
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,600
Somebody...

624
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,880
drained his blood.

625
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,760
LUCAS:
6:00.

626
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Two watches.

627
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,360
Two watches means two victims?

628
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,360
We got 20 minutes.

629
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,320
All right.

630
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,680
[Grunting]

631
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,280
Right. I want to know what
the next trap is.

632
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,240
And I want to know now.

633
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,680
I can't tell you
because I don't know!

634
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,680
You've been lying to us
since we got here.

635
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,400
That doesn't make me
the killer.

636
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,960
The dead people does.

637
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,320
How about the Ioner mentality?

638
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,240
How about the issues
with the FBI?

639
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,360
I'm not a cop.

640
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,560
I'm an investigator
with the Department of Justice.

641
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,200
I was sent to
investigate Harris.

642
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,760
The attorney general was hearing
rumors about his methods.

643
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,320
There was talk he was
pushing trainees too far.

644
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,760
The FBI investigates the FBI.

645
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,560
Not if you want it done right.

646
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,760
Look, they took him out
of the field for a reason.

647
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,680
Justice was talking
maybe that wasrt enough.

648
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,360
They sent me to see
how he works you.

649
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,720
The maps were prep.
It's a job!

650
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,320
Oh, this is not happening.

651
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,640
You want to hook me up to
a polygraph, hook me up!

652
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,640
Yeah, we know how to beat
a polygraph, too.

653
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,440
He's lying.
Watch his eyes.

654
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,480
I'm not lying.
I just don't like you.

655
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,000
Okay.
You got 15 minutes.

656
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,520
So tell us where the trap is,

657
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,200
or you never leave this room,
and I mean never.

658
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,560
Don't take your eyes off of him.

659
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,320
Okay.

660
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,800
[Door closes]

661
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,800
Now, start talking.

662
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,880
It's a nine-number sequence
repeating itself.

663
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,520
Nine permutations.

664
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,080
What? A code?
A combination?

665
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,320
It has something to do
with time!

666
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,040
He has an obsession with time!

667
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,880
Forget the numbers.
We need to find the trap.

668
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,440
The numbers are the message.

669
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,600
What if it tells us
where the trap might be?

670
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,360
Fine. Bobby,
help her work the numbers.

671
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,120
I'm searching the building.

672
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,840
I'm searching with you.

673
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,160
[Sighs]

674
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,680
10 minutes.

675
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,560
Phone number, Social Security
number, coordinates.

676
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,680
- Talk to me!
- Seven minutes.

677
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,840
Between you and me...

678
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
I'm not a violent person.

679
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,600
The thing I've learned
in my life is this.

680
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,440
Sometimes if you find yourself
feeling deep anger

681
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,800
and frustration

682
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,600
about where you find yourself,
what has happened to you...

683
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,400
The healthy thing to do
is to find an outlet

684
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,760
and let it all fucking go.

685
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,040
6:00.

686
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,160
One of us dies,
my outlet is you.

687
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,880
[Beeps]

688
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,840
I am not your guy.

689
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You don't want to do this, man.

690
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,480
You'll have to live
with what you don't know.

691
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,600
I think we're clear
on this level.

692
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
The obsession is time.
It has to do with time.

693
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,160
I know it.

694
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,120
5, 8, 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4.
What is it?

695
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Sara, it's no use.

696
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,600
8, 2, 9, 9, 7, 9, 2, 4, 5.

697
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
- What is that?
- Sara...

698
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,160
2, 9, 9, 7, 9...

699
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,480
It's a number!
It's a fucking number!

700
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,160
They're all just
fucking numbers!

701
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,520
7, 9, 2... 4, 5, 8... 2, 7, 9.

702
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,800
Anybody? Anyone?
What are we thinking here?

703
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,440
What about a rate?

704
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,800
When you factor in time,
an amount becomes a rate.

705
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,800
Or a speed!

706
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,920
Yes. What kind of speed
do you measure in the millions?

707
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,560
Atoms? Electrons?
How the hell should I know?

708
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,720

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,320
This is the original
measurement for light!

712
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,640
And you know that?

713
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,720
It's the basic principle
of physics.

Along with "Shit happens."

Near the Outer Banks
of North Carolina?

It's one of the first sites

in the New World.

847
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,800
In the 16th century,
there was a ship of settlers

who landed right around here,

849

that the colony had vanished

we still don't know
where those people have gone.

if I didn't.

All right, we know method,
we know motive.

01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,440
Remotes.

1246
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,480
But at the end of the day,

1247
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:09,680
building a better mousetrap
is just pure mechanics.

1248
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:13,240
It's knowing how to bait
a particular mouse.

1249
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,280
That's the fun part.

1250
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,640
[Gasps]

1251
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:18,240
Ah, ah, ah-ah.

1252
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,800
So there I was.

1253
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,880
Sitting next to the bodies
of my parents.

1254
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,000
Just waiting for someone

1255
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,520
to ask me
why I killed them, you know?

1256
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,320
And this detective
comes up to me, right?

1257
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,120
And he says...

1258
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,920
"Want some gum?"

1259
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,360
Gum.

1260
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,080
No one asks.

1261
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,640
It never even occurs to them.

1262
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,160
And like after
every first high...

1263
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,720
it's harder and harder
to get to that place.

1264
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,360
And finally you get so good,
there's no feeling at all.

1265
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,840
It's easy.

1266
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,680
Finding a won'thy prey.

1267
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,960
A challenge.

1268
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,520
That's hard.

1269
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,760
You joined the FBI for this?

1270
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,120
Yeah.

1271
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,320
Yeah.

1272
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,960
So while you were studying
tired old hacks

1273
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,680
like Bundy, Gacy, and Dahmer,

1274
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,600
I was studying you.

1275
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:29,280
Your habits, your hang-ups,
your weaknesses.

1276
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,040
It was so simple
to set you all on edge.

1277
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:35,560
You know?

1278
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,560
I had to push here...

1279
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,200
pull there...
but once I did...

1280
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,640
LUCAS: Hey, Vince, check out
the other side of town.

1281
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,960
I knew each of you
would play your part.

1282
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,240
The key to effective illusion
is misdirection.

1283
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,560
You know there's a bomb
on the boat.

1284
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,720
You don't run toward it
first in line.

1285
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,160
You know?

1286
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,920
All I needed was opportunity.

1287
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,280
The coffee break gave me
the chance I needed

1288
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,120
to rig a few little surprises.

1289
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,280
The answer was
in front of your eyes.

1290
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,720
You still couldn't see it.

1291
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,240
It was you who said
to turn off the water.

1292
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,440
The rest was easy.

1293
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,560
You're all
so fucking predictable.

1294
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,040
Nicole with her cigarettes.

1295
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:19,360
Can't she even read
the warning label on the box?

1296
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,600
Vince...
"I'm never without my gun."

1297
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,920
Bobby the Magnificent
couldn't resist.

1298
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:30,400
And Harris
just had to stay and watch.

1299
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,360
Party crasher here was more
of a problem than I thought,

1300
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,920
but why am I gonna work
so hard to kill him

1301
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,920
when I knew you'd do it for me?

1302
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:46,040
You see, the water
ain't your only weakness, Sara.

1303
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,080
[Shuddering]

1304
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,480
Your other weakness...

1305
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,040
is me.

1306
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,160
In truth, I couldn't have
done it without you.

1307
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:26,160
As a sign of my appreciation,
I'm gonna grant you

1308
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,480
your deepest desire.

1309
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:32,040
I'm gonna get you closer to your
sister than you ever imagined.

1310
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,840
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi.

1311
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,160
- Are we having fun yet?
- [Gasping]

1312
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,040
Whoa.

1313
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,680
[Chuckling]

1314
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,680
[Gasps]

1315
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,800
[Gasps]

1316
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,640
Drop it!

1317
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,840
Go ahead, Sara.
Arrest me.

1318
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,000
We have your blood
under Rafe's fingernails.

1319
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,400
Your fingerprints
on the fire extinguisher.

1320
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,000
And your bullet in my neck.

1321
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:27,200
That don't look good.

1322
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,520
You're fucked.

1323
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,360
[Ticking]

1324
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,440
- [Gasps]
- Time's up, asshole.

1325
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,480
Good thing you hit like a girl.

1326
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,520
I guess we found out
his weakness.

1327
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,320
Bullets.

1328
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,320
[Helicopter blades whirring]

1329
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,960
Do you think they'll let me
make profiler?

1330
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:52,440
That depends.
One last question.

1331
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:57,320
Whers the situation secure,
Agent?

1332
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,760
On the drive home.

1333
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,080
Yeah.

1334
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,520
On the drive home.

1335
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,840
