1
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,238
Good morning.

2
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,157
Hiroshi, look.
He still carries his scetchbook.

3
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,479
He seems so normal
since he has lost his wife.

4
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,519
It's a month ago
now that his wife left him.

5
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,639
I wonder where he's going with the torch.

6
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,558
Wait, Hiroshi!

7
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,877
This is my secret place.

8
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,311
All my lost treasures are here.

9
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,273
All the beautiful things I have ever lost,
they are here.

10
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,830
All the time I have lost
is here.

11
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,514
Everything is hidden in the darkness.

12
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,357
When I was a child, there used to be
a river here. I played there.

13
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,395
Fish, friends, dragonflies...

14
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,637
They disappeared.

15
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,318
Chibi, is that you?

16
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,238
You were away all of a sudden!

17
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,711
And now you are here
in this cold place.

18
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,318
You poor thing.

19
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,833
I am a painter.

20
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,878
I have to paint Chibi.

21
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,436
You?

22
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,795
I met you once.
Then, when there was a river here.

23
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,958
It was you then?

24
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,038
Yes, I am the mermaid.

25
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,789
When the river got dried
this is where I stranded.

26
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,472
I can hear you. Your voice
sounds in my heart.

27
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,155
You have been living here in the dark...

28
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,078
all this time.

29
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,753
Ever since the day I met you here
I enjoy coming here.

30
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,191
I came here for years in order to paint.

31
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,713
Now I understand the reason.

32
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,756
Why?

33
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,151
Just to see you again
and to paint.

34
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,958
Everything, I have ever lost,
I can find in you.

35
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,992
From now on I will paint you all the time.

36
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,798
What is it?

37
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,592
You get something in such places.

38
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,037
We go home. To my place.

39
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,353
We have to look after the infection.

40
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,557
Let's go home.

41
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,116
Thanks.

42
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,150
Let me see.

43
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,198
This will certainly help you.

44
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,909
This medicine heals all kinds
of diseases.

45
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,118
You better paint me.
That is your mission.

46
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,438
Yes, my mission.

47
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,838
That's true.

48
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,558
I am a painter.

49
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,598
I will paint you.

50
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,909
From now on I will paint you forever.

51
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,038
Hiroshi, what happened to the painter
from upstairs?

52
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,839
He used to go out everyday
with his scetchbook.

53
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,833
How should I know about it?
-Haven't I told you

54
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,469
that they delivered a
bathtub last week?

55
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,393
Why are you so interested in this guy?

56
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,998
Stop it.

57
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,958
Then stop it.

58
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,198
You are so stupid!

59
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,198
What is it?

60
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,478
Are you ok?

61
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,194
Wait.

62
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,198
Wait.

63
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,878
Thank goodness.

64
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,238
It stopped.

65
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,278
Thank goodness.

66
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,396
Thanks.

67
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,112
This medicine doesn't seem to work.

68
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,199
Damn it.

69
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,278
You should eat something.

70
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,398
What do you want?

71
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,352
It's long ago that I had fish.

72
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,156
Fish.

73
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,116
I'll get you some fresh fish.

74
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,199
Wait here.

75
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,916
Hello.

76
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,309
Is it true?
-Yes, it's true. I was shocked.

77
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,152
I see half bitten raw fish
in the trash every day.

78
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,471
You can judge people according to
their trash.

79
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,790
It is very strange.
I'm sick of it.

80
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,838
Yes, it is strange.
A whole fish in one bite.

81
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,799
Maybe he bought a little pet monster.

82
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,394
Hiroshi, you frighten me!

83
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,513
Are you sure you want it?

84
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,273
Yes, there are little pupps of seven
different colours in these tumours.

85
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,309
My body is full of little pupps
of seven colours.

86
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,715
I suffer so much.
Please hurry.

87
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,191
My body hurts!

88
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,274
I suffer.

89
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,438
Hurry up!

90
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,270
Do it.

91
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,752
I am tired.

92
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,798
I need a break.

93
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,278
I go out to get some fish.

94
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,796
What?

95
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,758
Are you ok?

96
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,992
Don't die.

97
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,038
Don't die!

98
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,200
She died.

99
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,157
My mermaid is dead.

100
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,274
She died.

101
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,278
My precious mermaid died.

102
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,598
She died.

103
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,998
She died.

104
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,196
Quick, you have to paint me.

105
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,275
You have to paint me in the
moment before I die. Hurry up!

106
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,996
The painting.

107
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,238
It's finished.

108
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,993
Now I have to look after you.

109
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,758
No, it's too late.

110
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,037
You have to kill me now.

111
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,748
It's a long time ago that
I've seen the painter from upstairs.

112
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:50,233
I wonder what has happened.
-I smell rotten fish.

113
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,269
It's so strange.
It makes me sick.

114
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,198
Do you think something is wrong?

115
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,113
What?

116
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,518
What's that?

117
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,268
Hiroshi...

118
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,278
Mr Haydashi?

119
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,878
It's open.

120
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,398
She's dead.

121
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,597
My mermaid is dead.

122
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,238
She is dead.

123
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,517
My mermaid is dead.

124
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,158
She is dead.

125
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,236
So...

126
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,078
What can I say?

127
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,391
The dead body must belong
to his wife.

128
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,238
It's a terrible story.
She was awfully injured.

129
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,278
You know, there was a baby in there.

130
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,158
When I think about it...

131
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,113
Are you ok?

132
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,438
I'm scared!

133
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,557
He killed his wife.

134
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,318
Let us pass.

135
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,270
His wife had been bedridden
for a long time.

136
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,640
He was an art teacher.

137
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,473
A very gentle, friendly man.

138
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,318
What will happen to him?

139
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,758
I have no idea.

140
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,268
Beautiful...

141
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,119
Beautiful...

142
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,959
This is the result of the investigation.
According to the autopsy report

143
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,989
the painter dismembered his wife.
She was pregnant, in her eight month

144
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,312
and was in the last state
of stomach cancer.

145
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,629
The foetus died in the mother.

146
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,835
The painter insisted on having killed
a mermaid.

147
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,713
According to the psychological test
he is schizophrenic

148
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,749
and got hospitalized.
This is the result of the investigation.

149
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,149
A scale was found in his
bathtub.

150
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,597
The Japanese Fishery Laboratory
couldn't find out

151
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,270
what kind of fish
it is from.
