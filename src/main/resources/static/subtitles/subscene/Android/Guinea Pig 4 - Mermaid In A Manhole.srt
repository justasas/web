00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,238 
Hello.  

2 
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,157 
Hiroshi, look at.  It always has his notebook.  

3 
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,479 
It is strange since that his woman left it.  

4 
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,519 
Ca does now a month that she left.  

5 
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,639 
I wonder where it goes with his wipes.  

6 
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,558 
Awaits, Hiroshi!  

7 
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,877 
THIS IS my secret hiding place.  

8 
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,311 
All my lost treasures are here. 

9
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,273
All the beautiful things that I lost are here.  
10
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,830
the whole times that I lost is here.  
11
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,514
All is hidden in the darkness.  
12
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,357
When I was again child, there was a river.  I came to play here.  
13
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,395
Fish, friends, dragonflies...  
14
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,637
They all disappeared.  
15
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,318
Chibi, this is you?  
16
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,238
You disappeared so suddenly!  
17
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,711
And I rediscover here in this dark place.  
18
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,318
small Poor thing.  
19
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,833
I am a painter.  
20
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,878
I must paint you Chibi.  
21
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,436
You?  
22
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,795
I already met you.  Before, when there was a river here.  
23
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,958
IT WAS well you?  
24
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,038
Yes, I am a siren.  
25
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,789
When the river drained itself, I failed here.  
26
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,472
I hear you.  Your voice resounds in my heart.  
27
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,155
You lived here in the darkness...  
28
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,078
for this whole times...  
29
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,753
Since that I met you, I love this place.  
30
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,191
I come here since years to paint.  
31
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,713
Now I understand why.  
32
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,756
Why?  
33
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,151
Just to review you and paint.  
34
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,958
all that I lost, I rediscover it in you.  
35
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,992

36
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,798
That Is this that this is?  
37
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,592
You had to catch a strange thing.  
38
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,037
let us Go at my place.  
39
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,353
One will take care of this infection.  
40
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,557
let us Return.  
41
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,116
Thank-you.  
42
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,150
Leaves me to see.  
43
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,198
Ca should help you.  
44
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,909
This medicine can heal all the evil.  
45
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,118
You would do better to paint me.  This is your mission.  
46
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,438
Yes, my mission.  
47
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,838
completely.  
48
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,558
I am a painter.  
49
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,598

50
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,909

51
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,038
Hiroshi, does what arrive to the painter that lives up there?  
52
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,839
It goes out everyday with his sketch notebook.  
53
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,833
How wants you that I know it?  - I related you that it was himself
54
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,469
done book a bathtub last week?  
55
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,393
Why, it interests you so as that?  
56
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,998
Stops that.  
57
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,958
Then stops, you!  
58
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,198
You are really stupid!  
59
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,198
That Is this that this is?  
60
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,478
You go well?  
61
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,194

62
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,198
Go.  
63
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,878
Thank-you my God.  
64
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,238
Ca stopped itself.  
65
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,278
Thank-you my God.  
66
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,396
Thank-you.  
67
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,112
This medicine has not the air to walk. 
125
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,236
Good...  
126
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,078
well by where to begin...  
127
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,391
The corpse must be the one of his woman.  
128
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,238
THIS IS a terrible matter.  She brutally was mutilated.  
129
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,278
know You, she was pregnant.  
130
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,158
Nothing that of there to think...  
131
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,113
How that goes?  
132
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,438
I am frightened!  
133
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,557
It killed his woman.  
134
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,318
Leave to pass us.  
135
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,270
His woman was nailed to the bed since a times end.  
136
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,640
IT WAS a drawing professor.  
137
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,473
A very kind man.  
138
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,318
That goes it t to arrive for him?  
139
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,758
No idea.  
140
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,268
Magnificent...  
141
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,119
Magnificent...  
142
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,959
Here the results of the investigation.  According to the autopsy report,
143
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,989
it would have dismembered his woman.  She was pregnant of 8 months
144
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,312
and was in final phase of a cancer of the stomach.  
145
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,629
The fetus is dead inside the mother.  
146
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,835
The painter asserts to have killed a siren.  
147
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,713
The psychological tests concluded that it was schizophrène
148
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,749
and it was committed little time after.  Here the results of the search.  
149
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,149
scales were rediscovered in his bathtub.  
150
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,597
But the origin of this fish remains
151
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,270
to this indeterminate day.
