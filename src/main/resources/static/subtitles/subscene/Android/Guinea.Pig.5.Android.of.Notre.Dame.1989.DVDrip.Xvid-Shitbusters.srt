1
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,433
I'm in a dream, of which
I can't escape.

2
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,638
Time flies. Eternal silence.

3
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,231
The eternal light flickers in my heart.

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,434
The body became meaningless.

5
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,118
The world is far away.

6
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,079
Silence becomes darkness
that covers everything.

7
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,712
The only thing that is important
is happiness.

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,916
The happiness of being together.

9
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,192
The problem is grouping the DNA.

10
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,074
Could you please die once more?

11
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,196
Mr Karawaza?

12
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,875
You are looking for something, don't you?

13
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,275
I don't have a lot of time
that's why I'll cut it short.

14
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,158
Who are you?
-Excuse me,

15
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,199
I didn't introduce myself.
Let's say my name is Kato.

16
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,309
Why did you dial this number?
-I know exactly what you are looking for.

17
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,991
I know everything you ordered last year...

18
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,116
such as clothes, food, household goods,
medicine

19
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,997
and animals for laboratory purposes.

20
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,476
And of course the re-numbering
of the Haidon company

21
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,190
for the development
of the super-computer software.

22
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,796
I know everything. I see everything.

23
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,511
It is about the time, isn't it?

24
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,030
It is about the time to give medicine
to your sister.

25
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,114
How do you know about my sister?
-I'll come back to it later.

26
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,398
I will give you what you need
and you pay compensation.

27
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,438
That's how the business works.

28
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,556
Business?

29
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,110
A 21 year old woman.
Price: 10 million yen.

30
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,157
You received that amount
from the Haidon company.

31
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,198
It's a deal.

32
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,872
You can pay after you received the goods.
I'll explain later.

33
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,556
Please transfer the money
to three different accounts.

34
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,398
You'll receive the Guinea Pig
tomorrow afternoon.

35
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,190
Sister, it's time for you medicine!

36
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,398
Thanks.

37
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,438
How are you?

38
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,997
As usual. Always the same.
It's getting worse.

39
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,031
Don't say that.
Don't give up hope.

40
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,835
Yes, but...

41
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,590
Surely I know my body best.

42
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,078
That's true.

43
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,598
Are you ok?

44
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,996
Sorry. It's better now.

45
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,354
My sister's heart is
becoming weaker.

46
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,194
It's being attacked by her own
white blood cells.

47
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,229
I have to find the missing link
in the wonder of birth of mankind.

48
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,035
She's dead for five days already.

49
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,398
You work hard.

50
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,190
What's that?

51
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,438
I found an oil source.

52
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,198
Can you keep that for me?

53
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,150
Whatever happens, don't
loose it.

54
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,194
Ok.

55
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,673
Sister, time for your medicine.

56
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,158
Thanks.

57
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,631
I put it here. I count on you
that you drink it.

58
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,955
That's no good. It's too old.

59
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,991
What's going on here so late at night?

60
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,270
Sister, her wrist is torn off.

61
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,638
Give me yours.

62
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,433
It's for your best.

63
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,277
Sister, did you know that the
Hunchback of Notre Dame

64
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,196
was an android?

65
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,438
No, I didn't.

66
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,756
Sister...

67
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,950
My research is soon finished.
Then your disease maybe...

68
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,918
That would make me happy.

69
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,998
Who's there?

70
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,038
It's me, Kate.

71
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,473
I have transferred the money already.

72
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,429
I have to have a serious talk
to you.

73
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,233
You'll surely let me in if I
say: "missing link".

74
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,633
How did you get this?

75
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,669
Our computer is linked with the department
of molecular biology in Boston.

76
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,397
My partner has the rest.

77
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,151
I would like to give this information
to you.

78
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,074
I think it's not a bad deal.
-I don't want to.

79
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,438
Why? Your medical research...
-I don't want to.

80
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,679
I don't want to be used
for money making.

81
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,630
First you kill,
then you save a life.

82
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,994
You kill a woman
and save your sister's life.

83
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,038
Please go!

84
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,511
Look at these data!

85
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,878
A virus has already invaded
your computer system.

86
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,876
Don't worry. I and my partner know
the password.

87
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,512
Now you have to show me your laboratory.

88
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,513
Finally you woke up, Mr Kato.
It hasn't been easy.

89
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,990
But I got hold of important
data.

90
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,316
I kept your emotions and your memory
before you were brain-dead.

91
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,235
But I had great difficulty
in wiring your nervous system.

92
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,798
Is it too close?

93
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,830
I wonder if you live or not.

94
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,996
You died three days ago.
Then I revived you.

95
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,194
But only your head.
I found it.

96
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,558
Yes, that's true.

97
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,117
He isn't here, honestly.

98
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,878
That was your partner.

99
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,198
I want to know the rest.

100
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,315
I want her address.

101
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,915
You can talk, can't you?

102
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,516
Soon.

103
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,156
Soon.

104
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,438
It'll happen soon.

105
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,436
That's good.

106
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,916
Is that your partner?
-Keiko.

107
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,878
Ah, her name is Keiko.

108
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,638
You won't manage to do that.

109
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,909
Mr Kato, I will implant a new
memory.

110
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,558
I understand. Yes. Yes.

111
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,469
Mr Kato,
I will now enter new data.

112
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,758
Please, come here.

113
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,718
It won't take long until you
live again.

114
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,796
Sister.

115
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,516
Sister.

116
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,471
Why did you bring me back to life?

117
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,197
Finally I found peace.

118
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,795
The world is far away.

119
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,759
Silence becomes darkness,
that covers all.

120
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,150
So many decades have been gone
since then.

121
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,710
I created God,
the devil and myself.

122
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,875
And I'm still there. Alive.

123
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,116
My body still hears
the bells for my sister.
