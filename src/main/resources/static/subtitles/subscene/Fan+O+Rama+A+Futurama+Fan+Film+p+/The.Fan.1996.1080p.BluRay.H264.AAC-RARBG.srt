1
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,400
Excited and anxious
I await my dream

2
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,300
To escape, applaud
And embrace my team

3
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,200
Opening day I always can trust

4
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,100
It's just for this high
That I crazily lust

5
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Return of our hero
Does brighten the days

6
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,100
Just briefly, my troubles
Get lost in the haze

7
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,600
The grace from the field
Arouses the crowd

8
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,100
Reflects on the days
When I was quite proud

9
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm more entranced
Than the average fan

10
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,300
I used to play, you see
And I know I still can

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,500
That time I drove the ball
With such loft

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,300
My exit atop shoulders
As they carried me off

13
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,100
This pastime and I
Just fade into one

14
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,100
Expanded upon
From father and son

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,900
My boy is young
And awkward for now

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
I just need the time
And can show him how

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,900
I really am quite close
Just a break away

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,700
From straightening things out
And being okay

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,100
I can help my team
To regain its glory

20
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,600
With just a little twist
To the same old story

21
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,600
Players say now
They play for themselves

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,900
This causes a burning
Within me that dwells

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
The fan is the one
Who pays for the game

24
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,700
Which bestows all the riches
And welcomed fame

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,300
The players will listen
But really don't hear

26
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,500
All the while just hiding
Behind an invisible tear

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,100
I grow tired now of all this greed

28
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,000
And chart a course to set things free

29
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,300
We got our first caller.
Is that Gil on the cellular?

30
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,500
Yes, sir, it sure is.

31
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,600
- What's that I hear in the background?
- That's my Giants watch.

32
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,400
- I'm late for work.
- Giants watch, great.

33
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,000
- What do you got for us, Gil?
- It's just I'm really psyched.

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,700
Opening day's tomorrow.
We're all psyched.

35
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,200
This is different. I've been waiting
a long time for this one.

36
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,200
- What are you waiting for?
- Bobby Rayburn. We got him.

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,200
- We're going all the way this year.
- What would you bet on that?

38
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,900
- I'd bet everything I own, that's for sure.
- I like this guy. You think Rayburn's...

39
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
...worth the 40 mil, huh?
-.310 lifetime batting average.

40
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,900
He's worth twice that,
three times that.

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,500
I bet he'd love to hear you say that.
Let's see if we can get him on the line.

42
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,200
- You're gonna get him on the line?
- "Yes. Hang on. Let's find Bobby."

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600
When we come back, we will be
talking to Bobby Rayburn.

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
Great.

45
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,300
You got Bobby Rayburn
on the line yet?

46
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,900
Who the fuck does this
guy think he is?

47
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,700
- Three- time National League MVP?
- That allows him to fuck up my show?

48
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,500
- "Hello, I got Rayburn on the line."
- We got him!

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
And go.

50
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,400
Welcome back, we're here with the
hopes and dreams of all Giants fans.

51
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,700
Ex-Brave centre fielder
and league RBI champ...

52
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,900
... four of the last five years,
Local boy come home, Bobby Rayburn.

53
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,100
- How you doing, Bobby?
- Hey, Jewel, how you doing?

54
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,700
Good to be talking to you.
I want to tell you, I love your show.

55
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,500
- Thanks a lot.
- Bobby, this is Bernie...

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,500
A lot of fans are on the line
dying to talk to you.

57
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
But first, how does it feel
to be back in the Bay Area?

58
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm telling you, it's great. I grew up
here. The Giants are my homies.

59
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,100
That's good to hear.
But let me ask you this:

60
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,200
You're famous for your
dedication to perfection.

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,900
You're one of the
hardest-working players.

62
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
Don't forget "good-looking."

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
But come on, now. Bobby, baby...

64
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,200
...do you honestly think you are worth
40 million simoleons?

65
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,000
He's one of the best ballplayers
in the league.

66
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,300
I'm glad you asked me. I don't like to
put a money value on a human being.

67
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,600
But I think I have given 100 percent
to every franchise I've played with.

68
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,600
Attaway, Bobby!

69
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,400
Thank you for not answering.

70
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,500
- Better retreat.
- She's a riot.

71
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,900
What about the fans? Won't all
this money raise their expectations?

72
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,100
I hope so. I consider myself a
baseball fan first and a player second.

73
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,400
And in the game of baseball,
it's all about the fans.

74
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,200
- You tell them, Bob.
- And the Juan Primo controversy?

75
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,400
Giants centre fielder since 1990.

76
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,700
You come in, bump him to the left.
Some people resent that.

77
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,600
- Bitch!
- I don't think Primo's one of them.

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
You know, he's a team player.

79
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
That makes him great.
I look forward to playing with him.

80
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,200
That's great, Bobby.
Let's get back to our callers. Gil?

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,800
- Yeah, am...? Am I on the air?
- Yes, you are, Gil.

82
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,200
Jewel, why do you
have to be so negative?

83
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Come on, I'm a sweetheart.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,800
The guy's making a lot of money.
Would you turn it down?

85
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,700
You'd be nuts to turn them down.

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,200
Why be down on Rayburn
because he's not nuts?

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,000
You got a point. I apologize.

88
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,900
- "Hey, Bobby, are you listening to me?"
- I sure am!

89
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,400
- Thanks for backing me up, man.
- No problem. It's a pleasure.

90
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,700
Just remember
where you heard it first.

91
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,700
I played the game.
I know what I'm talking about.

92
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,600
Grew up on the Giants.

93
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,500
My dad moved the family here
when the Giants moved here.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,600
I watched you ever since
you hit the grand slam...

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,500
...against South Bay
in the '82 city championship.

96
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,500
That's when I saw you were somebody
special, and you never let me down.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,900
When the two of you come together,
Rayburn and the Giants...

98
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,900
...that's like a magical conjunction,
like the alignment of the planets.

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,200
You're gonna bring us all the way.
Who said it first?

100
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,800
You did, Gil! You did!

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,800
- Attaway, Bobby!
- We hope so.

102
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,900
- Bobby, let's talk about your divorce.
- Christ, look.

103
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,000
I just got to the ballpark.
I'm really sorry, but I gotta go.

104
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,100
- Really enjoyed talking to you.
- Anytime, Bobby. Good luckout there.

105
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,900
We will be right back.

106
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,600
- I am so surprised he hung up.
- Thank you.

107
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,600
Giants haven't had a one- two punch
like this since Mays and McCovey.

108
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
Joining the list of bullshit excuses...

109
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,100
...we've had a lot of whining...

110
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,900
...about product quality from certain
members of our sales force.

111
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,200
Example: The two Jima line.

112
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,700
Gil, do you see
any quality problems there?

113
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,400
Blade's too thin, pommel's too light,
and there's a half tang hidden in there.

114
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,200
Maybe that's why you're not selling.

115
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,100
Sweet.

116
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,300
Somebody made a mistake, man.
I wear number 11.

117
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,500
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- It's cool. Manny, just handle it.

118
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Me? I think this knife's an asskicker.

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,500
This door, on the other hand,
comes off a foreign car.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,600
Well, need I say more?

121
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,500
- Why are you guys still here?
- There's been a glitch, okay?

122
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,700
- I'm working on it.
- What's a "glitch"?

123
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,400
A detail that hasn't been worked out.
Permutation that happens in...

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
What? With my number?

125
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,100
- Yeah, with your number.
- No, no, no.

126
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,200
Manny, you know I wear number 11.

127
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
- Of course.
- So there shouldn't be any problem.

128
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
It is a problem. Primo wears 11.

129
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Tickets in yet?

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,300
Tickets? What tickets?

131
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,400
- Opening day.
- You got other things to worry about.

132
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,400
I'll let you in on a little secret, Gil. You
came this close to kissing pavement.

133
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,700
- How about that close?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,200
Management had you on the list.
I talked them out of it.

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,300
Don't make me regret it.

136
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,500
- Thanks, master.
- Okay, fuck it.

137
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm not playing with number 33.
You understand?

138
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
I know. Just be cool.
Let me take care of it.

139
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,100
Three times 11 is 33.
You may play three- times better.

140
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
Thanks. I'll talk to you in a minute.

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,400
Jesus was 33 when he died.
People still talk about him.

142
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,100
- Give me my number.
- Think about it, seriously.

143
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,100
Should I fire him?

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,600
I should fire him, huh?
I should fire his butt.

145
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,500
Good form.

146
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,200
Seriously. I promised those tickets
to my clients.

147
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,700
Don't make me look
like an asshole. Please.

148
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,700
- I do have a reputation to uphold.
- A reputa...

149
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,600
Jesus-fucking"..."

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,200
Nobody cares. You're stuck in a
time warp with your head up your ass.

151
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,400
- Why, because I don't wanna sell crap?
- We are not dedicated to perfection!

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,600
People don't want quality.
They want cheap product.

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
When that fucks up, they want to
replace it, so that's what we give them.

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,600
You got till the end of the month, Gil.

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,700
Look...

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,700
...McKinley and Everest is our
biggest account. You better close on it.

157
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Bring in the fucking numbers.

158
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Asshole.

159
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Sid, what was the missing link
on your ball club last season?

160
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,700
We'd have made the playoffs if Rayburn
hadn't hit that three- run shot in Atlanta.

161
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,700
Everybody said, "Why don't we
have a slugger like that?" Now we do.

162
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
- Bobby, a picture?
- Why don't we take one with Primo.

163
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,000
- Sounds good.
- Keep smiling.

164
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
Keep fucking smiling.

165
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,300
- I hope you like it in centre field.
- Yeah, I hope you like it in left.

166
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
No more questions.

167
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,900
2.5 million signing bonus.
Half this year and half the next. Yeah.

168
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,300
Well, well, if it isn't Jewel, my favourite
token female sports reporter.

169
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
- Blow me, Manny.
- I would, but you haven't had your shots.

170
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,900
There were also bonuses
based on winning the MVP...

171
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,400
I want an interview
with Rayburn, Manny.

172
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,900
Are we talking about "the
overpaid, overrated SOB...

173
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,100
...with the pending divorce Rayburn?

174
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,900
- I call them as I see them.
- Well, you've been crossed off the list.

175
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,300
- I knew you'd understand.
- Deferred payments starting 2007.

176
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,900
Cut the crap. Are you saying there's
no way to get your boy to talk to me?

177
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
Is that what you're saying?
He's gotta talk to me.

178
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,900
I'm saying he'd rather nail his penis
to a burning building.

179
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,000
- I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her.

180
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,100
Checkout this puppy.

181
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,400
The walk and the talk.

182
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,200
How's it walk? How's it talk?
This is the one.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,100
Are you happy with your
current supplier?

184
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,900
Any more of these demonstrations,
I'll have to start shaving my legs.

185
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,200
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

186
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,200
The big motherfucker, the little
motherfucker. Which do you want?

187
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,600
Any more demos, I'll have to start
shaving the hairs on my ass.

188
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,900
As you can see, the performance
on this baby is really something.

189
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,400
"Knife doing business.

190
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,100
Come on, bring it, baby. Bring it.

191
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,400
- Jesus Christ.
- Poetry in motion, baby.

192
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
- Two behind home plate?
- I'm your man.

193
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,300
Two hundred dollars each.

194
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,500
- Two hundred apiece?
- Two hundred.

195
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,600
- That's a lot. How about 125?
- Fuck 125. This is opening day here.

196
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,800
- Two hundred, goddamn it. Jesus.
- Okay, okay, okay.

197
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,000
Now you want the tickets, huh?

198
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,500
Anytime I can do you more fucking
favours, you just let me know, all right?

199
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,200
You in a coma or what, buddy?
Get the fuckout of here.

200
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,800
- Know what bugs me about you guys?
- Like I care.

201
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,900
You don't even care about the game.

202
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,000
You ebony god, you prince of darkness,
you Othellian Moor, you black man!

203
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,700
You look good out there! You look
good. I bet we hit.400 this year.

204
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,700
- Come on, don't jinx me.
- I'm sorry, man. I get emotional, crazy.

205
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,900
All right, so tell me, what we got?

206
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,200
Spalding wants you to sign their balls.
We got that Wish Upon a Star routine:

207
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Sick kid wants to shake hands with
great ballplayer. You'll have to do.

208
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,400
What do you think? Maybe I should
bring a ball for the sick kid.

209
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,400
No, I think a bat would be much nicer.

210
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,400
All right, here. Give him a bat.

211
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
You know it's not a good time for this.

212
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,100
- What's the gentleman's name again?
- His name's Stanley. Stanley Jackson.

213
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Thank you, Michelle.

214
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,100
Stanley, Gil Renard.
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

215
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,500
- How do you do?
- How you doing?

216
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,500
Here's my card.

217
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
Are you happy
with your current supplier?

218
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,800
- I sure am.
- Well, then let me just...

219
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,600
If you could give me three minutes
of your time, I will prove to you...

220
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
- Can I demonstrate?
- Sure.

221
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,500
If I can just prove to you...

222
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,800
...we're superior in quality because
of our fit, hand-sharpening, polishing...

223
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,700
...and strength.

224
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,200
These features, combined with our
low prices, our superior terms...

225
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,700
...make us one of the most
sought-after competitors around.

226
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,200
- That's why I'd...
- We signed an exclusive with Gerber.

227
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,400
They got the whole chain sewed up.

228
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,700
We can't pass wind in a tent
without going through them.

229
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
Sorry to hear that.

230
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
- Do you have the Little Pecker?
- Yes, I do.

231
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,600
- You really are on the cutting edge.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,100
I'm sorry we can't do business.

233
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,500
Well, you're sure I can't
interest you in this?

234
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,300
You got any kayaks?

235
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,600
You gotta be
out of your mind. Kayaks?

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,300
I could use kayaks.

237
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,800
Stanley, what the fuck do kayaks
have to do with knives?

238
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,800
Never mind.

239
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,500
You fucking asshole. Kayaks?
When I'm asking you about knives?

240
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,300
Yeah. I understand, sir.
Thank you for coming in.

241
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,600
How about you get some kayaks and
stick them up your fucking ass, moron.

242
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,700
Your stopwatch.

243
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Hey, thanks a lot for coming.
Nice to meet you.

244
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,000
Look. We got the same hairdo.

245
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,500
You sick too?

246
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Hey, slugger, come on,
shake his hand.

247
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,300
How you doing, man? You hanging
in there? What's your name?

248
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Sean.

249
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,800
Sean?

250
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Sean.

251
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,300
Wow, what a coincidence.
That's my son's name too.

252
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700
Look, I have a present for you.

253
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,900
There you go.

254
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

255
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Bobby Rayburn.

256
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Tomorrow...

257
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
...hit a home run for me.

258
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,200
- Please?
- I'll try.

259
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,000
They said "sick," not "dying in front
of our eyes." How'd I know?

260
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
As if I don't have enough to worry
about. I get a poor kid on his deathbed.

261
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,600
- Oh, please.
- The kid was dying!

262
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,000
He has my son's name.
I mean, what kind of shit is that?

263
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,200
Lucky tie, lucky guy.

264
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,500
McKinley- Everest.

265
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,700
Okay, thank you.

266
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,500
Hi.

267
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,100
- Angie, you're looking as lovely as ever.
- He's gone.

268
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,500
- We had an appointment at 4.
- Yeah, it's 4: 11.

269
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,500
My watch is slow, I guess.
When will he be back?

270
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,900
He's gone for the day. But you
can see him tomorrow at 2:30.

271
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,800
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow"..."

272
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,100
Let's s"ee."

273
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,000
See if there's anything...

274
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,300
I would prefer the morning.

275
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,500
But how about late in the day?

276
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,800
Tomorrow at 3, he's off
to Chicago for three weeks.

278
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,800
Well, that's a problem.

279
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,800
It's my son. I want to take him
to opening day.

280
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,400
You know, myself as a father,
I'm a real cutup.

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,600
I'm gonna get to the point.

282
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm trying to be a hero to my son...

283
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,000
...so if he could make it any other time,
it would really, really help me.

284
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Just an hour later...

285
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,300
...so I could fit the game in.

286
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,300
- Excuse me. McKinley- Everest.
- Any other time at all? Anything?

287
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,300
- Okay, thank you.
- It would be a big help to me.

288
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,900
Like, an hour later.

289
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm afraid I really can't help you.
He's got such a crazy schedule.

290
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Okey- dokey.

291
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,700
Drop your cock and grab your socks.
Big day today. You excited?

292
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,700
Yeah, I'm up.

293
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,300
Manny, Manny, talk to me, man.
Make me happy.

294
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,100
Wish I could.
I just talked to Primo's people.

295
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,900
- They want 500 grand.
- Five hundred? For what?

296
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,900
Exactly. Exactly.
That's 250 G's a digit.

297
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,500
Man, come on!
What is this boy smoking?

298
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,500
I tried to haggle them down.
The kid says it's his lucky number.

299
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,800
Shit. Ain't that much luck in the world.
He's lucky to be in the country.

300
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,400
I hear you. Look, it's your call.

301
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,300
You want me to go back,
or are you happy with 33?

302
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,000
- Man, it's just a number, right?
- That's right.

303
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll pick you up.
While you do her, thinkof me.

304
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,700
- That's a real short thought.
- I love you too.

305
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
- No, you don't.
- I'll catch you later.

306
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,300
Yeah.

307
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,800
Hey, Gil.

308
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,300
Hey, Ted.

309
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,200
Lose your job?

310
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,600
- It's my day off. And it's "Tim."
- Tim. Sorry.

311
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,200
- You remember Mike and Linda?
- Hey, Gil.

312
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,400
- Hi, Gil.
- Hi.

313
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,400
- You're late. What a surprise.
- Traffic. You know, traffic?

314
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,000
How original.

315
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,500
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing?

316
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,300
- Good.
- Ready for the game?

317
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,100
- What time will he be home?
- Depends on the game. Right, slugger?

318
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,500
6:05. He's not home, I call the cops.

319
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm against this.
I wanna make that real clear to you.

320
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,600
- He's my kid too.
- Yeah?

321
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
Give me kisses. I love you.

322
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,700
- Bye.
- For the record, so everybody knows...

323
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,500
...don't make him do things
he doesn't want to.

324
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,600
I don't. Do I make you do things
you don't want to do?

325
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,900
- No.
- Okay?

326
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,000
Six o'clock, Gil.

327
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,400
Hey, Ted.

328
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,200
See you.

329
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,600
I remember when Mick recorded this,
February '78.

330
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,100
What?

331
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,000
I remember when Mick recorded this
in '78. We had a wild party afterwards.

332
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
Jason Pelligrini's dad
says Mick Jagger's gay.

333
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,900
Yeah? Well, Jason Pelligrini's dad
takes it up the ass.

334
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,700
- Tryouts are next week.
- Tryouts are next week?

335
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,100
Your mother didn't tell me.

336
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,900
Jason Pelligrini said his dad's
gonna pick me if I'm still available.

337
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,500
You'll make it. Positive things
happen to positive thinkers.

338
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,300
Tell me, what do you gotta do? What
are the three whats you gotta be?

339
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,800
- I don't want to do this, Dad.
- At bat, come on.

340
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,900
- Keep the bat low.
- No, keep it high, high.

341
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,700
- When you move your feet?
- Step on the eggshell...

342
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,700
...and squash the bug.
- Attaboy. That's perfect.

343
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,800
That's what Coop used to say.
I told you about what Coop said, right?

344
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,100
- Your old catcher, right?
- One of the finest athletes I ever knew.

345
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
Where'd you get that glove?

346
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,300
Tim gave it to me.

347
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,400
Piece of shit.

348
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,700
Opening day at
Candlestick Park, 1996.

349
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,000
What's not to love
about opening day?

350
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,100
Fathers sneaking away from work,
and kids playing hooky from school.

351
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,400
For at least one day,
everybody is in first place.

352
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Opening day is what baseball's about.
How exciting is it...

353
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,600
...for Giants fans
with Rayburn coming hom"e..."

354
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,500
... after leading the Braves
to a championship?

355
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,600
Did you see that?
See the way he moved his legs?

356
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,900
- Can I have a hot dog?
- A what?

357
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,700
Can I have a hot dog?

358
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,000
You're in my seat.

359
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,200
If it isn't the ubiquitous
queen of AM radio herself.

360
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
Good morning, my sweet angel,
darling, baby.

361
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,500
Oh, yeah, whatever.

362
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,100
Manny, come on, don't dick me around.
It's an important piece, okay?

363
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,200
There's somebody there behind
that killer smile. I promis"e..."

364
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,100
...I will not hurt your boy.
I want Bobby Rayburn.

365
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,400
Bernie, correct me if I'm wrong...

366
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,400
...but isn't she the ball-buster
who had the temerity to ask my client...

367
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
...if he was honestly worth 40 million?

368
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,900
- Am I a ball-buster?
- Yeah.

369
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,100
Thank you.

370
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,900
- Whose is this?
- It's mine. I spit in it.

371
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,700
I thought your mother
confiscated that.

372
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,700
She did.

373
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,600
Play ball!

374
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah, attaway!

375
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,600
Strike.

376
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,700
What are you doing? You missed it.
Hawkins struck him out.

377
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
- Pay attention.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

378
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Blaze winds, and the pitch to Pryor...

379
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,900
...swung on and driven deep
towards the gap.

380
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,800
He crushed it!

381
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,400
- Watch, watch, watch.
- What?

382
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,800
I got it!

383
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,600
I got it!

384
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,700
Primo and Rayburn giving chase.
They converge and"..."

385
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,000
Lookout!

386
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,300
Centre field makes the calls.

387
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,600
Fundamental of baseball,
centre field makes the calls.

388
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,400
Pay attention.

389
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,100
Well, a scary moment on day one.

390
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,400
I'll tell you, Rayburn's slow getting up.
And Primo's still slow getting up.

391
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,500
There's $40 million out there
in centre field, Steve.

392
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,900
Hope the Giants have
collision coverage.

393
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,900
This will help relieve the pain.

394
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,500
- Doc, is the rib bruised or fractured?
- Neither.

395
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,300
Bobby, what are you doing?
We got 161 games to go out there.

396
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,600
Could you excuse me for a minute?

397
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,500
Thank you. You just signed
a $40 million contract.

398
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,600
Hurt yourself, you'll be batting
.100 by month's end.

399
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,300
The media'll turn on you
faster than the fans.

400
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,300
- Listen, you gotta come out.
- I can't.

401
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,300
I gotta be Babe- fucking-Ruth.

402
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,900
It's William-fucking-Bendix.
Get it right.

403
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,000
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

404
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,200
I'm just gonna make some phone calls.
Okay? Just business calls. I'll be back.

405
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,600
- Go?
- Just downstairs for a minute.

406
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,700
Mom said we have to be home by 6,
or she'll be upset.

407
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,500
Forget about your mother.

408
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,300
I got it!

409
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,100
The wind took it. The wind took it.
Kid was lucky.

410
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,200
Kid was lucky.

411
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,300
Wind took it.

412
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,100
- You stepped on me.
- Don't worry. We'll get one next time.

413
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,000
Okay, I gotta go, all right?
I'll be back.

414
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,700
- You don't have to pee or anything?
- No.

415
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
What happened?

416
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,100
Lanz hit one to right. Bases loaded.
Come on, grand slam!

417
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,800
Don't get greedy, son.
What we need now is a sacrifice.

418
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,600
A winning team knows how to
manufacture runs. Coop taught me that.

419
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,300
Know why he said the most
beautiful play is a sacrifice fly?

420
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,000
- You sacrifice for the team?
- And doesn't bring down your average.

421
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,000
That's why baseball's
better than life. It's fair.

422
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,800
Tell me what happens.

423
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,500
Now batting, number 33...

424
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,000
... Bobby Rayburn.

425
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,100
Come on, Bobby!

426
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Attaway, Bobby!

427
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,100
Rayburn look a little stiff to you?

428
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,300
I can't believe they left him in
after that collision.

429
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,900
Right. That's all we need,
our $40 million man on the DL.

430
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,600
He's playing hurt. That's a
man showing his mettle.

431
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,800
Putting the team first. Remember,
last year he hit.314 against lefties.

432
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,100
Yo, Bobby!

433
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,800
- Time!
- Oh, fuck.

434
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,800
Come on, let's play some
fucking baseball!

435
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,700
All right, Bobby, let's go!

436
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,000
Play!

437
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,700
All right, Bobby!

438
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,800
- Go for it, Bobby!
- Go, Bobby!

439
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,700
Bobby!

440
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,800
Hey, buddy...

441
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,300
...you wanna sit down?
Trying to see here.

442
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,200
Go, Bobby!

443
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Come on! Let's go with
the fucking game! Shit!

444
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,700
Strike!

445
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,000
Are you out of your mind, ump?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

446
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,600
- Hey, sit down.
- Take your hands off me.

447
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,400
- Stop pushing, man!
- Just ask.

448
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,700
- Why the fuck you pushing? I'm asking.
- Both of you, down in front!

449
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,700
- Fuck you!
- Down in front! Now!

450
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,400
Let's play some fucking ball!
You all right?

451
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700
What's your fucking problem?

452
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,200
You old busybody!

453
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,800
I gotta go, okay? I'll be back.

454
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,000
Fuck you!

455
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,000
Oh, fuck.

456
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,200
Get out of here.

457
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,600
So could you just send me
over the stats? Yes.

458
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,800
Okay. Thank you very much.

459
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,700
I'm sorry I'm late.
Your hair looks nice.

460
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,400
- I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid he left.
- He left.

461
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,700
- For the ball game.
- What?

462
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,400
Yes, for the ball game.

463
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,500
- I thought he had a plane to catch.
- Plans changed.

464
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,900
But he did leave you this note.

465
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,800
- He didn't draw a smiley face, did he?
- What?

466
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,700
The previous assistant got him
in the habit of drawing a smiley fac"e..."

467
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,800
...instead of "sincerely," and I keep
telling him it's not always appropriate.

468
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
No, it's perfectly appropriate.

469
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,700
Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.

470
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,700
Hey, congratulations, fellas.

471
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Hey, Babe- fucking-Ruth.

472
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,000
- William-fucking-Bendix.
- That's right.

473
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,400
So did the kid see his home run?

474
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
The kid didn't even see it.

475
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,900
He slipped into a coma,
and he never pulled out. I'm sorry.

476
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,100
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Like you take bad news well.

477
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,600
What am I supposed to say?
"Great news, the kid didn't make it."

478
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,800
That's all right, man.
Enough of these hospital gigs.

479
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,900
They're off the list.
You know what the bright side is?

480
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,700
You knocked the cover off the ball.
You're back.

481
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,000
The hell I did. It was a fluke.

482
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,200
I never even saw the pitch.

483
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,700
Let go, Tim.

484
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
- What do you want?
- How is he? He okay?

485
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,800
He's not. He's crying his eyes out.
What do you think?

486
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,400
- Come on, don't start.
- Don't you start.

487
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,000
You violated your agreement.
I called my lawyer.

488
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,100
I'm getting a restraining order.

489
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,700
- Don't start.
- No, don't you start. Go away.

490
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,300
- I've had it. I don't care what you want.
- Let me see him.

491
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,700
You had to bring him home?
What is wrong with you?

492
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,700
- I want you out. Tim, call the cops.
- I'm gonna explain to him.

493
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,000
- Come on, everything's okay.
- You bastard.

494
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,800
You motherfucker! You cocksuck...!

495
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,300
- Hey.
- Tim!

496
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,900
Tim, call the cops. He fucking hit me!

497
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Hey. Hey, slugger.

498
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,800
Slugger, I'm sorry. You forgive me?

499
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,300
- Hey.
- You left me.

500
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,700
I know, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

501
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,900
- You forgive Dad?
- Mom's got a terrible headache.

502
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,800
Well, that's called a migraine.
She'll live.

503
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,200
Look what I got for you.
I got your favourite pizza.

504
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,300
Gil, open the door!

505
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,900
- Gil, open the door.
- It's got pepperoni and mushroom.

506
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,100
- I don't like mushrooms.
- You can pick them off.

507
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,100
Is it true, if Mom marries Tim,
I'm not gonna be a Renard anymore?

508
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,500
- Gil, open the door.
- It's open!

509
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
- It's locked.
- It's open.

510
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,500
It's locked, Gil. Open the door now.
I'm calling the police.

511
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,100
You still worried about the tryouts?

512
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,100
I don't know.
Think I'll make the majors?

513
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,100
Of course you'll make it.
Remember what I said.

514
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,800
Positive things happen
to positive thinkers. Who said that?

515
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,000
- Coop.
- Damn straight.

516
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,300
He was the greatest player
I ever played with.

517
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,400
Gil, unlock the door.

518
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,900
Got you a Coke.

519
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,100
Call the cops.

520
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,000
Didn't you hear me? Call the cops!

521
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,700
Call the fucking police!

522
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
- I can't drink Coke.
- Who says?

523
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,100
Mom and Dad. I mean, Tim.

524
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,200
The door's locked. It's okay.

525
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,900
Gil, open the door.

526
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,900
Hey, Art.

527
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,300
I said, " Enough of this shit.
You sign the contract right now."

528
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,700
He signed it. I swear to God,
on my honour, he signed the contract.

529
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,900
Hey, Gil, got a second?

530
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,200
If you do. It's 8:00.

531
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,400
- Shall we?
- There you go.

532
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
Sit down, Gil.

533
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,000
That's okay, I'll stand.

534
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,700
Chuck from McKinley and Everest
called yesterday.

535
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,300
Said they wanted to drop
their account with us.

536
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,600
I sent Figgy over there
to sort things out.

537
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,500
You sent Figgy down?

538
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,900
- Sit down, Gil.
- Yeah, he sorted them out.

539
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,500
He did it with my opening-day tickets.
What are you gonna do about it?

540
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,900
- He didn't steal your account.
- He did. What will you do?

541
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,100
We gave him your account.

542
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,200
I gave him your account.

543
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,300
What do you mean?

544
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,300
You're not getting
the numbers we need.

545
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,700
I know. It's been a little slow
last couple of months.

546
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,300
But that'll change. I've got
a new strategy. It's gonna work.

547
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,700
- Listen, your behaviour is unacceptable.
- What do you mean?

548
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,900
- People are scared of you.
- Why, because of the other day?

549
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,600
You cannot do things like that
in this day and...

550
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
I want your reorder book.

551
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Outstanding commissions
will be forwarded.

552
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,700
My father started this business.

553
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,300
Look, perfection and principles don't
belong in business, not now or then.

554
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,700
- As a friend of your father's...
- Keep your mouth shut.

555
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,900
You know nothing about my father.

556
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,600
- He made this business.
- Your father made knives.

557
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,800
- San Francisco made this business.
- By ripping him off.

558
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,600
He wasn't a businessman, Gil...

559
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,200
...and neither are you.

560
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,300
That's the bottom line.

561
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,200
And so, in a Freudian sense, Jewel...

562
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,500
... the catcher is the father,
and the son is the pitcher.

563
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,100
that's fascinating.
Let me ask you.

564
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,100
- What does the bat and ball represent?
- Well, the bat speaks for itself...

565
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,700
... and, of course,
the ball is the ejaculate.

566
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,900
Thanks for calling, doc.
Who do we have on line two?

567
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,400
- Do we have anybody on line two?
- I believe everybody hung up.

568
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,800
Hey, man. Hey, you got a van?
Kids are breaking into your van.

569
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,700
Somebody's breaking into your van.
Stop those kids. Cut that out.

570
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,300
- What?
- Kids breaking into a van out there.

571
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,300
- Yeah.
- Here, this is for you.

572
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,300
- What's that?
- Take it. Take it.

573
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,800
- Take it.
- What is it?

574
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,300
It's for you.
It's a temporary restraining order.

575
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,400
- What?
- You have been s"erve"d.

576
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,800
Hey, man, can I use your...?

577
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
Okay, last one.

578
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,300
Good swing. All right, who's next?

579
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,000
Eleven. Let's go, buddy.
Hustle up there.

580
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,900
- Okay, pal.
- Come on, Rich.

581
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,300
Okay, watch the ball.

582
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Good swing.

583
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,700
Next one, Richie.

584
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
Attaway, Richie boy.

585
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,900
- That's okay.
- He's throwing too hard.

586
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,600
He almost took his head off.
Hey, coach. Coach.

587
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,700
- Yeah.
- Slow down.

588
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,600
- This is Little League. Little League.
- I know.

589
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,700
- Leave him alone, Gil.
- Mind your fucking business.

590
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,400
Hey, coach, mix in some strikes.
What are you doing?

591
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,100
- You're making it hard.
- I'll coach from here.

592
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,800
- Mix in some strikes.
- He's throwing strikes, Gil.

593
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,800
- Fuck it, I'm gonna go down.
- Easy, Gil.

594
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,800
Remember, Ellen's got
that restraining order on you.

595
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,900
- The bat is too fucking heavy.
- Come on.

596
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,300
You fuck with me,
I'll send your head into the outfield.

597
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Go easy. You're letting the bat
swing him.

598
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,100
- Hey, hey, come on, you guy.
- Look how heavy this bat is.

599
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Here.

600
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,900
Let go of my son.

601
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,800
- He's my son too.
- Don't remind me. Get off him.

602
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,100
- He's my son too.
- You are not gonna ruin our lives.

603
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,700
- Tim, call the cops now.
- I'm just trying to tell him something.

604
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,700
Get out of here. Tim!

605
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,200
You get out of here.
Can't you read, stupid?

606
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,500
The restraining order says
you have to stay 100 yards away.

607
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
- Tell him one thing.
- You can't come near him.

608
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,400
- I wanna tell him one thing.
- Get out of here.

609
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,400
- I just wanna tell him one thing.
- You better go.

610
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,100
Don't swing at anything.
Wait for a good one.

611
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,900
Step on the eggshell,
squash the bug. Okay?

612
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,500
You mind your fucking business.
You're lucky.

613
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,900
Just give him... Give him something.
He's a kid.

614
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,600
It's okay. Play ball.

615
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,800
Bobby Rayburn again
failed to earn his k eep.

616
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,700
Almost grounding into
a game-ending double play...

617
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,800
... just beating the throw to first.

618
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,000
When the Giants
needed a pick-me-up...

619
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,600
... number 11, Juan Primo,
}provides San Francisco with a lift.

620
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,600
And it was a big one. His two-run
shot over the left-field fence...

621
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,500
... scored Rayburn,
and the Giants went home happy.

622
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,300
That is, except possibly
Bobby Rayburn...

623
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,200
... whose lackof hitting is giving
new meaning to the term "three hole."

624
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,300
The way Primo's carried
this team on his shoulders...

625
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,600
... mak es you wonder who the real
$40 million player is.

626
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,200
Lanz came up with a big hit to drive
in a k ey run in the Giants' victory.

627
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,100
Jimmy has been a spark plug
during this home stand.

628
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,900
Motherfuck.

629
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,500
Ladies and gentlemen, now batting,
the centre fielder, number 33...

630
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,700
... Bobby Rayburn.

631
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,400
All right, Bobby, let's go!

632
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,200
All right, Bobby.

633
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,100
Strike.

634
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,100
Strike.

635
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,500
- Strike thr"ee."
- Shit.

636
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
with courtesy to the players...

637
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,600
... please refrain
from excessive noise...

638
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,100
... and throwing anything
onto the field. Thank you.

639
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,800
Forty-million-dollar man's
paying off, huh?

640
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,300
Now batting, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

641
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,500
Well, here it is, Memorial Day weekend.

642
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,600
You think back to the opening-day
grand slam, doesn't seem long ago.

643
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,900
But lately, Bobby Rayburn
has really had difficulties...

644
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,500
... and can't seem to find his strok e.
He lacks aggressiveness.

645
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,600
And you start to wonder
when you call it a slump.

646
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,400
Most superstars aren't gonna
sit down for you.

647
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,100
But you gotta wonder...

648
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,000
... when he's gonna
breakout of this thing.

649
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,800
Strike.

650
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,100
Come on, Bobby. Come on.

651
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,500
Out.

652
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,300
Now batting, number 46, Jimmy Lanz.

653
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,500
You'll be all right.

654
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,900
You still want that interview?

655
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,800
You'd let Bobby Rayburn do an
interview with a...? What was it?

656
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,700
- Castrating ball-buster.
- Castrating ball-buster, that's it.

657
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,700
- I thought I was off your list.
- Come on.

658
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,000
Schindler has a list, not me, okay?

659
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,200
When you're hitting.183,
you don't get to have a list.

660
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,700
Lock er room.

661
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,300
- "Giants' lock er room."
- Bobby Rayburn.

662
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,800
- "Yeah, who's calling?"
- A friend of his. I have to talk to him.

663
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,900
It's really important.

664
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,800
Rayburn, phone.

665
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
- Yeah, this is Bobby.
- "Bobby?"

666
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,900
- Yeah.
- Bobby Rayburn.

667
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,400
"Yes. Yes, who is this"?

668
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,500
Hello. Look, say something.

669
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,400
Hello?

670
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,100
Yo, Stook, I thought you were
supposed to screen my calls here.

671
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,000
- Burn, baby, burn.
- Come on, give me some.

672
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,300
- What's up, Dad? Gaining a little weight.
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

673
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,900
- Stopped by the doughnut spot.
- Cool. Is he for me?

674
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah, he's for you.

675
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,100
What's his name?

676
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,400
- He told me it's Bradley.
- What else did he say, Dr. Dolittle?

677
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,700
Dad, how come
you haven't been hitting?

678
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,800
How's the rib cage, Bobby?

679
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,500
My rib cage is sick
of people asking about it.

680
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,400
They say you should've
came out that first gam"e..."

681
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,500
...but you were hot-dogging,
so you screwed yourself.

682
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,000
That supposed to be a dis
or something? I hit.314 last season.

683
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,300
- That's bullshit.
- I'm telling you what people say.

684
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,400
I can put a positive spin on this.

685
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,800
- How?
- How? I'll tell you how.

686
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,500
We set up an interview,
get a piece out of it.

687
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,000
You tell the people why you stayed in.
It's for the kid in chemo.

688
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,600
You get public sympathy.
I smell forgiveness in the Bay Area.

689
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,200
- Is that exploiting the kid's death?
- Not comfortable with it?

690
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,200
- Should I be?
- I think you should be.

691
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,800
Well, I don't think I am.

692
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,700
Excuse me. I'll have a vodka
and orange juice, please.

693
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,800
And whatever the lady wants.

694
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,600
Jackon the rocks, thanks.

695
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,300
What?

696
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,900
Oh, shit. I did it again, didn't I?

697
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,800
No, it's okay.
I'm used to all of this interview shit.

698
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,100
Look, no offence intended,
but it's no secret...

699
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,500
...that you're playing like shit.
It's gotta be affecting you.

700
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,500
Of course it's affecting me.

701
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,700
I'm paid to produce.
I can't even hit the side of a barn.

702
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,300
- How do you think it makes me feel?
- Do you know what I think, Mr. Rayburn?

703
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,400
No, but I'm quite sure
you're gonna tell me.

704
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,900
I think the slump is a good thing.

705
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,300
Now, what kind of twisted shit is that?

706
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's gonna teach you
to cut yourself a little slack.

707
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,600
- You can't keep up this act forever.
- Now it's an act.

708
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,200
Oh, yeah, Mr. Perfect. Mr. No-Error.
Nobody can live up to that shit.

709
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,800
You gotta give yourself a break.
It's just a lie anyhow.

710
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Yeah. It doesn't seem like a lie
when I'm hitting.

711
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,800
Now batting for the Giants,
number 11...

712
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,900
... the right fielder, Juan Primo.

713
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,400
Sit down, let Bobby bat!

714
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,700
He's a hot dog. He's lucky.

715
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,800
Now batting, number 11, Juan Primo.

716
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,300
Now batting, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

717
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,300
Let's play some fucking ball!

718
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Thanks, Primo.

719
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,100
Fuck you, Rayburn.

720
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,200
- You suck.
- Bobby, Bobby.

721
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,300
You suck!

722
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,400
Don't listen to them, Bobby!

723
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,500
Okay.

724
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,900
Line drive to the right.

725
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,700
Don't tell me
where it's gonna go, Dad.

726
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,400
I wish we had a whole team
like him.

727
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,500
Fuckin' asshole!

728
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,400
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Nikki. The usual.

729
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,000
- Alrighty.
- Hey, Bob.

730
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,600
You guys wanna play pool?

731
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,400
- What a waste of space.
- What do you mean?

732
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,800
He hit a bad patch.
We all hit bad patches, don't we?

733
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,600
- You never hit a bad patch?
- No, this is my dream job.

734
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,800
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Please, man.

735
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,100
These guys come to relax. You bug
them, they're gonna stop coming here.

736
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,100
I know him. I've talked to him
on the phone.

737
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,800
Hey, Bob.

738
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,100
Can I talk to you for a second?

739
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,800
- Sure. You wanna talk to me?
- Maybe we can go someplace.

740
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,400
- Let me finish the game.
- Okay.

741
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,000
Primo, it's late, man. All right?

742
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,700
- Tell me what it is you want.
- I want nothing.

743
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,700
You don't understand
how things work here.

744
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,500
Because it's different
from where you come from.

745
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,900
What's different?

746
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,500
Look, when a player like me
comes into a team like this...

747
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,900
...hey, man, shit gets worked out.

748
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,500
Right? You don't...
What is the problem with that?

749
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,800
What kind of uniforms
do you have down there?

750
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,400
- Just uniforms.
- Like these pussy pants you're wearing?

751
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,400
- What...? What colour?
- Blue.

752
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,600
- What number is on the backof yours?
- Eleven.

753
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,600
Primo, what is your price?

754
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,700
No price. You already
had a chance, baby. Okay?

755
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,000
- What's your fucking price?
- Go fuck yourself.

756
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,800
- Hey, don't walk away from me, man.
- Fuck you.

757
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,600
Motherfucker. What?

758
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,600
- Break it up!
- Get off of him.

759
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,200
- I want my fucking number, man.
- Chill out.

760
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,200
What are we talking about
Juan Primo for...

761
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,600
...when we've got Bobby Rayburn where
we want him, up close and exclusive.

762
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,200
Are you ready for your next caller?

763
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,100
- Let's get another caller.
- Bobby.

764
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,100
- You guys are getting a kickout of this.
- What are you talking about?

765
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,500
I'm talking about my season is like
a bad freeway accident.

766
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,500
And you guys, you're just
slowing down to watch.

767
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,900
I thought I'd enjoy this,
but the fact is, I feel for you.

768
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,900
I didn't know it'd be so rough.

769
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:26,500
Who we talking to? On the car phone,
we are talking to Gil.

770
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,300
Hey, is that our old buddy Gil?
Mr. Magical-Conjunction himself.

771
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,200
- Is this Jewel?
- You're on the air. Go ahead.

772
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,900
You're getting break-up
on the line here.

773
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,600
- I heard what you said about Primo.
- What's your question for Bobby?

774
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,600
Is Bobby listening? Bobby?
Hey, Bob?

775
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,300
Yeah, Gil, I'm here, man.
How you doing?

776
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,100
I wanna tell you that I know exactly
what you're going through...

777
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:54,100
...more than you'll ever understand.
This number 11 thing is a fucking joke.

778
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,300
You're the greatest player
this city's ever had...

779
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,700
...and you got some hot-dogger
like Primo...

780
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,100
...giving you a hard time
about your number.

781
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,300
There's a reason
you're paid 40 million.

782
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,900
The owners aren't doing
what they should be.

783
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,700
They should be protecting
their investment.

784
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,000
Pay him. Give him what he wants.

785
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,400
If he wants a million, give it to him.

786
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,400
If he doesn't want it and doesn't want
to give up his number, fuck him.

787
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,100
Get him out. What's the difference?
Just get you hitting again.

788
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,900
- Lf that's what it's gonna take.
- They say fans don't know...

789
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,400
...what they're talking about. The public
and the owners should listen to you.

790
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,100
Bobby, why isn't this guy
on your payroll?

791
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,600
Thanks, Gil. Maybe I should have you
try and talk some sense into Primo.

792
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,300
God knows I need
all the help I can get.

793
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,800
They say fans don't know
what they're talking about.

794
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,500
The public and the owners
should listen to you.

795
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,100
Bobby, why isn't this guy
on your payroll?

796
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,500
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

797
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:01,400
The owners should listen to you. Bobby,
why isn't this guy on your payroll?

798
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,300
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

799
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,100
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

800
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,200
God knows I need all the help
I can get.

801
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,400
Primo. Primo, lots of luck.

802
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,100
Primo.

803
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,400
Mr. Primo?

804
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,400
- Yeah?
- Can I just say...?

805
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,300
Did you ever think how one man
who's doing well...

806
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,500
...might throw off
the rest of the team?

807
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,200
I'm saying, you have to thinkof
what's best for the team, right?

808
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,200
You might have to
lay down a sacrifice.

809
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,200
I'm talking about
Bobby Rayburn's number.

810
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,500
I don't know if you understand
how much he needs that number.

811
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,500
- Number 11.
- I am number 11.

812
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,100
I know, but he needs it
more than you.

813
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,500
Are you with the press?

814
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,300
You with the hotel?

815
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,600
Then get out of here.

816
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,600
Go.

817
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,100
Get the fuckout of here.

818
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,000
It's a sad night here at the Stick
as the Giants tak e the field...

819
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,600
... for the first time since the murder
of hitting sensation Juan Primo.

820
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,100
Rayburn will take his place
in the lineup batting cleanup.

821
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,100
There's bound to be questions
about that, Jewel.

822
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,800
Now we all get to wear
the number, man.

823
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,600
Come on, let's play ball!

824
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:06,800
Now batting fourth, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

825
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,200
Bobby! Come on, Bobby!

826
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,100
Fuck you.

827
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,400
Come on, Bob!

828
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,700
That's it.

829
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,100
Come on, Bob!

830
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,600
Attaway. You're back to your old self.

831
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,100
Fuck you.

832
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,900
This is the last place I'll look.
Then I'll quit.

833
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,400
Yeah, no, I've had it. I'm tired.
I mean, he's not here.

834
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,300
There he is. I found my man.
I'll talk to you later.

835
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,100
Is this how you celebrate
going four for four, huh?

836
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,200
What happened to pouring
champagne over your head...

837
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,600
...and banging some groupies, huh?

838
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:50,600
Bobby. Bobby, talk to me.

839
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,800
If the cops worry you,
they're not interested in you.

840
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,100
It's just an ongoing investigation.
Let it go.

841
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,200
I didn't ask for this, man.

842
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,700
You talking about Primo?
Come on, I know that's shit.

843
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,800
I thought about it a lot,
but I didn't ask for this.

844
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,700
You know, Bobsy...

845
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,700
...I wish five people dead
on my drive to work.

846
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,700
Five people. But wishing it
doesn't make it so.

847
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,500
You're not God,
lifetime average withstanding.

848
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,200
Yeah? Well...

849
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,800
...why do I feel so bad then, huh?

850
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,800
I don't know.

851
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,600
I don't...

852
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:33,000
This is gonna blow the hell
out of my shithead theory...

853
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,200
...but I think you feel guilty.

854
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,700
Jesus-hairy-Christ.

855
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,600
I've been wrong about you.

856
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,500
You're not a shithead at all.
I'm flabbergasted.

857
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,300
Come on, let's go, man.
I got a game tomorrow.

858
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,900
Number 33, Bobby Rayburn.

859
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,800
Go, Bobby! Bobby!

860
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,300
Safe.

861
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,600
Bobby Rayburn.

862
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,400
You're coming off
the worst slump in your career.

863
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,200
All of a sudden, you're hitting well over
.400, 11 home runs, 30 RBIs last month.

864
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,000
How do you explain this?

865
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,200
I wish I knew.

866
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,200
That's it? You wish you knew?

867
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,800
A "thank you" would've been nice.

868
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,600
Sean!

869
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,800
Be careful!

870
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,400
Don't go too far!

871
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,600
Sean, don't go too far, darling.

872
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,700
Bradley!

873
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,700
Bradley, come here!

874
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,800
Bradley, come back.

875
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,100
Go back, Bradley. Go back.

876
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,000
Sean!

877
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,700
Sean!

878
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,900
Mr. Rayburn!

879
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,800
Shit.

880
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,800
Mr. Rayburn!

881
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,000
Sean!

882
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,100
- Thank God for Mark Spitz over here.
- Jeez.

883
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:14,500
Okay. Just relax. Go on.
That's right, blow it out.

884
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,400
It's gonna be all right.

885
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,000
Are you all right, man?

886
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,700
- Just relax.
- He swallowed some water.

887
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,700
Jesus. You scared me half to death.

888
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,000
Where did you come from?

889
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:30,100
I was just walking on the beach,
I saw him in the water, and I went in.

890
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,100
Thank God, man. You all right?

891
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,000
Sean, you gotta promise me,
no matter what...

892
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,500
...not a word to your mother,
understand?

893
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:43,200
Next time you're looking
for attention, be more dramatic.

894
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,200
- Let's get some dry clothes.
- Play in traffic like the other kids.

895
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,700
- That little bonehead.
- Oh, shit.

896
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,200
- What did you say your name was?
- My friends call me Curly.

897
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:00,700
Curly. Well, come on, Curly,
let's go inside.

898
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:04,800
Elvira will get you some
dry clothes, all right?

899
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,700
Thank you.

900
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,300
- What do I say?
- Well, you know, I was just there.

901
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,400
You would've done the same thing.

902
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,600
If I lose this guy, man,
I don't know what I would do.

903
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,100
Looks good on you.

904
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,400
I don't know
about them pants, though.

905
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,300
They're yours.

906
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,600
- Can I get you anything?
- A beer.

907
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,100
Yeah, all right. I could swear...
Have I seen you before?

908
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,300
I get that all the time.
I got one of those faces, I guess.

909
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,700
You like baseball?

910
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,600
I'm not obsessed with it or anything.
Are you a player?

911
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,400
Yeah.

912
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,500
- You are?
- Yeah.

913
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,700
Barry Bonds?

914
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,300
No. No. I'm Bobby Rayburn.

915
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,300
- Right.
- Yeah.

916
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,500
- I was just kidding you.
- It's okay.

917
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,800
At least you're not one of them
die- hard baseball fans who...

918
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,500
Why is that?

919
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,400
Because those guys are losers.

920
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Aren't the fans what it's all about?

921
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,100
Shit. Tell you something, man.

922
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,200
The fans are like women.
When you're hitting, they love you.

923
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:31,200
And when you're not, they'd as soon
spit on you as look at you.

924
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,400
Why is that?

925
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:39,000
Because they don't understand that
you're the same person hitting or not.

926
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,000
You know?

927
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,200
Only person you should play for
is yourself.

928
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,000
Hey, you wanna shoot some pool?

929
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,300
Yeah, sure.

930
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:57,900
- All right. Bring the beer.
- Sure.

931
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,700
Curly, Curly"..."

932
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,700
Curly Otis?

933
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
- Yeah, that's my old man.
- No shit.

934
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,900
I was in bigs for a cup of coffee myself
until my arm went south.

935
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,400
Man, tough break.

936
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,200
It's like my old catcher Coop
used to say:

937
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,800
"Enjoy it while you got it,
then move on."

938
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,700
Yeah.

939
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:33,100
That's a good philosophy, brother.
Good philosophy.

940
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,500
- Are all those hats yours?
- Yep, my pride and joy.

941
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,800
- Could I try one on?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

942
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,200
Fits.

943
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,500
Looks good on you.

944
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,200
Hey, Bobby...

945
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,300
...did you mean it?
You'd do something for me?

946
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,500
Yeah, sure. I mean, within reason,
you know.

947
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,100
Don't be getting no ideas.

948
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,400
- Let me pitch to you.
- What?

949
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,600
Let me show you what I got.
I got a couple innings left in me.

950
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,700
Come on, Bobby,
let me show you what I got.

951
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,400
Bradley's gonna catch for us.

952
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,200
Must feel good
to be hitting again, huh?

953
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,300
Brother, you have no idea.

954
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,200
- How did you get out of that slump?
- Say what?

955
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,100
Got any idea what got you
out of that slump?

956
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,200
You know, Curly...

957
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,200
...I just stopped caring, man.

958
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,300
- What?
- I just stopped caring.

959
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,400
You stopped caring?

960
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,200
What do you mean?

961
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,100
All my life I've been working
to be the best.

962
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,200
You know?
Trying to be a perfectionist.

963
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:12,300
And I thought about it. That's probably
where I made my mistake.

964
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,500
And when Juan Primo died, man, that
completely changed the perspective.

965
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,500
I mean"..."

966
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,900
I mean, come on, let's be real here.

967
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:27,000
What are we doing? We're not
curing cancer, you know?

968
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,400
We're playing a game.

969
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,900
That's all it is. It's just a game.

970
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,600
So I stopped caring and relaxed...

971
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,500
...and I started hitting.

972
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,500
Stopped caring.

973
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,500
So that's your fucking insight
into life?

974
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,600
Just stop caring.

975
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,900
- You're pretty loose now, aren't you?
- Yeah.

976
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,300
All I'm saying is that there's
more to life than just baseball.

977
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,600
Like what? Like your house?

978
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,300
Like your bigass car?
Like your 40-fucking-million?

979
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,800
I mean, what the fuck
do you care about?

980
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,000
I care about my son.
That's what I care about.

981
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,000
I'm sorry. I just hate that attitude,
you stopped caring. I'm sorry.

982
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,700
What, do you have a better theory?

983
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,600
Yeah.

984
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,900
You got your number back.

985
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,100
Curly, my number didn't have
anything to do with it.

986
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,800
It looks good on you.

987
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,500
Thanks.

988
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:03,200
- That's great.
- I still haven't given you my best pitch.

989
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,100
- Sure you have.
- No.

990
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,400
Okay.

991
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,800
Look, Curly, I really want to thank you
for what you did for my son.

992
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,600
You know, what do you say?
Let's call it a night?

993
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,400
All right.

994
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:26,400
Come on, admit it. We're alone.

995
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,400
Admit what?

996
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:33,300
Admit you're hitting
because Primo's not around.

997
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
That's a bunch of bullshit.
Come on.

998
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,600
It doesn't hurt he's not around.

999
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,700
Come on, level with me.

1000
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,900
Level with me.

1001
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,500
Come on, I saved your kid.
You wanna pay me back?

1002
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,400
Be honest with me and tell me
you're a little happy that he's dead.

1003
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,700
- Hey.
- No, no. I'm not happy that he's dead.

1004
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,900
Come on.

1005
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,600
Curly. Curly, I already told you no.

1006
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:08,700
No, I am not happy
that he's dead. Okay?

1007
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:13,700
Okay? Can I have my hand back now?

1008
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,800
Thanks.

1009
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:24,100
I'm really tired. Really.
I'm going to sleep. Take care.

1010
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,800
Simple "thank you"
would have been nic"e..."

1011
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,400
...for a teammate
who lays down a sacrifice.

1012
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,500
Hey, look,
you need a ride or anything?

1013
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,100
I got my own wheels. Thanks, Bob.

1014
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,200
Good. Bradley, let's go.

1015
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,800
If you need anything,
just call me, all right?

1016
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,400
And I'll get back to you.
Okay, bye.

1017
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,900
Take care. Come on, Bradley.

1018
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,700
Hey, Bob?

1019
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,800
Bobby. What about the glove, Bob?

1020
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,400
Keep it!

1021
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:37,200
I remember when Mick recorded this.
December '77.

1022
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,900
We drove home at dawn.

1023
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,000
Who's Mick?

1024
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,400
A great friend of mine.

1025
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,500
- Where we going?
- We're going fishing.

1026
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,200
- Why can't my dad come?
- Your dad could come.

1027
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,800
But he has a big game tomorrow,
and we gotta pick up Coop.

1028
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,800
Why are we fishing at night?

1029
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,000
Night fishing is best. No boats
to scare the fish away.

1030
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,100
We'll sucker them in with a flashlight,
cut them up with this.

1031
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,700
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

1032
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,700
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's yours. Take it.

1033
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,200
- Well, thanks.
- Just don't cut yourself.

1034
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,100
- Hello.
- Hey, Curly.

1035
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,300
Hey, Bobby. Hey.

1036
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,900
Say hello to your father.
He's on the phone.

1037
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,000
Hi, Dad. We're going fishing.

1038
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,100
That's great. That's great, Sean.

1039
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,000
Listen, Curly, could you
pick up the handset so we could talk?

1040
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,200
Sure thing, slugger.

1041
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,700
- Yeah.
- Curly, is it raining where you are?

1042
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,300
- No, I'm far from the beach.
- Didn't know you'd take the car.

1043
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:15,500
- I thought the kid, he'd like to get away.
- Listen, Curly...

1044
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,700
...before you do anything stupid,
I don't think this is a good idea.

1045
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,100
You don't think. You're a lucky idiot.

1046
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,900
I'm not fucking with you.

1047
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,600
- All right.
- Don't get angry at me, Bob.

1048
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
- Curly?
- Bob?

1049
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,200
I just want my son back.

1050
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,600
- Bob?
- What?

1051
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:32,900
- Bobby.
- What?!

1052
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:37,400
Listen to you. You're hanging on every
word I say. This is really something.

1053
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,600
Curly, what do you want?
What do you want from me?

1054
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,600
Don't talk back.
You show me some respect.

1055
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,200
Without people like me,
you're nothing.

1056
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,600
We're the ones that get you
your 40 million.

1057
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,300
- Look, what do you want?
- What do I want?

1058
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,500
I want when they thinkof you,
they thinkof me.

1059
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:06,400
Curly, I don't know what the fuck
I did to you to piss you off...

1060
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,600
...but my son has nothing
to do with this.

1061
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:15,900
Oh, Bobby, it's not what you did to me,
it's what I did for you, number 11.

1062
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,400
- You owe me.
- I owe you what?

1063
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,100
Check your freezer.

1064
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,400
I'll hang on.

1065
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,300
- There's a surprise.
- What the f...? Curly.

1066
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,400
- Go ahead, check your freezer.
- All right, I'll check the freezer.

1067
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,800
Curly, don't hang up this phone.

1068
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,900
You hear me?

1069
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,600
Oh, my God!

1070
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,900
He finally figures it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

1071
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,600
It's really true what they say
about sluggers.

1072
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
They are really, really stupid.

1073
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:56,200
Well, I'm a pitcher, Bobby.
Pitchers use their brains.

1074
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,400
Come on, Bradley.

1075
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,100
We'll play a joke on him,
so you just play along.

1076
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,000
- All right.
- Okay?

1077
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,100
Hey, Coop.

1078
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,600
Gil.

1079
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,800
Gil.

1080
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,500
- Gil Renard.
- Yeah.

1081
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:49,500
Gil Renard.

1082
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,100
Yeah, long time no see, Gil.

1083
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,700
- This is my son.
- Hi.

1084
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,800
Come on in, fellas.

1085
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,600
Go ahead.

1086
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,800
Man, that is a kick-ass car.
You done good for yourself.

1087
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:22,200
You never see nothing like that
in the Bronx.

1088
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,000
I always thought
you'd be managing by now.

1089
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,200
- Managing?
- Yeah, in the majors.

1090
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,700
Nobody calls me Coop anymore,
you sick son of a bitch.

1091
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,500
How'd you find me anyway?

1092
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,400
I looked you up.

1093
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:45,900
Whose kid is that, really?

1094
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,100
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

1095
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:56,000
- Bobby Rayburn's.
- Jesus fuck.

1096
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,600
Same old fucking Gil. Come on.

1097
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,700
Really?

1098
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,800
He'll be on in a minute.

1099
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,800
You'll recognize his voice.

1100
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:46,000
All right, incoming call. Notify
incoming call. Turn off all radios.

1101
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,900
Okay, this is it.

1102
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,400
Bob.

1103
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,200
- Yeah.
- Hey, Bobby, you still up?

1104
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:06,600
- Bad time to be calling, huh?
- I'm up.

1105
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,300
Hey, I hope I'm not calling at a bad time.
Probably got some people over, huh?

1106
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,900
I can't hear you. You'll have to
turn the music down.

1107
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:17,800
Oh, I'm sorry, slugger.

1108
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,300
Curly, I want to talk to Sean.

1109
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:26,500
Sean, he's asleep now, but he's doing
fine. Don't worry about him. He's fine.

1110
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,400
- Curly, what do you want?
- "I've been thinking it over."

1111
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:34,500
You know, in life, life just...

1112
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,000
...comes down to one single action.

1113
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,300
What do you want?

1114
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,200
I want you to hit a home run
for me, Bob.

1115
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,200
Are you serious?

1116
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,600
Remember that kid in chemo...

1117
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:53,500
...whose life was unfair to him?

1118
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,600
That's how I'm feeling.
My life has been unfair to me.

1119
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:04,500
The only difference is, I'll be able to see
you hit that home run tomorrow.

1120
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,300
And I got a photo here.

1121
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,600
I'm gonna get it to you. And I want you
to put it on the Jumbotron, okay?

1122
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,700
- Yeah.
- Then I want you to stand up and tell...

1123
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,600
...the 50 million viewers...

1124
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,000
...that this home run
is dedicated to Gil, a true fan.

1125
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,100
- What do you think?
- I can't believe you're serious.

1126
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,000
I'm serious as a heart attack, Bobby.

1127
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,300
That's pretty serious, isn't it?

1128
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:42,100
There comes a time in everybody's life
when you have to stand for something.

1129
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,300
Otherwise, you're just
passing on through.

1130
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,800
So, Bobby, I'm watching you.

1131
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,300
If that pitcher goes easy on you,
I'll kill your fucking kid.

1132
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,400
Surprise, surprise.

1133
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,900
Hey, Bobby.

1134
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,000
I'm still here.

1135
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,600
Now do you care?

1136
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:25,700
You get in some serious shit for that.

1137
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Cops are gonna be all over us.

1138
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,500
Boy, all of a sudden,
you lost your sense of humour.

1139
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,400
- Did you get it?
- Couldn't get him.

1140
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:43,100
He's calling from Rayburn's car. We
should be able to nail him to the district.

1141
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:54,300
You're not gonna believe this kid.
Just like old times, huh, Coop?

1142
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:01,000
- You know, that's not my real dad.
- It's okay, kid.

1143
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,600
Come on, I'm waiting.

1144
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,300
I'm waiting. The signals.

1145
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,700
What happened? Did you forget
everything? Come on, Coop.

1146
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,600
Hang in there, kid.

1147
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:38,900
Bring the bat up, slugger.

1148
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:42,500
Come on, look like a hitter.
Bring it up.

1149
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,100
Bring it up. Come on.

1150
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:49,300
Come on! Come on, slugger,
bring the fucking bat up.

1151
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,600
Come on.

1152
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,400
That's my boy.

1153
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:58,400
It's all right, kid, hang in there, now.
Hang in there.

1154
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:10,700
Coop, you dickhead!

1155
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,700
Come on, kid. Come on.

1156
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,200
Go. Go. Up the fence. Come on.

1157
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,200
Come on, push. Push. Go.

1158
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:23,000
Go. Go on. Go, kid, go.

1159
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:26,500
Coop, what are you doing?

1160
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,500
Why did you do that?
We could've been teammates.

1161
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,200
We were teammates.
We could've made it to the bigs.

1162
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,700
It was Little League.
We were 12 years old.

1163
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,700
Come on.

1164
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,600
That's my boy.

1165
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
leading off the second inning...

1166
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:45,000
... Giants centre fielder, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

1167
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,900
Well, the forecast is for rain tonight.

1168
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:52,100
There's a mist falling as Rayburn steps
towards the box.

1169
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:55,400
He's been more aggressive
the last month of the season.

1170
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,300
Who do we have on line two?

1171
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:00,900
- Just a fan.
- Hey, Mr. Fan, how you doing?

1172
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,300
Wanna say you're lucky to be
in the stadium tonight.

1173
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,900
Really? Why's that?

1174
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,500
- Is that a Giants watch I hear playing?
- Yes, it is.

1175
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,700
- Is that my buddy Gil?
- Maybe.

1176
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:18,500
This'll be one of the most amazing
nights in the game's history.

1177
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,600
- "It'll be incredible."
- Really? Why's that, Gil?

1178
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,200
I'm telling you,
the Kirk Gibson homer...

1179
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,800
...Ripken breaking Gehrig's record,
peanuts compared to tonight.

1180
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,100
You're talking about classic moments
in baseball history.

1181
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,800
What's happening tonight
that could top those?

1182
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,800
Let's just say Bobby Rayburn's...

1183
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,200
- "... in for the night of his life."
- Why, Gil?

1184
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:43,300
Well, some people are ungrateful.
They should be taught a lesson.

1185
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,700
Strike!

1186
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,900
Are you calling from
inside the stadium?

1187
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:57,500
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- "Well..."

1188
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,200
You got good seats? Are you behind
first base? Can you see me?

1189
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,500
Can I see you?

1190
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:08,400
Yeah, you're waving right at me.
Have a nice night.

1191
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,000
Gil, wait. Before you hang up,
I wanted to ask you a question.

1192
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:15,500
- Trying to trace the call, Jewel?
- What? What was that, Gil?

1193
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,200
You'll never find me.

1194
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,800
- Strike!
- Have a nice night.

1195
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:25,600
Gil. Fuck!

1196
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,900
Come on, man, go get him!

1197
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,400
Play!

1198
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:34,100
Yes!

1199
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,500
Shit.

1200
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:52,100
Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.

1201
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,900
- Did you feel that raindrop?
- What?

1202
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,300
I felt rain.

1203
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,200
- The guy's not gonna be crazy enough...
- He's here! The guy's here.

1204
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:11,600
- He could've been near a radio.
- He's in the stadium.

1205
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:17,400
Look at that. That is one fine piece
of craftsmanship.

1206
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,400
- What?
- The knife.

1207
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,200
It's a first edition. See how it
says "prototype?

1208
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,500
That means it's a collector's piece.

1209
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:29,900
"Renard & Garrity." It's a local firm,
isn't it? Gilbert Renard?

1210
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,000
What are you waiting for,
a clue, an invite?

1211
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:48,400
This guy is gonna kill Bobby's kid
if you don't find him in nine innings.

1212
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,500
Ladies and gentlemen, leading off
the bottom of the eighth...

1213
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,300
... number 33, Bobby Rayburn.

1214
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,600
Bobby's as safe as Kennedy was
in Dallas. What are you looking for?

1215
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,800
Play!

1216
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,100
Ball one.

1217
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:24,000
- What, are you walking me?
- Consider it a compliment, dickhead.

1218
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:27,500
Fuck! Do you know what you're
doing to me?!

1219
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:30,500
- They're giving him first base.
- Throw the pitch!

1220
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,600
Fuck!

1221
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,600
Fuck.

1222
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,600
Oh, man, the ump's gonna
call the game. Oh, my... Fuck.

1223
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,700
Oh, God, please don't do this.
I'm begging you.

1224
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,600
Don't... Throw the pitch.

1225
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,200
For God's sake, listen to me!
Throw the pitch!

1226
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:56,700
Throw the fucking pitch!

1227
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:01,100
- Do you know what you're doing to me?
- "The umpire has decided..."

1228
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,700
... to send both teams
into the dugouts.

1229
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,200
It looks like we've got a rain delay.

1230
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:12,700
Ladies and gentlemen, the umpire
has called for a rain delay...

1231
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:17,300
... with the Padres
leading the Giants 2 to 1.

1232
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:27,800
Do you and your dad have a special
place he and you like to go?

1233
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,200
Stadium in the Sky's
our Little League park.

1234
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:34,500
My dad used to play there
when he was a kid.

1235
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,300
Is my daddy in trouble?

1236
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,600
Ladies and gentlemen...

1237
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,400
... we resume play with the Giants
batting in the bottom of the eighth.

1238
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,100
Proceed to Little League park
Stadium in the Sky, 24th and Sanchez.

1239
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:09,700
We pick it up in the eighth inning...

1240
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:12,100
...on what might be Rayburn's
last at-bat.

1241
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,100
They'll play on this wet field.

1242
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,700
The cold night air is getting
to everybody. Look at Rayburn.

1243
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:21,100
He's going to the mound to have
a chat with Martinez.

1244
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
- Oh, shit.
- I don't give a fuck what he tells you.

1245
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,500
Throw the ball over the plate,
or I'll break your head in.

1246
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:31,700
- Fuck you.
- You hear me?

1247
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:37,000
This may go back to when Martinez
pitched for Pittsburgh.

1248
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:40,500
He drilled Rayburn in his back
with a fastball.

1249
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,700
We are seeing it all tonight, Rick.

1250
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:49,000
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- First pitch is at your head, buddy.

1251
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,200
Come on, man, do this! Do this!

1252
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,100
A critical at-bat for Rayburn,
the $40 million San Francisco Giant.

1253
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,000
Probably his last chance
to get the Giants even.

1254
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:08,200
Here in the bottom of the eighth,
the Giants trail 2 to 1.

1255
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,600
- "Swung on. Strik e one."
- Strike!

1256
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:21,100
All right, come on! Come on, Bobby!

1257
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,800
Swung on and missed. Strik e two.
Rayburn in the hole.

1258
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:46,100
One strike left
for Bobby Rayburn tonight.

1259
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,900
Jesus Christ, man.

1260
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,200
Air Seven copy. Proceeding
to Stadium in the Sky. Over.

1261
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,700
- Man.
- They're gonna call the game.

1262
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,300
They're gonna call this fucking game.

1263
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,200
Two and two. Two balls, two strik es.

1264
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,800
And Rayburn down to his last strik e.

1265
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:42,300
Bobby knows he's had
two pitches to drive there.

1266
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:45,700
Now at 2-2, you're not gonna
get another good pitch to hit.

1267
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,400
Maybe, since it's damp, he's having
trouble holding the ball.

1268
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:51,900
This game could be called
at any second.

1269
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,200
Play ball!

1270
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,800
San Diego protecting
its one-run lead.

1271
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,900
Martinez readies, steadies
and delivers to...

1272
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,500
Rayburn drives it deep
to right centre field!

1273
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,800
- Yes!
- Yes! Go!

1274
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,400
- Run!
- Home run!

1275
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:43,100
It's off the wall. Rayburn could get
three if he hustles.

1276
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,600
Robinson having trouble
just getting to the ball.

1277
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:49,900
Rayburn, rounding second,
headed for third.

1278
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:54,000
He ran through the stop sign. It could
be an inside-the-park home run!

1279
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:58,400
The relay from Park er!
Rayburn slides, headfirst!

1280
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:00,200
And he is...

1281
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,800
... in there!

1282
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,700
Yes!

1283
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,300
You're out!

1284
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,900
What is that?

1285
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,800
Bad fucking call, man!

1286
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,800
- You're out! Sit down!
- No, no, no.

1287
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:15,000
I beat it by a fucking mile!

1288
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:19,800
You're out. You're questioning my call?
Sit down! You're out! Sit down!

1289
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,800
You're the fucking guy!
He's the fucking guy!

1290
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,500
It's the umpire!

1291
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,900
What the fuck is that?

1292
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,800
This way! Break it open!

1293
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:04,600
- Shit.
- What the hell's going on?

1294
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,100
Okay, okay. I just want my kid back.

1295
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:16,700
Batter up, Bobby.
I waited a long time for this.

1296
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:21,000
No, no, no, wait. No. Okay, look.

1297
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,200
- Where's Sean?
- Where do you think he is?

1298
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:27,800
Come on, where is my son?

1299
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,400
Where's...? Bobby,
where's my home run?

1300
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,500
What?! Curly. Curly.
Where's my son?!

1301
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:39,500
Where is he? I don't know.

1302
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,900
I guess he's in that big stadium
in the sky.

1303
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:46,400
I'm telling you, Curly,
if you hurt my fucking kid...

1304
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:52,600
...I swear to God I'll kill you!
- Bobby. Bobby. Be nice, Bob.

1305
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,900
What do you want from me?

1306
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:04,600
I don't want anything.
I just want you to...

1307
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,300
- I never showed you my best pitch.
- Curly!

1308
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:32,000
Curly!

1309
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:38,000
Freeze!

1310
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,700
No, no, don't shoot! He's got my son.

1311
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,200
Now do you care?

1312
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,400
Bobby, now do you care?

1313
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,900
Just a little bit?

1314
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:05,000
Curly, don't!

1315
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,600
Curly, where's my son?

1316
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:36,300
Where's Sean, Curly?
Where's my son?

1317
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,400
A simple "thank you"
would have been nice.

1318
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:43,400
Where's my son?

1319
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:47,700
Curly, where's my son?!

1320
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:56,500
There she is,
site of the old stadium.

1321
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:04,100
Sean!

1322
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,900
Sean!

1323
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:16,100
Sean!

1324
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,400
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1325
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,900
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Dad.

1326
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:29,400
I got him!

1327
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,300
What you are seeing here
is a sad turn of events indeed.

1328
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,800
Gil Renard, an unemployed
knife salesman...

1329
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:54,100
... was shot to death by the police
during tonight's game.

1330
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:57,500
Here's how it happened.
Bobby Rayburn...
