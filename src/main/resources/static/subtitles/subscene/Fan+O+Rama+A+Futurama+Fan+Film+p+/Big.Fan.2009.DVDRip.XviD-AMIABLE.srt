11
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,199
<i>Q.B. was all over the field

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,333
<i>They couldn't get

13

get past that front four,</i>

Two sacks, seven tackles,
two forced fumbles,

239
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,266
and a fumble recovery?

240
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:47,266

I'd hate to see not shutting him down!

He fucked her.

So I'm gonna be okay?

589
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,566
You sustained
some pretty heavy trauma,

590
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,132
but long-run,
you should be.

591
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:50,466

another few days for observation.

Three days.

00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:56,217
Three days.

595
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:02,118
So... so the day is...

00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:05,999

What was the score?

601
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,484
41-28.

Did Quantrell...

605
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,018

606
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,066
Yeah.

607
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:40,317
For how long?

608
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,333
Game-by-game basis.

609
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:47,084

on the investigation.

Thanks, doc.

Hey, Paul.
How you doing?

616
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,600
I'm from Midtown South.
I, uh...

617
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,617
just got a few questions for you
about what happened the other night.

618
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:18,051
So, uh...

619
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,800
- h... how does this...
- Well, it's pretty simple.

620
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,433
You, uh, tell us
everything that happened,

621
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,466
and then we, uh, we nail
the son of a bitch.

622
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,633
Put him in jail?

623
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:29,917
That's the idea.

624
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,166
How much time could he get?

625
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,633
Aggravated assault,
maybe three to five.

626
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,500
A... Aggravated assault?
That's what it would be.

627
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,833
No, it really depends on what he did.
So why don't you just tell me...

628
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:46,018
what he did,
and we'll take it from there.

629
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,250
He, uh...

630
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:56,500
Now, look, let's, uh...
let's keep it simple.

631
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,500
Why don't you, uh...
start at the beginning.

632
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,066
Tell me where you first
saw Quantrell.

633
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:03,217

I first, uh...

634
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:06,317
Um...

635
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,984
I just... I just don't know
how... reliable...

636
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,766
I'll tell you what.

637
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:23,999
You've been through a lot.

638
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,867
So, uh...
you get some rest.

639
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,500
We can try this again
in a couple days.

640
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:29,599
That'd be good.

641
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,700
- Great.
- That'd be good.

642
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,166

to come back to you.

643
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,867
No, I hope so, yeah.
I hope so.

644
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:37,283
All right.
Take it easy, buddy.

We are talking about a rich,
spoiled, millionaire athlete...

689

who viciously beat an innocent man
within an inch of his life.

690
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,967
Do you not think, we, as a society,
have an obligation...

691
00:34:56,968 --> 00:34:58,633
to hold its celebrities to the same...
What's that thing...

692
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:01,166
where instead of saying
"won't," you say "will not"?

693
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,784
Or instead of saying
"can't," you say "cannot"?

694
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,299
Contractions?

695
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,199

You just want money.

- But I don't wanna sue.

- That's enough.

- This motherfucker...

about you.

708
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,000

- You never listen.

709

- playing his Xbox.
- You never listen...

710
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,766
That's because no one ever
says anything worth listening to.

Sorry. Sorry.

1018
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:13,933
This coming weekend,

<i>our pre-destiny
to the Super Bowl...</i>

1020

1021
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:23,600
And why? Why are we riding

1022
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:26,166
to a championship
we haven't played?

1023
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,333
Because, as I said earlier,

1024
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:32,833
it is pre-destiny that we will take
the Super Bowl this year...

1025
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:37,733
