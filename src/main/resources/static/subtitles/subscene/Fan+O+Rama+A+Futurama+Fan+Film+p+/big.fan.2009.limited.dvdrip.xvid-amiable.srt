1
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:05,234
 Joe in Piscataway,
 now you know

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,133
 why your wife doesn't
 talk to you anymore.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,968
 Let's go to Nick
 in Valley Stream.

4
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:11,100
 He just got done
 shopping at the mall.

5
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,501
 Hey, what's goin' on,
 Sports Dogg?

6
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,834
 Hey, man, those Giants
 are lookin' good this week.

7
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:15,968
 They tore those Vikings up...

9
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:23,467
 You know what the key to that
 game was? It was simple.

10
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:25,200
 They shut down
 Adrian Peterson.

11
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,133
 Q.B. was all over the field
 making tackles.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,267
 They couldn't get
 their running game going.

13
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,901
 And the minute they didn't
 have the running game,
 Frerotte was doomed.

14
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:36,234
 Nobody's passing against
 the G-Men defense these days.
 They're on fire...

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,467
I can't tell you
how sick I am.

16
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,167
 Manning's not turning
 the ball over.

17
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,868
 He's doin' everything right.
 He's managing the game.

18
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:46,501
 And defensively, if you can
 get past that front four,

19
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,234
 then good luck
 getting past Bishop...

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,801
I can't tell you
how sick I am.

22
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,300
 Eli's on the money.

23
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:59,067
 Third and 20,
 he throws
 that screen pass,

24
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,234
 gave the first down
 to Ward. Unbelievable.

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,400
 They are not missing
 a beat.

26
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:07,467
 Nobody's got an offense
 like them. They just

27
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,634
 keep on going.

28
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,033
 That defense,
 that defensive line,

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,801
 and those linebackers
 are doing great.

30
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:18,067
 Now going from greatness
 to the total opposite...
 the Knicks.

31
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,601
 What's with this team?
 We're gonna have to

32
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,133
 drag out another
 two years of misery

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,701
 till they finally
 decide they wanna
 get LeBron James?

34
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:31,667
 This is ridiculous
 what they're doing
 with this team.

35
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:34,067
 Who wants to go see a Knick
 game? They're horrible.

36
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:36,133
 The team is a joke.

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,234
 I mean, we live in New York.
 This is the kind
 of basketball...

38
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,968
It's $5.00.

39
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,567
I was just in there
for, like, five minutes.

40
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:45,534
I know. It-- It's $5.00
anything up to two hours.

41
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,167
He's got a guy on the bench--
 Marbury.

42
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,167
 They paid him
 $22 million not to play.

43
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,634
Yeah, have fun in your box.

44
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:53,334
 It's ridiculous.

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,334
 This is a comedy.
 I can't even watch them,
 they're so bad.

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,901
 Steve in Bayside
 venting his spleen!
Dick.

47
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,601
 Let's go to line three,
 Philadelphia Phil.

48
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,767
 What's happening
 down there, brother?

49
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,334
 Are you freakin'
 kidding me?

50
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,133
 You can't stop the run, your
 secondary's a bunch of rookies,

51
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,534
 and you're 23rd in the league
 in red-zone offense.

52
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,501
 You may be 9 and 2, but you're
 a weak, vulnerable 9 and 2.

53
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,634
 All right? Take away
 that fluke win in Dallas

54
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,200
 and the Buffalo blizzard game,
 and you're 7 and 4,

55
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:20,734
 exact same record as us,
 my friend. All right?

56
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:23,968
 Man, I cannot
 wait till Sunday
 when finally,

57
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,834
 finally, your weakness
 is gonna be exposed

58
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,167
 for all the world to see.
 Right?

59
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,100
 It's Judgment Day
 for the Giants, baby,

60

 courtesy of Gang Green.

61
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,434
 You're going down.
 Yo, I'm out, Sports Dogg.

62
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:35,767
 Philadelphia Phil,
 always a pleasure.

64
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,267
 ...this Sunday. And that's it
 from the Meadowlands.

65
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,601
 Ed Rosen on the Giants beat,
 760, The Zone.

67
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,367
 Get your rabies shots.

68
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:56,467
 Here comes The Dogg
 on Sports Radio,

69
00:02:56,534 --> 00:03:00,067
 760, New York.

70
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,534
 I can't even believe
 how this Pittsburgh team

71
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,400
 owns the Rangers.
 In the playoffs last year,

72
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:07,934
 last night,
 Crosby's doing his thing.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,467
 Mulligan, it's like
 he's skating around.
 No one can stop him.

74
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,300
 They don't play defense,
 the Rangers.

75
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:15,567
 Their penalty killing is dead.
 They got no power play.

76
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:17,467
 And Lundquist
 only plays well on the--

77
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:18,467
 Paul.

78
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:19,467
Yo, hey.

79
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:20,467
 You're up third.

80
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,601
Okay. Thanks, Lar.

81
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,901
 Go, Giants.
 Go, Eli!

82
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,834
 Jeff in Clifton,
 NJ, baby!...

83
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,267
 Let's go to my boy Paul
 in Staten Island.

84
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,601
 He always brings the leverage.
 What's on your mind, brother?

85
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,367
Hey, Sports Dogg!
How ya doin'?

86
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:35,501
I'm just calling to say
I can't wait for this Sunday

87
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:39,667
when we finally
shut these Philly clowns
up once and for all.

88
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:43,167
I can't tell you how sick I am

89
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:47,400
of Philadelphia Phil and
all these cheesesteak bozos

90
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:50,367
goin' on
about Brian Westbrook this

91
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:53,901
and how we can't stop
their passing game?

92
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,267
Are-- Are you joking?

93
00:03:56,334 --> 00:03:59,300
You put-- You put the tiniest
bit of pressure on McNabb,

94
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,133
that guy crumbles
like a cookie.

95
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,133
 Now, you guys may
 have put some points up
 against the Skins last week,

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,367
 and that's fine, but the G-Men
 are a whole different story,
 my friend.

97
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:10,367
 You think you're gonna

98
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,968
throw for 388 yards

99
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:16,534
with Quantrell Bishop
in your face all day long?

100
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,033
-It's not easy hitting a receive--
-Paul.

101
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,834
It's not easy
hitting the receiver
laid out on your back.

102
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:24,334
So listen up,
Philadelphia Phil,
and all the rest

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,400
of you brotherly
love jobronis who've been--
It's the middle of the night!

104
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,100
...who've been talking smack
all week on this show,

105
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:35,000
get out your forks because
you're gonna be eating
your words big-time!

106
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,767
 I love his passion.
 Thanks, Paul.

107
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,400
Thanks, Sports Dogg.
You the man.

108
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you mind?

109
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,300
Yes, I do.
I'm trying to sleep.

110
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,067
Hey, I'm--
I'm off. Okay?

111
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,033
You try sleeping
with that racket.

112
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,567
I'm off.

113
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,067
All night
with the calls.

114
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,267
Go to bed, Mom.

115
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,133
What kind
of thing is that
for a grown man?

116
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm quiet.

117
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,234
That's quiet by you?

118
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,968
Yakking away
like some kind of--
I'm quiet!

119
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,934
I'm quiet,
I'm quiet,
I'm quiet!

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Dude, you were on fire.

121
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:09,400
I f--

122
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,834
feel like it needed
to be said.

123
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:15,501
 The part about how they
 should get out their forks
 'cause they're

124
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,567
gonna be eating their words?
That's fuckin' beautiful.

125
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,767
Yeah. I guess
I just have a gift.

126
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:23,200
I wish I could do that.

127
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,501
Do it.

128
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,801
I'd be too nervous.

129
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,901
 It's easy.

130
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:28,901
 For you.

131
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,834
What time you wanna
go tomorrow?

132
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,400
I'll pick you up
around 10?

133
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:36,501
Cool.

134
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,400
All right.
Get some sleep. Big day.

135
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:43,267
Uhh.

137
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,033
 * Oh, oh, oh *

138
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,033
 * Ooh de bah ooh poo pah doo *

139
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:14,567
 * They call me the most *

140
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:20,400
 * Oh ooh poo-pah-doo, now *

141
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,968
 * They call me the most *

142
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,100
 * And I won't stop tryin' *

143
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,167
 * Till I create
 a disturbance *

144
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:29,934
 * In your mind *

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,901
 * Oh oh oh *

146
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:35,434
 * Eighth place goin'

147
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,534

 * Oh, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma,
 ma, ma, man *

149
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,400
 * Goin' to
 the old man, yeah *

150
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,367
 * I said I won't stop tryin' *

151
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:49,701
 * Till I create
 a disturbance
 in your mind *

152
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:50,834
Whoo!

153
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,234
Whoo!

154
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,234
Here we go!
Here we go!

155
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,067
-Here we go!
-Oh, yeah!

156
00:07:00,634 --> 00:07:01,567
Yeah!

157
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:03,634
Yeah.

158
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,400
Whoo-ee!

159
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,734
-Whoo!
-Yeah!

161
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:37,300
Oh, forced to scramble!

162
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,167
Here we go. Giants!

164
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,467
Here we go! Giants!

165
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,734
Giants.
Bishop with the sack!

166
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:56,000
Bishop with the sack!
What a play by Strahan!

167
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,901
Hey. Oh. Let's--
We should get our seats.

168
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:00,934
Game day. Game day!

170
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,234
 The Giants have won
 the coin toss

171
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,234
 and have elected
 to receive the kick.

172
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,234
 Back for the kick
 is Ahmad Bradshaw.

173
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,734
Here we go. Here we go.
Let's do it.

174
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,200
Here we go.
Let's do it.

175
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,000
Here we go.
Let's tee it up.

176
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:20,834
We're marching!
 And that's the third pass
 to Toomer on this point.

177
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,467
We're marching up the field.

178
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,234
We're marching up the field!

179
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,701
We're marching
up the field!
Whoo!

180
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:27,734
Whoo!

181
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,601
Yeah!
 Giants, first down.

182
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,534
 And the Eagles...

183
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:33,367
Come on, ref!

184
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:34,868
You--
Yeah!

185
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,667
Run the football!
Come on!

186
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,167
They got no answer
for us!

187
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:40,400
That's right. Yeah,
go to your fuckin'
huddle!

188
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:42,534
Ohh!

189
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,434
How the fuck is
that not called?

190
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,734
 That is a ball you
 just can't drop.

191
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,801
 It is right--

192
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:51,067
 Oh, there's a flag
 on the play.

193
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:54,033
 45 finally brought down
 by Quantrell Bishop.

194
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,934
Yeah!
Oh!
 Second sack
 of the day for Bishop.

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,567
You show me
nothing!
You suck!

196
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,667
You suck!
Throw the fuckin' flag!

198
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:04,100
 And that's a flag
 on the play.

199
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:11,133
 15! 10! 5! Touchdown!

200
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,367
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

201
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:15,467
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

202
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:19,167
 Oh, man, am I feeling
 good tonight.

203
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:22,033
 I know you're not talking
 about the Knicks, Romeo.

204
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,334
 Ha ha. Yeah, boy. I'm talking
 about the Giants, baby.

205
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,234
 We rocked that field--
Hello?

206
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,501
Can I pay?

207
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,033
Sorry. Sorry.

208
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,200
 He's running for his life.

209
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,100
 This game was over
 in the second quarter.

210
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:36,200
 They should have just
 stayed in the locker room

211
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:37,901
 and gotten on the bus
 and gone to the airport.

212
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,734
 They had no chance
 in the second half

213
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:41,467
 against Bishop
 and that defense.
Hello.

214
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:42,534
You calling?

215
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,234
In a minute.

216
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,667
 You know what
 you're gonna say?

217
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, I'll probably just,
uh, wing it as usual.

218
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,300
Dude, I can't wait to hear
you put that douche bag
in his place.

219
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,868
Oh, I will.
With a vengeance.

220
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:58,634
 The Giants' defense
 right now is sickening.

221
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,534
 Look at what
 Quantrell Bishop's
 doin' lately.

222
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,767
 He's a monster.
 He's harassing every team
 he's facing.

223
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,100
 They don't know what
 to do with him. They
 can't even deal with him.

224
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,133
 Total domination
 by the Giants.

225
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,801
 I know my boy Paul
 in Staten Island

226
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:11,467
 was loving life watching
 that game yesterday.

227
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:12,467
 What do you got, bro?

228
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:14,434
Hey, Sports Dogg.
How ya doing?

229
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:17,467
Um, I just got
one thing to say
to Eagle Nation,

230
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,767
especially a certain
Philadelphia Phil,

231
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:23,801
and that is...ha!
Ha ha ha!

232
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:27,467
Just like I promised,
we manhandled you on Sunday.

233
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:30,434
For 60 solid minutes,
we dominated the line
of scrimmage

234
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,367
on both sides of the ball.

235
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:36,701
Quantrell Bishop
was in your face all day long.

236
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,667
What happened
to shutting him down?

237
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:42,567
Two sacks, seven tackles,
two forced fumbles,

238
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,200
and a fumble recovery?

239
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:47,200
If that's shutting him down,
I'd hate to see
not shutting him down!

240
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,400
Ha!
 Quantrell was
 in your backfield

241
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,767
so much, I almost
mistaked him for an Eagle!

243
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:54,467
 I love that dude
 in Staten Island,

244
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,467
 bringing it hard
 every night.

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,467
Do we have to stay
for the whole thing?

247
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,767
Paul, stop it.

248
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,534
Welcome!
Come on in. Come in,
come in, come in.
Hi!

249
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,601
Hi!
Hey, Ma.

250
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,534
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.

251
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:13,801
Oh, he's
gonna love it.
Mmm...

252
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:15,200
Thank you.
Ohh...

254
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,200
What's up, what's up?

255
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:21,400
Let's get this party
started!

256
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,467
The cake,
he's gonna love it.

257
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:25,434
Are you kidding me?
He's gonna fuckin' freak.

259
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,634
I'm so proud of him.

260
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:36,934
Okay, let's go.

261
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:43,634
* Happy Birthday to you *

262
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:49,033
* Happy Birthday to you *

263
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,734
* Happy Birthday *

264
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:55,300
* Dear Brandon *

265
00:11:55,367 --> 00:12:00,667
* Happy Birthday to you *

266
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:01,801
Yay!

267
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:02,801
That's nice.

268
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,200
Baby, that's your gift.

269
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,801
Very good.

270
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:06,801
Nice.

271
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:08,000
Look at that.

274
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,067
Right now, we're
America's fastest-growing
warehouse club.

275
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,968
By 2012, there's
gonna be 350 locations
all across the country.

276
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,267
Wow.
Costco

277
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,100
right now is crapping
in their pants.

279
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:28,067
So, Paul,
you know the offer
still stands.

280
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,267
I have a job.

281
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,367
Yeah, I know,
but I think

282
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,901
you could really go far
in about five years--

283
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:33,734
I have a job.

284
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,567
Don't you want
something better?

285
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,367
You know, what
if I offer youa job?

286
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,367
I mean, maybe
I feel bad for you,

287
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,968
stuck inside of a depressing
dentist's office.

288
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,701
How is a dentist's office
depressing?

289
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,734
Gather round, folks!

290
00:12:58,434 --> 00:12:59,534
Showtime.

291
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,601
So exciting.

292
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:08,767
I got goose bumps.

293
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:15,000
Is it working?

295
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,934
 I'm Jeff Aufiero,
 attorney at law.

296
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,200
 Have you been injured
 in an auto accident

297
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,300
- or other such situation?
-He's so handsome.

298
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:37,234
 If so, you may be entitled
 to a large cash compensation.

299
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,934
 At Bauman, Aufiero & Paltz,
 we've been personal-injury
 specialists

300
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,267
 for over 4 1/2 years.

301
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,067
 Whether you've been the victim
 of a slip-and-fall,

302
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:49,100
 a dog bite, or
 even wrongful death,

303
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:53,467
 we've got the experience
 you need to get
 the cash you deserve.

304
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:56,601
 Thanks, Bauman,
 Aufiero & Paltz!

305
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,367
 You're welcome.

306
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,434
Nice!

307
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,200
My son,
the TV star!

308
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,434
Great, bro!

309
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,868
Thank you.
That's fantastic.

310
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:14,901
Yeah.

311
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:16,968
He's another
Martin Scorsese!

312
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,167
Very, very professional.

313
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,100
How much
did that cost ya?
Couple of nickels.

314
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,667
I like when you point
because you really meant it.

315
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,467
Awesome.
That was amazing,
bro. Amazing.

316
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:27,801
Thank you.
Thank you.

317
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,000
Could we see it
again?

318
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:39,467
What do you have
against Price Club?

319
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:41,400
I'd rather not
discuss my career.

320
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:43,434
You have a career?

321
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,100
That's news to me.

322
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,167
You could actually go
somewhere at Price Club.

323
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:53,367
Yeah, like Dennis? Please.

324
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,901
He's doing extremely well
for himself.

325
00:14:56,968 --> 00:14:58,534
Okay.

327
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,767
Who knows?
You could probably
meet somebody.

328
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:04,934
Well, what
does that mean?

329
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,634
Your brother and sister
both found people at work.

330
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:10,400
Yeah, Gina
was Jeff's secretary.

331
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:11,801
He cheated on his wife
with her.

332
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,167
She's a lot better for him
than that louse Roberta.

333
00:15:14,234 --> 00:15:16,567
He's a cheat. He fucked her
while he was still married.

334
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,601
Don't say that word
in my car.

335
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,801
Which one?
"Fucked" or "cheat"?
You know.

336
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:22,367
It's what he did.
He fucked her.

337
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:24,767
For years
while he was married.
Stop it.

338
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,167
I don't want
that language in my car.

339
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,334
Oh, so it's worse
for me to say it
than for him to do it?

340
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,467
Cut it out, Paul.

341
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,701
No, I wanna know.
Is it worse for me

342
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:35,234
to say the sentence,
"Jeff fucked
his secretary,"

343
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,467
than it is for Jeff
to fuck his secretary?

344
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,634
You should only meet
somebody as good as Gina.

345
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:41,467
Oh, boy, that'd
be tough to top.

346
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:42,467
Yeah, for you.

347
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:44,701
Yeah, give me
about an hour.

348
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,467
You have to actually
date someone to top it.

349
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:48,501
I date.

350
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,501
Oh, sure. You're dating
lots of girls.

351
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,934
You don't think I date?

352
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,434
I know exactly who you're
dating. Your hand.

353
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,868
What did you just say?

354
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:58,434
You think I don't see
those tissue balls
in your garbage pail?

355
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,133
What the hell!
Either that,

356
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,200
or you're just
sneezing a lot. Maybe you
just had a very bad cold

357
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:05,434
for the last 15 years.
I'm not hearing this.

358
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:06,567
The kind of cold
where you sneeze

359
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,234
out of your
you-know-where!
Oh, Jesus!

360
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm not hearing this!
You probably don't think
I don't see

361
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,901
those doo-doo stains
in your underpants, neither.
Oh, God.

362
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:14,834
Leave it alone.
You don't like it?

363
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,701
Do your own laundry. And keep
your hands off your privates!

364
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:18,934
La la la la la la la!

365
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,968
Man, how can you
eat that shit?

366
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,801
It's the best.

367
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,000
You ever try?

368
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:34,667
Yeah.
I think when it comes
to pizza toppings,

369
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll trust the Italians
over the Hawaiians.

370
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,000
Try it.

371
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,000
No, thanks.

372
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,567
You know,
you might like it.

373
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:44,133
I don't need to drink piss
to know it tastes like piss.

374
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,367
Mmm.

375
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:53,434
Mmm.

376
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,467
You gonna give

377
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:57,000
Philadelphia Phil
some more shit tonight?

378
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:00,567
Know what I was thinking?
I let himmake the next move.

379
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,634
That's a good strategy.

380
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:16,834
Holy shit.

381
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:20,501
What?

382
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:26,501
Oh, shit!

383
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,501
No way.

384
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,033
Fuck's he doing
in Staten Island?

385
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
I don't know!

386
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:40,801
Where's he going?
I don't know!

387
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:45,734
Quantrell fuckin' Bishop!

388
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,767
Fuckin' Stapleton.

389
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,834
Oh, maybe he's here
to see the Wu-Tang.

392
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:25,901
Who is that guy?

393
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,801
I don't know.
Maybe he played
with him at UT.

394
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:37,167
Maybe that's his house.
Maybe he lives in Stapleton.

396
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:47,801
I really
gotta go to the bathroom.

401
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:01,934
Sst. Look.

402
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,334
You think he's going
to a party or something?

403
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:19,667
Mmm...

404
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,601
It's a little late
to be first heading out.

407
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
Uh, hey, so
do we, like--
 So long, guys.

408
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,701
Can't park here.

409
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,834
Okay. Okay.

410
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:48,534
There's no fuckin'
parking in Manhattan.

411
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,033
Let's just put it
in a garage. Fuck it.

412
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,033
Where?

413
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,934
Slow, slow. Slow. Slow.

414
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,701
On the right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

415
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,167
Yeah.

418
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:07,734
Shut the fuck up!
We're turning!
Go around!

419
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,334
Jesus Christ!

420
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:21,200
"18 for the first..."
Is that what that says?

421
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:24,300
That's worse
than the hospital.

423
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:27,567
Right this way.

424
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,067
20.

425
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:37,767
Each.

427
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:48,434
Gentlemen, step up
for your drink, please.

428
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,167
Yeah, uh, I'll get,
uh, a Bud Light.

429
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,834
Bud's fine?

430
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,000
Bud's good, yeah.

431
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,000
Uh, same.

432
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:04,133
Two Buds.

433
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,267
That'll be $9 each.

434
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:13,934
Each? For a Bud?

435
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,234
Fuckin' Manhattan.

437
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:32,167
Right fucking there.

438
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,033
Hi, guys.
How are you?

439
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,000
Hey...

440
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:39,534
My name is Christiana.

441
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,300
Hi.
What's your name, baby?

442
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,534
Uh, my name is Paul.

443
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:43,968
Hi, Paul.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

444
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,067
You look so cute.
Hi.

445
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,534
Oh, thank you.

446
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,133
Where you from?

447
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,868
Uh, um,
I'm from Staten Island.

448
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:50,901
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

449
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:52,200
It's your first time
you're here?

450
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:53,834
It is. It is.

451
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:55,400
Yeah? Do you
like this place?

452
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:56,634
I do. It's great.

453
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:58,634
Yeah? Do you
want a dance?

454
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:02,601
Uh, that's--
that's very, uh, nice,
but I'm-- I'm gonna pass.

455
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,234
Thank you.
Very nice. Thank you.

456
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,000
What about you, baby?
My name is Christiana.

457
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:12,501
Oh.
Would you like
some dance?

458
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:13,601
Uh, what's that?

459
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:16,367
Do you want a dance?
Oh, dance.

460
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:17,667
Can I dance for you?

461
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:21,434
Um, yes, you may.
Um, later on.

462
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,234
But right now I have to,
uh, I'm on a job.

463
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,968
Okay, I'll come back
later. No problem.

465
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,567
God, I wish
I'd brought a Sharpie!

466
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:37,834
What's he gonna sign?

467
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,400
My balls. Who cares?

468
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,734
Where's he going?

469
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,067
Probably to take a leak.

470
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:50,434
Maybe that would be
a good time to go
up to him, you know,

471
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:53,200
without his whole group
around.

472
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,367
And it would be--
it'd be casual.

473
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,033
Just two guys, like...

474
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,734
pissing...chatting.

475
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,701
Man, those hos
look good tonight.

476
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,634
Man, did you see that one
with the big Brazilian
bubble-butt, man?

477
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,000
Man, she got a phat ass.

478
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:16,267
Man, she looks
gorgeous, man.
Let's get it.

479
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:18,767
I'm taking her
home tonight.
Her and her friend.

481
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,267
Fuck!

483
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,300
Um...now what?

484
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:47,167
A drink. We buy him a drink.

485
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:49,133
We send a drink over.
We say

486
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,767
it's from the two gentlemen
in the corner.

487
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:54,200
He waves us over to thank us,
and we hang out with him.

488
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,100
Fuckin' genius.

489
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,300
Right.

490
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,934
How much money
you have left?

491
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,167
Uh...six bucks.

492
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:06,434
All right. Give it here.

493
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:12,167
Ma'am!

495
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:16,968
No, man. I love
what I do, man.

496
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:30,801
Oh, look.
That's our drink.

497
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,000
She's bringing it.
She's bringing it!

498
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:33,000
Screwdriver.

499
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,000
Who?

500
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,567
It's from them.
Who?

501
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,167
Screwdriver?
I'm good, baby.

502
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:40,400
Take it away?
Yeah, I'm good.

503
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,834
Can you see?
I can't see.
Did he take it?

504
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:49,801
I think so. Yeah.

505
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:02,100
We should go there.

506
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,501
Shouldn't they--
Shouldn't they wave usover?

507
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,767
There's no ru--
There's no rule.

508
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:12,934
There's no rules.

509
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:15,267
Let's go.

510
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:16,267
Let's go.

512
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:25,868
That's what
I'm talking about!

514
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:30,400
How many bottles you had?

515
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,868
I bought about
30 bottles, man!

516
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,067
Club-- Club QB!

517
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,267
Club U.P., man.

519
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,834
Hey.

520
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:45,634
Yeah.

521
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:46,634
Sex.

523
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:48,734
Hey!

525
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:51,634
Hey, men.

528
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:58,100
There's somebody here
to see you, man.

529
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,400
Yeah.

530
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:00,767
Look at this
motherfucker!

531
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:01,801
Yes.

533
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:07,968
Yeah, and he brought
the Nutty Professor
with him!

535
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:14,434
We really wanted
to just meet you,
Mr. Bishop.

537
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,534
Hi. Yeah, yeah.
So how y'all
doin', man?

538
00:27:18,601 --> 00:27:19,734
Doin' good, man.

539
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:20,801
You all right,
man?

540
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:22,033
Yeah,
I'm-- I'm great.

542
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:25,634
We're big fans.
Yeah.

543
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:28,467
15 sacks'll get you
big fans, man!

544
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:30,400
QB, baby! QB!

545
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,367
Hey, I told you
I have fans, man.

546
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,367
See, I told you I have.
QB, man!

547
00:27:34,434 --> 00:27:36,300
We came all the way
from Staten Island.

548
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,100
Staten Island!

550
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:43,067
With a--
With a little stop
in Stapleton.

551
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:46,200
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!
Wh-What?

552
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:47,801
Say Stapleton?
Stapleton?

553
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:49,834
Yeah. We were just...
um...

554
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,534
Were you following us?

556
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:57,400
Stapleton.
Stapleton.

557
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,801
Um, look, Q--
You following us
or something?

558
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:01,968
No, no! We-- We just
wanted to say hi, and then--

559
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:04,133
I guess I kinda
chickened out, so I--

560
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,501
Look, we don't--
They're just fans, yo.
Just fans.

561
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:07,067
Bullshit! Bullshit!
No, not at all.

562
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,834
If it's not
a good time...

563
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,567
They just fans.
Bullshit! Hold on! Bullshit!
They're stalkers, man!

564
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,834
Hold on. You
a motherfucking
stalker, man!

565
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,934
Bullshit! These two
motherfuckin'
stalker, man!

566
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,667
Fuck with me, man?
You motherfucker--

567
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:21,100
Look, I'm very sorry--

568
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,901
No! No!

569
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,834
Motherfucker!

573
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,968
Fucker, man!

574
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,167
Let me go, man!

577
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,567
 Dr. Lyon, line 5145.

578
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,901
 Dr. Lyon, 5145.

580
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:15,133
 Any available transport
 dispatcher, please.

581
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,267
 Any available
 transport dispatcher.

583
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:36,634
Hematoma. It's a bleeding
from the vein

584
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,767
between the brain
and the skull.

585
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:41,300
Fortunately, we were able
to successfully drain it.

586
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:43,767
So I'm gonna be okay?

587
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,501
You sustained
some pretty heavy trauma,

588
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:47,067
but long-run,
you should be.

589
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:50,400
We do need to keep you
another few days
for observation.

590
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:53,667
Another...few days?
How long have I been here?

591
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:55,067
Three days.

592
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:56,067
Three days.

593
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:01,968
So...So the day is...

594
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:05,934
Sunday?

595
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,033
Monday.

596
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,400
Monday.

597
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:12,601
How did we do?

598
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,667
What was the score?

599
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,334
41-28.

601
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,601
We gave up 41
to the Chiefs?

602
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,100
Did Quantrell...

603
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,868
Suspended?

604
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah.

605
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:40,167
For how long?

606
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,267
Game-by-game basis.

607
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:46,934
They say it depends
on the investigation.

609
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:00,767
Paul.

610
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:01,901
There's someone
here to see you.

612
00:31:03,601 --> 00:31:04,634
Thanks, doc.

613
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:06,634
Hey, Paul.
How you doing?

614
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,534
I'm from Midtown South.
I, uh,

615
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,467
just got a few questions
for you about what happened
the other night.

616
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:17,901
So, uh...

617
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,734
...h-how does this...
Well, it's pretty simple.

618
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,367
You, uh, tell us
everything that happened,

619
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,400
and then we, uh, we nail
the son of a bitch.

620
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,567
Put him in jail?

621
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:29,767
That's the idea.

622
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,100
How much time could he get?

623
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,567
Aggravated assault,
maybe three to five.

624
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,434
A-Aggravated assault?
That's what it would be.

625
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,767
No, it really depends
on what he did. So why
don't you just tell me

626
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,868
what he did,
and we'll take it
from there.

627
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,100
He, uh...

628
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:56,434
Now, look, let's, uh,
let's keep it simple.

629
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,434
Why don't you, uh,
start at the beginning.

630
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,000
Tell me where you
first saw Quantrell.

631
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:03,067
Quantrell. Quantrell,
I first, uh...

632
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:06,167
Um...

633
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,834
I just-- I just don't know
how...reliable...

634
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,701
I'll tell you what.

635
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:23,934
You've been through a lot.

636
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,801
So, uh...you get some rest.

637
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,434
We can try this again
in a couple days.

638
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:30,033
That'd be good.
Great.

639
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
That'd be good.
I'm sure it'll start
to come back to you.

640
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,801
No, I hope so,
yeah. I hope so.

641
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:37,133
All right.
Take it easy, buddy.

642
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:39,501
You, too.

643
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,300
 Or even a medium fly
 on a honey pile,

644
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,968
 nuts and bolts.
 Hold on.

645
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:49,167
 Don't put it in the trash.
 Put it back together,
 and it's ready to go.

646
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:51,434
 But I saved
 the best for last.

647
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:54,434
 If you have wooden floors
 or tile floors,

648
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:57,501
 you have to change the
 settings, you have to sweep.

649
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:00,334
 This is wet vegetables
 on wood floors.

650
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,701
 This could be tile.

651
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,701
 This could be waterproof.

652
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:06,934
 Look at this.
 It sneaks behind.

653
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,234
 It's not the tile.

654
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,567
 Picks up the carrots,
 the peas, the corn.

655
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:14,834
 It gets 'em all
 in one easy step.

662
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:01,334
Just put a little salve
on there...

663
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,067
Because if that stuff
gets in your eye...

664
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,400
It's not.
It's not just in my eye. 
That's what I'm--

665
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:06,701
There he is!
Hey...

666
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:08,434
There goes my brother.
There he is.

667
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:10,868
Ohh...
Hello-o!

668
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:12,767
Let me look.
What a palace.
Look at this.

669
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,467
My brother's
living in a palace.
Hello.

670
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:16,901
Not too bad,
not too bad.
Nice TV set...

671
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:18,801
All right.
Look at you.
Better than I thought.

672
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:21,734
You should get the shit
kicked out of you more often.

673
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:23,200
Jeffrey.

674
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:25,634
Speaking of which,
I've been thinking.

675
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:28,033
Oh...oh. 
That's never good!

676
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,501
What this animal did to you,
he's gotta pay.

677
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,734
Yeah. I'm-- I'm sure he will.

678
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,067
Well,
let's make sure of it.

679
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,067
Well, the cops
are investigating.
So?

680
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:37,701
So he's gonna go to jail!
Jail's bullshit.

681
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,367
We gotta hit him
where it hurts--
in his wallet.

682
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:42,501
I don't wanna be
one of those assholes
that sues Burger King

683
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,667
for 50 billion because
their Whopper's too hot.

684
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:47,000
We are not talking about
Whoppers here, Paul.

685
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:50,767
We are talking about a rich,
spoiled, millionaire athlete

686
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:53,934
who viciously beat
an innocent man within
an inch of his life.

687
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,901
Do you not think,
we, as a society,
have an obligation

688
00:34:56,968 --> 00:34:58,567
to hold its celebrities
to the same--
What's that thing

689
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:01,100
where instead of saying
"won't," you say "will not"?

690
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,634
Or instead of saying
"can't," you say "cannot"?

691
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,234
Contractions?

692
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,133
You stop using them
whenever you want
to sound smart

693
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,767
or lawyerly--
Don't be a fuckin' wise ass,
Paul! This is serious!

694
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:13,133
You should
listen to him.

695
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,267
You don't care about justice.
You just want money.

696
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:18,167
Money isjustice.
We're talking aggravated
assault and battery--

697
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:19,534
3, 4 million easy.

698
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:22,234
Wow. So now you're
a lawyer. That's--

699
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,667
Boy, the things they teach
in secretary school.
Fuck you!

700
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:27,033
He don't give
a shit about you.
But I don't wanna sue.

701
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,567
What the fuck's
wrong with you?
That's enough.

702
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,100
Thickheaded motherfucker,
you are.

703
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,767
What is wrong with you?
This motherfucker

704
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,601
does not give
a fuck about you.

705
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,200
He is in his mansion
playing his Xbox.
You never listen.

706
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,701
That's because no one
ever says anything
worth listening to.

707
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,133
Look at
where you are!
This is a hospital.

708
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,300
It's not what you want.
It's what is right.

709
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,634
You wanna live like this
for the rest of your life?

710
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,501
Yes, I do. I wanna
live exactly like this.

711
00:35:47,434 --> 00:35:49,667
I had enough of this.
Good.

712
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,267
Oi.

713
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,334
How do you get
a concussion when you
got no fuckin' brains?

715
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,634
 In the name of Jesus,
 Mary, and Joseph,

716
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:25,067
 what's going on?

717
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,467
 My grandmother
 could play better
 than that D-line,

718
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:28,501
 and she's freakin'--

719
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,801
 * When I stand *

720
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:36,467
 * Back to the sea *

721
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:39,334
 * A big white cloud *

722
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,234
 * Looking right down...  *

723
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,968
 You have reached
 the home of Theresa Aufiero.

724
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:50,300
 Neither her or Paul
 can come to the phone.

725
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:53,601
 Please leave
 your name, number,

726
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,968
 and the time of your call,
 and we will get back.

727
00:36:57,033 --> 00:36:59,133
 * Big white cloud *

728
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,968
 This is Murray Pape
 from the Daily News. Paul,
 if, uh, you get a chance--

729
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:06,767
 * Big white cloud *

730
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:09,267
 * On me *

731
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:14,501
 * Big white cloud *

732
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:18,000
 * Big white cloud *

733
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,434
 * Big white cloud *

734
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:20,634
 The Giants were the one

735
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:22,434
 that basically
 handed this game over.

736
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:23,868
 Hopefully, this won't
 be the end for them

737
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,167
 and they start playing like
 this regularly now without QB.

738
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:27,167
 But they got--

739
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:28,501
 * ...kill *

740
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,734
 * On the hill *

741
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:35,200
 * Looking at bees *

742
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:39,033
 * Licking the trees... *
 ...the time of your call,
 and we will get back.

743
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,868
 * Looking for signs]

744
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:42,834
 Good afternoon. This is
 Herb Cohen from The Post,

745
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:46,367
 calling for Paul Aufiero,
 hoping to ask him
 a few quick questions.

746
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:48,501
 * ...I love you *

747
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:52,701
 * Yes, how I love you *

748
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:56,868
 * Oh, how I love you so *

749
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:02,434
 * Oh, how I love you *

750
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:06,234
 * Yes, how I love you *

751
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,701
 * Oh, how I love you so *

752
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,601
 * After all *

753
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:23,267
 * Is said and done *

754
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,234
 * Everything *

755
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,133
 * Is just like it began *

756
00:38:30,701 --> 00:38:32,300
 * Days that came... *

757
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,067
 Hey, how you doin', Dogg?
 Oh, my God,

758
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:36,634
 I'm loving this. All right,
 that bunch of thugs

759
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:39,501
 that you call a team up there
 is showing their true colors

760
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,434
 for the whole world to see.
 All right?

761
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:45,200
 They're just a bunch of dirty,
 no-good hooligan animals,

762
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:46,734
 all right,
 from Bishop on down.

763
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:48,968
 This ain't about Philly
 versus New York, all right?

764
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:50,634
 This is about good versus--

765
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:51,934
 ...slip away!

766
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,567
 That's my boy Massapequa Mark,

767
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:55,100
 bringing the leverage!

768
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,901
 Hey! Paul, Staten Island,
 what do you got?

769
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,434
Hey, Dogg, how you doing?
Um, listen,

770
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:04,934
I'm just calling in response
to that pea-brain
Philadelphia Phil.

771
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,033
I'm listening here.
It's unbelievable!

772
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,234
I mean, you ever hear of
innocent until proved guilty?

773
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,767
It's a little thing called
the American Constitution.

774
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,567
Maybe you should look it up.

775
00:39:15,634 --> 00:39:19,467
Now, we don't know what
happened at that club.
We weren't there!

776
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,234
I mean, maybe-- maybe...

777
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,467
unless-- unless they
charge QB with something,

778
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:25,501
they gotta let him play.
They gotta let him play.

779
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,934
Not that we need him...

780
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,801
because we got the horses,
and everything's cool.

781
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,968
This is--  You know
what this is?

782
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:33,968
This is people
blowing something

783
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,033
way out of proportion,
all right?

784
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,100
And not realizing that th--
this thing is not a thing.

785
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:42,701
 Yeeaahh.

788
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,000
Hey, Paul.

789
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:10,567
Feeling better?

790
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:13,801
Yeah, I'm fine.
You know.

791
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,067
This is a good time
to talk?

792
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,300
Uh, it's not, uh...ideal.

793
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:22,767
I got work.

794
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,901
What time
you get off?

795
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:27,901
I don't...

796
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:32,000
really know how much
I can help you on this,
you know?

797
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:34,300
Any help is help, Paul.

798
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,033
Yeah. You know,
I think maybe...

799
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,601
You know, I think
I got amnesia.

800
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,033
Amnesia.

801
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,100
Yeah. Sounds
like you have amnesia.

802
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:02,534
Is there-- Isn't
there anyone else you could
talk to about this, or...

803
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:04,734
You'd think so.

804
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:07,434
A club that crowded.
But unfortunately,
you know,

805
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:10,367
everyone was either
off in the bathroom
or the VIP lounge

806
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,667
or havin' a smoke
when it all went down.

807
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:13,834
Hmm. Well...

808
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:20,601
Well...let's hope
that amnesia clears up.

809
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,234
When it does, I want you
to give me a call.

810
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,734
We wouldn't want
a crime like this
to go unpunished.

811
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,267
No.

812
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,567
 Man, these Giants
 are killin' me.

813
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,567
 I think I might have to
 start watchin' the Jets.

814
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:47,734
 This is killin' me.

815
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:49,434
 Yeah,
 I can feel you, Chuck.

816
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:51,968
 You can't tell me this
 isn't botherin' the Giants.

817
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:55,033
 You can't tell me that this
 isn't driving Coughlin nuts.

818
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,434
 I mean, it's become a problem
 that they've had to deal with

819
00:41:58,501 --> 00:42:00,467
 day in, day out,
 week to week.

820
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:04,167
 I don't even know how they
 maintain their focus with this
 nightmare goin' on.

821
00:42:04,234 --> 00:42:07,300
 The drama keeps playin' out,
 the story's had legs forever.

822
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:09,734
 It won't go away. They haven't
 made their minds up.

823
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:12,067
 The D.A. doesn't know
 whether he's comin' or goin'.

824
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:14,000
 I mean, the D.A.'s office
 gotta make their mind up.

825
00:42:14,067 --> 00:42:15,901
 They can't let this thing
 keep dragging out--

826
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:18,634
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.
 We got breakin' news
 on this very subject.

827
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:20,734
 Let's go to Ed Rosen
 right now.

828
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:22,400
 Well, Dogg,
 word has come down

829
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:25,834
 that Quantrell Bishop
 will not be eligible to play

830
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:28,133
 in this Sunday's
 key showdown in Dallas.

831
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,834
 According to
 a Giants' spokesman,

832
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:33,634
 the five-time pro-bowler will
 remain on the ineligible list

833
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,234
 until further notice.

834
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,968
 Once again, Quantrell Bishop
 inactive this Sunday.

835
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:40,467
 That's it
 from the Meadowlands,

836
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:44,234
 Ed Rosen
 on the Giants beat,
 760, The Zone.

837
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,067
 The Cowboys come in with
 the number 3 ranked offense--

838
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:48,734
 first in the pass,
 last in the run--

839
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:50,133
 led, of course,
 by Marion Barber.
We're really good.

840
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
We're in good shape.
You slide Pierce over,

841
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:53,534
you give Michael
some support, bada-bing,

842
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:54,968
we're good.
Yeah.

843
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,667
 And I see the Cowboys
 trying to establish the run

844
00:42:56,734 --> 00:43:00,234
 early and often today
 with the absence
 of Quantrell Bishop.

845
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,834
 Giants come in today, a little
 shaky off of last week's loss,
 looking to...

846
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:05,033
No problem.

848
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,467
 This is gonna be a tough
 contest and a tough--

849
00:43:08,534 --> 00:43:11,267
What the fuck?!

850
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:13,834
 The Cowboys 35
 and the Giants 27.

851
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:16,434
 And, Chip, just like we talked
 about before the game...
Fuck.

852
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:19,601
 the Giants' defensive...
You don't go for two
when you're down four.

853
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:22,200
 He had all day to pass,
 and he made them pay.

854
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,000
You miss, you need
a touchdown to win!

855
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:26,501
 ...the Giants, but
 without Quantrell Bishop...

856
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:29,701
The first-and-goal,
you cannot take
a sack there.

857
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:30,801
Throw that shit away!

858
00:43:30,868 --> 00:43:32,267
 ...way of the Giants'
 defense,

859
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:33,634
 specifically
 attacking the spot
It never should have come

860
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:36,267
to that.
 Quantrell Bishop
 normally occupies.

861
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:38,734
 Willington
 with an admirable job
 at defensive end today,

862
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:40,267
We're fine.
 but he is not
 Quantrell Bishop.

863
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,267
We only need to win
one of the next two,

864
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:44,200
 ...right from the get-go.
or they lose one.

865
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:45,467
 ...Quantrell Bishop?
 You mean...
They got, uh,

866
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:47,567
Green Bay
at Lambeau.

867
00:43:47,634 --> 00:43:49,501
We're good.
We're fine.

868
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:51,767
 ...got right in there
 and stole everything
 in the house.

869
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:54,601
 And, Chip, as we turn
 to the NFC East race now,
You okay?

870
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:57,267
 the Philadelphia Eagles
 are gaining on the New York
 Football Giants,

871
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,901
 and it looked at one point
 as if we had no race,
You know what, man?

872
00:43:59,968 --> 00:44:02,534
 but now, Chip, I think
 we have a certifiable
 dogfight on our hands.

873
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:04,367
You really need
to lay off this shit.

874
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,667
 Three weeks ago,
 it looked like the Giants
 had firm control

875
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:09,000
 of the division.
This is alien piss.

876
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:12,067
 ...walk away with this thing
 and now, all of a sudden...
Can I make a suggestion?

877
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:15,934
Drink this stuff.
It's much better for you.
Root beer.

878
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,033
 ...excessive problems,
 they might buy--
 they might be...

879
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,701
This is root...beer.
 When it comes
 down to the wire, Chip...

880
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:24,467
Root beer. It's like--
It's like earth's
first beverage.

881
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:25,968
I don't like root beer.

882
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:29,834
Anything in a green bottle
is gonna kill you. Brown.

883
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,467
 Again a tough day
 down here for
It's more natural.

884
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,734
 New York Football.
 Giants down here
 at Texas Stadium...

885
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:36,167
It's got minerals--
I don't like root beer!

886
00:44:36,234 --> 00:44:38,200
 ...35, Giants 27.

887
00:44:38,267 --> 00:44:41,934
 This is Tom Rogers
 alongside my broadcast
 partner Chip Daniels.

888
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,534
 So long from Texas Stadium,
 everyb--

892
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,133
 Boom, boom, boom,

893
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,133
 boom, boom!
 You hear that?
 You hear that, baby?

894
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,934
 That's the sound
 of footsteps, baby.

895
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,567
 We are gaining on you.
 One back with two to go.

896
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:24,601
 We beat St. Louis next week,
 you lose to Carolina,

897
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,834
 and it all comes
 to Monday night.

898
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:29,734
 To Monday night madness.
 To Monday night football.

899
00:45:29,801 --> 00:45:31,767
 The last game
 of the season,

900
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:33,834
 Giants versus the Eagles
 at the Linc,

901
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:35,400
 where we're gonna
 frickin' destroy your--

905
00:45:52,234 --> 00:45:53,968
Fuckin' asshole.

907
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:57,334
How you doing,
Paul?

908
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,467
Hey!

909
00:46:58,534 --> 00:47:00,267
Ohh...
It's cold out, huh?

910
00:47:00,334 --> 00:47:01,434
Mmhh!

911
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:02,901
Coffee?
Please.

912
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:07,601
Thank you.

913
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:10,801
Well...gotta be honest.

914
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:14,901
Did not expect
to hear from you.

915
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:16,567
 Well...

916
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,734
So.

917
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:23,000
What do you got for me?

918
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:25,467
Well, you know,
I've been, uh...

919
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:30,367
...thinkin' a lot about...
what happened, and--

920
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:31,934
and, you know...

921
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,567
trying to remember.

922
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:34,968
Bring it.

923
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:36,567
I just...

924
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:39,133
I don't think...

925
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,701
that I'll, uh...

926
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:43,701
be able...

927
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:52,100
...to r-remember stuff.
I've been trying, you know,

928
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:56,701
really hard, thinking about...
what happened, and I ju--

929
00:47:56,767 --> 00:47:59,267
I just can't--
I-- 
I just can't.

930
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:04,767
Can't remember
or won't remember?

931
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:09,133
I've been trying...
like I said...
um, to remember.

932
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,167
I just-- I can't...

933
00:48:11,234 --> 00:48:12,567
Can't or won't?

934
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,501
Paul.

935
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,601
I'm sorry.

938
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:37,834
Coulda told me this
over the fuckin' phone.

941
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:23,701
Mmphh...

945
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,334
Bro, you okay?

946
00:49:38,868 --> 00:49:39,801
So, how you
feeling, bro?

948
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:44,033
I'm pretty good.
Pretty good.

949
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,567
What'd
the doctor say?

950
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:48,601
Oh, they don't know
what happened.

951
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,067
They did
another CAT scan?

952
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:54,167
Yeah. It didn't
show anything.

953
00:49:54,234 --> 00:49:56,334
Oh, really? It didn't
pick up the fist prints?
They're not related.

954
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,701
Yeah. Sure.

955
00:49:57,767 --> 00:50:00,000
You don't know that.
Are you sniffing
glue again?

956
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,701
Is this like some kind of
no-snitching thing?
Like the brothers?

957
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,634
Oh, yeah. I heard the charges
were dropped. I'm sorry. You
must be really upset about that.

958
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,033
Come on, Jeff.

959
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,133
What? I'm sympathizing.
Well, stop.

960
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,601
He needs to hear this.

961
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,334
He needs his rest.
He needs to get better.

962
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,067
Look at you.
He's right.

963
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:16,200
Like a jadrool.
Oh, please be quiet.

964
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:17,634
Fuckin' jadrool.
Oh, my God.

965
00:50:17,701 --> 00:50:19,400
You're not gonna
get through to him.

966
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:25,767
Nobody can.

971
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:44,801
Sports Dogg.
 Name and location.

972
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:47,067
Yeah. Yeah, hey, Lar, it--
it's Paul from Staten Island.

973
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:49,367
 Hey, Paul. I got five
 in front of you. Hang tight.
Okay. Okay.

974
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:50,868
 Shouldn't
 be too bad.
Okay, great.

975
00:50:50,934 --> 00:50:53,367
  Every time
 the Knicks manage--

977
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:57,000
 Hey, kitty cat...

978
00:50:57,067 --> 00:50:59,000
 Get off the porch!

979
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:02,100
 You're in The Zone
 with the Sports Dogg,

980
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:04,701
 on 760 Sports Radio,
 New York.

981
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:06,000
 New York...

982
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:07,300
 Hey,
 Paul From Staten Island,

983
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:08,367
 what do we
 got tonight?
Hey! Hey!

984
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:10,834
What's up, Dogg?
Um, I gotta tell you,

985
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,868
I am feeling
good tonight

986
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:15,334
because
in a little less
than 48 hours,

987
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,367
we are gonna
brutally shatter
any flicker of hope

988
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:21,467
the cheesesteaks had going.

989
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:23,901
We've been messing
with them the last few weeks,

990
00:51:23,968 --> 00:51:26,501
letting 'em get back in it
a little, making 'em think

991
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:28,334
they had
a chance of catching us

992
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,534
just so we can see
the look on their faces

993
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:32,534
when they come up short.

994
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:35,801
-Quantrell's back, baby,
and he is g--
-Paul!

995
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:40,400
Quantrell is back, baby,

996
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:44,133
and he is ready to make up
for some lost time

997
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,601
against the Panthers.

998
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:49,067
You better hope
the scoreboard is broken
down there in St. Louis

999
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:52,400
because the Eagles
are gonna be so crushed

1000
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:55,234
when they look up at it and see
the Giants-Panthers score.

1001
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,601
They're not even gonna
be able to play.

1002
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:02,167
It's not even-- even gonna
come down to the head-to-head
in week 17.

1003
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:04,834
We're gonna wrap up the East
in a nice little bow

1004
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:07,534
-this coming--
-People live here!

1005
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:09,000
Sorry. Sorry.

1006
00:52:10,234 --> 00:52:13,868
This coming weekend,
after which, we will follow

1007
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:16,300
 our pre-destiny
 to the Super Bowl

1008
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:20,567
 as we ride the victory bus
 to the championship.

1009
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:23,534
And why? Why are we riding
in the victory bus

1010
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:26,100
to a championship
we haven't played?

1011
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,267
Because, as I said earlier,

1012
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:32,767
it is pre-destiny that we will
take the Super Bowl this year

1013
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:37,667
while at the same time
waving goodbye

1014
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,000
to...the...Eagles.

1015
00:52:40,067 --> 00:52:42,300
 Thanks, Paul. Now,
 that's a G-Men fan.

1016
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,834
Oh-- Thank you.
 Thanks, buddy.

1017
00:52:43,901 --> 00:52:46,767
All ri-- Okay. Thanks,
Sports Dogg. Thank you.

1021
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:03,767
Boom.

1022
00:53:06,334 --> 00:53:10,767
[makes soft flying sound]

1023
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:12,868
 Delhomme in the shotgun...

1024
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:15,801
Big stop, big stop,
big stop, big stop.

1025
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:18,434
Go get him!
Get him! Fuck!
 ...breaks into a wide open...

1026
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:20,133
 ...hauls it in
 at the 31 yard line...

1027
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,567
He had all day
back there.

1028
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:23,300
 And here
 come the Panthers...

1029
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,367
That's all right.

1030
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,467
The Panthers
always self-destruct.

1031
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:28,133
 ...right out of the air
 into his hands

1032
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,601
 and another first down.

1033
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,067
 That's the sixth ball
 he's caught today,

1034
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:33,300
 and we're not even
 in the second half.

1035
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:35,300
 Steve Smith,
 one of the players
 Coach Coughlin said

1036
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,901
 the Giants had to stop.
 The Giants with no answer--

1037
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:41,234
 Jim Trainor, saying so long
 from Giants Stadium.

1038
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,167
 Final score:
 Panthers 28, Giants 7--

1039
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:50,234
You can't blame
the defense for this one.

1040
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:57,067
Panthers
got some weapons.

1041
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,167
Quantrell played like shit.

1042
00:54:02,901 --> 00:54:04,234
Well, he was
double-teamed.

1043
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:10,434
He was rusty.

1044
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:15,634
 Tied for first place!

1046
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,033
 Tied for first place!

1048
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:22,367
 Tied for first place!

1050
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,801
 Hey, oh, oh,
 and one more thing
 I'd like to add.

1051
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:28,968
 Tied for first place!

1053
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:49,067
Huh.

1054
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:57,133
What's so funny?

1055
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,501
You must have the world's
biggest collection
of Chinese packets.

1056
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,234
It's a sin to throw out food.

1057
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,767
 My mother,
the soy-sauce squirrel.

1058
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,734
It's a real riot,
not being wasteful.

1059
00:55:26,834 --> 00:55:29,267
You know what's a riot?

1060
00:55:29,334 --> 00:55:32,100
Is you spending 20 years

1061
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,868
collecting
all these sauce packets

1062
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:35,934
that you're never
gonna use. That's a riot.

1063
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,734
You're a sick boy, you know
that, Paul? You need help.

1064
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:41,601
Yeah. And you need
6,000 egg rolls.

1065
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,400
To put all that stuff on!

1070
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,300
Hello?

1071
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:05,300
 Good evening.
 Is, uh, Paul home?

1072
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:07,434
Uh, may I say who's calling?

1073
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:10,801
 This is Murray Pape.
 I'm calling
 from the Daily News.

1074
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,467
Uh, he's not here right now.
May I take a message?

1075
00:56:13,534 --> 00:56:16,634
 Yeah. I'd just
 like to ask him
 a few quick questions...

1076
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:18,067
 about the lawsuit.

1077
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:20,400
 If you could, I'd
 really appreciate--
Lawsuit?

1078
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:42,167
Yeah. Excuse me.

1079
00:56:42,234 --> 00:56:43,534
Paul, what the fuck?

1080
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,834
Paul. Paul. Paul.

1081
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:49,634
Hello? Hello?
Paul. Paul. Paul.

1082
00:56:52,434 --> 00:56:56,334
"In an unexpected
turn of events,
the lawyer for alleged--"

1083
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,234
I'm taking
a fuckin' dump here!
"The lawyer

1084
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,834
"for alleged Quantrell Bishop
beating victim Paul Aufiero

1085
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:04,968
yesterday filed
a $77 million lawsuit--"

1086
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:07,434
Can we discuss this
after I wipe my ass?

1087
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,167
"...against the star
linebacker in federal court

1088
00:57:09,234 --> 00:57:10,834
on behalf of his client"?

1089
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:12,901
Jeff, what the fuck?
I'm acting
in your best interests.

1090
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:14,334
You're not seeing
things clearly here.

1091
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,901
You have no right.
I have a right
if you're my brother

1092
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:18,968
and you're not mentally
competent to make decisions
for yourself.

1093
00:57:19,033 --> 00:57:21,300
I'm mentally competent!
You're a 36-year-old man

1094
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:22,901
who lives home
with his mother,

1095
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:24,801
who depends on her for food,
for laundry,

1096
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:26,901
and countless basic fuckin'
life necessities. All right?

1097
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:29,767
On paper you're basically
a fuckin' vegetable!
Oh, fuck you!

1098
00:57:29,834 --> 00:57:31,100
It's true!
You can't do this!

1099
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:33,033
I just did.
I--

1100
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,334
Where the fuck
did you get $77 million
from?

1101
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,033
I calculated it.
Yeah, outta your ass.

1102
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,367
I know you're a fan
of this guy, but you gotta
stop looking at him

1103
00:57:40,434 --> 00:57:42,701
as some kind of fuckin' hero
and start looking at him

1104
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:45,133
as some big, black,
moulinyan jack-off asshole

1105
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,968
that gave you brain damage!
Hey, my brain's fine.

1106
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:48,100
Yeah.
You--

1107
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,334
It was an accident.

1108
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,801
The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.
A misunderstanding?

1109
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:54,567
He was drunk!
That's no excuse.

1110
00:57:54,634 --> 00:57:57,934
He-- I was bothering him.
Okay? He-- He was out

1111
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,968
trying to have a good time
with his friends.
Do you hear yourself?

1112
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:01,567
Do you actually
hear yourself?

1113
00:58:01,634 --> 00:58:03,000
Lots of people
get beat up every day.

1114
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:04,534
I don't see you out there
suing for them.

1115
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:06,100
Well, none of them
are my brother. Okay?

1116
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,567
And for what it's worth, the
whole family supports it. Okay?

1117
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:11,400
Gina, Mom, Dennis,
Christine, everybody.
For what it's worth,

1118
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:12,534
I'm not gonna
let you do it.

1119
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:14,133
Go ahead, stop me.
I will.

1120
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,501
Go for it.

1121
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:19,767
Can I finish
my shit now?

1124
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:31,801
Can I borrow your Internet?

1125
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:47,934
Maybe "Stopping
a lawsuit"?

1126
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,434
Man, they usually have
everything on there.

1127
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:06,467
Maybe the lawyers don't want
that information public.

1128
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,868
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1129
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:25,767
 They're gonna go down
 with Yankees up

1130
00:59:25,834 --> 00:59:28,434
 3-zip in the ALCS
 losing to the Red Sox.

1131
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:30,000
 If they blow this game
 in Philly,

1132
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,167
 they're never gonna
 live it down in New York.

1133
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:33,801
 Let's go to line 3.
 What's up?

1134
00:59:33,868 --> 00:59:35,601
 Hey, hey, Sports Dogg,
 how ya doin'?

1135
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:37,200
 It's Philadelphia Phil
 calling here.

1136
00:59:37,267 --> 00:59:39,901
 Look, I'm calling in tonight
 with a shocking revelation.

1137
00:59:39,968 --> 00:59:42,267
 All right, it's
 about the Quantrell Bishop
 situation.

1138
00:59:42,334 --> 00:59:44,133
 As you might know
 from the news,

1139
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,734
 the name of the jerk-off
 that they beat up
 is Paul Aufiero.

1140
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:51,167
 All right? And what
 you might not know is
 I have a good authority

1141
00:59:51,234 --> 00:59:53,701
 that Paul Aufiero
 is none other than...

1142
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:55,200
 * Da-da-da-da-
 da-da-da-da *

1143
00:59:55,267 --> 00:59:57,868
 Paul from frickin'
 Staten Island.

1144
00:59:57,934 --> 01:00:00,601
 You don't know that, Phil.
 We don't give out full names
 on the air here.

1145
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:02,734
 Yeah, but you do
 on the Sports Dogg

1146
01:00:02,801 --> 01:00:04,868
 website, all right? And
 I was on it last night,

1147
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,234
 my friend. And on the
 Caller of the Month page,

1148
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,067
 I saw the name
 from November 2006--

1149
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:11,767
-Paul Aufiero.
-Paul.

1150
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:14,434
 from Ellingtonville,
 Staten Island. All right?

1151
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:16,000
 Do you understand
 what I'm saying?

1152
01:00:16,067 --> 01:00:18,000
 Are you putting two and two
 together, my friend?

1153
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:20,701
 All right, I clicked on his
 profile-- favorite team,

1154
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:22,968
 the Giants.
 Favorite athlete--

1155
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:24,767
 Quantrell Bishop.
Paul!

1156
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:26,968
 Favorite food,
 roast Eagle.

1157
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:28,868
 It's him!
 All right?

1158
01:00:28,934 --> 01:00:29,968
You listening?
 Paul from Staten Island

1159
01:00:30,033 --> 01:00:31,734
 got beat up
 by his favorite player,

1160
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:32,801
 and now he's suing him

1161
01:00:32,868 --> 01:00:35,133
 for 77 million
 freakin' dollars?!

1162
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,868
 Are you kidding me?
Fuckin' piece-of-shit
scumbag.

1163
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:37,868
 Can you believe that?

1164
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,868
 But I feel bad
 for you, buddy.

1165
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:41,267
 I do. You got dumped.

1166
01:00:41,334 --> 01:00:42,968
 All alone, no team.

1167
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:45,267
 That's why I wanna
 personally invite
 you to switch over.

1168
01:00:45,334 --> 01:00:47,501
 I am giving you
 an invitation
 to switch over.

1169
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:49,934
 Leave the dark side
 and join the

1170
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,968
 Eagle Nation.
 You can start this Monday

1171
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:55,000
 night at Sharkey's
 on Passyunk, South Philly,

1172
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:57,167
 where me and the rest
 of my Eagle brothers

1173
01:00:57,234 --> 01:00:59,667
 will bewatching us
 crush theMidgets

1174
01:00:59,734 --> 01:01:02,200
 and take the Eastern Crown!
 Do you understand? Come--

1175
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,267
Hey, Paul, how you doin'?
Adam Feuerstein, Newsday.

1176
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:18,267
Can I ask you
a few questions?
Not now.

1177
01:01:18,334 --> 01:01:20,400
Um...Paul? How
does it feel like

1178
01:01:20,467 --> 01:01:22,434
to get beat up
by your hero?

1179
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:25,267
Is it true that you're
a lifelong die-hard--
Leave me alone!

1180
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:26,267
Paul!

1181
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:28,634
Paul!

1182
01:01:42,934 --> 01:01:45,267
 Say that I'm
 a Rangers fan,

1183
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,434
 but it's more
 like I'm a

1184
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:48,133
 Rangers endurer, like--

1185
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,300
 It's like I'm going
 to a funeral every game,

1186
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:52,767
 and last night
 was no different.

1187
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,634
 I mean, I think
 if they can wear boots...

1188
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:57,434
Uh, $5.00.

1189
01:01:57,501 --> 01:02:00,200
 I mean,
 what is that? Are they even
 playing hockey anymore?

1190
01:02:00,267 --> 01:02:02,033
So you still gonna
be rooting for 'em
Monday night?

1193
01:02:12,901 --> 01:02:14,300
 This is Murray Pape.

Hello, Mr. Pape.

1200
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,000
This is Paul Aufiero.

1201
01:02:28,067 --> 01:02:30,300
I'm calling
to let you know

1202
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:33,334
that I'm planning to hold
a press conference

1203
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,968
to set the record straight

1204
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:39,300
on my situation regarding
Quantrell Bishop.

1205
01:02:39,367 --> 01:02:42,234
The press conference
will occur tomorrow night

1206
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,133
at around 11:30 p.m.

1207
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,968
or approximately
a few minutes after

1208
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:54,000
on the Sports Dogg program
on The Zone.

1209
01:02:54,067 --> 01:02:57,100
Please pass word
along to your coworkers

1210
01:02:57,167 --> 01:03:00,067
or any other people
in the media

1211
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:03,501
you feel this might be
of interest to.

1212
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:05,200
Thank you very much.

1213
01:03:05,267 --> 01:03:07,701
Sincerely,
Paul Aufiero.

1217
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:20,434
Sports Dogg.
 Name and location.

1218
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:22,200
Hey. Yeah, it's--
it's, uh,

1219
01:03:22,267 --> 01:03:23,634
Paul from Staten Island.

1220
01:03:23,701 --> 01:03:27,367
 Paul. Hey, uh, what's,
 uh, what's goin' on?

1221
01:03:27,434 --> 01:03:30,467
Uh, listen. Could you--
Could you, uh, get me on
really quick?

1222
01:03:31,634 --> 01:03:33,434
 Yeah, hang on
 a second.
Okay.

1223
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:34,634
 Joe from Staten Island.

1224
01:03:34,701 --> 01:03:36,033
 First time, long time,
 all right?

1225
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,534
 What's up, Dogg? Listen -

1226
01:03:37,601 --> 01:03:39,067
 They couldn't win a game

1227
01:03:39,133 --> 01:03:41,100
 if their life depended on it.

1228
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:43,601
 What kind of management
 do they have there?

1229
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:46,100
 I'd rather watch the high
 school teams in my area

1230
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:48,100
 than go and watch these--

1231
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:49,534
 Paul?
 You're up next.

1232
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:50,601
Yeah, okay,
thanks.

1233
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:52,234
 This is a comedy!
 We live in--

1234
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:53,834
 Yeah, I'd agree with that.
 Good job, Chuck.

1235
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:55,501
 I can dig it.

1236
01:03:55,567 --> 01:03:58,000
 Are you kidding me?
 Oh, this is gonna
 be a huge call.

1237
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:02,734
 Line one, a world exclusive,
 Paul from Staten Island.

1238
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:04,367
Hey, Sports Dogg.
How you doing?

1239
01:04:04,434 --> 01:04:05,801
 Hey! What's up,
 Paul, man?

1240
01:04:05,868 --> 01:04:07,801
 A lot of people have been
 talkin' about you, brother.

1241
01:04:07,868 --> 01:04:10,434
I know. And, uh,
I just wanted to say...

1242
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:13,133
a-- a, uh, a lot of people

1243
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,234
have been talking
about me these days,

1244
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:17,267
and most of it is wrong.

1245
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:20,467
So it's time I cleared
the record straight.

1246
01:04:20,534 --> 01:04:23,601
First off, with regarding
the alleged incident

1247
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,868
between me
and Quantrell Bishop

1248
01:04:25,934 --> 01:04:29,734
on November 30th,
this was not an attack.

1249
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:31,934
-It was an unfortunate
misunder--
-Paul.

1250
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,934
It was an unfortunate
misunderstanding

1251
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,534
between the two of us.

1252
01:04:37,601 --> 01:04:39,300
He did nothing--
Who are you
talking to?

1253
01:04:40,868 --> 01:04:43,968
He did nothing wrong,
and I have no plans to sue.

1254
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:46,300
The lawsuit
was accidentally filed

1255
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:48,100
by a person in my family

1256
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,000
-who misunderstood the situ--
-Paul, I have had it.

1257
01:04:52,734 --> 01:04:54,534
Uh, get off the phone,
please?

1258
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:57,167
 I have to be up
 at 7:30.

1259
01:04:57,234 --> 01:04:58,501
Hang up.

1260
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:00,334
 Who is that?

1261
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,667
 I have a doctor's
 appointment at 9.

1262
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:04,667
Okay.

1263
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,467
 It's surgery, Paul.

1264
01:05:06,534 --> 01:05:07,901
 Is that his mother?

1265
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:10,234
 They're removing
 my corn.

1266
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,167
 If I don't get
 a good night's--
Fucking hang up

1267
01:05:12,234 --> 01:05:13,901
-the fucking phone!
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1268
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:16,634
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
 No F-bombs, dude.

1269
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:18,601
 You know that.
 I gotta let you go.

1270
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,300
Uh--

1271
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:21,334
Hello!

1272
01:05:22,634 --> 01:05:24,167
Why are you
doing this to me?

1273
01:05:24,234 --> 01:05:26,400
I'm not doing nothing to you!
You do it all to yourself!

1274
01:05:26,467 --> 01:05:27,701
I'm sick of you
treating me like a baby!

1275
01:05:27,767 --> 01:05:29,534
You area baby,
with your calls

1276
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:31,000
and your little
playmate Sal!

1277
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:33,334
Why don't you grow up
and get a life?
I have a life!

1278
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,334
No, you don't!
I'm happy
with my life!

1279
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,300
No, you're not!
Hey, I think I would know!

1280
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:39,267
Happy is family,
children!

1281
01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:41,234
Oh, says you!
Says everybody!

1282
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,067
There's basic stuff
every person needs!
Oh, don't--

1283
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:46,267
Your brother has 'em,
your sister has 'em,
only you!

1284
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:48,834
Hey! Hey! No! No!
I don't want
what they've got!

1285
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:52,000
I don't want it!
I don't want it!
I don't want it!

1290
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,334
 This Giants fan
 is really upset.

1291
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,501
 He's afraid they're gonna
 lose out the string now,

1292
01:06:34,567 --> 01:06:38,033
 so now he's watching
 the Jets and the 49ers

1293
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:41,000
 and hoping they could,
 uh, wring out a win.

1294
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:44,033
 This is a depressed
 Giants fan today, folks.

1296
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,834
 That was his best year.

1297
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:51,067
 It wasn't,
 you know, 15-16.

1298
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:53,000
 Uh, this kid Harvey had,
 Derrick Harvey,

1299
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:54,400
 has four sacks through
 the first eight games--

1301
01:06:59,334 --> 01:07:00,567
Where you going?

1302
01:07:03,934 --> 01:07:05,133
Paul?

1305
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:17,100
 I have no idea
 where you are.

1306
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:20,300
 When you take my car,
 you can at least
 have the courtesy to--

1308
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:24,534
 Message deleted.
 Next message.

1309
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,200
 Yo, Paul, where are you?
 I've been calling.

1310
01:08:26,267 --> 01:08:27,567
 We watching at your place?

1313
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,567
 ...at KYW 1060.com.

1314
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:07,067
 Philadelphia officials admit
 they won't even come close

1315
01:10:07,133 --> 01:10:08,400
 to meeting their goal

1316
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:10,934
 with installing
 250 surveillance cameras

1317
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,834
 in high crime areas
 by the end of--

1318
01:10:12,901 --> 01:10:15,100
 The governor, governor of the
 Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,

1319
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:17,734
 Governor Ed Rendell, back
 with us on the big talker 1210.

1320
01:10:17,801 --> 01:10:19,868
 Governor, we got
 a cheesesteak here
 with your name on it.

1321
01:10:19,934 --> 01:10:21,567
 Yeah. I'm on the air?

1322
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:24,834
 Well, I eat, uh, pizza
 around this time of night.

1323
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:26,634
 I'm on my way back
 to Harrisburg.

1324
01:10:26,701 --> 01:10:27,968
 I'm in the car, and--

1327
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,701
 * What's gotta be will be *

1330
01:11:22,634 --> 01:11:25,267
 * Gonna have
 your sweet lovin' *

1331
01:11:25,334 --> 01:11:27,834
 * Daddy

1332
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:52,601
 * Gonna have
 your sweet lovin' *

1333
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:55,267
 * Daddy
 rollin' in your arms *

1334
01:12:02,334 --> 01:12:04,868
 * Gonna fly me to your door *

1336
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,400
 McNabb already looking sharp,
 coming off a great game

1337
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:24,901
 last week against St. Louis.

1338
01:12:29,234 --> 01:12:30,267
Phil!

1341
01:12:46,534 --> 01:12:47,467
Phil!

1342
01:12:58,701 --> 01:12:59,634
Phil!

1343
01:13:07,868 --> 01:13:10,334
We get to Wisconsin,
and literally I came

1344
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,167
as we're driving across
the bridge into Wisconsin.
It was like a conquest.

1345
01:13:13,234 --> 01:13:15,267
Right.
We get to Wisconsin,
he says,

1346
01:13:15,334 --> 01:13:17,334
"Hey, can you drive a stick?"
And I was like, "Huh?"

1347
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,434
 I'm like,
"Dude, I can drive
a stick."

1348
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,067
And he fucked her
in the back?

1349
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:23,701
He fucked her
in the back seat,
but first,

1350
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,934
the lady goes,
"Fricking huge!"

1351
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,400
That was
frickin' huge.

1352
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:31,133
That was big.
That was big for us.

1353
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:35,467
Let's go on.
Bring it fuckin' home.

1354
01:13:35,534 --> 01:13:36,901
Let's go,
let's go,
let's go.

1355
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:42,634
This is what you call
a game turner.

1356
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,601
It's called
a game "changer,"
you motherfucker.

1357
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:47,701
Phil!

1360
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,801
Starving.

1361
01:13:55,601 --> 01:13:57,667
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
What you gonna do?
Come on!

1363
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,000
Throw it
up his ass!
Phil!

1364
01:14:00,067 --> 01:14:01,000
Let's go!

1367
01:14:07,434 --> 01:14:09,834
Yeah, you fuckin' asshole!

1368
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:11,267
Yes! Oh, yes!

1369
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:13,534
That's what
I'm talking about!
Yes.

1370
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:15,534
That's what
I'm talking about!

1372
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:19,734
Whoo!
We got this.

1373
01:14:19,801 --> 01:14:21,334
We got this.
We got this.

1375
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:24,000
Take away that bullshit
fumble call,

1376
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:25,434
we'd be up 14.

1377
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:27,701
Yeah, you know what?
Not to worry.
It's about to get ugly.

1378
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:29,167
Yeah, it's gonna
get fuckin' ugly.

1379
01:14:29,234 --> 01:14:30,234
Yeah.

1380
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,901
How's it going, bo?
Phil.

1381
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:32,901
Oh. Mark.

1382
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,667
How's it going?
Good, good.

1383
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:36,601
I like the paint.
You got your colors,
right?

1384
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,367
I'm flyin'
mycolors, man.

1385
01:14:38,434 --> 01:14:40,434
-He's got his
fucking colors on.
-Fly them, man. Fly 'em.

1386
01:14:40,501 --> 01:14:44,200
Fuckin' queers.
Douche, douche.

1387
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:45,200
Douche bags.

1389
01:14:46,267 --> 01:14:47,367
Douche, douche!

1391
01:14:49,467 --> 01:14:51,934
Douche, douche.

1392
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,067
Now-- Now I just
want it to become,
like, an annihilation.

1393
01:14:56,133 --> 01:14:58,434
Like, I just want it
to become an abomination,

1394
01:14:58,501 --> 01:15:00,534
an annihilation,
a murder,

1395
01:15:00,601 --> 01:15:02,234
a mass fuckin' murder!

1396
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:04,367
You fuck.

1397
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:08,601
I want to
mass fuckin' murder,
these motherfuckers.

1398
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,067
You know what I mean?

1400
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,334
An abomination!

1401
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,667
Whoo!

1404
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:20,434
Yeah.
Yeah.

1405
01:15:20,501 --> 01:15:21,934
Yeah!

1406
01:15:22,033 --> 01:15:22,968
Yeah.

1409
01:15:31,634 --> 01:15:33,434
 In the end zone!
 Touchdown!

1411
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:40,968
Yes! Fucking touchdown,
you asshole! Yes!

1412
01:15:41,033 --> 01:15:43,033
Yes! You fuck!

1413
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,868
That's what
I'm fuckin' talking about!

1414
01:15:44,934 --> 01:15:47,200
Ah, ha! Ha ha ha!

1415
01:15:47,267 --> 01:15:50,167
Asshole!
Look at him. Yeah,
he's a giant fag!

1416
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:53,400
No, no,
not a giant fag.
He's a Giantfag,

1417
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:57,067
like a Giant fag?
You know what I mean?
You dumb fuck. Yes!

1418
01:15:57,133 --> 01:16:01,000
Yes! I love it. Whoo!

1419
01:16:02,367 --> 01:16:04,634
Hey, I-- Listen, this is

1420
01:16:04,701 --> 01:16:07,601
but, uh,
do I know you?

1421
01:16:09,267 --> 01:16:14,267
Just that you sound familiar,
you know, your voice. Um...

1423
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:17,334
You ever go, uh,
listen to, uh,

1424
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,734
The Pen? 860?

1425
01:16:19,801 --> 01:16:20,868
Sometimes.

1426
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:23,501
 Rob Ryan
or Eagle's Nest

1427
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:24,767
or Nothing But Netsky--

1428
01:16:24,834 --> 01:16:26,133
you know,
those call-in shows?

1429
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,367
I'm pretty much a regular
on all those shows.

1430
01:16:28,434 --> 01:16:29,367
That's gotta be it.

1431
01:16:29,434 --> 01:16:30,734
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah. He, um...

1445
01:16:54,334 --> 01:16:56,200
He's a big fan. Bishop
was his favorite player.
Right.

1446
01:16:56,267 --> 01:16:57,634
And somehow or another,
he pissed him off.

1447
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:59,300
It's, like, you wanna

1448
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:02,300
You wanna belike Mike,

1488
01:18:28,868 --> 01:18:32,100
 The clock has expired,
 the season has expired.

1490
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:48,667
Are you gonna--

1491
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:51,667
Are you gonna

1492
01:18:51,734 --> 01:18:53,834
Yeah. Shit, yeah.

1493
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:55,367
I got a big bag of salt

1494
01:18:55,434 --> 01:18:57,567

for rubbing into.

1496
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:02,467

I bet that loser's

1497
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:04,634
writing out
his suicide note
as we speak.

1498
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:05,634
Yeah.

1499
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:07,667
Uhh...sss...

1500
01:19:07,734 --> 01:19:08,667
Ahh.

1501
01:19:09,901 --> 01:19:12,934
Come on! Gotta drain
the monster. Let's go.

1504
01:19:30,267 --> 01:19:32,701
Bo, what are you doing?
I'm taking a fuckin'--

1505
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,133
Hey, whoa, whoa.
What are you-- What
are you doing, man?

1506
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,501
Don't do-- Don't do that.
Be quiet.

1507
01:19:38,634 --> 01:19:39,767
No, no, no,
don't-- don't--

1508
01:19:39,834 --> 01:19:41,033
Quiet. Okay?

1509
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:46,300
You didn't have to be mean.

1510
01:19:48,267 --> 01:19:49,868
What are you talking about,
mean?

1511
01:19:51,634 --> 01:19:53,000
Every--

1512
01:19:53,067 --> 01:19:55,234
Everybody's
always so mean.

1513
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:58,601
Bo, I don't know
who the fuck you are, okay?

1514
01:19:58,667 --> 01:19:59,601
What are you doing?

1515
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:02,400
And it wears me out.

1516
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,534
Yo, listen to me.
Listen to me.

1517
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,567
You got the wrong guy here,
you understand?
 No.

1518
01:20:09,133 --> 01:20:10,968
I got...the right guy.

1519
01:20:12,534 --> 01:20:13,634
No, no, don't--
don't do that.

1520
01:20:13,701 --> 01:20:14,934
Don't do that. I-- Don't

1521
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,133
do-- Unnh!

1526
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:26,634
Uhh...

1527
01:20:27,868 --> 01:20:28,901
Uhh! Uhh!

1528
01:20:28,968 --> 01:20:30,100
Ohh!

1529
01:20:31,167 --> 01:20:33,567
Uhh! Ohh!

1530
01:20:33,634 --> 01:20:35,701
Ohh!

1532
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:40,601
My God.

1533
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:41,734
What's--

1534
01:20:41,801 --> 01:20:43,634
What the fuck?

1537
01:21:03,634 --> 01:21:05,300
Eagles...

1538
01:21:05,367 --> 01:21:06,534
suck.

1539
01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:11,133
 * Delta Dawn *

1540
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,133
 * What's that flower
 you have on? * 

1541
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,901
 * Could it be a faded rose? *

1543
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:19,534
Get back!

1544
01:21:20,601 --> 01:21:23,567
 * And did I hear you say *

1545
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:26,133
 * He was a-meetin'
 you here today *

1547
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,634
 * To take you
 to his mansion *

1548
01:21:29,701 --> 01:21:32,567
 * In the sky? *

1549
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:34,434
 * She's 41 *

1550
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:37,601
 * And her daddy
 still calls her baby *

1551
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,834
 * All the folks *
Freeze!

1552
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:45,100
 * Around Brownsville
 say she's crazy *

1553
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:47,968
 * 'Cause she walks downtown
 with a suitcase *

1554
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:50,200
 * In her hand *

1555
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:55,667
 * Lookin' for a mysterious
 dark-haired man *

1558
01:21:58,567 --> 01:22:00,100
 * Delta Dawn *

1559
01:22:00,167 --> 01:22:03,434
 * What's that flower
 you have on? *
Sorry!

1560
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,834
 * Could it be a faded rose *
Sorry!

1561
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:07,234
 * From days gone by? *

1562
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,467
Ow, ow, ow.
Shut the fuck up!

1563
01:22:09,534 --> 01:22:12,067
 * And did I hear you say *

1564
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:15,868
 * He was a-meetin'
 you here today *

1565
01:22:15,934 --> 01:22:18,334
 * To take you
 to his mansion *

1566
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,868
 * In the sky? *

1567
01:22:21,934 --> 01:22:24,234
 * Delta Dawn *

1568
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:27,067
 * What's that flower
 in the sky? *

1571
01:22:47,133 --> 01:22:48,834
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1572
01:22:48,901 --> 01:22:51,067
I don't know
what I--
I know.

1573
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,200
What are
you gonna do?
What are you

1574
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:53,868
gonna do?
What are you
gonna do?

1577
01:23:12,334 --> 01:23:13,534
Hey!

1578
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:15,601
Hey.

1579
01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:19,367
How's it going?

1580
01:23:22,767 --> 01:23:25,434
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

1581
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:28,601
So, um, yeah.

1582
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:30,267
Your mom been by?

1583
01:23:30,334 --> 01:23:32,934
Uh, she came by
a few days ago.

1584
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,934
Um...

1585
01:23:35,601 --> 01:23:37,534
She's not really
taking this too well.

1586
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:39,267
Yeah?
Yeah.

1588
01:23:43,534 --> 01:23:47,000
How about, uh, Jeff?

1589
01:23:47,067 --> 01:23:49,634
Jeff was supposed
to come by yesterday,

1590
01:23:49,701 --> 01:23:53,501
and then something
with his kid
or something...

1593
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,033
Oh, oh! Hey, hey, hey.

1594
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,501
Hey...

1595
01:24:07,567 --> 01:24:08,634
What?

1596
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,434
It's out?

1597
01:24:18,501 --> 01:24:21,067
Hot off the press,
from today's Post.

1598
01:24:21,133 --> 01:24:22,567
Oh, my God.

1600
01:24:28,734 --> 01:24:29,968
This is cake!

1601
01:24:30,033 --> 01:24:31,267
Uh, that's what I said.

1602
01:24:31,334 --> 01:24:33,033
Francisco...

1603
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,601
Miami...

1604
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:38,734
13 and 3. Easy.

1605
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:39,968
What are your
three losses?

1606
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,834
Green Bay, New England,
Chargers.

1607
01:24:42,901 --> 01:24:44,734
We could easily
beat Green Bay.

1608
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:45,901
14 and 2.

1609
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:50,734
Oh. Oh, man.

1610
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:51,901
What?

1611
01:24:53,434 --> 01:24:56,033
New England, December 20th.

1612
01:24:58,934 --> 01:25:00,601
I get out that week.

1613
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:01,667
Oh, shit.

1614
01:25:01,734 --> 01:25:02,667
Patsies are toast.

1615
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:03,767
There's no way we're losing

1616
01:25:03,834 --> 01:25:05,601
with us in the parking lot.
Not a chance.

1617
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:07,868
15 and 1.

1618
01:25:07,934 --> 01:25:09,067
Totally realistic.

1619
01:25:10,601 --> 01:25:12,000
Oh, man.

1620
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:15,467
Oh, man!

1621
01:25:20,434 --> 01:25:21,901
It's gonna be a great year.

1622
01:25:23,367 --> 01:25:26,734
 * I got kicked
 off of Noah's Ark *

1623
01:25:26,801 --> 01:25:29,834
 * I turned my cheek
 to unkind remarks *

1624
01:25:29,901 --> 01:25:32,234
 * There was two
 of everything *

1625
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,634
 * And one of me *

1626
01:25:35,701 --> 01:25:38,133
 * And when the rains
 came tumblin' down *

1627
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,400
 * Held my breath,
 and I stood my ground *

1628
01:25:41,467 --> 01:25:42,901
 * And I watched that ship *

1629
01:25:42,968 --> 01:25:46,934
 * Go sailin' out to sea *

1630
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,334
 * Take it back *

1631
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,033
 * Take it back *

1632
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,601
 * Oh, no,
 you can't say that *

1633
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:54,167
 * All of my friends *

1634
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:55,634
 * Are not dead *

1635
01:25:55,701 --> 01:25:59,000
 * Or in jail *

1636
01:25:59,067 --> 01:26:01,801
 * Through rock
 and through stone *

1637
01:26:01,868 --> 01:26:04,200
 * The black wind still moans *

1638
01:26:04,267 --> 01:26:05,834
 * Sweet revenge *

1639
01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:07,334
 * Sweet revenge *

1640
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,534
 * Without fail *

1641
01:26:10,601 --> 01:26:13,367
 * I caught an aisle seat
 on a plane *

1642
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:16,067
 * And drove
 an English teacher
 half insane *

1643
01:26:16,133 --> 01:26:18,901
 * Makin' up jokes
 about bicycle spokes *

1644
01:26:18,968 --> 01:26:22,067
 * And red balloons *

1645
01:26:22,133 --> 01:26:24,868
 * So I called
 on my local deejay *

1646
01:26:24,934 --> 01:26:27,901
 * And he didn't have
 a lot to say *

1647
01:26:27,968 --> 01:26:29,334
 * But the radio *

1648
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,467
 * Has learned
 all my favorite tunes *

1649
01:26:33,534 --> 01:26:34,901
 * Take it back *

1650
01:26:34,968 --> 01:26:36,501
 * Take it back *

1651
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:39,267
 * Oh, no, you
 can't say that *

1652
01:26:39,334 --> 01:26:40,701
 * All of my friends *

1653
01:26:40,767 --> 01:26:42,167
 * Are not dead *

1654
01:26:42,234 --> 01:26:45,434
 * Or in jail *

1655
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:48,167
 * Through rock
 and through stone *

1656
01:26:48,234 --> 01:26:50,701
 * The black wind still moans *

1657
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:52,234
 * Sweet revenge *

1658
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,667
 * Sweet revenge *

1659
01:26:53,734 --> 01:26:57,133
 * Without fail *

1660
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,701
 * The white meat
 is on the run *

1661
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:02,801
 * And the dark meat
 is far too done *

1662
01:27:02,868 --> 01:27:05,334
 * And the milkman
 left me a note *

1663
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,868
 * Yesterday *

1664
01:27:06,934 --> 01:27:08,834
 * Yesterday *

1665
01:27:08,901 --> 01:27:10,901
 * Get outta this town
 by noon *

1666
01:27:10,968 --> 01:27:11,901
 * Get out! *

1667
01:27:11,968 --> 01:27:12,901
 * You're comin' on *

1668
01:27:12,968 --> 01:27:13,901
 * Way too soon *

1669
01:27:13,968 --> 01:27:14,901
 * Right now *

1670
01:27:14,968 --> 01:27:15,901
 * And besides that *

1671
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,100
 * We never liked you *

1672
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:19,834
 * Anyway *

1673
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,367
 * Take it back *

1674
01:27:21,434 --> 01:27:22,934
 * Take it back *

1675
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,834
 * Oh, no, you
 can't say that *

1676
01:27:25,901 --> 01:27:27,234
 * All of my friends *

1677
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,601
 * Are not dead *

1678
01:27:28,667 --> 01:27:31,901
 * Or in jail *

1679
01:27:31,968 --> 01:27:34,667
 * Through rock
 and through stone *

1680
01:27:34,734 --> 01:27:37,200
 * The black wind still moans *

1681

 * Sweet revenge *

1682
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,067
 * Sweet revenge *

1683
