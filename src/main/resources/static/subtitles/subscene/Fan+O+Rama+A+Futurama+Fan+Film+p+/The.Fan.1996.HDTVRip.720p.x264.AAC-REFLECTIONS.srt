1
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,460
Excited and anxious
I await my dream

2
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,300
To escape, applaud
And embrace my team

3
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,100
Opening day I always can trust

4
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,820
It's just for this high
That I crazily lust

5
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,100
Return of our hero
Does brighten the days

6
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,540
Just briefly, my troubles
Get lost in the haze

7
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,900
The grace from the field
Arouses the crowd

8
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,340
Reflects on the days
When I was quite proud

9
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,420
I'm more entranced
Than the average fan

10
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,260
I used to play, you see
And I know I still can

11
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,220
That time I drove the ball
With such loft

12
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,940
My exit atop shoulders
As they carried me off

13
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,500
This pastime and I
Just fade into one

14
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,300
Expanded upon
From father and son

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,020
My boy is young
And awkward for now

16
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,540
I just need the time
And can show him how

17
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,780
I really am quite close
Just a break away

18
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,340
From straightening things out
And being okay

19
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,660
I can help my team
To regain its glory

20
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,901
With just a little twist
To the same old story

21
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:48,741
Players say now
They play for themselves

22
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:51,981
This causes a burning
Within me that dwells

23
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,341
The fan is the one
Who pays for the game

24
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:59,461
Which bestows all the riches
And welcomed fame

25
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,821
The players will listen
But really don't hear

26
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,941
All the while just hiding
Behind an invisible tear

27
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,301
I grow tired now of all this greed

28
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:14,141
And chart a course to set things free

29
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:57,581
We got our first caller.
Is that Gil on the cellular?

30
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,501
Yes, sir, it sure is.

31
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:03,621
- What's that I hear in the background?
- That's my Giants watch.

32
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:06,221
- I'm late for work.
- Giants watch, great.

33
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:09,781
- What do you got for us, Gil?
- It's just I'm really psyched.

34
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:12,261
Opening day's tomorrow.
We're all psyched.

35
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,621
This is different. I've been waiting
a long time for this one.

36
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:18,581
- What are you waiting for?
- Bobby Rayburn. We got him.

37
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:22,341
- We're going all the way this year.
- What would you bet on that?

38
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:26,941
- I'd bet everything I own, that's for sure.
- I like this guy. You think Rayburn's...

39
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:30,301
...worth the 40 mil, huh?
-.310 lifetime batting average.

40
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,581
He's worth twice that,
three times that.

41
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,021
I bet he'd love to hear you say that.
Let's see if we can get him on the line.

42
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:40,661
- You're gonna get him on the line?
- "Yes. Hang on. Let's find Bobby."

43
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:43,821
When we come back, we will be
talking to Bobby Rayburn.

44
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:45,342
Great.

45
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,942
You got Bobby Rayburn
on the line yet?

46
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:59,462
Who the fuck does this
guy think he is?

47
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:03,102
- Three- time National League MVP?
- That allows him to fuck up my show?

48
00:05:03,462 --> 00:05:05,782
- "Hello, I got Rayburn on the line."
- We got him!

49
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:07,702
And go.

50
00:05:07,902 --> 00:05:11,422
Welcome back, we're here with the
hopes and dreams of all Giants fans.

51
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:14,622
Ex-Brave centre fielder
and league RBI champ...

52
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:18,622
... four of the last five years,
Local boy come home, Bobby Rayburn.

53
00:05:18,942 --> 00:05:21,782
- How you doing, Bobby?
- Hey, Jewel, how you doing?

54
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:25,262
Good to be talking to you.
I want to tell you, I love your show.

55
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,822
- Thanks a lot.
- Bobby, this is Bernie...

56
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:30,702
A lot of fans are on the line
dying to talk to you.

57
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:33,902
But first, how does it feel
to be back in the Bay Area?

58
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:38,182
I'm telling you, it's great. I grew up
here. The Giants are my homies.

59
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:40,902
That's good to hear.
But let me ask you this:

60
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:43,862
You're famous for your
dedication to perfection.

61
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:46,462
You're one of the
hardest-working players.

62
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:48,062
Don't forget "good-looking."

63
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,982
But come on, now. Bobby, baby...

64
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:53,462
...do you honestly think you are worth
40 million simoleons?

65
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:56,142
He's one of the best ballplayers
in the league.

66
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,342
I'm glad you asked me. I don't like to
put a money value on a human being.

67
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:04,462
But I think I have given 100 percent
to every franchise I've played with.

68
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,222
Attaway, Bobby!

69
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,022
Thank you for not answering.

70
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,902
- Better retreat.
- She's a riot.

71
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:15,302
What about the fans? Won't all
this money raise their expectations?

72
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:20,302
I hope so. I consider myself a
baseball fan first and a player second.

73
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:23,382
And in the game of baseball,
it's all about the fans.

74
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:27,022
- You tell them, Bob.
- And the Juan Primo controversy?

75
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:29,142
Giants centre fielder since 1990.

76
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,302
You come in, bump him to the left.
Some people resent that.

77
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:35,062
- Bitch!
- I don't think Primo's one of them.

78
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:36,902
You know, he's a team player.

79
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:40,142
That makes him great.
I look forward to playing with him.

80
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:43,302
That's great, Bobby.
Let's get back to our callers. Gil?

81
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:46,862
- Yeah, am...? Am I on the air?
- Yes, you are, Gil.

82
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:50,022
Jewel, why do you
have to be so negative?

83
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:54,343
Come on, I'm a sweetheart.

84
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:57,303
The guy's making a lot of money.
Would you turn it down?

85
00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:59,143
You'd be nuts to turn them down.

86
00:06:59,343 --> 00:07:01,543
Why be down on Rayburn
because he's not nuts?

87
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,263
You got a point. I apologize.

88
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,063
- "Hey, Bobby, are you listening to me?"
- I sure am!

89
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,423
- Thanks for backing me up, man.
- No problem. It's a pleasure.

90
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,623
Just remember
where you heard it first.

91
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:14,583
I played the game.
I know what I'm talking about.

92
00:07:14,863 --> 00:07:16,223
Grew up on the Giants.

93
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:19,183
My dad moved the family here
when the Giants moved here.

94
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:22,063
I watched you ever since
you hit the grand slam...

95
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:24,863
...against South Bay
in the '82 city championship.

96
00:07:25,983 --> 00:07:29,743
That's when I saw you were somebody
special, and you never let me down.

97
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:32,983
When the two of you come together,
Rayburn and the Giants...

98
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:36,823
...that's like a magical conjunction,
like the alignment of the planets.

99
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,903
You're gonna bring us all the way.
Who said it first?

100
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:41,423
You did, Gil! You did!

101
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:44,303
- Attaway, Bobby!
- We hope so.

102
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,303
- Bobby, let's talk about your divorce.
- Christ, look.

103
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,223
I just got to the ballpark.
I'm really sorry, but I gotta go.

104
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:55,263
- Really enjoyed talking to you.
- Anytime, Bobby. Good luckout there.

105
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:56,863
We will be right back.

106
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,463
- I am so surprised he hung up.
- Thank you.

107
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:11,063
Giants haven't had a one- two punch
like this since Mays and McCovey.

108
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,983
Joining the list of bullshit excuses...

109
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:17,103
...we've had a lot of whining...

110
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:20,943
...about product quality from certain
members of our sales force.

111
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:24,023
Example: The two Jima line.

112
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,423
Gil, do you see
any quality problems there?

113
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:32,943
Blade's too thin, pommel's too light,
and there's a half tang hidden in there.

114
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:35,543
Maybe that's why you're not selling.

115
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:39,263
Sweet.

116
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:43,383
Somebody made a mistake, man.
I wear number 11.

117
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:47,303
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- It's cool. Manny, just handle it.

118
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,623
Me? I think this knife's an asskicker.

119
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,704
This door, on the other hand,
comes off a foreign car.

120
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:03,704
Well, need I say more?

121
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:08,424
- Why are you guys still here?
- There's been a glitch, okay?

122
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:10,544
- I'm working on it.
- What's a "glitch"?

123
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:14,184
A detail that hasn't been worked out.
Permutation that happens in...

124
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,104
What? With my number?

125
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,504
- Yeah, with your number.
- No, no, no.

126
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:20,504
Manny, you know I wear number 11.

127
00:09:20,784 --> 00:09:23,104
- Of course.
- So there shouldn't be any problem.

128
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:25,784
It is a problem. Primo wears 11.

129
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:35,384
Tickets in yet?

130
00:09:35,664 --> 00:09:37,944
Tickets? What tickets?

131
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,944
- Opening day.
- You got other things to worry about.

132
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:45,824
I'll let you in on a little secret, Gil. You
came this close to kissing pavement.

133
00:09:46,104 --> 00:09:47,944
- How about that close?
- Yeah.

134
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:51,304
Management had you on the list.
I talked them out of it.

135
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:53,224
Don't make me regret it.

136
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,464
- Thanks, master.
- Okay, fuck it.

137
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,144
I'm not playing with number 33.
You understand?

138
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,664
I know. Just be cool.
Let me take care of it.

139
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:04,624
Three times 11 is 33.
You may play three- times better.

140
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,744
Thanks. I'll talk to you in a minute.

141
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:09,784
Jesus was 33 when he died.
People still talk about him.

142
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,304
- Give me my number.
- Think about it, seriously.

143
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:14,104
Should I fire him?

144
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:17,584
I should fire him, huh?
I should fire his butt.

145
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:21,224
Good form.

146
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,904
Seriously. I promised those tickets
to my clients.

147
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:26,304
Don't make me look
like an asshole. Please.

148
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:29,184
- I do have a reputation to uphold.
- A reputa...

149
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,944
Jesus-fucking"..."

150
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:36,464
Nobody cares. You're stuck in a
time warp with your head up your ass.

151
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:41,464
- Why, because I don't wanna sell crap?
- We are not dedicated to perfection!

152
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:44,424
People don't want quality.
They want cheap product.

153
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:48,744
When that fucks up, they want to
replace it, so that's what we give them.

154
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:58,824
You got till the end of the month, Gil.

155
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:01,704
Look...

156
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:05,625
...McKinley and Everest is our
biggest account. You better close on it.

157
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:09,345
Bring in the fucking numbers.

158
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:12,705
Asshole.

159
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:19,505
Sid, what was the missing link
on your ball club last season?

160
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:23,945
We'd have made the playoffs if Rayburn
hadn't hit that three- run shot in Atlanta.

161
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:27,785
Everybody said, "Why don't we
have a slugger like that?" Now we do.

162
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:31,145
- Bobby, a picture?
- Why don't we take one with Primo.

163
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:33,705
- Sounds good.
- Keep smiling.

164
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:35,625
Keep fucking smiling.

165
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:40,745
- I hope you like it in centre field.
- Yeah, I hope you like it in left.

166
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,145
No more questions.

167
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:52,905
2.5 million signing bonus.
Half this year and half the next. Yeah.

168
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:57,065
Well, well, if it isn't Jewel, my favourite
token female sports reporter.

169
00:11:57,465 --> 00:12:00,425
- Blow me, Manny.
- I would, but you haven't had your shots.

170
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:03,385
There were also bonuses
based on winning the MVP...

171
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,705
I want an interview
with Rayburn, Manny.

172
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,145
Are we talking about "the
overpaid, overrated SOB...

173
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,225
...with the pending divorce Rayburn?

174
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,985
- I call them as I see them.
- Well, you've been crossed off the list.

175
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:18,105
- I knew you'd understand.
- Deferred payments starting 2007.

176
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:23,625
Cut the crap. Are you saying there's
no way to get your boy to talk to me?

177
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:26,425
Is that what you're saying?
He's gotta talk to me.

178
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:30,265
I'm saying he'd rather nail his penis
to a burning building.

179
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:34,265
- I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to her.

180
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:36,185
Checkout this puppy.

181
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:38,305
The walk and the talk.

182
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:41,065
How's it walk? How's it talk?
This is the one.

183
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,745
Are you happy with your
current supplier?

184
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:49,425
Any more of these demonstrations,
I'll have to start shaving my legs.

185
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:51,545
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

186
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:55,465
The big motherfucker, the little
motherfucker. Which do you want?

187
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:59,705
Any more demos, I'll have to start
shaving the hairs on my ass.

188
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:03,825
As you can see, the performance
on this baby is really something.

189
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:13,866
"Knife doing business.

190
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:16,466
Come on, bring it, baby. Bring it.

191
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:27,306
- Jesus Christ.
- Poetry in motion, baby.

192
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:38,146
- Two behind home plate?
- I'm your man.

193
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,666
Two hundred dollars each.

194
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,786
- Two hundred apiece?
- Two hundred.

195
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:46,786
- That's a lot. How about 125?
- Fuck 125. This is opening day here.

196
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:50,706
- Two hundred, goddamn it. Jesus.
- Okay, okay, okay.

197
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:54,746
Now you want the tickets, huh?

198
00:13:56,266 --> 00:14:00,026
Anytime I can do you more fucking
favours, you just let me know, all right?

199
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:03,546
You in a coma or what, buddy?
Get the fuckout of here.

200
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:06,906
- Know what bugs me about you guys?
- Like I care.

201
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:08,946
You don't even care about the game.

202
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:13,906
You ebony god, you prince of darkness,
you Othellian Moor, you black man!

203
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:17,466
You look good out there! You look
good. I bet we hit.400 this year.

204
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:21,306
- Come on, don't jinx me.
- I'm sorry, man. I get emotional, crazy.

205
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,386
All right, so tell me, what we got?

206
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,506
Spalding wants you to sign their balls.
We got that Wish Upon a Star routine:

207
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,826
Sick kid wants to shake hands with
great ballplayer. You'll have to do.

208
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:37,306
What do you think? Maybe I should
bring a ball for the sick kid.

209
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,186
No, I think a bat would be much nicer.

210
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:43,066
All right, here. Give him a bat.

211
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:45,386
You know it's not a good time for this.

212
00:14:46,826 --> 00:14:50,466
- What's the gentleman's name again?
- His name's Stanley. Stanley Jackson.

213
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,546
Thank you, Michelle.

214
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:03,866
Stanley, Gil Renard.
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

215
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:06,106
- How do you do?
- How you doing?

216
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:08,026
Here's my card.

217
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:13,386
Are you happy
with your current supplier?

218
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,067
- I sure am.
- Well, then let me just...

219
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:20,747
If you could give me three minutes
of your time, I will prove to you...

220
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:22,387
- Can I demonstrate?
- Sure.

221
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:24,307
If I can just prove to you...

222
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:29,507
...we're superior in quality because
of our fit, hand-sharpening, polishing...

223
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:33,147
...and strength.

224
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:36,667
These features, combined with our
low prices, our superior terms...

225
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:39,947
...make us one of the most
sought-after competitors around.

226
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,307
- That's why I'd...
- We signed an exclusive with Gerber.

227
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:45,307
They got the whole chain sewed up.

228
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,587
We can't pass wind in a tent
without going through them.

229
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,307
Sorry to hear that.

230
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:55,187
- Do you have the Little Pecker?
- Yes, I do.

231
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:59,987
- You really are on the cutting edge.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,387
I'm sorry we can't do business.

233
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,667
Well, you're sure I can't
interest you in this?

234
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,267
You got any kayaks?

235
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,387
You gotta be
out of your mind. Kayaks?

236
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,947
I could use kayaks.

237
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,387
Stanley, what the fuck do kayaks
have to do with knives?

238
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,187
Never mind.

239
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:26,747
You fucking asshole. Kayaks?
When I'm asking you about knives?

240
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:29,427
Yeah. I understand, sir.
Thank you for coming in.

241
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:33,547
How about you get some kayaks and
stick them up your fucking ass, moron.

242
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,587
Your stopwatch.

243
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:45,267
Hey, thanks a lot for coming.
Nice to meet you.

244
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,227
Look. We got the same hairdo.

245
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,587
You sick too?

246
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:54,747
Hey, slugger, come on,
shake his hand.

247
00:16:55,987 --> 00:17:00,027
How you doing, man? You hanging
in there? What's your name?

248
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,227
Sean.

249
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,227
Sean?

250
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,547
Sean.

251
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:10,587
Wow, what a coincidence.
That's my son's name too.

252
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,707
Look, I have a present for you.

253
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,827
There you go.

254
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:18,907
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

255
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:21,908
Bobby Rayburn.

256
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,628
Tomorrow...

257
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,508
...hit a home run for me.

258
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:36,388
- Please?
- I'll try.

259
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,988
They said "sick," not "dying in front
of our eyes." How'd I know?

260
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:45,308
As if I don't have enough to worry
about. I get a poor kid on his deathbed.

261
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:47,228
- Oh, please.
- The kid was dying!

262
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:50,548
He has my son's name.
I mean, what kind of shit is that?

263
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:57,468
Lucky tie, lucky guy.

264
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,468
McKinley- Everest.

265
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:06,588
Okay, thank you.

266
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:09,268
Hi.

267
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:13,788
- Angie, you're looking as lovely as ever.
- He's gone.

268
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:17,908
- We had an appointment at 4.
- Yeah, it's 4: 11.

269
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,748
My watch is slow, I guess.
When will he be back?

270
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:24,988
He's gone for the day. But you
can see him tomorrow at 2:30.

271
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:28,748
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow"..."

272
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,708
Let's s"ee."

273
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,548
See if there's anything...

274
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:45,428
I would prefer the morning.

275
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:47,548
But how about late in the day?

276
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,828
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,708
Tomorrow at 3, he's off
to Chicago for three weeks.

278
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,508
Well, that's a problem.

279
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,468
It's my son. I want to take him
to opening day.

280
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:01,908
You know, myself as a father,
I'm a real cutup.

281
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:03,948
I'm gonna get to the point.

282
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:06,908
I'm trying to be a hero to my son...

283
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:11,228
...so if he could make it any other time,
it would really, really help me.

284
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:13,508
Just an hour later...

285
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,268
...so I could fit the game in.

286
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:19,268
- Excuse me. McKinley- Everest.
- Any other time at all? Anything?

287
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,068
- Okay, thank you.
- It would be a big help to me.

288
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:23,588
Like, an hour later.

289
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,228
I'm afraid I really can't help you.
He's got such a crazy schedule.

290
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:29,749
Okey- dokey.

291
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:35,869
Drop your cock and grab your socks.
Big day today. You excited?

292
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:37,789
Yeah, I'm up.

293
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:41,229
Manny, Manny, talk to me, man.
Make me happy.

294
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:43,909
Wish I could.
I just talked to Primo's people.

295
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:46,509
- They want 500 grand.
- Five hundred? For what?

296
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,429
Exactly. Exactly.
That's 250 G's a digit.

297
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:52,949
Man, come on!
What is this boy smoking?

298
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:56,869
I tried to haggle them down.
The kid says it's his lucky number.

299
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:00,909
Shit. Ain't that much luck in the world.
He's lucky to be in the country.

300
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,389
I hear you. Look, it's your call.

301
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:06,189
You want me to go back,
or are you happy with 33?

302
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:08,749
- Man, it's just a number, right?
- That's right.

303
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:11,629
I'll pick you up.
While you do her, thinkof me.

304
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,229
- That's a real short thought.
- I love you too.

305
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,549
- No, you don't.
- I'll catch you later.

306
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,549
Yeah.

307
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:32,469
Hey, Gil.

308
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,949
Hey, Ted.

309
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:37,629
Lose your job?

310
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,909
- It's my day off. And it's "Tim."
- Tim. Sorry.

311
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:43,469
- You remember Mike and Linda?
- Hey, Gil.

312
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,509
- Hi, Gil.
- Hi.

313
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:49,429
- You're late. What a surprise.
- Traffic. You know, traffic?

314
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,829
How original.

315
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,229
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing?

316
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,909
- Good.
- Ready for the game?

317
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,669
- What time will he be home?
- Depends on the game. Right, slugger?

318
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,989
6:05. He's not home, I call the cops.

319
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:07,469
I'm against this.
I wanna make that real clear to you.

320
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:10,709
- He's my kid too.
- Yeah?

321
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:13,509
Give me kisses. I love you.

322
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:17,549
- Bye.
- For the record, so everybody knows...

323
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:20,109
...don't make him do things
he doesn't want to.

324
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:23,189
I don't. Do I make you do things
you don't want to do?

325
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,389
- No.
- Okay?

326
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:28,349
Six o'clock, Gil.

327
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:32,589
Hey, Ted.

328
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,230
See you.

329
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,790
I remember when Mick recorded this,
February '78.

330
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,110
What?

331
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,990
I remember when Mick recorded this
in '78. We had a wild party afterwards.

332
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,790
Jason Pelligrini's dad
says Mick Jagger's gay.

333
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,590
Yeah? Well, Jason Pelligrini's dad
takes it up the ass.

334
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,950
- Tryouts are next week.
- Tryouts are next week?

335
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,150
Your mother didn't tell me.

336
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:23,990
Jason Pelligrini said his dad's
gonna pick me if I'm still available.

337
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,350
You'll make it. Positive things
happen to positive thinkers.

338
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,870
Tell me, what do you gotta do? What
are the three whats you gotta be?

339
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,150
- I don't want to do this, Dad.
- At bat, come on.

340
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,110
- Keep the bat low.
- No, keep it high, high.

341
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,790
- When you move your feet?
- Step on the eggshell...

342
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,670
...and squash the bug.
- Attaboy. That's perfect.

343
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,630
That's what Coop used to say.
I told you about what Coop said, right?

344
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,750
- Your old catcher, right?
- One of the finest athletes I ever knew.

345
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,110
Where'd you get that glove?

346
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,430
Tim gave it to me.

347
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,430
Piece of shit.

348
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,950
Opening day at
Candlestick Park, 1996.

349
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,150
What's not to love
about opening day?

350
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,110
Fathers sneaking away from work,
and kids playing hooky from school.

351
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,270
For at least one day,
everybody is in first place.

352
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:40,631
Opening day is what baseball's about.
How exciting is it...

353
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:43,191
...for Giants fans
with Rayburn coming hom"e..."

354
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:45,911
... after leading the Braves
to a championship?

355
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:01,431
Did you see that?
See the way he moved his legs?

356
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:03,551
- Can I have a hot dog?
- A what?

357
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:05,351
Can I have a hot dog?

358
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,551
You're in my seat.

359
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:10,631
If it isn't the ubiquitous
queen of AM radio herself.

360
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,151
Good morning, my sweet angel,
darling, baby.

361
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:14,671
Oh, yeah, whatever.

362
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,231
Manny, come on, don't dick me around.
It's an important piece, okay?

363
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:22,151
There's somebody there behind
that killer smile. I promis"e..."

364
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:24,911
...I will not hurt your boy.
I want Bobby Rayburn.

365
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,031
Bernie, correct me if I'm wrong...

366
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:31,071
...but isn't she the ball-buster
who had the temerity to ask my client...

367
00:24:31,351 --> 00:24:33,351
...if he was honestly worth 40 million?

368
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:35,271
- Am I a ball-buster?
- Yeah.

369
00:24:35,471 --> 00:24:37,311
Thank you.

370
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,071
- Whose is this?
- It's mine. I spit in it.

371
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,551
I thought your mother
confiscated that.

372
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:49,471
She did.

373
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:32,431
Play ball!

374
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:42,431
Yeah, attaway!

375
00:25:53,072 --> 00:25:54,592
Strike.

376
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:58,512
What are you doing? You missed it.
Hawkins struck him out.

377
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:00,832
- Pay attention.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

378
00:26:01,992 --> 00:26:03,992
Blaze winds, and the pitch to Pryor...

379
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:06,392
...swung on and driven deep
towards the gap.

380
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:08,112
He crushed it!

381
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:12,632
- Watch, watch, watch.
- What?

382
00:26:13,512 --> 00:26:14,832
I got it!

383
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:17,512
I got it!

384
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:20,592
Primo and Rayburn giving chase.
They converge and"..."

385
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,712
Lookout!

386
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:29,792
Centre field makes the calls.

387
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:38,792
Fundamental of baseball,
centre field makes the calls.

388
00:26:39,112 --> 00:26:40,352
Pay attention.

389
00:26:41,872 --> 00:26:43,992
Well, a scary moment on day one.

390
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:48,112
I'll tell you, Rayburn's slow getting up.
And Primo's still slow getting up.

391
00:26:48,512 --> 00:26:51,072
There's $40 million out there
in centre field, Steve.

392
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,312
Hope the Giants have
collision coverage.

393
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:56,272
This will help relieve the pain.

394
00:26:57,792 --> 00:27:00,672
- Doc, is the rib bruised or fractured?
- Neither.

395
00:27:01,072 --> 00:27:04,312
Bobby, what are you doing?
We got 161 games to go out there.

396
00:27:04,592 --> 00:27:06,432
Could you excuse me for a minute?

397
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:09,392
Thank you. You just signed
a $40 million contract.

398
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,272
Hurt yourself, you'll be batting
.100 by month's end.

399
00:27:12,552 --> 00:27:14,872
The media'll turn on you
faster than the fans.

400
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,752
- Listen, you gotta come out.
- I can't.

401
00:27:18,112 --> 00:27:19,672
I gotta be Babe- fucking-Ruth.

402
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:22,152
It's William-fucking-Bendix.
Get it right.

403
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:30,872
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

404
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:35,952
I'm just gonna make some phone calls.
Okay? Just business calls. I'll be back.

405
00:27:36,432 --> 00:27:40,192
- Go?
- Just downstairs for a minute.

406
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:43,072
Mom said we have to be home by 6,
or she'll be upset.

407
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:44,712
Forget about your mother.

408
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,713
I got it!

409
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:15,193
The wind took it. The wind took it.
Kid was lucky.

410
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,033
Kid was lucky.

411
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,033
Wind took it.

412
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:22,753
- You stepped on me.
- Don't worry. We'll get one next time.

413
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:26,593
Okay, I gotta go, all right?
I'll be back.

414
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:31,993
- You don't have to pee or anything?
- No.

415
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:44,153
What happened?

416
00:28:44,353 --> 00:28:47,793
Lanz hit one to right. Bases loaded.
Come on, grand slam!

417
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:51,273
Don't get greedy, son.
What we need now is a sacrifice.

418
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:54,993
A winning team knows how to
manufacture runs. Coop taught me that.

419
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:58,433
Know why he said the most
beautiful play is a sacrifice fly?

420
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:02,073
- You sacrifice for the team?
- And doesn't bring down your average.

421
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,873
That's why baseball's
better than life. It's fair.

422
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:06,513
Tell me what happens.

423
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:09,193
Now batting, number 33...

424
00:29:09,473 --> 00:29:11,593
... Bobby Rayburn.

425
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:14,553
Come on, Bobby!

426
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:26,833
Attaway, Bobby!

427
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:48,113
Rayburn look a little stiff to you?

428
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:51,113
I can't believe they left him in
after that collision.

429
00:29:51,393 --> 00:29:54,633
Right. That's all we need,
our $40 million man on the DL.

430
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:04,914
He's playing hurt. That's a
man showing his mettle.

431
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:09,994
Putting the team first. Remember,
last year he hit.314 against lefties.

432
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:13,074
Yo, Bobby!

433
00:30:20,274 --> 00:30:23,314
- Time!
- Oh, fuck.

434
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:26,114
Come on, let's play some
fucking baseball!

435
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:53,994
All right, Bobby, let's go!

436
00:30:54,794 --> 00:30:56,034
Play!

437
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:05,314
All right, Bobby!

438
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:08,314
- Go for it, Bobby!
- Go, Bobby!

439
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:10,114
Bobby!

440
00:31:12,714 --> 00:31:14,074
Hey, buddy...

441
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:16,554
...you wanna sit down?
Trying to see here.

442
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,354
Go, Bobby!

443
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,914
Come on! Let's go with
the fucking game! Shit!

444
00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:45,594
Strike!

445
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:49,714
Are you out of your mind, ump?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

446
00:31:50,114 --> 00:31:52,234
- Hey, sit down.
- Take your hands off me.

447
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:53,954
- Stop pushing, man!
- Just ask.

448
00:31:54,234 --> 00:31:58,154
- Why the fuck you pushing? I'm asking.
- Both of you, down in front!

449
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:01,994
- Fuck you!
- Down in front! Now!

450
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:13,155
Let's play some fucking ball!
You all right?

451
00:32:16,115 --> 00:32:18,115
What's your fucking problem?

452
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:20,515
You old busybody!

453
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:24,075
I gotta go, okay? I'll be back.

454
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:26,195
Fuck you!

455
00:33:15,475 --> 00:33:16,995
Oh, fuck.

456
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:22,915
Get out of here.

457
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:28,115
So could you just send me
over the stats? Yes.

458
00:33:28,555 --> 00:33:30,275
Okay. Thank you very much.

459
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,075
I'm sorry I'm late.
Your hair looks nice.

460
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:36,675
- I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid he left.
- He left.

461
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:38,715
- For the ball game.
- What?

462
00:33:38,915 --> 00:33:40,355
Yes, for the ball game.

463
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:43,315
- I thought he had a plane to catch.
- Plans changed.

464
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,515
But he did leave you this note.

465
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:55,235
- He didn't draw a smiley face, did he?
- What?

466
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:58,955
The previous assistant got him
in the habit of drawing a smiley fac"e..."

467
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:03,835
...instead of "sincerely," and I keep
telling him it's not always appropriate.

468
00:34:05,115 --> 00:34:07,195
No, it's perfectly appropriate.

469
00:34:28,396 --> 00:34:30,596
Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.

470
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:44,996
Hey, congratulations, fellas.

471
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:48,556
Hey, Babe- fucking-Ruth.

472
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,956
- William-fucking-Bendix.
- That's right.

473
00:34:51,596 --> 00:34:53,236
So did the kid see his home run?

474
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:55,156
The kid didn't even see it.

475
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:58,516
He slipped into a coma,
and he never pulled out. I'm sorry.

476
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,676
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Like you take bad news well.

477
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:06,076
What am I supposed to say?
"Great news, the kid didn't make it."

478
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:10,036
That's all right, man.
Enough of these hospital gigs.

479
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:12,996
They're off the list.
You know what the bright side is?

480
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:15,676
You knocked the cover off the ball.
You're back.

481
00:35:15,956 --> 00:35:17,876
The hell I did. It was a fluke.

482
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:19,996
I never even saw the pitch.

483
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:26,116
Let go, Tim.

484
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:30,916
- What do you want?
- How is he? He okay?

485
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:33,996
He's not. He's crying his eyes out.
What do you think?

486
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:36,476
- Come on, don't start.
- Don't you start.

487
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:38,996
You violated your agreement.
I called my lawyer.

488
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:40,996
I'm getting a restraining order.

489
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:43,476
- Don't start.
- No, don't you start. Go away.

490
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:46,956
- I've had it. I don't care what you want.
- Let me see him.

491
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:50,116
You had to bring him home?
What is wrong with you?

492
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:54,036
- I want you out. Tim, call the cops.
- I'm gonna explain to him.

493
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:57,116
- Come on, everything's okay.
- You bastard.

494
00:35:57,476 --> 00:36:00,836
You motherfucker! You cocksuck...!

495
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:03,156
- Hey.
- Tim!

496
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,676
Tim, call the cops. He fucking hit me!

497
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:11,116
Hey. Hey, slugger.

498
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:14,276
Slugger, I'm sorry. You forgive me?

499
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:16,597
- Hey.
- You left me.

500
00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:18,997
I know, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

501
00:36:19,157 --> 00:36:22,037
- You forgive Dad?
- Mom's got a terrible headache.

502
00:36:22,317 --> 00:36:24,717
Well, that's called a migraine.
She'll live.

503
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:28,077
Look what I got for you.
I got your favourite pizza.

504
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:32,997
Gil, open the door!

505
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:39,317
- Gil, open the door.
- It's got pepperoni and mushroom.

506
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,477
- I don't like mushrooms.
- You can pick them off.

507
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:48,237
Is it true, if Mom marries Tim,
I'm not gonna be a Renard anymore?

508
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:53,397
- Gil, open the door.
- It's open!

509
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:55,597
- It's locked.
- It's open.

510
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:59,157
It's locked, Gil. Open the door now.
I'm calling the police.

511
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,597
You still worried about the tryouts?

512
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:05,477
I don't know.
Think I'll make the majors?

513
00:37:05,877 --> 00:37:08,357
Of course you'll make it.
Remember what I said.

514
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:11,997
Positive things happen
to positive thinkers. Who said that?

515
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:14,997
- Coop.
- Damn straight.

516
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:18,157
He was the greatest player
I ever played with.

517
00:37:19,117 --> 00:37:21,037
Gil, unlock the door.

518
00:37:21,237 --> 00:37:22,477
Got you a Coke.

519
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:25,517
Call the cops.

520
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:28,317
Didn't you hear me? Call the cops!

521
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:30,997
Call the fucking police!

522
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:33,117
- I can't drink Coke.
- Who says?

523
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:36,197
Mom and Dad. I mean, Tim.

524
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:39,077
The door's locked. It's okay.

525
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:41,637
Gil, open the door.

526
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:50,277
Hey, Art.

527
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,637
I said, " Enough of this shit.
You sign the contract right now."

528
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:57,837
He signed it. I swear to God,
on my honour, he signed the contract.

529
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,877
Hey, Gil, got a second?

530
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,157
If you do. It's 8:00.

531
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:04,197
- Shall we?
- There you go.

532
00:38:05,437 --> 00:38:07,077
Sit down, Gil.

533
00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:10,517
That's okay, I'll stand.

534
00:38:10,797 --> 00:38:13,197
Chuck from McKinley and Everest
called yesterday.

535
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:17,597
Said they wanted to drop
their account with us.

536
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,797
I sent Figgy over there
to sort things out.

537
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,518
You sent Figgy down?

538
00:38:23,758 --> 00:38:25,878
- Sit down, Gil.
- Yeah, he sorted them out.

539
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:30,278
He did it with my opening-day tickets.
What are you gonna do about it?

540
00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:33,518
- He didn't steal your account.
- He did. What will you do?

541
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:35,558
We gave him your account.

542
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:38,598
I gave him your account.

543
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:41,478
What do you mean?

544
00:38:43,398 --> 00:38:45,318
You're not getting
the numbers we need.

545
00:38:45,718 --> 00:38:48,678
I know. It's been a little slow
last couple of months.

546
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:52,158
But that'll change. I've got
a new strategy. It's gonna work.

547
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:55,398
- Listen, your behaviour is unacceptable.
- What do you mean?

548
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:00,398
- People are scared of you.
- Why, because of the other day?

549
00:39:00,678 --> 00:39:03,918
You cannot do things like that
in this day and...

550
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:07,678
I want your reorder book.

551
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:12,198
Outstanding commissions
will be forwarded.

552
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:24,078
My father started this business.

553
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:28,678
Look, perfection and principles don't
belong in business, not now or then.

554
00:39:29,078 --> 00:39:31,838
- As a friend of your father's...
- Keep your mouth shut.

555
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,838
You know nothing about my father.

556
00:39:37,598 --> 00:39:40,398
- He made this business.
- Your father made knives.

557
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,438
- San Francisco made this business.
- By ripping him off.

558
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:46,038
He wasn't a businessman, Gil...

559
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,518
...and neither are you.

560
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:51,518
That's the bottom line.

561
00:40:24,118 --> 00:40:26,998
And so, in a Freudian sense, Jewel...

562
00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:30,159
... the catcher is the father,
and the son is the pitcher.

563
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,559
that's fascinating.
Let me ask you.

564
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:36,479
- What does the bat and ball represent?
- Well, the bat speaks for itself...

565
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,959
... and, of course,
the ball is the ejaculate.

566
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:42,039
Thanks for calling, doc.
Who do we have on line two?

567
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,319
- Do we have anybody on line two?
- I believe everybody hung up.

568
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,679
Hey, man. Hey, you got a van?
Kids are breaking into your van.

569
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:54,399
Somebody's breaking into your van.
Stop those kids. Cut that out.

570
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,799
- What?
- Kids breaking into a van out there.

571
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,679
- Yeah.
- Here, this is for you.

572
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:01,519
- What's that?
- Take it. Take it.

573
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:03,919
- Take it.
- What is it?

574
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:07,359
It's for you.
It's a temporary restraining order.

575
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:09,279
- What?
- You have been s"erve"d.

576
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,519
Hey, man, can I use your...?

577
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,799
Okay, last one.

578
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:19,719
Good swing. All right, who's next?

579
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:22,319
Eleven. Let's go, buddy.
Hustle up there.

580
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,159
- Okay, pal.
- Come on, Rich.

581
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,479
Okay, watch the ball.

582
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,559
Good swing.

583
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,559
Next one, Richie.

584
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,119
Attaway, Richie boy.

585
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,159
- That's okay.
- He's throwing too hard.

586
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,839
He almost took his head off.
Hey, coach. Coach.

587
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,759
- Yeah.
- Slow down.

588
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,639
- This is Little League. Little League.
- I know.

589
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,599
- Leave him alone, Gil.
- Mind your fucking business.

590
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,039
Hey, coach, mix in some strikes.
What are you doing?

591
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,639
- You're making it hard.
- I'll coach from here.

592
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:08,279
- Mix in some strikes.
- He's throwing strikes, Gil.

593
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,159
- Fuck it, I'm gonna go down.
- Easy, Gil.

594
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:13,999
Remember, Ellen's got
that restraining order on you.

595
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,999
- The bat is too fucking heavy.
- Come on.

596
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,199
You fuck with me,
I'll send your head into the outfield.

597
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,679
Go easy. You're letting the bat
swing him.

598
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:32,519
- Hey, hey, come on, you guy.
- Look how heavy this bat is.

599
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,240
Here.

600
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,960
Let go of my son.

601
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,760
- He's my son too.
- Don't remind me. Get off him.

602
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,800
- He's my son too.
- You are not gonna ruin our lives.

603
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,360
- Tim, call the cops now.
- I'm just trying to tell him something.

604
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,280
Get out of here. Tim!

605
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,520
You get out of here.
Can't you read, stupid?

606
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,760
The restraining order says
you have to stay 100 yards away.

607
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,560
- Tell him one thing.
- You can't come near him.

608
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,320
- I wanna tell him one thing.
- Get out of here.

609
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,200
- I just wanna tell him one thing.
- You better go.

610
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,840
Don't swing at anything.
Wait for a good one.

611
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,400
Step on the eggshell,
squash the bug. Okay?

612
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,880
You mind your fucking business.
You're lucky.

613
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,920
Just give him... Give him something.
He's a kid.

614
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,320
It's okay. Play ball.

615
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,360
Bobby Rayburn again
failed to earn his k eep.

616
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,160
Almost grounding into
a game-ending double play...

617
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,160
... just beating the throw to first.

618
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,280
When the Giants
needed a pick-me-up...

619
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,720
... number 11, Juan Primo,
}provides San Francisco with a lift.

620
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,560
And it was a big one. His two-run
shot over the left-field fence...

621
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,360
... scored Rayburn,
and the Giants went home happy.

622
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,920
That is, except possibly
Bobby Rayburn...

623
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,760
... whose lackof hitting is giving
new meaning to the term "three hole."

624
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,760
The way Primo's carried
this team on his shoulders...

625
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,800
... mak es you wonder who the real
$40 million player is.

626
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,080
Lanz came up with a big hit to drive
in a k ey run in the Giants' victory.

627
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,840
Jimmy has been a spark plug
during this home stand.

628
00:45:05,481 --> 00:45:07,601
Motherfuck.

629
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:33,201
Ladies and gentlemen, now batting,
the centre fielder, number 33...

630
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:36,281
... Bobby Rayburn.

631
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,241
All right, Bobby, let's go!

632
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:54,801
All right, Bobby.

633
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,041
Strike.

634
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:19,721
Strike.

635
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:26,841
- Strike thr"ee."
- Shit.

636
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:30,081
Ladies and gentlemen,
with courtesy to the players...

637
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:32,761
... please refrain
from excessive noise...

638
00:46:33,161 --> 00:46:36,121
... and throwing anything
onto the field. Thank you.

639
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:39,561
Forty-million-dollar man's
paying off, huh?

640
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:44,961
Now batting, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

641
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,802
Well, here it is, Memorial Day weekend.

642
00:46:49,082 --> 00:46:52,802
You think back to the opening-day
grand slam, doesn't seem long ago.

643
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:55,962
But lately, Bobby Rayburn
has really had difficulties...

644
00:46:56,162 --> 00:46:59,442
... and can't seem to find his strok e.
He lacks aggressiveness.

645
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:02,322
And you start to wonder
when you call it a slump.

646
00:47:02,682 --> 00:47:05,002
Most superstars aren't gonna
sit down for you.

647
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:06,642
But you gotta wonder...

648
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:09,402
... when he's gonna
breakout of this thing.

649
00:47:15,922 --> 00:47:16,882
Strike.

650
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:28,682
Come on, Bobby. Come on.

651
00:47:54,482 --> 00:47:55,922
Out.

652
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:06,362
Now batting, number 46, Jimmy Lanz.

653
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,482
You'll be all right.

654
00:48:13,562 --> 00:48:15,562
You still want that interview?

655
00:48:16,442 --> 00:48:20,202
You'd let Bobby Rayburn do an
interview with a...? What was it?

656
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:24,002
- Castrating ball-buster.
- Castrating ball-buster, that's it.

657
00:48:24,322 --> 00:48:26,882
- I thought I was off your list.
- Come on.

658
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:29,002
Schindler has a list, not me, okay?

659
00:48:29,202 --> 00:48:32,162
When you're hitting.183,
you don't get to have a list.

660
00:48:36,602 --> 00:48:38,322
Lock er room.

661
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,882
- "Giants' lock er room."
- Bobby Rayburn.

662
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:44,242
- "Yeah, who's calling?"
- A friend of his. I have to talk to him.

663
00:48:44,642 --> 00:48:46,162
It's really important.

664
00:48:46,362 --> 00:48:48,082
Rayburn, phone.

665
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:52,203
- Yeah, this is Bobby.
- "Bobby?"

666
00:48:52,523 --> 00:48:54,883
- Yeah.
- Bobby Rayburn.

667
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,203
"Yes. Yes, who is this"?

668
00:48:57,403 --> 00:49:00,283
Hello. Look, say something.

669
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,003
Hello?

670
00:49:02,963 --> 00:49:06,603
Yo, Stook, I thought you were
supposed to screen my calls here.

671
00:49:33,163 --> 00:49:35,283
- Burn, baby, burn.
- Come on, give me some.

672
00:49:35,483 --> 00:49:38,443
- What's up, Dad? Gaining a little weight.
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

673
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,883
- Stopped by the doughnut spot.
- Cool. Is he for me?

674
00:49:42,163 --> 00:49:43,803
Yeah, he's for you.

675
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:45,843
What's his name?

676
00:49:46,003 --> 00:49:49,083
- He told me it's Bradley.
- What else did he say, Dr. Dolittle?

677
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:53,123
Dad, how come
you haven't been hitting?

678
00:50:00,323 --> 00:50:01,843
How's the rib cage, Bobby?

679
00:50:02,123 --> 00:50:04,443
My rib cage is sick
of people asking about it.

680
00:50:04,723 --> 00:50:07,203
They say you should've
came out that first gam"e..."

681
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:10,203
...but you were hot-dogging,
so you screwed yourself.

682
00:50:10,363 --> 00:50:13,643
That supposed to be a dis
or something? I hit.314 last season.

683
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:16,723
- That's bullshit.
- I'm telling you what people say.

684
00:50:17,003 --> 00:50:18,723
I can put a positive spin on this.

685
00:50:19,283 --> 00:50:21,003
- How?
- How? I'll tell you how.

686
00:50:21,203 --> 00:50:23,603
We set up an interview,
get a piece out of it.

687
00:50:23,883 --> 00:50:27,083
You tell the people why you stayed in.
It's for the kid in chemo.

688
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:30,523
You get public sympathy.
I smell forgiveness in the Bay Area.

689
00:50:30,883 --> 00:50:33,963
- Is that exploiting the kid's death?
- Not comfortable with it?

690
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:36,843
- Should I be?
- I think you should be.

691
00:50:39,043 --> 00:50:40,283
Well, I don't think I am.

692
00:50:50,163 --> 00:50:53,643
Excuse me. I'll have a vodka
and orange juice, please.

693
00:50:55,243 --> 00:50:57,563
And whatever the lady wants.

694
00:50:58,244 --> 00:51:00,164
Jackon the rocks, thanks.

695
00:51:03,324 --> 00:51:04,644
What?

696
00:51:08,324 --> 00:51:11,084
Oh, shit. I did it again, didn't I?

697
00:51:11,364 --> 00:51:14,844
No, it's okay.
I'm used to all of this interview shit.

698
00:51:22,484 --> 00:51:25,644
Look, no offence intended,
but it's no secret...

699
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:28,924
...that you're playing like shit.
It's gotta be affecting you.

700
00:51:29,324 --> 00:51:30,764
Of course it's affecting me.

701
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:33,804
I'm paid to produce.
I can't even hit the side of a barn.

702
00:51:34,084 --> 00:51:38,324
- How do you think it makes me feel?
- Do you know what I think, Mr. Rayburn?

703
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,284
No, but I'm quite sure
you're gonna tell me.

704
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,524
I think the slump is a good thing.

705
00:51:45,884 --> 00:51:47,804
Now, what kind of twisted shit is that?

706
00:51:48,404 --> 00:51:51,444
It's gonna teach you
to cut yourself a little slack.

707
00:51:52,124 --> 00:51:54,804
- You can't keep up this act forever.
- Now it's an act.

708
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:59,324
Oh, yeah, Mr. Perfect. Mr. No-Error.
Nobody can live up to that shit.

709
00:51:59,724 --> 00:52:02,764
You gotta give yourself a break.
It's just a lie anyhow.

710
00:52:03,244 --> 00:52:07,284
Yeah. It doesn't seem like a lie
when I'm hitting.

711
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:11,324
Now batting for the Giants,
number 11...

712
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:14,364
... the right fielder, Juan Primo.

713
00:52:17,244 --> 00:52:19,644
Sit down, let Bobby bat!

714
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:35,284
He's a hot dog. He's lucky.

715
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:43,044
Now batting, number 11, Juan Primo.

716
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:09,445
Now batting, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

717
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:14,125
Let's play some fucking ball!

718
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:16,725
Thanks, Primo.

719
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:25,525
Fuck you, Rayburn.

720
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:36,285
- You suck.
- Bobby, Bobby.

721
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:41,925
You suck!

722
00:53:42,245 --> 00:53:43,965
Don't listen to them, Bobby!

723
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:28,205
Okay.

724
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:35,485
Line drive to the right.

725
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:38,085
Don't tell me
where it's gonna go, Dad.

726
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:10,406
I wish we had a whole team
like him.

727
00:55:13,966 --> 00:55:15,206
Fuckin' asshole!

728
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:23,846
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Nikki. The usual.

729
00:55:24,046 --> 00:55:27,326
- Alrighty.
- Hey, Bob.

730
00:55:37,086 --> 00:55:38,326
You guys wanna play pool?

731
00:55:38,926 --> 00:55:41,126
- What a waste of space.
- What do you mean?

732
00:55:41,326 --> 00:55:44,486
He hit a bad patch.
We all hit bad patches, don't we?

733
00:55:45,806 --> 00:55:49,086
- You never hit a bad patch?
- No, this is my dream job.

734
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:57,726
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Please, man.

735
00:55:57,926 --> 00:56:01,926
These guys come to relax. You bug
them, they're gonna stop coming here.

736
00:56:02,406 --> 00:56:04,806
I know him. I've talked to him
on the phone.

737
00:56:06,726 --> 00:56:08,366
Hey, Bob.

738
00:56:12,406 --> 00:56:14,326
Can I talk to you for a second?

739
00:56:15,086 --> 00:56:17,966
- Sure. You wanna talk to me?
- Maybe we can go someplace.

740
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:20,446
- Let me finish the game.
- Okay.

741
00:56:27,246 --> 00:56:29,646
Primo, it's late, man. All right?

742
00:56:30,046 --> 00:56:33,206
- Tell me what it is you want.
- I want nothing.

743
00:56:33,966 --> 00:56:36,086
You don't understand
how things work here.

744
00:56:36,366 --> 00:56:38,766
Because it's different
from where you come from.

745
00:56:39,726 --> 00:56:41,086
What's different?

746
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:44,526
Look, when a player like me
comes into a team like this...

747
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:46,726
...hey, man, shit gets worked out.

748
00:56:46,926 --> 00:56:49,326
Right? You don't...
What is the problem with that?

749
00:56:52,846 --> 00:56:55,366
What kind of uniforms
do you have down there?

750
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,806
- Just uniforms.
- Like these pussy pants you're wearing?

751
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:01,606
- What...? What colour?
- Blue.

752
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:05,726
- What number is on the backof yours?
- Eleven.

753
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:10,526
Primo, what is your price?

754
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:14,446
No price. You already
had a chance, baby. Okay?

755
00:57:14,727 --> 00:57:17,687
- What's your fucking price?
- Go fuck yourself.

756
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:21,247
- Hey, don't walk away from me, man.
- Fuck you.

757
00:57:22,767 --> 00:57:24,807
Motherfucker. What?

758
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:31,687
- Break it up!
- Get off of him.

759
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:37,927
- I want my fucking number, man.
- Chill out.

760
00:57:39,647 --> 00:57:41,767
What are we talking about
Juan Primo for...

761
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:46,087
...when we've got Bobby Rayburn where
we want him, up close and exclusive.

762
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:48,407
Are you ready for your next caller?

763
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:50,207
- Let's get another caller.
- Bobby.

764
00:57:50,487 --> 00:57:54,127
- You guys are getting a kickout of this.
- What are you talking about?

765
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:57,487
I'm talking about my season is like
a bad freeway accident.

766
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,207
And you guys, you're just
slowing down to watch.

767
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:03,527
I thought I'd enjoy this,
but the fact is, I feel for you.

768
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,447
I didn't know it'd be so rough.

769
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:09,967
Who we talking to? On the car phone,
we are talking to Gil.

770
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:13,527
Hey, is that our old buddy Gil?
Mr. Magical-Conjunction himself.

771
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:16,207
- Is this Jewel?
- You're on the air. Go ahead.

772
00:58:16,487 --> 00:58:18,807
You're getting break-up
on the line here.

773
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:22,447
- I heard what you said about Primo.
- What's your question for Bobby?

774
00:58:22,927 --> 00:58:25,327
Is Bobby listening? Bobby?
Hey, Bob?

775
00:58:25,687 --> 00:58:27,807
Yeah, Gil, I'm here, man.
How you doing?

776
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:31,567
I wanna tell you that I know exactly
what you're going through...

777
00:58:31,927 --> 00:58:36,447
...more than you'll ever understand.
This number 11 thing is a fucking joke.

778
00:58:36,727 --> 00:58:39,407
You're the greatest player
this city's ever had...

779
00:58:39,607 --> 00:58:42,687
...and you got some hot-dogger
like Primo...

780
00:58:43,047 --> 00:58:44,967
...giving you a hard time
about your number.

781
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:47,007
There's a reason
you're paid 40 million.

782
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:49,567
The owners aren't doing
what they should be.

783
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:52,247
They should be protecting
their investment.

784
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:54,487
Pay him. Give him what he wants.

785
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:56,767
If he wants a million, give it to him.

786
00:58:57,047 --> 00:59:00,687
If he doesn't want it and doesn't want
to give up his number, fuck him.

787
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:04,167
Get him out. What's the difference?
Just get you hitting again.

788
00:59:04,447 --> 00:59:07,807
- Lf that's what it's gonna take.
- They say fans don't know...

789
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:12,127
...what they're talking about. The public
and the owners should listen to you.

790
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:14,607
Bobby, why isn't this guy
on your payroll?

791
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:19,007
Thanks, Gil. Maybe I should have you
try and talk some sense into Primo.

792
00:59:19,608 --> 00:59:21,528
God knows I need
all the help I can get.

793
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:26,888
They say fans don't know
what they're talking about.

794
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:29,488
The public and the owners
should listen to you.

795
00:59:29,768 --> 00:59:31,968
Bobby, why isn't this guy
on your payroll?

796
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:36,288
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

797
00:59:37,248 --> 00:59:40,968
The owners should listen to you. Bobby,
why isn't this guy on your payroll?

798
00:59:41,368 --> 00:59:44,648
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

799
00:59:45,088 --> 00:59:48,368
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

800
00:59:48,648 --> 00:59:51,248
God knows I need all the help
I can get.

801
01:00:01,888 --> 01:00:04,848
Primo. Primo, lots of luck.

802
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:06,488
Primo.

803
01:00:50,128 --> 01:00:51,848
Mr. Primo?

804
01:00:53,688 --> 01:00:56,648
- Yeah?
- Can I just say...?

805
01:00:58,368 --> 01:01:01,368
Did you ever think how one man
who's doing well...

806
01:01:01,648 --> 01:01:04,408
...might throw off
the rest of the team?

807
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:09,968
I'm saying, you have to thinkof
what's best for the team, right?

808
01:01:10,568 --> 01:01:13,728
You might have to
lay down a sacrifice.

809
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:16,688
I'm talking about
Bobby Rayburn's number.

810
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:20,728
I don't know if you understand
how much he needs that number.

811
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:23,688
- Number 11.
- I am number 11.

812
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,048
I know, but he needs it
more than you.

813
01:01:36,249 --> 01:01:37,809
Are you with the press?

814
01:01:40,089 --> 01:01:41,449
You with the hotel?

815
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:49,489
Then get out of here.

816
01:01:53,049 --> 01:01:54,289
Go.

817
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:13,969
Get the fuckout of here.

818
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,770
It's a sad night here at the Stick
as the Giants tak e the field...

819
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:54,250
... for the first time since the murder
of hitting sensation Juan Primo.

820
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:57,530
Rayburn will take his place
in the lineup batting cleanup.

821
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,490
There's bound to be questions
about that, Jewel.

822
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,930
Now we all get to wear
the number, man.

823
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,330
Come on, let's play ball!

824
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:31,330
Now batting fourth, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

825
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:35,450
Bobby! Come on, Bobby!

826
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,210
Fuck you.

827
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:52,811
Come on, Bob!

828
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:15,171
That's it.

829
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:25,131
Come on, Bob!

830
01:06:25,411 --> 01:06:27,611
Attaway. You're back to your old self.

831
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:37,691
Fuck you.

832
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:45,171
This is the last place I'll look.
Then I'll quit.

833
01:06:45,451 --> 01:06:48,531
Yeah, no, I've had it. I'm tired.
I mean, he's not here.

834
01:06:48,891 --> 01:06:52,371
There he is. I found my man.
I'll talk to you later.

835
01:06:58,691 --> 01:07:01,651
Is this how you celebrate
going four for four, huh?

836
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,651
What happened to pouring
champagne over your head...

837
01:07:05,011 --> 01:07:06,931
...and banging some groupies, huh?

838
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,771
Bobby. Bobby, talk to me.

839
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:13,851
If the cops worry you,
they're not interested in you.

840
01:07:14,211 --> 01:07:17,011
It's just an ongoing investigation.
Let it go.

841
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:19,011
I didn't ask for this, man.

842
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:22,491
You talking about Primo?
Come on, I know that's shit.

843
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:26,331
I thought about it a lot,
but I didn't ask for this.

844
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:30,051
You know, Bobsy...

845
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:32,931
...I wish five people dead
on my drive to work.

846
01:07:33,211 --> 01:07:35,811
Five people. But wishing it
doesn't make it so.

847
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:38,491
You're not God,
lifetime average withstanding.

848
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:42,051
Yeah? Well...

849
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:44,531
...why do I feel so bad then, huh?

850
01:07:45,092 --> 01:07:46,452
I don't know.

851
01:07:46,932 --> 01:07:48,172
I don't...

852
01:07:48,572 --> 01:07:51,452
This is gonna blow the hell
out of my shithead theory...

853
01:07:51,732 --> 01:07:53,532
...but I think you feel guilty.

854
01:07:54,412 --> 01:07:55,932
Jesus-hairy-Christ.

855
01:07:56,412 --> 01:07:57,772
I've been wrong about you.

856
01:07:58,052 --> 01:08:00,532
You're not a shithead at all.
I'm flabbergasted.

857
01:08:00,852 --> 01:08:03,252
Come on, let's go, man.
I got a game tomorrow.

858
01:08:15,052 --> 01:08:18,292
Number 33, Bobby Rayburn.

859
01:08:21,652 --> 01:08:24,892
Go, Bobby! Bobby!

860
01:08:28,652 --> 01:08:30,092
Safe.

861
01:08:34,772 --> 01:08:37,092
Bobby Rayburn.

862
01:08:42,092 --> 01:08:44,572
You're coming off
the worst slump in your career.

863
01:08:44,852 --> 01:08:49,252
All of a sudden, you're hitting well over
.400, 11 home runs, 30 RBIs last month.

864
01:08:49,652 --> 01:08:50,892
How do you explain this?

865
01:08:51,492 --> 01:08:52,932
I wish I knew.

866
01:08:53,972 --> 01:08:55,812
That's it? You wish you knew?

867
01:08:58,572 --> 01:09:00,292
A "thank you" would've been nice.

868
01:09:16,972 --> 01:09:18,252
Sean!

869
01:09:18,812 --> 01:09:20,452
Be careful!

870
01:09:23,812 --> 01:09:25,732
Don't go too far!

871
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,732
Sean, don't go too far, darling.

872
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:36,652
Bradley!

873
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:38,572
Bradley, come here!

874
01:09:44,052 --> 01:09:45,372
Bradley, come back.

875
01:09:50,573 --> 01:09:52,373
Go back, Bradley. Go back.

876
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:56,133
Sean!

877
01:10:01,693 --> 01:10:03,413
Sean!

878
01:10:03,693 --> 01:10:06,573
Mr. Rayburn!

879
01:10:10,133 --> 01:10:11,253
Shit.

880
01:10:16,453 --> 01:10:17,973
Mr. Rayburn!

881
01:10:46,773 --> 01:10:47,813
Sean!

882
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,653
- Thank God for Mark Spitz over here.
- Jeez.

883
01:11:20,133 --> 01:11:23,973
Okay. Just relax. Go on.
That's right, blow it out.

884
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,613
It's gonna be all right.

885
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:27,133
Are you all right, man?

886
01:11:27,893 --> 01:11:29,893
- Just relax.
- He swallowed some water.

887
01:11:30,293 --> 01:11:32,693
Jesus. You scared me half to death.

888
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:34,813
Where did you come from?

889
01:11:35,013 --> 01:11:38,933
I was just walking on the beach,
I saw him in the water, and I went in.

890
01:11:39,293 --> 01:11:41,893
Thank God, man. You all right?

891
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:45,533
Sean, you gotta promise me,
no matter what...

892
01:11:45,813 --> 01:11:47,933
...not a word to your mother,
understand?

893
01:11:48,213 --> 01:11:51,573
Next time you're looking
for attention, be more dramatic.

894
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:55,333
- Let's get some dry clothes.
- Play in traffic like the other kids.

895
01:11:55,614 --> 01:11:57,734
- That little bonehead.
- Oh, shit.

896
01:12:01,094 --> 01:12:03,974
- What did you say your name was?
- My friends call me Curly.

897
01:12:04,134 --> 01:12:08,374
Curly. Well, come on, Curly,
let's go inside.

898
01:12:09,134 --> 01:12:12,294
Elvira will get you some
dry clothes, all right?

899
01:12:15,294 --> 01:12:16,894
Thank you.

900
01:13:16,094 --> 01:13:18,854
- What do I say?
- Well, you know, I was just there.

901
01:13:19,134 --> 01:13:20,854
You would've done the same thing.

902
01:13:21,174 --> 01:13:23,934
If I lose this guy, man,
I don't know what I would do.

903
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:26,334
Looks good on you.

904
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:28,534
I don't know
about them pants, though.

905
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:30,374
They're yours.

906
01:13:30,654 --> 01:13:32,574
- Can I get you anything?
- A beer.

907
01:13:32,854 --> 01:13:36,974
Yeah, all right. I could swear...
Have I seen you before?

908
01:13:37,374 --> 01:13:40,934
I get that all the time.
I got one of those faces, I guess.

909
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:46,094
You like baseball?

910
01:13:46,574 --> 01:13:49,854
I'm not obsessed with it or anything.
Are you a player?

911
01:13:50,494 --> 01:13:52,534
Yeah.

912
01:13:52,814 --> 01:13:54,534
- You are?
- Yeah.

913
01:13:56,734 --> 01:13:58,574
Barry Bonds?

914
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:03,934
No. No. I'm Bobby Rayburn.

915
01:14:04,335 --> 01:14:05,855
- Right.
- Yeah.

916
01:14:06,135 --> 01:14:09,975
- I was just kidding you.
- It's okay.

917
01:14:10,935 --> 01:14:14,095
At least you're not one of them
die- hard baseball fans who...

918
01:14:14,295 --> 01:14:15,535
Why is that?

919
01:14:15,815 --> 01:14:17,455
Because those guys are losers.

920
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,815
Aren't the fans what it's all about?

921
01:14:22,055 --> 01:14:24,855
Shit. Tell you something, man.

922
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:28,855
The fans are like women.
When you're hitting, they love you.

923
01:14:29,175 --> 01:14:32,615
And when you're not, they'd as soon
spit on you as look at you.

924
01:14:32,975 --> 01:14:34,775
Why is that?

925
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:40,135
Because they don't understand that
you're the same person hitting or not.

926
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:42,975
You know?

927
01:14:43,455 --> 01:14:46,055
Only person you should play for
is yourself.

928
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:53,455
Hey, you wanna shoot some pool?

929
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:55,735
Yeah, sure.

930
01:14:56,015 --> 01:14:58,295
- All right. Bring the beer.
- Sure.

931
01:15:04,215 --> 01:15:07,655
Curly, Curly"..."

932
01:15:10,055 --> 01:15:11,495
Curly Otis?

933
01:15:11,695 --> 01:15:13,615
- Yeah, that's my old man.
- No shit.

934
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:17,455
I was in bigs for a cup of coffee myself
until my arm went south.

935
01:15:17,815 --> 01:15:19,735
Man, tough break.

936
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:22,415
It's like my old catcher Coop
used to say:

937
01:15:22,695 --> 01:15:24,935
"Enjoy it while you got it,
then move on."

938
01:15:25,495 --> 01:15:26,735
Yeah.

939
01:15:28,455 --> 01:15:32,015
That's a good philosophy, brother.
Good philosophy.

940
01:15:35,095 --> 01:15:38,135
- Are all those hats yours?
- Yep, my pride and joy.

941
01:15:38,815 --> 01:15:41,215
- Could I try one on?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

942
01:15:50,615 --> 01:15:52,135
Fits.

943
01:15:52,535 --> 01:15:54,455
Looks good on you.

944
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:58,855
Hey, Bobby...

945
01:16:00,415 --> 01:16:02,895
...did you mean it?
You'd do something for me?

946
01:16:03,095 --> 01:16:05,975
Yeah, sure. I mean, within reason,
you know.

947
01:16:06,175 --> 01:16:07,495
Don't be getting no ideas.

948
01:16:08,056 --> 01:16:09,696
- Let me pitch to you.
- What?

949
01:16:09,896 --> 01:16:13,736
Let me show you what I got.
I got a couple innings left in me.

950
01:16:14,016 --> 01:16:16,616
Come on, Bobby,
let me show you what I got.

951
01:16:17,936 --> 01:16:20,256
Bradley's gonna catch for us.

952
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:30,536
Must feel good
to be hitting again, huh?

953
01:16:30,816 --> 01:16:33,576
Brother, you have no idea.

954
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:37,336
- How did you get out of that slump?
- Say what?

955
01:16:38,096 --> 01:16:40,976
Got any idea what got you
out of that slump?

956
01:16:41,936 --> 01:16:43,856
You know, Curly...

957
01:16:44,536 --> 01:16:46,736
...I just stopped caring, man.

958
01:16:47,776 --> 01:16:50,736
- What?
- I just stopped caring.

959
01:16:51,056 --> 01:16:52,776
You stopped caring?

960
01:16:53,056 --> 01:16:54,496
What do you mean?

961
01:16:56,616 --> 01:16:59,176
All my life I've been working
to be the best.

962
01:16:59,376 --> 01:17:02,176
You know?
Trying to be a perfectionist.

963
01:17:02,656 --> 01:17:07,136
And I thought about it. That's probably
where I made my mistake.

964
01:17:08,696 --> 01:17:13,016
And when Juan Primo died, man, that
completely changed the perspective.

965
01:17:13,376 --> 01:17:14,816
I mean"..."

966
01:17:15,096 --> 01:17:17,136
I mean, come on, let's be real here.

967
01:17:17,896 --> 01:17:21,136
What are we doing? We're not
curing cancer, you know?

968
01:17:21,616 --> 01:17:23,376
We're playing a game.

969
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:25,856
That's all it is. It's just a game.

970
01:17:26,256 --> 01:17:29,496
So I stopped caring and relaxed...

971
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:32,176
...and I started hitting.

972
01:17:32,576 --> 01:17:34,096
Stopped caring.

973
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:37,936
So that's your fucking insight
into life?

974
01:17:39,096 --> 01:17:40,816
Just stop caring.

975
01:17:46,176 --> 01:17:48,856
- You're pretty loose now, aren't you?
- Yeah.

976
01:17:49,816 --> 01:17:53,096
All I'm saying is that there's
more to life than just baseball.

977
01:17:53,456 --> 01:17:55,296
Like what? Like your house?

978
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:58,856
Like your bigass car?
Like your 40-fucking-million?

979
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:03,176
I mean, what the fuck
do you care about?

980
01:18:03,456 --> 01:18:06,216
I care about my son.
That's what I care about.

981
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:11,016
I'm sorry. I just hate that attitude,
you stopped caring. I'm sorry.

982
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:13,536
What, do you have a better theory?

983
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:15,337
Yeah.

984
01:18:15,897 --> 01:18:17,537
You got your number back.

985
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:22,617
Curly, my number didn't have
anything to do with it.

986
01:18:40,457 --> 01:18:42,497
It looks good on you.

987
01:18:43,617 --> 01:18:44,977
Thanks.

988
01:18:50,057 --> 01:18:53,417
- That's great.
- I still haven't given you my best pitch.

989
01:18:53,697 --> 01:18:56,177
- Sure you have.
- No.

990
01:18:57,937 --> 01:18:59,257
Okay.

991
01:18:59,457 --> 01:19:03,697
Look, Curly, I really want to thank you
for what you did for my son.

992
01:19:04,537 --> 01:19:07,217
You know, what do you say?
Let's call it a night?

993
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:08,857
All right.

994
01:19:11,937 --> 01:19:15,657
Come on, admit it. We're alone.

995
01:19:17,577 --> 01:19:19,417
Admit what?

996
01:19:19,697 --> 01:19:22,297
Admit you're hitting
because Primo's not around.

997
01:19:23,737 --> 01:19:25,737
That's a bunch of bullshit.
Come on.

998
01:19:25,937 --> 01:19:28,217
It doesn't hurt he's not around.

999
01:19:29,377 --> 01:19:31,297
Come on, level with me.

1000
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:35,217
Level with me.

1001
01:19:35,617 --> 01:19:38,777
Come on, I saved your kid.
You wanna pay me back?

1002
01:19:39,057 --> 01:19:42,537
Be honest with me and tell me
you're a little happy that he's dead.

1003
01:19:42,897 --> 01:19:46,657
- Hey.
- No, no. I'm not happy that he's dead.

1004
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:49,617
Come on.

1005
01:19:49,817 --> 01:19:52,217
Curly. Curly, I already told you no.

1006
01:19:52,857 --> 01:19:56,217
No, I am not happy
that he's dead. Okay?

1007
01:19:57,577 --> 01:20:01,017
Okay? Can I have my hand back now?

1008
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:02,937
Thanks.

1009
01:20:06,697 --> 01:20:11,017
I'm really tired. Really.
I'm going to sleep. Take care.

1010
01:20:11,497 --> 01:20:13,577
Simple "thank you"
would have been nic"e..."

1011
01:20:13,777 --> 01:20:16,097
...for a teammate
who lays down a sacrifice.

1012
01:20:17,617 --> 01:20:19,937
Hey, look,
you need a ride or anything?

1013
01:20:20,098 --> 01:20:22,418
I got my own wheels. Thanks, Bob.

1014
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:24,418
Good. Bradley, let's go.

1015
01:20:24,698 --> 01:20:26,938
If you need anything,
just call me, all right?

1016
01:20:27,298 --> 01:20:29,498
And I'll get back to you.
Okay, bye.

1017
01:20:29,818 --> 01:20:31,818
Take care. Come on, Bradley.

1018
01:20:33,058 --> 01:20:34,578
Hey, Bob?

1019
01:20:35,058 --> 01:20:37,578
Bobby. What about the glove, Bob?

1020
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:39,098
Keep it!

1021
01:21:18,538 --> 01:21:21,098
I remember when Mick recorded this.
December '77.

1022
01:21:21,778 --> 01:21:23,698
We drove home at dawn.

1023
01:21:25,818 --> 01:21:27,538
Who's Mick?

1024
01:21:27,818 --> 01:21:29,818
A great friend of mine.

1025
01:21:30,618 --> 01:21:32,818
- Where we going?
- We're going fishing.

1026
01:21:33,178 --> 01:21:35,418
- Why can't my dad come?
- Your dad could come.

1027
01:21:35,698 --> 01:21:38,938
But he has a big game tomorrow,
and we gotta pick up Coop.

1028
01:21:43,058 --> 01:21:44,698
Why are we fishing at night?

1029
01:21:44,978 --> 01:21:47,778
Night fishing is best. No boats
to scare the fish away.

1030
01:21:48,538 --> 01:21:51,778
We'll sucker them in with a flashlight,
cut them up with this.

1031
01:21:52,178 --> 01:21:54,178
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

1032
01:21:54,858 --> 01:21:57,058
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's yours. Take it.

1033
01:21:57,658 --> 01:22:00,418
- Well, thanks.
- Just don't cut yourself.

1034
01:22:27,939 --> 01:22:30,059
- Hello.
- Hey, Curly.

1035
01:22:30,339 --> 01:22:32,179
Hey, Bobby. Hey.

1036
01:22:32,459 --> 01:22:34,659
Say hello to your father.
He's on the phone.

1037
01:22:34,939 --> 01:22:36,699
Hi, Dad. We're going fishing.

1038
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:38,619
That's great. That's great, Sean.

1039
01:22:38,899 --> 01:22:42,419
Listen, Curly, could you
pick up the handset so we could talk?

1040
01:22:42,819 --> 01:22:44,459
Sure thing, slugger.

1041
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:47,979
- Yeah.
- Curly, is it raining where you are?

1042
01:22:48,299 --> 01:22:51,339
- No, I'm far from the beach.
- Didn't know you'd take the car.

1043
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:55,499
- I thought the kid, he'd like to get away.
- Listen, Curly...

1044
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:59,499
...before you do anything stupid,
I don't think this is a good idea.

1045
01:22:59,779 --> 01:23:01,699
You don't think. You're a lucky idiot.

1046
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:03,339
I'm not fucking with you.

1047
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:05,939
- All right.
- Don't get angry at me, Bob.

1048
01:23:06,219 --> 01:23:07,259
- Curly?
- Bob?

1049
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:09,499
I just want my son back.

1050
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:10,739
- Bob?
- What?

1051
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:11,979
- Bobby.
- What?!

1052
01:23:12,179 --> 01:23:16,499
Listen to you. You're hanging on every
word I say. This is really something.

1053
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:19,459
Curly, what do you want?
What do you want from me?

1054
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:26,179
Don't talk back.
You show me some respect.

1055
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:28,659
Without people like me,
you're nothing.

1056
01:23:29,619 --> 01:23:31,819
We're the ones that get you
your 40 million.

1057
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:36,419
- Look, what do you want?
- What do I want?

1058
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:40,459
I want when they thinkof you,
they thinkof me.

1059
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:44,299
Curly, I don't know what the fuck
I did to you to piss you off...

1060
01:23:44,579 --> 01:23:47,259
...but my son has nothing
to do with this.

1061
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:53,419
Oh, Bobby, it's not what you did to me,
it's what I did for you, number 11.

1062
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,699
- You owe me.
- I owe you what?

1063
01:23:56,659 --> 01:23:58,219
Check your freezer.

1064
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:00,419
I'll hang on.

1065
01:24:00,979 --> 01:24:03,299
- There's a surprise.
- What the f...? Curly.

1066
01:24:03,459 --> 01:24:07,299
- Go ahead, check your freezer.
- All right, I'll check the freezer.

1067
01:24:07,699 --> 01:24:09,419
Curly, don't hang up this phone.

1068
01:24:09,619 --> 01:24:11,419
You hear me?

1069
01:24:11,899 --> 01:24:13,059
Oh, my God!

1070
01:24:19,219 --> 01:24:22,099
He finally figures it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

1071
01:24:22,379 --> 01:24:24,659
It's really true what they say
about sluggers.

1072
01:24:24,939 --> 01:24:26,979
They are really, really stupid.

1073
01:24:27,339 --> 01:24:32,059
Well, I'm a pitcher, Bobby.
Pitchers use their brains.

1074
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,300
Come on, Bradley.

1075
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:56,700
We'll play a joke on him,
so you just play along.

1076
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,540
- All right.
- Okay?

1077
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,060
Hey, Coop.

1078
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,420
Gil.

1079
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:18,580
Gil.

1080
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:21,140
- Gil Renard.
- Yeah.

1081
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,060
Gil Renard.

1082
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,580
Yeah, long time no see, Gil.

1083
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:29,020
- This is my son.
- Hi.

1084
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,700
Come on in, fellas.

1085
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,420
Go ahead.

1086
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:51,180
Man, that is a kick-ass car.
You done good for yourself.

1087
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:54,420
You never see nothing like that
in the Bronx.

1088
01:25:54,820 --> 01:25:57,020
I always thought
you'd be managing by now.

1089
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,140
- Managing?
- Yeah, in the majors.

1090
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:02,500
Nobody calls me Coop anymore,
you sick son of a bitch.

1091
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,180
How'd you find me anyway?

1092
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,860
I looked you up.

1093
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,180
Whose kid is that, really?

1094
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:23,100
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

1095
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,860
- Bobby Rayburn's.
- Jesus fuck.

1096
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:30,300
Same old fucking Gil. Come on.

1097
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,140
Really?

1098
01:27:00,421 --> 01:27:02,061
He'll be on in a minute.

1099
01:27:06,661 --> 01:27:08,861
You'll recognize his voice.

1100
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:14,821
All right, incoming call. Notify
incoming call. Turn off all radios.

1101
01:27:15,181 --> 01:27:16,541
Okay, this is it.

1102
01:27:18,061 --> 01:27:19,901
Bob.

1103
01:27:28,621 --> 01:27:31,221
- Yeah.
- Hey, Bobby, you still up?

1104
01:27:32,261 --> 01:27:34,581
- Bad time to be calling, huh?
- I'm up.

1105
01:27:34,861 --> 01:27:40,141
Hey, I hope I'm not calling at a bad time.
Probably got some people over, huh?

1106
01:27:40,621 --> 01:27:43,461
I can't hear you. You'll have to
turn the music down.

1107
01:27:43,781 --> 01:27:45,221
Oh, I'm sorry, slugger.

1108
01:27:45,701 --> 01:27:47,621
Curly, I want to talk to Sean.

1109
01:27:48,941 --> 01:27:53,741
Sean, he's asleep now, but he's doing
fine. Don't worry about him. He's fine.

1110
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:57,381
- Curly, what do you want?
- "I've been thinking it over."

1111
01:27:58,141 --> 01:28:01,301
You know, in life, life just...

1112
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:04,661
...comes down to one single action.

1113
01:28:06,901 --> 01:28:08,701
What do you want?

1114
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:11,581
I want you to hit a home run
for me, Bob.

1115
01:28:12,821 --> 01:28:14,461
Are you serious?

1116
01:28:14,661 --> 01:28:16,741
Remember that kid in chemo...

1117
01:28:17,341 --> 01:28:19,541
...whose life was unfair to him?

1118
01:28:20,501 --> 01:28:23,461
That's how I'm feeling.
My life has been unfair to me.

1119
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:30,181
The only difference is, I'll be able to see
you hit that home run tomorrow.

1120
01:28:30,461 --> 01:28:31,701
And I got a photo here.

1121
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:36,901
I'm gonna get it to you. And I want you
to put it on the Jumbotron, okay?

1122
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:43,701
- Yeah.
- Then I want you to stand up and tell...

1123
01:28:43,982 --> 01:28:45,422
...the 50 million viewers...

1124
01:28:45,622 --> 01:28:49,862
...that this home run
is dedicated to Gil, a true fan.

1125
01:28:52,902 --> 01:28:55,502
- What do you think?
- I can't believe you're serious.

1126
01:28:55,902 --> 01:28:58,302
I'm serious as a heart attack, Bobby.

1127
01:28:58,662 --> 01:29:00,582
That's pretty serious, isn't it?

1128
01:29:02,142 --> 01:29:06,142
There comes a time in everybody's life
when you have to stand for something.

1129
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:09,302
Otherwise, you're just
passing on through.

1130
01:29:09,622 --> 01:29:11,622
So, Bobby, I'm watching you.

1131
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:15,062
If that pitcher goes easy on you,
I'll kill your fucking kid.

1132
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:19,942
Surprise, surprise.

1133
01:29:20,622 --> 01:29:22,342
Hey, Bobby.

1134
01:29:23,422 --> 01:29:25,222
I'm still here.

1135
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:28,702
Now do you care?

1136
01:29:45,662 --> 01:29:48,062
You get in some serious shit for that.

1137
01:29:49,702 --> 01:29:51,782
Cops are gonna be all over us.

1138
01:29:53,702 --> 01:29:56,422
Boy, all of a sudden,
you lost your sense of humour.

1139
01:29:56,982 --> 01:29:59,262
- Did you get it?
- Couldn't get him.

1140
01:30:00,702 --> 01:30:04,742
He's calling from Rayburn's car. We
should be able to nail him to the district.

1141
01:30:11,182 --> 01:30:15,502
You're not gonna believe this kid.
Just like old times, huh, Coop?

1142
01:30:18,662 --> 01:30:21,902
- You know, that's not my real dad.
- It's okay, kid.

1143
01:30:28,142 --> 01:30:30,182
Come on, I'm waiting.

1144
01:30:30,822 --> 01:30:32,742
I'm waiting. The signals.

1145
01:30:33,142 --> 01:30:36,022
What happened? Did you forget
everything? Come on, Coop.

1146
01:30:52,423 --> 01:30:54,063
Hang in there, kid.

1147
01:30:56,263 --> 01:30:58,263
Bring the bat up, slugger.

1148
01:30:58,543 --> 01:31:01,703
Come on, look like a hitter.
Bring it up.

1149
01:31:02,183 --> 01:31:04,103
Bring it up. Come on.

1150
01:31:04,503 --> 01:31:08,223
Come on! Come on, slugger,
bring the fucking bat up.

1151
01:31:08,623 --> 01:31:10,343
Come on.

1152
01:31:11,303 --> 01:31:13,023
That's my boy.

1153
01:31:13,703 --> 01:31:16,983
It's all right, kid, hang in there, now.
Hang in there.

1154
01:31:27,143 --> 01:31:28,743
Coop, you dickhead!

1155
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:30,663
Come on, kid. Come on.

1156
01:31:32,783 --> 01:31:34,983
Go. Go. Up the fence. Come on.

1157
01:31:35,263 --> 01:31:36,703
Come on, push. Push. Go.

1158
01:31:37,383 --> 01:31:40,463
Go. Go on. Go, kid, go.

1159
01:31:41,983 --> 01:31:43,703
Coop, what are you doing?

1160
01:31:50,823 --> 01:31:53,303
Why did you do that?
We could've been teammates.

1161
01:31:54,263 --> 01:31:56,943
We were teammates.
We could've made it to the bigs.

1162
01:31:57,143 --> 01:31:59,343
It was Little League.
We were 12 years old.

1163
01:32:29,263 --> 01:32:30,903
Come on.

1164
01:32:36,583 --> 01:32:38,503
That's my boy.

1165
01:32:52,663 --> 01:32:55,663
Ladies and gentlemen,
leading off the second inning...

1166
01:32:55,944 --> 01:32:59,104
... Giants centre fielder, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

1167
01:33:00,744 --> 01:33:02,864
Well, the forecast is for rain tonight.

1168
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:05,904
There's a mist falling as Rayburn steps
towards the box.

1169
01:33:06,184 --> 01:33:09,064
He's been more aggressive
the last month of the season.

1170
01:33:09,464 --> 01:33:10,824
Who do we have on line two?

1171
01:33:10,984 --> 01:33:14,344
- Just a fan.
- Hey, Mr. Fan, how you doing?

1172
01:33:14,944 --> 01:33:17,624
Wanna say you're lucky to be
in the stadium tonight.

1173
01:33:17,904 --> 01:33:20,024
Really? Why's that?

1174
01:33:21,624 --> 01:33:24,504
- Is that a Giants watch I hear playing?
- Yes, it is.

1175
01:33:24,824 --> 01:33:27,584
- Is that my buddy Gil?
- Maybe.

1176
01:33:28,064 --> 01:33:31,224
This'll be one of the most amazing
nights in the game's history.

1177
01:33:32,784 --> 01:33:35,144
- "It'll be incredible."
- Really? Why's that, Gil?

1178
01:33:35,464 --> 01:33:37,664
I'm telling you,
the Kirk Gibson homer...

1179
01:33:37,864 --> 01:33:41,104
...Ripken breaking Gehrig's record,
peanuts compared to tonight.

1180
01:33:41,384 --> 01:33:44,264
You're talking about classic moments
in baseball history.

1181
01:33:44,544 --> 01:33:46,864
What's happening tonight
that could top those?

1182
01:33:47,144 --> 01:33:48,784
Let's just say Bobby Rayburn's...

1183
01:33:48,984 --> 01:33:51,064
- "... in for the night of his life."
- Why, Gil?

1184
01:33:51,464 --> 01:33:55,024
Well, some people are ungrateful.
They should be taught a lesson.

1185
01:33:56,744 --> 01:33:58,264
Strike!

1186
01:34:03,184 --> 01:34:05,184
Are you calling from
inside the stadium?

1187
01:34:05,464 --> 01:34:08,624
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- "Well..."

1188
01:34:09,304 --> 01:34:13,144
You got good seats? Are you behind
first base? Can you see me?

1189
01:34:13,544 --> 01:34:15,344
Can I see you?

1190
01:34:15,824 --> 01:34:19,104
Yeah, you're waving right at me.
Have a nice night.

1191
01:34:19,384 --> 01:34:22,544
Gil, wait. Before you hang up,
I wanted to ask you a question.

1192
01:34:22,944 --> 01:34:25,984
- Trying to trace the call, Jewel?
- What? What was that, Gil?

1193
01:34:26,264 --> 01:34:27,424
You'll never find me.

1194
01:34:29,944 --> 01:34:32,984
- Strike!
- Have a nice night.

1195
01:34:33,264 --> 01:34:35,584
Gil. Fuck!

1196
01:34:35,784 --> 01:34:37,704
Come on, man, go get him!

1197
01:34:38,544 --> 01:34:40,184
Play!

1198
01:34:41,824 --> 01:34:43,624
Yes!

1199
01:34:56,184 --> 01:34:57,464
Shit.

1200
01:34:58,104 --> 01:35:00,984
Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.

1201
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:03,625
- Did you feel that raindrop?
- What?

1202
01:35:03,905 --> 01:35:05,945
I felt rain.

1203
01:35:13,065 --> 01:35:16,425
- The guy's not gonna be crazy enough...
- He's here! The guy's here.

1204
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:19,785
- He could've been near a radio.
- He's in the stadium.

1205
01:35:22,265 --> 01:35:25,265
Look at that. That is one fine piece
of craftsmanship.

1206
01:35:25,425 --> 01:35:27,105
- What?
- The knife.

1207
01:35:27,265 --> 01:35:29,865
It's a first edition. See how it
says "prototype?

1208
01:35:30,025 --> 01:35:33,025
That means it's a collector's piece.

1209
01:35:33,185 --> 01:35:37,345
"Renard & Garrity." It's a local firm,
isn't it? Gilbert Renard?

1210
01:35:48,545 --> 01:35:50,785
What are you waiting for,
a clue, an invite?

1211
01:35:51,185 --> 01:35:55,025
This guy is gonna kill Bobby's kid
if you don't find him in nine innings.

1212
01:35:55,505 --> 01:35:58,945
Ladies and gentlemen, leading off
the bottom of the eighth...

1213
01:35:59,185 --> 01:36:01,505
... number 33, Bobby Rayburn.

1214
01:36:01,745 --> 01:36:05,745
Bobby's as safe as Kennedy was
in Dallas. What are you looking for?

1215
01:36:06,945 --> 01:36:08,785
Play!

1216
01:36:23,705 --> 01:36:25,305
Ball one.

1217
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:29,145
- What, are you walking me?
- Consider it a compliment, dickhead.

1218
01:36:29,825 --> 01:36:32,425
Fuck! Do you know what you're
doing to me?!

1219
01:36:32,785 --> 01:36:35,305
- They're giving him first base.
- Throw the pitch!

1220
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:37,305
Fuck!

1221
01:36:45,465 --> 01:36:46,905
Fuck.

1222
01:36:47,185 --> 01:36:49,865
Oh, man, the ump's gonna
call the game. Oh, my... Fuck.

1223
01:36:51,225 --> 01:36:53,705
Oh, God, please don't do this.
I'm begging you.

1224
01:36:54,105 --> 01:36:55,545
Don't... Throw the pitch.

1225
01:36:55,705 --> 01:36:58,025
For God's sake, listen to me!
Throw the pitch!

1226
01:36:58,305 --> 01:37:00,425
Throw the fucking pitch!

1227
01:37:01,465 --> 01:37:04,745
- Do you know what you're doing to me?
- "The umpire has decided..."

1228
01:37:04,945 --> 01:37:07,145
... to send both teams
into the dugouts.

1229
01:37:07,426 --> 01:37:09,546
It looks like we've got a rain delay.

1230
01:37:12,306 --> 01:37:15,866
Ladies and gentlemen, the umpire
has called for a rain delay...

1231
01:37:16,146 --> 01:37:20,386
... with the Padres
leading the Giants 2 to 1.

1232
01:37:26,706 --> 01:37:30,346
Do you and your dad have a special
place he and you like to go?

1233
01:37:31,306 --> 01:37:33,506
Stadium in the Sky's
our Little League park.

1234
01:37:33,986 --> 01:37:36,786
My dad used to play there
when he was a kid.

1235
01:37:38,306 --> 01:37:40,306
Is my daddy in trouble?

1236
01:37:58,546 --> 01:37:59,786
Ladies and gentlemen...

1237
01:37:59,986 --> 01:38:03,546
... we resume play with the Giants
batting in the bottom of the eighth.

1238
01:38:04,306 --> 01:38:08,026
Proceed to Little League park
Stadium in the Sky, 24th and Sanchez.

1239
01:38:08,426 --> 01:38:10,426
We pick it up in the eighth inning...

1240
01:38:10,706 --> 01:38:12,746
...on what might be Rayburn's
last at-bat.

1241
01:38:13,026 --> 01:38:14,666
They'll play on this wet field.

1242
01:38:14,946 --> 01:38:18,186
The cold night air is getting
to everybody. Look at Rayburn.

1243
01:38:18,506 --> 01:38:21,466
He's going to the mound to have
a chat with Martinez.

1244
01:38:23,186 --> 01:38:26,146
- Oh, shit.
- I don't give a fuck what he tells you.

1245
01:38:26,546 --> 01:38:29,506
Throw the ball over the plate,
or I'll break your head in.

1246
01:38:29,786 --> 01:38:31,546
- Fuck you.
- You hear me?

1247
01:38:33,466 --> 01:38:36,706
This may go back to when Martinez
pitched for Pittsburgh.

1248
01:38:37,266 --> 01:38:40,066
He drilled Rayburn in his back
with a fastball.

1249
01:38:40,266 --> 01:38:42,186
We are seeing it all tonight, Rick.

1250
01:38:44,666 --> 01:38:48,226
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- First pitch is at your head, buddy.

1251
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,226
Come on, man, do this! Do this!

1252
01:38:55,986 --> 01:38:59,826
A critical at-bat for Rayburn,
the $40 million San Francisco Giant.

1253
01:39:00,186 --> 01:39:02,586
Probably his last chance
to get the Giants even.

1254
01:39:02,986 --> 01:39:06,626
Here in the bottom of the eighth,
the Giants trail 2 to 1.

1255
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:13,746
- "Swung on. Strik e one."
- Strike!

1256
01:39:16,227 --> 01:39:18,907
All right, come on! Come on, Bobby!

1257
01:39:35,867 --> 01:39:38,867
Swung on and missed. Strik e two.
Rayburn in the hole.

1258
01:39:39,147 --> 01:39:43,067
One strike left
for Bobby Rayburn tonight.

1259
01:39:43,467 --> 01:39:45,667
Jesus Christ, man.

1260
01:39:51,987 --> 01:39:55,547
Air Seven copy. Proceeding
to Stadium in the Sky. Over.

1261
01:39:57,347 --> 01:39:59,867
- Man.
- They're gonna call the game.

1262
01:40:00,147 --> 01:40:02,347
They're gonna call this fucking game.

1263
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:30,067
Two and two. Two balls, two strik es.

1264
01:40:30,347 --> 01:40:33,507
And Rayburn down to his last strik e.

1265
01:40:34,467 --> 01:40:36,867
Bobby knows he's had
two pitches to drive there.

1266
01:40:37,147 --> 01:40:40,147
Now at 2-2, you're not gonna
get another good pitch to hit.

1267
01:40:40,427 --> 01:40:43,667
Maybe, since it's damp, he's having
trouble holding the ball.

1268
01:40:44,067 --> 01:40:46,067
This game could be called
at any second.

1269
01:41:04,027 --> 01:41:06,427
Play ball!

1270
01:41:15,067 --> 01:41:17,627
San Diego protecting
its one-run lead.

1271
01:41:17,827 --> 01:41:20,507
Martinez readies, steadies
and delivers to...

1272
01:41:20,788 --> 01:41:23,028
Rayburn drives it deep
to right centre field!

1273
01:41:23,668 --> 01:41:25,228
- Yes!
- Yes! Go!

1274
01:41:30,188 --> 01:41:31,548
- Run!
- Home run!

1275
01:41:31,828 --> 01:41:35,188
It's off the wall. Rayburn could get
three if he hustles.

1276
01:41:35,468 --> 01:41:38,548
Robinson having trouble
just getting to the ball.

1277
01:41:38,828 --> 01:41:41,628
Rayburn, rounding second,
headed for third.

1278
01:41:41,788 --> 01:41:45,628
He ran through the stop sign. It could
be an inside-the-park home run!

1279
01:41:45,948 --> 01:41:49,868
The relay from Park er!
Rayburn slides, headfirst!

1280
01:41:50,228 --> 01:41:51,588
And he is...

1281
01:41:51,868 --> 01:41:53,028
... in there!

1282
01:41:53,788 --> 01:41:54,868
Yes!

1283
01:41:55,148 --> 01:41:56,388
You're out!

1284
01:41:56,748 --> 01:41:58,988
What is that?

1285
01:41:59,468 --> 01:42:00,708
Bad fucking call, man!

1286
01:42:01,188 --> 01:42:03,668
- You're out! Sit down!
- No, no, no.

1287
01:42:04,068 --> 01:42:05,788
I beat it by a fucking mile!

1288
01:42:05,988 --> 01:42:10,468
You're out. You're questioning my call?
Sit down! You're out! Sit down!

1289
01:42:15,268 --> 01:42:18,068
You're the fucking guy!
He's the fucking guy!

1290
01:42:20,268 --> 01:42:21,508
It's the umpire!

1291
01:42:43,108 --> 01:42:44,908
What the fuck is that?

1292
01:42:45,948 --> 01:42:47,708
This way! Break it open!

1293
01:42:49,988 --> 01:42:53,348
- Shit.
- What the hell's going on?

1294
01:42:58,028 --> 01:43:01,588
Okay, okay. I just want my kid back.

1295
01:43:01,948 --> 01:43:04,948
Batter up, Bobby.
I waited a long time for this.

1296
01:43:05,988 --> 01:43:09,068
No, no, no, wait. No. Okay, look.

1297
01:43:10,228 --> 01:43:13,068
- Where's Sean?
- Where do you think he is?

1298
01:43:13,468 --> 01:43:15,588
Come on, where is my son?

1299
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:19,028
Where's...? Bobby,
where's my home run?

1300
01:43:19,428 --> 01:43:22,948
What?! Curly. Curly.
Where's my son?!

1301
01:43:24,308 --> 01:43:26,708
Where is he? I don't know.

1302
01:43:27,949 --> 01:43:30,069
I guess he's in that big stadium
in the sky.

1303
01:43:30,749 --> 01:43:33,429
I'm telling you, Curly,
if you hurt my fucking kid...

1304
01:43:33,709 --> 01:43:39,469
...I swear to God I'll kill you!
- Bobby. Bobby. Be nice, Bob.

1305
01:43:42,429 --> 01:43:44,429
What do you want from me?

1306
01:43:47,629 --> 01:43:50,869
I don't want anything.
I just want you to...

1307
01:43:54,989 --> 01:43:58,269
- I never showed you my best pitch.
- Curly!

1308
01:44:15,229 --> 01:44:17,149
Curly!

1309
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:22,829
Freeze!

1310
01:44:28,749 --> 01:44:31,269
No, no, don't shoot! He's got my son.

1311
01:44:32,309 --> 01:44:33,549
Now do you care?

1312
01:44:35,669 --> 01:44:37,669
Bobby, now do you care?

1313
01:44:40,069 --> 01:44:41,989
Just a little bit?

1314
01:44:47,069 --> 01:44:48,789
Curly, don't!

1315
01:45:12,469 --> 01:45:14,229
Curly, where's my son?

1316
01:45:15,269 --> 01:45:18,829
Where's Sean, Curly?
Where's my son?

1317
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:22,749
A simple "thank you"
would have been nice.

1318
01:45:23,989 --> 01:45:25,549
Where's my son?

1319
01:45:27,349 --> 01:45:29,749
Curly, where's my son?!

1320
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:38,110
There she is,
site of the old stadium.

1321
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:45,470
Sean!

1322
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:49,030
Sean!

1323
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:56,990
Sean!

1324
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:03,910
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1325
01:46:04,070 --> 01:46:06,390
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Dad.

1326
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:09,750
I got him!

1327
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:27,870
What you are seeing here
is a sad turn of events indeed.

1328
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:30,270
Gil Renard, an unemployed
knife salesman...

1329
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:33,430
... was shot to death by the police
during tonight's game.

1330
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:36,590
Here's how it happened.
Bobby Rayburn...
