Paolo

00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,585
Paolo

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,823
Paolo, are you there?

5
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:09,612
Oh Paolo, of course I love you.

7
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:34,373
Dear Marikla,

8
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:37,412
I'm writing to you
because I need your advise.

9
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:40,548
I am 24 years old and I am married
for 5 years.

10
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,518
Pretty, I've been told
and nice to be around.

11
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,987
I have a good job
and a wonderful husband.

12
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:50,358
I know I married a bit young
but everything is going very well.

13
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,660
A passionate relationship in the beginning,

14
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:55,951
and then much later
complicity.

15
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:09,978
But for some time,

16
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,681
I feel something strange.
It's hard to explain.

17
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:18,710
I want to have fun,
to live more intensely.

18
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:23,535
I feel that nothing interesting
happens.

19
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:26,427
I say it's the season

20
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:28,563
which brings out in me
these strange desires.

21
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:33,508
They become stronger,
more urgent every day.

22
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,972
Especially since that night
my sister Nadia took us to a party.

23
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:43,603
in honora Venetian poetess.

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,615
I'd penetrate you
without touching you.

25
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:49,851
And my tongue wanders

26
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:52,487
wanders casually
in the fleece of your ass.

27
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:56,324
I would like to offer your mouth
my honey flavor.

28
00:02:56,325 --> 00:03:00,659
I would lock you
between my breasts generous

29
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,596
and down between your balls

30
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,463
and suck your cock whole.

31
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:07,969
And that fits your body
the accents of my body.

32
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,905
And back to your belly
to your heart.

33
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:17,311
And to find the rest
I would like

34
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:22,510
not knowing enjoying.

35
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,585
Bravo!

36
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,452
Wonderful!

37
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,353
Eccentric!

38
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:30,391
- Modern!
- Bravo!

39
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,894
As the best of Veronica Franco
and Patricia Valduga,

40
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:36,383
An exploration
of female sensuality.

41
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:48,910
It was sublime,
your book will be a smash!

42
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:52,013
I am Nadia Valentini,
I run a body-fitness gym.

43
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:54,414
Come check it out.

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,418
Nadia Valentini...

45
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,942
- I'd love to be able to write like you.
- Ah.

46
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:13,732
Your heart line is perfect,
it's rare.

47
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,980
Shall we dance?

48
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,783
Well, certainly!

49
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,830
I am an intruder,

50
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,431
I have no invitation.

51
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:46,534
I'm not invited
Neither do I.

52
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:49,436
I accompany the poetess.

53
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:52,166
In Venice, we are neighbors.

54
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,574
Venice is unique.

55
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:58,672
A French poet said:

56
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:02,376
<i>Venise, sexe femelle d'Europe</i>.

57
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,727
You are a sailor,
to have these tattoos?

58
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:15,526
I travel a lot.

59
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:18,532
I get the old stuff.

60
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:22,603
You could get the two old
sitting there!

61
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:23,905
This type interests you?

62
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,204
This is my husband!

63
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:28,543
A husband does not count!

64
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:31,809
For me, it is important.

65
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:38,819
I would like to enter,
without touching you.

66
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:46,657
My tongue wanders
wanders casually

67
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:51,927
on the fleece of your ass.

68
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:55,129
I'm sure you're wet.

69
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:59,671
Excuse me.
My head is spinning.

70
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,856
No need to go
in museums, idiots!

71
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:16,557
The art now is everywhere.
We are art!

72
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:18,426
Two examples of Baroque art.

73
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,395
With beautiful curves
generous!

74
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,929
It brings back to life.

75
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,991
Aside, here are two beautiful brows,
in pure rococo style.

76
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:32,838
But ...

77
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:34,308
Shhh. Do not be afraid of me.

78
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,878
I am afraid of nothing,
I do not know your name.

79
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,847
<i>Ah, très juste.
Alphonse Donatien.</i>

80
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,679
<i>Pirate d'amour</i>

81
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:12,703
I guess you are wet?

82
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:21,252
What are you doing?

83
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:24,383
I'm doing everything I promised to do.

84
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,877
Diana, are you there?

85
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:53,682
Yes, Paolo. Just a minute!

86
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,638
I hadn't seen you for a while.
Anything wrong?

87
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,541
Of course not, I just had to pee.
Do you want to leave, darling?

88
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:15,874
Yeah, I'm bored silly.
This party's shit.

89
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,878
As you like. Let's go.

90
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:32,500
You're soaked!

91
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,463
And it's not pee!.

92
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,899
What makes you
such an effect?

93
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,434
Well, if you touch me there,
of course I get wet.

94
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:43,271
You know how sensitive I am.

95
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,796
Do it some more..

96
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:52,446
Was it that guy or me
who brought it out in you?

97
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:55,716
- What guy?
- Your partner, you were dancing with!

98
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:59,585
Oh. He's French.
He has a home in Venice, he said.

99
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:02,946
It made me salacious proposals.

100
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,925
Oh, Paolo you're driving me crazy.

101
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,329
It was a little old, right?

102
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,321
No, not at all!

103
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,266
You should have called me.

104
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:14,368
It would have been an admission
of adultery.

105
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,370
I was in the toilet with him.

106
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,973
- The bastard!
- You did not realized.

107
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:21,306
He was behind the door.

108
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,679
Ah, you're kidding! It's just
another one of your silly stories!

109
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,781
- He had me naked in no time.
- Enough!

110
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:31,352
He wanted to take me by the ass
and if you had not happened ...

111
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,521
You're inventing everything.
I know it! I'm no idiot!

112
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:36,616
He thought my ass was beautiful.

113
00:09:38,694 --> 00:09:41,529
How was? How was his thing?
You touched?

114
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,830
It was as hard as that?

115
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:57,044
You like my ass, Paolo, don't you?

116
00:09:57,045 --> 00:10:00,073
How many times do I have to tell
you? It's the most gorgeous.

117
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:07,945
You can't give an opinion unless you..
unless you look at it first!

118
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,893
Tell me I have a beautiful ass!

119
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,564
It is beautiful, gorgeous...

120
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:19,862
Oh, God!

121
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,484
- We get home, quick!
- No, Let's do that here!

122
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,038
Hurry up!

123
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,685
Tell me, tell me you made it all up!

124
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:38,983
Oh, tell me!

125
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:41,385
Shut up!

126
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,931
And they call us whores, huh!

127
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,074
You're right!

128
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,505
<i>Bonjour!</i>

129
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:16,724
Okay now, lazy-bone, rise and shine!

130
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,989
I'll teach you some good manners!

131
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,355
You're hurting me, stop!

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,102
What are you doing?

133
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:31,571
I rape you!
I rape you!

134
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,233
It's 8 o'clock!
You rape me later.

135
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,007
Let me go!

136
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,561
If mother could see the chaos
you make me live in!

137
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:55,621
Which witch?

138
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:56,789
Sorry!

139
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:59,366
You're not to speak
about my mother like that!

140
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:03,963
All right, Mr.
the grumbling, I am silent!

141
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:21,539
It's the little musical
Aquatic Mozart.

142
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,649
That's complete amorality!

143
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,274
And you. Pig!

144
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,299
That son of a bitch
dribbled right up the middle!

145
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:04,933
You kidding?
That shit head's nowhere!

146
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,858
He couldn't find the hole in that hoop
if they stuffed his face inside it!

147
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,496
The boy's got great hands!

148
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:13,253
You know what Hal Taylor would do?
That turkey?

149
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:15,815
That so-called turkey
is a great clutch player!

150
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,094
Is that what you call a center?

151
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,724
He's the greatest center playing
in the league right now.

152
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:21,981
I'm out of patience with assholes 
like you. Don't give me that shit.

153
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,052
who wouldn't know a point guard from pivot!
Your guys need a crooked umpire to win!

154
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,915
You ever seen a basketball game?

155
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,812
You let go of me, goddam it?

156
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,170
Let go of what? Jesus Christ, a fag!

157
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:30,803
I've been standing here
talking to a fag all this time!

158
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:32,060
You're the one who grabbed my cock! Now I
know why you like that Taylor kid so much.

159
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,876
You're just lucky,
this is my stop coming up!

160
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:38,123
Or what, you would've kissed me?

161
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:12,125
Miss, take my seat.
Thanks, no, my stop is coming up.

162
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,944
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:36,363
Hey, listen! You gotta get
a couple of things clear.

164
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,389
Get the mud out of your upstairs!

165
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:38,132
I can see it's hard on you.

166
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,105
That little thing
might just ruin your vocation!

167
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,992
Miss ...

168
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:45,832
Take my advice, kid.
Go confess all!

169
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,524
How about a phone call?

170
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,208
Do you know my number?

171
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,075
- No
- You're outta luck, boy!

172
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,775
Bye!

173
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,461
Hi Lello!

174
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:15,561
You're crying, what's the matter?

175
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:17,331
He left me!
He's gone back to his wife!

176
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:19,833
She said she was sick

177
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,368
and that it was his fault.

178
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:22,970
- And it's true?
- I do not know,

179
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:26,373
but maybe it does.
There are millions of men,

180
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:27,574
Why do this to me?

181
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:28,906
Going out tonight

182
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,412
and you will find full
that are better.

183
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:35,299
- You really think so?
- Guarantee!

184
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:41,021
Hey, your diet! Antonietta?

185
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:46,894
Like the lady said, everything I like is
either illegal, immoral, or fattening!

186
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:51,397
- Really
- Look! I've got a terrific surprise for you!

187
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,501
It reminded me
memorable nights with Peter.

188
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:55,502
Is there a new way in it, huh?

189
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:56,834
The 'Atom Bomb', just try it!

190
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,472
You're just dying
to take it home with you, Lello!

191
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,315
I bought six like it yesterday,
only a much better quality!

192
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:11,364
The least you could do,
is to make them.

193
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,365
Hello, kids, hard at work? That's fine!

194
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:26,165
Hi, Mr. Silvio.

195
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,469
Antonietta, I just got
new models.

196
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,500
Would you mind very much
modeling a few in the South Wing?

197
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:35,408
It's very nice of you!

198
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:37,445
Come along, my dear.

199
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:42,712
Some girls have all the luck, huh!

200
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:48,415
The rest of you can take a break!

201
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,603
let me see your breasts!

202
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:11,209
Now bend this leg a little.

203
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,512
And turn around now.

204
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:26,086
Pull your panties up
tight between the cheeks.

205
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:32,659
Oh, just my size!

206
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:35,869
This morning I woke up
with a third leg like a telephone pole,

207
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,829
and I thought of you right away!

208
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:42,409
I'm flattered,
Mr. Silvio.

209
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,567
Hello!

210
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,571
- Hello, Diana.
- Hello, Mrs. Tommasini

211
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:11,772
You seem to be dressed
in mourning, though.

212
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:14,575
Yes, I just lost
my little Danny.

213
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:17,411
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Somebody very close?

214
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:20,380
Yes, we were together for
years.

215
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,771
He was a wonderful Labrador.

216
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:23,654
Oh, I imagine.

217
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,419
And how's your husband the Senator?

218
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,955
In France, eating foie gras
and fighting hunger in the world.

219
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:30,257
Have you prepared
the items I ordered?

220
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:31,748
Of course.

221
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:35,052
I can't wait to fill up my drawers.

222
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:42,503
I'll try those.
These are the same as last Thursday.

223
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:45,205
I always put these,
They fit me well.

224
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:46,874
You should have seen the former,
they were in pieces!

225
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,176
That engineer has tastes of his own.

226
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:51,712
An engineer?
Your newest conquest, huh?

227
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,548
No, but one of the most generous.
Cartier!

228
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:57,518
Congratulations!

229
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,620
At least
I never get bored in the afternoon.

230
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,622
I've found a little group of friends.

231
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,224
I was introduced by Alicia.
She's a client of yours?

232
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,556
Mrs. Farconi?

233
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,327
Alicia, yes, I see,
Mrs. Dow.

234
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:11,082
She is attending
that people in high places.

235
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:13,667
It brings in a lot,
I could tell him about you.

236
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:17,627
It's kind of you,
thank you.

237
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,441
I'm still undecided ...
To make a whore?

238
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:24,011
I'm not really a pro. Fills in spare time!
And plenty of ladies do it.

239
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:27,848
Anyway, real whores never come.
I do, like an avalanche!

240
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:30,517
Oh, men have great imaginations!

241
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:33,020
I learn something
at each meeting.

242
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:35,455
And it does not interest you?

243
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,824
My husband has enough imagination.

244
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:38,959
Oh, mine doesn't!

245
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,428
How inventive can
an envoy to the European Parliament be?

246
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:44,398
Oh, but it's so romantic
to meet someone unknown,

247
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:46,233
in a hotel room, or apartment.

248
00:19:46,234 --> 00:19:48,368
Your heart beats like crazy.
It's adventure,

249
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:49,736
How wonderful!

250
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:52,005
And this feeling
being for sale,

251
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:54,441
with all the shame and sin.

252
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,840
I'd give it a whirl, if I were you!

253
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:59,244
I must say I really think
I'll pass on your..

254
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:01,582
I know a Chilean archbishop
you would love.

255
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,517
Priests does not really excite me.

256
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,751
These are the best customers,
believe me.

257
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:06,019
I take those.

258
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,647
All right.

259
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,294
Ms. Tomasini is really nice.

260
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:17,030
She's a big success in what she does,

261
00:20:17,031 --> 00:20:19,429
which is actually something like what I do,
if you want to know the truth.

262
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,268
In there getting poked, yes.

263
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:24,338
My precious favors
in return for a raise in pay.

264
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:26,473
My husband isn't sorry,
and neither am I!

265
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:29,341
How? He knows?

266
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,078
No guilt about it, for Pierre?

267
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,680
This is not a marriage
love, and he knows it.

268
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:35,649
You still betrayed
your husband, right?

269
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,352
I do not see at all
things like you.

270
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:39,653
Come on, do not tell me
stories!

271
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,288
It is difficult to define.

272
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:44,491
With Pierre, I have
tenderness and little else.

273
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:46,793
With others,
only for the trifle.

274
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:48,295
See you soon, Diana.

275
00:20:48,296 --> 00:20:50,864
If you change your mind,
give me a call.

276
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:53,495
Okay, I'll keep it in mind, thanks.

277
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,908
I do not know how you can
sleep with the boss.

278
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:04,044
It's really big.

279
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:07,347
It does not bother me,
I do not care completely.

280
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:09,407
And then the ugly

281
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,318
are more generous
the handsome guys.

282
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:14,021
And ugly guys have more time
to dedicate ourselves.

283
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,623
- Maybe ...
- Some call it the defect.

284
00:21:16,624 --> 00:21:19,493
It's just fun.
When I fuck the boss

285
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,295
I'm just a good time.
That's it!

286
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:24,288
A little sex is good!

287
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,769
- What if you fell pregnant?
- No danger of that happening to me!

288
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,471
I use the only real
natural method.

289
00:21:31,472 --> 00:21:33,906
Just take it here!

290
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:38,644
Diana! My God.
Are you all right?

291
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:43,748
Huh? I'm alright. I'm okay.

292
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:48,314
Diana? Would you mind
coming to the workroom?

293
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:50,414
There's someone here to see you.

294
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:52,955
Yes ... yes, thank you.
I'm coming.

295
00:22:04,639 --> 00:22:07,507
Nadia? What are you doing here?
A little tact, Nadia!

296
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:11,244
Aunt Emma just kicked the bucket.
My God, she did not do that?

297
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,447
Fortunately I had
asked to be tactful.

298
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:16,850
I can not leave the club,
it is you who will go to the funeral.

299
00:22:16,851 --> 00:22:19,252
You were his favorite,
we all know!

300
00:22:19,253 --> 00:22:22,055
But I do not know ...
I'm afraid of ...

301
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:24,650
I have work!

302
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:30,459
Do not worry about it.
Go to Venice.

303
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:33,363
Do not worry about Paolo.

304
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:36,792
I'll take care of him,

305
00:22:43,277 --> 00:22:44,744
I promise.

306
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:48,566
Sorry, dear,
I wish I accompany you,

307
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:50,951
Do not worry, I'm great,
I know on my own.

308
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,588
I am concerned about your faithfulness.
You know that the funeral is sexy.

309
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,823
Paolo, stop! You're crazy!

310
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:58,892
It is an established historical fact:

311
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:01,561
creates a funeral
a funereal atmosphere that makes

312
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,430
a sense favorable
to love.

313
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,932
I read in an article
on adultery.

314
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:12,331
Statistics show that more
60% of Italian women cheat their husbands.

315
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,710
- What is that?
- Antonietta gave it to me!

316
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,879
But it is that these people
with whom you work?

317
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,947
People who are not ashamed
what they do,

318
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:23,650
bourgeois and not stuck like you.
And if you looked?

319
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:26,279
If you insist ...

320
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:47,574
<i>Come in, please.
This gentleman is with you?</i>

321
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:48,909
<i>This is my husband.</i>

322
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,844
<i>Wait for me, honey.</i>

323
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:55,613
Ah yes, it's nice.

324
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:58,378
Yes, like that.

325
00:23:58,486 --> 00:24:01,978
Below ...
To the right.

326
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:14,799
<i>Take off your clothes.</i>

327
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:25,310
You're almost there!

328
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:27,438
<i>Sit down there.</i>

329
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:34,487
<i>Spread well.</i>

330
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:36,489
What do you think?

331
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:41,107
When you go to the ...
the gynecologist, is it ...

332
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:42,929
Him?

333
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,664
He has at least 70 years!

334
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:46,766
Guess he is young.

335
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,962
Well, it depends ...

336
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:56,243
You'd be upset
if I did?

337
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,444
I would be very angry!

338
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,450
And that's all
it would cause such reaction?

339
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:05,552
I would be very angry!

340
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:08,655
These things happen
all the time at the store.

341
00:25:08,656 --> 00:25:12,859
This is our boss, a real sick!
He puts his hands almost everywhere.

342
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,228
Where does he touch you?

343
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:18,231
Everywhere!
On my breasts, my ass.

344
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:21,401
He stroked my ass
presenting his condolences.

345
00:25:21,402 --> 00:25:24,271
How old bastard!
But you, what do you say?

346
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,973
Nothing! I bet you did not say anything.
Go! Tell me!

347
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:31,845
I wanted to digress.
But I was stuck in the back room.

348
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:33,813
Yeah?
What did he do to you?

349
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:37,375
He opened my legs.

350
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:40,353
- He touched me right on the button.
- Like that?

351
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:42,288
Yes, like that!

352
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:46,493
- What's Next?
- Then he turned me around

353
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:48,894
and made me bend forward.

354
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:01,474
Oh, dear, a little higher!

355
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:03,306
Higher up, darling, higher up! Please!

356
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:05,712
I can't take it!
It's your fault, you little sow!

357
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:10,095
That imagination of yours
excites me too much!

358
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:24,483
Gentlemen, can you do me a favor?

359
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,494
- Certainly!
- What do we have to do?

360
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:30,964
I want to be paid
1 million lire.

361
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,489
Why?

362
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:34,368
Give my virginity ...

363
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,994
that of my ass.

364
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,507
Giving money to a woman? Never.

365
00:27:40,508 --> 00:27:45,452
I may be romantic,
but ass fucking a woman, no.

366
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:16,497
How dare you!
I am mourning.

367
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:29,856
Subject to clause
that binding

368
00:28:29,857 --> 00:28:31,958
it will not be added
to those existing parts.

369
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,394
I bequeath to Marco Valentini,
son of my brother Luigi Valentini

370
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:38,297
and therefore my legitimate nephew,

371
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:41,425
the property of Villa di Mira

372
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:44,838
It was a plague, I'm sorry
for giving her the red dress!

373
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,272
She jokes?

374
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:49,709
It'll cost us more
to restore!

375
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,246
And similarly,
I leave also to Diana Bruni

376
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:55,949
daughter of the deceased
Giovanna Valentini,

377
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,452
the property that is
in the upper floor of a building

378
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:03,549
located at 1725 Via Tideca.

379
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:05,825
I bequeath also objects
and furniture that are therein

380
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:08,920
at the time of my death.

381
00:29:09,196 --> 00:29:12,465
You're really lucky!
That's exactly what I wanted!

382
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:14,367
I needed
a pied-à-terre in Venice!

383
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,836
I give in this

384
00:29:16,937 --> 00:29:20,240
my other properties
with what they contain,

385
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,509
and my bank account,
cash and securities,

386
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,845
to the convent of the Carmelites
Via Veneto

387
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:29,549
I helped convent
throughout my life.

388
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,658
Your signatures.

389
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:35,851
What a piece of ass!

390
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:39,728
You look great!

391
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:42,862
The air in Rome! Thanks.

392
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:45,498
I'm going to take a look at the penthouse.
Do you want to see it?

393
00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:48,635
Impossible, Marco.
We have company for dinner tonight.

394
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:51,466
Don't worry about a thing, Nora.
Go on back to Padova.

395
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:56,442
I'll go along with Diana
and I'll be home in time for dinner.

396
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:59,403
Once again, please.

397
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,650
Father, you must sign.
The last shall be first!

398
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:07,420
I'm glad you came along with me.
Strange lady, aunt Emma.

399
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:10,323
She liked us a lot, you and me.
Actually, of all the relatives,

400
00:30:10,324 --> 00:30:11,991
I'm the one
that spent the least time with her

401
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:13,793
But you knew about her?

402
00:30:13,794 --> 00:30:15,895
Well sure. At least
the things the family said.

403
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:18,631
Discreet, organized, intelligent-
above all, skillful!

404
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:21,401
Skillful? In what sense?

405
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:25,038
In love! Two or three lovers
same time, and even four!

406
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,189
Rich people,
with good social position.

407
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:31,711
They helped her make a fortune.

408
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:35,481
Thanks to them
she has learned to manage property.

409
00:30:35,482 --> 00:30:37,016
For his interest
and ours today.

410
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:39,485
How about uncle Harry?

411
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:41,317
A mystery, did he know
about her infidelities or didn't?

412
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,056
IDid he like it or was it killing him?

413
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:47,026
Well, I still think he was
really never interested in women.

414
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:50,530
But one thing's for sure,
Emma was always loyal over him.

415
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:55,807
And if he were alive today,
we would not have inherited.

416
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:03,943
Do not be afraid.
No one will take your apartment.

417
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:06,346
It is yours, you can do
what you want.

418
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:10,829
Perhaps will you come to Venice
a little more often?

419
00:31:11,051 --> 00:31:13,281
No doubt.

420
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:16,022
- And how's it going with Nora?
- How about with you and Paolo?

421
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:18,791
- Marvellous!
- Does he know about us?

422
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:21,527
Know what, Marco?
That I had you before him,

423
00:31:21,528 --> 00:31:23,963
And you and I in bed,
did everything you can do.

424
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:25,795
Everything? My dear.

425
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,630
I have some bad news for you!

426
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,230
Come on, hurry up.

427
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:33,973
I feel like going up to the tip
of the Dogana. Do you remember?

428
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,966
How could I forget?

429
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:03,002
You make me crazy!
I want more!

430
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:07,840
- I used to call you the erector set
- You used to say my erector set.

431
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:09,744
There's still the same stink
of pee here as always.

432
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:11,567
I bet with all the tourists,
even the ladies take a leak.

433
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:15,615
Open your legs. Not like that.

434
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,583
You were more enterprising.

435
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:21,338
You just forgot how
was standing.

436
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:26,145
- For heaven's sake.
- Yes ... I know.

437
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,536
What are you doing?
You will not leave me like that?

438
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,839
Let's go to my house. We can do it
in style and comfort there.

439
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,775
- Ah, you mean aunt Emma's penthouse!
- This house is mine.

440
00:32:42,776 --> 00:32:45,945
I decided not to return to Rome
and stay until tomorrow.

441
00:32:45,946 --> 00:32:49,682
I want to spend my first night
in my house.

442
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:53,312
Yeah, but I've got to get back home,
we have these guests coming for dinner.

443
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,242
Ah, as far as that goes,
I told Paolo that I'd return tonight.

444
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,458
No, Diana.
I simply can't do it. I can't.

445
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,237
No sweat, we'll make it
for some other time.

446
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:15,274
I'm going to make good use
of my house in Venice, yeah!

447
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:17,777
Marco, that's the ferry-boat
for the station.

448
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,812
If you run, you can catch it!

449
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:23,865
I want you to make me
visit this home.

450
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:27,520
I promise!
But must you hurry!

451
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:29,853
Faster!

452
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:31,925
Bye!

453
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:33,755
Bye!

454
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:57,718
My God!

455
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:00,259
Who would have expected this?

456
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,422
You should not get bored ...

457
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:21,955
Well, it's sure to have cost you
a lot of blow-jobs this penthouse!

458
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:26,875
My dear aunt,
you are amazing!

459
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:31,981
I love you more with every snapshot!

460
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:19,162
I did promise Paolo I'd call.
Wonder if the phone works?

461
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:40,924
Donatien ...'' Alphonse.''

462
00:39:51,638 --> 00:39:52,935
Allo!

463
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,876
Morning, could I please speak
with uh! Alphonse Donatien?

464
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:58,845
<i>C'est moi.</i>

465
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:02,882
Ah, you might not recall.
Diana Bruni, you and I met..

466
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:05,918
at someone's house in Rome
at the party to meet the poetess?

467
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:07,489
<i>Ah, oui</i>, the lovely lady
I struck up a conversation with.

468
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:10,425
Where are you calling from?

469
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,826
Oh, Venice, I was left a small apartment
that I like to redecorate it.

470
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:18,831
- And that is why you thought of me?
- Partly, after all, you said..

471
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,534
I'm delighted you did!
Let's talk about it, come on over!

472
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:26,700
Come on over? Where?

473
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:28,808
To my place, right now!
Palazzo Lorenzoni. It's easy to find.

474
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:30,976
I know Venice
I know where it is.

475
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:34,037
- Then hurry up, please!
- I'll be seeing you!

476
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,912
It's cold!

477
00:41:57,477 --> 00:41:59,387
<i>Voila!</i>

478
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:01,098
Good evening.

479
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,608
Good evening.

480
00:43:05,714 --> 00:43:07,455
Hello, uh, haven't we
already met some where?

481
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,628
Fresh, light, without a guide.

482
00:43:08,735 --> 00:43:11,795
The mouth has its own sex.

483
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:16,121
Swellings which meet
in the same party.

484
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:20,933
This is more than strange. It's...

485
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:25,581
Go on in.
Alphonse is waiting for you.

486
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,346
<i>Bonsoir!</l>

487
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:57,349
You found the place
with very little effort, huh?

488
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:59,482
Sure!

489
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:03,856
You were with that poetess?

490
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:06,951
Oh, oui. Just work!

491
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,752
At this hour of the night?

492
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:13,560
Et toi, didn't you come here for that?

493
00:44:16,836 --> 00:44:20,738
Ever since that night
it's been like this.

494
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:54,239
- This is the house of wonders?
- The best is yet to come

495
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,334
- Let's go upstairs ...
- In heaven?

496
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:01,346
The inferno, <i>mon inferno.</i>

497
00:45:29,342 --> 00:45:32,277
- It's when you want.
- Go ahead, I am.

498
00:45:32,278 --> 00:45:36,760
No, you go first.
I want to admire your ass, ton cul.

499
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,300
Is this all right?
Or do you want to see more?

500
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:03,875
- Hurry!
- Come and catch me!

501
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,476
Incredible!

502
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:39,945
It must have taken you quite
some time to collect all of these.

503
00:46:39,946 --> 00:46:43,939
Oh, I started early, with that one!

504
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,518
It's my ex-wife.

505
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:49,516
She has a very expressive face.

506
00:46:50,122 --> 00:46:51,333
<i>Ah, oui.</i>

507
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:54,660
From her I learned that the physiognomy
of a person is all in the nates!

508
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:58,358
<i>Ici</i>

509
00:46:58,464 --> 00:47:00,599
This is a portrait gallery.

510
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,602
You can distinguish the timid ass,
the brave one, 

511
00:47:03,603 --> 00:47:05,798
the stupid one, the intelligent,

512
00:47:05,872 --> 00:47:09,808
the happy, sad ...

513
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:12,771
Everyone is the ass that he has.

514
00:47:17,784 --> 00:47:20,412
So what am I?

515
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,785
<i>Voyons.</i>

516
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,629
A headstrong, willful, disobedient

517
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:36,268
and a little ... tense.
Introvert.

518
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:39,236
Am I hopeless, Doctor?

519
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:41,830
Not if you can play by the rules.

520
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:43,545
Let's hear the rules.

521
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,378
You must follow orders and do for me
everything I want.

522
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:49,837
But if you cry out once, I stop.

523
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:52,476
Everything, at your command?

524
00:47:52,585 --> 00:47:55,754
- Yes.
- Down on all fours, over there.

525
00:47:55,755 --> 00:47:56,949
Why?

526
00:47:57,223 --> 00:48:01,387
Oh, it's because the game
has already started, and you know it!

527
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:14,189
Feel the ..

528
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,259
Force ... the pride ...

529
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:21,239
- It's gonna hurt me, isn't it?
- You scream and I Quit!

530
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,242
It's up to you.

531
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:43,582
- I'm so scared!
- Do what I say.

532
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,531
And everything will be fine.

533
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:49,368
Breathe deep!
As if you were in child birth, in labor.

534
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:51,337
Breathe with me!

535
00:50:01,981 --> 00:50:04,882
Good, come on!!

536
00:50:08,494 --> 00:50:10,822
Come on!

537
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,396
Was that a scream, Diana?

538
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:18,897
No I broke through the canvas, though.

539
00:50:18,898 --> 00:50:22,390
Oh, don't worry, <i>c'est pas grave,</i>
I'll have it restored.

540
00:50:29,942 --> 00:50:32,877
<i>L'enculeur sauvage!</i>

541
00:50:39,485 --> 00:50:43,437
... The ass is something
divine and precious ...

542
00:51:03,943 --> 00:51:07,379
That's incredible.

543
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,415
That fur piece was still
hanging up in the closet.

544
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:12,784
I found some snapshots, too.

545
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:15,654
- The Old Aunt Emma!
- Who would have guessed?

546
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:19,614
The apartment is the same.
Nothing has changed.

547
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:24,563
- It looks nice.
- We see all of Venice!

548
00:51:24,564 --> 00:51:27,899
For a couple of lovers,
this place is paradise.

549
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,901
Perfect for a young couple
love.

550
00:51:29,902 --> 00:51:34,372
- Yeah, well we can rent it.
- But I wanted to keep us both!

551
00:51:34,373 --> 00:51:38,823
We are a loving couple!
Is not it, darling?

552
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:27,559
It's new, you shave?

553
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,723
Just a little on the sides.

554
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,599
I must be a virtuous woman wise.
I am an heir after all.

555
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,434
- You're a slut!
- And you're a pig!

556
00:52:42,308 --> 00:52:45,810
Aunt Emma got you excited, huh?

557
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:48,446
I guess I should be jealous!

558
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:51,616
I'm the one who ought to be jealous!

559
00:52:51,617 --> 00:52:53,752
Tell me the truth, your cousin came over
to see the apartment, didn't he?

560
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,587
Of course he came over!

561
00:52:55,588 --> 00:52:57,989
Marco wouldn't let a chance
like that go by.

562
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:00,322
Did he make a pass at you?

563
00:53:00,426 --> 00:53:03,628
Well, he began to talk about when
the two of us used to go out together

564
00:53:03,629 --> 00:53:05,563
Tell me.

565
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:08,233
We'd go up to the tip of the Dogana,

566
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:11,362
and he'd touch my little flower
under my skirt and I put my hand on him.

567
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:15,720
- I told him touched the hand.
- Show me how you did it.

568
00:53:17,276 --> 00:53:21,508
Warning! This is tricky!

569
00:53:21,614 --> 00:53:24,282
He'd grab my head and get it right down.

570
00:53:24,283 --> 00:53:26,518
because he wanted me to take
it in the mouth.

571
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:30,455
- What did you do?
- I fought

572
00:53:30,523 --> 00:53:32,889
but not too long.

573
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:36,878
And did you do it again yesterday,
in your apartment on the Giudecca?

574
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,416
Great, fantasies you got?

575
00:54:03,422 --> 00:54:04,912
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:07,459
I know you and Marco
didn't do a thing, right?

577
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,663
I decided to have fun
with Alphonse.

578
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:13,495
Who is he?

579
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:17,454
That French guy at the party
who I danced with.

580
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:20,038
That's how you
christen the apartment.

581
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,564
No, we were at his home ..

582
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:25,200
Nice decor.

583
00:54:25,278 --> 00:54:28,247
Give me the details!

584
00:54:28,314 --> 00:54:32,817
He was crazy about my ass.
He insisted I take it.

585
00:54:32,818 --> 00:54:35,920
I couldn't have avoided it
even if I'd wanted to!

586
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:40,525
He spread my ass and started
licking my crack, down and up.

587
00:54:40,526 --> 00:54:45,293
But it isn't so painful.
I could be persuaded.

588
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:51,678
- And did you..?
- Did I? Like an express train!

589
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,808
What's the matter?
You want me to stop?

590
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:59,010
- Who gave that hickey to you?
- What.

591
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:01,413
- That hickey on your neck!
- I don't know what you mean!

592
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:04,316
I thought it was a story
but you did!

593
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:06,451
No, please, let me explain!

594
00:55:06,452 --> 00:55:08,787
No, it isn't a fantasy this time.
He fucked you!

595
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:11,923
- That bastard prick fucked you!
- No, Paolo, I swear it!

596
00:55:11,924 --> 00:55:16,674
He didn't fuck me at all!
I took it up the ass!

597
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:44,255
Please, darling, don't pout.

598
00:55:44,256 --> 00:55:47,258
- Better to talk it over, huh?
- Get away from me!

599
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:50,829
We've always had a laugh
over my little affairs.

600
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:54,332
You told me they made you horny!
You liked that just swell!

601
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:56,301
Because it was
just stories!

602
00:55:56,302 --> 00:56:00,372
There's no difference, it doesn't matter
in the least. I'm really only yours.

603
00:56:00,373 --> 00:56:03,375
Is it so naughty if I make it
with someone else?

604
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:06,845
I mean it's all,
happy banging, right?

605
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:10,748
Do not count on me
to participate in that!

606
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,451
I guess it seems like the end of the world

607
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:15,552
to you right now, but you'll see, tomorrow

608
00:56:16,989 --> 00:56:19,791
Don't get near me.
We're history, the past!

609
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:23,150
There never will be a tomorrow for us!

610
00:56:28,734 --> 00:56:32,303
I'm not going to share my marriage bed
with someone like you!

611
00:56:32,304 --> 00:56:33,828
You slut!

612
00:56:42,415 --> 00:56:46,103
I shouldn't be surprised after all.

613
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,164
Blood will tell,
but yours should be spilled!

614
00:57:34,005 --> 00:57:35,826
Hey, you look all queer!

615
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:37,810
Thanks to Paolo. Big fight.

616
00:57:38,202 --> 00:57:40,838
- Irreparable?
- He wants a separation.

617
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,541
No kidding! Another woman?

618
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:45,944
- No, something other than that.
- A man...

619
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:48,311
- Paolo?
- No, me.

620
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:50,518
- It was a guy in Venice.
- Oh, really! You had me scared!

621
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:52,447
It's over?

622
00:57:53,768 --> 00:57:54,814
Turn's up!

623
00:57:54,983 --> 00:57:56,356
Let me get the broads outta here!

624
00:57:56,486 --> 00:57:57,533
Head for the showers!

625
00:57:57,637 --> 00:58:00,189
I want to hear all the details!

626
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,469
Why did you tell him?
He would for sure take it badly!

627
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,737
I was tell him stories for fun.

628
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:22,380
Whether your are a whore,
or your are crazy!

629
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:26,442
All men are stupid pigs.!

630
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:30,352
You have to always deny,
even the obvious.

631
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:34,826
They always speak about liberty
for women, but not for theirs!

632
00:58:34,827 --> 00:58:38,363
They're all the same!
I don't want that ended like that!

633
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:40,798
Yesterday I was alone in my bed.
I could not sleep.

634
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:44,587
Find yourself a guy.
You will not be alone!

635
00:58:44,637 --> 00:58:50,269
A woman cannot be satisfied by
only one man.

636
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:53,378
And every man tastes differently.

637
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:54,946
A woman must try a lot of them!

638
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:59,417
Your problem, it's you husband
who left you.

639
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:03,718
You're the one having done 
a mistake!

640
00:59:03,789 --> 00:59:08,192
No, no, no with Paolo
it's really different!

641
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,728
I love him,
I do not want to lose it.

642
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:12,997
- Are you gonna help me?
- How?

643
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:17,492
Talk to him, persuade him,
tell him he is wrong.

644
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,401
Brilliant!

645
00:59:19,505 --> 00:59:22,840
He has to realize the others
do not matter.

646
00:59:22,841 --> 00:59:26,744
- And if he refuses to listen?
- No, he trusts in you,

647
00:59:26,745 --> 00:59:30,665
He appreciates you very much.
Please, Nadia.

648
00:59:31,984 --> 00:59:33,688
I have "Carte blanche"?

649
00:59:33,786 --> 00:59:36,318
What do you mean?

650
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:41,588
A white hair!
My pussy is whitening!

651
00:59:41,694 --> 00:59:43,027
Anyway you get "Carte blanche".

652
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:46,518
Okay then I think
I'll just pop on over at lunch break.

653
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:49,934
Thank you, Nadia. I knew that
I would be able to count on you!

654
00:59:49,935 --> 00:59:52,604
Do you mind if I have
a shower along as I'm here?

655
00:59:52,605 --> 00:59:55,840
I was in such a big rush getting out
this morning. I didn't even take a bidet.

656
00:59:55,841 --> 00:59:57,775
That should never happen. If you must...

657
00:59:57,776 --> 01:00:00,578
put off washing your face, chum
But before leaving, always take a bidet.

658
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:04,697
Hey, you never know
what might be coming up!

659
01:00:54,012 --> 01:00:55,731
Yes?

660
01:00:55,734 --> 01:00:58,703
Yeah? Ah, it's you.
Yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

661
01:01:20,392 --> 01:01:22,326
Hi! I'm glad you came.

662
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:24,729
I could really use your advice.

663
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:26,357
That's true.

664
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:29,457
- Poor idiot!
- Why?

665
01:01:29,568 --> 01:01:31,803
There's a terrific girl
you're treating like scum.

666
01:01:31,804 --> 01:01:33,604
You don't know what she did to me!

667
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:36,774
I certainly do. I just don't see
where it's such a tragedy.

668
01:01:36,775 --> 01:01:39,477
Well, how should I've handled it?
Give her a medal?

669
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:43,948
There was no need to do anything! You've
got the most wonderful girl in the world!

670
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:46,751
She's classy! She's great! Worships you!

671
01:01:46,752 --> 01:01:48,886
So why do you put out her joy of living?

672
01:01:48,887 --> 01:01:52,290
Because wives are supposed to make love
with their husbands, nobody else?

673
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,622
You dumb-ass moron!

674
01:01:53,692 --> 01:01:56,394
We're talking
about a little affair of no importance!

675
01:01:56,395 --> 01:01:58,332
You can't say that
marriage encompassed the universe

676
01:01:58,335 --> 01:02:00,697
or that you represent men of all types!

677
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:05,667
We're not back in the time of your mother
and your father any more, take a look!

678
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:09,062
Would you like Diana to be like her?

679
01:02:09,742 --> 01:02:13,778
No, of course not.
I'm the big loser in this case.

680
01:02:13,779 --> 01:02:17,515
- What can I do? I'm jealous!
- Here we go!

681
01:02:17,516 --> 01:02:20,418
But your jealousy is absurd
and no use!

682
01:02:20,419 --> 01:02:22,410
It's absurd and useless,
there's no kind of sense to it!

683
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:25,957
Paolo, I could understand your misery,
if she were tired of you.

684
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:29,560
But no sorry! She just wants
minimal liberty, sex-wise!

685
01:02:29,561 --> 01:02:32,263
Just the thing
you've always had, you bum!

686
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:34,532
That's what's so horrible! The thought
that she laughs with someone else.

687
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:37,835
That she uses the same little love words
as she does with me!

688
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:41,773
Who's to know?
She might even come!

689
01:02:41,774 --> 01:02:46,720
I'm beginning to feel
there's a time-bomb inside me!

690
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:54,352
A few minutes ago I was asleep and dreaming

691
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,583
that I was with Diana. It was a nightmare.

692
01:02:56,688 --> 01:02:59,418
I'm telling you.
I'm going, I'm going nuts.

693
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,789
I'm with you, Paolo,

694
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,829
and I can prove it to you.

695
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:08,661
I'm all wet.
You feel?

696
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:19,313
If you knew how I wanted
to feel your hands on me.

697
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:21,804
Lie down.

698
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:27,658
Oh, my God ...

699
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:31,375
I'm glad to see I don't turn you off.

700
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:37,691
Diana will not make a scene.

701
01:03:37,796 --> 01:03:41,120
Nobody's going to see
any jealous scenes.

702
01:03:43,368 --> 01:03:44,735
Diana does not care.

703
01:03:44,736 --> 01:03:48,258
- She gave me permission.
- Diana?!

704
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,872
No, no, stop!

705
01:03:50,943 --> 01:03:53,377
I don't want you. I want Diana!
Bullshit!

706
01:03:53,378 --> 01:03:55,947
Your cock said otherwise!
Poor Diana,

707
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:58,883
she thought you were different.

708
01:03:58,984 --> 01:04:01,646
You are all the same.

709
01:04:01,753 --> 01:04:03,888
Full of old-fashioned principles.

710
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:07,347
Honor, virtuousness, betrayal!

711
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:10,862
And a girl who's liberated
is just a slut, right?

712
01:04:10,863 --> 01:04:13,764
Try to understand Nadia.
I can't, I won't!

713
01:04:13,765 --> 01:04:16,400
And if I did, it would be like
admitting Diana was right!

714
01:04:16,401 --> 01:04:19,003
She's right, you're a fool.
She is absolutely right.

715
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:22,872
Fighting it's no use.
You silly bastard!

716
01:04:28,814 --> 01:04:30,941
Your problem is that

717
01:04:31,049 --> 01:04:34,541
you're a fag repressed.
- Your underwear!

718
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,328
I've met assholes before,
but men take the cake!

719
01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:47,521
Here's hell to husbands in general
and ours in particular!

720
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:51,903
Hey, chin up, little sister!
We're out to enjoy life tonight.

721
01:04:51,904 --> 01:04:55,262
Shorten up that long face!

722
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:01,679
Look at that!
Sexy, no?

723
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,874
Not bad! Let's take pot luck!

724
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,659
- Hey, handsome! Approach a little!
- Who, me?

725
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,720
I need information.

726
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:19,533
How are your hunk?

727
01:05:19,598 --> 01:05:22,829
What the fuck!
Come back here, you cunt!

728
01:05:22,935 --> 01:05:24,800
Just don't let me catch you!

729
01:05:26,649 --> 01:05:27,893
Hi, girls!

730
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:33,872
Holy mother of God
What a beautiful ass!

731
01:05:33,946 --> 01:05:35,641
It's a drag queen!

732
01:05:35,747 --> 01:05:37,448
Hey, sweetheart!
You carrying a dong or not?

733
01:05:37,549 --> 01:05:39,713
Watch!

734
01:05:40,886 --> 01:05:44,188
What are you doing with that?
It is small.

735
01:05:44,189 --> 01:05:48,092
- I can stick it in your ass.
- Or I might stick this thing in yours!

736
01:05:48,106 --> 01:05:49,116
Fuck you!

737
01:05:49,118 --> 01:05:50,458
Go assholes, so fuck you!

738
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:54,353
I said it first, you ugly,
pimping, bull-dyke bitch!

739
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:57,294
You fucking bitches, I'll catch you!

740
01:05:58,005 --> 01:05:59,859
When we feel like living it up,
where do we go?

741
01:05:59,954 --> 01:06:01,163
I know a disco, yay!

742
01:06:01,264 --> 01:06:03,118
We can do better than that,
Mother Superior.

743
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:08,713
- A place where anything can happen to you.
- Even the worst?

744
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,182
If you get lucky!

745
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:37,301
Hey, wait.

746
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,664
Girls!

747
01:08:49,975 --> 01:08:51,876
I want something strong.
What do you have?

748
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:54,645
Try a 'Delirium'. It'll make a
corpse dance.

749
01:08:54,646 --> 01:08:57,740
That's exactly what I need.

750
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:02,245
- What's in it?
- Ecstasy.

751
01:09:54,639 --> 01:09:57,775
Excuse me, could you
give me some information?

752
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,744
What size are you carrying?

753
01:10:00,745 --> 01:10:02,980
You shouldn't have to ask. 
We have already met each other!

754
01:10:02,981 --> 01:10:04,812
The seminarian!

755
01:10:04,916 --> 01:10:07,017
With a white collar,
the other day on the bus!

756
01:10:07,018 --> 01:10:11,855
- What are you doing here?
- I'm doing my research!

757
01:10:11,856 --> 01:10:14,391
How can I do a thesis about sin,
and not know what it is?

758
01:10:14,392 --> 01:10:15,996
<i>Viens avec moi!</i>

759
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:31,435
Oh god, I'm gonna scream!

760
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:33,712
Shriek, bellow!

761
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:37,071
Ah, I never met a tongue
with a hard-on, you're great!

762
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:11,342
Are you sick?
No, not at all.

763
01:12:11,343 --> 01:12:13,004
I am OK.

764
01:13:05,697 --> 01:13:07,824
How's it going?

765
01:13:07,932 --> 01:13:10,992
I'm minus underpants!

766
01:13:14,706 --> 01:13:17,138
Give me one of those drinks!

767
01:13:34,959 --> 01:13:36,951
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

768
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,051
What's the news?

769
01:13:38,062 --> 01:13:39,996
No, shit no, back off!

770
01:13:40,265 --> 01:13:42,666
I don't give a fuck
about any guarantee.

771
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:47,217
Just get me the fucking money quick,
or it's your ass!

772
01:13:50,308 --> 01:13:51,332
Paolo!

773
01:13:51,443 --> 01:13:52,570
It's Diana!

774
01:13:52,856 --> 01:13:54,670
You got a party?

775
01:13:54,678 --> 01:13:56,670
Oh, yeah. It's great fun, fantastic!

776
01:13:56,781 --> 01:14:00,584
Diana, it's 4 A.M. You're drunk
Come back home.

777
01:14:00,585 --> 01:14:05,033
- Who is with you?
- Men! A lot of men!

778
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:07,555
A group of fabulous men!

779
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:11,288
It's Paolo! Guys, say hi!

780
01:14:11,362 --> 01:14:13,660
Hi, Paolo!

781
01:14:13,765 --> 01:14:16,325
How's it sound, dear!

782
01:14:16,434 --> 01:14:18,664
Stop it! I forbid you!
I'm your husband!

783
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:20,904
Nah, you know who you are?

784
01:14:20,905 --> 01:14:23,674
You're a dumb stupid asshole!

785
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:27,611
I am free! I can sleep
with the whole planet!

786
01:14:27,612 --> 01:14:30,414
And not only that,
I might not ever come home!

787
01:14:30,415 --> 01:14:33,248
Come back or not, who gives a shit,
you won't find me anyway!

788
01:14:33,318 --> 01:14:36,549
I'm getting my ass outta here.

789
01:14:36,654 --> 01:14:39,487
I've had it.
I go to my parents!

790
01:14:39,591 --> 01:14:42,560
Go, Go, Go!

791
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:45,996
I can't believe I ever sucked
your cock, shitface!

792
01:14:45,997 --> 01:14:48,522
So, hurry to little mama
and, and screw her!

793
01:14:48,633 --> 01:14:50,469
Cuckold!

794
01:14:54,639 --> 01:14:56,766
Where are you going?

795
01:15:14,592 --> 01:15:17,961
- Have you had it with the party?
- Yeah, he's gonna give me a lift.

796
01:15:17,962 --> 01:15:20,797
I am exhausted.
and besides, I'm worried.

797
01:15:20,798 --> 01:15:23,396
Paolo's threatening to move out.

798
01:15:23,401 --> 01:15:25,961
Ah, come on, never!
He's too in love, that boy!

799
01:15:26,237 --> 01:15:29,536
- I'm leaving.
- Fine, great. I'll stay a little more.

800
01:15:29,607 --> 01:15:33,031
I found a hero of the resistance.

801
01:16:19,857 --> 01:16:21,959
Think about what you do, Diana.
Think of us.

802
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,598
I love you. Paolo. "

803
01:16:23,695 --> 01:16:26,359
do you still love me?

804
01:16:31,436 --> 01:16:33,971
Dear Marikla,
not only do I still love him

805
01:16:33,972 --> 01:16:37,274
But in my own way
I feel that I'm a faithful wife.

806
01:16:37,275 --> 01:16:39,876
Going with other men doesn't mean
I'm betraying him.

807
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:44,391
Those are just casual flings
of no importance at all.

808
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,509
Oh, they're great for a quick thrill.

809
01:16:47,619 --> 01:16:51,855
But they have nothing at all to do
with that mixture of body and soul,

810
01:16:51,856 --> 01:16:55,659
that makes my relationship
with Paolo beautiful and unique.

811
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:58,362
That's why I have no guilty feelings,
no contrition,

812
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,558
I have no remorse.

813
01:17:00,665 --> 01:17:05,568
That's why I don't want
the love we share to finish like this.

814
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:08,372
But how do I go about
making him understand that?

815
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,704
Diana.

816
01:17:24,956 --> 01:17:27,722
Journal "Feelings", Milan.

817
01:17:38,525 --> 01:17:39,649
Hey Sara! Come here!

818
01:18:04,962 --> 01:18:07,764
Want some? I just caught.

819
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:12,464
- No! I hate them!
- Feel bad, uh?

820
01:18:12,537 --> 01:18:15,906
Just think, you could be
between Diana's legs right now,

821
01:18:15,907 --> 01:18:17,009
instead of sitting here
eating your heart out.

822
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:18,800
What are you getting out of it?

823
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,311
- Nothing!
- That's bullshit!

824
01:18:21,312 --> 01:18:24,645
- You got a hard-on!
- He's a goddam traitor!

825
01:18:24,749 --> 01:18:27,384
- Anything! You want me to say?
- No, no way! I'll tell you.

826
01:18:27,385 --> 01:18:30,420
Your cock is more
intelligent than you.

827
01:18:30,421 --> 01:18:32,656
He's got his priorities straight, he knows
she gives you everything with love.

828
01:18:32,657 --> 01:18:35,692
He feels that you're acting like
a bit of an ass-hole.

829
01:18:35,693 --> 01:18:38,662
Yes, because actually,
you should approve of her.

830
01:18:38,663 --> 01:18:41,231
Yeah, you know what that means?
That he's a prick!

831
01:18:41,232 --> 01:18:42,632
Yes, God, thank you!

832
01:18:42,633 --> 01:18:45,502
Anyway what good is it
to destroy yourself with jealousy?

833
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:48,680
Develop a sense of irony and
have a laugh about it! With Diana!

834
01:18:51,701 --> 01:18:53,368
Hey there!

835
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,223
Dig up any clams yet?

836
01:19:04,037 --> 01:19:05,376
Hey, you know
I think we should be going!

837
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,643
- Okay!
- Must be looking for us!

838
01:19:19,724 --> 01:19:21,503
Hello!

839
01:19:21,839 --> 01:19:22,863
Yes? Who's there? Hello!

840
01:19:22,974 --> 01:19:25,976
- Please fuck yourself in the ear.
- Who was that?

841
01:19:25,977 --> 01:19:29,276
Probably an anonymous admirer.

842
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,548
This is the second time today.

843
01:19:31,549 --> 01:19:36,891
But he will return, do not worry!
Husbands always do that.

844
01:19:38,422 --> 01:19:40,754
Hello? Hello?

845
01:19:40,825 --> 01:19:42,816
Who is this?

846
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:46,259
Paolo? Is that you?

847
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:48,332
Can't you say some little thing?

848
01:19:49,467 --> 01:19:52,369
You're still hoping! What does he have,
this guy, that's so special?

849
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:54,838
I love him.

850
01:19:54,906 --> 01:19:57,407
He has something special,
but he does not understand.

851
01:19:57,408 --> 01:19:59,603
It's all his fault!

852
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:02,577
Fidelity is not natural!

853
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,615
Yeah, yeah. But anyhow he's gone.

854
01:20:05,683 --> 01:20:07,717
Oh, oh my God, there he is now!

855
01:20:07,718 --> 01:20:09,853
- Who? Paolo!
- No, not Paolo!

856
01:20:09,854 --> 01:20:12,989
The Commodore Scarfatti,
with his latest piece, uh, niece!

857
01:20:12,990 --> 01:20:15,325
That man is so butch
I just can't bear him!

858
01:20:15,326 --> 01:20:18,982
- It's yours!
- Fine, I'll take the commission!

859
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:21,865
Hello, Commodore.
What a pleasure to see you again!

860
01:20:21,866 --> 01:20:24,266
My dear Antonietta.

861
01:20:24,368 --> 01:20:26,700
This is my long-lost niece, Maria.

862
01:20:26,704 --> 01:20:28,035
A new?

863
01:20:28,272 --> 01:20:30,507
Well, your family's remarkable!
All the nieces are so pretty!

864
01:20:30,508 --> 01:20:32,032
Well ...

865
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:34,811
I've told Maria all about your things.
She wants some styles...

866
01:20:34,812 --> 01:20:37,781
that are truly intimate.

867
01:20:37,782 --> 01:20:40,317
- You understand me?
- I certainly do, Commodore.

868
01:20:40,318 --> 01:20:42,419
Let's see what we can find.

869
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,581
What color?

870
01:20:44,655 --> 01:20:46,987
White, red, black?

871
01:20:47,258 --> 01:20:51,361
- Miss, what do you prefer?
- What do you think, uncle?

872
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:55,992
I must ask Antonietta just how
she feels about it.

873
01:20:56,234 --> 01:21:00,432
Well, I always say
there's nothing like black, myself.

874
01:21:00,538 --> 01:21:02,906
When a person has a light complexion
like your niece, 

875
01:21:02,907 --> 01:21:05,273
the effect is sensational!

876
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:08,712
Unless Maria
just stuck in there!

877
01:21:08,713 --> 01:21:11,705
From there? Oh no!

878
01:21:54,725 --> 01:21:56,556
My uncle, Come.

879
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:58,495
Give me your opinion.

880
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,828
I'm coming honey, I am coming.

881
01:22:08,773 --> 01:22:11,970
It sounds a little too big.

882
01:22:12,243 --> 01:22:15,303
Want to show us?

883
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:18,280
Of course, Commodore,
whatever you like!

884
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:23,415
Now do you see what I mean?

885
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,522
It's disgraceful to take advantage
of a young lady like that!

886
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:27,924
Sorry it saddens you.

887
01:22:27,925 --> 01:22:32,021
Next the panties!

888
01:22:32,296 --> 01:22:34,931
This girl is older than it seems.
She knows exactly what she wants.

889
01:22:34,932 --> 01:22:37,696
Perfect!

890
01:22:41,739 --> 01:22:44,808
And now the denouement, a fast fuck!
If he can manage to do it!

891
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:47,277
He'll manage, he'll manage!
And not just one!

892
01:22:47,278 --> 01:22:50,513
It's just evil! Certain perversions
are simply intolerable!

893
01:22:50,514 --> 01:22:52,515
It's all in how you look at it!

894
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:55,719
Do the same and it would bring
lots of customers like him,

895
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,985
and I could take
my retirement!

896
01:22:59,256 --> 01:23:01,424
This is outrageous
he does so with his niece.

897
01:23:01,425 --> 01:23:04,883
I know, and I've seen a lot!

898
01:23:04,996 --> 01:23:07,864
Maybe for the commander,
that's right, love.

899
01:23:07,865 --> 01:23:11,601
Love? He does not know
what it means!

900
01:23:11,602 --> 01:23:15,886
No more than you
who only know the sex!

901
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:24,614
Diana, my dear,
is something wrong?

902
01:23:24,615 --> 01:23:27,584
It's a bad period
I just have to get through.

903
01:23:27,685 --> 01:23:31,855
- I had an argument with Paolo.
- Poor little innocent thing!

904
01:23:31,856 --> 01:23:34,324
You mustn't have the clients
see you like that.

905
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:36,227
Come into my office.

906
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:58,214
So what's going on?
Tell me everything!

907
01:23:58,215 --> 01:24:02,665
There's not much to tell,
Mister Silvio.

908
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:05,882
Paolo left me!

909
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:08,618
Oh my poor dear, cry your heart out.

910
01:24:08,726 --> 01:24:10,557
You'll feel better.

911
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:12,862
It's awful. All because I went to bed
with a couple of other guys.

912
01:24:12,863 --> 01:24:17,391
I'm sorry,
I did not want to hurt him.

913
01:24:17,501 --> 01:24:20,402
Of course, I understand.

914
01:24:20,504 --> 01:24:23,371
You did nothing wrong.

915
01:24:27,378 --> 01:24:29,479
Oh, Mister Silvio.
What are you doing?

916
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,414
Nothing, nothing.

917
01:24:31,482 --> 01:24:33,780
It's going to get better.

918
01:24:35,064 --> 01:24:38,004
Hey! Wowee!

919
01:24:42,059 --> 01:24:45,893
It's him!
I know the sound of that horn!

920
01:24:45,996 --> 01:24:47,832
Diana, where are you going?

921
01:24:47,932 --> 01:24:52,665
I told you:
A husband is just like a bad penny! 

922
01:25:04,949 --> 01:25:07,347
Mr. Silvio is a pig.

923
01:25:20,965 --> 01:25:22,832
How is your family?

924
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:25,995
I did not go see them.

925
01:25:26,237 --> 01:25:27,971
Really? That surprises me.

926
01:25:27,972 --> 01:25:31,341
- I have something to say.
- To me? I'm listening.

927
01:25:31,342 --> 01:25:34,777
I'll begin by saying
I'll never get over what went on.

928
01:25:34,778 --> 01:25:38,598
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious, Diana.

929
01:25:38,649 --> 01:25:42,767
- I'm not joking around, you know!
- I know. Neither do I.

930
01:25:47,658 --> 01:25:50,226
I can not leave you.
It's stronger than me.

931
01:25:50,227 --> 01:25:52,791
Oh, Paolo!
I love you, Paolo!

932
01:25:53,664 --> 01:25:56,566
So I made a decision:
live with your rules.

933
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:59,669
Do what you like
from now on.

934
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:03,094
I love when my man
talk like that!

935
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:08,344
- Who the hell gave you that?
- No, Paolo.

936
01:26:08,345 --> 01:26:11,614
- Paolo, you go again already!
- I just want to know.

937
01:26:11,615 --> 01:26:14,417
Before, I would have said
it was my lover,

938
01:26:14,418 --> 01:26:17,453
This time around I'll just say
that I bumped into a tree.    

939
01:26:17,454 --> 01:26:19,722
Tell me the truth, Diana.
I need to know.

940
01:26:19,723 --> 01:26:23,793
All right Paolo, the French antiquarian,
he's completely mad about little me.

941
01:26:23,794 --> 01:26:26,296
You can do better than that.

942
01:26:26,297 --> 01:26:29,265
Cousin Marco, he's arranging
an elopement with me.

943
01:26:29,266 --> 01:26:30,900
Go ahead, torture me.
Get your jollies?

944
01:26:30,901 --> 01:26:33,703
I have always done everything
to please you.

945
01:26:33,704 --> 01:26:36,004
And I did it, right?

946
01:26:36,907 --> 01:26:39,742
Yes, it's true.
I like the way you are.

947
01:26:39,743 --> 01:26:41,711
I will not ask more questions.

948
01:26:41,712 --> 01:26:46,426
And from now on,
the only truth is that!

949
01:26:52,289 --> 01:26:55,224
What a beautiful ass,

950
01:26:56,493 --> 01:26:58,361
I find
that embellishes this piece.

951
01:26:58,362 --> 01:27:00,597
I bet you have not noticed
it was remakes.

952
01:27:00,598 --> 01:27:02,463
It does not show.

953
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:06,717
There was a long tear
right in the middle.

954
01:27:07,838 --> 01:27:10,707
Did you like
Your first night in Venice?

955
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:13,643
It was great.

956
01:27:13,744 --> 01:27:15,645
That's it
what you have to say?

957
01:27:15,646 --> 01:27:18,248
After all I've done
you dare say that?

958
01:27:18,249 --> 01:27:21,251
It was fantastic
and I've never much enjoyed!

959
01:27:21,252 --> 01:27:23,413
No, not now.

960
01:27:23,487 --> 01:27:25,352
You'll ruin my eye-liner!

961
01:27:25,456 --> 01:27:28,186
I have to go. Late already.

962
01:27:29,326 --> 01:27:32,318
Where are you going dressed like that?

963
01:27:32,429 --> 01:27:37,467
- Date with cousin Marco?
- I have no idea where I'll go.

964
01:27:37,468 --> 01:27:39,736
The weather is beautiful.

965
01:27:39,737 --> 01:27:42,731
Venice is a city that excites me.

966
01:27:42,906 --> 01:27:44,806
And I'm happy!

967
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:48,746
Goodbye, my love.

968
01:28:34,325 --> 01:28:36,623
I'm so in love with, with my husband.

969
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,461
My own way I feel I'm a faithful wife.

970
01:28:38,462 --> 01:28:41,659
The other men are just casual flings.

971
01:28:41,732 --> 01:28:44,594
That's why I feel no guilt.

972
01:28:44,601 --> 01:28:49,877
Believe me, I did nothing wrong.
But how can I get him to see it? Diana.

973
01:28:52,843 --> 01:28:55,539
Dear Diana. Hundreds of girls write me that

974
01:28:55,646 --> 01:28:57,513
they betray their husbands, but love them.

975
01:28:57,514 --> 01:28:59,716
What you call a whopping

976
01:28:59,717 --> 01:29:01,617
is no longer the prerogative of
only the males in our society.

977
01:29:01,618 --> 01:29:04,382
It belongs to the women too.

978
01:29:04,455 --> 01:29:07,490
And men should not be jealous.

979
01:29:07,491 --> 01:29:09,458
I tell my readers

980
01:29:09,493 --> 01:29:12,328
to live marriage as a film,
not like a sporting event.

981
01:29:12,329 --> 01:29:14,197
Instead of torture,

982
01:29:14,198 --> 01:29:16,199
play an imaginary role.

983
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,302
Many women
have understood all that.

984
01:29:19,303 --> 01:29:22,761
Just read their letters. "

985
01:29:27,378 --> 01:29:30,613
Dear Marikla, I work as a cleaner
with a widower.

986
01:29:30,614 --> 01:29:34,417
He likes to look at me and I can not
wear underwear.

987
01:29:34,418 --> 01:29:37,820
I let him touch me
and sometimes more.

988
01:29:37,821 --> 01:29:40,221
Am I abnormal?

989
01:29:50,033 --> 01:29:53,002
Venice is an alcove,
more than just a city.

990
01:29:53,003 --> 01:29:57,673
A French poet named it
<i>sexe, femelle, d'Europe.</i>

991
01:29:57,674 --> 01:29:59,338
Alphonse, isn't it?

992
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:02,093
Mm-hmm.

993
01:30:04,782 --> 01:30:07,376
I love you.

994
01:30:07,484 --> 01:30:09,784
And me?
You love me?

995
01:30:12,055 --> 01:30:15,547
I'll settle for loving this.

996
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:26,291
What about you? Do you love me?

997
01:30:29,306 --> 01:30:32,202
Can't you tell that I love you?

998
01:30:33,944 --> 01:30:36,777
Hey, that area's delicate too,
take it easy!

999
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,948
I know, but for the camera!

1000
01:30:38,949 --> 01:30:41,417
The problem is, I don't know how much
film is left in aunt Emma's camera!

1001
01:30:41,418 --> 01:30:43,886
Forget about the camera!
Concentrate on me!

1002
01:30:43,887 --> 01:30:47,990
Darling, it's true, we should live
our marriage as though it was a film.

1003
01:30:47,991 --> 01:30:52,428
A precious heirloom
for our grand children!

1004
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
END
