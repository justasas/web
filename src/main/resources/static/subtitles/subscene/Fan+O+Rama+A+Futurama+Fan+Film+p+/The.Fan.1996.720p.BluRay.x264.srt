1
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:29,507
Excited and anxious
I await my dream

2
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:33,511
To escape, applaud
And embrace my team

3
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:36,431
Opening day I always can trust

4
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:40,310
It's just for this high
That I crazily lust

5
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:43,730
Return of our hero
Does brighten the days

6
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:47,358
Just briefly, my troubles
Get lost in the haze

7
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:50,820
The grace from the field
Arouses the crowd

8
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:54,407
Reflects on the days
When I was quite proud

9
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,619
I'm more entranced
Than the average fan

10
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,623
I used to play, you see
And I know I still can

11
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,709
That time I drove the ball
With such loft

12
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:09,631
My exit atop shoulders
As they carried me off

13
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,343
This pastime and I
Just fade into one

14
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:17,305
Expanded upon
From father and son

15
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,141
My boy is young
And awkward for now

16
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:23,811
I just need the time
And can show him how

17
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,274
I really am quite close
Just a break away

18
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,944
From straightening things out
And being okay

19
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:35,406
I can help my team
To regain its glory

20
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:39,827
With just a little twist
To the same old story

21
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,831
Players say now
They play for themselves

22
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:47,210
This causes a burning
Within me that dwells

23
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:50,713
The fan is the one
Who pays for the game

24
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:55,009
Which bestows all the riches
And welcomed fame

25
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:58,513
The players will listen
But really don't hear

26
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,809
All the while just hiding
Behind an invisible tear

27
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,312
I grow tired now of all this greed

28
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:10,358
And chart a course to set things free

29
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,611
We got our first caller.
Is that Gil on the cellular?

30
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,613
Yes, sir, it sure is.

31
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:01,909
- What's that I hear in the background?
- That's my Giants watch.

32
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:04,620
- I'm late for work.
- Giants watch, great.

33
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,332
- What do you got for us, Gil?
- It's just I'm really psyched.

34
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,918
Opening day's tomorrow.
We're all psyched.

35
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,422
This is different. I've been waiting
a long time for this one.

36
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,508
- What are you waiting for?
- Bobby Rayburn. We got him.

37
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:21,429
- We're going all the way this year.
- What would you bet on that?

38
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:26,225
- I'd bet everything I own, that's for sure.
- I like this guy. You think Rayburn's...

39
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,729
worth the 40 mil, huh'?
310 lifetime batting average.

40
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,148
He's worth twice that,
three times that.

41
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:36,736
I bet he'd love to hear you say that.
Let's see if we can get him on the line.

42
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,531
- You're gonna get him on the line?
- Yes. Hang on. Let's find Bobby.

43
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,826
When we come back, we will be
talking to Bobby Rayburn.

44
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,411
Great.

45
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,507
You got Bobby Rayburn
on the line yet?

46
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,134
Who the fuck does this
guy think he is'?

47
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:03,930
- Three-time National League MVP?
- That allows him to fuck up my show?

48
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,724
- Hello, I got Rayburn on the line.
- We got him!

49
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,726
And go.

50
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:12,647
Welcome back, we're here with the
hopes and dreams of all Giants fans.

51
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:15,942
Ex-Brave center fielder
and league RBI champ...

52
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:20,112
four of the last five years,
Local boy come home, Bobby Rayburn.

53
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,407
- How you doing, Bobby?
- Hey, Jewel, how you doing?

54
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:27,036
Good to be talking to you.
I want to tell you, I love your show.

55
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,705
- Thanks a lot.
- Bobby, this is Bernie...

56
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:32,708
A lot of fans are on the line
dying to talk to you.

57
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:36,045
But first, how does it feel
to be back in the Bay Area?

58
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,508
I'm telling you, it's great. I grew up
here. The Giants are my homies.

59
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,344
That's good to hear.
But let me ask you this:

60
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,430
You're famous for your
dedication to perfection.

61
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,141
You're one of the
hardest-working players.

62
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,810
Don't forget "good-looking."

63
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:52,854
But come on, now. Bobby, baby...

64
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,482
do you honestly think you are worth
40 million simoleons?

65
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,235
He's one of the best ballplayers
in the league.

66
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:03,614
I'm glad you asked me. I don't like to
put a money value on a human being.

67
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,910
But I think I have given 100 percent
to every franchise I've played with.

68
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,745
Attaway, Bobby!

69
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,622
Thank you for not answering.

70
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,625
- Better retreat.
- She's a riot.

71
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:19,213
What about the fans? Won't all
this money raise their expectations?

72
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,427
I hope so. I consider myself a
baseball fan first and a player second.

73
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:27,638
And in the game of baseball,
it's all about the fans.

74
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,434
- You tell them, Bob.
- And the Juan Primo controversy?

75
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,644
Giants center fielder since 1990.

76
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,981
You come in, bump him to the left.
Some people resent that.

77
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,817
- Bitch!
- I don't think Primo's one of them.

78
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,736
You know, he's a team player.

79
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:45,114
That makes him great.
I look forward to playing with him.

80
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,409
That's great, Bobby.
Let's get back to our callers. Gil?

81
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:52,121
- Yeah, am...? Am I on the air?
- Yes, you are, Gil.

82
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,416
Jewel, why do you
have to be so negative?

83
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,921
Come on, I'm a sweetheart.

84
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:03,007
The guy's making a lot of money.
Would you turn it down?

85
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:04,926
You'd be nuts to turn them down.

86
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:07,428
Why be down on Rayburn
because he's not nuts?

87
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,221
You got a point. I apologize.

88
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,141
- Hey, Bobby, are you listening to me?
- I sure am!

89
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,645
- Thanks for backing me up, man.
- No problem. It's a pleasure.

90
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,980
Just remember
where you heard it first.

91
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:21,025
I played the game.
I know what I'm talking about.

92
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,735
Grew up on the Giants.

93
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,821
My dad moved the family here
when the Giants moved here.

94
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,824
I watched you ever since
you hit the grand slam...

95
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,744
against South Bay
in the '82 city championship.

96
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:36,832
That's when I saw you were somebody
special, and you never let me down.

97
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,211
When the two of you come together,
Rayburn and the Giants...

98
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,215
that's like a magical conjunction,
like the alignment of the planets.

99
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,426
You're gonna bring us all the way.
Who said it first?

100
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,011
You did, Gil! You did!

101
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:52,014
- Attaway, Bobby!
- We hope so.

102
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,142
- Bobby, let's talk about your divorce.
- Christ, look.

103
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:59,271
I just got to the ballpark.
I'm really sorry, but I gotta go.

104
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:03,442
- Really enjoyed talking to you.
- Anytime, Bobby. Good luck out there.

105
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,111
We will be right back.

106
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,822
- I am so surprised he hung up.
- Thank you.

107
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:19,917
Giants haven't had a one-two punch
like this since Mays and McCovey.

108
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,005
Joining the list of bullshit excuses...

109
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,215
we've had a lot of whining...

110
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:30,219
about product quality from certain
members of our sales force.

111
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,431
Example: The two Jima line.

112
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:38,019
Gil, do you see
any quality problems there?

113
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:42,773
Blade's too thin, pommel's too light,
and there's a half tang hidden in there.

114
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,443
Maybe that's why you're not selling.

115
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,321
Sweet.

116
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,617
Somebody made a mistake, man.
I wear number 11.

117
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,705
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- It's cool. Manny, just handle it.

118
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,209
Me? I think this knife's an ass-kicker.

119
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,720
This door, on the other hand,
comes off a foreign car.

120
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,805
Well, need I say more?

121
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,769
- Why are you guys still here?
- There's been a glitch, okay?

122
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,979
- I'm working on it.
- What's a "glitch"?

123
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,775
A detail that hasn't been worked out.
Permutation that happens in...

124
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,735
What? With my number?

125
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,237
- Yeah, with your number.
- No, no, no.

126
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,323
Manny, you know I wear number 11.

127
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,034
- Of course.
- So there shouldn't be any problem.

128
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:37,828
It is a problem. Primo wears 11.

129
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,838
Tickets in yet?

130
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,508
Tickets? What tickets?

131
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,636
- Opening day.
- You got other things to worry about.

132
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,724
I'll let you in on a little secret, Gil.
You came this close to kissing pavement.

133
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,935
- How about that close?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,480
Management had you on the list.
I talked them out of it.

135
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,482
Don't make me regret it.

136
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,819
- Thanks, master.
- Okay, fuck it.

137
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:12,613
I'm not playing with number 33.
You understand?

138
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,241
I know. Just be cool.
Let me take care of it.

139
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,327
Three times 11 is 33.
You may play three-times better.

140
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,538
Thanks. I'll talk to you in a minute.

141
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,707
Jesus was 33 when he died.
People still talk about him.

142
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,335
- Give me my number.
- Think about it, seriously.

143
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,212
Should I fire him?

144
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,841
I should fire him, huh?
I should fire his butt.

145
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,636
Good form.

146
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,430
Seriously. I promised those tickets
to my clients.

147
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,933
Don't make me look
like an asshole. Please.

148
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,978
- I do have a reputation to uphold.
- A reputa...

149
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:46,856
Jesus-fucking...

150
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:51,527
Nobody cares. You're stuck in a
time warp with your head up your ass.

151
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,740
- Why, because I don't wanna sell crap?
- We are not dedicated to perfection!

152
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:59,827
People don't want quality.
They want cheap product.

153
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:04,331
When that fucks up, they want to
replace it, so that's what we give them.

154
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,842
You got till the end of the month, Gil.

155
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,845
Look“.

156
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:21,932
McKinley and Everest is our
biggest account. You better close on it.

157
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,853
Bring in the fucking numbers.

158
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,356
Asshole.

159
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,405
Sid, what was the missing link
on your ball club last season?

160
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:41,035
We'd have made the playoffs if Rayburn
hadn't hit that three-run shot in Atlanta.

161
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,039
Everybody said, "Why don't we
have a slugger like that?" Now we do.

162
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,542
- Bobby, a picture?
- Why don't we take one with Primo.

163
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,212
- Sounds good.
- Keep smiling.

164
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,214
Keep fucking smiling.

165
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:58,552
- I hope you like it in center field.
- Yeah, I hope you like it in left.

166
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,267
No more questions.

167
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:11,273
2.5 million signing bonus.
Half this year and half the next. Yeah.

168
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,569
Well, well, if it isn't Jewel, my favourite
token female sports reporter.

169
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,031
- Blow me, Manny.
- I would, but you haven't had your shots.

170
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,159
There were also bonuses
based on winning the MVP...

171
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,578
I want an interview
with Rayburn, Manny.

172
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,165
Are we talking about "the
overpaid, overrated SOB...

173
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,334
with the pending divorce" Rayburn?

174
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,255
- I call them as I see them.
- Well, you've been crossed off the list.

175
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,508
- I knew you'd understand.
- Deferred payments starting 2007.

176
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:43,264
Cut the crap. Are you saying there's
no way to get your boy to talk to me?

177
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,183
Is that what you're saying?
He's gotta talk to me.

178
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:50,229
I'm saying he'd rather nail his penis
to a burning building.

179
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:54,358
I'm not talking to
you, I'm talking to her.

180
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,360
Checkout this puppy.

181
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:58,570
The walk and the talk.

182
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,448
How's it walk? How's it talk?
This is the one.

183
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,286
Are you happy with your
current supplier?

184
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:10,165
Any more of these demonstrations,
I'll have to start shaving my legs.

185
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,376
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

186
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,463
The big motherfucker, the little
motherfucker. Which do you want?

187
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,884
Any more demos, I'll have to start
shaving the hairs on my ass.

188
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:25,180
As you can see, the performance
on this baby is really something.

189
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,691
Knife doing business.

190
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,360
Come on, bring it, baby. Bring it.

191
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,663
- Jesus Christ.
- Poetry in motion, baby.

192
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,966
- Two behind home plate?
- I'm your man.

193
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,551
Two hundred dollars each.

194
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,762
- Two hundred apiece?
- Two hundred.

195
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,017
- That's a lot. How about 125?
- Fuck 125. This is opening day here.

196
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:14,063
- Two hundred, goddamn it. Jesus.
- Okay, okay, okay.

197
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,275
Now you want the tickets, huh?

198
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,781
Anytime I can do you more fucking
favors, you just let me know, all right?

199
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,451
You in a coma or what, buddy?
Get the fuck out of here.

200
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,954
- Know what bugs me about you guys?
- Like I care.

201
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,082
You don't even care about the game.

202
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:38,253
You ebony god, you prince of darkness,
you Othellian Moor, you black man!

203
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,965
You look good out there! You look
good. I bet we hit 400 this year.

204
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:45,969
- Come on, don't jinx me.
- I'm sorry, man. I get emotional, crazy.

205
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,181
All right, so tell me, what we got?

206
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:53,519
Spalding wants you to sign their balls.
We got that "Wish Upon a Star" -routine:

207
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:58,023
Sick kid wants to shake hands with
great ballplayer. You'll have to do.

208
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,653
What do you think? Maybe I should
bring a ball for the sick kid.

209
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,656
No, I think a bat would be much nicer.

210
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,659
All right, here. Give him a bat.

211
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,078
You know it's not a good time for this.

212
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,375
- What's the gentleman's name again?
- His name's Stanley. Stanley Jackson.

213
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,586
Thank you, Michelle.

214
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,347
Stanley, Gil Renard.
Renard & Garrity hunting supplies.

215
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,724
- How do you do?
- How you doing?

216
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,726
Here's my card.

217
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,315
Are you happy
with your current supplier?

218
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:43,026
- I sure am.
- Well, then let me just...

219
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,948
If you could give me three minutes
of your time, I will prove to you...

220
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,658
- Can I demonstrate?
- Sure.

221
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,660
If I can just prove to you...

222
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:57,082
we're superior in quality because
of our fit, hand-sharpening, polishing...

223
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,878
and strength.

224
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,548
These features, combined with our
low prices, our superior terms...

225
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,968
make us one of the most
sought-after competitors around.

226
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:11,472
- That's why I'd...
- We signed an exclusive with Gerber.

227
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,599
They got the whole chain sewed up.

228
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:17,019
We can't pass wind in a tent
without going through them.

229
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,812
Sorry to hear that.

230
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,859
- Do you have the Little Pecker?
- Yes, I do.

231
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,864
- You really are on the cutting edge.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,366
I'm sorry we can't do business.

233
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,786
Well, you're sure I can't
interest you in this?

234
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,583
You got any kayaks?

235
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,879
You gotta be
out of your mind. Kayaks?

236
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,548
I could use kayaks.

237
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:51,178
Stanley, what the fuck do kayaks
have to do with knives?

238
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,055
Never mind.

239
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,808
You fucking asshole. Kayaks?
When I'm asking you about knives?

240
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,603
Yeah. I understand, sir.
Thank you for coming in.

241
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:03,899
How about you get some kayaks and
stick them up your fucking ass, moron.

242
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,984
Your stopwatch.

243
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,078
Hey, thanks a lot for coming.
Nice to meet you.

244
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,164
Look. We got the same hairdo.

245
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,668
You sick too?

246
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,963
Hey, slugger, come on,
shake his hand.

247
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:31,468
How you doing, man? You hanging
in there? What's your name?

248
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,762
Sean.

249
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,847
Sean?

250
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,308
Sean.

251
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,521
Wow, what a coincidence.
That's my son's name too.

252
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,775
Look, I have a present for you.

253
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,986
There you go.

254
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,154
Maybe it'll make you feel better.

255
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,283
Bobby Rayburn.

256
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,247
Tomorrow...

257
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:03,250
hit a home run for me.

258
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:09,381
- Please?
- I'll try.

259
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:14,177
They said "sick," not "dying in front
of our eyes." How'd I know?

260
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:18,724
As if I don't have enough to worry
about. I get a poor kid on his deathbed.

261
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,726
- Oh, please.
- The kid was dying!

262
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:24,187
He has my son's name.
I mean, what kind of shit is that?

263
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,361
Lucky tie, lucky guy.

264
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,660
McKinley-Everest.

265
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,871
Okay, thank you.

266
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,665
Hi.

267
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:48,378
- Angie, you're looking as lovely as ever.
- He's gone.

268
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,674
- We had an appointment at 4.
- Yeah, it's 4: 11.

269
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:56,678
My watch is slow, I guess.
When will he be back?

270
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,057
He's gone for the day. But you
can see him tomorrow at 2:30.

271
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:04,019
Oh, tomorrow, tomorrow...

272
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,191
Let's see.

273
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,153
See if there's anything...

274
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,370
I would prefer the morning.

275
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,580
But how about late in the day?

276
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,957
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:28,960
Tomorrow at 3, he's off
to Chicago for three weeks.

278
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,880
Well, that's a problem.

279
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,966
It's my son. I want to take him
to opening day.

280
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,553
You know, myself as a father,
I'm a real cutup.

281
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,722
I'm gonna get to the point.

282
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,809
I'm trying to be a hero to my son...

283
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:48,313
so if he could make it any other time,
it would really, really help me.

284
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,691
Just an hour later...

285
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,484
so I could fit the game in.

286
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:56,655
- Excuse me. McKinley-Everest.
- Any other time at all? Anything?

287
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,574
- Okay, thank you.
- It would be a big help to me.

288
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,159
Like, an hour later.

289
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,955
I'm afraid I really can't help you.
He's got such a crazy schedule.

290
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,582
Okey-dokey.

291
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,964
Drop your cock and grab your socks.
Big day today. You excited?

292
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,966
Yeah, I'm up.

293
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,553
Manny, Manny, talk to me, man.
Make me happy.

294
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,389
Wish I could.
I just talked to Primo's people.

295
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,058
- They want 500 grand.
- Five hundred? For what?

296
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:29,187
Exactly. Exactly.
That's 250 G's a digit.

297
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,815
Man, come on!
What is this boy smoking?

298
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,861
I tried to haggle them down.
The kid says it's his lucky number.

299
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:40,031
Shit. Ain't that much luck in the world.
He's lucky to be in the country.

300
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,659
I hear you. Look, it's your call.

301
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,579
You want me to go back,
or are you happy with 33?

302
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,248
- Man, it's just a number, right?
- That's right.

303
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,251
I'll pick you up.
While you do her, think of me.

304
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,962
- That's a real short thought.
- I love you too.

305
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,381
- No, you don't.
- I'll catch you later.

306
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,467
Yeah.

307
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,023
Hey, Gil.

308
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,567
Hey, Ted.

309
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,361
Lose your job?

310
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,782
- It's my day off. And it's Tim.
- Tim. Sorry.

311
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,451
- You remember Mike and Linda?
- Hey, Gil.

312
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,578
- Hi, en.
- Hi.

313
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,665
- You're late. What a surprise.
- Traffic. You know, traffic?

314
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,168
How original.

315
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,670
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing?

316
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,465
- Good.
- Ready for the game?

317
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,385
- What time will he be home?
- Depends on the game. Right, slugger?

318
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,889
6:05. He's not home, I call the cops.

319
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,518
I'm against this.
I wanna make that real clear to you.

320
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,896
- He's my kid too.
- Yeah?

321
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,816
Give me kisses. I love you.

322
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:59,986
- Bye.
- For the record, so everybody knows...

323
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,656
don't make him do things
he doesn't want to.

324
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:05,867
I don't. Do I make you do things
you don't want to do?

325
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:08,161
- No.
- Okay?

326
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,248
Six o'clock, Gil.

327
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,669
Hey, Ted.

328
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,379
See you.

329
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,860
I remember when Mick recorded this,
February '78.

330
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,279
What?

331
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,367
I remember when Mick recorded this
in '78. We had a wild party afterwards.

332
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,287
Jason Pelligrini's dad
says Mick Jagger's gay.

333
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:54,249
Yeah? Well, Jason Pelligrini's dad
takes it up the ass.

334
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,966
- Tryouts are next week.
- Tryouts are next week?

335
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,260
Your mother didn't tell me.

336
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:09,306
Jason Pelligrini said his dad's
gonna pick me if I'm still available.

337
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,809
You'll make it. Positive things
happen to positive thinkers.

338
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:21,651
Tell me, what do you gotta do? What
are the three whats you gotta be?

339
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,030
- I don't want to do this, Dad.
- At bat, come on.

340
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,158
- Keep the bat low.
- No, keep it high, high.

341
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,952
- When you move your feet?
- Step on the eggshell...

342
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,955
and squash the bug.
Attaboy. That's perfect.

343
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:38,084
That's what Coop used to say.
I told you about what Coop said, right?

344
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:42,380
- Your old catcher, right?
- One of the finest athletes I ever knew.

345
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,055
Where'd you get that glove?

346
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,515
Tim gave it to me.

347
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,601
Piece of shit.

348
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,956
Opening day at
Candlestick Park, 1996.

349
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,249
What's not to love
about opening day?

350
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,379
Fathers sneaking away from work,
and kids playing hooky from school.

351
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,674
For at least one day,
everybody is in first place.

352
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,219
Opening day is what baseball's about.
How exciting is it...

353
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,888
for Giants fans
with Rayburn coming home...

354
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,724
after leading the Braves
to a championship?

355
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,865
Did you see that?
See the way he moved his legs?

356
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,076
- Can I have a hot dog?
- A what?

357
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,953
Can I have a hot dog?

358
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,247
You're in my seat.

359
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,458
If it isn't the ubiquitous
queen of AM radio herself.

360
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,086
Good morning, my sweet angel,
darling, baby.

361
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:04,671
Oh, yeah, whatever.

362
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,383
Manny, come on, don't dick me around.
It's an important piece, okay?

363
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,512
There's somebody there behind
that killer smile. I promise..."

364
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,390
I will not hurt your boy.
I want Bobby Rayburn.

365
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,600
Bernie, correct me if I'm wrong...

366
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:21,813
but isn't she the ball-buster
who had the temerity to ask my client...

367
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,190
if he was honestly worth 40 million?

368
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,151
- Am I a ball-buster?
- Yeah.

369
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,278
Thank you.

370
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:31,156
- Whose is this?
- It's mine. I spit in it.

371
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,955
I thought your mother
confiscated that.

372
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,957
She did.

373
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,752
Play ball!

374
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,221
Yeah, attaway!

375
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,858
Strike.

376
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,946
What are you doing? You missed it.
Hawkins struck him out.

377
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,365
- Pay attention.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

378
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:58,660
Blaze winds, and the pitch to Pryor...

379
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,162
swung on and driven deep
towards the gap.

380
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,956
He crushed it!

381
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,669
- Watch, watch, watch.
- What?

382
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:09,963
I got it!

383
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,757
I got it!

384
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,010
Primo and Rayburn giving chase.
They converge and...

385
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,221
Lookout!

386
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,603
Center field makes the calls.

387
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,946
Fundamental of baseball,
center field makes the calls.

388
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,573
Pay attention.

389
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,368
Well, a scary moment on day one.

390
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,664
I'll tell you, Rayburn's slow getting up.
And Primo's still slow getting up.

391
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,750
There's $40 million out there
in center field, Steve.

392
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,086
Hope the Giants have
collision coverage.

393
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:53,173
This will help relieve the pain.

394
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,802
- Doc, is the rib bruised or fractured?
- Neither.

395
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:01,598
Bobby, what are you doing?
We got 161 games to go out there.

396
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,808
Could you excuse me for a minute?

397
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,895
Thank you. You just signed
a $40 million contract.

398
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,898
Hurt yourself, you'll be batting
a 100 by month's end.

399
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,567
The media will turn on you
faster than the fans.

400
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,570
- Listen, you gotta come out.
- I can't.

401
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,572
I gotta be Babe-fucking-Ruth.

402
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,158
It's William-fucking-Bendix.
Get it right.

403
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,250
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

404
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:34,547
I'm just gonna make some phone calls.
Okay? Just business calls. I'll be back.

405
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:39,010
- Go?
- Just downstairs for a minute.

406
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:42,013
Mom said we have to be home by 6,
or she'll be upset.

407
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:43,723
Forget about your mother.

408
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,450
I got it!

409
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:15,463
The wind took it. The wind took it.
Kid was lucky.

410
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,382
Kid was lucky.

411
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:19,509
Wind took it.

412
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:23,388
- You stepped on me.
- Don't worry. We'll get one next time.

413
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:27,392
Okay, I gotta go, all right?
I'll be back.

414
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:33,022
- You don't have to pee or anything?
- No.

415
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,660
What happened?

416
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,455
Lanz hit one to right. Bases loaded.
Come on, grand slam!

417
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:53,084
Don't get greedy, son.
What we need now is a sacrifice.

418
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,963
A winning team knows how to
manufacture runs. Coop taught me that.

419
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:00,591
Know why he said the most
beautiful play is a sacrifice fly?

420
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,387
- You sacrifice for the team?
- And doesn't bring down your average.

421
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,307
That's why baseball's
better than life. It's fair.

422
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,017
Tell me what happens.

423
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,811
Now batting, number 33...

424
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:14,314
Bobby Rayburn.

425
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,358
Come on, Bobby!

426
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,163
Attaway, Bobby!

427
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,393
Rayburn look a little stiff to you?

428
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,521
I can't believe they left him in
after that collision.

429
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:59,150
Right. That's all we need,
our $40 million man on the DL.

430
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:09,869
He's playing hurt. That's a
man showing his mettle.

431
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:15,166
Putting the team first. Remember,
last year he hit 314 against lefties.

432
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,378
Yo, Bobby!

433
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:29,055
- Time!
- Oh, fuck.

434
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,016
Come on, let's play some
fucking baseball!

435
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,045
All right, Bobby, let's go!

436
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,172
Play!

437
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,890
All right, Bobby!

438
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:16,018
- Go for it, Bobby!
- Go, Bobby!

439
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,895
Bobby!

440
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,983
Hey, buddy...

441
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,569
you wanna sit down?
Trying to see here.

442
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,446
Go, Bobby!

443
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,011
Come on! Let's go with
the fucking game! Shit!

444
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,891
Strike!

445
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:59,187
Are you out of your mind, ump?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

446
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:01,814
- Hey, sit down.
- Take your hands off me.

447
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,566
- Stop pushing, man!
- Just ask.

448
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:07,945
- Why the fuck you pushing? I'm asking.
- Both of you, down in front!

449
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:11,949
- Fuck you!
- Down in front! Now!

450
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,586
Let's play some fucking ball!
You all right?

451
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:28,799
What's your fucking problem?

452
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,302
You old busybody!

453
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:35,014
I gotta go, okay? I'll be back.

454
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,225
Fuck you!

455
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,152
Oh, fuck.

456
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,325
Get out of here.

457
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:41,747
So could you just send me
over the stats? Yes.

458
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,000
Okay. Thank you very much.

459
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,919
I'm sorry I'm late.
Your hair looks nice.

460
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:50,715
- I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid he left.
- He left.

461
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:52,842
- For the ball game.
- What?

462
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,552
Yes, for the ball game.

463
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,638
- I thought he had a plane to catch.
- Plans changed.

464
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:03,060
But he did leave you this note.

465
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:10,026
- He didn't draw a smiley face, did he?
- What?

466
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,904
The previous assistant got him
in the habit of drawing a smiley face...

467
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:18,993
instead of "sincerely," and I keep
telling him it's not always appropriate.

468
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:22,496
No, it's perfectly appropriate.

469
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,937
Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.

470
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,911
Hey, congratulations, fellas.

471
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,623
Hey, Babe-fucking-Ruth.

472
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:08,125
- William-fucking-Bendix.
- That's right.

473
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,503
So did the kid see his home run?

474
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,546
The kid didn't even see it.

475
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:16,050
He slipped into a coma,
and he never pulled out. I'm sorry.

476
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:19,345
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Like you take bad news well.

477
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:23,933
What am I supposed to say?
"Great news, the kid didn't make it."

478
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,062
That's all right, man.
Enough of these hospital gigs.

479
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:31,107
They're off the list.
You know what the bright side is?

480
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,901
You knocked the cover off the ball.
You're back.

481
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,195
The hell I did. It was a fluke.

482
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,406
I never even saw the pitch.

483
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:44,787
Let go, Tim.

484
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,792
- What do you want?
- How is he? He okay?

485
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:53,003
He's not. He's crying his eyes out.
What do you think?

486
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,631
- Come on, don't start.
- Don't you start.

487
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,259
You violated your agreement.
I called my lawyer.

488
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,344
I'm getting a restraining order.

489
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,930
- Don't start.
- No, don't you start. Go away.

490
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:06,559
- I've had it. I don't care what you want.
- Let me see him.

491
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:09,854
You had to bring him home?
What is wrong with you?

492
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:13,899
- I want you out. Tim, call the cops.
- I'm gonna explain to him.

493
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:17,111
- Come on, everything's okay.
- You bastard.

494
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,990
You motherfucker! You cocksuck...!

495
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,409
_ Hey.
Tim!

496
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,122
Tim, call the cops. He fucking hit me!

497
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,709
Hey. Hey, slugger.

498
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:35,004
Slugger, I'm sorry. You forgive me?

499
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,465
- Hey.
- You left me.

500
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:39,967
I know, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

501
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:43,137
- You forgive Dad?
- Mom's got a terrible headache.

502
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,931
Well, that's called a migraine.
She'll live.

503
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,435
Look what I got for you.
I got your favourite pizza.

504
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,523
Gil, open the door!

505
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:01,113
- Gil, open the door.
- It's got pepperoni and mushroom.

506
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:04,408
- I don't like mushrooms.
- You can pick them off.

507
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:10,414
Is it true, if Mom marries Tim,
I'm not gonna be a Renard anymore?

508
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,836
- Gil, open the door.
- It's open!

509
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,130
- It's locked.
- It's open.

510
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:21,842
It's locked, Gil. Open the door now.
I'm calling the police.

511
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:25,429
You still worried about the tryouts?

512
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:28,432
I don't know.
Think I'll make the majors?

513
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:31,435
Of course you'll make it.
Remember what I said.

514
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:35,231
Positive things happen
to positive thinkers. Who said that?

515
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,317
- Coop.
- Damn straight.

516
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,612
He was the greatest player
I ever played with.

517
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:44,615
Gil, unlock the door.

518
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:46,116
Got you a Coke.

519
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,286
Call the cops.

520
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:52,206
Didn't you hear me? Call the cops!

521
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,000
Call the fucking police!

522
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,253
- I can't drink Coke.
- Who says?

523
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:00,464
Mom and Dad. I mean, Tim.

524
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,467
The door's locked. It's okay.

525
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:06,136
Gil, open the door.

526
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,145
Hey, Art.

527
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:18,607
I said, "Enough of this shit.
You sign the contract right now."

528
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:22,987
He signed it. I swear to God,
on my honor, he signed the contract.

529
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:25,114
Hey, Gil, got a second?

530
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:27,491
If you do. It's 8:00.

531
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,618
- Shall we?
- There you go.

532
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,621
Sit down, Gil.

533
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:36,208
That's okay, I'll stand.

534
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,003
Chuck from McKinley and Everest
called yesterday.

535
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:43,632
Said they wanted to drop
their account with us.

536
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,969
I sent Figgy over there
to sort things out.

537
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,762
You sent Figgy down?

538
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,266
- Sit down, Gil.
- Yeah, he sorted them out.

539
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:56,854
He did it with my opening-day tickets.
What are you gonna do about it?

540
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:00,190
- He didn't steal your account.
- He did. What will you do?

541
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,318
We gave him your account.

542
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,487
I gave him your account.

543
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,490
What do you mean?

544
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,494
You're not getting
the numbers we need.

545
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,998
I know. It's been a little slow
last couple of months.

546
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,627
But that'll change. I've got
a new strategy. It's gonna work.

547
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:23,047
- Listen, your behaviour is unacceptable.
- What do you mean?

548
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:28,260
- People are scared of you.
- Why, because of the other day?

549
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:31,931
You cannot do things like that
in this day and...

550
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,851
I want your reorder book.

551
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,564
Outstanding commissions
will be forwarded.

552
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,910
My father started this business.

553
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:57,706
Look, perfection and principles don't
belong in business, not now or then.

554
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,001
- As a friend of your father's...
- Keep your mouth shut.

555
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,128
You know nothing about my father.

556
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,969
- He made this business.
- Your father made knives.

557
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,138
- San Francisco made this business.
- By ripping him off.

558
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,849
He wasn't a businessman, Gil...

559
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:18,435
and neither are you.

560
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,563
That's the bottom line.

561
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:58,559
And so, in a Freudian sense, Jewel...

562
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,854
the catcher is the father,
and the son is the pitcher.

563
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,314
That's fascinating.
Let me ask you.

564
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:08,402
- What does the bat and ball represent?
- Well, the bat speaks for itself...

565
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,988
and, of course,
the ball is the ejaculate.

566
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,199
Thanks for calling, doc.
Who do we have on line two?

567
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,619
- Do we have anybody on line two?
- I believe everybody hung up.

568
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:23,250
Hey, man. Hey, you got a van?
Kids are breaking into your van.

569
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:27,129
Somebody's breaking into your van.
Stop those kids. Cut that out.

570
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:29,631
- What?
- Kids breaking into a van out there.

571
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,634
- Yeah.
- Here, this is for you.

572
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,553
- What's that?
- Take it. Take it.

573
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:37,056
- Take it.
- What is it?

574
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,642
It's for you.
It's a temporary restraining order.

575
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,644
- What?
- You have been served.

576
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,024
Hey, man, can I use your...?

577
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:49,401
Okay, last one.

578
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:53,489
Good swing. All right, who's next?

579
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:56,200
Eleven. Let's go, buddy.
Hustle up there.

580
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,118
- Okay, pal.
- Come on, Rich.

581
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,623
Okay, watch the ball.

582
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:04,792
Good swing.

583
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:07,961
Next one, Richie.

584
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,759
Attaway, Richie boy.

585
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,142
- That's okay.
- He's throwing too hard.

586
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:24,937
He almost took his head off.
Hey, coach. Coach.

587
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,939
- Yeah.
- Slow down.

588
00:43:27,356 --> 00:43:29,900
- This is Little League. Little League.
- I know.

589
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,986
- Leave him alone, Gil.
- Mind your fucking business.

590
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:37,616
Hey, coach, mix in some strikes.
What are you doing?

591
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:40,327
- You're making it hard.
- I'll coach from here.

592
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,123
- Mix in some strikes.
- He's throwing strikes, Gil.

593
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:47,167
- Fuck it, I'm gonna go down.
- Easy, Gil.

594
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:50,129
Remember, Ellen's got
that restraining order on you.

595
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:53,257
- The bat is too fucking heavy.
- Come on.

596
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,636
You fuck with me,
I'll send your head into the outfield.

597
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,435
Go easy. You're letting the bat
swing him.

598
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:09,398
- Hey, hey, come on, you guy.
- Look how heavy this bat is.

599
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,191
Here.

600
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,198
Let go of my son.

601
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:21,118
- He's my son too.
- Don't remind me. Get off him.

602
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:24,288
- He's my son too.
- You are not gonna ruin our lives.

603
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:28,000
- Tim, call the cops now.
- I'm just trying to tell him something.

604
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,043
Get out of here. Tim!

605
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:34,464
You get out of here.
Can't you read, stupid?

606
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,843
The restraining order says
you have to stay 100 yards away.

607
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,762
- Tell him one thing.
- You can't come near him.

608
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:43,640
- I wanna tell him one thing.
- Get out of here.

609
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:46,643
- I just wanna tell him one thing.
- You better go.

610
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:50,439
Don't swing at anything.
Wait for a good one.

611
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:54,109
Step on the eggshell,
squash the bug. Okay?

612
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:59,823
You mind your fucking business.
You're lucky.

613
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:06,121
Just give him... Give him something.
He's a kid.

614
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:15,964
It's okay. Play ball.

615
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,134
Bobby Rayburn again
failed to earn his keep.

616
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:22,054
Almost grounding into
a game-ending double play...

617
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:24,139
just beating the throw to first.

618
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,350
When the Giants
needed a pick-me-up...

619
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,937
number 11, Juan Primo,
provides San Francisco with a lift.

620
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:33,899
And it was a big one. His two-run
shot over the left-field fence...

621
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:36,818
scored Rayburn,
and the Giants went home happy.

622
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,488
That is, except possibly
Bobby Rayburn...

623
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:43,492
Whose lac kof hitting is giving
new meaning to the term "three hole."

624
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:46,620
The way Primo's carried
this team on his shoulders...

625
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:49,790
makes you wonder who the real
$40 million player is.

626
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:00,550
Lanz came up with a big hit to drive
in a key run in the Giants' victory.

627
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:03,428
Jimmy has been a spark plug
during this home stand.

628
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,143
Motherfuck.

629
00:47:13,457 --> 00:47:17,836
Ladies and gentlemen, now batting,
the center fielder, number 33...

630
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:21,048
Bobby Rayburn.

631
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:38,690
All right, Bobby, let's go!

632
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,317
All right, Bobby.

633
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,335
Strike.

634
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,343
Strike.

635
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,767
- Strike three.
- Shit.

636
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,145
Ladies and gentlemen,
with courtesy to the players...

637
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:19,898
please refrain
from excessive noise...

638
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:23,402
and throwing anything
onto the field. Thank you.

639
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,988
Forty-million-dollar man's
paying off, huh?

640
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:32,619
Now batting, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

641
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,665
Well, here it is, Memorial Day weekend.

642
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:40,836
You think back to the opening-day
grand slam, doesn't seem long ago.

643
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:44,131
But lately, Bobby Rayburn
has really had difficulties...

644
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,759
and can't seem to find his stroke.
He lacks aggressiveness.

645
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:50,762
And you start to wonder
when you call it a slump.

646
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:53,557
Most superstars aren't gonna
sit down for you.

647
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,267
But you gotta wonder...

648
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:58,145
when he's gonna
breakout of this thing.

649
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:05,902
Strike.

650
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,248
Come on, Bobby. Come on.

651
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,610
Out.

652
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:57,496
Now batting, number 46, Jimmy Lanz.

653
00:49:57,913 --> 00:49:59,748
You'll be all right.

654
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:07,130
You still want that interview?

655
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:11,968
You'd let Bobby Rayburn do an
interview with a...? What was it?

656
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:15,931
- Castrating ball-buster.
- Castrating ball-buster, that's it.

657
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,934
- I thought I was off your list.
- Come on.

658
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,144
Schindler has a list, not me, okay?

659
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:24,397
When you're hitting 183,
you don't get to have a list.

660
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,820
Locker room.

661
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:33,490
- Giants' Locker room.
- Bobby Rayburn.

662
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,993
- Yeah, who's calling?
- A friend of his. I have to talk to him.

663
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,995
It's really important.

664
00:50:39,204 --> 00:50:41,039
Rayburn, phone.

665
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,335
- Yeah, this is Bobby.
- Bobby?

666
00:50:45,669 --> 00:50:48,129
- Yeah.
- Bobby Rayburn.

667
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:50,549
Yes. Yes, who is this?

668
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:53,760
Hello. Look, say something.

669
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,554
Hello?

670
00:50:56,555 --> 00:51:00,350
Yo, Stook, I thought you were
supposed to screen my calls here.

671
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:30,255
- Burn, baby, burn.
- Come on, give me some.

672
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:33,550
- What's up, Dad? Gaining a little weight.
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

673
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:37,137
- Stopped by the doughnut spot.
- Cool. Is he for me?

674
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:39,139
Yeah, he's for you.

675
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:41,266
What's his name?

676
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:44,644
- He told me it's Bradley.
- What else did he say, Dr. Doolittle?

677
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:48,815
Dad, how come
you haven't been hitting?

678
00:51:56,323 --> 00:51:57,907
How's the rib cage, Bobby?

679
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,619
My rib cage is sick
of people asking about it.

680
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,538
They say you should've
came out that first game...

681
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,666
but you were hot-dogging,
so you screwed yourself.

682
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:10,253
That supposed to be a dis
or something? I hit 314 last season.

683
00:52:10,629 --> 00:52:13,465
- That's bullshit.
- I'm telling you what people say.

684
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:15,550
I can put a positive spin on this.

685
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,927
- How?
- How? I'll tell you how.

686
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:20,639
We set up an interview,
get a piece out of it.

687
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,267
You tell the people why you stayed in.
It's for the kid in chemo.

688
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,854
You get public sympathy.
I smell forgiveness in the Bay Area.

689
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:31,399
- Is that exploiting the kid's death?
- Not comfortable with it?

690
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:34,402
- Should I be?
- I think you should be.

691
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:37,989
Well, I don't think I am.

692
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,961
Excuse me. I'll have a vodka
and orange juice, please.

693
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,049
And whatever the lady wants.

694
00:52:56,758 --> 00:52:58,760
Jack on the rocks, thanks.

695
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,431
What?

696
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:10,146
Oh, shit. I did it again, didn't I?

697
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:14,025
No, it's okay.
I'm used to all of this interview shit.

698
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:25,328
Look, no offense intended,
but it's no secret...

699
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:28,748
that you're playing like shit.
It's gotta be affecting you.

700
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,667
Of course it's affecting me.

701
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:33,837
I'm paid to produce.
I can't even hit the side of a barn.

702
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:38,550
- How do you think it makes me feel?
- Do you know what I think, Mr. Rayburn?

703
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,636
No, but I'm quite sure
you're gonna tell me.

704
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,057
I think the slump is a good thing.

705
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:48,435
Now, what kind of twisted shit is that?

706
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,230
It's gonna teach you
to out yourself a little slack.

707
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,692
- You can't keep up this act forever.
- Now it's an act.

708
00:53:56,025 --> 00:54:00,405
Oh, yeah, Mr. Perfect. Mr. No-Error.
Nobody can live up to that shit.

709
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,992
You gotta give yourself a break.
It's just a lie anyhow.

710
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:08,747
Yeah. It doesn't seem like a lie
when I'm hitting.

711
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,959
Now batting for the Giants,
number 11...

712
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:16,129
the right fielder, Juan Primo.

713
00:54:19,132 --> 00:54:21,634
Sit down, let Bobby bat!

714
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:37,901
He's a hot dog. He's lucky.

715
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:45,992
Now batting, number 11, Juan Primo.

716
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:13,561
Now batting, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

717
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:18,399
Let's play some fucking ball!

718
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:21,110
Thanks, Primo.

719
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:30,328
Fuck you, Rayburn.

720
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:41,548
- You suck.
- Bobby, Bobby.

721
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,428
You suck!

722
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,556
Don't listen to them, Bobby!

723
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:35,685
Okay.

724
00:56:40,732 --> 00:56:43,234
Line drive to the right.

725
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,945
Don't tell me
where it's gonna go, Dad.

726
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,978
I wish we had a whole team
like him.

727
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:24,651
Fuckin' asshole!

728
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,701
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Nikki. The usual.

729
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,330
- Alrighty.
- Hey, Bob.

730
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:48,800
You guys wanna play pool?

731
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:51,719
- What a waste of space.
- What do you mean?

732
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:55,223
He hit a bad patch.
We all hit bad patches, don't we?

733
00:57:56,099 --> 00:58:00,019
- You never hit a bad patch?
- No, this is my dream job.

734
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:08,987
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Please, man.

735
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:13,366
These guys come to relax. You bug
them, they're gonna stop coming here.

736
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:16,411
I know him. I've talked to him
on the phone.

737
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:20,123
Hey, Bob.

738
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,337
Can I talk to you for a second?

739
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:30,133
- Sure. You wanna talk to me?
- Maybe we can go someplace.

740
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,719
- Let me finish the game.
- Okay.

741
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,311
Primo, it's late, man. All right?

742
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:45,982
- Tell me what it is you want.
- I want nothing.

743
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:48,985
You don't understand
how things work here.

744
00:58:49,277 --> 00:58:51,779
Because it's different
from where you come from.

745
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,198
What's different?

746
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,827
Look, when a player like me
comes into a team like this...

747
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,121
hey, man, shit gets worked out.

748
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,832
Right? You don't...
What is the problem with that?

749
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:09,130
What kind of uniforms
do you have down there?

750
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,717
- Just uniforms.
- Like these pussy pants you're wearing?

751
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:15,636
- What...? What color?
- Blue.

752
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:19,932
- What number is on the back of yours?
- Eleven.

753
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,937
Primo, what is your price?

754
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:28,983
No price. You already
had a chance, baby. Okay?

755
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:32,361
- What's your fucking price?
- Go fuck yourself.

756
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:36,115
- Hey, don't walk away from me, man.
- Fuck you.

757
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,827
Motherfucker. What?

758
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:47,001
- Break it up!
- Get off of him.

759
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:53,508
- I want my fucking number, man.
- Chill out.

760
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,512
What are we talking about
Juan Primo for...

761
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,016
when we've got Bobby Rayburn where
we want him, up close and exclusive.

762
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,435
Are you ready for your next caller?

763
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:06,312
- Let's get another caller.
- Bobby.

764
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:10,358
- You guys are getting a kick out of this.
- What are you talking about?

765
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:13,861
I'm talking about my season is like
a bad freeway accident.

766
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:16,697
And you guys, you're just
slowing down to watch.

767
01:00:17,073 --> 01:00:20,201
I thought I'd enjoy this,
but the fact is, I feel for you.

768
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,203
I didn't know it'd be so rough.

769
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:26,916
Who we talking to? On the car phone,
we are talking to Gil.

770
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:30,628
Hey, is that our old buddy Gil?
Mr. Magical-Conjunction himself.

771
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,422
- Is this Jewel?
- You're on the air. Go ahead.

772
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,134
You're getting break-up
on the line here.

773
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,929
- I heard what you said about Primo.
- What's your question for Bobby?

774
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,932
Is Bobby listening? Bobby?
Hey, Bob?

775
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,518
Yeah, Gil, I'm here, man.
How you doing?

776
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:49,397
I wanna tell you that I know exactly
what you're going through...

777
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:54,485
more than you'll ever understand.
This number 11 thing is a fucking joke.

778
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:57,572
You're the greatest player
this city's ever had...

779
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,033
and you got some hot-dogger
like Primo...

780
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:03,411
giving you a hard time
about your number.

781
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,538
There's a reason
you're paid 40 million.

782
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,207
The owners aren't doing
what they should be.

783
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:11,002
They should be protecting
their investment.

784
01:01:11,419 --> 01:01:13,337
Pay him. Give him what he wants.

785
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,715
If he wants a million, give it to him.

786
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:19,802
If he doesn't want it and doesn't want
to give up his number, fuck him.

787
01:01:20,136 --> 01:01:23,431
Get him out. What's the difference?
Just get you hitting again.

788
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:27,226
- If that's what it's gonna take.
- They say fans don't know...

789
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:31,689
what they're talking about. The public
and the owners should listen to you.

790
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:34,275
Bobby, why isn't this guy
on your payroll?

791
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:38,863
Thanks, Gil. Maybe I should have you
try and talk some sense into Primo.

792
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,532
God knows I need
all the help I can get.

793
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,121
They say fans don't know
what they're talking about.

794
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:49,832
The public and the owners
should listen to you.

795
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:52,418
Bobby, why isn't this guy
on your payroll?

796
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:56,923
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

797
01:01:57,924 --> 01:02:01,802
The owners should listen to you. Bobby,
why isn't this guy on your payroll?

798
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,640
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

799
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:09,518
Maybe I should have you try
and talk some sense into Primo.

800
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,521
God knows I need all the help
I can get.

801
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:26,702
Primo. Primo, lots of luck.

802
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:28,412
Primo.

803
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,710
Mr. Primo?

804
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:20,715
- Yeah?
- Can I just say...?

805
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:25,636
Did you ever think how one man
who's doing well...

806
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:28,806
might throw off
the rest of the team?

807
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,603
I'm saying, you have to think of
what's best for the team, right?

808
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:38,482
You might have to
lay down a sacrifice.

809
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:41,569
I'm talking about
Bobby Rayburn's number.

810
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:45,823
I don't know if you understand
how much he needs that number.

811
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:48,909
- Number 11.
- I am number 11.

812
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:52,413
I know, but he needs it
more than you.

813
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:03,632
Are you with the press?

814
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,428
You with the hotel?

815
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,811
Then get out of here.

816
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:20,775
Go.

817
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,337
Get the fuck out of here.

818
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:21,228
It's a sad night here at the Stick
as the Giants take the field...

819
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:25,858
for the first time since the murder
of hitting sensation Juan Primo.

820
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:29,278
Rayburn will take his place
in the lineup batting cleanup.

821
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:32,406
There's bound to be questions
about that, Jewel.

822
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:01,018
Now we all get to wear
the number, man.

823
01:07:57,908 --> 01:07:59,827
Come on, let's play ball!

824
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:07,126
Now batting fourth, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

825
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:11,422
Bobby! Come on, Bobby!

826
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,300
Fuck you.

827
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,481
Come on, Bob!

828
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:52,838
That's it.

829
01:09:01,722 --> 01:09:03,223
Come on, Bob!

830
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,809
Attaway. You're back to your old self.

831
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:16,320
Fuck you.

832
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:24,119
This is the last place I'll look.
Then I'll quit.

833
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:27,623
Yeah, no, I've had it. I'm tired.
I mean, he's not here.

834
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:31,627
There he is. I found my man.
I'll talk to you later.

835
01:09:38,217 --> 01:09:41,303
Is this how you celebrate
going four for four, huh?

836
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,431
What happened to pouring
champagne over your head...

837
01:09:44,807 --> 01:09:46,809
and banging some groupies, huh?

838
01:09:48,227 --> 01:09:50,813
Bobby. Bobby, talk to me.

839
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:53,982
If the cops worry you,
they're not interested in you.

840
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:57,277
It's just an ongoing investigation.
Let it go.

841
01:09:57,569 --> 01:09:59,405
I didn't ask for this, man.

842
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:03,033
You talking about Primo?
Come on, I know that's shit.

843
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:07,037
I thought about it a lot,
but I didn't ask for this.

844
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:10,916
You know, Bobsy...

845
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,919
I wish five people dead
on my drive to work.

846
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,922
Five people. But wishing it
doesn't make it so.

847
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:19,717
You're not God,
lifetime average withstanding.

848
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,429
Yeah? Well...

849
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:26,014
why do I feel so bad then, huh?

850
01:10:26,598 --> 01:10:28,016
I don't know.

851
01:10:28,517 --> 01:10:29,810
I don't...

852
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:33,188
This is gonna blow the hell
out of my shithead theory...

853
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,357
but I think you feel guilty.

854
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:37,860
Jesus-hairy-Christ.

855
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:39,820
I've been wrong about you.

856
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:42,698
You're not a shithead at all.
I'm flabbergasted.

857
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,534
Come on, let's go, man.
I got a game tomorrow.

858
01:10:57,838 --> 01:11:01,216
Number 33, Bobby Rayburn.

859
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,098
Go, Bobby! Bobby!

860
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:13,520
Safe.

861
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,819
Bobby Rayburn.

862
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:28,619
You're coming off
the worst slump in your career.

863
01:11:28,911 --> 01:11:33,499
All of a sudden, you're hitting well over
400, 11 home runs, 30 RBis last month.

864
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:35,209
How do you explain this?

865
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:37,336
I wish I knew.

866
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,339
That's it? You wish you knew?

867
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:45,010
A "thank you" would've been nice.

868
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:03,737
Sean!

869
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:06,031
Be careful!

870
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,537
Don't go too far!

871
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,836
Sean, don't go too far, darling.

872
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:22,923
Bradley!

873
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:24,925
Bradley, come here!

874
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:32,015
Bradley, come back.

875
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,273
Go back, Bradley. Go back.

876
01:12:40,274 --> 01:12:43,235
Sean!

877
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,826
Sean!

878
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:54,121
Mr. Rayburn!

879
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,001
Shit.

880
01:13:04,423 --> 01:13:06,008
Mr. Rayburn!

881
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:37,122
Sean!

882
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:10,322
- Thank God for Mark Spitz over here.
- Jeez.

883
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:14,826
Okay. Just relax. Go on.
That's right, blow it out.

884
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:16,536
It's gonna be all right.

885
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:18,121
Are you all right, man?

886
01:14:18,914 --> 01:14:20,999
- Just relax.
- He swallowed some water.

887
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:23,919
Jesus. You scared me half to death.

888
01:14:24,836 --> 01:14:26,129
Where did you come from?

889
01:14:26,338 --> 01:14:30,425
I was just walking on the beach,
I saw him in the water, and I went in.

890
01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:33,512
Thank God, man. You all right?

891
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:37,307
Sean, you gotta promise me,
no matter what...

892
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:39,810
not a word to your mother,
understand?

893
01:14:40,102 --> 01:14:43,563
Next time you're looking
for attention, be more dramatic.

894
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:47,526
- Let's get some dry clothes.
- Play in traffic like the other kids.

895
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:50,028
- That little bonehead.
- Oh, shit.

896
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:56,535
- What did you say your name was?
- My friends call me Curly.

897
01:14:56,702 --> 01:15:01,123
Curly. Well, come on, Curly,
let's go inside.

898
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:05,210
Elvira will get you some
dry clothes, all right?

899
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:10,007
Thank you.

900
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:14,613
- What do I say?
- Well, you know, I was just there.

901
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:16,698
You would've done the same thing.

902
01:16:17,032 --> 01:16:19,910
If I lose this guy, man,
I don't know what I would do.

903
01:16:20,535 --> 01:16:22,412
Looks good on you.

904
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:24,706
I don't know
about them pants, though.

905
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:26,625
They're yours.

906
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,919
- Can I get you anything?
- A beer.

907
01:16:29,211 --> 01:16:33,507
Yeah, all right. I could swear...
Have I seen you before?

908
01:16:33,924 --> 01:16:37,636
I get that all the time.
I got one of those faces, I guess.

909
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:43,016
You like baseball?

910
01:16:43,517 --> 01:16:46,937
I'm not obsessed with it or anything.
Are you a player?

911
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,689
Yeah.

912
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:51,817
- You are?
- Yeah.

913
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:56,029
Barry Bonds?

914
01:16:58,532 --> 01:17:01,618
No. No. I'm Bobby Rayburn.

915
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:03,620
- Right.
- Yeah.

916
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:07,916
- I was just kidding you.
- It's okay.

917
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:12,212
At least you're not one of them
die-hard baseball fans who...

918
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:13,713
Why is that?

919
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:15,715
Because those guys are losers.

920
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:20,262
Aren't the fans what it's all about?

921
01:17:20,512 --> 01:17:23,431
Shit. Tell you something, man.

922
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:27,602
The fans are like women.
When you're hitting, they love you.

923
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:31,523
And when you're not, they'd as soon
spit on you as look at you.

924
01:17:31,857 --> 01:17:33,775
Why is that?

925
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:39,364
Because they don't understand that
you're the same person hitting or not.

926
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,325
You know?

927
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:45,537
Only person you should play for
is yourself.

928
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:53,253
Hey, you wanna shoot some pool?

929
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:55,630
Yeah, sure.

930
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:58,300
- All right. Bring the beer.
- Sure.

931
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:08,059
Curly, Curly...

932
01:18:10,562 --> 01:18:12,022
Curly Otis?

933
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,274
- Yeah, that's my old man.
- No shit.

934
01:18:14,858 --> 01:18:18,278
I was in bigs for a cup of coffee myself
until my arm went south.

935
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:20,655
Man, tough break.

936
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:23,450
It's like my old catcher Coop
used to say:

937
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:26,036
"Enjoy it while you got it,
then move on."

938
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:27,954
Yeah.

939
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:33,460
That's a good philosophy, brother.
Good philosophy.

940
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:39,841
- Are all those hats yours?
- Yep, my pride and joy.

941
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:43,053
- Could I try one on?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

942
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:54,397
Fits.

943
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:56,858
Looks good on you.

944
01:18:59,861 --> 01:19:01,446
Hey, Bobby...

945
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:05,659
did you mean it?
You'd do something for me?

946
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:08,870
Yeah, sure. I mean, within reason,
you know.

947
01:19:09,037 --> 01:19:10,455
Don't be getting no ideas.

948
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,749
- Let me pitch to you.
- What?

949
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:16,962
Let me show you what I got.
I got a couple innings left in me.

950
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:19,965
Come on, Bobby,
let me show you what I got.

951
01:19:21,341 --> 01:19:23,760
Bradley's gonna catch for us.

952
01:19:32,352 --> 01:19:34,437
Must feel good
to be hitting again, huh?

953
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:37,649
Brother, you have no idea.

954
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:41,569
- How did you get out of that slump?
- Say what?

955
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:45,365
Got any idea what got you
out of that slump?

956
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:48,368
You know, Curly...

957
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:51,371
I just stopped caring, man.

958
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:55,542
- What?
- I just stopped caring.

959
01:19:55,875 --> 01:19:57,669
You stopped caring?

960
01:19:57,961 --> 01:19:59,462
What do you mean?

961
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:04,342
All my life I've been working
to be the best.

962
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:07,470
You know?
Trying to be a perfectionist.

963
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:12,642
And I thought about it. That's probably
where I made my mistake.

964
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:18,773
And when Juan Primo died, man, that
completely changed the perspective.

965
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:20,650
I mean...

966
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:23,028
I mean, come on, let's be real here.

967
01:20:23,862 --> 01:20:27,240
What are we doing? We're not
curing cancer, you know?

968
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:29,576
We're playing a game.

969
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,162
That's all it is. It's just a game.

970
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:35,957
So I stopped caring and relaxed...

971
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,752
and I started hitting.

972
01:20:39,169 --> 01:20:40,754
Stopped caring.

973
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:44,758
So that's your fucking insight
into life?

974
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:47,761
Just stop caring.

975
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:56,144
- You're pretty loose now, aren't you?
- Yeah.

976
01:20:57,145 --> 01:21:00,565
All I'm saying is that there's
more to life than just baseball.

977
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,859
Like what? Like your house?

978
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:06,571
Like your big-ass car?
Like your 40-fucking-million?

979
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:11,034
I mean, what the fuck
do you care about?

980
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:14,245
I care about my son.
That's what I care about.

981
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:19,250
I'm sorry. I just hate that attitude,
you stopped caring. I'm sorry.

982
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:21,878
What, do you have a better theory?

983
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:23,755
Yeah.

984
01:21:24,339 --> 01:21:26,049
You got your number back.

985
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:31,346
Curly, my number didn't have
anything to do with it.

986
01:21:49,948 --> 01:21:52,033
It looks good on you.

987
01:21:53,243 --> 01:21:54,661
Thanks.

988
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:03,461
- That's great.
- I still haven't given you my best pitch.

989
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:06,339
- Sure you have.
- No.

990
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:09,551
Okay.

991
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:14,180
Look, Curly, I really want to thank you
for what you did for my son.

992
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:17,851
You know, what do you say?
Let's call it a night?

993
01:22:18,268 --> 01:22:19,561
All right.

994
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:26,651
Come on, admit it. We're alone.

995
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,572
Admit what?

996
01:22:30,864 --> 01:22:33,575
Admit you're hitting
because Primo's not around.

997
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,162
That's a bunch of bullshit.
Come on.

998
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:39,747
It doesn't hurt he's not around.

999
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:42,959
Come on, level with me.

1000
01:22:45,253 --> 01:22:47,046
Level with me.

1001
01:22:47,464 --> 01:22:50,758
Come on, I saved your kid.
You wanna pay me back?

1002
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,679
Be honest with me and tell me
you're a little happy that he's dead.

1003
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:58,975
- Hey.
- No, no. I'm not happy that he's dead.

1004
01:23:00,768 --> 01:23:02,061
Come on.

1005
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:04,772
Curly. Curly, I already told you no.

1006
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,943
No, I am not happy
that he's dead. Okay?

1007
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:13,948
Okay? Can I have my hand back now?

1008
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:15,950
Thanks.

1009
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:24,375
I'm really tired. Really.
I'm going to sleep. Take care.

1010
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:27,045
Simple "thank you"
would have been nice...

1011
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:29,672
for a teammate
who lays down a sacrifice.

1012
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:33,676
Hey, look,
you need a ride or anything?

1013
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:36,262
I got my own wheels. Thanks, Bob.

1014
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:38,348
Good. Bradley, let's go.

1015
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,975
If you need anything,
just call me, all right?

1016
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:43,645
And I'll get back to you.
Okay, bye.

1017
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,022
Take care. Come on, Bradley.

1018
01:23:47,357 --> 01:23:48,942
Hey, Bob?

1019
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:52,028
Bobby. What about the glove, Bob?

1020
01:23:52,362 --> 01:23:53,655
Keep it!

1021
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:37,448
I remember when Mick recorded this.
December '77.

1022
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:40,159
We drove home at dawn.

1023
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,163
Who's Mick?

1024
01:24:44,455 --> 01:24:46,541
A great friend of mine.

1025
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:49,669
- Where we going?
- We're going fishing.

1026
01:24:50,044 --> 01:24:52,380
- Why can't my dad come?
- Your dad could come.

1027
01:24:52,672 --> 01:24:56,050
But he has a big game tomorrow,
and we gotta pick up Coop.

1028
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:02,056
Why are we fishing at night?

1029
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:05,268
Night fishing is best. No boats
to scare the fish away.

1030
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:09,439
We'll sucker them in with a flashlight,
cut them up with this.

1031
01:25:09,856 --> 01:25:11,941
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

1032
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:14,944
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's yours. Take it.

1033
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:18,448
- Well, thanks.
- Just don't cut yourself.

1034
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:49,354
- Hello.
- Hey, Curly.

1035
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,564
Hey, Bobby. Hey.

1036
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:54,150
Say hello to your father.
He's on the phone.

1037
01:25:54,442 --> 01:25:56,277
Hi, Dad. We're going fishing.

1038
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:58,279
That's great. That's great, Sean.

1039
01:25:58,571 --> 01:26:02,241
Listen, Curly, could you
pick up the handset so we could talk?

1040
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:04,369
Sure thing, slugger.

1041
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:08,039
- Yeah.
- Curly, is it raining where you are?

1042
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:11,542
- No, I'm far from the beach.
- Didn't know you'd take the car.

1043
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:15,880
- I thought the kid, he'd like to get away.
- Listen, Curly...

1044
01:26:16,547 --> 01:26:20,051
before you do anything stupid,
I don't think this is a good idea.

1045
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:22,345
You don't think. You're a lucky idiot.

1046
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:24,055
I'm not fucking with you.

1047
01:26:24,347 --> 01:26:26,766
- All right.
- Don't get angry at me, Bob.

1048
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:28,142
' Curly?
Bob?

1049
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:30,520
I just want my son back.

1050
01:26:30,687 --> 01:26:31,771
- Bob?
- What?

1051
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:33,022
- Bobby.
- What?!

1052
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:37,777
Listen to you. You're hanging on every
word I say. This is really something.

1053
01:26:38,027 --> 01:26:40,863
Curly, what do you want?
What do you want from me?

1054
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:47,870
Don't talk back.
You show me some respect.

1055
01:26:48,162 --> 01:26:50,456
Without people like me,
you're nothing.

1056
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:53,751
We're the ones that get you
your 40 million.

1057
01:26:54,544 --> 01:26:58,548
- Look, what do you want?
- What do I want?

1058
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:02,760
I want when they think of you,
they think of me.

1059
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:06,764
Curly, I don't know what the fuck
I did to you to piss you off...

1060
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:09,851
but my son has nothing
to do with this.

1061
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:16,274
Oh, Bobby, it's not what you did to me,
it's what I did for you, number 11.

1062
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,651
- You owe me.
- I owe you what?

1063
01:27:19,652 --> 01:27:21,279
Check your freezer.

1064
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:23,573
I'll hang on.

1065
01:27:24,157 --> 01:27:26,576
- There's a surprise.
- What the f...? Curly.

1066
01:27:26,743 --> 01:27:30,747
- Go ahead, check your freezer.
- All right, I'll check the freezer.

1067
01:27:31,164 --> 01:27:32,957
Curly, don't hang up this phone.

1068
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:35,042
You hear me?

1069
01:27:35,543 --> 01:27:36,753
Oh, my God!

1070
01:27:43,176 --> 01:27:46,179
He finally figures it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

1071
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:48,848
It's really true what they say
about sluggers.

1072
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:51,267
They are really, really stupid.

1073
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:56,564
Well, I'm a pitcher, Bobby.
Pitchers use their brains.

1074
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,540
Come on, Bradley.

1075
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,256
We'll play a joke on him,
so you just play along.

1076
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:24,175
- All right.
- Okay?

1077
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:38,272
Hey, Coop.

1078
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,776
Gil.

1079
01:28:43,152 --> 01:28:45,029
Gil.

1080
01:28:45,446 --> 01:28:47,740
- Gil Renard.
- Yeah.

1081
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:49,742
Gil Renard.

1082
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,370
Yeah, long time no see, Gil.

1083
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:55,957
- This is my son.
- Hi.

1084
01:29:02,046 --> 01:29:03,965
Come on in, fellas.

1085
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:05,758
Go ahead.

1086
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:19,021
Man, that is a kick-ass car.
You done good for yourself.

1087
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:22,441
You never see nothing like that
in the Bronx.

1088
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:25,152
I always thought
you'd be managing by now.

1089
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,363
- Managing?
- Yeah, in the majors.

1090
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:30,867
Nobody calls me Coop anymore,
you sick son of a bitch.

1091
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:35,746
How'd you find me anyway?

1092
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:41,669
I looked you up.

1093
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:46,173
Whose kid is that, really?

1094
01:29:49,343 --> 01:29:52,346
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

1095
01:29:53,472 --> 01:29:56,309
- Bobby Rayburn's.
- Jesus fuck.

1096
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:59,854
Same old fucking Gil. Come on.

1097
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:03,858
Really?

1098
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,970
He'll be on in a minute.

1099
01:30:37,767 --> 01:30:40,061
You'll recognize his voice.

1100
01:30:41,479 --> 01:30:46,275
All right, incoming call. Notify
incoming call. Turn off all radios.

1101
01:30:46,651 --> 01:30:48,027
Okay, this is it.

1102
01:30:49,654 --> 01:30:51,572
Bob.

1103
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:03,376
- Yeah.
- Hey, Bobby, you still up?

1104
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:06,879
- Bad time to be calling, huh?
- I'm up.

1105
01:31:07,171 --> 01:31:12,677
Hey, I hope I'm not calling at a bad time.
Probably got some people over, huh?

1106
01:31:13,177 --> 01:31:16,138
I can't hear you. You'll have to
turn the music down.

1107
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:17,974
Oh, I'm sorry, slugger.

1108
01:31:18,474 --> 01:31:20,518
Curly, I want to talk to Sean.

1109
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:26,857
Sean, he's asleep now, but he's doing
fine. Don't worry about him. He's fine.

1110
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:30,653
- Curly, what do you want?
- I've been thinking it over.

1111
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:34,740
You know, in life, life just...

1112
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:38,244
comes down to one single action.

1113
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:42,456
What do you want?

1114
01:31:43,374 --> 01:31:45,459
I want you to hit a home run
for me, Bob.

1115
01:31:46,752 --> 01:31:48,462
Are you serious?

1116
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:50,840
Remember that kid in chemo...

1117
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:53,759
whose life was unfair to him?

1118
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,847
That's how I'm feeling.
My life has been unfair to me.

1119
01:32:00,057 --> 01:32:04,854
The only difference is, I'll be able to see
you hit that home run tomorrow.

1120
01:32:05,146 --> 01:32:06,439
And I got a photo here.

1121
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:11,861
I'm gonna get it to you. And I want you
to put it on the Jumbotron, okay?

1122
01:32:15,573 --> 01:32:18,951
- Yeah.
- Then I want you to stand up and tell...

1123
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:20,745
the 50 million viewers...

1124
01:32:20,953 --> 01:32:25,374
that this home run
is dedicated to Gil, a true fan.

1125
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,255
- What do you think?
- I can't believe you're serious.

1126
01:32:31,672 --> 01:32:34,175
I'm serious as a heart attack, Bobby.

1127
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,552
That's pretty serious, isn't it?

1128
01:32:38,179 --> 01:32:42,391
There comes a time in everybody's life
when you have to stand for something.

1129
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:45,686
Otherwise, you're just
passing on through.

1130
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:48,022
So, Bobby, I'm watching you.

1131
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:51,650
If that pitcher goes easy on you,
I'll kill your fucking kid.

1132
01:32:54,945 --> 01:32:56,739
Surprise, surprise.

1133
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:59,241
Hey, Bobby.

1134
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:02,244
I'm still here.

1135
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,873
Now do you care?

1136
01:33:23,599 --> 01:33:26,060
You get in some serious shit for that.

1137
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:29,939
Cops are gonna be all over us.

1138
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:34,777
Boy, all of a sudden,
you lost your sense of humor.

1139
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:37,738
- Did you get it?
- Couldn't get him.

1140
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:43,452
He's calling from Rayburn's car. We
should be able to nail him to the district.

1141
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:54,672
You're not gonna believe this kid.
Just like old times, huh, Coop?

1142
01:33:57,967 --> 01:34:01,345
- You know, that's not my real dad.
- It's okay, kid.

1143
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:09,979
Come on, I'm waiting.

1144
01:34:10,646 --> 01:34:12,648
I'm waiting. The signals.

1145
01:34:13,023 --> 01:34:16,026
What happened? Did you forget
everything? Come on, Coop.

1146
01:34:33,169 --> 01:34:34,879
Hang in there, kid.

1147
01:34:37,173 --> 01:34:39,258
Bring the bat up, slugger.

1148
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:42,845
Come on, look like a hitter.
Bring it up.

1149
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:45,347
Bring it up. Come on.

1150
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:49,685
Come on! Come on, slugger,
bring the fucking bat up.

1151
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:51,854
Come on.

1152
01:34:52,855 --> 01:34:54,648
That's my boy.

1153
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:58,777
It's all right, kid, hang in there, now.
Hang in there.

1154
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:11,040
Coop, you dickhead!

1155
01:35:11,165 --> 01:35:13,042
Come on, kid. Come on.

1156
01:35:15,252 --> 01:35:17,546
Go. Go. Up the fence. Come on.

1157
01:35:17,838 --> 01:35:19,340
Come on, push. Push. Go.

1158
01:35:20,049 --> 01:35:23,260
Go. Go on. Go, kid, go.

1159
01:35:24,845 --> 01:35:26,639
Coop, what are you doing?

1160
01:35:34,021 --> 01:35:36,649
Why did you do that?
We could've been teammates.

1161
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:40,444
We were teammates.
We could've made it to the bigs.

1162
01:35:40,653 --> 01:35:42,947
It was Little League.
We were 12 years old.

1163
01:36:14,186 --> 01:36:15,854
Come on.

1164
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:23,779
That's my boy.

1165
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:41,672
Ladies and gentlemen,
leading off the second inning...

1166
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:45,259
Giants center fielder, number 33,
Bobby Rayburn.

1167
01:36:46,969 --> 01:36:49,221
Well, the forecast is for rain tonight.

1168
01:36:49,513 --> 01:36:52,391
There's a mist falling as Rayburn steps
towards the box.

1169
01:36:52,683 --> 01:36:55,686
He's been more aggressive
the last month of the season.

1170
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,479
Who do we have on line two?

1171
01:36:57,646 --> 01:37:01,150
- Just a fan.
- Hey, Mr. Fan, how you doing?

1172
01:37:01,775 --> 01:37:04,570
Wanna say you're lucky to be
in the stadium tonight.

1173
01:37:04,862 --> 01:37:07,031
Really? Why's that?

1174
01:37:08,741 --> 01:37:11,744
- Is that a Giants watch I hear playing?
- Yes, it is.

1175
01:37:12,077 --> 01:37:14,955
- Is that my buddy Gil?
- Maybe.

1176
01:37:15,456 --> 01:37:18,751
This will be one of the most amazing
nights in the game's history.

1177
01:37:20,377 --> 01:37:22,838
- "It will be incredible."
- Really? Why's that, Gil?

1178
01:37:23,172 --> 01:37:25,466
I'm telling you,
the Kirk Gibson homer...

1179
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:29,053
Ripken breaking Gehrig's record,
peanuts compared to tonight.

1180
01:37:29,345 --> 01:37:32,389
You're talking about classic moments
in baseball history.

1181
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:35,059
What's happening tonight
that could top those?

1182
01:37:35,392 --> 01:37:37,061
Let's just say Bobby Rayburn's...

1183
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:39,438
- in for the night of his life.
- Why, Gil?

1184
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:43,567
Well, some people are ungrateful.
They should be taught a lesson.

1185
01:37:45,361 --> 01:37:46,945
Strike!

1186
01:37:52,076 --> 01:37:54,161
Are you calling from
inside the stadium?

1187
01:37:54,453 --> 01:37:57,748
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- Well..."

1188
01:37:58,457 --> 01:38:02,461
You got good seats? Are you behind
first base? Can you see me?

1189
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:04,755
Can I see you?

1190
01:38:05,255 --> 01:38:08,675
Yeah, you're waving right at me.
Have a nice night.

1191
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:12,304
Gil, wait. Before you hang up,
I wanted to ask you a question.

1192
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:15,891
- Trying to trace the call, Jewel?
- What? What was that, Gil?

1193
01:38:16,183 --> 01:38:17,393
You'll never find me.

1194
01:38:19,978 --> 01:38:23,148
- Strike!
- Have a nice night.

1195
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,859
Gil. Fuck!

1196
01:38:26,026 --> 01:38:28,028
Come on, man, go get him!

1197
01:38:28,946 --> 01:38:30,656
Play!

1198
01:38:32,366 --> 01:38:34,243
Yes!

1199
01:38:47,339 --> 01:38:48,674
Shit.

1200
01:38:49,341 --> 01:38:52,344
Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.

1201
01:38:53,345 --> 01:38:55,139
- Did you feel that raindrop?
- What?

1202
01:38:55,431 --> 01:38:57,558
I felt rain.

1203
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:08,444
- The guy's not gonna be crazy enough...
- He's here! The guy's here.

1204
01:39:08,652 --> 01:39:11,947
- He could've been near a radio.
- He's in the stadium.

1205
01:39:14,533 --> 01:39:17,661
Look at that. That is one fine piece
of craftsmanship.

1206
01:39:17,828 --> 01:39:19,580
- What?
- The knife.

1207
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:22,458
It's a first edition. See how it
says "prototype?

1208
01:39:22,624 --> 01:39:25,752
That means it's a collector's piece.

1209
01:39:25,919 --> 01:39:30,257
"Renard & Garrity." It's a local firm,
isn't it? Gilbert Renard?

1210
01:39:41,977 --> 01:39:44,271
What are you waiting for,
a clue, an invite?

1211
01:39:44,688 --> 01:39:48,692
This guy is gonna kill Bobby's kid
if you don't find him in nine innings.

1212
01:39:49,193 --> 01:39:52,779
Ladies and gentlemen, leading off
the bottom of the eighth...

1213
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:55,449
number 33, Bobby Rayburn.

1214
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:59,870
Bobby's as safe as Kennedy was
in Dallas. What are you looking for?

1215
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:03,040
Play!

1216
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,307
Ball one.

1217
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:24,269
- What, are you walking me?
- Consider it a compliment, dickhead.

1218
01:40:24,978 --> 01:40:27,689
Fuck! Do you know what you're
doing to me?!

1219
01:40:28,023 --> 01:40:30,692
- They're giving him first base.
- Throw the pitch!

1220
01:40:31,026 --> 01:40:32,778
Fuck!

1221
01:40:41,286 --> 01:40:42,788
Fuck.

1222
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,874
Oh, man, the ump's gonna
call the game. Oh, my... Fuck.

1223
01:40:47,292 --> 01:40:49,878
Oh, God, please don't do this.
I'm begging you.

1224
01:40:50,295 --> 01:40:51,797
Don't... Throw the pitch.

1225
01:40:51,964 --> 01:40:54,383
For God's sake, listen to me!
Throw the pitch!

1226
01:40:54,675 --> 01:40:56,885
Throw the fucking pitch!

1227
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:01,431
- Do you know what you're doing to me?
- "The umpire has decided..."

1228
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,934
to send both teams
into the dugouts.

1229
01:41:04,226 --> 01:41:06,395
It looks like we've got a rain delay.

1230
01:41:09,273 --> 01:41:12,985
Ladies and gentlemen, the umpire
has called for a rain delay...

1231
01:41:13,277 --> 01:41:17,698
with the Padres
leading the Giants 2 to 1.

1232
01:41:24,288 --> 01:41:28,083
Do you and your dad have a special
place he and you like to go?

1233
01:41:29,084 --> 01:41:31,378
Stadium in the Sky's
our Little League park.

1234
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:34,798
My dad used to play there
when he was a kid.

1235
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:38,468
Is my daddy in trouble?

1236
01:41:57,487 --> 01:41:58,780
Ladies and gentlemen...

1237
01:41:58,989 --> 01:42:02,701
we resume play with the Giants
batting in the bottom of the eighth.

1238
01:42:03,493 --> 01:42:07,372
Proceed to Little League park
Stadium in the Sky, 24th and Sanchez.

1239
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:09,875
We pick it up in the eighth inning...

1240
01:42:10,167 --> 01:42:12,294
on what might be Rayburn's
last at-bat.

1241
01:42:12,586 --> 01:42:14,296
They'll play on this wet field.

1242
01:42:14,588 --> 01:42:17,966
The cold night air is getting
to everybody. Look at Rayburn.

1243
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,428
He's going to the mound to have
a chat with Martinez.

1244
01:42:23,221 --> 01:42:26,308
- Oh, shit.
- I don't give a fuck what he tells you.

1245
01:42:26,725 --> 01:42:29,770
Throw the ball over the plate,
or I'll break your head in.

1246
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:31,897
- Fuck you.
- You hear me?

1247
01:42:33,899 --> 01:42:37,277
This may go back to when Martinez
pitched for Pittsburgh.

1248
01:42:37,861 --> 01:42:40,781
He drilled Rayburn in his back
with a fastball.

1249
01:42:40,989 --> 01:42:42,991
We are seeing it all tonight, Rick.

1250
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:49,289
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- First pitch is at your head, buddy.

1251
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:51,375
Come on, man, do this! Do this!

1252
01:42:57,381 --> 01:43:01,385
A critical at-bat for Rayburn,
the $40 million San Francisco Giant.

1253
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,304
Probably his last chance
to get the Giants even.

1254
01:43:04,721 --> 01:43:08,517
Here in the bottom of the eighth,
the Giants trail 2 to 1.

1255
01:43:12,979 --> 01:43:15,899
- Swung on. Strike one.
- Strike!

1256
01:43:18,485 --> 01:43:21,279
All right, come on!
Come on, Bobby!

1257
01:43:38,964 --> 01:43:42,134
Swung on and missed. Strike two.
Rayburn in the hole.

1258
01:43:42,426 --> 01:43:46,513
One strike left
for Bobby Rayburn tonight.

1259
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:49,224
Jesus Christ, man.

1260
01:43:55,772 --> 01:43:59,484
Air Seven copy. Proceeding
to Stadium in the Sky. Over.

1261
01:44:01,361 --> 01:44:03,989
- Man.
- They're gonna call the game.

1262
01:44:04,281 --> 01:44:06,575
They're gonna call this fucking game.

1263
01:44:33,518 --> 01:44:35,479
Two and two. Two balls, two strikes.

1264
01:44:35,771 --> 01:44:39,024
And Rayburn down to his last strike.

1265
01:44:40,025 --> 01:44:42,569
Bobby knows he's had
two pitches to drive there.

1266
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:45,989
Now at 2-2, you're not gonna
get another good pitch to hit.

1267
01:44:46,281 --> 01:44:49,659
Maybe, since it's damp, he's having
trouble holding the ball.

1268
01:44:50,076 --> 01:44:52,162
This game could be called
at any second.

1269
01:45:10,931 --> 01:45:13,433
Play ball!

1270
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,028
San Diego protecting
its one-run lead.

1271
01:45:25,278 --> 01:45:28,073
Martinez readies, steadies
and delivers to...

1272
01:45:28,365 --> 01:45:30,700
Rayburn drives it deep
to right center field!

1273
01:45:31,368 --> 01:45:32,994
' Yes!

1274
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:39,584
- Run!
- Home run!

1275
01:45:39,876 --> 01:45:43,380
It's off the wall. Rayburn could get
three if he hustles.

1276
01:45:43,672 --> 01:45:46,883
Robinson having trouble
just getting to the ball.

1277
01:45:47,217 --> 01:45:50,136
Rayburn, rounding second,
headed for third.

1278
01:45:50,303 --> 01:45:54,307
He ran through the stop sign. It could
be an inside-the-park home run!

1279
01:45:54,641 --> 01:45:58,687
The relay from Parker!
Rayburn slides, headfirst!

1280
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,480
And he is...

1281
01:46:00,772 --> 01:46:01,982
in there!

1282
01:46:02,774 --> 01:46:03,900
Yes!

1283
01:46:04,192 --> 01:46:05,485
You're out!

1284
01:46:05,861 --> 01:46:08,196
What is that?

1285
01:46:08,697 --> 01:46:09,990
Bad fucking call, man!

1286
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:13,076
- You're out! Sit down!
- No, no, no.

1287
01:46:13,493 --> 01:46:15,287
I beat it by a fucking mile!

1288
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:20,166
You're out. You're questioning my call'?
Sit down! You're out! Sit down!

1289
01:46:25,171 --> 01:46:28,133
You're the fucking guy!
He's the fucking guy!

1290
01:46:30,427 --> 01:46:31,720
It's the umpire!

1291
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,077
What the fuck is that?

1292
01:46:57,162 --> 01:46:58,997
This way! Break it open!

1293
01:47:01,374 --> 01:47:04,878
- Shit.
- What the hell's going on?

1294
01:47:09,758 --> 01:47:13,511
Okay, okay.
I just want my kid back.

1295
01:47:13,887 --> 01:47:17,015
Batter up, Bobby.
I waited a long time for this.

1296
01:47:18,058 --> 01:47:21,269
No, no, no, wait.
No. Okay, look.

1297
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:25,440
- Where's Sean?
- Where do you think he is?

1298
01:47:25,857 --> 01:47:28,026
Come on, where is my son?

1299
01:47:28,652 --> 01:47:31,655
Where's...? Bobby,
where's my home run?

1300
01:47:32,072 --> 01:47:35,742
What?! Curly. Curly.
Where's my son?!

1301
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:39,663
Where is he?
I don't know.

1302
01:47:40,956 --> 01:47:43,166
I guess he's in that big stadium
in the sky.

1303
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:46,670
I'm telling you, Curly,
if you hurt my fucking kid...

1304
01:47:46,962 --> 01:47:53,009
I swear to God I'll kill you!
Bobby. Bobby. Be nice, Bob.

1305
01:47:56,054 --> 01:47:58,181
What do you want from me?

1306
01:48:01,518 --> 01:48:04,854
I don't want anything.
I just want you to...

1307
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:12,570
- I never showed you my best pitch.
- Curly!

1308
01:48:30,255 --> 01:48:32,298
Curly!

1309
01:48:36,011 --> 01:48:38,221
Freeze!

1310
01:48:44,352 --> 01:48:46,980
No, no, don't shoot!
He's got my son.

1311
01:48:48,023 --> 01:48:49,357
Now do you care?

1312
01:48:51,568 --> 01:48:53,653
Bobby, now do you care?

1313
01:48:56,156 --> 01:48:58,158
Just a little bit?

1314
01:49:03,455 --> 01:49:05,248
Curly, don't!

1315
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:31,775
Curly, where's my son?

1316
01:49:32,859 --> 01:49:36,571
Where's Sean, Curly?
Where's my son?

1317
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:40,658
A simple "thank you"
would have been nice.

1318
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:43,578
Where's my son?

1319
01:49:45,455 --> 01:49:47,957
Curly, where's my son?!

1320
01:49:54,756 --> 01:49:58,176
There she is,
site of the old stadium.

1321
01:50:02,806 --> 01:50:04,390
Sean!

1322
01:50:06,184 --> 01:50:08,019
Sean!

1323
01:50:14,025 --> 01:50:16,361
Sean!

1324
01:50:21,574 --> 01:50:23,576
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1325
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:26,162
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Dad.

1326
01:50:26,454 --> 01:50:29,666
I got him!

1327
01:50:45,181 --> 01:50:48,601
What you are seeing here
is a sad turn of events indeed.

1328
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:51,020
Gil Renard, an unemployed
knife salesman...

1329
01:50:51,271 --> 01:50:54,357
was shot to death by the police
during tonight's game.

1330
01:50:54,774 --> 01:50:57,652
Here's how it happened.
Bobby Rayburn...
