500
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,567
It's from them.
Who?

501
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,167
Screwdriver?
I'm good, baby.

502
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:40,400
Take it away?
Yeah, I'm good.

Did he take it?

504

Hematoma. It's a bleeding

585

Fortunately, we were able
to successfully drain it.

So I'm gonna be okay?

587
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,501
You sustained
some pretty heavy trauma,

Three days.

606
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,267

Thanks, doc.

Hey, Paul.
How you doing?

614
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,534
I'm from Midtown South.
I, uh,

615
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,467
just got a few questions
for you about what happened
the other night.

616
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:17,901
So, uh...

617
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,734
...h-how does this...
Well, it's pretty simple.

618
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:25,367
You, uh, tell us
everything that happened,

619
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:27,400
and then we, uh, we nail
the son of a bitch.

620
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:28,567
Put him in jail?

621
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:29,767
That's the idea.

622
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:36,100
How much time could he get?

623
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,567
Aggravated assault,
maybe three to five.

624
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,434
A-Aggravated assault?
That's what it would be.

625
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,767
No, it really depends
on what he did. So why
don't you just tell me

626
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:45,868
what he did,
and we'll take it
from there.

627
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,100
He, uh...

628
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:56,434
Now, look, let's, uh,
let's keep it simple.

629
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,434
Why don't you, uh,
start at the beginning.

630
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,000
Tell me where you
first saw Quantrell.

631
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:03,067

I first, uh...

632
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:06,167
Um...

633
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,834
I just-- I just don't know
how...reliable...

634
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,701
I'll tell you what.

635
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:23,934
You've been through a lot.

636
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,801
So, uh...you get some rest.

637
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,434
We can try this again
in a couple days.

638
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:30,033
That'd be good.
Great.

639
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
That'd be good.
I'm sure it'll start
to come back to you.

No, I hope so,
yeah. I hope so.

My brother's
living in a palace.
Hello.

670
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:16,901
Not too bad,
not too bad.
Nice TV set...

671
00:34:16,968 --> 00:34:18,801
All right.
Look at you.
Better than I thought.

672
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:21,734
You should get the shit
kicked out of you more often.

673
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:23,200
Jeffrey.

674
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:25,634
Speaking of which,
I've been thinking.

675
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:28,033
Oh...oh. [laughing]
That's never good!

676
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,501
What this animal did to you,
he's gotta pay.

677
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,734
Yeah. I'm-- I'm sure he will.

678
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:33,067
Well,
let's make sure of it.

679
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,067
Well, the cops
are investigating.
So?

680
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:37,701
So he's gonna go to jail!
Jail's bullshit.

681
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:39,367
We gotta hit him
where it hurts--
in his wallet.

682
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:42,501
I don't wanna be
one of those assholes
that sues Burger King

683
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:44,667
for 50 billion because
their Whopper's too hot.

684
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:47,000
We are not talking about
Whoppers here, Paul.

685
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:50,767
We are talking about a rich,
spoiled, millionaire athlete

686
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:53,934
who viciously beat
an innocent man within
an inch of his life.

687
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,901
Do you not think,
we, as a society,
have an obligation

688
00:34:56,968 --> 00:34:58,567
to hold its celebrities
to the same--
What's that thing

689
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:01,100
where instead of saying
"won't," you say "will not"?

690
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,634
Or instead of saying
"can't," you say "cannot"?

691
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,234
Contractions?

692
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,133
You stop using them
whenever you want
to sound smart

693
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,767
or lawyerly--
Don't be a fuckin' wise ass,
Paul! This is serious!

694
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:13,133
You should
listen to him.

695
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,267
You don't care about justice.
You just want money.

696
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:18,167
Money isjustice.
We're talking aggravated
assault and battery--

697
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:19,534
3, 4 million easy.

698
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:22,234
Wow. So now you're
a lawyer. That's--

699
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,667
Boy, the things they teach
in secretary school.
Fuck you!

700
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:27,033
He don't give
a shit about you.
But I don't wanna sue.

701
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,567
What the fuck's
wrong with you?
That's enough.

702
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,100
Thickheaded motherfucker,
you are.

703
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,767
What is wrong with you?
This motherfucker

704
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,601
does not give
a fuck about you.

705
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,200
He is in his mansion
playing his Xbox.
You never listen.

706
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,701
That's because no one
ever says anything
worth listening to.

707
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,133
Look at
where you are!
This is a hospital.

708
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,300
It's not what you want.
It's what is right.

709
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,634
You wanna live like this
for the rest of your life?

710
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:44,501
Yes, I do. I wanna
live exactly like this.

711

991

a chance of catching us

be able to play.

01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:07,334
 <i>* Sweet revenge *</i>

1640
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:10,534
 <i>* Without fail *</i>

1641
01:26:10,601 --> 01:26:13,367
 <i>* I caught an aisle seat</i>
 <i>on a plane *</i>

1642
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:16,067
 <i>* And drove</i>
 <i>an English teacher</i>
 <i>half insane *</i>

1643
01:26:16,133 --> 01:26:18,901
 <i>* Makin' up jokes</i>
 <i>about bicycle spokes *</i>

1644
01:26:18,968 --> 01:26:22,067
 <i>* And red balloons *</i>

1645
01:26:22,133 --> 01:26:24,868
 <i>* So I called</i>
 <i>on my local deejay *</i>

1646
01:26:24,934 --> 01:26:27,901
 <i>* And he didn't have</i>
 <i>a lot to say *</i>

1647
01:26:27,968 --> 01:26:29,334
 <i>* But the radio *</i>

1648
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,467
 <i>* Has learned</i>
 <i>all my favorite tunes *</i>

1649
01:26:33,534 --> 01:26:34,901
 <i>* Take it back *</i>

1650
01:26:34,968 --> 01:26:36,501
 <i>* Take it back *</i>

1651
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:39,267
 <i>* Oh, no, you</i>
 <i>can't say that *</i>

1652
01:26:39,334 --> 01:26:40,701
 <i>* All of my friends *</i>

1653
01:26:40,767 --> 01:26:42,167
 <i>* Are not dead *</i>

1654
01:26:42,234 --> 01:26:45,434
 <i>* Or in jail *</i>

1655
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:48,167
 <i>* Through rock</i>
 <i>and through stone *</i>

1656
01:26:48,234 --> 01:26:50,701
 <i>* The black wind still moans *</i>

1657
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:52,234
 <i>* Sweet revenge *</i>

1658
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,667
 <i>* Sweet revenge *</i>

1659
01:26:53,734 --> 01:26:57,133
 <i>* Without fail *</i>

1660
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,701
 <i>* The white meat</i>
 <i>is</i> on the run *

1661
01:26:59,767 --> 01:27:02,801
 <i>* And the dark meat</i>
 <i>is far too done *</i>

1662
01:27:02,868 --> 01:27:05,334
 <i>* And the milkman</i>
 <i>left me a note *</i>

1663
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,868
 <i>* Yesterday *</i>

1664
01:27:06,934 --> 01:27:08,834
 <i>* Yesterday *</i>

1665
01:27:08,901 --> 01:27:10,901
 <i>* Get outta this town</i>
 <i>by noon *</i>

1666
01:27:10,968 --> 01:27:11,901
 <i>* Get out! *</i>

1667
01:27:11,968 --> 01:27:12,901
 <i>* You're comin' on *</i>

1668
01:27:12,968 --> 01:27:13,901
 <i>* Way too soon *</i>

1669
01:27:13,968 --> 01:27:14,901
 <i>* Right now *</i>

1670
01:27:14,968 --> 01:27:15,901
 <i>* And besides that *</i>

1671
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,100
 <i>* We never liked you *</i>

1672
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:19,834
 <i>* Anyway *</i>

1673
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,367
 <i>* Take it back *</i>

1674
01:27:21,434 --> 01:27:22,934
 <i>* Take it back *</i>

1675
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,834
 <i>* Oh, no, you</i>
 <i>can't say that *</i>

1676

 <i>* All of my friends *</i>

1677
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,601
 <i>* Are not dead *</i>

1678

 <i>* Or in jail *</i>

1679
01:27:31,968 --> 01:27:34,667
 <i>* Through rock</i>
 <i>and through stone *</i>

1680
01:27:34,734 --> 01:27:37,200
 <i>* The black wind still moans *</i>

1681
01:27:37,267 --> 01:27:38,601
 <i>* Sweet revenge *</i>

1682
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,067
 <i>* Sweet revenge *</i>

1683
