1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Nikki. The usual.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,600
- Alrighty.
- Hey, Bob.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,100
You guys wanna play pool?

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,000
- What a waste of space.
- What do you mean?

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,500
He hit a bad patch.
We all hit bad patches, don't we?

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,300
- You never hit a bad patch?
- No, this is my dream job.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,300
- I'm gonna talk to him.
- Please, man.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,700
These guys come to relax. You bug
them, they're gonna stop coming here.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,700
I know him. I've talked to him
on the phone.

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,400
Hey, Bob.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
Can I talk to you for a second?

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,400
- Sure. You wanna talk to me?
- Maybe we can go someplace.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
- Let me finish the game.
- Okay.

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,600
Primo, it's late, man. All right?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,300
- Tell me what it is you want.
- I want nothing.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,300
You don't understand
how things work here.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,100
Because it's different
from where you come from.

18
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,500
What's different?

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,100
Look, when a player like me
comes into a team like this...

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
...hey, man, shit gets worked out.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,100
Right? You don't...
What is the problem with that?

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,400
What kind of uniforms
do you have down there?

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,000
- Just uniforms.
- Like these pussy pants you're wearing?

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,900
- What...? What colour?
- Blue.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
- What number is on the backof yours?
- Eleven.

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,200
Primo, what is your price?

27
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,300
No price. You already
had a chance, baby. Okay?

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,700
- What's your fucking price?
- Go fuck yourself.

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,400
- Hey, don't walk away from me, man.
- Fuck you.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,100
Motherfucker. What?

31
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,300
- Break it up!
- Get off of him.

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,800
- I want my fucking number, man.
- Chill out.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,800
What are we talking about
Juan Primo for...

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,300
...when we've got Bobby Rayburn where
we want him, up close and exclusive.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,700
Are you ready for your next caller?

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
- Let's get another caller.
- Bobby.

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,700
- You guys are getting a kickout of this.
- What are you talking about?

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,200
I'm talking about my season is like
a bad freeway accident.

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,000
And you guys, you're just
slowing down to watch.

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,500
I thought I'd enjoy this,
but the fact is, I feel for you.

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,500
I didn't know it'd be so rough.

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,200
Who we talking to? On the car phone,
we are talking to Gil.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,900
Hey, is that our old buddy Gil?
Mr. Magical-Conjunction himself.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,700
- Is this Jewel?
- You're on the air. Go ahead.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,400
{y:i}You're getting break-up
{y:i}on the line here.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,200
- I heard what you said about Primo.
- What's your question for Bobby?

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,200
Is Bobby listening? Bobby?
Hey, Bob?

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,800
Yeah, Gil, I'm here, man.
How you doing?

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,700
I wanna tell you that I know exactly
what you're going through...

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,800
...more than you'll ever understand.
This number 11 thing is a fucking joke.

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,900
You're the greatest player
this city's ever had...

52
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,300
...and you got some hot-dogger
like Primo...

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
...giving you a hard time
about your number.

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,800
There's a reason
you're paid 40 million.

55
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,500
The owners aren't doing
what they should be.

56
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,300
They should be protecting
their investment.

57
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,600
{y:i}Pay him. Give him what he wants.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
If he wants a million, give it to him.

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,100
If he doesn't want it and doesn't want
to give up his number, fuck him.

60
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,700
Get him out. What's the difference?
Just get you hitting again.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,500
- Lf that's what it's gonna take.
- They say fans don't know...

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,000
...what they're talking about. The public
and the owners should listen to you.

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,600
Bobby, why isn't this guy
on your payroll?

64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,200
Thanks, Gil. Maybe I should have you
try and talk some sense into Primo.

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
{y:i}God knows I need
{y:i}all the help I can get.

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,400
{y:i}They say fans don't know
{y:i}what they're talking about.

67
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,100
{y:i}The public and the owners
{y:i}should listen to you.

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,700
{y:i}Bobby, why isn't this guy
{y:i}on your payroll?

69
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,200
{y:i}Maybe I should have you try
{y:i}and talk some sense into Primo.

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,100
{y:i}The owners should listen to you. Bobby,
{y:i}why isn't this guy on your payroll?

71
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,900
{y:i}Maybe I should have you try
{y:i}and talk some sense into Primo.

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,800
{y:i}Maybe I should have you try
{y:i}and talk some sense into Primo.

73
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,800
{y:i}God knows I need all the help
{y:i}I can get.

74
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,000
Primo. Primo, lots of luck.

75
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,700
Primo.

76
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Mr. Primo?

77
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,000
- Yeah?
- Can I just say...?

78
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,900
Did you ever think how one man
who's doing well...

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,100
...might throw off
the rest of the team?

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm saying, you have to thinkof
what's best for the team, right?

81
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,800
You might have to
lay down a sacrifice.

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,900
I'm talking about
Bobby Rayburn's number.

83
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,100
I don't know if you understand
how much he needs that number.

84
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,200
- Number 11.
- I am number 11.

85
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,700
I know, but he needs it
more than you.

86
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,900
Are you with the press?

87
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,700
You with the hotel?

88
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,100
Then get out of here.

89
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,100
Go.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Get the fuckout of here.

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,500
{y:i}It's a sad night here at the Stick
{y:i}as the Giants tak e the field...

92
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,200
{y:i}... for the first time since the murder
{y:i}of hitting sensation Juan Primo.

93
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Rayburn will take his place
in the lineup batting cleanup.

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,700
{y:i}There's bound to be questions
{y:i}about that, Jewel.

95
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,300
Now we all get to wear
the number, man.

96
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,100
Come on, let's play ball!

97
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,400
{y:i}Now batting fourth, number 33,
{y:i}Bobby Rayburn.

98
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Bobby! Come on, Bobby!

99
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,600
Fuck you.

100
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Come on, Bob!

101
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
That's it.

102
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,500
Come on, Bob!

103
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,100
Attaway. You're back to your old self.

104
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
Fuck you.

105
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
This is the last place I'll look.
Then I'll quit.

106
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,900
Yeah, no, I've had it. I'm tired.
I mean, he's not here.

107
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,900
There he is. I found my man.
I'll talk to you later.

108
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,600
Is this how you celebrate
going four for four, huh?

109
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,700
What happened to pouring
champagne over your head...

110
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
...and banging some groupies, huh?

111
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,100
Bobby. Bobby, talk to me.

112
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,300
If the cops worry you,
they're not interested in you.

113
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,600
It's just an ongoing investigation.
Let it go.

114
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,700
I didn't ask for this, man.

115
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,300
You talking about Primo?
Come on, I know that's shit.

116
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,300
I thought about it a lot,
but I didn't ask for this.

117
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,200
You know, Bobsy...

118
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,200
...I wish five people dead
on my drive to work.

119
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,200
Five people. But wishing it
doesn't make it so.

120
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,000
You're not God,
lifetime average withstanding.

121
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,700
Yeah? Well...

122
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
...why do I feel so bad then, huh?

123
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,300
I don't know.

124
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,100
I don't...

125
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
This is gonna blow the hell
out of my shithead theory...

126
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,700
...but I think you feel guilty.

127
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
Jesus-hairy-Christ.

128
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
I've been wrong about you.

129
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,000
You're not a shithead at all.
I'm flabbergasted.

130
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,800
Come on, let's go, man.
I got a game tomorrow.

131
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,500
{y:i}Number 33, Bobby Rayburn.

132
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,400
Go, Bobby! Bobby!

133
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,800
Safe.

134
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,100
{y:i}Bobby Rayburn.

135
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,900
{y:i}You're coming off
{y:i}the worst slump in your career.

136
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,800
{y:i}All of a sudden, you're hitting well over
{y:i}.400, 11 home runs, 30 RBIs last month.

137
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,500
{y:i}How do you explain this?

138
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,600
{y:i}I wish I knew.

139
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,600
That's it? You wish you knew?

140
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,300
A "thank you" would've been nice.

141
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,000
Sean!

142
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,300
Be careful!

143
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Don't go too far!

144
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,100
Sean, don't go too far, darling.

145
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
Bradley!

146
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,200
Bradley, come here!

147
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,300
Bradley, come back.

148
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,600
Go back, Bradley. Go back.

149
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,500
Sean!

150
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,100
Sean!

151
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Mr. Rayburn!

152
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,300
Shit.

153
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,300
Mr. Rayburn!

154
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,400
Sean!

155
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
- Thank God for Mark Spitz over here.
- Jeez.

156
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Okay. Just relax. Go on.
That's right, blow it out.

157
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,600
It's gonna be all right.

158
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,200
Are you all right, man?

159
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,100
- Just relax.
- He swallowed some water.

160
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Jesus. You scared me half to death.

161
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,200
Where did you come from?

162
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,500
I was just walking on the beach,
I saw him in the water, and I went in.

163
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,600
Thank God, man. You all right?

164
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,400
Sean, you gotta promise me,
no matter what...

165
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,900
...not a word to your mother,
understand?

166
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,700
Next time you're looking
for attention, be more dramatic.

167
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,600
- Let's get some dry clothes.
- Play in traffic like the other kids.

168
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,100
- That little bonehead.
- Oh, shit.

169
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,600
- What did you say your name was?
- My friends call me Curly.

170
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,200
Curly. Well, come on, Curly,
let's go inside.

171
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,300
Elvira will get you some
dry clothes, all right?

172
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,100
Thank you.

173
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,700
- What do I say?
- Well, you know, I was just there.

174
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,800
You would've done the same thing.

175
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,000
If I lose this guy, man,
I don't know what I would do.

176
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,500
Looks good on you.

177
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,800
I don't know
about them pants, though.

178
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,700
They're yours.

179
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
- Can I get you anything?
- A beer.

180
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,600
Yeah, all right. I could swear...
Have I seen you before?

181
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,700
I get that all the time.
I got one of those faces, I guess.

182
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,100
You like baseball?

183
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm not obsessed with it or anything.
Are you a player?

184
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah.

185
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,900
- You are?
- Yeah.

186
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,100
Barry Bonds?

187
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,700
No. No. I'm Bobby Rayburn.

188
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,700
- Right.
- Yeah.

189
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
- I was just kidding you.
- It's okay.

190
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,300
At least you're not one of them
die- hard baseball fans who...

191
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,800
Why is that?

192
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,800
Because those guys are losers.

193
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Aren't the fans what it's all about?

194
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,500
Shit. Tell you something, man.

195
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,700
The fans are like women.
When you're hitting, they love you.

196
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,600
And when you're not, they'd as soon
spit on you as look at you.

197
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,800
Why is that?

198
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,400
Because they don't understand that
you're the same person hitting or not.

199
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,400
You know?

200
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,600
Only person you should play for
is yourself.

201
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,300
Hey, you wanna shoot some pool?

202
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,700
Yeah, sure.

203
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,400
- All right. Bring the beer.
- Sure.

204
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,100
Curly, Curly"..."

205
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,100
Curly Otis?

206
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
- Yeah, that's my old man.
- No shit.

207
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,300
I was in bigs for a cup of coffee myself
until my arm went south.

208
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Man, tough break.

209
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,500
It's like my old catcher Coop
used to say:

210
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,100
"Enjoy it while you got it,
then move on."

211
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah.

212
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,500
That's a good philosophy, brother.
Good philosophy.

213
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,900
- Are all those hats yours?
- Yep, my pride and joy.

214
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,100
- Could I try one on?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

215
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,500
Fits.

216
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Looks good on you.

217
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,500
Hey, Bobby...

218
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,700
...did you mean it?
You'd do something for me?

219
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Yeah, sure. I mean, within reason,
you know.

220
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,500
Don't be getting no ideas.

221
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,800
- Let me pitch to you.
- What?

222
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let me show you what I got.
I got a couple innings left in me.

223
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,000
Come on, Bobby,
let me show you what I got.

224
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,800
Bradley's gonna catch for us.

225
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,500
Must feel good
to be hitting again, huh?

226
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,700
Brother, you have no idea.

227
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,600
- How did you get out of that slump?
- Say what?

228
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Got any idea what got you
out of that slump?

229
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
You know, Curly...

230
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,400
...I just stopped caring, man.

231
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,600
- What?
- I just stopped caring.

232
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,700
You stopped caring?

233
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,500
What do you mean?

234
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,400
All my life I've been working
to be the best.

235
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,500
You know?
Trying to be a perfectionist.

236
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,700
And I thought about it. That's probably
where I made my mistake.

237
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,800
And when Juan Primo died, man, that
completely changed the perspective.

238
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,700
I mean"..."

239
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,100
I mean, come on, let's be real here.

240
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,300
What are we doing? We're not
curing cancer, you know?

241
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,600
We're playing a game.

242
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
That's all it is. It's just a game.

243
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,000
So I stopped caring and relaxed...

244
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
...and I started hitting.

245
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,800
Stopped caring.

246
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,800
So that's your fucking insight
into life?

247
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
Just stop caring.

248
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,200
- You're pretty loose now, aren't you?
- Yeah.

249
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,600
All I'm saying is that there's
more to life than just baseball.

250
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,900
Like what? Like your house?

251
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,600
Like your bigass car?
Like your 40-fucking-million?

252
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,100
I mean, what the fuck
do you care about?

253
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,300
I care about my son.
That's what I care about.

254
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,300
I'm sorry. I just hate that attitude,
you stopped caring. I'm sorry.

255
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,900
What, do you have a better theory?

256
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,800
Yeah.

257
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,100
You got your number back.

258
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Curly, my number didn't have
anything to do with it.

259
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,100
It looks good on you.

260
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,700
Thanks.

261
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,500
- That's great.
- I still haven't given you my best pitch.

262
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,400
- Sure you have.
- No.

263
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
Okay.

264
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,200
Look, Curly, I really want to thank you
for what you did for my son.

265
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,900
You know, what do you say?
Let's call it a night?

266
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,600
All right.

267
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,700
Come on, admit it. We're alone.

268
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,600
Admit what?

269
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,600
Admit you're hitting
because Primo's not around.

270
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,200
That's a bunch of bullshit.
Come on.

271
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,800
It doesn't hurt he's not around.

272
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Come on, level with me.

273
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,100
Level with me.

274
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,800
Come on, I saved your kid.
You wanna pay me back?

275
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,700
Be honest with me and tell me
you're a little happy that he's dead.

276
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,000
- Hey.
- No, no. I'm not happy that he's dead.

277
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,100
Come on.

278
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,800
Curly. Curly, I already told you no.

279
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,000
No, I am not happy
that he's dead. Okay?

280
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay? Can I have my hand back now?

281
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,000
Thanks.

282
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm really tired. Really.
I'm going to sleep. Take care.

283
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,100
Simple "thank you"
would have been nic"e..."

284
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,700
...for a teammate
who lays down a sacrifice.

285
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,700
Hey, look,
you need a ride or anything?

286
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,300
I got my own wheels. Thanks, Bob.

287
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,400
Good. Bradley, let's go.

288
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,000
If you need anything,
just call me, all right?

289
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,700
And I'll get back to you.
Okay, bye.

290
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,100
Take care. Come on, Bradley.

291
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,000
Hey, Bob?

292
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,100
Bobby. What about the glove, Bob?

293
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,700
Keep it!

294
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,500
I remember when Mick recorded this.
December '77.

295
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
We drove home at dawn.

296
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
Who's Mick?

297
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,600
A great friend of mine.

298
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,700
- Where we going?
- We're going fishing.

299
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,400
- Why can't my dad come?
- Your dad could come.

300
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,100
But he has a big game tomorrow,
and we gotta pick up Coop.

301
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,100
Why are we fishing at night?

302
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,300
Night fishing is best. No boats
to scare the fish away.

303
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,500
We'll sucker them in with a flashlight,
cut them up with this.

304
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,000
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

305
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,000
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's yours. Take it.

306
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,500
- Well, thanks.
- Just don't cut yourself.

307
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,400
- Hello.
- Hey, Curly.

308
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,600
Hey, Bobby. Hey.

309
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,200
Say hello to your father.
He's on the phone.

310
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,300
Hi, Dad. We're going fishing.

311
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,300
That's great. That's great, Sean.

312
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,300
Listen, Curly, could you
pick up the handset so we could talk?

313
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,400
Sure thing, slugger.

314
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,100
- Yeah.
- Curly, is it raining where you are?

315
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,600
- No, I'm far from the beach.
- Didn't know you'd take the car.

316
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,900
- I thought the kid, he'd like to get away.
{y:i}- Listen, Curly...

317
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,100
...before you do anything stupid,
I don't think this is a good idea.

318
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
You don't think. You're a lucky idiot.

319
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,100
I'm not fucking with you.

320
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,800
- All right.
- Don't get angry at me, Bob.

321
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,200
- Curly?
- Bob?

322
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,500
I just want my son back.

323
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,800
- Bob?
- What?

324
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
- Bobby.
- What?!

325
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,800
Listen to you. You're hanging on every
word I say. This is really something.

326
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,900
Curly, what do you want?
What do you want from me?

327
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,900
Don't talk back.
You show me some respect.

328
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,500
Without people like me,
you're nothing.

329
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,800
We're the ones that get you
your 40 million.

330
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
- Look, what do you want?
- What do I want?

331
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,800
I want when they thinkof you,
they thinkof me.

332
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,800
Curly, I don't know what the fuck
I did to you to piss you off...

333
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,900
...but my son has nothing
to do with this.

334
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:45,300
Oh, Bobby, it's not what you did to me,
it's what I did for you, number 11.

335
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
- You owe me.
- I owe you what?

336
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,300
Check your freezer.

337
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,600
I'll hang on.

338
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
- There's a surprise.
- What the f...? Curly.

339
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,800
- Go ahead, check your freezer.
- All right, I'll check the freezer.

340
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,000
Curly, don't hang up this phone.

341
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,100
You hear me?

342
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,800
Oh, my God!

343
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,200
He finally figures it out,
ladies and gentlemen.

344
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,900
It's really true what they say
about sluggers.

345
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,300
They are really, really stupid.

346
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,600
Well, I'm a pitcher, Bobby.
Pitchers use their brains.

347
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,600
Come on, Bradley.

348
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,300
We'll play a joke on him,
so you just play along.

349
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,200
- All right.
- Okay?

350
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
Hey, Coop.

351
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
Gil.

352
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,100
Gil.

353
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,800
- Gil Renard.
- Yeah.

354
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,800
Gil Renard.

355
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Yeah, long time no see, Gil.

356
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
- This is my son.
- Hi.

357
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,000
Come on in, fellas.

358
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,800
Go ahead.

359
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,100
Man, that is a kick-ass car.
You done good for yourself.

360
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,500
You never see nothing like that
in the Bronx.

361
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,200
I always thought
you'd be managing by now.

362
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,400
- Managing?
- Yeah, in the majors.

363
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,900
Nobody calls me Coop anymore,
you sick son of a bitch.

364
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,800
How'd you find me anyway?

365
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,500
I looked you up.

366
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,000
Whose kid is that, really?

367
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,200
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

368
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,100
- Bobby Rayburn's.
- Jesus fuck.

369
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,700
Same old fucking Gil. Come on.

370
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,700
Really?

371
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,800
He'll be on in a minute.

372
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,900
You'll recognize his voice.

373
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:15,100
All right, incoming call. Notify
incoming call. Turn off all radios.

374
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,900
Okay, this is it.

375
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,400
Bob.

376
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,200
- Yeah.
- Hey, Bobby, you still up?

377
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,700
- Bad time to be calling, huh?
- I'm up.

378
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,500
Hey, I hope I'm not calling at a bad time.
Probably got some people over, huh?

379
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I can't hear you. You'll have to
turn the music down.

380
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,800
Oh, I'm sorry, slugger.

381
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Curly, I want to talk to Sean.

382
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Sean, he's asleep now, but he's doing
fine. Don't worry about him. He's fine.

383
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,500
- Curly, what do you want?
- "I've been thinking it over."

384
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,600
You know, in life, life just...

385
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,100
...comes down to one single action.

386
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,300
What do you want?

387
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,300
I want you to hit a home run
for me, Bob.

388
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,300
Are you serious?

389
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,700
{y:i}Remember that kid in chemo...

390
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,600
...whose life was unfair to him?

391
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,700
That's how I'm feeling.
My life has been unfair to me.

392
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,700
{y:i}The only difference is, I'll be able to see
{y:i}you hit that home run tomorrow.

393
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,300
{y:i}And I got a photo here.

394
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,700
I'm gonna get it to you. And I want you
to put it on the Jumbotron, okay?

395
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,800
- Yeah.
- Then I want you to stand up and tell...

396
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,600
...the 50 million viewers...

397
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,200
...that this home run
is dedicated to Gil, a true fan.

398
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,100
- What do you think?
- I can't believe you're serious.

399
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm serious as a heart attack, Bobby.

400
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
That's pretty serious, isn't it?

401
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,200
There comes a time in everybody's life
when you have to stand for something.

402
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,500
Otherwise, you're just
passing on through.

403
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,900
So, Bobby, I'm watching you.

404
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,500
If that pitcher goes easy on you,
I'll kill your fucking kid.

405
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,600
Surprise, surprise.

406
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,100
Hey, Bobby.

407
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,100
I'm still here.

408
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,700
Now do you care?

409
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,900
You get in some serious shit for that.

410
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,800
Cops are gonna be all over us.

411
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,600
Boy, all of a sudden,
you lost your sense of humour.

412
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,600
- Did you get it?
- Couldn't get him.

413
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,300
He's calling from Rayburn's car. We
should be able to nail him to the district.

414
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,500
You're not gonna believe this kid.
Just like old times, huh, Coop?

415
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,200
- You know, that's not my real dad.
- It's okay, kid.

416
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,800
Come on, I'm waiting.

417
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
I'm waiting. The signals.

418
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,900
What happened? Did you forget
everything? Come on, Coop.

419
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,700
Hang in there, kid.

420
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,100
Bring the bat up, slugger.

421
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,700
Come on, look like a hitter.
Bring it up.

422
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Bring it up. Come on.

423
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,500
Come on! Come on, slugger,
bring the fucking bat up.

424
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,700
Come on.

425
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,500
That's my boy.

426
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,600
It's all right, kid, hang in there, now.
Hang in there.

427
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,900
Coop, you dickhead!

428
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,900
Come on, kid. Come on.

429
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,400
Go. Go. Up the fence. Come on.

430
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,200
Come on, push. Push. Go.

431
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,100
Go. Go on. Go, kid, go.

432
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,500
Coop, what are you doing?

433
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,500
Why did you do that?
We could've been teammates.

434
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,300
We were teammates.
We could've made it to the bigs.

435
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,800
It was Little League.
We were 12 years old.

436
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,700
Come on.

437
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
That's my boy.

438
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,500
{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,
{y:i}leading off the second inning...

439
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,100
{y:i}... Giants centre fielder, number 33,
{y:i}Bobby Rayburn.

440
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,000
{y:i}Well, the forecast is for rain tonight.

441
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,200
There's a mist falling as Rayburn steps
towards the box.

442
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
He's been more aggressive
the last month of the season.

443
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,300
Who do we have on line two?

444
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,000
- Just a fan.
- Hey, Mr. Fan, how you doing?

445
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
Wanna say you're lucky to be
in the stadium tonight.

446
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,900
Really? Why's that?

447
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,600
- Is that a Giants watch I hear playing?
- Yes, it is.

448
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,800
- Is that my buddy Gil?
- Maybe.

449
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,600
This'll be one of the most amazing
nights in the game's history.

450
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,700
- "It'll be incredible."
- Really? Why's that, Gil?

451
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,300
I'm telling you,
the Kirk Gibson homer...

452
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,900
...Ripken breaking Gehrig's record,
peanuts compared to tonight.

453
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,200
{y:i}You're talking about classic moments
{y:i}in baseball history.

454
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,900
What's happening tonight
that could top those?

455
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,900
Let's just say Bobby Rayburn's...

456
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,300
- "... in for the night of his life."
- Why, Gil?

457
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,400
Well, some people are ungrateful.
They should be taught a lesson.

458
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,800
Strike!

459
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,000
Are you calling from
inside the stadium?

460
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,600
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- "Well..."

461
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,300
You got good seats? Are you behind
first base? Can you see me?

462
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,600
Can I see you?

463
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,500
{y:i}Yeah, you're waving right at me.
{y:i}Have a nice night.

464
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,100
Gil, wait. Before you hang up,
I wanted to ask you a question.

465
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,700
- Trying to trace the call, Jewel?
- What? What was that, Gil?

466
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,200
You'll never find me.

467
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,000
- Strike!
- Have a nice night.

468
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,700
Gil. Fuck!

469
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Come on, man, go get him!

470
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,500
Play!

471
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,100
Yes!

472
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,500
Shit.

473
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,200
{y:i}Now batting, number 10, Brad Tjader.

474
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,800
- Did you feel that raindrop?
- What?

475
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,200
I felt rain.

476
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,000
- The guy's not gonna be crazy enough...
- He's here! The guy's here.

477
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,500
- He could've been near a radio.
- He's in the stadium.

478
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,200
Look at that. That is one fine piece
of craftsmanship.

479
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,100
- What?
- The knife.

480
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,000
It's a first edition. See how it
says "prototype?

481
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,300
That means it's a collector's piece.

482
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,800
"Renard & Garrity." It's a local firm,
isn't it? Gilbert Renard?

483
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,800
What are you waiting for,
a clue, an invite?

484
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,200
This guy is gonna kill Bobby's kid
if you don't find him in nine innings.

485
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,300
{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen, leading off
{y:i}the bottom of the eighth...

486
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,000
{y:i}... number 33, Bobby Rayburn.

487
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,400
Bobby's as safe as Kennedy was
in Dallas. What are you looking for?

488
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,600
Play!

489
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,800
Ball one.

490
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,800
- What, are you walking me?
- Consider it a compliment, dickhead.

491
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,200
Fuck! Do you know what you're
doing to me?!

492
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,200
- They're giving him first base.
- Throw the pitch!

493
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,300
Fuck!

494
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,300
{y:i}Fuck.

495
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,400
Oh, man, the ump's gonna
call the game. Oh, my... Fuck.

496
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,400
Oh, God, please don't do this.
I'm begging you.

497
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,300
Don't... Throw the pitch.

498
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,900
For God's sake, listen to me!
Throw the pitch!

499
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,400
Throw the fucking pitch!

500
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,900
- Do you know what you're doing to me?
- "The umpire has decided..."

501
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,400
{y:i}... to send both teams
{y:i}into the dugouts.

502
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,900
It looks like we've got a rain delay.

503
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,500
{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen, the umpire
{y:i}has called for a rain delay...

504
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,200
{y:i}... with the Padres
{y:i}leading the Giants 2 to 1.

505
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,600
Do you and your dad have a special
place he and you like to go?

506
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,900
Stadium in the Sky's
our Little League park.

507
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,300
{y:i}My dad used to play there
{y:i}when he was a kid.

508
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,000
Is my daddy in trouble?

509
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,300
{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen...

510
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,200
{y:i}... we resume play with the Giants
{y:i}batting in the bottom of the eighth.

511
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,900
{y:i}Proceed to Little League park
{y:i}Stadium in the Sky, 24th and Sanchez.

512
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,400
We pick it up in the eighth inning...

513
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,800
...on what might be Rayburn's
last at-bat.

514
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,800
They'll play on this wet field.

515
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,500
The cold night air is getting
to everybody. Look at Rayburn.

516
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,900
He's going to the mound to have
a chat with Martinez.

517
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,800
- Oh, shit.
- I don't give a fuck what he tells you.

518
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,300
Throw the ball over the plate,
or I'll break your head in.

519
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,400
- Fuck you.
- You hear me?

520
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,800
{y:i}This may go back to when Martinez
{y:i}pitched for Pittsburgh.

521
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,300
{y:i}He drilled Rayburn in his back
{y:i}with a fastball.

522
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
{y:i}We are seeing it all tonight, Rick.

523
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,800
- Let's go, gentlemen.
- First pitch is at your head, buddy.

524
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,900
Come on, man, do this! Do this!

525
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,900
{y:i}A critical at-bat for Rayburn,
{y:i}the $40 million San Francisco Giant.

526
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,800
{y:i}Probably his last chance
{y:i}to get the Giants even.

527
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,000
{y:i}Here in the bottom of the eighth,
{y:i}the Giants trail 2 to 1.

528
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,400
- "Swung on. Strik e one."
- Strike!

529
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,800
All right, come on! Come on, Bobby!

530
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,600
{y:i}Swung on and missed. Strik e two.
{y:i}Rayburn in the hole.

531
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,000
{y:i}One strik e left
{y:i}for Bobby Rayburn tonight.

532
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,700
Jesus Christ, man.

533
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,000
{y:i}Air Seven copy. Proceeding
{y:i}to Stadium in the Sky. Over.

534
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,500
- Man.
- They're gonna call the game.

535
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,100
They're gonna call this fucking game.

536
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
{y:i}Two and two. Two balls, two strik es.

537
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,600
{y:i}And Rayburn down to his last strik e.

538
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,100
{y:i}Bobby knows he's had
{y:i}two pitches to drive there.

539
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,500
Now at 2-2, you're not gonna
get another good pitch to hit.

540
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,200
{y:i}Maybe, since it's damp, he's having
{y:i}trouble holding the ball.

541
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,700
This game could be called
at any second.

542
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,900
Play ball!

543
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,600
{y:i}San Diego protecting
{y:i}its one-run lead.

544
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,600
{y:i}Martinez readies, steadies
{y:i}and delivers to...

545
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,200
{y:i}Rayburn drives it deep
{y:i}to right centre field!

546
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,500
- Yes!
- Yes! Go!

547
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,100
- Run!
- Home run!

548
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,900
It's off the wall. Rayburn could get
three if he hustles.

549
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,400
{y:i}Robinson having trouble
{y:i}just getting to the ball.

550
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,600
{y:i}Rayburn, rounding second,
{y:i}headed for third.

551
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,800
{y:i}He ran through the stop sign. It could
{y:i}be an inside-the-park home run!

552
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,200
{y:i}The relay from Park er!
{y:i}Rayburn slides, headfirst!

553
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,000
{y:i}And he is...

554
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,500
{y:i}... in there!

555
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,400
Yes!

556
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,000
You're out!

557
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,700
What is that?

558
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,500
Bad fucking call, man!

559
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,600
- You're out! Sit down!
- No, no, no.

560
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,800
I beat it by a fucking mile!

561
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,700
You're out. You're questioning my call?
Sit down! You're out! Sit down!

562
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,600
You're the fucking guy!
He's the fucking guy!

563
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,200
It's the umpire!

564
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,600
What the fuck is that?

565
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,500
This way! Break it open!

566
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,400
- Shit.
- What the hell's going on?

567
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,700
Okay, okay. I just want my kid back.

568
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,200
Batter up, Bobby.
I waited a long time for this.

569
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,500
No, no, no, wait. No. Okay, look.

570
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,700
- Where's Sean?
- Where do you think he is?

571
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,300
Come on, where is my son?

572
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,900
Where's...? Bobby,
where's my home run?

573
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,000
What?! Curly. Curly.
Where's my son?!

574
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,900
Where is he? I don't know.

575
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,400
I guess he's in that big stadium
in the sky.

576
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,900
I'm telling you, Curly,
if you hurt my fucking kid...

577
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,200
...I swear to God I'll kill you!
- Bobby. Bobby. Be nice, Bob.

578
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,400
What do you want from me?

579
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,100
I don't want anything.
I just want you to...

580
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,800
- I never showed you my best pitch.
- Curly!

581
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Curly!

582
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,400
Freeze!

583
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,200
No, no, don't shoot! He's got my son.

584
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,600
Now do you care?

585
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,900
Bobby, now do you care?

586
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
Just a little bit?

587
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,500
Curly, don't!

588
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,000
Curly, where's my son?

589
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,800
Where's Sean, Curly?
Where's my son?

590
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,900
A simple "thank you"
would have been nice.

591
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,800
Where's my son?

592
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,200
Curly, where's my son?!

593
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,900
There she is,
site of the old stadium.

594
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,600
Sean!

595
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,300
Sean!

596
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,600
Sean!

597
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,800
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

598
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,400
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Dad.

599
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,900
I got him!

600
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,800
{y:i}What you are seeing here
{y:i}is a sad turn of events indeed.

601
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,300
{y:i}Gil Renard, an unemployed
{y:i}knife salesman...

602
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,600
{y:i}... was shot to death by the police
{y:i}during tonight's game.

603
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,900
{y:i}Here's how it happened.
{y:i}Bobby Rayburn...
