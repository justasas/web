00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,238
Paolo?

2
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,673
Paolo?

3
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,892
Paolo, are you here?

4
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,795
Oh Paolo, of course I love you.

5
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,513
CONFESSIONS TO MARIKLA

6
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,892
HOW MUCH DOES LOVE
INVOLVE YOU?

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,695
'Dear Marikla,

8
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,573
'I'm writing to you
because I need your advice.

9
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,910
'I'm 24 and have been married
for five years.

10
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,789
'I've been told that I'm pretty
and that I'm nice to be around.

11
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,416
'I have a good job
and a wonderful husband.

12
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,212
'I know I married a bit young,
but it's worked out really well.

13
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,506
'Lots of passion to start out with,

14
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,425
'and lots of understanding
to keep it together.

15
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,816
'Except that for a while now
I've been feeling upset

16
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,068
'in a kind of strange way.

17
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,820
'It's hard to explain.

18
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:39,867
'I want to live more... more fully,
more intensely.

19
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:44,163
'But my days are so uneventful,
they're almost hum-drum.

20
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,165
'I tell myself that
it must be the season

21
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:51,170
'that's making me have
these strange restless cravings.

22
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,131
'But the fact is that they've become
stronger and stronger lateIy.

23
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,635
'Especially since that night
my sister Nadia took us to a party

24
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,430
'in honour of a Venetian poetess. '

25
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,647
I'd like to fuck you
and not touch you,

26
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,567
and, loose tongued,
make a chant resound

27
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,278
among the uncertain hairs
of your ass.

28
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,907
I'd like to stuff dancing cunts
in your mouth.

29
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,703
I'd like to cover you with sticky breasts
and perfumed sweat!

30
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,666
And down between your balls,
suck your cock into my heartache.

31
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:36,465
I'd like, between lusty cornholings
and a sob, to lick your knees.

32
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:41,094
And upwards,
from your belly to your heart.

33
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,514
And to find some rest,
I'd Iike not...

34
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,558
to be abIe to come anymore.

35
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,479
How exceptional!
Neo-positivist influences...

36
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,359
Brava!

37
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,169
Congratulations.
Your book will be a smash.

00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,588

I run a body-fitness gym.

49

Everyone gate-crashes in Rome,
no one needs an invitation.

50
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,978
I wasn't invited either.

51
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,816
I accompanied the poetess.

In Venice
we are next-door neighbours.

53
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,946
Nowhere's like Venice, is it?
I was born there.

54
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:27,409
Ah, oui? Do you know how it was
described by a famous French poet?

55
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,912
"Venice - sexe femelle d'Europe. "

56
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,381
Are you a sailor, with those tattoos?

57
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:46,094
Oh, I travel around, you know?

58
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,013
I pick up old things.

59
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,350
I wish you'd go there and pick up those
two old biddies and throw them out!

60
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,811
-  You like the boy?
- Well, he is my husband, after all.

61
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,148
Come on, husbands don't count!

62
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,985
Maybe not for you,
but mine counts a lot for me.

63
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,618
I'd like to fuck you
and not touch you...

64
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:17,250
... and, loose-tongued,
make a chant resound...

65
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,963
... among the uncertain hairs
of your ass.

66
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,050
I'll bet you're sopping wet.

67
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,472
Excuse me. My head is spinning.

68
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,739
Don't bother with museums, you fools,
art is among us, we are art.

69
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,866
I give you two perfect examples
of the baroque.

70
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,119
Their prominent masses flatten out
as they come down.

71
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,495
Borromini brought to life!

72
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,539
Turn them around
and you have two prominent asses

73
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,499
in pure rococo style, gorgeous!

74
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,174
- But...
- Shh. Do not be afraid.

75
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,927
I'm not afraid.
But I don't know what your name is.

76
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,097
Oh, très juste.
Alphonse Donatien.

77
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,183
Pirate d'amour.

78
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,548
I was so right about you.
You're at high tide.

79
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,098
Man, that's not fair!

80
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,851
I'm doing everything I promised to do.

81
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,880
Diana, are you in there?

82
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,925
Yes, Paolo. Just a minute.

83
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,691
I hadn't seen you for a while.
Anything wrong?

84
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,986
Of course not, I just had to pee.
Do you want to leave, darling?

85
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,239
Yeah, I'm bored silly.
This party's the shits.

86
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,659
Whatever you like.
I'll get my things.

87
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,380
Paolo!

88
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,215
You're dripping.

89
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,720
And it's not pee.
What gives, you hot so soon?

90
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,515
Well, if you touch me there,
of course I get wet.

91
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,684
You know how sensitive I am.

92
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,352
Do it some more.

93
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,193
Was it that guy or me
who brought it out in you?

94
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:34,281
- What guy?
- Your partner. The dancer.

95
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,451
Oh. He's French.
He has a home in Venice, he said.

96
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,787
He came on
Iike some kind of cyclone.

97
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,041
Paolo, you're driving me crazy.

98
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,710
A little mature, wasn't he?

99
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:51,047
- Mature isn't the word.
- You should've called me, my dear.

100
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,091
You just seem to assume
that I fought it.

101
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,303
- I even found him in the bathroom there.
- That filth?

102
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,557
You just didn't realise it,
right there, standing behind the door.

103
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,935
Ah, you're kidding.
It's just another one of your silly stories.

104
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,022
- He had me naked in no time.
- Quit that!

105
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,859
He wanted to give it to me in the ass,
if you hadn't shown up right then.

106
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,945
You're inventing everything.
I know it! I'm no idiot!

107
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,947
He thought my ass was beautiful.

108
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,660
How was... how was his thing?

109
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,204
Did he make you feel it?
Was it as hard as this?

110
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,011
You like my ass, don't you, Paolo?

111
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,889
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's the most gorge...

112
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,855
You can't give an opinion
unless you look at it first.

113
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,862
- Tell me I have a beautiful ass.
- It's beautiful.

114
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,616
Oh, God!

115
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,455
- Let's go home, come on.
- No!

116
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,583
- Let's do it here!
- Huh?

117
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,671
Hurry up!

118
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,964
Huh, amateurs!

119
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,513
Tell me you made it all up.
Oh, tell me!

120
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,265
Be quiet!

121
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,568
- And they call us whores!
- You got it.

122
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,334
Bonjour!

123
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,760
OK now, lazy-bone, rise and shine!

124
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,680
I'll teach you some good manners!

125
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,475
No, you're hurting me! Stop it!

126
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,687
Hey, what gives?

127
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,358
Lay off, will you?

128
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,652
You're being raped, Mister.
How do you like it?

129
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,784
Put it on hold! Carnal violence
is put off until this evening!

130
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,119
No!

131
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,497
Hey, let go!
Let go of the merchandise!

132
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,007
If my mother could see the chaos
you make me live in!

133
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,925
I think it's nice.

134
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,803
And besides,
wicked witches don't have to like it.

135
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,140
I beg your pardon! You're not to speak
about my mother like that.

136
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,476
OK, Mr Grumbly, OK.

137
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,327
It's just the Water Music of Mozart!

138
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,288
Come sing.

139
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,500
You can Handel that!

140
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,773
That's complete amorality!

141
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,233
You pig!

142
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,997
That son of a bitch
dribbled right up the middle!

143
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,291
You kidding?
That shithead's nowhere.

144
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,795
He couldn't find the hole in that hoop
if they stuffed his face inside it!

145
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,380
Got great hands.

146
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,882
You know
what Hal Taylor would do?

147
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,843
That so-called turkey
is a great clutch player!

148
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,512
Is that what you call a centre?

149
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,473
He's the greatest centre
in the league right now.

150
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,559
I'm out of patience
with assholes like you

151
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,435
who wouldn't know a point guard
from a pivot!

152
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,690
- You need a crooked umpire to win!
- You ever seen a basketball game?

153
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,568
Let go of me, goddammit?

154
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,153
Let go of what?
Jesus Christ, a fag!

155
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,239
I've been standing here
talking to a fag all this time!

156
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,740
You grabbed my cock!

157
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,826
Now I know why you
like that Taylor kid so much.

158
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,578
You're lucky this is my stop!

159
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,163
Or what,
you would've kissed me?

160
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,396
Miss, take my seat. Please do!

161
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,316
Thanks, no,
my stop is coming up.

162
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,673
Sorry. I'm sorry.

163
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,551
Hey, listen. You gotta get
a couple of things clear.

164
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,680
Get the mud out of your upstairs.
I can see it's hard on you.

165
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,099
That little thing might just
ruin your vocation.

166
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,561
- Miss...
- Take my advice, kid. Go confess all.

167
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,730
How... about a phone call?

168
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,482
- Do you have my number?
- No.

169
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,026
You're outta luck, boy.

170
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,283
So long!

171
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,172
Hi, Lello.

172
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,925
You're crying, what's the matter?

173
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,512
He's left me.
He's gone back to his wife.

174
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,932
The battle-axe has the vapours,
and he feels guilty, says it's our fault.

175
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,185
- Is that true?
- I should know? Perhaps it is.

176
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,562
Only with a million guys to pick on,
why pick on my guy?

177
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,565
Now, Lello, just get your best drag
on tonight and go cruising,

178
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,859
you'll find one
ten thousand times better!

179
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,028
- You really think so?
- Guaranteed.

180
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,452
Hey, your diet, Antonietta!

181
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,790
Like the lady said, everything I like
is either illegal, immoral, or fattening!

182
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,375
Really!

183
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,296
Look, I have a terrific surprise
for you!

184
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,675
It gave me some ideas
for a really memorable night with Pierre.

185
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,886
- Is there a new way, huh?
- The Atom Bomb, just try it!

186
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,853
You're just dying
to take it home with you, Lello!

187
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,814
I bought six like it yesterday,
only a much better quality.

188
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,067
Then you should invite us all up
to have a look at them, least you can do.

189
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,539
Hello, kids, hard at work?
That's fine.

190
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,874
Hi, Mr Silvio.

191
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,752
Oh, Antonietta,
some new items have come in.

192
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,796
Would you mind very much
modelling a few in the South Wing?

193
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,090
Oh, that's really very nice of you.

194
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,469
- I'll be right there.
-  Come along, my dear.

195
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,847
Oh!

196
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,516
Some girls have
all the luck, huh!

197
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,856
Er... the rest of you can take a break.

198
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,944
Come here.

199
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,238
Lean back.

200
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,119
Ah, yes.

201
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,499
Let me see the one on the right today.

202
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,375
Let me see all of you.

203
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,337
Spread your legs.

204
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,053
Now bend this leg a little.

205
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,848
And turn around now.

206
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,934
That's it.

207
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,478
Pull your panties up
tight between the cheeks.

208
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,528
Oh... just my size!

209
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:39,575
This morning I woke up
with a third leg like a telephone pole,

210
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,410
and I thought of you right away!

211
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,287
I'm really flattered.

212
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,607
- Good morning, all. Hello, Diana.
- Hello, Mrs Tommasini.

213
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,818
You seem to be dressed
in mourning, though.

214
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,529
I am, unfortunately.
I lost my little Danny.

215
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,407
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Somebody very close?

216
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,367
Oh, yes, intimate.

217
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,661
We'd been together for ages.
He was a wonderful labrador.

218
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,038
Ah... I imagine.

219
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,707
And how's your husband,
the Senator?

220
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,418
In France eating foiegras
and fighting hunger in the world.

221
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,712
Have you prepared those articles
as I asked you?

222
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,338
Of course.

223
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,465
I can't wait to fill up my drawers.

224
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,930
Let's try these.

225
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,308
But they're the same ones
you chose last Thursday.

226
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,186
I'm no idiot,
I stick with what works well.

227
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,479
They wound up ripped into shreds.

228
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,398
That engineer has tastes of his own.

229
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,359
An engineer?
Your newest conquest, huh?

230
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,154
No, but one of the most generous.
Cartier!

231
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,323
Gosh. Congratulations.

232
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,701
Oh well, at least I'm never bored
in the afternoons.

233
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,703
I've found a little group of friends.

234
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,581
I was introduced by Alicia.
She's a client of yours.

235
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,541
Alicia? Oh, I know, Mrs Dow.

236
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,543
Right, the one they call Mrs Sow.

237
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,880
Doctors, lawyers, undersecretaries.
You make great money.

238
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,007
If you're interested,
I'll talk to her about you.

239
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:22,511
Oh, gee, thanks a lot, but I...
I just don't think I could really, I mean...

240
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,263
Trafficking poontang?

241
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,307
Come on, honey,
this isn't what you think it is.

242
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,478
I'm not really a pro. Fills in spare time!
And plenty of ladies do it.

243
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,815
Anyway, real whores never come.
I do, like an avalanche!

244
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,484
Oh, men have great imagination.

245
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,237
I learn something nice and quirky
on almost every date!

246
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,155
You mean that wouldn't interest you?

247
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,741
My husband has imagination enough.

248
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,870
Oh, mine doesn't! How inventive can
an envoy to the European Parliament be?

249
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,039
Oh, but it's so romantic
to meet someone unknown,

250
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,208
in some hotel room, in an apartment.

251
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,751
Your heart goes like mad.

252
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,796
It's an adventure of the unknown,
it's marvellous!

253
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,215
And then the thrill
of feeling yourself up for sale!

254
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,094
Oh, the shame, the sin...
I'd give it a whirl, if I were you.

255
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,805
I must say I really think
I ought to pass on...

256
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,932
I know a Chilean bishop
who'd simply adore you.

257
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,727
- Priests have never been my ideal.
- They're the best customers, believe me!

258
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,480
- All right, I'll take a gross.
- OK, great!

259
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,404
Mrs Tommasini is really very nice.

260
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,114
She's a big success in what she does,

261
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,659
which is actually something like what I do,
if you want to know the truth.

262
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,494
In there getting porked, yes.

263
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,455
My precious favours
in return for a raise in pay.

264
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,916
My husband isn't sorry,
and neither am I.

265
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,209
Do you mean that?

266
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,211
Well, he doesn't know
all the details, of course.

267
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,629
No guilt about it, for Pierre?

268
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,340
Please, I'm not in love
with this old geezer.

269
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,968
But you're still betraying
your husband, aren't you?

270
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,012
I don't see
how you got that in your mind.

271
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,680
Come on, don't play so dumb!

272
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,473
It's not easy to define.

273
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,601
With Pierre it's special -
there's tenderness, and more.

274
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,229
With the others,
a poke is a picnic!

275
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,023
See you soon, Diana.

276
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,483
Should you change your mind,
call me on the telephone.

277
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,153
OK, I'll keep it in mind, thanks.

278
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,495
I don't know how you can bring yourself
to do those things with the boss.

279
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,289
Just for openers, he's ugly as sin.

280
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,584
I'm not gonna cry over that.
There's my handsome Mister Pierre.

281
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,544
And there's something special
with the uglies.

282
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,504
They're so much more generous
than the pretties.

283
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,758
Fact is, they need to have us girls
pardon their homeliness, all the time.

284
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,802
- I guess.
- Some people call it wicked.

285
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,512
It's big fun, though.

286
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,557
When I make it with the boss,
I feel like I'm screwing my own dad.

287
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,351
So... big deal!

288
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,604
A little incest.
Happy banging I say!

289
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,899
- What if you get knocked up?
- Oh, come on, there's no danger.

290
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,235
It's simple,
use the most natural of methods.

291
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,487
Just take it here!

292
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,034
Diana! My God.
Are you all right?

293
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,246
I'm all right. It's OK.

294
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,542
Diana? Would you mind
coming to the workroom?

295
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:02,713
- There's someone here to see you.
- Oh, yes, yes. Thank you.

296
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,882
I'll be right there.

297
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,479
Nadia, what are you doing here?

298
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,398
Delicately, Nadia!

299
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,150
- Aunt Emma just kicked the bucket.
- Blessed Mary, she didn't?

300
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,778
It's a good thing
I told her to use a little tact.

301
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,240
I can't leave the gym right now.
You'll have to go to the funeral.

302
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,534
And you were always her pet,
and we all know it.

303
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,620
But I don't know.
I'm afraid I...

304
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,373
- My job, Paolo...
- No problem, Diana.

305
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,833
None whatever.

306
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,420
You go to Venice tomorrow for that
funeral, and don't worry about us.

307
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,797
And don't worry about Paolo.

308
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,549
You're going to be away.

309
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,135
And while you are,
I'll take care of him.

310
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,053
I promise you.

311
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,602
I'm sorry, darling,
I wish I could go with you,

312
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,272
but this is a bad time,
I'm up to my neck in work.

313
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,900
Don't worry. I'm a big girl.
I can handle it on my own.

314
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,362
I'm worried about your fidelity.
You know how sexy funerals are.

315
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:12,908
- Paolo, that's crazy!
- It's an established historical fact.

316
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,869
A funeral atmosphere creates,
on its own,

317
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,788
a contrasting,
compensating desire to screw.

318
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,749
It says so in an article on adultery
I've been reading.

319
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,418
Do you know that statistics show

320
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,588
that over 60% of Italian wives
cheat on their husbands?

321
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,677
- Hey, what the hell's this?
- Antonietta gave it to me.

322
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,971
What kind of a crowd
do you run around with?

323
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,639
People who aren't ashamed
of what they do.

324
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,851
Not up-tight old frumps like you.
Let's take a look at it.

325
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,394
If you insist.

326
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,918
'Come in, please.
Is the gentleman with you?'

327
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,294
'He's my husband.

328
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,963
- 'Wait here, will you, darling?'
- 'Of course, dear. '

329
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,760
Oh, that's nice, oh yes.

330
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,514
- Mm... like that.
-  'Get undressed, please. '

331
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,559
Further down, to the right.

332
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,904
'Panties too, please. '

333
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,248
You're off target, Jack.

334
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,377
'Sit down here.

335
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,924
'Open wide. '

336
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,052
Well, what do you think?

337
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,931
When you go to the gynaecologist,
I mean does he, er... ?

338
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,435
That man?
But he's at least 90!

339
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,688
Supposing he was
a young and handsome guy?

340
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,065
Well, it depends. I couldn't say.

341
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,651
- 'Doctor, what are you doing?'
- 'Just doing my job, ma'am.

342
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,653
'Now relax and let me concentrate. '

343
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,406
Would it upset you a lot if I did?

344
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,116
I'd be furious as hell, dammit!

345
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,829
And you'd have
no other type of reaction?

346
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,332
I... I'd be excited!

347
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,627
You know, that even goes on
at the store, all the time.

348
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,796
It's our boss, what a horny man!

349
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,840
He paws me
every single minute, honest!

350
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,175
Oh yeah? Where does he paw you?

351
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,304
All over - my tits, my ass...

352
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,640
He was even grabbing a feel
while he was saying his condolences.

353
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,019
What a swine!
How about you, how did you react?

354
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,771
You just stood there, I bet!
Come on, tell me.

355
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,440
I got carried away.

356
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,984
I wound up being dragged
into the back room.

357
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,653
Yeah? Then what did he do to you?
Tell me!

358
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,697
He threw me down on the table.

359
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,533
He opened my legs,
and he touched me right on the button.

360
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,327
- You mean here, don't you?
- Yeah.

361
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,704
- Like that?
- Yes, like that.

362
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,997
Then what?

363
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:09,084
Then he turned me around
and made me bend forward.

364
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,757
'Oh, fuck! What a cock!

365
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,259
'Give it to me! All of it!

366
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,474
- 'Rip my ass apart!'
- Higher up, darling, higher up!

367
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,351
Please!

368
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,479
I can't take it!
It's your fault, you little sow!

369
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,898
That imagination of yours
excites me too much!

370
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,227
You could both do a lady a favour today.

371
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,730
Sure, it'd be a pleasure.

372
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,483
I'm very willing to pay.
Shall we say a million lire?

373
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,444
But to do what, though?

374
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,612
I want you to help me.

375
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,197
It's so cruel.

376
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,575
My ass is still a virgin.
Would you... ?

377
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,702
Money to do it? Nah...

378
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,788
I know it's incurably romantic,
but this guy says "no go".

379
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,114
I'm in mourning.
Would you please not act so uncouth?

380
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,712
Subject to an absolutely binding
clause by whose terms he will be enjoined

381
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,257
from putting up new buildings
or additional floors to the existing ones,

382
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,301
I bequeath to Marco Valentini,

383
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,971
son of my brother Luigi Valentini
and therefore my legitimate nephew,

384
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,807
the property of Villa di Mira...

385
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,225
She was always so selfish!

386
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,769
... of which he has clear
and free title legally.

387
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,021
Is she kidding, that old ruin?

388
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,607
It'll only take 60 times what it's worth
to fix it up!

389
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,025
Item!

390
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,528
I bequeath to Diana Bruni,

391
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,698
daughter of the late Giovanna Valentini
and therefore my legitimate niece

392
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,827
my property consisting
of the top floor of the building...

393
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,497
- Oh!
- ... at 1477 Giudecca, Old Town.

394
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,500
In its present condition
and with everything inside it

395
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,127
such as is to be found
at the moment of my decease.

396
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,089
You have all the luck.
It's just what I wanted to get my claws on.

397
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,091
It was going to be
my pied-a-terre in Venice!

398
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,342
Clause three.

399
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,386
I do hereby take
all my other properties

400
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,264
and all my gifts and incomes
accruing thereto,

401
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,934
as well as my cash account and bonds in
branch number six of the Bank of Venice

402
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,521
and leave them to the convent of
the Carmelite Nuns in Vittorio Veneto,

403
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,440
- whom I supported fervently all my life.
- God bless her.

404
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,317
Your signatures.

405
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,951
You look great.

406
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,329
- The air in Rome!
- Thanks.

407
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,790
I'm going to take a look at the penthouse.
Do you want to see it?

408
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,960
That's impossible, Marco.
We have guests tonight.

409
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,713
Don't worry about a thing, Nora.
You go on back to Padova.

410
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,175
I'll go along with Diana
and I'll be home in time for dinner.

411
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,013
Once again, please.

412
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,516
Father, you sign down
at the bottom of the page.

413
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,767
The last shall be the first.

414
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,563
- I'm glad you came along with me.
- Strange lady, Aunt Emma.

415
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,273
She liked us a lot, you and me.

416
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,484
Actually, of all the relatives, I'm the one
that spent the least time with her.

417
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,570
- But you knew about her?
- Well, sure.

418
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,739
At least the things the family said.

419
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,242
Discreet, organised, intelligent...
above all, skillful.

420
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,161
Skillful? In what sense?

421
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:58,290
Skillful in bed, two or three lovers
at a time, maybe four.

422
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,711
The right men though, stalwart citizens,
full of cash and possibilities.

423
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,297
They helped her
make her money grow.

424
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,799
As it turned out,
she learned her lessons very well.

425
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,928
For herself and for us,
as we heard in her will.

426
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,304
How about Uncle Harry?

427
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,766
A mystery! Did he know about
her infidelities or didn't he?

428
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,726
Did he like it, or was it killing him?

429
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,438
Well, I still think he was really
never interested in women.

430
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,691
But one thing's for sure,
Emma was always gaga over him.

431
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,778
And if he were alive today,
we wouldn't have inherited a thing.

432
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,115
What?

433
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,872
Don't worry, nobody's gonna take
your penthouse away from you, Diana.

434
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,291
It's yours, and you can do
whatever you want with it.

435
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,087
Who knows? I could run into you
in Venice from time to time.

436
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,507
Certainly you will.

437
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,510
- How's it going with you and Nora?
- How about with you and Paolo?

438
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,136
Stupendous!

439
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,305
- Does he know about us?
- Know what, Marco?

440
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,182
That I had you before him,

441
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,768
that in bed you and I did
everything you can do.

442
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,687
You think so?

443
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,773
My dear,
I have some bad news for you!

444
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,693
Come on, move it, Marco.

445
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,028
I feel Iike going up
to the tip of the Dogana.

446
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,698
- Do you remember?
- How could I forget?

447
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,392
You're a habit, you.
I need more and more.

448
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,853
I used call you the Erector Set.

449
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,355
You used to say
my Erector Set.

450
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,566
There's still the same
stink of pee here as always.

451
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,943
I bet with all the tourists,
even the ladies take a leak.

452
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,530
Spread your legs.
I can't make any headway like that.

453
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,907
You just don't have
the technique you once did.

454
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,744
No, you've just forgotten
how to do it standing up.

455
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,122
I was sure.

456
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,791
Yes, her comments
were quite uncalled-for.

457
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,169
She's learned nothing
after all these years.

458
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,260
Hey, what is this? You're not going
to leave me high and dry, are you?

459
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,722
Let's go to my house.
We can do it in style and comfort there.

460
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,432
You mean Aunt Emma's penthouse.

461
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,142
That house is mine!

462
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,353
Oh, I've decided I'm not going back.
I'll stay till tomorrow.

463
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,398
I want to spend
the first night in my house.

464
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,776
Yeah, but I've got to get back home.

465
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,736
We have these guests
coming for dinner.

466
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:36,406
Ah, as far as that goes,
I told Paolo that I'd return tonight.

467
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,794
No, Diana.
I simply can't do it. I can't.

468
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,797
No sweat, we'll make it
for some other time.

469
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,883
I'm going to make good use
of my house in Venice, yeah!

470
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,637
Marco, that's the ferry boat
for the station.

471
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,597
If you run you can make it!

472
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,433
Listen, Diana. Do you swear
you'll let me see the new house?

473
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,310
Sure!

474
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,229
I swear it.

475
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,940
But you got to hurry. Hurry!

476
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:15,445
So long!

477
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,677
My God!

478
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,056
Who would have expected this?

479
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,521
You were a trull, Aunt Em!

480
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,202
Well, it's sure to have cost you
a lot of blowjobs, this penthouse!

481
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,834
Darling Aunt Emma,
you're just sensational!

482
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,214
I love you more with every snapshot!

483
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,345
I did promise Paolo I'd call.
Wonder if the phone works?

484
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,993
Donatien, Alphonse.

485
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,757
'Allô, oui?'

486
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:54,594
Morning, could I please speak
with Alphonse Donatien?

487
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,054
'C'est moi. '

488
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,598
Ah, you might not recall,

489
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:02,227
Diana Bruni, you and I met
at someone's house in Rome

490
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,103
at the party to meet the poetess?

491
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,398
'Ah, oui, the lovely lady
I struck up a conversation with.

492
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,983
'Where are you calling from?'

493
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,862
Oh, Venice, I was left a small apartment
that I'd like redecorated.

494
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,614
'And that is why
you thought of me?'

495
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,492
Partly, after all, you said...

496
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,286
'I'm delighted that you did!
Let's talk about it, come on over. '

497
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,081
Come on over? Where?

498
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,042
'To my place, right now.
Palazzo Lorenzoni. It's easy to find.

499
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,169
'Just two steps
for the Embarcadero Ca' Rezzonico. '

500
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,380
I know Venice, I know where it is.

501
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,591
- 'Then hurry, please!'
- I'll be seeing you.

502
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,710
Oh, it's cold!

503
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,326
Welcome!

504
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,204
- Bright star.
- Hello.

505
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,874
Er... haven't we
already met somewhere?

506
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,544
Flesh lies languid.

507
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:18,089
The mouth has its own empiricist.

508
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:22,135
Turgid, behind, it rejoices
in the lacerated flesh.

509
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,098
This is more than strange.
It's preposterous.

510
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:32,437
Go on in.
Alphonse is waiting for you.

511
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,921
STREET OF THE FUCKABLES

512
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,132
Bonsoir!

513
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,178
You found the place
with very little effort, huh?

514
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,679
Sure.

515
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,517
You were with that poetess?

516
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,895
Oh, oui.

517
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,897
Just work.

518
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,483
At this hour of the night?

519
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,528
And you, didn't you come here for that?

520
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,952
Ever since that night,
it's been like this.

521
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,443
The house of marvels?

522
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:07,156
Wait till we go upstairs,
then you'll see.

523
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:11,285
- To paradise?
- Inferno. My inferno.

524
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,384
Uh-oh...

525
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,025
Anytime...

526
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,528
- Show me how to get there.
- No, you go first.

527
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,906
I want to admire your ass,
ton cul.

528
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:11,596
Is this all right?
Or do you want to see more?

529
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,602
Come on! Come get me!

530
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,219
My word!

531
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,972
It must have taken you quite some time
to collect all of these.

532
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,892
Oh, I started early, with that one!

533
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,730
It's my ex-wife.

534
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,650
It's a very expressive face, I find.

535
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,485
Ah, oui.

536
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:13,282
From her I learned that the physiognomy
of a person is all in the nates! lci!

537
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,619
This is a portrait gallery.

538
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:20,373
You can distinguish the timid ass,
the brave one, the stupid one,

539
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:25,002
the clever, the intelligent,
lazy, happy, sad, carefree.

540
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,506
Everyone is the ass that he has.

541
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,341
Oh.

542
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,972
So what am I?

543
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,516
Voyons...

544
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,984
Headstrong, willful and disobedient.

545
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:53,698
But still a little uptight,
closed, introverted.

546
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,742
Am I hopeless, Doc?

547
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,829
Not if you can play by the rules.

548
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,831
Let's hear the rules.

549
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:05,626
You must follow orders and do for me
everything I want.

550
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,087
If you cry out, I stop.

551
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,840
Everything, at your command?

552
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,425
Right.

553
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,052
- Down on all fours, over there.
- Why?

554
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:19,140
Oh, it's because the game has
already started, and you know it!

555
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,883
Feel him!

556
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:40,137
No... oh, how strong and proud!

557
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,099
- It's gonna hurt me, isn't it?
- Cry out and I'll stop!

558
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,601
It's up to you.

559
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,745
I'm so scared!

560
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,664
Do what I tell you...

561
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,916
and it will all be natural.

562
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,751
Breathe deep!

563
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,379
As if you were in child birth,
in labour.

564
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,881
Breathe with me!

565
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,937
Good.

566
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,941
Come on!

567
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,574
- Was that a scream, Diana?
- No. I broke through the canvas, though.

568
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,328
Oh, don't worry. C'estpas grave.
I'll have it restored.

569
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,840
L'enculeur... du monde!

570
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,808
'Happy banging I say!'

571
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,520
A FRIAR ONCE TOLD ME

572
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,939
ONE OF HIS BIGGEST PLEASURES
WAS TO MAKE A WOMAN BELIEVE

573
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,941
THAT HER ASS WAS NOT
MADE FOR SHITTING

574
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,152
NO, HER ASS WAS
SO DIVINE AND PRECIOUS

575
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,654
AND COULD MAKE MEN HAPPY
AND THUS AVOID ADULTERY

576
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,250
Incredible.

577
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,087
That fur piece was still
hanging up in the closet.

578
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,465
I found some snapshots, too.

579
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,927
Dear old Aunt Emma.
Who would ever have guessed?

580
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,638
The apartment is still
just the way you see it there.

581
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,890
Nothing's changed at all.

582
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,309
It's mind-boggling, you know?

583
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:54,021
You should see the view out the window,
the whole skyline of Venice.

584
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,358
For a young couple in love
that place is Paradise.

585
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,443
- Yeah, we put it up for rent.
- What?

586
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,904
I was going to keep it
for the two of us.

587
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,031
We're a young couple in love.

588
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,450
- Aren't we, darling?
- Uh-huh.

589
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,419
That's something new - you've shaved.

590
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,879
I've just indented the margins a little.

591
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,675
I have to be a demure and virtuous lady.
After all, I'm an heiress.

592
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,011
That'll be the day, oh yeah!

593
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,722
What an insult!

594
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,978
Auntie Emma got you excited, huh?

595
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,817
- I guess I shouId be jealous.
- I'm the one who ought to be jealous!

596
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,737
Tell me the truth, your cousin came over
to see the apartment, didn't he?

597
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,072
Of course he came over.

598
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,658
Marco wouldn't let
a chance like that go by.

599
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,368
Did he make a pass at you?

600
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:35,998
Well, he began to talk about when
the two of us used to go out together.

601
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,708
Tell me.

602
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,502
We'd go up to the tip of the Dogana,

603
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,672
and he'd touch my little flower
under my skirt,

604
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,259
- and I'd put my hand on him.
- Show me how you did it.

605
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,766
Careful there,
that meat's delicate!

606
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,769
He'd grab my head
and get it right down,

607
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,229
cos he wanted me
to take it in the mouth.

608
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,773
What did you do?

609
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,609
Well, I put up a struggle, of course,

610
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,611
but always a very brief one.

611
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,365
And did you do it again yesterday,
in your apartment on the Giudecca?

612
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,325
Mm-hmm.

613
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,351
Great fantasies you've got.

614
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,561
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,605
I know you and Marco
didn't do a thing, right?

616
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,148
One for you.

617
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,026
I decided to take advantage
of good old Alphonse instead.

618
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,779
Another gent? Who is he?

619
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,323
That French guy at the party
who I danced with.

620
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,827
I bet you inaugurated the apartment
like that, huh?

621
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,746
No, at his place.

622
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:00,165
Beautiful decor.

623
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,918
OK, give me the details.
Come on, come on.

624
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,963
He was crazy for my ass.

625
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,632
He had to have it, no matter what.

626
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,343
I couldn't have avoided it
even if I'd wanted to.

627
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,681
He spread my ass and started
licking my crack, down and up.

628
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,559
But it isn't so painful.

629
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,936
I could be persuaded.

630
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:27,568
- And did you... ?
- Did I? Like an express train!

631
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,157
What's the matter?
Why do you want me to stop?

632
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,242
- Who gave that hickey to you?
- Huh?

633
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,036
- That hickey on your neck!
- I don't know what you mean.

634
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,165
I thought you were making up
one of your stories, but you really did it!

635
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,625
No, please, let me explain.
Listen to me!

636
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,961
No, it isn't a fantasy this time.
He fucked you!

637
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,463
That bastard prick fucked you!

638
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,799
No, Paolo, I swear it.
He didn't fuck me at all!

639
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,176
I took it up the ass.

640
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:22,789
Please, darling, don't pout.

641
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,001
- Better to talk it over, huh?
- Get away from me!

642
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,546
We've always had a good laugh
over my little affairs.

643
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,008
You told me they made you horny.
You liked that just swell.

644
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,801
Because they weren't true!

645
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,387
There's no difference,
it doesn't matter in the least.

646
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,015
I'm really only yours.

647
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,893
Is it so naughty
if I make it with somebody else?

648
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,188
I mean it's all...
happy banging, right?

649
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:50,609
No, no, count me out! I don't want
any part of your happy banging!

650
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,362
I guess it seems like
the end of the world to you right now,

651
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,989
but you'll see, tomorrow...

652
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,701
Don't get near me.

653
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,912
We're history, the past.

654
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,039
There never will be
a tomorrow for us.

655
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:14,466
I'm not going to share my marriage bed
with someone like you, you slut!

656
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,683
I shouldn't be surprised after all.

657
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,228
Blood will tell,
but yours should be spilled!

658
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,822
Hey, you look all queer.

659
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,700
- Thanks to Paolo. Big fight.
- Beyond repair?

660
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,494
Well, he wants a separation.

661
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,872
No kidding! Another woman?

662
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,833
No, something other than that.
A man.

663
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,002
- Paolo?
- No, me!

664
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,545
It was a guy in Venice.

665
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,840
Oh, really!
You know, you had me scared.

666
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,218
Turns are up!
Let me get these broads outta here.

667
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,553
Head for the showers!

668
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,306
OK, I want to hear all the details.

669
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,936
- Woo!
- Don't do that.

670
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:56,193
Why in God's name did you tell him?
That's just asking for it.

671
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,403
Well, we were only joking around.

672
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,323
It was just what they call
a zipless fuck anyway.

673
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,371
Are you simply a slut or just dumb?

674
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,750
All men are really stupid pigs,
oily and nasty.

675
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,377
The rule is to deny.

676
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,879
Deny everything
in the face of the evidence.

677
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,715
Oh, they all preach equality of the sexes,
you can bet on it.

678
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,052
But no one practises it.
They're worms, all of them.

679
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,054
I don't want it to end up like this.

680
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,973
I was alone in bed last night
and couldn't sleep a wink.

681
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,226
The best thing is
to get a fresh male bod in there.

682
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,727
Who does Paolo think he is?

683
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,895
It's really simple.

684
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,857
No woman can be satisfied
through the 360-degree circle.

685
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,736
Not by one man -
each man has his own different taste.

686
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,530
And a girl needs to taste a lot.

687
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,365
You prattle and blather,

688
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,076
but the truth is, you got kicked out
by your husband, Nadia.

689
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,661
What's that? Please, kid,

690
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,747
there's a black and blue ass
in this story all right, but it's his.

691
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,792
No, no, no, come on,
that's farcical.

692
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:57,879
Listen, I'll walk humble,
only I must get him back, that's all.

693
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,340
- And you're gonna help me.
- Just how, my dear?

694
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:03,468
Have a chat with him.
Show him he's wrong.

695
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:07,013
- Make him listen to reason.
- Brilliant of you!

696
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,517
He has to realise that
the others just don't count.

697
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,853
And if he won't listen to me?

698
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,856
No, he trusts you.
He thinks a lot of you.

699
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,399
Please, Nadia.

700
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,862
Do I have carte blanche?

701
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,156
Just how do you...
how do you mean?

702
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,742
Look, it's white!

703
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,286
Oh my God,
I'm getting a grizzled cooze!

704
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,372
Anyway, you get carte blanche.

705
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,459
OK, then I think
I'll just pop on over at lunch break.

706
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,837
Thanks, Nadia.
I knew I'd be able to count on you.

707
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,756
Mind if I have a shower
as long as I'm here?

708
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:44,676
I was in such a big rush getting out
this morning, I didn't even take a bidet.

709
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,136
That should never happen.

710
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,805
If you must,
put off washing your face, chum.

711
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,516
But before leaving,
always take a bidet.

712
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,519
You never know
what might be coming up.

713
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,740
Yeah? Ah, it's you.

714
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,742
Yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

715
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,935
Hi. I'm glad you came.
I could really use your advice.

716
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,229
Hmm... That's true.

717
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,691
- Turd!
- I don't... Why?

718
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,193
There's a terrific girl
you're treating like scum.

719
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,113
- You don't know what she did to me!
- I certainly do.

720
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,198
I just don't see
where it's such a tragedy.

721
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,951
Well, how should I have handled it?
Give her a medal?

722
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,744
There was no need to do anything.

723
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,706
Look. You've got the most
wonderful girl in the world.

724
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,792
She's classy, she's great.
Worships you.

725
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,961
So why do you stifle her joie de vivre?

726
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:46,381
Because wives are supposed to make
love with their husbands, nobody else.

727
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,091
You dumb-ass moron!

728
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,385
We're talking about
a little affair of no importance.

729
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,679
You can't say that marriage
encompasses the universe,

730
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,557
or that you represent men of all types.

731
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,520
We're not back in the time of your
mother and your father, take a look!

732
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,400
- Would you like Diana to be like her?
- No, of course not.

733
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,945
And anyway I'm the beaten-down one
around here.

734
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,739
What can I do about it?
I'm jealous!

735
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,866
Ah, the facts come out in the light.

736
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:16,328
The real trouble is you're jealous.
It's absurd and useless.

737
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,913
There's no kind of sense to it.

738
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:21,541
Paolo, I could understand your misery,
if she were tired of you.

739
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,545
But no siree. She just wants
minimal liberty, sex-wise.

740
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,006
Just the thing
you've always had, you bum.

741
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,760
That's what's so horrible! The thought
that she laughs with someone else.

742
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,220
That she uses the same little love words
as she does with me!

743
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,765
Who's to know?
She might even come!

744
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,059
No, no, it's more
than I can stand, Nadia.

745
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,644
It's killing me.

746
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,480
I'm beginning to feel
there's a time-bomb inside of me.

747
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,197
A few minutes ago I was asleep
and dreaming that I was with Diana.

748
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:56,451
It was a nightmare.
I tell you, I'm going... I'm going nuts.

749
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,371
I'm with you, Paolo.
I'll prove it, if you like.

750
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,290
I'm very moved. Really, Paolo.

751
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:05,251
Here. Touch me.

752
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,755
Can't you tell how I feel for you?

753
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:16,388
If you only knew how many times
I wanted to feel your hands on me.

754
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,975
Lie down.

755
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:29,109
Oh, goody. I'm glad to see
I don't turn you off.

756
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,449
Don't worry. Really, I mean it.

757
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,869
Nobody's gonna see
any jealous scenes.

758
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:46,001
Diana doesn't mind at all.
She gave me carte blanche.

759
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,504
Diana?
No, no, no, quit it!

760
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,674
- I don't want you. I want Diana!
- Bullshit!

761
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,843
Your cock is calling you a liar!

762
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:58,304
Poor Diana thought
her guy was different.

763
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,433
No way! You're all alike.

764
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,935
Prey to your old-fashioned,
stupid ideas.

765
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,355
Honour, virtuousness, betrayal.

766
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:10,984
And a girl who's liberated
is just a slut, right?

767
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,070
Try to understand, Nadia.
I can't, I won't.

768
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,656
And if I did, it would be like
admitting Diana was right.

769
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,743
She is, you imbecile!
She's very right.

770
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,496
Fighting it is no use.
You silly bastard!

771
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:33,882
I guess the trouble is
you're a... faggot, honey!

772
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:36,009
Your panties.

773
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,433
I've met assholes before,
but men take the cake!

774
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,896
Here's hell to husbands in general,
and ours in particular!

775
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:53,401
Hey, chin up, little sister.
We're out to enjoy life tonight.

776
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,403
Shorten up that long face!

777
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:04,037
My, would you look at him.
Sex on the hoof!

778
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,623
Not bad. Let's take pot luck.

779
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:17,175
- Hey, stud, come here a minute!
- Who, me?

780
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,177
I wonder if you could
give me some information.

781
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:20,762
Sure, what?

782
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:22,597
How are you hung?

783
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:26,142
What the fuck!
Come back here, you cunt!

784
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,144
Just don't let me catch you!

785
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,855
Hi, girls!

786
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,859
Holy mother of God!

787
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:38,822
- What a piece of ass!
- Can't you tell that's a transvestite?

788
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,032
Hey, sweetheart,
are you carrying a dong or not?

789
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:42,909
- You're goddam right.
- Display, please!

790
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:47,914
You got it, but what do you do with it?
It's mighty fine.

791
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,833
I can stick it in your ass,
if you like.

792
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,043
Or I might stick this thing in yours.

793
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:54,629
Cool with me, 20 bills.

794
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:56,965
- Fuck you.
- No, asshole, fuck you!

795
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:01,094
I said it first,
you ugly, pimping, bull-dyke bitch!

796
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,055
You fucking bitches, I'll get you!

797
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,808
When we feel like living it up,
where do we go?

798
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,268
I know a disco, yeah!

799
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,311
We can do better than that,
Mother Superior.

800
01:09:10,437 --> 01:09:12,105
We'll go to a place
where anything can happen.

801
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,899
- Even the worst?
- If you get lucky.

Hey, girls!

826
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,235
I'd like something strong.
What do you have?

827
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:06,863
Try a 'Delirium'.
It'll make a corpse dance.

828
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,740
That's right up my alley.

829
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:13,870
- What's in it?
- Ecstasy.

830
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:12,261
Excuse me, could you
give me some information?

831
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,097
What size are you carrying?

832
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:18,351
You shouldn't have to ask.
The two of you already met each other!

833
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:22,480
The seminarian!
I had a white collar on, in the streetcar.

834
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,273
Gosh, yeah.

835
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,900
Only why are you here?

836
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,318
I'm doing my research.

837
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,946
How can I do a thesis about sin,
and not know what it is?

838
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,864
Viens avec moi!

839
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:48,965
Oh God, I'm gonna scream!
Shriek, bellow!

840
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,094
Ah, I never met a tongue
with a hard-on, you're great!

841
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,400
- Is something the matter?
- No.

842
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,070
Nothing at all.

843
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,127
How's it going?

844
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,129
I'm minus underpants!

845
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:40,386
Give me one of those drinks!

846
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:02,158
Hello? Ah, yeah.
What's the news?

847
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,577
No! Shit, no! Back off!

848
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:07,371
I don't give a fuck
about any guarantee.

849
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:10,374
Just get me the fucking money quick,
or it's your ass!

850
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,049
-  'Hello? Who is it?'
- It's Diana.

851
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:21,927
- 'You at a party?'
- Oh, yeah. It's great fun, fantastic!

852
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:25,723
'Diana, it's 4:00am and you're pissed.
Come back home. '

853
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:29,852
- 'Who's there with you?'
- A wild boy. Oh, wow!

854
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:33,147
A bunch of fabulous men.

855
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:36,275
It's Paolo, guys! Say hi!

856
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,195
Hi, Paolo!

857
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:42,073
How's it sound, dear?

858
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,616
'Stop it!

859
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,077
'I forbid you! I'm your husband!'

860
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:49,830
Nah, you know who you are?
You're a dumb, stupid asshole!

861
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:53,709
And this girl's liberated.
I mean, I can screw the whole planet!

862
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,796
And not only that,
I might not ever come home.

863
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:59,507
'Come back or not, who gives a shit,
you won't find me anyway.

864
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,550
'I'm getting my ass outta here.
I've had it.

865
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,969
'I'll move in with my parents today.

866
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,764
'You understand what I'm saying?
I'm leaving!'

867
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,849
Fine, fine, fine!

868
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:13,187
I can't believe I ever sucked your cock,
you shitface!

869
01:18:13,313 --> 01:18:17,983
So, hurry on to little mama, and...
and screw her!

870
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:23,364
Hey, you need some help?

871
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:46,011
- Have you had it with the party?
- Yeah, he's gonna give me a lift.

872
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:49,473
It's almost dawn,
and besides, I'm worried.

873
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:52,143
Paolo's threatening to move out.

874
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:55,020
Ah, come on, never!
He's too in love, that boy.

875
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,064
- I'm leaving.
- Fine, great.

876
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,774
I'll stay a little more.

877
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,527
I've found a hero of the Resistance!

878
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:53,788
'Think of what you're doing,
Diana. Think of us.

879
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:55,581
'I love you, Paolo.

880
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,334
'PS But do you love me?'

881
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,841
'Dear Marikla,
not only do I love him,

882
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:09,804
'but in my own way
I feel that I'm a faithful wife.

883
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,765
'Going with other men
doesn't mean I'm betraying him.

884
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:16,310
'Those are just casual flings
of no importance at all.

885
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:19,980
'They're great for a quick thrill,

886
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:23,692
'but they have nothing at all to do
with that mixture of body and soul,

887
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:28,030
'that makes my relationship
with Paolo beautiful and unique.

888
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:33,619
'That's why I have no guilt feelings,
no contrition, no remorse.

889
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:37,331
'That's why I don't want
the love we share to finish like this.

890
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:42,920
'But how do I go about making him
understand that? Diana. '

CONFESS ALL TO MARIKLA

'Feelings - Milan. '

893
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:18,205
Hey, Sara! Come here!

894
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,105
Want some? I just caught them.

895
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,567
No. I hate them.

896
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,736
Feel bad, huh?

897
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,614
Just think, you could be
between Diana's legs right now,

898
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,532
instead of sitting here
eating your heart out.

899
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:55,326
What are you getting out of it?

900
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:56,577
Nothing!

901
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,662
Bullshit! You got a hard-on.

902
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,457
He's a goddamn traitor!

903
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:06,462
No, no way. I'll tell you.
Trouble is, he's smarter than you.

904
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,757
He's got his priorities straight, he knows
she gives you everything with love.

905
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,968
He feels that you're acting
like a bit of an asshole.

906
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,971
Yes, because actually,
you should approve of her.

907
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,599
Yeah, you know what that means?
That he's a prick!

908
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:20,267
Thank God!

909
01:22:20,393 --> 01:22:23,270
Anyway what good is it
to destroy yourself with jealousy?

910
01:22:23,396 --> 01:22:25,898
Develop a sense of irony
and have a laugh about it.

911
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:28,233
With Diana.

912
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,570
- Hey there!
- Dig up any clams yet?

913
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:42,581
Hey, I think we should be going.
They must be looking for us.

914
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:47,294
- Come on, this way.
- Hey, wait for me.

915
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,673
- Come on, dinner's ready.
- Wait! I'm coming!

916
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,058
Yes? Who's there?

917
01:23:01,184 --> 01:23:04,186
Hello?
Please fuck yourself in the ear.

918
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:07,982
- Who was that?
- Oh, one of my anonymous admirers.

919
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,359
That's the second time today
they've hung up.

920
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:14,530
He'll come back, don't worry.
Husbands always do, more's the pity!

921
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:20,869
Hello? Paolo?

922
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,038
Well, somebody's breathing.

923
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,667
Paolo? Is that you?

924
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:28,877
Can't you say some little thing?

925
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,715
You're still hoping! What does he have,
this guy, that's so special?

926
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,677
Well, I love him,
there's something special.

927
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,804
But he won't try to understand me.

928
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:42,725
It's his fault for not understanding
that faithfulness is unnatural.

929
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:45,811
Yeah, yeah. But anyhow he's gone.

930
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,898
-  Oh my God, there he is now!
- Who, Paolo?

931
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:54,111
No, not Paolo, it's that Commodore
Scarfatti with his latest piece, er... niece!

932
01:23:54,237 --> 01:23:56,071
That man is so butch
I just can't bear him.

933
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,033
Fine, I'll take the commission.

934
01:24:00,785 --> 01:24:03,537
Hello, Commodore.
Nice to see you again.

935
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:06,457
My dear Antonietta.

936
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,584
This is my long-lost niece, Maria.

937
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,003
Well, your family's remarkable.

938
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,882
- All the nieces are so pretty.
- Good chromosomes.

939
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:17,051
I've told Maria all about your things.

940
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,386
She wants some styles
that are truly intimate.

941
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:23,390
- You do get my meaning?
- I certainly do, Commodore.

942
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:28,604
Now, let's see what we can find.
White, red, black?

943
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,440
Miss, what do you prefer?

944
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,401
What do you think, Uncle?

945
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:39,865
I must ask Antonietta
how she feels about it.

946
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:44,036
Well, I always say
there's nothing like black, myself.

947
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,663
When a person has a light complexion
like your niece,

948
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,832
the effect is sensational.

949
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:52,419
Unless, obviously,
Maria is tanned... here!

950
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,880
Oh, not here, no, never!

951
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:58,258
We'll just try a few of these on now.
OK, Commodore?

952
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,302
Yes. That's fine.

953
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:44,429
Uncle, I don't feel this is right for me,
come take a look.

954
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,849
If you knew how I feel!

955
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:58,527
Let's see.
Hmm, looks a little loose.

956
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,572
- You think?
- Would you be so kind as to show us?

957
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:04,074
Of course, Commodore,
whatever you like.

958
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:10,122
- Ah-ha...
- Now do you see what I mean?

959
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:12,583
It's disgraceful to take advantage
of a young lady like that.

960
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:15,002
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

961
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:19,464
- Unkie!
- All right, panties next.

962
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:22,384
That little lady is older than time.

963
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,304
- Down, down.
-  She knows just what she wants.

964
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,474
That's right, OK. Come on.

965
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,728
And now the denouement, a fast fuck!
If he can manage to do it.

966
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:35,022
He'll manage, he'll manage.
And not just one!

967
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:38,609
It's just evil. Certain perversions
are simply intolerable!

968
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:41,111
It's all in how you look at it.

969
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:44,281
If you could I'd tell you
to find me a 100 customers like him,

970
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,450
and I could retire!

971
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:47,618
Stand up, dear.

972
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,745
I'd shove that guy
and his nieces right in the...

973
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:53,749
I know, dear, I know.
And I know there's plenty of room, hmm!

974
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,668
Do you suppose that
for the Commodore that's love?

975
01:26:56,794 --> 01:27:00,631
Love, you said? He doesn't begin
to understand the meaning of the word.

976
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:03,592
None of you types do,
all you know is sex!

977
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:14,144
Diana my dear, is something wrong?

978
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:17,022
It's a bad period
I just have to get through.

979
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:21,818
- A big fight with Paolo.
- Oh dear, you poor little thing.

980
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,321
You mustn't let the clients
see you like that.

981
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:27,449
That's it. Come to my office.

982
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:30,160
That's a good girl.

983
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,638
Now what is this?
Tell me the whole story.

984
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:52,516
There's not much to tell,
Mister Silvio.

985
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,480
Paolo left me!

986
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:02,150
Oh my poor dear, cry your heart out.
You'll feel better.

987
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:06,154
It's awful. All because I went to bed
with a couple of other guys.

988
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,157
But I'm not sorry I did it.
I mean, I didn't do it to hurt him.

989
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,202
Of course, my dear. I understand.

990
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:15,831
You didn't do anything wrong,
not at all.

991
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,003
Oh, Mister Silvio.
What are you doing?

992
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:25,549
Nothing, relax,
it'll make you all better.

993
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,560
Hey! Wowee!

994
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:39,104
It's him!
I know the sound of that horn.

995
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,106
Diana, where are you going?

996
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,566
Diana, it's Paolo!

997
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:46,611
I told you.
A husband is just like a bad penny!

998
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,875
MR SILVIO IS A PIG

999
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:17,476
So... I suppose your folks
are in good health?

1000
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:20,896
I guess living, but I never went
to their home at all.

1001
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,814
Yeah? I'm surprised.

1002
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:26,193
- I've something to say.
- To me? OK, I'll listen.

1003
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,029
I'll begin by saying
I'll never get over what went on.

1004
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:32,532
You mean to say
something was going on?

1005
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:35,410
I'm serious, Diana.
I'm not joking around, you know!

1006
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:38,121
I know, me too.

1007
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,837
I couldn't leave you.
I was just going out of my head.

1008
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:47,881
Oh, Paolo. I love you, Paolo.

1009
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,009
So I've decided now and for all time...

1010
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:54,471
Live by your own rules.
Go banging and take happiness in it.

1011
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,225
That's how I like
to hear my man talk!

1012
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:03,855
Who the hell gave you that?

1013
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:06,191
Oh, Paolo, you mean old shit!

1014
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,318
Don't get mad.
I just want to know, come on.

1015
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:11,238
Once I would have told you
that it was a boyfriend.

1016
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:14,324
This time around I'll just say
that I bumped into a tree.

1017
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:16,701
Tell me the damn truth, Diana,
I gotta know.

1018
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:20,622
All right, Paolo, the French antiquarian
is completely mad about little me.

1019
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:22,833
You can do better than that.

1020
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:26,169
Cousin Marco, he's arranging
an elopement with me.

1021
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:28,505
Go ahead, torture me.
Get your jollies!

1022
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:32,968
I'll always do everything that pleases you.
And it does, doesn't it?

1023
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,556
Yeah, you're right.
I like you just the way you are.

1024
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,558
I won't ask any more questions.
Not many more, that is.

1025
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,352
From now on, only one truth
is recognised - this!

1026
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,989
That's a great ass,
looks real.

1027
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:56,867
It creates a very fine effect.

1028
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,369
I bet you didn't know
that ass has been restored.

1029
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:01,371
Really? You can't tell.

1030
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:04,499
Well, it had a long crack
right down the middle.

1031
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,754
So, did you like
your first Venetian night?

1032
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,299
- A-OK.
- A-OK?

1033
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,301
Is that the best you can come up with?

1034
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,636
You came up with something better
than that last night, six times too!

1035
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:20,807
- I expect more gratitude than that.
- And I always pay my debts!

1036
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:24,019
No, not now!

1037
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,854
You'll ruin my eye-liner.

1038
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,190
I have to go. I'm late already.

1039
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:30,901
I'd much admire
being let in on the secret.

1040
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,446
Where're you going, done up like that?
Date with cousin Marco?

1041
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:37,699
Truth is, I don't even know
where I'm going.

1042
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:40,076
I just know it's a fabulous day.

1043
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:42,913
Venice beckons me.

1044
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,248
And I'll be happy!

1045
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,044
Goodbye for now.

1046
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:40,428
"I'm so in love with...
with my husband.

1047
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,639
"In my own way
I feel I'm a faithful wife.

1048
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:45,600
"Other men are just casual flings.
That's why I feel no guilt.

1049
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,894
"Believe me, I did nothing wrong.

1050
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:51,231
"But how can I get him to see it?
Diana. "

1051
01:32:56,862 --> 01:32:58,238
"Dear Diana.

1052
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:01,533
"Hundreds of girls write me that they
betray their husbands, but love them.

1053
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,702
"This, as you call it, 'happy banging'

1054
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,538
"is no longer the prerogative
of only the males in our society.

1055
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:08,164
"It belongs to the women too.

1056
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:11,042
"The important thing is for him
not to react with 'jealous banging'... "

1057
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:13,169
'That's why
I always tell my readers:

1058
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:17,007
'Live your marriage as though
it were a movie, not a prize-fight ring.

1059
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:19,884
'Instead of torturing yourselves
body and soul,

1060
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:23,722
'learn to pretend, to act,
to play a part.

1061
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,808
'Obviously many of the women
who write to me know these things,

1062
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,769
'judging by the letters
I'm printing in this issue. '

1063
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,275
'Dear Marikla.
There's a man, he's a widower.

1064
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:38,403
'I work part-time for him as a housemaid,
because I need the money.

1065
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:41,239
'He likes to watch me do
the housework bare-ass naked,

1066
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:42,741
'and I don't mind one bit.

1067
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,660
'I let him touch me,
and sometimes more than that.

1068
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:47,746
'Am I abnormal?'

1069
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:59,215
Venice is an alcove,
more than just a city.

1070
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:03,970
A French poet named it
sexe femelle d'Europe.

1071
01:34:04,096 --> 01:34:07,307
- Alphonse told you.
- Mm-hmm.

1072
01:34:12,563 --> 01:34:16,483
- I love you.
- And me? Don't you love me?

1073
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:22,238
I'll settle for loving... this.

1074
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,749
What about you? Do you love me?

1075
01:34:37,588 --> 01:34:39,839
Can't you tell that I love you?

1076
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,761
That meat's delicate too,
take it easy!

1077
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:49,015
The problem is, I don't know how much
film is left in Aunt Emma's camera!

1078
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:52,143
Forget about the camera,
concentrate on me!

1079
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:57,774
Darling, it's true, we should live
our marriage as though it were a film.

1080
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,944
A precious heirloom
for our grandchildren!
