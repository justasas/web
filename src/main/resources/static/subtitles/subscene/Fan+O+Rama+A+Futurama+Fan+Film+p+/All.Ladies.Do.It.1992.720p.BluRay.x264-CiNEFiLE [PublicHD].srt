- That fiIth?

You just didn't reaIise it,
right there, standing behind the door.

Ah, you're kidding.
It's just another one of your siIIy stories.

- He had me naked in no time.
- Quit that!

109
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,859
He wanted to give it to me in the ass,
if you hadn't shown up right then.

110
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,945
You're inventing everything.
I know it! I'm no idiot!

111

112

How was... how was his thing?

113
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,204
Did he make you feeI it?
Was it as hard as this?

How many times do I have to teII you?
It's the most gorge...

168
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,740

169
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,826
Now I know why you

170
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,578
(Man #2) You're Iucky this is my stop!

171
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,163
(Man #1) Or what,
you wouId've kissed me?

172
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,844

173
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,396
Miss, take my seat. PIease do!

174
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,316
Thanks, no,
my stop is coming up.

175
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,673
Sorry. I'm sorry.

176
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,551
Hey, Iisten. You gotta get
a coupIe of things cIear.

177
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,680
Get the mud out of your upstairs.
I can see it's hard on you.

178
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,099
That IittIe thing might just
ruin your vocation.

179
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,561
- Miss...
- Take my advice, kid. Go confess aII.

180
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,730
How... about a phone caII?

181
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,482
- Do you have my number?
- No.

182
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,026
You're outta Iuck, boy.

183
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,283
So Iong!

184
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,172
Hi, LeIIo.

185
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,925
You're crying, what's the matter?

186
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,512
He's Ieft me.
He's gone back to his wife.

187
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,932
The battIe-axe has the vapours,
and he feeIs guiIty, says it's our fauIt.

188
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,185
- Is that true?
- I shouId know? Perhaps it is.

189
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,562
OnIy with a miIIion guys to pick on,
why pick on my guy?

190
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,565
Now, LeIIo, just get your best drag

191
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,859

ten thousand times better!

192
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,028
- You reaIIy think so?
- Guaranteed.

193
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,452
Hey, your diet, Antonietta!

194
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,790
Like the Iady said, everything I Iike
is either iIIegaI, immoraI, or fattening!

195
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,375
ReaIIy!

196
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,296
Look, I have a terrific surprise
for you!

197
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,675
It gave me some ideas
for a reaIIy memorabIe night with Pierre.

198
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,886
- Is there a new way, huh?
- The Atom Bomb, just try it!

199
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,853
You're just dying
to take it home with you, LeIIo!

200
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,814
I bought six Iike it yesterday,

201

00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,539
HeIIo, kids, hard at work?
That's fine.

204
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,874
(AII) Hi, Mr SiIvio.

205
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,752
(Mr SiIvio) Oh, Antonietta,

Oh, that's reaIIy very nice of you.

Er... the rest of you can take a break.

212
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,944
Come here.

213
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,238
Lean back.

214
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,119
Ah, yes.

215
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,499
Let me see the one on the right today.

00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,375
Let me see aII of you.

Now bend this Ieg a IittIe.

219
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,848
And turn around now.

220

That's it.

00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,410
and I thought of you right away!

225
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,287
(Antonietta) I'm reaIIy flattered.

- Good morning, aII. HeIIo, Diana.
- HeIIo, Mrs Tommasini.

229
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,818
You seem to be dressed
in mourning, though.

230
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,529
I am, unfortunateIy.
I Iost my IittIe Danny.

231
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,407
Oh, I'm terribIy sorry.
Somebody very cIose?

232
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,367
Oh, yes, intimate.

233
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,661
We'd been together for ages.
He was a wonderfuI Iabrador.

234
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,038
Ah... I imagine.

235
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,707
And how's your husband,
the Senator?

236
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,418
In France eating foiegras
and fighting hunger in the worId.

237
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,712
Have you prepared those articIes
as I asked you?

238
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,338
Of course.

239
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,465
I can't wait to fiII up my drawers.

240
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,930
Let's try these.

241
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,308
But they're the same ones
you chose Iast Thursday.

242
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,186
I'm no idiot,
I stick with what works weII.

243
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,479
They wound up ripped into shreds.

An engineer?
Your newest conquest, huh?

246
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,154
No, but one of the most generous.
Cartier!

247
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,323
Gosh. CongratuIations.

248
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,701
Oh weII, at Ieast I'm never bored
in the afternoons.

249
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,703
I've found a IittIe group of friends.

250
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,581
I was introduced by AIicia.
She's a cIient of yours.

251
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,541
AIicia? Oh, I know, Mrs Dow.

252
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,543
Right, the one they caII Mrs Sow.

253
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,880
Doctors, Iawyers, undersecretaries.
You make great money.

254
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,007
If you're interested,
I'II taIk to her about you.

255
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:22,511
Oh, gee, thanks a Iot, but I...
I just don't think I couId reaIIy, I mean...

257
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,307
Come on, honey,
this isn't what you think it is.

258
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,478
I'm not reaIIy a pro. FiIIs in spare time!
And pIenty of Iadies do it.

259
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,815
Anyway, reaI whores never come.
I do, Iike an avaIanche!

260
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,484
Oh, men have great imagination.

261

I Iearn something nice and quirky
on aImost every date!

262
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,155
You mean that wouIdn't interest you?

263
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,741
My husband has imagination enough.

264
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:47,870
Oh, mine doesn't! How inventive can
an envoy to the European ParIiament be?

265
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,039
Oh, but it's so romantic
to meet someone unknown,

266
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,208
in some hoteI room, in an apartment.

267
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,751
Your heart goes Iike mad.

268
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,796
It's an adventure of the unknown,
it's marveIIous!

269
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,215
And then the thriII
of feeIing yourseIf up for saIe!

270
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:03,094
Oh, the shame, the sin...
I'd give it a whirI, if I were you.

271
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,805
I must say I reaIIy think
I ought to pass on...

272
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,932
I know a ChiIean bishop
who'd simpIy adore you.

273
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,727
- Priests have never been my ideaI.
- They're the best customers, beIieve me!

274
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,480
- AII right, I'II take a gross.
- OK, great!

275
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,404
Mrs Tommasini is reaIIy very nice.

276
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,114
She's a big success in what she does,

277
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,659
which is actuaIIy something Iike what I do,
if you want to know the truth.

278
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,494
In there getting porked, yes.

279
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,455
My precious favours
in return for a raise in pay.

280
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,916
My husband isn't sorry,
and neither am I.

281
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,209
Do you mean that?

282
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,211
WeII, he doesn't know
aII the detaiIs, of course.

283
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,629
No guiIt about it, for Pierre?

284
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,340
PIease, I'm not in Iove
with this oId geezer.

285
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,968
But you're stiII betraying
your husband, aren't you?

I don't see
how you got that in your mind.

287

Come on, don't pIay so dumb!

288
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,473
It's not easy to define.

289
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,601
With Pierre it's speciaI -
there's tenderness, and more.

290

a poke is a picnic!

OK, I'II keep it in mind, thanks.

00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,495
I don't know how you can bring yourseIf
to do those things with the boss.

295

Just for openers, he's ugIy as sin.

296
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,584
I'm not gonna cry over that.
There's my handsome Mister Pierre.

297
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,544
And there's something speciaI
with the ugIies.

298
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,504
They're so much more generous
than the pretties.

299
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,758
Fact is, they need to have us girIs
pardon their homeIiness, aII the time.

300

- I guess.
- Some peopIe caII it wicked.

301
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,512
It's big fun, though.

302
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,557
When I make it with the boss,
I feeI Iike I'm screwing my own dad.

303
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,351
So... big deaI!

Happy banging I say!

- Oh, come on, there's no danger.

use the most naturaI of methods.

311

- There's someone here to see you.
- Oh, yes, yes. Thank you.

312

funeraI, and don't worry about us.

00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,602
I'm sorry, darIing,
I wish I couId go with you,

329
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,272
but this is a bad time,
I'm up to my neck in work.

330
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,900
Don't worry. I'm a big girI.
I can handIe it on my own.

331
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,362
I'm worried about your fideIity.
You know how sexy funeraIs are.

332
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:12,908
- PaoIo, that's crazy!
- It's an estabIished historicaI fact.

333
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,869
A funeraI atmosphere creates,
on its own,

334
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,788
a contrasting,
compensating desire to screw.

335
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,749
It says so in an articIe on aduItery
I've been reading.

336
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,418
Do you know that statistics show

337
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,588
that over 60% of ItaIian wives
cheat on their husbands?

338
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,677
- Hey, what the heII's this?
- Antonietta gave it to me.

339
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,971
What kind of a crowd
do you run around with?

340
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,639
PeopIe who aren't ashamed
of what they do.

341
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,851
Not up-tight oId frumps Iike you.
Let's take a Iook at it.

342
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,394
If you insist.

343
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,918
(TV) 'Come in, pIease.
Is the gentIeman with you?'

344
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,294
'He's my husband.

345
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,963
- 'Wait here, wiII you, darIing?'
- 'Of course, dear.'

346
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,760
Oh, that's nice, oh yes.

347
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,514
- Mm... Iike that.
- (TV) 'Get undressed, pIease.'

348
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,559
Further down, to the right.

(TV) 'Panties too, pIease.'

350
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,248
You're off target, Jack.

(TV) 'Sit down here.

352
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,924
'Open wide.'

353
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,052
WeII, what do you think?

354
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,931
When you go to the gynaecoIogist,
I mean does he, er...?

355
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,435
(Laughs) That man?
But he's at Ieast 90!

356
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,688
Supposing he was
a young and handsome guy?

357
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,065
WeII, it depends. I couIdn't say.

358
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,651
(TV) - 'Doctor, what are you doing?'
- 'Just doing myjob, ma'am.

359
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,653
'Now reIax and Iet me concentrate.'

360
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,406
WouId it upset you a Iot if I did?

361
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,116
I'd be furious as heII, dammit!

362
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,829
And you'd have
no other type of reaction?

363
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,332
I... I'd be excited!

364
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,627
You know, that even goes on
at the store, aII the time.

365
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,796
It's our boss, what a horny man!

366
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,840
He paws me
every singIe minute, honest!

367
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,175
Oh yeah? Where does he paw you?

368
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,304
AII over - my tits, my ass...

369
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,640
He was even grabbing a feeI
whiIe he was saying his condoIences.

370
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,019
What a swine!
How about you, how did you react?

371
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,771
You just stood there, I bet!
Come on, teII me.

372
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,440
I got carried away.

373
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,984
I wound up being dragged
into the back room.

374
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,653
Yeah? Then what did he do to you?
TeII me!

375
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,697
He threw me down on the tabIe.

376
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,533
He opened my Iegs,
and he touched me right on the button.

377
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,327
- You mean here, don't you?
- Yeah.

378
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,704
- Like that?
- Yes, Iike that.

379
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,997
Then what?

380
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:09,084
Then he turned me around
and made me bend forward.

381
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,757
(TV) 'Oh, fuck! What a cock!

382
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,259
'Give it to me! AII of it!

383
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,474
- 'Rip my ass apart!'
- Higher up, darIing, higher up!

384
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,351
PIease!

385
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,479
I can't take it!
It's your fauIt, you IittIe sow!

386
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,898
That imagination of yours
excites me too much!

387
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,227
You couId both do a Iady a favour today.

388
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,730
Sure, it'd be a pIeasure.

389
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:56,483
I'm very wiIIing to pay.
ShaII we say a miIIion Iire?

390
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,444
But to do what, though?

391
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,612
I want you to heIp me.

392
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,197
It's so crueI.

393
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,575
My ass is stiII a virgin.
WouId you...?

394
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,702
Money to do it? Nah...

395
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,788
I know it's incurabIy romantic,
but this guy says "no go".

396
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,114
I'm in mourning.
WouId you pIease not act so uncouth?

397
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,991
(Man cIears throat)

398
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,712
(Woman) Subject to an absoIuteIy binding
cIause by whose terms he wiII be enjoined

399
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,257
from putting up new buiIdings
or additionaI floors to the existing ones,

400
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,301
I bequeath to Marco VaIentini,

401
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,971
son of my brother Luigi VaIentini
and therefore my Iegitimate nephew,

402
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,807
the property of ViIIa di Mira...

403
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,225
She was aIways so seIfish!

404
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,769
...of which he has cIear
and free titIe IegaIIy.

405
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,021
Is she kidding, that oId ruin?

406
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,607
It'II onIy take 60 times what it's worth
to fix it up!

407
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,025
Item!

408
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,528
I bequeath to Diana Bruni,

409
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,698
daughter of the Iate Giovanna VaIentini
and therefore my Iegitimate niece

410
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,827
my property consisting
of the top floor of the buiIding...

411
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,497
- Oh!
- ...at 1477 Giudecca, OId Town.

412
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,500
In its present condition
and with everything inside it

413
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,127
such as is to be found
at the moment of my decease.

414
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,089
You have aII the Iuck.
It's just what I wanted to get my cIaws on.

415
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,091
It was going to be
my pied-a-terre in Venice!

416
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,342
CIause three.

417
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,386
I do hereby take
aII my other properties

418
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,264
and aII my gifts and incomes
accruing thereto,

419
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,934
as weII as my cash account and bonds in
branch number six of the Bank of Venice

420
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,521
and Ieave them to the convent of
the CarmeIite Nuns in Vittorio Veneto,

421
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,440
- whom I supported ferventIy aII my Iife.
- God bIess her.

422
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,317
Your signatures.

423
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,951
You Iook great.

424
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,329
- The air in Rome!
- Thanks.

425
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,790
I'm going to take a Iook at the penthouse.
Do you want to see it?

426
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,960
That's impossibIe, Marco.
We have guests tonight.

427
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,713
Don't worry about a thing, Nora.
You go on back to Padova.

428
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:27,175
I'II go aIong with Diana
and I'II be home in time for dinner.

429
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,013
Once again, pIease.

430
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,516
Father, you sign down
at the bottom of the page.

431
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,767
The Iast shaII be the first.

432
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,563
- I'm gIad you came aIong with me.
- Strange Iady, Aunt Emma.

433
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,273
She Iiked us a Iot, you and me.

434
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,484
ActuaIIy, of aII the reIatives, I'm the one
that spent the Ieast time with her.

435
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,570
- But you knew about her?
- WeII, sure.

436
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,739
At Ieast the things the famiIy said.

437
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,242
Discreet, organised, inteIIigent...
above aII, skiIfuI.

438
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,161
SkiIfuI? In what sense?

439
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:58,290
SkiIfuI in bed, two or three Iovers
at a time, maybe four.

440
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,711
The right men though, staIwart citizens,
fuII of cash and possibiIities.

441
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,297
They heIped her
make her money grow.

442
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,799
As it turned out,
she Iearned her Iessons very weII.

443
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,928
For herseIf and for us,
as we heard in her wiII.

444
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,304
How about UncIe Harry?

445
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,766
A mystery! Did he know about
her infideIities or didn't he?

446
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,726
Did he Iike it, or was it kiIIing him?

447
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,438
WeII, I stiII think he was reaIIy
never interested in women.

448
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,691
But one thing's for sure,
Emma was aIways gaga over him.

449
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,778
And if he were aIive today,
we wouIdn't have inherited a thing.

450
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,115
What?

451
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,872
Don't worry, nobody's gonna take
your penthouse away from you, Diana.

452
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,291
It's yours, and you can do
whatever you want with it.

453
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,087
Who knows? I couId run into you
in Venice from time to time.

454
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,507
CertainIy you wiII.

455
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,510
- How's it going with you and Nora?
- How about with you and PaoIo?

456
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,136
Stupendous!

457
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,305
- Does he know about us?
- Know what, Marco?

458
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,182
That I had you before him,

459
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,768
that in bed you and I did
everything you can do.

460
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,687
You think so?

461
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,773
My dear,
I have some bad news for you!

462
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,693
Come on, move it, Marco.

463
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,028
I feeI Iike going up
to the tip of the Dogana.

464
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,698
- Do you remember?
- How couId I forget?

465
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:40,392
You're a habit, you.
I need more and more.

466
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,853
(Diana) I used caII you the Erector Set.

467
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,355
(Marco) You used to say
my Erector Set.

468
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,566
There's stiII the same
stink of pee here as aIways.

469
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,943
I bet with aII the tourists,
even the Iadies take a Ieak.

470
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,530
(Marco) Spread your Iegs.
I can't make any headway Iike that.

471
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,907
(Diana) You just don't have
the technique you once did.

472
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,744
No, you've just forgotten
how to do it standing up.

473
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,122
I was sure.

474
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,791
Yes, her comments
were quite uncaIIed-for.

475
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,169
She's Iearned nothing
after aII these years.

476
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,260
Hey, what is this? You're not going
to Ieave me high and dry, are you?

477
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,722
Let's go to my house.
We can do it in styIe and comfort there.

478
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,432
You mean Aunt Emma's penthouse.

479
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,142
That house is mine!

480
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,353
Oh, I've decided I'm not going back.
I'II stay tiII tomorrow.

481
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,398
I want to spend
the first night in my house.

482
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,776
Yeah, but I've got to get back home.

483
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,736
We have these guests
coming for dinner.

484
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:36,406
Ah, as far as that goes,
I toId PaoIo that I'd return tonight.

485
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,794
No, Diana.
I simpIy can't do it. I can't.

486
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,797
No sweat, we'II make it
for some other time.

487
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,883
I'm going to make good use
of my house in Venice, yeah!

488
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,384
(Ferry boat horn)

489
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,637
Marco, that's the ferry boat
for the station.

490
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,597
If you run you can make it!

491
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,433
Listen, Diana. Do you swear
you'II Iet me see the new house?

492
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,310
Sure!

493
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,229
I swear it.

494
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,940
But you got to hurry. Hurry!

495
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:15,445
So Iong!

496
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,677
My God!

497
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,056
Who wouId have expected this?

498
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,521
You were a truII, Aunt Em!

499
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,899
(Gasps)

500
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,279
(Laughs)

501
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,202
WeII, it's sure to have cost you
a Iot of bIowjobs, this penthouse!

502
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,834
DarIing Aunt Emma,
you're just sensationaI!

503
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,214
I Iove you more with every snapshot!

504
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:14,345
I did promise PaoIo I'd caII.
Wonder if the phone works?

505
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,993
Donatien, AIphonse.

506
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,757
'Allô, oui?'

507
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:54,594
Morning, couId I pIease speak
with AIphonse Donatien?

508
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,054
'C'est moi.'

509
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,598
Ah, you might not recaII,

510
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:02,227
Diana Bruni, you and I met
at someone's house in Rome

511
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,103
at the party to meet the poetess?

512
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,398
'Ah, oui, the IoveIy Iady
I struck up a conversation with.

513
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,983
'Where are you caIIing from?'

514
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:12,862
Oh, Venice, I was Ieft a smaII apartment
that I'd Iike redecorated.

515
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,614
'And that is why
you thought of me?'

516
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,492
PartIy, after aII, you said...

517
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,286
'I'm deIighted that you did!
Let's taIk about it, come on over.'

518
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,081
Come on over? Where?

519
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,042
'To my pIace, right now.
PaIazzo Lorenzoni. It's easy to find.

520
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,169
'Just two steps
for the Embarcadero Ca' Rezzonico.'

521
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,380
I know Venice, I know where it is.

522
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,591
- 'Then hurry, pIease!'
- I'II be seeing you.

523
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,710
Oh, it's coId!

524
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,326
WeIcome!

525
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,204
- Bright star.
- HeIIo.

526
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,874
Er... haven't we
aIready met somewhere?

527
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,544
FIesh Iies Ianguid.

528
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:18,089
The mouth has its own empiricist.

529
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:22,135
Turgid, behind, it rejoices
in the Iacerated flesh.

530
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,098
This is more than strange.
It's preposterous.

531
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:32,437
Go on in.
AIphonse is waiting for you.

532
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,921
STREET OF THE FUCKABLES

533
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,132
Bonsoir!

534
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,178
You found the pIace
with very IittIe effort, huh?

535
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,679
Sure.

536
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,517
You were with that poetess?

537
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,895
Oh, oui.

538
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,897
Just work.

539
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,483
At this hour of the night?

540
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,528
And you, didn't you come here for that?

541
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,952
Ever since that night,
it's been Iike this.

542
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,443
The house of marveIs?

543
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:07,156
Wait tiII we go upstairs,
then you'II see.

544
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:11,285
- To paradise?
- Inferno. My inferno.

545
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,384
Uh-oh...

546
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,025
Anytime...

547
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,528
- Show me how to get there.
- No, you go first.

548
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,906
I want to admire your ass,
ton cul.

549
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:11,596
Is this aII right?
Or do you want to see more?

550
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,602
Come on! Come get me!

551
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,645
(Laughs)

552
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,219
My word!

553
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,972
It must have taken you quite some time
to coIIect aII of these.

554
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,892
Oh, I started earIy, with that one!

555
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,730
It's my ex-wife.

556
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,650
It's a very expressive face, I find.

557
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,485
Ah, oui.

558
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:13,282
From her I Iearned that the physiognomy
of a person is aII in the nates! lci!

559
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,619
This is a portrait gaIIery.

560
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:20,373
You can distinguish the timid ass,
the brave one, the stupid one,

561
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:25,002
the cIever, the inteIIigent,
Iazy, happy, sad, carefree.

562
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,506
Everyone is the ass that he has.

563
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,341
Oh.

564
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,972
So what am I?

565
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,516
Voyons...

566
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,984
Headstrong, wiIfuI and disobedient.

567
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:53,698
But stiII a IittIe uptight,
cIosed, introverted.

568
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,742
Am I hopeIess, Doc?

569
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,829
Not if you can pIay by the ruIes.

570
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,831
Let's hear the ruIes.

571
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:05,626
You must foIIow orders and do for me
everything I want.

572
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,087
If you cry out, I stop.

573
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,840
Everything, at your command?

574
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,425
Right.

575
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,052
- Down on aII fours, over there.
- Why?

576
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:19,140
Oh, it's because the game has
aIready started, and you know it!

577
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,883
FeeI him!

578
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:40,137
No... oh, how strong and proud!

579
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,099
- It's gonna hurt me, isn't it?
- Cry out and I'II stop!

580
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,601
It's up to you.

581
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,745
I'm so scared!

582
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,664
Do what I teII you...

583
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,916
and it wiII aII be naturaI.

584
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:10,751
Breathe deep!

585
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,379
As if you were in chiId birth,
in Iabour.

586
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,881
Breathe with me!

587
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,937
Good.

588
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,941
Come on!

589
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,279
(Diana screams)

590
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,574
- Was that a scream, Diana?
- No. I broke through the canvas, though.

591
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,328
Oh, don't worry. C'estpas grave.
I'II have it restored.

592
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,840
L'enculeur... du monde!

593
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,808
(Antonietta) 'Happy banging I say!'

594
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,935
(Laughs)

595
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,520
A FRIAR ONCE TOLD ME

596
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,939
ONE OF HIS BIGGEST PLEASURES
WAS TO MAKE A WOMAN BELIEVE

597
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,941
THAT HER ASS WAS NOT
MADE FOR SHITTING

598
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,152
NO, HER ASS WAS
SO DIVINE AND PRECIOUS

599
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,654
AND COULD MAKE MEN HAPPY
AND THUS AVOID ADULTERY

600
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,250
(PaoIo) IncredibIe.

601
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,087
That fur piece was stiII
hanging up in the cIoset.

602
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,465
I found some snapshots, too.

603
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,927
(PaoIo) Dear oId Aunt Emma.
Who wouId ever have guessed?

604
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,638
(Diana) The apartment is stiII
just the way you see it there.

605
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,890
Nothing's changed at aII.

606
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,309
It's mind-boggIing, you know?

607
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:54,021
You shouId see the view out the window,
the whoIe skyIine of Venice.

608
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,358
For a young coupIe in Iove
that pIace is Paradise.

609
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,443
- Yeah, we put it up for rent.
- What?

610
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,904
I was going to keep it
for the two of us.

611
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,031
We're a young coupIe in Iove.

612
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,450
- Aren't we, darIing?
- Uh-huh.

613
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,419
That's something new - you've shaved.

614
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,879
I've just indented the margins a IittIe.

615
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,675
I have to be a demure and virtuous Iady.
After aII, I'm an heiress.

616
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,011
That'II be the day, oh yeah!

617
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,722
What an insuIt!

618
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,978
Auntie Emma got you excited, huh?

619
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,817
- I guess I shouId be jeaIous.
- I'm the one who ought to be jeaIous!

620
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,737
TeII me the truth, your cousin came over
to see the apartment, didn't he?

621
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,072
Of course he came over.

622
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,658
Marco wouIdn't Iet
a chance Iike that go by.

623
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,368
Did he make a pass at you?

624
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:35,998
WeII, he began to taIk about when
the two of us used to go out together.

625
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,708
TeII me.

626
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,502
We'd go up to the tip of the Dogana,

627
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,672
and he'd touch my IittIe flower
under my skirt,

628
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:47,259
- and I'd put my hand on him.
- Show me how you did it.

629
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,766
CarefuI there,
that meat's deIicate!

630
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,769
He'd grab my head
and get it right down,

631
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,229
cos he wanted me
to take it in the mouth.

632
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,773
What did you do?

633
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,609
WeII, I put up a struggIe, of course,

634
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,611
but aIways a very brief one.

635
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,365
And did you do it again yesterday,
in your apartment on the Giudecca?

636
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,325
Mm-hmm.

637
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,351
Great fantasies you've got.

638
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,561
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,605
I know you and Marco
didn't do a thing, right?

640
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,148
One for you.

641
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:46,026
I decided to take advantage
of good oId AIphonse instead.

642
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,779
Another gent? Who is he?

643
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,323
That French guy at the party
who I danced with.

644
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,827
I bet you inaugurated the apartment
Iike that, huh?

645
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,746
No, at his pIace.

646
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:00,165
BeautifuI decor.

647
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,918
OK, give me the detaiIs.
Come on, come on.

648
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,963
He was crazy for my ass.

649
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,632
He had to have it, no matter what.

650
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,343
I couIdn't have avoided it
even if I'd wanted to.

651
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:15,681
He spread my ass and started
Iicking my crack, down and up.

652
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,559
But it isn't so painfuI.

653
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,936
I couId be persuaded.

654
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:27,568
- And did you...?
- Did I? Like an express train!

655
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,157
What's the matter?
Why do you want me to stop?

656
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,242
- Who gave that hickey to you?
- Huh?

657
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,036
- That hickey on your neck!
- I don't know what you mean.

658
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,165
I thought you were making up
one of your stories, but you reaIIy did it!

659
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,625
No, pIease, Iet me expIain.
Listen to me!

660
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,961
No, it isn't a fantasy this time.
He fucked you!

661
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,463
That bastard prick fucked you!

662
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,799
No, PaoIo, I swear it.
He didn't fuck me at aII!

663
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,176
I took it up the ass.

664
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,480
(Door sIams)

665
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:22,789
PIease, darIing, don't pout.

666
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:26,001
- Better to taIk it over, huh?
- Get away from me!

667
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,546
We've aIways had a good Iaugh
over my IittIe affairs.

668
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,008
You toId me they made you horny.
You Iiked that just sweII.

669
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,801
Because they weren't true!

670
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,387
There's no difference,
it doesn't matter in the Ieast.

671
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,015
I'm reaIIy onIy yours.

672
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,893
Is it so naughty
if I make it with somebody eIse?

673
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,188
I mean it's aII...
happy banging, right?

674
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:50,609
No, no, count me out! I don't want
any part of your happy banging!

675
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,362
I guess it seems Iike
the end of the worId to you right now,

676
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,989
but you'II see, tomorrow...

677
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,701
Don't get near me.

678
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,912
We're history, the past.

679
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,039
There never wiII be
a tomorrow for us.

680
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:14,466
I'm not going to share my marriage bed
with someone Iike you, you sIut!

681
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,683
I shouIdn't be surprised after aII.

682
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,228
BIood wiII teII,
but yours shouId be spiIIed!

683
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,822
Hey, you Iook aII queer.

684
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,700
- Thanks to PaoIo. Big fight.
- Beyond repair?

685
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,494
WeII, he wants a separation.

686
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,872
No kidding! Another woman?

687
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,833
No, something other than that.
A man.

688
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,002
- PaoIo?
- No, me!

689
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,545
It was a guy in Venice.

690
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:36,840
Oh, reaIIy!
You know, you had me scared.

691
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,218
Turns are up!
Let me get these broads outta here.

692
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,553
Head for the showers!

693
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,306
OK, I want to hear aII the detaiIs.

694
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,936
- Woo!
- Don't do that.

695
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:56,193
Why in God's name did you teII him?
That's just asking for it.

696
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,403
WeII, we were onIyjoking around.

697
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,323
It was just what they caII
a zipIess fuck anyway.

698
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,371
Are you simpIy a sIut orjust dumb?

699
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,750
AII men are reaIIy stupid pigs,
oiIy and nasty.

700
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,377
The ruIe is to deny.

701
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,879
Deny everything
in the face of the evidence.

702
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,715
Oh, they aII preach equaIity of the sexes,
you can bet on it.

703
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,052
But no one practises it.
They're worms, aII of them.

704
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,054
I don't want it to end up Iike this.

705
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,973
I was aIone in bed Iast night
and couIdn't sIeep a wink.

706
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,226
The best thing is
to get a fresh maIe bod in there.

707
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,727
Who does PaoIo think he is?

708
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,895
It's reaIIy simpIe.

709
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,857
No woman can be satisfied
through the 360-degree circIe.

710
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,736
Not by one man -
each man has his own different taste.

711
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,530
And a girI needs to taste a Iot.

712
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,365
You prattIe and bIather,

713
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,076
but the truth is, you got kicked out
by your husband, Nadia.

714
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,661
What's that? PIease, kid,

715
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,747
there's a bIack and bIue ass
in this story aII right, but it's his.

716
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,792
No, no, no, come on,
that's farcicaI.

717
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:57,879
Listen, I'II waIk humbIe,
onIy I must get him back, that's aII.

718
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,340
- And you're gonna heIp me.
- Just how, my dear?

719
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:03,468
Have a chat with him.
Show him he's wrong.

720
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:07,013
- Make him Iisten to reason.
- BriIIiant of you!

721
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,517
He has to reaIise that
the others just don't count.

722
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,853
And if he won't Iisten to me?

723
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,856
No, he trusts you.
He thinks a Iot of you.

724
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,399
PIease, Nadia.

725
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,862
Do I have carte bIanche?

726
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,156
Just how do you...
how do you mean?

727
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,742
Look, it's white!

728
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,286
Oh my God,
I'm getting a grizzIed cooze!

729
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,372
Anyway, you get carte bIanche.

730
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,459
OK, then I think
I'II just pop on over at Iunch break.

731
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,837
Thanks, Nadia.
I knew I'd be abIe to count on you.

732
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,756
Mind if I have a shower
as Iong as I'm here?

733
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:44,676
I was in such a big rush getting out
this morning, I didn't even take a bidet.

734
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,136
That shouId never happen.

735
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,805
If you must,
put off washing your face, chum.

736
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,516
But before Ieaving,
aIways take a bidet.

737
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,519
You never know
what might be coming up.

738
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,771
(Intercom buzzes)

739
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,740
Yeah? Ah, it's you.

740
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:50,742
Yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

741
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,679
(DoorbeII rings)

742
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,935
Hi. I'm gIad you came.
I couId reaIIy use your advice.

743
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,229
Hmm... That's true.

744
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,691
- Turd!
- I don't... Why?

745
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,193
There's a terrific girI
you're treating Iike scum.

746
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,113
- You don't know what she did to me!
- I certainIy do.

747
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,198
I just don't see
where it's such a tragedy.

748
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,951
WeII, how shouId I have handIed it?
Give her a medaI?

749
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:34,744
There was no need to do anything.

750
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,706
Look. You've got the most
wonderfuI girI in the worId.

751
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,792
She's cIassy, she's great.
Worships you.

752
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,961
So why do you stifle her joie de vivre ?

753
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:46,381
Because wives are supposed to make
Iove with their husbands, nobody eIse.

754
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:48,091
You dumb-ass moron!

755
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,385
We're taIking about
a IittIe affair of no importance.

756
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,679
You can't say that marriage
encompasses the universe,

757
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,557
or that you represent men of aII types.

758
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,520
We're not back in the time of your
mother and your father, take a Iook!

759
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,400
- WouId you Iike Diana to be Iike her?
- No, of course not.

760
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,945
And anyway I'm the beaten-down one
around here.

761
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,739
What can I do about it?
I'm jeaIous!

762
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,866
Ah, the facts come out in the Iight.

763
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:16,328
The reaI troubIe is you're jeaIous.
It's absurd and useIess.

764
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,913
There's no kind of sense to it.

765
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:21,541
PaoIo, I couId understand your misery,
if she were tired of you.

766
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:25,545
But no siree. She just wants
minimaI Iiberty, sex-wise.

767
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:28,006
Just the thing
you've aIways had, you bum.

768
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,760
That's what's so horribIe! The thought
that she Iaughs with someone eIse.

769
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,220
That she uses the same IittIe Iove words
as she does with me!

770
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,765
Who's to know?
She might even come!

771
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,059
No, no, it's more
than I can stand, Nadia.

772
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,644
It's kiIIing me.

773
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,480
I'm beginning to feeI
there's a time-bomb inside of me.

774
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:52,197
A few minutes ago I was asIeep
and dreaming that I was with Diana.

775
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:56,451
It was a nightmare.
I teII you, I'm going... I'm going nuts.

776
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,371
I'm with you, PaoIo.
I'II prove it, if you Iike.

777
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,290
I'm very moved. ReaIIy, PaoIo.

778
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:05,251
Here. Touch me.

779
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,755
Can't you teII how I feeI for you?

780
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:16,388
If you onIy knew how many times
I wanted to feeI your hands on me.

781
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:19,975
Lie down.

782
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:29,109
Oh, goody. I'm gIad to see
I don't turn you off.

783
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,449
Don't worry. ReaIIy, I mean it.

784
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,869
Nobody's gonna see
anyjeaIous scenes.

785
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:46,001
Diana doesn't mind at aII.
She gave me carte bIanche.

786
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,504
Diana?
No, no, no, quit it!

787
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,674
- I don't want you. I want Diana!
- BuIIshit!

788
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,843
Your cock is caIIing you a Iiar!

789
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:58,304
Poor Diana thought
her guy was different.

790
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,433
No way! You're aII aIike.

791
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,935
Prey to your oId-fashioned,
stupid ideas.

792
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,355
Honour, virtuousness, betrayaI.

793
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:10,984
And a girI who's Iiberated
is just a sIut, right?

794
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,070
Try to understand, Nadia.
I can't, I won't.

795
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,656
And if I did, it wouId be Iike
admitting Diana was right.

796
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,743
She is, you imbeciIe!
She's very right.

797
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,496
Fighting it is no use.
You siIIy bastard!

798
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:33,882
I guess the troubIe is
you're a... faggot, honey!

799
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:36,009
Your panties.

800
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,433
I've met asshoIes before,
but men take the cake!

801
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,896
Here's heII to husbands in generaI,
and ours in particuIar!

802
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:53,401
Hey, chin up, IittIe sister.
We're out to enjoy Iife tonight.

803
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,403
Shorten up that Iong face!

804
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:04,037
My, wouId you Iook at him.
Sex on the hoof!

805
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,623
Not bad. Let's take pot Iuck.

806
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:17,175
- Hey, stud, come here a minute!
- Who, me?

807
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,177
I wonder if you couId
give me some information.

808
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:20,762
Sure, what?

809
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:22,597
How are you hung?

810
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:26,142
What the fuck!
Come back here, you cunt!

811
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,144
Just don't Iet me catch you!

812
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,855
Hi, girIs!

813
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,859
HoIy mother of God!

814
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:38,822
- What a piece of ass!

What do you think, UncIe?

980
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:39,865
I must ask Antonietta
how she feeIs about it.

981
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:44,036
WeII, I aIways say
there's nothing Iike bIack, myseIf.

982
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,663
When a person has a Iight compIexion
Iike your niece,

983
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,832
the effect is sensationaI.

984
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:52,419
UnIess, obviousIy,
Maria is tanned... here!

985
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,880
Oh, not here, no, never!

986
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:58,258
We'II just try a few of these on now.
OK, Commodore?

987
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,302
Yes. That's fine.

988
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,387
(♪ ItaIian opera pIays)

989
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:44,429
UncIe, I don't feeI this is right for me,
come take a Iook.

990
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,849
If you knew how I feeI!

991
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:58,527
Let's see.
Hmm, Iooks a IittIe Ioose.

992
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,572
- You think?
- WouId you be so kind as to show us?

993
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:04,074
Of course, Commodore,
whatever you Iike.

994
01:26:06,953 --> 01:26:10,122
- Ah-ha...
- Now do you see what I mean?

995
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:12,583
It's disgracefuI to take advantage
of a young Iady Iike that.

996
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:15,002
WeII, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

997
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:19,464
- Unkie!
- AII right, panties next.

998
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:22,384
That IittIe Iady is oIder than time.

999
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,304
- Down, down.
- (SiIvio) She knows just what she wants.

1000
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,474
(Scarfatti) That's right, OK. Come on.

1001
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,728
And now the denouement, a fast fuck!
If he can manage to do it.

1002
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:35,022
He'II manage, he'II manage.
And not just one!

1003
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:38,609
It's just eviI. Certain perversions
are simpIy intoIerabIe!

1004
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:41,111
It's aII in how you Iook at it.

1005
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:44,281
If you couId I'd teII you
to find me a 100 customers Iike him,

1006
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,450
and I couId retire!

1007
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:47,618
Stand up, dear.

1008
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,745
I'd shove that guy
and his nieces right in the...

1009
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:53,749
I know, dear, I know.
And I know there's pIenty of room, hmm!

1010
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,668
Do you suppose that
for the Commodore that's Iove?

1011
01:26:56,794 --> 01:27:00,631
Love, you said? He doesn't begin
to understand the meaning of the word.

1012
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:03,592
None of you types do,
aII you know is sex!

1013
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:14,144
Diana my dear, is something wrong?

1014
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:17,022
It's a bad period
I just have to get through.

1015
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:21,818
- A big fight with PaoIo.
- Oh dear, you poor IittIe thing.

1016
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,321
You mustn't Iet the cIients
see you Iike that.

1017
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:27,449
That's it. Come to my office.

1018
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:30,160
That's a good girI.

1019
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,638
Now what is this?
TeII me the whoIe story.

1020
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:52,516
There's not much to teII,
Mister SiIvio.

1021
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,019
(Sobs)

1022
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,480
PaoIo Ieft me!

1023
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:02,150
Oh my poor dear, cry your heart out.
You'II feeI better.

1024
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:06,154
It's awfuI. AII because I went to bed
with a coupIe of other guys.

1025
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:09,157
But I'm not sorry I did it.
I mean, I didn't do it to hurt him.

1026
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,202
Of course, my dear. I understand.

1027
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:15,831
You didn't do anything wrong,
not at aII.

1028
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,003
Oh, Mister SiIvio.
What are you doing?

1029
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:25,549
Nothing, reIax,
it'II make you aII better.

1030
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:32,889
(Car horn)

1031
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,560
Hey! Wowee!

1032
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:39,104
It's him!
I know the sound of that horn.

1033
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,106
Diana, where are you going?

1034
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,566
Diana, it's PaoIo!

1035
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:46,611
I toId you.
A husband is just Iike a bad penny!

1036
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,875
MR SILVIO IS A PIG

1037
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:17,476
So... I suppose your foIks
are in good heaIth?

1038
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:20,896
I guess Iiving, but I never went
to their home at aII.

1039
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,814
Yeah? I'm surprised.

1040
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:26,193
- I've something to say.
- To me? OK, I'II Iisten.

1041
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,029
I'II begin by saying
I'II never get over what went on.

1042
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:32,532
You mean to say
something was going on?

1043
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:35,410
I'm serious, Diana.
I'm not joking around, you know!

1044
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:38,121
I know, me too.

1045
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:45,837
I couIdn't Ieave you.
I was just going out of my head.

1046
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:47,881
Oh, PaoIo. I Iove you, PaoIo.

1047
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,009
So I've decided now and for aII time...

1048
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:54,471
Live by your own ruIes.
Go banging and take happiness in it.

1049
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,225
That's how I Iike
to hear my man taIk!

1050
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:03,855
Who the heII gave you that?

1051
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:06,191
Oh, PaoIo, you mean oId shit!

1052
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,318
Don't get mad.
I just want to know, come on.

1053
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:11,238
Once I wouId have toId you
that it was a boyfriend.

1054
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:14,324
This time around I'II just say
that I bumped into a tree.

1055
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:16,701
TeII me the damn truth, Diana,
I gotta know.

1056
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:20,622
AII right, PaoIo, the French antiquarian
is compIeteIy mad about IittIe me.

1057
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:22,833
You can do better than that.

1058
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:26,169
Cousin Marco, he's arranging
an eIopement with me.

1059
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:28,505
Go ahead, torture me.
Get yourjoIIies!

1060
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:32,968
I'II aIways do everything that pIeases you.
And it does, doesn't it?

1061
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,556
Yeah, you're right.
I Iike you just the way you are.

1062
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,558
I won't ask any more questions.
Not many more, that is.

1063
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:42,352
From now on, onIy one truth
is recognised - this!

1064
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:43,979
(Diana Iaughs)

1065
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,989
(PaoIo) That's a great ass,
Iooks reaI.

1066
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:56,867
It creates a very fine effect.

1067
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,369
I bet you didn't know
that ass has been restored.

1068
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:01,371
ReaIIy? You can't teII.

1069
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:04,499
WeII, it had a Iong crack
right down the middIe.

1070
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,754
So, did you Iike
your first Venetian night?

1071
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,299
- A-OK.
- A-OK?

1072
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,301
Is that the best you can come up with?

1073
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,636
You came up with something better
than that Iast night, six times too!

1074
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:20,807
- I expect more gratitude than that.
- And I aIways pay my debts!

1075
01:31:21,684 --> 01:31:24,019
No, not now!

1076
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:25,854
You'II ruin my eye-Iiner.

1077
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:28,190
I have to go. I'm Iate aIready.

1078
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:30,901
I'd much admire
being Iet in on the secret.

1079
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:34,446
Where're you going, done up Iike that?
Date with cousin Marco?

1080
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:37,699
Truth is, I don't even know
where I'm going.

1081
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:40,076
I just know it's a fabuIous day.

1082
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:42,913
Venice beckons me.

1083
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,248
And I'II be happy!

1084
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,044
Goodbye for now.
