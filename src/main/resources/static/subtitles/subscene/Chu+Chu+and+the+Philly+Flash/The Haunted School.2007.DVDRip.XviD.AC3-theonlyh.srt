1
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,868
Falling in love is not allowed in school

2
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,473
Tonight at 11 p.m.

3
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,486
A No. 3 alarm fire broke out

4
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,545
at the Narranmoda Memorial School

5
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:08,055
One of the 2 casualties

6
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,129
is the wife of the school Principal

7
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,893
Someone is still up there!

8
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,026
Sir...

9
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,263
You can't go up there

10
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,463
Someone is still up there!

11
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,005
Sir

12
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,363
Calm down!

13
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,035
There's no one up there. The firemen have checked

14
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,133
Calm down!

15
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,806
Was in the office...

16
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,106
Trust me!

17
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,497
The school is haunted!

18
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,604
Ho Yiu Leung please report
to the school office now

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,878
I was a student of Narranmoda Memorial School

20
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:09,418
That night I was preparing for the School Open Day

21
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,616
We were working late

22
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,226
Suddenly a student was summoned to the office

23
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,594
I have never seen that office before

24
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,360
It doesn't exist

25
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,459
20 years later

26
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,660
Are you sure? How of them?
How many of them are accepted?

27
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,364
Got four

28
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,593
My God! That's not enough!

29
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,602
Wait! Are they in boarding school?

30
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,103
I think so...

31
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:03,232
Shit! I need time to get ready

32
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,571
What for?

33
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,235
I...

34
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,347
Don't you dare!

35
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,343
Yat-Man

36
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,487
Is it true? There will have 4 boys in our school?

37
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,080
I'm on duty now. Don't be silly!

38
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,025
Come on! Please tell me, I can't wait

39
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:23,254
Yes!

40
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,024
Are they cute? How do they look like?

41
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,189
Go check by yourself

42
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,597
Let's go!

43
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,925
Where are they?

44
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,626
In the school office

45
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,335
We have an impeccable record all along the time

46
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,306
If now we have the 4 boys in our school

47
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,105
I can't imagine what is going to happen

48
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:44,081
Nowadays many schools have gone co-ed

49
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,445
Why can't we do the same?

50
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,348
We just can't

51
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,286
You're over reacting, Miss Fong

52
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,326
We need students to keep the school going

53
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,027
I'm putting you in charge

54
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,157
Please keep an eye on them

55
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,662
I'd better get ready

56
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,273
Bye!

57
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,641
Call me!

58
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,311
We're roommates again!

59
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,579
We're in the same room!

60
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,711
Me too!

61
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,420
Me too!

62
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,127
Your skirt is more than 2 inches above the knees

63
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,993
You broke the school rule!

64
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,233
How about this?

65
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,274
What are you eating?

66
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,641
Nothing

67
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,603
Miss Fong...

68
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,376
Ho Yat-Man, please come with me

69
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:59,046
Good morning teachers and students

70
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,251
Welcome to a new school term

71
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:06,799
This year is our school's 30th anniversary

72
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,505
I hope you'll adhere to the school's motto

73
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:18,441
Confucius once said...

74
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,077
Shit!

75
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,511
Mobile phone is not allowed in the classroom

76
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,276
Put it away!

77
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,183
My name is Dick, and you?

78
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,788
Let's get to know each other

79
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,183
My name is Lau Chek-bun

80
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:36,193
Ko Hon-keung and me were old classmates

81
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,121
What's your name?

82
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,793
Li Kwok-chung, call me Charlie. And you?

83
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,660
What's your name?

84
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,237
Ho Yat-Man

85
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,399
That's a nice name

86
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,635
Where are you going? To the toilet!

87
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,643
Wait for me!

88
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,304
Let's go!

89
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,842
Why must you follow us to the toilet?

90
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,649
Hurry back!

91
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,151
It depends...

92
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,748
What the heck! Where is it?

93
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,690
This is a girls' school

94
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,786
Not anymore

95
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,797
We're like unwelcome here

96
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,357
I won't be leaving

97
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,696
Hey, let's take a look over there

98
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,266
Alright...

99
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,781
Let's look at the menu

100
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:41,691
What menu?

101
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,422
Come on, idiot!

102
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,907
Thanks principal for giving
a significant instruction

103
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,849
Now I have an announcement to make

104
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,515
Our school will be different this year

105
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,354
We will have 4 boys in the school

106
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,489
Quiet... please be quiet!

107
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,363
I'm sure you'll remember

108
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,929
Our school main objective is to have
a good learning atmosphere...

109
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,163
Over here!

110
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,402
Keep a simple school spirit

111
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,709
and carry out our motto of pursuing the truth

112
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,549
You cannot...

113
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,778
You're not allowed to...

114
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,558
Quiet please!

115
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:57,234
Quiet please!

116
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,368
I know him! It's Ben!

117
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,530
Our school rule Fong-fong

118
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,268
Falling in love is not allowed

119
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:23,924
Falling in love is not allowed

120
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,772
$1,000 for this dorm?!

121
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,309
The girls' dorm looks much better

122
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,002
Are there any vacancies?

123
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,802
That's none of your business

124
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,677
The girls' dorm is off limits to you

125
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,718
You'll be expelled right away
if you break the rule

126
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,515
The superintendent must sure go to sleep...

127
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,419
That's me!

128
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,821
Normally I sleep late

129
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,325
Dare you to try?

130
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,728
Is there any boys' toilet here?

131
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,493
Yes, but not in use for a long time

132
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,000
We're cleaning it up now

133
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,294
I heard there's a haunted toilet here

134
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,770
It wouldn't be the same one, right?

135
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,029
Don't be stupid! That's nothing to do with us,

136
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,436
The school is not haunted

137
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,441
Here's a copy of the school rules

138
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,537
Memorize them by heart

139
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,412
Don't be late for class tomorrow

140
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,650
Any question?

141
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,615
If not, I'm leaving

142
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,757
Goodbye, Miss Fong

143
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,999
Have you heard any stories of this school?

144
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,798
Well no need to worry! Let's go!

145
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,462
Where are we going? What do we do next?

146
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,976
During lunch, there must be
lots of food in the canteen

147
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,704
Cool! Let's go!

148
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,768
Wait... let me put this down first

149
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,075
OK...

150
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,613
Before I forget

151
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,418
Your meals will be brought to you everyday

152
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,086
The canteen is also off-limits!

153
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,626
What? That's a jail sentence!

154
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:10,566
You either choose to withdraw or go by the rules

155
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,728
Better not break the Rule No. 2

156
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,036
I don't want to kick you out so soon

157
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:36,556
Let me out...

158
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,073
Come on! Tell me or I will
make you drink this shampoo

159
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,015
No...

160
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,143
Have you held Ben's hand before?

161
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,580
Or kiss him?

162
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,519
No!

163
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,993
He's just a classmate from grade school

164
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,016
Were you in love with him?

165
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,619
Tell me the truth or eat this soap!

166
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,096
You're so vicious!

167
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,860
I have never in love with him before

168
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,628
Fancy meeting you here

169
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,672
We have to prepare something for it, right?

170
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,536
See, here you are,

171
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,632
Spiral style sensation

172
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,144
This is from the U.S.! Thanks!

173
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,179
You knew it well,
You seem like the first one to use it

174
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,047
Why?

175
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,642
What about that Fong-fong?

176
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,152
She's my classmate from grade school

177
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,945
Didn't expect to run into her here

178
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,045
Do you have large size?

179
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,422
You don't need a large!

180
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,754
Give me back, idiot!

181
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,658
Hey, catch it!

182
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,194
You...

183
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,658
Try this, Yat-Man

184
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,668
It's an essence mask

185
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,499
I don't need it

186
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,129
Look! So dehydrated you are!

187
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:58,165
Use it after you shower, it's moisturizing

188
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,207
Cat puts this on her buttocks too!

189
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,879
I don't!

190
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,675
Try it!

191
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:16,720
Why were you with those boys today?

192
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,129
Miss Fong asked me to keep an eye on them

193
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,065
You were blushing

194
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,193
No, I was not! I just fell down

195
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,838
Did they touch you?

196
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,636
What?

197
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,175
It's normal, especially when you all fall down

198
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,746
I think Ko Hon-keung is cute

199
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,821
I'll take him if you don't

200
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,789
I'm interested in him! Just leave him to me

201
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,860
You can't compete! With what?

202
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,526
What's wrong with you?

203
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,693
Please don't force me to do anything to
you as you keep smoking over here!

204
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,264
Yat-Man, please don't do that!

205
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,030
Don't let her copy homework anymore

206
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,102
Ben, I need the laptop for my notes

207
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,679
Can I have it back?

208
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,042
School starts tomorrow!

209
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,639
Lay off your studies!

210
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,686
Have you ever been in love, Charlie?

211
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,080
You want a good start?

212
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,960
I don't mind to have a try

213
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,761
Practice makes perfect!

214
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,133
Then you must follow our words to do

215
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,172
Come here! Learn this good stuff

216
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,906
This was really an unbelievable movement!

217
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,137
That's nothing special

218
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,543
I have something better

219
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,012
Let's watch it together

220
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,309
Really? So Dick,

221
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,051
from now on other than Ko Hon-keung,

222
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,881
You're my buddy

223
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,580
Same here!

224
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,261
You can't smoke in here!

225
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,224
Mind your own business!

226
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,303
Please! I can't take smoke

227
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,334
Please smoke outside

228
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,341
Please...

229
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,338
We can't go out

230
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,980
after 11 p.m.

231
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,246
I'm already taking it outside

232
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,150
Shut your mouth!

233
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,720
My nose...

234
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:55,379
Miss Chung will be your home room teacher

235
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,245
Miss Fong, why are there only four of us here?

236
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,981
Because you're the only ones in the class

237
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,280
4 is good

238
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,322
We can focus on our studies

239
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,748
Next class is PE lesson

240
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,747
I'll be your PE teacher

241
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,314
Great!

242
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,724
Let's go

243
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,155
Where are you going?

244
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,249
Look at them

245
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,522
They are fumy

246
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,518
I go to toilet

247
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,254
Make it quick!

248
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,463
Why hula hoops? We should play volleyball

249
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,983
Shit!

250
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,113
Who is it?

251
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,125
Did you drop your cigarette?

252
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,793
Which one of us

253
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,297
is in the wrong toilet?

254
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,027
We're only in here to take a drag

255
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,331
Here, have one on me

256
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,382
I'm Dick, you are...?

257
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:19,248
Call me Si. You're from the boys' dorm?

258
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:26,491
That Miss Fong is a maniac!

259
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,426
Here you go!

260
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,000
I said it's my treat

261
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,542
I didn't ask for your number

262
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,102
Call me when you want to have fun,

263
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,511
Will see then...

264
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,316
Give me your number too

265
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:50,411
We can chat or SMS for keeping in touch

266
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,153
Si...

267
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,127
Si...

268
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:16,364
Go...

269
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,112
Are you alright?

270
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,404
Damn! Just left without a word!

271
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:16,998
Wow! So muscular and handsome

272
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,533
Miss... Let's go! The Head prefect is coming

273
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,400
That petite one is cute

274
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,564
Too short!

275
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,073
She suits you, Charlie

276
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,768
Go get her number...

277
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,306
What? Now?

278
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,579
Where are you going? Time for lunch!

279
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,445
Very well!

280
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,520
Let's eat!

281
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,785
What the hell is that?

282
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,030
Don't waste your food!

283
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,390
No, Keung

284
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,057
This pork chop is awful!

285
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,429
It's cold, stiff and salty!

286
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,560
You try this!

287
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,136
We have to complain to Miss Fong

288
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,113
Let him do the talking

289
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,411
Keung, you must talk to her

290
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,453
I really can't take this pork chop

291
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,456
Sometimes I really feel like we're in a zoo

292
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,500
It's alright! Just take it easy!

293
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,564
Who threw me the banana?

294
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,402
Fong-fong? You want me to eat this?

295
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,272
No! Look at it!

296
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,401
I'd rather look at you

297
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,536
Teacher is coming No

298
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,511
Call me!

299
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,272
What were they doing when you arrived?

300
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,250
Waiting for their food

301
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,582
Remember! From now on

302
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,157
I want to know

303
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,522
all their moves

304
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,719
I'll expel them

305
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,694
if they break the rules

306
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,663
I don't think it's a good idea...

307
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,170
Listen to me, Ho Yat-Man

308
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:39,471
There's a reason for every rule

309
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:43,510
You must listen to me, understand?

310
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,563
It must be 4, alright?

311
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,197
I'm going to practice boxing

312
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,552
She's gone!

313
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,180
Take your buddies to the forest

314
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,192
Let me talk to him!
Please do it with low profile,

315
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:32,429
If Keung can't make it,

316
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,896
the deal is off! Bye!

317
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,426
Don't say that! It's misleading!

318
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,968
You'll thank me for it!

319
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,703
Show me the stock!

320
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,899
You'll get fat, stupid!

321
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,342
That's not enough for you!

322
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,938
I'll go out for a smoke

323
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:50,879
Don't forget to dress up yourself nicely,

324
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,383
See you later! Bye!

325
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:53,678
OK

326
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,215
Are you coming?

327
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,379
You'd better not go

328
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,979
The deal will be off if you don't go!

329
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,658
Fong-fong is bringing 2 girls
to our welcoming party

330
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,456
That's a great chance

331
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,224
Don't screw it up please!

332
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,891
They're being friendly

333
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,991
Don't be such a prig

334
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,563
I'm talking to you

335
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,800
Please look at me!

336
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,470
Don't be such a party pooper

337
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,781
Take it easy

338
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:28,512
Keung, I ain't with Dick on this

339
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,281
But we just want some fun

340
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,380
It's not a crime! Come on!

341
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:35,985
Do you have a DC?

342
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,489
Yes

343
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,496
What are you doing here?

344
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,033
I didn't set foot inside

345
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:53,334
and it's before 11 p.m. I didn't break any rules

346
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,991
What do you want?

347
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,761
I came for you...

348
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,963
What for?

349
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,328
I wanted to tell you something

350
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,525
But didn't get the chance

351
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,693
612 I have nothing to say to you

352
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:22,730
Stay right there or I'll get Miss Fong

353
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,772
I'm here to talk to Ho Yat-Man

354
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,311
Listen up, everybody!

355
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,776
Just say what you want!

356
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,023
When I first met you

357
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,025
I felt you are pretty

358
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,560
Although you're pretentious

359
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,857
I knew you didn't mean to be

360
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,531
That's none of your business

361
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,536
Everyone also wants to get out
of that hideous uniform

362
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:56,505
And put on make-up to meet guys, right?

363
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,003
Are you done?

364
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,351
We can give it a try

365
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,505
What do you mean by that?

366
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,138
It means I hate snitches

367
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,138
I heard what Miss Fong and
you were talking in the forest

368
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,437
If any one of us gets kicked out

369
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,539
Everyone will get a copy of that picture

370
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,049
Don't you dare!

371
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,486
Want me to try?

372
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,383
Let's go!

373
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,355
Where are we going?

374
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,383
We're having a party with your pals

375
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:53,123
I'm warning you, Cat and Fong-fong are nice girls

376
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,456
Leave them alone!

377
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,158
They won't leave us alone!

378
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,925
I'll feel safer if you join us

379
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,868
Forget your punching bag

380
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,532
Do what normal girls do

381
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,673
You only live once!

382
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,019
There was a big fire 20 years ago

383
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,112
The disciplinary master died in the fire

384
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,454
but they never found her body

385
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,928
Soon after that, the Principal

386
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,193
hung himself on a tree

387
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,094
Which one?

388
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,467
That one right there!

389
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,965
Why did we still come here?

390
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,101
The most dangerous place is the safest

391
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,838
No one will look for us here

392
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,573
And it's just a rumor

393
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,205
Who knows if it's true?

394
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,218
Don't be scared!

395
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,120
I want to know more. Please carry on

396
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,747
Since then, the intercom kept summoning someone

397
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:58,488
to report to the school office

398
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,655
People who went there

399
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,701
either disappeared or were
found dead in the toilet

400
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,634
Some even jumped down from the school building,

401
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,036
Cat please report to the school office now!

402
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,498
You scared me!

403
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,701
Let's go if you scared!

404
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,676
You're late!

405
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:14,643
I brought you something

406
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,646
What?

407
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:17,739
Yat-Man!

408
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:18,714
Shit!

409
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,513
We ran into them

410
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:21,778
And just looked for a late snack

411
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,080
Don't tell Miss Fong

412
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,053
Please...

413
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,522
Why so scared? You see ghost?!

414
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,819
It is great that the head prefect comes to join us

415
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,895
So let's have fun!

416
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,553
Ben, what have you done to her?

417
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,030
She'll be taking my orders from now on

418
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,902
Let's take a picture for proof...

419
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,265
No, I mean as a souvenir

420
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,835
Take a photo

421
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,532
You didn't take that right, did you?

422
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,771
You told me not to, it was just the flash

423
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,814
Get in line!

424
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,084
1... 2... 3

425
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,114
You broke the rule, go!

426
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:06,953
Hurry up!

427
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:07,896
Come on...

428
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:08,830
1510

429
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,765
10 All

430
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,166
5... 10

431
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,998
What do you want?

432
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:14,936
One more time...

433
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:15,803
I go first, listen

434
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,864
10... 5

435
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,877
Forget it, I'll take this swig

436
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,876
Cool! What a drinker!

437
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,775
I never thought of doing this

438
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:32,789
by challenging the school rules over here

439
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:37,616
The most dangerous place is the safest

440
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,718
Don't you know that?

441
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:43,291
There's a girl jumped down from the top and died

442
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,867
Even Miss Fong wouldn't come here

443
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,298
Is that true?

444
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,733
Of course! Do you know where she died?

445
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,297
Where?

446
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,070
Right here!

447
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,042
Don't scare me!

448
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,014
Hey! Stop... it's late, let's go

449
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,713
No, I'm just getting started

450
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,348
Let's go, before you get out of hand

451
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,182
Let's stay for awhile more

452
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:12,730
No, let's play that again tomorrow night

453
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,690
Hey! Stop it...

454
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,066
You expect me to hit the brakes now?

455
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,067
I have a boyfriend! Stop it!

456
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,613
You're lucky I fancy you, bitch

457
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,205
I maybe a slut, but I draw the line with you

458
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,306
Crazy

459
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,079
Come back!

460
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,237
Don't fool me around, bitch!

461
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:21,423
Go, hurry up!

462
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,432
Dick Chi-hang, report to the school office

463
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,836
School office! There is somebody there!

464
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:41,284
Hello! I'm here!

465
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:47,120
Dick Chi-hang, report to the school office now,

466
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,182
Dick Chi-hang

467
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,230
Come in

468
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,066
Principal

469
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,406
Thank you

470
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,906
About Dick Chi-hang's disappearance

471
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,278
I hope you'll keep it to yourselves

472
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,508
These officers are from Missing Person Unit

473
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,181
They want to ask you a few questions

474
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,352
It's odd, Dick left his things in the dorm

475
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,829
Where did he go?

476
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:09,365
No need to care about him

477
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,560
The officer also said that he's a druggie

478
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,098
Maybe he's too high and sneaked out

479
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,899
until he couldn't find his way home

480
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,908
Step aside...

481
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,133
Step aside...

482
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,168
Ben! Call an ambulance!

483
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,543
Sure...

484
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:37,019
Help me

485
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,561
Patients who are in a coma for over 20 years

486
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,097
seldom regain consciousness

487
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,399
You have to prepare

488
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,332
She's still in a bit of a daze

489
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,042
There she is!

490
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,350
Auntie!

491
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,391
It's me, Siu-yee!

492
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,935
Auntie!

493
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,005
Talk to her

494
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,666
It might be helped

495
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:26,466
Excuse me

496
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:57,638
Are you alright, Auntie?

497
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,715
Why so secretive? Exchanging gifts with Charlie?

498
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,121
No! I just borrow reference book from him

499
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,783
Just don't want anyone to misunderstand

500
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,627
You two are being naughty!

501
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,563
You're always on the phone! It must have something

502
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,525
It's the Head Prefect!

503
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,035
Did you get it?

504
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,641
Told you he's dedicated!

505
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,810
What a surprise...

506
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,746
They're not match at all! Let's go

507
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,287
Yat-man

508
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,822
What is it?

509
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,218
Look!

510
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,058
I'd like to hear what you have to say,
the school is...

511
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,826
Cut the bullshit!

512
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,658
I knew you want to expel me

513
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,100
It's all my faults

514
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,727
I'll take the fall, OK?

515
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,298
You think this is the triad deal

516
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,740
Even the triad can be reasonable!

517
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,367
Call up the Education Board

518
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:18,175
Is it a crime to take pictures
with a fellow classmate?

519
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,204
Look at this picture!

520
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,184
I didn't kiss her

521
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,845
She'll never let someone like me to kiss her

522
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:33,460
I want you to mop the floor after school

523
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,657
I'm not punishing you for the picture

524
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,394
It's your attitude

525
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,469
I have no right to stop you from taking pictures

526
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,268
I just don't want you to be regretful

527
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,767
This is obviously a prank

528
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,346
I'll punish whoever sent this

529
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:55,477
I wanted to see you because
I want to know who did that

530
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,884
Do you know?

531
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:10,723
Yat-man, tell me!

532
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:17,604
You'll be punished for withholding information

533
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,236
I don't know!

534
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,869
I thought you'd named Si

535
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,847
Miss Fong is very nice!

536
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,823
I was even worse than Si

537
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,453
before Form 3

538
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:16,729
I almost got kicked out for picking a fight

539
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,963
But Miss Fong was on my side

540
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,598
So you practice with a punching bag?

541
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,799
I need to ease my stress

542
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:30,838
Some people really had it coming

543
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,227
Thanks!

544
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,000
For what?

545
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:59,005
For taking the fall!

546
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,378
That's the least I can do

547
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,281
I don't want to be punched by you

548
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,318
Were you in the triad?

549
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,486
I don't know about before

550
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,723
But now I'm definitely not

551
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,025
You handle this floor

552
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,426
I'll take care of the downstairs

553
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:41,374
Rule No. 2, no smoking and drinking

554
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:49,392
Light out and in bed by 11 p.m.

555
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:54,353
No loitering

556
00:43:55,866 --> 00:44:06,071
Rule No. 3, the following are off-limits...

557
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,538
Rule No. 4...

558
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,944
Dick!

559
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,947
What are you doing?

560
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:31,863
Help...

561
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,330
Dick!

562
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,103
What are you doing?

563
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:54,786
Yat-Man, Miss Fong expelled Si

564
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:03,556
Help...

565
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,598
Si, don't

566
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,608
Yat-Man has nothing to do with this

567
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,143
Nothing to do with her?

568
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,810
She's Miss Fong's running dog

569
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:18,814
She blabbed about my smoking,
drinking and my skirt

570
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:23,410
And I am the person who sent out that picture

571
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,045
Get out of the kitchen if you can't stand the heat

572
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:45,830
What you want to play on?

573
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,764
I'll go all the way with her

574
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,840
I'll strip her clothes and take pictures

575
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,533
Leave her naked on the stairway

576
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,577
Let people have a feast tomorrow

577
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,667
I want to scare her up only

578
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,543
Are you crazy?

579
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,740
Leave me alone!

580
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,143
Don't do this!

581
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,410
Stay out of this!

582
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:02,746
Stop it!

583
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:13,691
Lai Hei-si, report to the school office!

584
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,264
I thought you said the school is empty

585
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,992
It should be no one here

586
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:23,606
Lai Hei-si, report to the school office!

587
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,699
Who is it? Come out!

588
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,707
Man... we'd better go

589
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,646
I've never seen this school office

590
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,842
Are you crazy?

591
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,944
That was just a story!

592
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,256
Man, let's go!

593
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,889
Get lost!

594
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:07,215
It's just a room! How scary could it be?

595
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,326
Si! It's me!

596
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,624
Sorry! I was just kidding

597
00:48:57,734 --> 00:48:58,792
You brought me here?

598
00:48:58,835 --> 00:48:59,824
Don't take me to the school office

599
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,768
What school office?

600
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,704
No! The school office... no!

601
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:03,830
Calm down!

602
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,273
Follow me!

603
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,943
Sit down!

604
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,314
Wait here! Don't go away!

605
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,949
Don't go! Someone was calling my name

606
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,187
I told Man not to go, but he didn't listen

607
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,729
Wait here! I go get you some water

608
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,030
Who's Man?

609
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:35,364
My boyfriend...

610
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,802
Remember, don't open the doors

611
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,639
Don't go to the school office

612
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,906
What did you say?

613
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:14,273
Si...

614
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,938
Why are you here?

615
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,743
I saw someone coming in, so come and check it out

616
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,249
Did you see Si and her boyfriend?

617
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,080
No!

618
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,450
What happened?

619
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,413
I don't really know

620
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,891
They're missing

621
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,756
Help me look for them

622
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,396
Why there's two more shadow here?

623
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,807
Haunted Tales of Narranmoda Memorial School

624
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,784
Fong-fong couldn't find Si

625
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:59,114
Her mother hasn't seen her for the last few days

626
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,158
You saw her that night?

627
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:09,323
I don't know, I only know one thing

628
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,425
Someone knocked me out while I was boxing

629
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,930
and took me to the sick room

630
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:19,375
Then whoever did this disappeared

631
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:20,936
Every time someone disappeared

632
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,137
there will be a new shadow on the wall

633
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,846
Did Si see that missing school office?

634
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,944
What did you found from the internet?

635
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,821
Just some old stories

636
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,289
Shadows on the wall

637
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:39,393
and the hanging... wait!

638
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,762
Abide by school rules within the school

639
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,062
Falling in love is strictly prohibited

640
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:50,469
Run away if summoned to the school office

641
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,906
Whoever finds the inexistent school office

642
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,102
Burn it down at once

643
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,035
Chapter 20 of the "Book of Revelation"

644
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,104
And the devil that deceived them was
cast into the lake of fire and brimstone

645
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,115
where the beast and the false prophet are

646
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,116
and shall be tormented day
and night forever and ever

647
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,082
A Narranmoda Memorial School former student

648
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,109
I heard about this website before

649
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,251
but it was terribly done

650
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,414
Everyone thought it was a joke

651
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,424
We'll find out soon

652
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,506
Time to eat!

653
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,976
He has a sweet lunchbox

654
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,204
We have pork chops everyday

655
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,212
Thanks, Yat-man!

656
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,386
I don't feel like eating

657
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,616
Let's eat, I share mine with you

658
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,050
That's better

659
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,353
You don't want this, let me have it

660
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,121
Whatever...

661
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,588
Shit!

662
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,158
You have sashimi for lunch!

663
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,432
I meant to share it, but not now

664
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,574
This is from Cat!

665
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,201
Thanks

666
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,293
Cat is a smart girl

667
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,428
I know, Honey

668
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,600
No matter what

669
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,670
I'm doing this for her own good

670
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,471
I understand. She gets distracted easily

671
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,914
She should focus on her studies

672
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:17,077
I found her a school in Canada

673
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,689
Why is this happening?

674
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,529
Let's go...

675
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,653
Go

676
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,598
Why?

677
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:04,024
He's still crying. Ben is with him now

678
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,362
How's Cat?

679
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:12,534
She's packing up, and crying too

680
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:18,542
I told Miss Fong about them

681
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,310
I know

682
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,414
Am I wrong?

683
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:35,621
I'm scared! I don't want anything to happen to Cat

684
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:40,301
Will they be summoned to the school office?

685
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,770
I've never believed in it

686
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:49,344
But now I realize it has something wrong

687
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,642
I just want to tell you something

688
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,448
Sometimes things have happened

689
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,248
No one or nothing can stop it

690
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,548
So just don't let it happen

691
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,124
It's totally out of control

692
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,320
Maybe you don't even know it has happened

693
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,601
Charlie went to the girls' dorm,

694
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:20,803
Cat!

695
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:22,734
It's Charlie!

696
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,040
Cat! Come out!

697
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,637
I need talk to you!

698
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,619
I don't care if Miss Fong expels me

699
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,382
I really need talk to you

700
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,261
All I did was just study

701
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,354
I haven't tried anything at all

702
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,727
I don't know what's going on
for the past few months

703
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,265
But I know now

704
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:53,100
That's something happened between us

705
00:56:53,843 --> 00:57:01,443
Or else we won't play, laugh and cry together

706
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,656
If nothing happened between us

707
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,250
a simple goodbye is good enough

708
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,189
Why did you just write me a letter? Why?

709
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:27,472
Come out, Cat! I'll pretend
I've never read that letter

710
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:30,808
Come out and tell me what's going on

711
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,876
Come out and say goodbye!

712
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,791
I don't know

713
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,263
I just know

714
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,392
it was something very, very special...

715
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,494
I mean it

716
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,630
Cat

717
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,539
Shit! Don't make it public!

718
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,613
No...

719
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:50,488
Charlie...

720
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,386
Where are we?

721
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,224
I don't know!

722
00:58:54,330 --> 00:59:01,600
No gambling, drinking or smoking

723
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:10,237
Lights out and in bed by 11 p.m.

724
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,778
No loitering

725
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:18,351
Why are you here, Si?

726
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:28,490
You two are well behaved,
why both of you were here?

727
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,793
We also don't know

728
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:36,534
You both must have broken the rules

729
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:41,299
So did I... The disciplinary master said

730
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,905
I can go if I copy the rules 100 times

731
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:49,007
I'm working on it

732
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:52,652
I can go soon

733
00:59:54,824 --> 01:00:00,319
Rule No. 4, school uniform is a spiritual symbol

734
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:05,458
All students must be neat and tidy

735
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:11,935
The skirt can't be more than
two inches above the knees

736
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:19,773
Anyone who broke the rules will
need to face the punishment

737
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:04,316
The skirt can't be more than
2 inches above the knees

738
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,453
I broke the rules

739
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,326
Run!

740
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:10,423
I'll never do it again... I broke the rules

741
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:16,863
Run!

742
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,816
Why you come back?

743
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:30,613
What now?

744
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,545
No...

745
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:37,859
No... I've been copying the rules...

746
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,756
Why did you break the rules?

747
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,526
I didn't... I really didn't

748
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:45,465
I didn't...

749
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,527
Yes we did

750
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,538
We broke the Rule No. 1

751
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,938
We have fallen in love

752
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,741
Don't be scared!

753
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,045
Cat

754
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,683
Come down!

755
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:10,781
Cat, don't scare me!

756
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:11,953
Please come down!

757
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:16,760
I broke the rules,
The disciplinary master wants to punish me

758
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,925
No, she won't! Please come down!

759
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,525
Come on!

760
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,968
No, she's standing behind me...

761
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,907
She's standing behind me...

762
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,016
Cat

763
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,559
Call the police!

764
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,423
Please don't die! Ben, call the police!

765
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,828
Do something!

766
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,974
Charlie

767
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:04,840
Why?

768
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:10,075
She's back!

769
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:05,266
Who killed Charlie and Cat?

770
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,267
Miss Fong, on that night

771
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,706
I heard you said "She's back"

772
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,715
Who's back?

773
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,979
The psychiatrist has already explained

774
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:24,024
You're all under too much pressure

775
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:28,755
It was a collective hallucination

776
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:34,770
Bullshit! Cat and Charlie were dead!

777
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,006
Right in front of us

778
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,837
That's not a hallucination!

779
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:46,572
Please, Miss Fong!

780
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:02,161
My Auntie was the school's music teacher

781
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,798
She was also the Principal's wife

782
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,674
She set the big fire 20 years ago

783
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:21,346
Because there was a new disciplinary master,
Yuen Si-yum

784
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,283
She set all the rules

785
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,214
She used to summon the
students to the school office

786
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,089
Nobody knows what punishment they'll face

787
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:38,223
My Uncle never interfered

788
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,298
You seduced my husband, bitch!

789
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:16,735
I'll burn you alive...

790
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,416
Let me out! Help!

791
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,352
What are you doing, Ping?

792
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:39,860
Open the door!

793
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:44,023
You broke the school rules, too!

794
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:49,132
You're screwing around within the school

795
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:03,983
They'd never found her body

796
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:07,889
No one knew if she was dead or alive

797
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:13,091
When the school re-opened,
weird things began to happen

798
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:22,467
I discovered the inexistent school office

799
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:37,043
I was secretly admiring a boy

800
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,387
but he liked another girl

801
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:45,950
That girl died one night

802
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:52,194
It was then when I found out

803
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,428
whoever broke the rules would
be summoned to the office

804
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:59,204
According to a website created by a former student

805
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,139
The only way to stop the curse

806
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,235
is to find the right location of the office

807
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,177
and burn it down

808
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:07,476
Was that you?

809
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,241
A priest taught me that

810
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:13,344
But after the renovation

811
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:17,290
Nobody knew where the original office was

812
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,122
Anyway

813
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,458
The school board has decided
to close down the school

814
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,824
That should be the end

815
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,131
Goodbye, Miss Fong

816
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,861
I hate that disciplinary master

817
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:55,553
Me too!

818
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:12,513
You're lucky you don't remember anything

819
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:20,519
I'll never forget that day

820
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,357
I really want to burn her again

821
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,988
That's the only way to save the students

822
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,403
Time for your medication!

823
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:47,073
Sit down! I'll take you for a walk later

824
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,324
Dick, Si, Cat, Charlie

825
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,490
Watch over us

826
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,896
We'll avenge your death!

827
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:54,606
Ho Yat-man, Ko Hon-keung, Lau Cheuk-bun

828
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,082
Plan A

829
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:59,484
Law Siu-fong, report to the school office

830
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,252
I have more if you need it

831
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,226
It's the holy water from the Cathedral

832
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,424
We'll finish her off!

833
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:12,456
Remember this

834
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,594
Mind your safety

835
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:16,295
Before we burn that school office

836
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:17,702
Don't open any door

837
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:20,533
Any door may lead to the office!

838
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,271
Ho Yat-man, Ko Hon-keung, Lau Cheuk-bun

839
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,349
We're here. Come and get us

840
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,713
We're already over broke the
rules by dress up like this,

841
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,077
Come and get us!

842
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:09,989
Behind you, Fong-fong!

843
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:14,755
Don't let go!

844
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,700
Help me!

845
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,264
Fong-fong! Let her out, bitch!

846
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,568
Calm down, Ben!

847
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:28,667
Go to plan B

848
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:42,247
What do you want? Stay away...

849
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:52,790
Remember how I used to pull your braids?

850
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,332
That's because I want to stay close to you

851
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:56,426
Ben!

852
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,598
Do you know when I was young

853
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,368
I didn't dare to tell my mom though I had a fever

854
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:03,673
I worried I couldn't see you
if I missed the school

855
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,580
When I met you again over here

856
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,708
I was so excited

857
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:11,618
I want to tell you

858
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,451
I'm really in love with you! It's true!

859
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,558
Follow me to the school office now!

860
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:20,389
I'm counting on you, Keung!

861
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,591
Fong-fong!

862
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:24,462
Yat-man!

863
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,161
Hurry up, Ko Hon-keung!

864
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:27,530
Run along!

865
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:32,362
Where's the lighter?

866
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,070
Look for it! Hurry up! She's catching up with Ben!

867
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,143
Shit! I can't open all the doors!

868
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,495
Did Keung get her?

869
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:28,688
The lighter!

870
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:50,843
Are you alright, Ben?

871
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:52,580
We burned the office!

872
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,185
I'm in the Biology lab

873
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,224
I'm coming to you

874
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,459
Sorry! Wrong one!

875
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:07,397
She's still here!

876
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,435
How did that happen?

877
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:20,940
Ben's walkie talkie!

878
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,410
What now?

879
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,315
Miss Fong said if we burn the office

880
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,353
We'll finish her off!

881
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:27,945
What now, Yat-man?

882
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:32,557
I don't know! Maybe that wasn't it!

883
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:36,893
Where's the real school office?

884
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:38,728
Fong-fong! Plan B!

885
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:43,767
Ben, I knew it

886
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:47,603
You were in love with me since grade school

887
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,701
I made sure Mom gave me braids

888
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,439
so you could pull them

889
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,881
Then I'd have an excuse to talk to you

890
01:15:56,919 --> 01:16:00,446
When I found out you're coming

891
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,751
I was really happy

892
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:09,723
See? She's crazy about me!

893
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,468
Fong-fong, say it again!

894
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:30,514
It won't work! She'll know I'm lying

895
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:33,554
I hated him for pulling my braids

896
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:37,022
I was never in love with him!

897
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,763
I was never in love with him!

898
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:55,635
Yuen Si-yum, come out!

899
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:59,840
Calm down, Ko Hon-keung

900
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:03,476
I was sent to a boys' home in Form 1

901
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:05,710
Everyone thinks I'm with the triad

902
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,584
Pick on a rotten student like me. Why Ben?

903
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,425
Let him go!

904
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:19,491
Calm down...

905
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:39,682
I don't want anyone to get hurt, especially you

906
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:44,482
We'll be fine

907
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:52,726
Are you alright?

908
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:57,368
Yat-man!

909
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:01,802
Yat-man!

910
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:11,114
Calm down...

911
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,751
Follow me

912
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:17,485
Stay where you are! I'll go back for Yat-man

913
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:18,820
Ko Hon-keung

914
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:31,938
Yuen Si-yum, let her go!

915
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,406
She's always abided by the rules

916
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:35,102
She didn't do anything wrong

917
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:37,134
Why her?

918
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,945
I broke the rules

919
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,986
I fall in love with her

920
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:58,829
I'm saying this again,
I fall in love with Ho Yat-man

921
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:00,799
I have broken the cardinal rule

922
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,166
Come after me!

923
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:28,919
Don't believe him! He's lying

924
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:32,591
That was me falling in love with him! Was me!

925
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:35,727
Leave him alone! Punish me!

926
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:53,046
Run! Ko Hon-keung, run!

927
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,753
Yat-man!

928
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:57,586
Please run!

929
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:00,962
Come out! Yat-man

930
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,564
I won't love you

931
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,461
Yat-man!

932
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:07,899
No need to worry about me

933
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:33,091
Yat-man!

934
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:42,900
Miss Fong, Yuen Si-yum got Ben

935
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:46,667
Only Ko Hon-keung is left to save Yat-man

936
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:49,505
Why did you come back?

937
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:04,622
Auntie, we're here

938
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:08,224
Do what you have to do

939
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:31,103
They took down one floor during renovation

940
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:40,843
Miss Fong!

941
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:41,981
Where is Yat-man?

942
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,387
Inside the school office

943
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:26,132
I won't let you harm my students

944
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:34,069
Yat-man... wake up

945
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:14,905
Yuen Si-yum, I hate you!

946
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,823
Don't mind us, run!

947
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:44,844
Are you alright?

948
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:46,038
Watch out!

949
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:48,404
Cat, Charlie

950
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,384
Keung, Yat-man, run!

951
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:16,238
Come one, Fong-fong is waiting outside

952
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:33,019
Is it true, what you said?

953
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,561
What?

954
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:42,101
You said you fall in love with me

955
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:45,229
It's true! What about you?

956
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,570
Are you telling the truth?

957
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:02,956
Yat-man!

958
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,129
You break the Rule No. 1

959
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:18,905
Falling in Love is not allowed
