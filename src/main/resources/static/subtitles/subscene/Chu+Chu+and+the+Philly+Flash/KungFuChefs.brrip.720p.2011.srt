1
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,680
Uncle Yi, I want an ultraman.

2
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,048
But I want the lemon flavor.

3
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:19,777
Sure.

4
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,851
That's all right.

5
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:42,840
Keung, where are you?

6
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:44,968
Thank you, Uncle Yi.

7
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:59,284
It's over done!

8
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:18,465
Leung.

9
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:23,914
Chief, what's the matter?

10
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:26,683
See? The pork is over done.
I told you many times.

11
00:01:26,684 --> 00:01:29,453
Pork is the star of this dish.

12
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:33,223
I... I just went to toilet
for a while, so...

13
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:34,892
It's ridiculous!

14
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:39,159
You're not in the mood all the day,
see? You caused trouble at last.

15
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,432
What's the matter with you?

16
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:45,736
There is only half hour
to the banquet.

17
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:48,338
Now, the pork is over done.

18
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:51,708
Can we serve without pork
in the pot?

19
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,541
What we can do now
is to use the ''Blade''.

20
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,317
Leung, borrow the Blade.

21
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,232
The 5th descendant of the
Dragon Head Blade, Wong Bing-Yi,

22
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:16,867
I'd like to borrow the Blade now.

23
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:20,360
With the unification of the blade,
we'll do it righteous and filial.

24
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,952
Ah Yi borrows the Blade.

25
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:35,919
What is it about?

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,888
The Chief is holding the
Dragon Head's Blade.

27
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,891
What is it for?

28
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:44,190
Why did he take out the Blade?

29
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,500
This is my first time to view it.

30
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:53,868
Wah, this is my first time
to view this Blade.

31
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:58,266
Don't block my way;
I want to see how wonderful it is.

32
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,433
Bravo!

33
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:26,036
Woo, it's really wonderful!

34
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:27,771
Second-Uncle,
you can tell the guests that...

35
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,373
The banquet will be on time.

36
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:32,209
So, I'll count on you
to make us some tasty pork.

37
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,010
Sure, no problem.

38
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,912
This is a red pocket for you,
for working smooth.

39
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:36,780
Thank you, Uncle.

40
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,615
Okay, the banquet
will be started on time.

41
00:03:38,616 --> 00:03:40,417
Come on, help me to serve.

42
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:45,188
Little sis, 5th-Uncle...

43
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:48,058
We wish you happy birthday!
Thank you.

44
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:49,760
We wish you happy birthday!

45
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:50,560
Good! Thank you for coming.

46
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,395
Thank you, Uncle.

47
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:52,596
Come on, cheers...

48
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,831
Cheers!

49
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:57,300
What a smell!

50
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:02,932
It smells so good!

51
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:05,008
Give me the salt.

52
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:07,067
Here it is.

53
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:21,081
It's done!

54
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:26,696
Eat more! Come on, enjoy your food.

55
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:28,865
Come on,

56
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:31,061
come...

57
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:33,603
Take it to that table,
and that table, too.

58
00:04:33,604 --> 00:04:35,772
Eat more! Come on...

59
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:36,973
Eat more.

60
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:38,736
Cheers!

61
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:44,414
If Master Joe was here,
we wouldn't have been that messy.

62
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,918
Even he is willing to help,
I won't let him do it.

63
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,488
I promised my brother
to let his son achieve great success.

64
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:54,287
But he is still a cook out there.

65
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:56,259
Tidy up now.

66
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,388
Chief, oh no! What a trouble!

67
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,093
Why did you do that?

68
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:47,711
Don't let him go!

69
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:49,913
He is the cook!
He intended to poison us!

70
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,014
He should not be the Chief
of our village.

71
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:53,380
Dare you want to go?

72
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:50,631
Who asked you to do so?

73
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:54,067
It's Master Joe.

74
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:07,023
Wong Bing-Yi,
since you borrowed the Blade,

75
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:08,892
You must be responsible.

76
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:12,487
Wong, you are not qualified
to be a cook.

77
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,001
I was being set up!

78
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,135
Did I misunderstand you?

79
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,538
You cooked the pork.

80
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,008
Yi, you don't deserve
to have the Blade.

81
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,476
Master Joe is the man behind...

82
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:29,613
I decided to expel Wong Bing-Yi.

83
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:33,447
Wong Kai-Joe will substitute him
for a while.

84
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:15,718
KUNG FU CHEFS

85
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:21,096
Tai-tung Martial Arts

86
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:54,464
Students, before your graduation,

87
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:58,168
Let's see who can put the emblem
of the school...

88
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:00,570
Back to its original place.

89
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,839
The one who can do it will be...

90
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,137
The first honored graduate
of the school.

91
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,136
On your mark...

92
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:13,749
Get set...

93
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,682
Go!

94
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,977
It is with him!

95
00:10:13,978 --> 00:10:16,139
Go after him!

96
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:24,085
Don't let him go!

97
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,790
Give it to me.

98
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,525
Are you kidding me?

99
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,857
It is with the principal.

100
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:34,164
Don't come to me...

101
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:36,366
Respect your principal!

102
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:37,834
Who wants to be
the first honored graduate?

103
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:40,098
Move!

104
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:42,038
Are you serious?

105
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:45,667
I wanna be!
Me too...

106
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:58,121
I don't have it,

107
00:10:58,122 --> 00:10:59,889
it's not with me...

108
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,891
I passed it to Ken'ichi.

109
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:04,383
It is with Ken'ichi.

110
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:06,830
Where is it? Where is it?

111
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:07,864
Principal, who did you give it to?

112
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,033
I... I gave it to that jerk!

113
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:12,068
Where is he now?

114
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,696
You bastard!

115
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:23,738
Pal, thank you.

116
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,865
Has Ken'ichi left?

117
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,366
I am asking you.

118
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,870
Has Ken'ichi left?

119
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,472
I think he has just left,
maybe, perhaps,

120
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,531
I think so...

121
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,776
It's nonsense to ask you.

122
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:55,812
I'll go after him.

123
00:11:55,813 --> 00:11:57,380
You don't need to.

124
00:11:57,381 --> 00:12:00,941
He asked me to give you this box
before he left.

125
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:21,999
How dare he fool the principal!

126
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:45,891
Watch out, it's breaking!

127
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:54,060
It's school property.

128
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:21,664
Principal, I have to leave now.

129
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:24,300
Politeness, justice, honesty and
honor, patience and self control.

130
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:26,135
I will never forget
what you have taught me.

131
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:27,770
I made you these noodles.

132
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:31,832
This is just a token from me.

133
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:37,547
It's very kind of you.

134
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:39,777
Rise.

135
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:42,719
After leaving the school,

136
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,955
go to this place to look for
master Sum Wai-tak.

137
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,523
What for?

138
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:51,461
From this great master,
you can learn what you're lacking for.

139
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,631
The principles of gourmandism are:
color, smell, taste, conception and appearance.

140
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,899
Ken has cooking talent.

141
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,701
But he doesn't know much
about the idea of food.

142
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,770
However, we cannot teach
the conception of food.

143
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:03,773
He must figure it out in his life.

144
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:06,676
If he can match himself with food,
then, he can make it.

145
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,512
Although Ken isn't a local student,

146
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:13,082
He has strong passion
on Chinese cookery.

147
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,418
After some time, I am sure...

148
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,580
He can become a great cook.

149
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:55,787
Sis, do you think the smell of tea
can distract me?

150
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,194
Please wait!

151
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,835
Forget it, Ching,

152
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:09,066
I am sure you can't get it
just by smelling.

153
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:11,908
We should get ready
for servicing now.

154
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:13,967
Come on, just say you can't make it.

155
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,747
Kam-lui, I told you, remember?

156
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:20,917
I want to serve our guests
nutritious soup,

157
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,919
But not this kind of mixture.

158
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,910
You can smell it, can't you?

159
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:31,127
This seems to be a nutritious soup,

160
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:33,529
But actually,
it is medicine instead of soup.

161
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,398
Take it away.

162
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,500
I tried so much time
and effort for it.

163
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:40,403
What a pity
that you still miss something.

164
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:41,738
I have already helped you.

165
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:43,934
But my sister is really great!

166
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,511
Kam-lui, what is this black stuff?

167
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:51,280
It's disgusting!
Take it away please.

168
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,339
Take it away!

169
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,485
My sister is really great!

170
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,497
Have the goods
we ordered been delivered?

171
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,693
I am now going to check it.

172
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:29,986
What's wrong with you?

173
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:30,853
Come and give me a hand.

174
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:32,446
All right.

175
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,258
Let me help you.

176
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:36,159
Thank you.

177
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,684
You're welcome.

178
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:42,331
Are you kidding?

179
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,800
You messed up everything!

180
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:44,367
I am sorry...

181
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:48,326
If any of it breaks,
I'll cut the bill, you got it?

182
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:54,340
Come on.

183
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:58,181
Oh my head...

184
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,715
It hurts!

185
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:02,018
What are you looking at?

186
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,181
Move those stuffs inside, hurry up!

187
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:06,689
No, I...

188
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,425
I'll check the bill later,
but I must check the goods first

189
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,661
If any breaks, I won't pay the bill.

190
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,930
If one is rotten,
I'll deduct 2 dollars, and so on

191
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,198
Move now!

192
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,564
Hurry up!

193
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:22,136
You too, move those
near the door way first.

194
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,705
Excuse me, sir...

195
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:59,709
Do you want to eat in?

196
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,837
This way please.

197
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:05,314
What did you say?

198
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:07,116
I said...

199
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,451
First, I am not a coolie.

200
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:11,053
Second, I didn't mean to hurt you.

201
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:14,023
Third, I came here for Master Sum.

202
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,991
The forth thing is...

203
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:18,794
I am really hungry.

204
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:21,731
Why didn't you voice out?

205
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:25,167
Did you give me a chance?

206
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:29,138
I'll make you pay for
hurting my head later.

207
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:29,972
Please wait for me
right here for a minute.

208
00:18:29,973 --> 00:18:31,073
Since our shop
has just been in service,

209
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:33,276
If you don't mind,
please sit inside.

210
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:35,039
It's all right.

211
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:49,892
You want to see Master Sum?

212
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:53,362
So, you must tell me
what ingredients are put inside the soup.

213
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,464
Sis.

214
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,216
Thank you.

215
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:20,851
The water from 3 rivers.

216
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:24,427
So, you are a gourmet!

217
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,418
I just know something about food.

218
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:34,036
Did you make this Pu-er tea
with old tangerine peel?

219
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:36,605
How did you know it?

220
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:39,608
Old orange peel is as precious
as old ginseng.

221
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:43,079
To mix tangerine peel
with old Pu-er tea,

222
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,346
It is the best drink to quench thirst
and helps good digestion.

223
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:50,086
You know much about tea.

224
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:53,456
However, our food is even better
than this tea.

225
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:56,592
I am sure you have never
tried that before.

226
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:58,694
What do you want to order, sir?

227
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:01,030
What is the signature dish
of your restaurant?

228
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:03,833
All are signature dishes,
you can order anything you'd like to eat.

229
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,835
''Cabbage in clear water'' please.

230
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:08,537
''Cabbage in Clear Water''?

231
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:11,807
So, is it steamed or boiled?

232
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:14,710
Mind your tongue!
That is the famous Szechwan dish.

233
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,112
Although this is a
Cantonese restaurant,

234
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:20,447
Since you order it,
we'll get it ready for you.

235
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,988
Have you figured it out?

236
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:30,826
Are you kidding me?
This tastes like medicine.

237
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:34,630
But I know there is
something special inside.

238
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:37,133
This is a soup with 3 snakes
and a turtle. So disgusting!

239
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:39,568
I can't imagine that
you're really great!

240
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:44,472
So, do you know how to make
''Cabbage in clear water''?

241
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:46,308
I am a cook,

242
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:50,279
Sure I know how to make
such simple dish.

243
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,509
One for me please.

244
00:20:54,951 --> 00:20:58,421
Master, why does he order
Szechwan food in a Cantonese restaurant?

245
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:00,122
It's weird.

246
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:02,124
I think this is a cook too.

247
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,528
He wants to try me
with that special dish.

248
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:08,862
Luckily I am not nobody.

249
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,882
Bro, there is just cabbage and soup,

250
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,751
Why people view this
as the greatest dish of all?

251
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:33,222
Yi, for we villagers,
cabbage has special meaning.

252
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:35,191
It is like our family.

253
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:37,259
Normally, we won't pay
special attention to it,

254
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,829
However, when we lose it,
we will miss it.

255
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,699
You'll understand the warmth
and love of it

256
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,667
Check please.

257
00:21:54,411 --> 00:21:58,614
Sir, is there any problem
with our cabbage?

258
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:00,316
Be frank...

259
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:02,512
This is far beyond standard.

260
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:05,688
I don't understand what you mean...

261
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:08,023
The cabbage and chicken are not bad.

262
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:10,759
But the process is wrong.

263
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,095
The cabbage you made here...

264
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:16,198
Any cook can make it.

265
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:19,259
The original one
has not been found for ages.

266
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:23,029
May I know your name?

267
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:24,907
Wong Bing-Yi.

268
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,709
Master Wong,
if you are a great cook,

269
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,077
Dare you compete with me?

270
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:29,478
What if we lose,

271
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,914
I will
leave this restaurant forever.

272
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:32,748
If you lose,

273
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:35,751
please wash dishes here for a year.

274
00:22:35,752 --> 00:22:37,753
Why should I compete with you?

275
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:40,890
As a cook,
you have no reason to reject me.

276
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:44,326
Okay, but I need an assistant.

277
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:17,259
I can tell it's done by Master Sum
at the first bite.

278
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,561
It's really tasty!

279
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:22,164
So soft and spicy,
and it's not greasy at all.

280
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:25,701
This has been the signature dish
of our restaurant.

281
00:23:25,702 --> 00:23:27,770
And, he has a good assistant.

282
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:30,873
So, to him,
this is just a piece of cake.

283
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:32,107
Master Wong.

284
00:23:32,108 --> 00:23:34,977
What do you think about his dish?

285
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,378
It's just fair.

286
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:47,356
Master Wong, it has been put here
for quite a long time, it's cold.

287
00:23:47,357 --> 00:23:48,824
Watch out!

288
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:49,992
Sis.

289
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:53,053
Oh no! Why is it so hot?

290
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:07,373
What's wrong with it?

291
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:11,547
Actually, wrapping the skin...

292
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:13,749
It is a thin layer of sugar.

293
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,618
It is for keeping the duck warm.

294
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:17,152
Although the duck
is put on the table,

295
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:20,087
Actually, it's still
in the process of cooking.

296
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:29,255
It is very...

297
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,190
What is it?

298
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,942
I lost.

299
00:24:49,219 --> 00:24:51,520
Why?

300
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:56,358
It is ''Wu-jo's 8 Treasure duck'',
not any cook has ever made it for century.

301
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,127
I can't imagine that...

302
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:01,825
It tastes like what it is written
in the cook book.

303
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:05,556
To make this dish,
we can't use knife.

304
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:09,028
Not any knife should be used.

305
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:20,215
Duck's meat is hard to handle,
once it is in touch with knife,

306
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:25,847
The tissue will go hard and still,
and the fibres will break.

307
00:25:27,357 --> 00:25:28,223
Master!

308
00:25:28,224 --> 00:25:28,991
Don't stop him.

309
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:31,660
I know very well about Master Sum.

310
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:35,331
After leaving school, go to
this place for Master Sum Wai-tak.

311
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:38,033
By the way, he always wants to leave.
Master Sum Wai-tak, please wait.

312
00:25:38,034 --> 00:25:40,102
What did you say?

313
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,093
Sum Wai-tak?

314
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:45,074
Right, Sum Wai-tak is my father.

315
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:46,208
However...

316
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:47,810
He passed away last year.

317
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:52,839
Sum Wai-tak
was my brother's master, too.

318
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:55,451
I know.

319
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:57,753
When I tasted the duck,

320
00:25:57,754 --> 00:26:00,051
I knew who you are.

321
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:03,923
So, about my story...

322
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:09,832
Master Wong, I heard something
about you before.

323
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,867
I believe that you're innocent.

324
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:14,870
Why?

325
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:17,072
It's basic instinct.

326
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:21,942
A cook who loves cooking
will never do that.

327
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:30,252
Have some tea please.

328
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,345
Thank you.

329
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:36,425
Master Sum left.

330
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:39,952
We have no cook now.

331
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:43,499
I just know following cook book.

332
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,202
And my sister doesn't want to
be a cook, too.

333
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:50,906
If this goes on, our restaurant...

334
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:53,575
It will be closed sooner or later.

335
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:56,211
And this family business will...

336
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:59,214
My brother adopted
your father's cooking skills

337
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:02,050
And I adopted cooking skills
from my brother.

338
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:05,788
So, I am obliged to help maintain
the fame of ''Sum's restaurant''.

339
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:08,557
But I just can't do it alone.

340
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:11,093
Master Wong, do you want...

341
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:14,363
The young man I just saw is smart.

342
00:27:14,364 --> 00:27:16,331
He is just a little bit arrogant.

343
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:18,033
If he is well trained,

344
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:20,736
sure he will become great.

345
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:22,871
But he may not stay.

346
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:24,673
I believe that he will.

347
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:27,209
But under one condition.

348
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,777
Please go ahead.

349
00:27:28,778 --> 00:27:31,480
Never call me Master Wong again.

350
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:34,283
Call me Ah Yi.

351
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:37,719
All right, Ah Yi.

352
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:52,601
I want to challenge you!

353
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:54,236
What do you want to compete with me?

354
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:56,170
Cutting skills.

355
00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:04,580
I am sorry...

356
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:08,175
It's up to you.

357
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:12,988
He knows how to cut a globe fish!

358
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:15,616
No matter why he wants to
compete with cutting skills.

359
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:18,927
To cut a globe fish,
the cook must be quick and sharp.

360
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:22,130
There are many thorny things
on the skin of the fish.

361
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:24,199
You can cut it with the knife.

362
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,201
But it's really difficult.

363
00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:30,570
That's why it can test
the cutting skill of a cook.

364
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:33,909
Finished.

365
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,112
This is the sliced globe fish.

366
00:28:37,113 --> 00:28:39,147
If you have worries, so...

367
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:43,379
you can eat it half hour later.

368
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:48,390
I can't smell the stink of fish
but tastes it so sweet and fine.

369
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,125
It's neither like fish nor meat

370
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:52,651
This is the top level
of eating globe fish!

371
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:56,521
It's okay, it's my turn now

372
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:02,538
It is a bream.
The Japanese take bream as the king of fish.

373
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,106
Its taste is elegant and subtle.

374
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:06,768
But comparing with globe fish...

375
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:12,047
This is cold slice of bream.

376
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:13,649
It doesn't seem to be special.

377
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,517
No matter how skillful is Yi,

378
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:19,385
how can the taste of bream
be better than globe fish?

379
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,285
You...

380
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,733
What knife did you use?

381
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:34,336
The knife was cold.

382
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:35,938
The meaning of ''Sushi'',

383
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:39,308
that is to keep the fish
at a cool stage.

384
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,039
So, the fish will be tasty

385
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:45,847
After the sudden cold feeling,

386
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:48,617
the temperature inside the mouth
mixes with the tasty fish,

387
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:52,815
it is stirred inside the mouth
and spread outwards.

388
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:00,896
The frozen bream
seems to have rebirth!

389
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:04,195
This is the best taste of all.

390
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,771
I am not the loser.

391
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:12,263
I failed to have a better knife.

392
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:27,548
You're really great.

393
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,293
Actually, this is the secret
of cutting skills.

394
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:40,168
Who messed up with my sauce?

395
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:43,638
Why are all the carrots gone?

396
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:47,109
The money for paying the vegetables...

397
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,976
I have to pay the supplier now...

398
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:54,145
The money for paying the vegetables...

399
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:57,119
All right, don't cry please.

400
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,417
I have got it ready.

401
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:01,790
Come on, you cry whenever you get
the money for paying vegetables!

402
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,816
8,000...

403
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:14,827
Your order please.

404
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:17,472
Who told you to delivery
these things to us?

405
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:20,168
This is the order of Mr. Wong.

406
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:22,678
Thank you.

407
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:23,845
What is it?

408
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:24,846
Whose stuff is it?

409
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:27,315
To make tangerine sauce,
using pineapple juice is okay.

410
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:29,451
But you must add chrysanthemum
and iquorice.

411
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:31,887
With a green root and tastes ho

412
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:33,522
you can't say it a radish.

413
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:34,890
From Wong Bing-Yi.

414
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:36,191
He must have done something
to my sauce.

415
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,159
He has gone too far!

416
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:49,771
Master...

417
00:31:49,772 --> 00:31:52,474
Don't greet me master,
I haven't promised to be your master yet.

418
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:54,376
Master, come on!

419
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:57,744
I'll do anything you tell me.

420
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:18,667
When heaven wants someone
to do something big,

421
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:21,002
first,
the guy will be bitterly trained.

422
00:32:21,003 --> 00:32:23,505
He will be hungry and tired,

423
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:26,575
he will be trained
to be calm and mild.

424
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:29,544
So he will gain strength
from his training.

425
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,394
Are you sick?
How can this sharpening these knives...

426
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:49,731
You didn't sleep but sharpen
the knife in the middle of the night.

427
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:51,366
And you made it till dawn!

428
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:53,068
Will you let others sleep?

429
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:55,637
I can't imagine that,
you're not only selfish,

430
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:58,473
but also deaf!

431
00:32:58,474 --> 00:33:00,008
You're sick!

432
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:02,568
What do you want?

433
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:05,313
Do you think
you're acting horror film?

434
00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:08,116
Who do you want to scare
with these knives?

435
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:09,818
You know? You made sounds all night,

436
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:12,454
I just couldn't sleep all night.

437
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:14,422
Are you crazy?

438
00:33:14,423 --> 00:33:17,125
Are you sick?

439
00:33:17,126 --> 00:33:20,026
Why don't you go for medication?

440
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:32,730
Master.

441
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:39,344
I've already done
with the rusted knives.

442
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:43,819
So, we...

443
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,787
When can we start?

444
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:47,789
Start what?

445
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,159
Of course, you teach me cooking.

446
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,719
What else do you think?

447
00:33:54,096 --> 00:33:57,997
Since this is sharpened by you,
you'll use it.

448
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:01,937
What?

449
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:03,705
Didn't you hear it clear?

450
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:06,436
I... I want to know...

451
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:09,737
When will you teach me cooking?

452
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:11,413
So boring!

453
00:34:11,414 --> 00:34:14,075
Peel it, there are some baskets
waiting for you

454
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,682
Master, I...

455
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:31,665
Ah Yi.

456
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:38,907
Tomorrow is the first day
you become the chef,

457
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:41,910
this is your uniform.

458
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:44,038
Thank you.

459
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:48,844
Yi, what is bothering you?

460
00:34:50,353 --> 00:34:53,822
I am worrying about my nephew.

461
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:01,162
Silky cake.

462
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:02,530
Greatest of all.

463
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:04,432
Crab meat in bird's nest soup.

464
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:06,368
Deep boiled snakes in oil
with ginger and green onion.

465
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:08,603
Cod fish's face in herbal sauce.

466
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:10,038
BBQ conch.

467
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,706
Abalones in winter melon.

468
00:35:11,707 --> 00:35:13,108
BBQ goose.

469
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:14,075
Greatest mouths of all.

470
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:16,077
Curry seafood.

471
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:17,545
Roasted pigeon in lavender sauce.

472
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:19,214
Fried shark-fins.

473
00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:20,515
Seafood in pumpkin.

474
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:22,984
World's selection of Sushi.

475
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:25,180
Treasure of the world...

476
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,890
Master Joe.

477
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:34,328
This is the newly designed menu
for the new shop, are you satisfied with it?

478
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:37,527
Just follow your idea. Dismiss.

479
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,406
Master, this is the new chef
I hired for the new branch.

480
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:46,272
Master Sum.

481
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:51,012
Where did you work before?

482
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:53,003
Sum's Restaurant.

483
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:58,019
So, why do you want to work in the
King of Cantonese Restaurant?

484
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,623
Master Joe, actually, I always wish...

485
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:04,684
to work in such a big group.

486
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:08,224
I want the truth.

487
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:12,267
The reason is...

488
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:15,804
I... I made a small mistake
in a cooking race.

489
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:19,331
I was defeated by 2 persons, so...

490
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,078
Master Sum is quite famous
in this field.

491
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,605
What is that guy?
What cook can defeat you?

492
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,083
That guy is named...

493
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:30,643
Wong Bing-Yi.

494
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:34,656
Pardon?

495
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:36,818
He is named Wong Bing-Yi.

496
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,229
Wong Bing-Yi.

497
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:45,400
I won't be merciful this time.

498
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:50,804
Master Joe, but the Chief has left
the village for ages.

499
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,177
Are you on his side?

500
00:36:56,178 --> 00:36:57,479
I am not!

501
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,346
What I mean is...

502
00:36:58,347 --> 00:37:00,382
I mean, you are his nephew...

503
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:01,750
Actually, it's nonsense.,,

504
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:02,684
Why do you treat him as your foe?

505
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,052
Right? Listen to me...

506
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:06,851
Shut up!

507
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:10,291
He stole the Dragon Head Blade,
he hurt my father.

508
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:13,386
At that time, did he remember
that's his brother?

509
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:27,072
Give it back to me!

510
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:30,269
Give it back to me!

511
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:33,914
Give it back to me!

512
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,553
Give it back to me!

513
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:44,292
Give it back to me!

514
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:46,127
Give it back to me!

515
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:49,119
Brother, stay calm please.

516
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:50,598
Why?

517
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:52,567
That blade is mine!

518
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:55,403
I am the Best Chef of the World!

519
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:58,668
You have no right to hide the blade.

520
00:38:04,613 --> 00:38:07,148
I don't need this.

521
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:10,550
I want the Dragon Head Blade!

522
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:15,490
Where is mine?

523
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:17,325
Where is my Dragon Head Blade?

524
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:20,659
Give it back to me!

525
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:40,470
He always wants that blade and
to be the Chief of the Village.

526
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:02,570
Wake up please!

527
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:05,562
Bro, drink no more!

528
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:23,422
At the most critical moment...

529
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,557
Ah Yi!

530
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:31,163
Brother!

531
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:34,335
I witnessed it.

532
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:37,172
It's him...

533
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:39,307
He set a trap for my dad.

534
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:42,140
My brother got hurt
because of saving me.

535
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:44,312
It hurts!

536
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:47,182
My father can no longer be a cook,
all because of him.

537
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:49,378
He left the village.

538
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,152
Bro!

539
00:39:51,153 --> 00:39:53,888
Stop it, I have no face
to stay any longer.

540
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:56,949
Please take care of Joe for me.

541
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,568
I promised my brother to
take good care of Joe, God knows that...

542
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:08,970
He forced by me
to leave the village.

543
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,530
It's a revenge.

544
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:15,533
How can he do this to you?

545
00:40:16,178 --> 00:40:18,246
Forget it.

546
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:21,614
Let bygones be bygones.

547
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:23,952
In fact, your brother...

548
00:40:23,953 --> 00:40:28,323
Won the championship of the
World's Best Chef for 2 consecutive years.

549
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:31,759
He gained much fame for us.

550
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,956
My brother is really a genius.

551
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:41,734
Wrong.

552
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:55,306
Wrong!

553
00:40:57,353 --> 00:41:02,449
Wrong!

554
00:41:35,024 --> 00:41:40,128
Cutting skills is easy to learn
but it needs non stop practice.

555
00:41:40,129 --> 00:41:44,632
For common people,
they just need to cut sharp.

556
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:46,701
If a cook has better skills,

557
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:50,438
He can handle chopping, hitting,
mashing and slashing well.

558
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:53,207
That's already good skills.

559
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,777
But if he wants to be a good cook,

560
00:41:55,778 --> 00:42:00,415
Different ingredients need
different kinds of cutting skills.

561
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:04,249
So, it'll take much time
for real practice.

562
00:42:19,768 --> 00:42:21,035
Is it really that bad?

563
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:23,371
I did it purposely for you.

564
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:25,306
Thank you.

565
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:28,332
I worked for one whole day.

566
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:31,577
I already said thank you.

567
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:35,039
Don't be cocky!

568
00:44:15,684 --> 00:44:18,820
Other than being fresh,
to make great food,

569
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:21,923
We need great sauce to mix with it.

570
00:44:21,924 --> 00:44:24,292
Saucing is the soul of a dish.

571
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:26,060
But different people
have different taste.

572
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:28,930
But you will get bored for eating
same good food everyday.

573
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:31,799
So,
all good cook can make good sauce.

574
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,767
Try it.

575
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:49,917
Ying, why the sauce you made...

576
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:53,182
are of the same taste?

577
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:55,923
I think so.

578
00:44:55,924 --> 00:44:57,948
Kam-lui.

579
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:07,935
Actually it's easy to make sauce.

580
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:10,605
You just need a little patience.

581
00:45:10,606 --> 00:45:12,773
And some interest.

582
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:16,072
And some imagination.

583
00:45:16,812 --> 00:45:18,412
There are few kinds of taste,

584
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:22,750
sweet, sour, bitter, hot and salty.

585
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:25,119
Just keep on trying.

586
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,990
Mix with different ingredients.

587
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:33,552
Then find out the best choice
of the guests, that's all

588
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:39,962
Is it tasty, Kam-lui?

589
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:42,436
It is sweet and salty.

590
00:45:42,437 --> 00:45:45,606
But I can taste sweet and hot
at the same time, it's great!

591
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:48,166
How did you make it?

592
00:45:49,778 --> 00:45:52,813
I haven't tried
such special sauce before.

593
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:54,849
Kam-lui, let's use this sauce today.

594
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:56,250
Keep it well in the kitchen.

595
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:57,885
Be careful.

596
00:45:57,886 --> 00:46:00,411
Kam-lui, I'll go with you.

597
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:07,819
Ying, what are you thinking?

598
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:14,101
I am thinking of a way to
make some delicious bean cube pudding.

599
00:46:14,102 --> 00:46:15,836
You want to make bean cube pudding?

600
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:18,105
Greet me Master,
then I'll teach you.

601
00:46:18,106 --> 00:46:20,675
But I want the most delicious one.

602
00:46:20,676 --> 00:46:21,475
No problem.

603
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:24,274
Master!

604
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,050
The ingredients for making
bean cube pudding is simple.

605
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:32,920
Soy beans, water and some substance
for solidification.

606
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:37,687
The proportion of soy beans
and water may differ.

607
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:43,896
Today, I'll teach you frying.

608
00:46:52,808 --> 00:46:55,810
For fried eggs, we love it to be
smooth, soft and with good smell.

609
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:56,978
But how to make it smooth?

610
00:46:56,979 --> 00:46:59,146
The key point is to let air
enter the eggs.

611
00:46:59,147 --> 00:47:00,915
Bubble it.

612
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,050
This shares the same theory
of making spongy cakes.

613
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:05,386
I'll show you.

614
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:08,048
Then, you'll count on yourself.

615
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:20,968
The key point is to control
the temperature of the oil.

616
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:23,137
Just one word, don't use boiled oil.

617
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:24,605
If so, the eggs will be over done.

618
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:26,232
Come on.

619
00:47:47,262 --> 00:47:50,464
Master, it is not done yet.

620
00:47:50,465 --> 00:47:53,434
Yes, it is to use the remained heat
to make it all done.

621
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:54,969
So, the eggs will be smooth.

622
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:59,407
Other than skills of frying,

623
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:00,975
You need to pay attention
to breaking the eggs.

624
00:48:00,976 --> 00:48:03,411
And, most important of all is
to control the heat.

625
00:48:03,412 --> 00:48:06,347
It is simple to talk,
but it is really difficult.

626
00:48:06,348 --> 00:48:09,917
This is named
''Wong Po thousand layers of egg''

627
00:48:09,918 --> 00:48:13,120
Fried egg is just a simple dish.

628
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:15,384
But it is really
something interesting!

629
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:25,396
More simple the dish is,
more difficulty to be handled.

630
00:48:29,037 --> 00:48:32,870
It's really hard to cook great dish.

631
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:36,610
No. it is not hard to cook well

632
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:39,011
It's really hard
to perform well in life.

633
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,352
Move now.

634
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,800
This is the home made sauce.

635
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,102
It's tasty!

636
00:49:01,103 --> 00:49:02,837
This is newly made,
hope you all like it.

637
00:49:02,838 --> 00:49:04,305
Boss. I haven't eaten
so delicious chicken.

638
00:49:04,306 --> 00:49:06,273
What is it about?

639
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:11,979
What is it?

640
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,107
What is it?

641
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:19,520
This is...

642
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:21,889
Obviously, it is a nail.

643
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:22,990
Nail?

644
00:49:22,991 --> 00:49:25,526
Can you get it? It is a nail.

645
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,762
What is it? What nail
you're talking about?

646
00:49:27,763 --> 00:49:31,265
There are some nails in the pot,
it can kill.

647
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:32,767
Oh no!

648
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:34,268
Don't get nervous,
it's just a misunderstanding.

649
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:36,103
Kam-lui.

650
00:49:36,104 --> 00:49:37,171
What's the matter?

651
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:39,469
Take a look at yourself.

652
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:42,309
It is so sharp!

653
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,279
I don't mind nails,
but I want it cooked well.

654
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,475
It's not steak, I don't want it raw.

655
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:55,489
I don't eat half done nails.

656
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,824
Do you want to kill me?

657
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:58,849
What do you want?

658
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:01,395
You've gone too far!

659
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:04,231
If you want to mess up,
you must use better trick

660
00:50:04,232 --> 00:50:07,301
How can you add so many nails
into the pot at the same time

661
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:09,470
On one would be so stupid to cook
like this. This is a set up.

662
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:11,105
It's hard to say

663
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:14,909
There was precedent from your chef.

664
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,968
What did you say

665
00:50:23,518 --> 00:50:27,954
Wong Bing-Yi, this is the present
from Master Joe

666
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:31,725
Don't worry.

667
00:50:31,726 --> 00:50:37,289
This is the pork done by Chef Tin,
no problem.

668
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,465
You'd better watch out

669
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:48,275
Why?

670
00:50:48,276 --> 00:50:50,539
What does that mean?

671
00:51:11,066 --> 00:51:15,002
I can't imagine our business
would become this worse.

672
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:18,168
Don't panic

673
00:51:19,608 --> 00:51:21,675
Why not?

674
00:51:21,676 --> 00:51:25,145
Now, we have no customers to come.

675
00:51:25,146 --> 00:51:29,309
If this goes on,
our restaurant will be closed.

676
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:32,686
Who brought this bad luck to us,
huh?

677
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:41,361
Brother Choi,
are you here for shopping?

678
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:46,366
Let me handle it.

679
00:51:52,607 --> 00:51:56,235
We'd better not talk behind someone

680
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,938
Don't mess up.

681
00:52:02,484 --> 00:52:07,182
I don't want to be bullied
but say nothing.

682
00:52:10,225 --> 00:52:11,759
Boss, how is it?

683
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,522
How are you?

684
00:52:16,765 --> 00:52:19,466
Bitch! You're looking for trouble!

685
00:52:19,467 --> 00:52:20,200
What's up?

686
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:21,895
Get lost!

687
00:52:22,837 --> 00:52:24,634
What's up?

688
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,434
What are you doing?

689
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:32,939
Stop!

690
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:47,446
So? Be a hero?

691
00:53:54,562 --> 00:53:56,120
Go!

692
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:40,207
What's up?

693
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:41,936
Run!

694
00:54:51,252 --> 00:54:54,354
Stop!

695
00:54:54,355 --> 00:54:56,590
Freeze!

696
00:54:56,591 --> 00:54:57,357
Stay where you are!

697
00:54:57,358 --> 00:54:59,917
Freeze!

698
00:55:00,528 --> 00:55:03,292
Hurry up!

699
00:55:03,731 --> 00:55:04,665
Stop!

700
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,656
Freeze!

701
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:08,959
Stop!

702
00:55:28,289 --> 00:55:29,790
What do you want?

703
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,815
No, thanks.

704
00:55:37,732 --> 00:55:40,632
Disgusting! Why did you stop me?

705
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:52,102
Look, you have flour
all over your face.

706
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,330
Come and join the 7th competition
for the ''Best Cook of China''.

707
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:13,600
This campaign is held
once in 4 years, the winner...

708
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:16,803
Will be awarded
the Best Cook of China,

709
00:56:16,804 --> 00:56:18,305
If we win...

710
00:56:18,306 --> 00:56:20,107
then we can save the reputation
of our restaurant.

711
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:22,235
Let's hurry back to tell sister
about this.

712
00:56:41,162 --> 00:56:45,399
My dad is the best cook,
he is the best of the best.

713
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,036
I can win the cup easily.

714
00:56:49,037 --> 00:56:52,631
No one can compete with me.

715
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:58,742
I want a revenge.

716
00:57:07,488 --> 00:57:09,751
Hello...

717
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:12,987
Okay, I'll wait for you.

718
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:17,623
Sorry, I can't go.

719
00:57:20,768 --> 00:57:22,903
Yes, what's the matter?

720
00:57:22,904 --> 00:57:25,606
Master, please tell us.

721
00:57:25,607 --> 00:57:28,208
Sister and I take you as our family.

722
00:57:28,209 --> 00:57:30,939
We can help you!

723
00:57:31,913 --> 00:57:36,008
This matter bothers me
for a long time, I must settle it.

724
00:57:40,755 --> 00:57:42,856
Master, if you don't go,

725
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:44,391
we won't go too.

726
00:57:44,392 --> 00:57:49,295
Ken, this is a
very important competition.

727
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:54,434
What is more important
than the competition?

728
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:56,169
Yes!

729
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,006
It's you and this restaurant.

730
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:01,808
I don't care the name
of being the best cook.

731
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:05,379
For the restaurant,
you must try hard in the competition.

732
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,815
Don't worry, we'll wait for you.

733
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,715
Ken...

734
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:28,192
Take this with you.

735
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:43,150
Now, the competition for the
Best Chef of China begins.

736
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:45,915
All the representatives are now
coming in the studio.

737
00:59:25,293 --> 00:59:27,590
Uncle Yu.

738
00:59:36,738 --> 00:59:38,972
This is a great event
for all great chefs in China.

739
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:41,074
Ladies and gentlemen,
the 7th competition for the Best Chef of China...

740
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:42,776
now begins!

741
00:59:42,777 --> 00:59:45,612
Let me introduce the judges.

742
00:59:45,613 --> 00:59:48,281
Mr. Yu Pun-cheong,
the chairman of the China Cookery Association.

743
00:59:48,282 --> 00:59:49,616
Mr. Liu Chi-wing, the famous chef.

744
00:59:49,617 --> 00:59:51,351
Ms Wong Lai-mui,
from the Catering Alliance.

745
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:53,220
Mr. Wong Wing-chi, the chairman of the
Association For Catering Services Management.

746
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:55,489
Mr. Yu Wing-man, the honorary
chairman of the Chef Association.

747
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,491
Before the competition,

748
00:59:57,492 --> 00:59:59,326
We'd like to
invite the last champion,

749
00:59:59,327 --> 01:00:03,092
Master Tin Chou-dao from the King
of Cantonese Restaurant.

750
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:11,968
Hi, Master Tin.

751
01:00:15,977 --> 01:00:18,377
Master.

752
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:24,408
Is he still your master?

753
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:30,484
Kam-lui.

754
01:00:31,726 --> 01:00:34,353
He is no longer your master.

755
01:00:35,596 --> 01:00:38,231
Fatty,

756
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:40,100
I want to challenge you.

757
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:43,336
Fine, where are you from?

758
01:00:43,337 --> 01:00:45,930
Sum's Restaurant.

759
01:00:47,008 --> 01:00:48,608
Now, I have to tell you the rules.

760
01:00:48,609 --> 01:00:50,277
This is a knockout.

761
01:00:50,278 --> 01:00:53,380
The judgment team will pick
2 teams among the 6.

762
01:00:53,381 --> 01:00:55,816
They will have the final race
in next time.

763
01:00:55,817 --> 01:00:57,384
Now, the theme is knife.

764
01:00:57,385 --> 01:01:00,887
In that case,
other than the outlook and taste,

765
01:01:00,888 --> 01:01:03,089
The chef must express
the skills of cutting.

766
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,659
The cutting skill is a must
of a real chef.

767
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,960
You'll have one hour
for competition.

768
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:10,259
Now, I declare the race begins.

769
01:01:11,999 --> 01:01:14,023
I want to cook Szechwan's style
of Ox head.

770
01:01:16,604 --> 01:01:19,072
I understand what my master means.

771
01:01:19,073 --> 01:01:22,375
Kam-lui, we must win.

772
01:01:22,376 --> 01:01:23,977
Let's charge up.

773
01:01:23,978 --> 01:01:26,246
But what should we do?

774
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:28,482
They are all picking ingredients.

775
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:32,282
Sis, what should we do?

776
01:01:58,412 --> 01:01:59,646
Let's go
''The Four Stuffed Treasures''.

777
01:01:59,647 --> 01:02:01,876
The Four Stuffed Treasures''?

778
01:02:02,316 --> 01:02:04,384
It's more complicated than
''Eight Treasure Duck''.

779
01:02:04,385 --> 01:02:07,353
Don't you have confidence
in your cutting skills?

780
01:02:08,689 --> 01:02:09,956
I got it.

781
01:02:09,957 --> 01:02:14,327
I'll get the chicken, duck,
pigeon and the fillings.

782
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:16,386
And quail too.

783
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:36,609
Sis, what is Tin doing?

784
01:02:42,023 --> 01:02:45,325
This is the famous dish of Szechwan.

785
01:02:45,326 --> 01:02:48,556
It pays much attention in cutting.

786
01:03:10,518 --> 01:03:12,252
The competition is truly excited.

787
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:14,187
Now, we have only...

788
01:03:14,188 --> 01:03:16,246
3 minutes left.

789
01:03:30,104 --> 01:03:32,305
Now, we have only...

790
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:34,171
1 minute.

791
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:37,641
5.

792
01:03:38,512 --> 01:03:40,536
4.

793
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:43,748
3.

794
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:47,717
2.

795
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:53,892
Time's up.

796
01:03:57,431 --> 01:03:59,065
The 6 dishes are...

797
01:03:59,066 --> 01:04:01,968
Grapes and Fish from Wah Shun Hotel.

798
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:04,371
Clams in chicken soup
from Chai-tai Restaurant.

799
01:04:04,372 --> 01:04:06,406
Golden Ox and Duck,
from Wan's Restaurant.

800
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:08,174
Phoenix's tail and peach blossom
from Grandma's Restaurant.

801
01:04:08,175 --> 01:04:10,310
Four Stuffed Treasures
from Sum's Restaurant.

802
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:12,212
Szechwan's Ox Head from the King
of Cantonese Restaurant.

803
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:13,847
Judges,

804
01:04:13,848 --> 01:04:16,043
What a headache!

805
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:21,354
The fish and the clams...

806
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:23,923
The cutting skills and procedures
are all right.

807
01:04:23,924 --> 01:04:26,026
But they picked wrong ingredients.

808
01:04:26,027 --> 01:04:28,294
About the duck,

809
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:32,198
It tastes well and spicy,
it looks good too.

810
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:34,901
However, when it is peeled,

811
01:04:34,902 --> 01:04:37,704
the body of the duck was broken.

812
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:40,974
And the dish from Grandma's
Restaurant, the prawns are fresh,

813
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:43,009
The outlook is nice too.

814
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,478
But the strong taste of wine..

815
01:04:45,479 --> 01:04:46,813
Just covers the taste of prawns.

816
01:04:46,814 --> 01:04:48,615
For the Four Stuffed Treasures,

817
01:04:48,616 --> 01:04:49,849
The cutting skills are excellent.

818
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:53,620
The quail is in the pigeon,
then in the chicken,

819
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:55,955
And finally inside the duck.

820
01:04:55,956 --> 01:04:58,158
It's a mixture of meat,
but with clear and layered taste.

821
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,993
It's really wonderful.

822
01:04:59,994 --> 01:05:04,164
About the Ox Head,
it's really a master piece.

823
01:05:04,165 --> 01:05:06,066
It's a difficult task indeed.

824
01:05:06,067 --> 01:05:07,967
From the cutting skills
and the choice of ingredients,

825
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:10,003
it's of the top level.

826
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:11,771
Wonderful!
This ox-head is really wonderful.

827
01:05:11,772 --> 01:05:14,007
Now the judges
are having the final judgment.

828
01:05:14,008 --> 01:05:17,534
The 2 final teams
will be announced soon, they are...

829
01:05:22,483 --> 01:05:26,186
Ken from the Sum's Restaurant
and Tin from the King of Cantonese Restaurant.

830
01:05:26,187 --> 01:05:28,416
Congratulations!

831
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:31,923
We have made it!

832
01:05:34,962 --> 01:05:37,157
We won!

833
01:05:39,767 --> 01:05:42,360
I wish Master was here with us.

834
01:05:50,611 --> 01:05:53,875
Master, we can enter the final race.

835
01:05:54,448 --> 01:05:56,483
But the other team is...

836
01:05:56,484 --> 01:05:58,679
The Sum's Restaurant.

837
01:06:00,287 --> 01:06:01,921
Master Joe, don't worry.

838
01:06:01,922 --> 01:06:04,287
I can figure it out.

839
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:13,960
Let me go.

840
01:06:29,049 --> 01:06:31,141
Ken...

841
01:06:37,258 --> 01:06:40,283
Come and fight with me
if you're a man.

842
01:06:53,507 --> 01:06:57,067
Ken, watch out!

843
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:10,553
Ken.

844
01:07:12,726 --> 01:07:15,428
Nice food can make people happy.

845
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:17,597
But if the chef isn't happy,

846
01:07:17,598 --> 01:07:20,965
How can he pass happiness
to others through food

847
01:07:22,269 --> 01:07:23,837
When I see you going back
to the village,

848
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:26,806
I can tell you
finally figured it out.

849
01:07:26,807 --> 01:07:28,831
Thank you.

850
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:33,046
I must thank you indeed.

851
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:35,014
If you didn't teach them
whole-heartedly,

852
01:07:35,015 --> 01:07:37,949
They can't enter the final race.

853
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,055
It's all because they are talented.

854
01:08:24,331 --> 01:08:26,958
Ken, thank you.

855
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:30,503
I am so sleepy...

856
01:08:30,504 --> 01:08:32,472
Are you?

857
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:34,634
Don't sleep,

858
01:08:35,476 --> 01:08:39,844
I have many places to go with you.

859
01:08:42,249 --> 01:08:45,843
I have so many things to do with...

860
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:51,014
Why happiness is so short?

861
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:00,492
Because...

862
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:06,265
People have many unhappy times.

863
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:22,780
Ah Yi!

864
01:09:57,224 --> 01:09:59,419
You're something!

865
01:10:01,328 --> 01:10:03,318
Sit down.

866
01:10:09,336 --> 01:10:11,269
What do you want?

867
01:10:11,605 --> 01:10:14,574
Nothing, I just come to see you.

868
01:10:14,575 --> 01:10:16,940
Isn't it too late?

869
01:10:17,077 --> 01:10:18,811
Not late at all.

870
01:10:18,812 --> 01:10:23,544
If you are a bit late,
you will not see him.

871
01:10:24,485 --> 01:10:28,221
Cut the crap, you're not welcomed.

872
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:31,090
I am your nephew,
I came specially to see you.

873
01:10:31,091 --> 01:10:32,992
Why don't you want to see me?

874
01:10:32,993 --> 01:10:36,894
I think I am not heartless.

875
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:40,433
Uncle, your student
wounded my fellows.

876
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:42,535
He should pay for it, right?

877
01:10:42,536 --> 01:10:46,528
You know pretty well
for what you did.

878
01:10:47,775 --> 01:10:50,436
What?

879
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:57,650
You kicked my father away
for the Dragon Head's Blade.

880
01:10:57,651 --> 01:11:00,219
Now, you want to take my cup
for the Best Chef away?

881
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:03,656
This should be what I told you.

882
01:11:03,657 --> 01:11:06,352
Your uncle did nothing wrong.

883
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:10,029
Stop!

884
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,464
No matter you believe it or not.

885
01:11:11,465 --> 01:11:13,666
Your father has his reason to leave.

886
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:17,136
Okay, I have my reason to...

887
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:19,867
Fix that bastard and the bitch.

888
01:11:30,217 --> 01:11:32,985
This is between us,
there is nothing to do with them.

889
01:11:32,986 --> 01:11:34,714
Yeah.

890
01:11:36,557 --> 01:11:38,524
I don't want to do anything to them.

891
01:11:38,525 --> 01:11:42,228
I just bring you some present.

892
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:44,196
Leung.

893
01:11:44,465 --> 01:11:46,165
Master Joe, why not leave him alone?

894
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:48,896
I don't want to repeat.

895
01:11:50,237 --> 01:11:54,774
Well, my fellows accidentally
locked up your student,

896
01:11:54,775 --> 01:11:58,578
And a young girl inside the freezer.

897
01:11:58,579 --> 01:12:02,845
And they accidentally
locked up the door.

898
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:05,885
But don't worry.

899
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:09,844
I've kept the key for you,
do you want it?

900
01:12:10,824 --> 01:12:13,792
I am sorry, I failed to hold it.

901
01:12:14,561 --> 01:12:17,723
The key is inside,
take it or leave it.

902
01:12:19,266 --> 01:12:23,224
You can take time to consider it,
but they just can't wait too long.

903
01:12:37,684 --> 01:12:40,175
I've got no choice.

904
01:12:41,955 --> 01:12:44,252
No!

905
01:12:44,558 --> 01:12:46,685
That key is not the true one.

906
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:49,894
I've got the right one here.

907
01:12:57,204 --> 01:13:00,764
Come on, it's over

908
01:13:04,978 --> 01:13:07,343
Thank you.

909
01:13:08,482 --> 01:13:10,574
I must thank you indeed.

910
01:13:17,057 --> 01:13:20,493
Master Joe has lost control,
please take care.

911
01:13:20,494 --> 01:13:22,518
Take care.

912
01:13:51,758 --> 01:13:53,492
The next Best Chef
will be found soon.

913
01:13:53,493 --> 01:13:55,517
The theme of this final race is...

914
01:13:56,063 --> 01:13:57,163
Soup.

915
01:13:57,164 --> 01:13:59,065
The Chinese always need soup
in the banquet.

916
01:13:59,066 --> 01:14:00,766
Other than making soup,

917
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,201
the participants must achieve
one more thing.

918
01:14:02,202 --> 01:14:03,869
That is...

919
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:05,671
Purity.

920
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:09,266
Sis, what does it mean?

921
01:14:09,509 --> 01:14:11,577
That means, no favour
is the best favour.

922
01:14:11,578 --> 01:14:15,181
So the cook cannot add seasoning
into the soup.

923
01:14:15,182 --> 01:14:16,949
In the arts of cookery,

924
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:20,620
One way is to cook without seasoning,

925
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:23,022
it is to let people eat the real
taste of the food.

926
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:24,724
The best cooks of the Shang
and Chau Dynasty,

927
01:14:24,725 --> 01:14:26,792
They integrated the arts of cookery,

928
01:14:26,793 --> 01:14:29,528
With philosophy.

929
01:14:29,529 --> 01:14:31,197
That is ''Purity is the best''.

930
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:32,665
I can't imagine

931
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:36,802
you'd give up the competition
for that rusty blade.

932
01:14:36,803 --> 01:14:38,704
Do you like this blade?

933
01:14:38,705 --> 01:14:40,406
You really like to be Chief.

934
01:14:40,407 --> 01:14:41,974
Don't blame me of being heartless.

935
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:44,875
I'll let you be the Chief
for one day.

936
01:14:45,646 --> 01:14:48,842
I now declare the beginning
of the competition.

937
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:54,679
Ken, what soup should we make?

938
01:15:13,206 --> 01:15:18,234
Why these cabbages be viewed
as the best food?

939
01:15:18,912 --> 01:15:24,016
Cabbages mean a lot
to the villagers.

940
01:15:24,017 --> 01:15:26,652
They are like our family.

941
01:15:26,653 --> 01:15:28,888
Normally, you won't feel much.

942
01:15:28,889 --> 01:15:32,925
But when you lose it,
you'll feel how much you love it.

943
01:15:32,926 --> 01:15:35,656
You'll understand it in future.

944
01:15:38,065 --> 01:15:39,765
Kam-lui.

945
01:15:39,766 --> 01:15:42,063
Let's do ''Cabbage in Clear Water''.

946
01:15:42,669 --> 01:15:47,663
Master said, the fame of the
''Best Cook'' isn't important to him

947
01:15:49,476 --> 01:15:52,877
Except Sum's Restaurant!

948
01:15:55,315 --> 01:15:58,409
All right, let's do Cabbage
in Clear Water.

949
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:27,341
Master Tin, how can you
get these ingredients...

950
01:16:27,914 --> 01:16:30,780
Preparation is always important
to achieve success.

951
01:16:32,519 --> 01:16:35,121
This dish is named with
''Clear Water'',

952
01:16:35,122 --> 01:16:39,149
it is because the soup is as
clear as water.

953
01:16:47,033 --> 01:16:50,469
The method is, mined the chicken,

954
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,666
Then drop them evenly
inside the chicken soup.

955
01:16:57,711 --> 01:17:01,414
When it sinks,

956
01:17:01,415 --> 01:17:06,909
It'll absorb the remained fats
and other materials.

957
01:18:11,685 --> 01:18:14,483
Kam-lui, give me the cabbages.

958
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:19,024
This is not normal cabbages.

959
01:18:19,025 --> 01:18:23,791
We must pick the heart
of the cabbages.

960
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:34,406
Then, get some fine needles.

961
01:18:34,407 --> 01:18:38,741
Stab the needles into the leaves
to make numerous fine holds.

962
01:18:39,079 --> 01:18:42,446
But don't ruin the outlook
of the cabbages.

963
01:19:08,675 --> 01:19:10,843
Then, add the cooked soup...

964
01:19:10,844 --> 01:19:14,280
into the pot with cabbages.

965
01:19:14,281 --> 01:19:17,306
And then put it into the steamer
for steaming.

966
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:34,195
What is it about?

967
01:19:36,169 --> 01:19:39,204
For traditional method,
only the bottom is heated.

968
01:19:39,205 --> 01:19:41,006
All the heat comes from the bottom.

969
01:19:41,007 --> 01:19:45,277
Now, he uses this device,

970
01:19:45,278 --> 01:19:48,474
So it will receive heat evenly
all over the pot.

971
01:21:34,921 --> 01:21:39,992
When it is opened, even the Buddha
is attracted to jump over the wall for it.

972
01:21:39,993 --> 01:21:42,995
''Buddha jumps the wall'',
it is absolutely the best soup of the world.

973
01:21:42,996 --> 01:21:47,125
''Cabbage in Clear Water''
is no match for it.

974
01:21:55,275 --> 01:21:57,367
Wait.

975
01:22:05,552 --> 01:22:09,488
Make it a signature dish
of Sum's Restaurant.

976
01:22:20,633 --> 01:22:25,263
Sis, that's my bean cube.

977
01:22:42,522 --> 01:22:44,512
Dragon Head's Blade.

978
01:23:09,983 --> 01:23:12,849
How come the bean cube disappeared?

979
01:23:26,299 --> 01:23:29,635
Why the Szechwan cook view this
as treasure?

980
01:23:29,636 --> 01:23:33,806
To make great food with some cheap
and common ingredients,

981
01:23:33,807 --> 01:23:36,408
It is the top level of cookery.

982
01:23:36,409 --> 01:23:39,778
And it implies the top level
of life performance.

983
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:42,514
This is the real taste of food.

984
01:23:42,515 --> 01:23:45,643
Purity!

985
01:24:42,008 --> 01:24:43,175
The result is,

986
01:24:43,176 --> 01:24:47,703
Ken Lung from Sum's Restaurant
is the new Best Cook of China.

987
01:24:48,348 --> 01:24:52,375
Bravo! Wonderful!

988
01:25:01,527 --> 01:25:03,585
Brother.

989
01:25:04,831 --> 01:25:08,425
Since you have come,
why not have a sip?

990
01:25:33,159 --> 01:25:35,991
This is the taste of cabbage.

991
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:40,132
Who is he?

992
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:42,167
We haven't seen for ages,
how are you?

993
01:25:42,168 --> 01:25:43,965
I am fine.

994
01:25:44,604 --> 01:25:48,562
Master Wong, how are you doing?

995
01:25:50,476 --> 01:25:53,578
Is she Sam Ching?
Right.

996
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:55,514
So you must be Sum Ying.

997
01:25:55,515 --> 01:25:58,850
Sis, is he...

998
01:25:58,851 --> 01:26:03,188
He is our father's student,
Master Wong Bing-kei.

999
01:26:03,189 --> 01:26:05,350
Dad...

1000
01:26:06,759 --> 01:26:09,594
Dad, please don't leave.

1001
01:26:09,595 --> 01:26:12,364
Dad...

1002
01:26:12,365 --> 01:26:14,433
Dad...

1003
01:26:14,434 --> 01:26:16,367
I did it wrong!

1004
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:22,774
Ken, my brother and I think that
you're the best one to have this blade.

1005
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:25,210
We hope you can make good food
with it.

1006
01:26:25,211 --> 01:26:27,975
To give happiness to the world!

1007
01:26:36,322 --> 01:26:38,690
I will leave tomorrow.

1008
01:26:38,691 --> 01:26:40,392
So soon.

1009
01:26:40,393 --> 01:26:41,827
This is my plan.

1010
01:26:41,828 --> 01:26:43,328
I have something for you.

1011
01:26:43,329 --> 01:26:44,629
It's made by me.

1012
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:46,722
Sorry.

1013
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:59,167
Don't be sad.

1014
01:27:02,515 --> 01:27:06,849
I've tried it.

1015
01:27:07,053 --> 01:27:09,987
What you made is best.

1016
01:27:11,991 --> 01:27:14,092
I don't know what sister
is thinking.

1017
01:27:14,093 --> 01:27:17,687
Why makes you learn cooking skills
from Wong?

1018
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:23,735
Master is a great cook, it's really
your luck to learn cookery from him.

1019
01:27:23,736 --> 01:27:26,033
I don't care.

1020
01:27:27,173 --> 01:27:30,870
I'll leave this happiness to you!

1021
01:27:31,044 --> 01:27:32,044
No laughing.

1022
01:27:32,045 --> 01:27:35,414
Look at you! You're so handsome!

1023
01:27:35,415 --> 01:27:36,581
Really?

1024
01:27:36,582 --> 01:27:38,350
You have rosy cheeks!

1025
01:27:38,351 --> 01:27:40,185
I am sure you don't have
female students in school.

1026
01:27:40,186 --> 01:27:42,754
Haven't you been touched by women?

1027
01:27:42,755 --> 01:27:44,688
So what?

1028
01:27:46,559 --> 01:27:49,127
No matter you're not gentleman like.

1029
01:27:49,128 --> 01:27:51,563
And you are stupid!

1030
01:27:51,564 --> 01:27:53,932
You are so dull!

1031
01:27:53,933 --> 01:27:58,028
You don't understand girls at all!

1032
01:27:58,805 --> 01:28:00,605
But I can cook

1033
01:28:00,606 --> 01:28:02,971
No need to understand girls
