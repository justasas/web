00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,334
This is our latest collection.

8
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:46,751
Would you like to look at this one?

9
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,084
This is a robbery!

10
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,751
Don't move!

11
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:51,084
Lie down!

12
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:02,042
What are you doing? I said lie down! Are you deaf?

13
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,459
No.

14
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:05,417
You said don't move, so how can I lie down?

15
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,001
And if I lie down, then why can't I move?

16
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:12,417
Ah, we have a talkative guy!

17
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,209
You're one smart little monkey,

18
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:15,542
aren't you?

19
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,709
Aren't you?

20
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,459
Freeze! Don't move!

21
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,751
We're at the scene and need backup!

22
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:27,626
Stay away!

23
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,709
- Sir
- The suspect is inside holding 50 people hostage.

24
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,376
Call the negotiation team

25
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:37,959
- and have SDU on standby.
- Yes sir!

26
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:32,292
Don't come any closer!

27
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,209
Or I'll kill her!

28
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:44,876
I'm inspector Lau Chi-wai.

29
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:46,417
Tell me what your demands are,

30
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:48,042
but don't hurt the hostages.

31
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,542
- Get me a car!
- Wait!

32
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,834
It's horse racing day so traffic's bad...A plane!

33
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:54,417
Get me a helicopter in 15 minutes...

34
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,209
...otherwise I'll kill her!

35
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:58,959
Errr inspector...

36
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:00,917
I'm hungry-

37
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,376
How's it going?

38
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,959
The suspect's mentally unstable.

39
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,417
We'd better agree to some of his demands.

40
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,084
He wants pizza.

41
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:23,584
Get over here!

42
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,042
Not you!

43
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,542
The pizza boy!

44
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,376
- Which do you want?
- I want the stuffed crust one.

45
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:31,501
We don't make those...

46
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,709
What do you mean you don't make them?
And you call yourself a pizza delivery?

47
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,084
Well, you didn't order the stuffed crust
in the beginning.

48
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:36,751
How can it be good without the cheese inside?

49
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,084
No way, I want the stuffed crust.

50
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,667
What's so great about the cheese? It's fattening
and has tons of cholesterol.

51
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:42,209
I don't care, I'll kill this chick!

52
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,167
Fine, okay.

53
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,709
Don't get so worked up.

54
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:47,167
I'll order one for you right now.

55
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,584
Hey, where's the helicopter?
There's just three minutes left!

56
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,834
OK, calm down.

57
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,084
Look, I fulfilled one of your demands already.

58
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,084
Shouldn't you let some hostages

59
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,834
- go at least?
- I don't care!

60
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:57,417
If the helicopter doesn't get here in 3 minutes,

61
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:58,584
I'll kill this foreign girl!

62
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,334
L...have Hong Kong permanent residency!

63
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:03,209
- You smart ass!
- Hey!

64
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:09,209
Go,go,go!

65
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,959
Go where? The guy's already surrendered. Go home!

66
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,959
As long as the helicopter doesn't
get here in 3 minutes, I'll shoot her!

67
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,251
Hello?

68
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,667
Seriously?

69
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,042
The female hostage just now...

70
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:46,834
...her nipples were hard under her dress.

71
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:48,459
You see everything!

72
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,334
I don't know why you think it's such a big deal.

73
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,459
I don't understand how women can go out
and not wear a bra!

74
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:54,084
What's the big problem?

75
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:56,126
The girls in Boston don't wear bras either.

76
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,167
Without bras,

77
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:00,292
it's normal that their nipples jut out.

78
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:02,917
For fuck's sake...

79
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:05,084
...this ABC can speak Cantonese
but always uses English words.

80
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:06,917
It's so complicated to use three syllables:

81
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,292
Nip-ple-s.

82
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,459
In Cantonese it's so much easier:

83
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,001
I-I-n!

84
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,001
Hey, what time is
the Portugal vs. England game tonight?

85
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,584
11pm. But why bother, Portugal will lose.

86
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,292
No no, I want to see Cristiano Ronaldo.

87
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:19,542
What's so great about him?

88
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,626
- His skills with the ball!
- You can watch Ronaldo,

89
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,709
and I'll surf for my porn.

90
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:24,667
Enlarge it!

91
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,167
No, rotate it, "then" you enlarge it.

92
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,459
Damn dirty horny bastards.

93
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:32,876
Bro! We're in a police van.

94
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,876
You can drive faster!

95
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,501
You won't get a ticket!

96
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:45,376
I'll shower first.

97
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:46,667
Go ahead.

98
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:53,334
"Regarding SDU Training course in United States."

99
00:06:53,501 --> 00:07:01,542
"Headquarter decided to send A-team to States
in order to unleash their best qualities."

100
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:12,209
You're looking for me?

101
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,042
Sir, I want to know why you chose the A-team?

102
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:21,501
You know that SDU hasn't won
a single award in many years.

103
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,751
This year we have a chance...

104
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:26,042
...since the SAS team isn't that strong.

105
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:28,667
Don't be like that. You know your B-team

106
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,084
can't even run 10km in half an hour!

107
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:34,334
Sir, it was raining the last time we ran.
A-team didn't have to face the rain.

108
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,834
This is just one of the problems.

109
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,667
Hey, how's your English?

110
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,126
I dated a white girl before!

111
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,001
OK. How do you spell "September"?

112
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,417
S-E-P...

113
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,459
I'm definitely faster than Joe at loading guns...

114
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:55,126
...and he can't beat me in close quarter combat!

115
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,292
A team is not just about one person.

116
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:59,126
You gotta have team spirit!

117
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,126
Josh told me that he wants to move to A-team.

118
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,459
- Huh?
- If you were a good leader...

119
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:05,209
...then your team members wouldn't ask for that.

120
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:07,542
Josh wants to transfer to A-team?

121
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:10,126
I was working, how can I answer the phone?

122
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,084
Of course you can answer your phone anytime.

123
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,917
You're a receptionist!

124
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:20,292
I thought if one person signs then it's okay?

125
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,751
No.

126
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,042
I used to deal with your father as well.

127
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,292
This is a long-term contract...

128
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:27,959
...I must have both signatures.

129
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:30,459
You should speak with him quickly.

130
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,084
This is a

131
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,501
good buyer...

132
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:37,251
- Shall I...
- No, definitely not. Let me think it over.

133
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,084
Hey, is there anything else?
If not then I'm leaving.

134
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,292
Who said we're done?

135
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,959
Let me take a shower, then we'll go for a drink.

136
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,834
Who's more attractive to you
girls with big chests.

137
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,584
Or girls with flat chests but no bras?

138
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,751
What the fuck is up with your question?

139
00:08:58,126 --> 00:08:59,501
Why can't big-breasted girls also not wear bras?

140
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:00,751
Why should I choose?

141
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:03,167
Yeah, your question already has problems.

142
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,751
But if I really have to choose?

143
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,084
OK, then...

144
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:07,209
...big-chested girls.

145
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:08,501
You're totally shameless!

146
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:11,001
Hey Missy, I can't always be around you 24-7...

147
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,834
...I need time for myself too.

148
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:18,626
Never mind, if you're not happy being with me...

149
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,376
...let's break up.

150
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,584
I tell you this, Cheung Suk-yee...

151
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,542
...it's not that I don't understand you.

152
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,459
You don't understand me either!

153
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,667
Maybe we should've gotten to know each other
better before we started.

154
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:43,876
No need.

155
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,709
Just throw them all away.

156
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,584
But that's really how she asked!

157
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:50,542
What?

158
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,167
They are talking about the other departments
going out for "special massages".

159
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:54,917
So I went in...

160
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:56,917
...and she asked me if I wanted a facial!

161
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:58,667
Fuck no, I didn't come for a facial.

162
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:00,584
I came for a...

163
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:01,751
Thanks!

164
00:10:02,584 --> 00:10:05,417
So I told her I didn't want a facial.

165
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,084
And I still regret it to this day!

166
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:09,417
Why?

167
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:11,876
Do you know what a facial is?

168
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:13,917
They mean using this pair...

169
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:15,917
...right over here.
Then she pushes your face into them...

170
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:17,376
...and then the facial begins!

171
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,334
Hey, hey!

172
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,167
Sorry, sorry.

173
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,667
Sorry! Speaking of which,

174
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,209
why don't we get going already?

175
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:24,501
Are you sure? If you're up for it,

176
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,584
then I'm in!

177
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,834
I'm ready anytime!

178
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,084
Right now?

179
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,042
I'm watching the game...

180
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,584
Umm...yes, it's about to start.

181
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:33,834
Watching others score...

182
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,542
...while you yourself can't score is just stupid.

183
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:36,959
Come on, let's go!

184
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:37,959
So this is serious?

185
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:40,626
If so, then I gotta call my morn to
tell her I'll be back late.

186
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,501
Fucking hell, you're a mama's boy?

187
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,126
Will you ask for your mom's permission...

188
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,542
...before shooting a robber?

189
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:46,459
What the fuck are you doing?

190
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,876
He's called Dried Shrimp,
so of course he's gonna be wimpy.

191
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:51,292
By the way, why are you called Dried Shrimp?

192
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,542
Just say it. You'd tell it sooner or later anyway.

193
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,251
- Fine, you're the one who OKs it.
- Well?

194
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,417
You didn't join the team yet...

195
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,209
...but during Chinese New Year last year
there was a big case.

196
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:02,084
I've heard of it.

197
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,709
...and our Dried Shrimp here gained
his fame as a hero.

198
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,251
We received some intelligence...

199
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,751
and the two teams set off for
the criminal Wang Tao's den.

200
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:13,417
Got to the target location,
carefully standby at the back door.

201
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:16,417
First broke the through the front door, then light bomb

202
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:17,751
and barged in the house.

203
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:20,126
Dried Shrimp was guarding the front door,

204
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,251
we got in and there we see someone
lying on the floor...

205
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,459
...as we moved closer...

206
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:27,417
...they opened fire at us...

207
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:28,792
...it was definitely "let the bullets fly".

208
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,667
It was so small and crowded...

209
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:33,417
...just had to carry on and fight.

210
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,167
They fire, we fire.

211
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:36,501
We fire, they fire.

212
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,167
They fire, we fire.

213
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:42,667
Suddenly..."boom", the ceiling came crashing down.

214
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:44,667
It was Wang Tao, he blew up the wall
so that he can escape.

215
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:48,334
Dried Shrimp received call and chased after him...

216
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,376
...he got shot twice.

217
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,792
Luckily he wore bullet-proof vest.

218
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,751
Wang Tao walked up to him
and open fired at his head.

219
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,834
He was shit scared and curled up into a ball.

220
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,334
The lucky boy, the bullet got caught
and didn't hit him.

221
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,042
Wang Tao then ran off.

222
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:02,626
The ambulance came

223
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:05,042
and he was still curled up like a Dried Shrimp.

224
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,792
And you know what? The name Dried Shrimp

225
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:09,417
is now renowned throughout the police force.

226
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:10,751
Fuck you man!

227
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:12,626
If it wasn't for you, no one would call me that!

228
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,751
Hey, but no one is lying here.

229
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:14,709
When we got there,

230
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:16,834
he really was curled up
like a dried shrimp.

231
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:20,417
To be fair, I think it's OK. At least you tried.

232
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:22,626
Exactly! If I see him again,

233
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:24,251
I will personally arrest him!

234
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,834
Now this is a perfect example of...

235
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:28,042
...all talk and no action!

236
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:30,126
Hahaha.

237
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,501
So what do you think of the match tonight?

238
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,959
You're nuts! Portugal's
bound to lose England has Beckham!

239
00:12:36,126 --> 00:12:38,834
I don't think so, I think England will fuck it up.

240
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:42,001
Portugal...will lose for sure.
It's just a matter of by how much.

241
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,417
- Are you so sure?
- Totally sure!

242
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:44,667
Then why don't we bet on it?

243
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,584
$2000. We just bet on

244
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,167
- who wins and loses.
- Hey, I want in on it too!

245
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:50,917
This doesn't involve you!

246
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:54,042
I will only bet with one other person.

247
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,667
You're not scared, are you?

248
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,334
Shall we listen to my suggestion?

249
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:05,209
What now?

250
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:07,209
Instead of wasting money on a bet...

251
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:08,959
...why not spend it on a blowjob instead?

252
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,084
Let's go!

253
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:12,126
You're a fucking pervert always talking
about kinky subjects.

254
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,542
If we hurry up then we can still make it
to Shanghai Street.

255
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,167
Instead of Shanghai Street,
why don't we just go to Macau?

256
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:19,876
There's a new place that just opened
there called "No. 1 Clubhouse".

257
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,251
- Really nice.
- What is it?

258
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:23,417
A nightclub and the girls are sizzling hot.

259
00:13:23,876 --> 00:13:25,459
Going to Macau is not a bad idea.

260
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:26,959
We can eat crab congee there too!

261
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:28,417
Fucking dumb-ass!

262
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:32,126
We're talking about call girls
and you talk about crab congee!

263
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:34,251
Come on, if we hurry we can also
catch the game as well!

264
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:35,876
Stop. You guys remember what's in PGO?

265
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,792
SDU is a sensitive unit...

266
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:39,292
...we must register before we can leave
the territory.

267
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:40,292
Then call the boss

268
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,792
and tell him you're going
to Macau! There, registered!

269
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,251
Are you nuts? It's 8pm on a Friday night...

270
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,876
...and you want to call the boss
and tell him we're going to Macau!

271
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,626
Why not just tell him that
we're going for prostitutes!

272
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:48,959
- Then just say it. What's the big deal?
- You guys call him then.

273
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:49,917
I'm not doing it.

274
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:54,709
Someone told me there's an exhibition
on relics going on there.

275
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,292
Let's just tell our boss we're attending that!

276
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:00,792
Actually, I'm a devout Buddhist.

277
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,501
But how do you say the word in English?

278
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,584
I know!

279
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:04,917
She-le-chi

280
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:06,001
Fuck you!

281
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,459
It's not that hard, is it?

282
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:09,834
It's considered rather blasphemous, but let's go.

283
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:12,626
Wait wait, this really doesn't work.

284
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:16,501
The four of us going together
to Macau on a Friday night...

285
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,917
to see relics?

286
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:20,709
Seriously?

287
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:22,501
He has a point.

288
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:27,667
Forget about it. Let's just watch the game.

289
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,542
It's not like we don't have other solutions.

290
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,501
Really?

291
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,876
Before I was in SDU...

292
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:36,084
...I was part of an operation in Pak Nai.

293
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,834
We detected a speedboat gang

294
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,626
smuggling illegal immigrants into Macau.

295
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,876
Seriously? Smuggling people into Macau?

296
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,917
Sure! For example, some are out on bail...

297
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,876
...but want to go gambling.

298
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:52,001
At Pak Nai, you pay,
and then they bring you over to Macau.

299
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,709
When you're finished...

300
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:56,626
...you just catch a ride back!

301
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:59,501
Sounds exciting! Then we can even go
and eat crab congee.

302
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:00,709
Yes, you're right!

303
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,459
Wow you really do love crab congee!

304
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,542
That's because it's really good!
If you're there, how can you not try some?

305
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,876
Like I said, if we want to go,
we can already be on that boat.

306
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:14,001
What's everyone's opinion?

307
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,001
I just follow the others.

308
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:22,292
Look, we're police officers and SDU members.

309
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:24,376
You're seriously suggesting that
we illegally smuggle ourselves

310
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:26,334
into Macau to look for prostitutes?!

311
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,834
It's so ridiculous.

312
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:30,876
If you're that desperate...

313
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:34,501
...I'll go with you to Shanghai Street instead.

314
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,251
OK?

315
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,542
Girls we will definitely get...

316
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:41,834
...but how often do we have
the whole B-team together like this?

317
00:15:42,334 --> 00:15:44,917
Why be such cheapskates?

318
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,042
Let's be sugar daddies together!

319
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,417
That's right,

320
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:50,584
we'll be the best team ever!

321
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,917
It's too dangerous!

322
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,084
If you don't even have the guts
to face such dangers...

323
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,959
...then why are you still with SDU?

324
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,251
We've handled much riskier missions before.

325
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,417
You aren't afraid to shoot guns...
...but you're scared to shoot your load?

326
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:04,584
It's not that I don't dare, but do we really
have to smuggle ourselves across?

327
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:07,459
Why don't we ask everyone in the team?

328
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:10,709
Why don't we ask everyone in the team?
If you agree to go, raise your hands.

329
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,001
Forget it, you guys go ahead.
I'm gonna stay and watch the game.

330
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,542
- Let's go! what are we waiting for?
- Sit down!

331
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:27,917
We're a team, that means we stick together.
This is called "team spirit"!

332
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:29,292
If even one of us won't go...

333
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,626
...then the whole operation is called off.
So now we all watch the football match together.

334
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,084
What the fuck? This is ridiculous!

335
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,792
I need to fuck, he doesn't.
So why don't I get to go?

336
00:16:39,584 --> 00:16:42,417
Come on, let's all go together.

337
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,459
To be honest, I've never hired a hooker before.

338
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:46,876
When it comes to call girls...

339
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,334
...you just need to know two words:

340
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:50,501
...in and out.

341
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,417
It's either going in or coming out.

342
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:55,417
If you choose someone right for you,
then you lie down.

343
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,751
Whoever finishes first and gets up, wins.

344
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:00,626
- Isn't that right?
- But isn't there

345
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,501
an easier way to do this?

346
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:03,709
Nope.

347
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,084
Desperate times require desperate measures.

348
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,167
I christen this operation...

349
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,209
..."Sex War"!

350
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,834
This is for the unity of our B-team.

351
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,792
Josh Chan, whether this operation succeeds
or not depends on you!

352
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,751
You know I've had this flu for over half a year.

353
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,792
Maybe if you let me sweat it out...

354
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,459
...I'll get better.

355
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,626
So help me out here, okay?

356
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:29,459
- Fine, whatever.
- Good going, men! Synchronize watches!

357
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:31,459
Dismiss!

358
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:34,459
We go immediately to get ferry tickets!

359
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,334
I thought we're sneaking across,
so what's this about tickets?

360
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:37,876
You still gotta act smart.

361
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:38,876
Sergeant, you sort out the tickets.

362
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:40,042
I'm gonna quickly pop over to Yuen Long.

363
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,042
Then we meet at Pak Nai.

364
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:43,542
No.1 Clubhouse, it's here.

365
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:48,042
Hey, big guys! Come in, come in.

366
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:50,126
We don't have time. We need 4 tickets
to No.1 Clubhouse immediately.

367
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:52,001
But there are many different packages.
Tons of choices,

368
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,042
like the "Environmental Blowjob".
Come in and we'll chat!

369
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,251
- Wait, what's an "Environmental Blowjob"?
- Just come in

370
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,667
- and chat first.
- Wait, what's an "Environmental Blowjob"?

371
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,459
What would you like, boss?

372
00:17:58,792 --> 00:17:59,542
Some "magic water".

373
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:00,542
What brand?

374
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:01,542
The strongest one.

375
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,001
Okay, please wait.

376
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,876
So this is what you need to buy?

377
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,126
It's much more fun with it.

378
00:18:08,876 --> 00:18:10,042
Oh! The "Environmental Blowjob"

379
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,042
The "Environmental Blowjob" doesn't use condoms.

380
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:14,209
Less condoms used means less rubbish.

381
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,584
So it's more environmentally friendly, hooray!

382
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,834
So what does "Best Young Selection" mean?

383
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,917
- It means little girls.
- Fuck off!

384
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,459
- ...How little are you talking?
- Minors!

385
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:28,126
No way, that's messed up!

386
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,251
...Are you serious?

387
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,542
Of course not.

388
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,584
You go ahead and buy it. I'm good.

389
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,417
Why are you so difficult?

390
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,376
Asking what this is and how much it costs...

391
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,584
Once we're there,

392
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:46,542
every second costs money.

393
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,001
With this medicine...

394
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:53,126
...it basically guarantees your money's worth.

395
00:18:53,876 --> 00:18:56,001
Do you really need to go to such extremes?

396
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,584
Our money is earned through our sweat and blood.

397
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,251
So I'm not gonna waste even a cent of it.

398
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,876
There are lots more selections here.
What's up your alley?

399
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,959
Do you prefer

400
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:07,626
chest or ass?

401
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:10,792
You can double up overnight by
starting at No.1 Clubhouse...

402
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,417
...then we go for a Darling massage
and finish off with a night's stay.

403
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:16,751
All for $3800 per person. What a bargain!

404
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,376
It's too expensive. Got anything else?

405
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,376
Ah I understand.

406
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:23,542
I'll introduce something else to you then.

407
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,292
Let me introduce these to you.

408
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:28,709
This oil comes from India.

409
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,376
This is called "Never Gonna Fall".

410
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:34,834
And this new product from Taiwan
is called the "101 Tower".

411
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:38,751
These aren't right for you?
How about this one: "The Weeping Woman".

412
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,542
The Weeping Woman?

413
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:44,792
Dad! Sorry...Why do you still want to sell these?

414
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:47,542
The last time you used it,
the women still haven't fully recovered!

415
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:50,251
Don't you feel bad for them?

416
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,251
Yes, that's right, this one is too strong!

417
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,542
Girls aren't right for you?
Then how about muscled guys?

418
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:55,834
Why would I want guys?!

419
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,751
And why do the men look kinda dark?

420
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:00,459
They are Thai!

421
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,251
Thai boys are more popular these days.

422
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,667
But hustlers are a bit more expensive
than hookers. Yeah!

423
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:07,459
How much more?

424
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:09,084
One cock equals three chicks!

425
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,584
Hey, don't waste time talking about this!

426
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:14,251
No need to be upset.

427
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:16,042
We have plenty to choose from.
Just give me a minute!

428
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:17,376
Hold on.

429
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,376
Everyone's bodily needs is different.
I'll take this one!

430
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:24,001
No really...This one is too powerful,
and it's expensive to boot.

431
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,251
Expensive means that it's effective. I'll take it!

432
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:29,417
These three are $300 each. But this one is $1000!

433
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,126
- Give me 4 bottles.
- Wait a minute none for me,

434
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,542
so just 3 bottles.

435
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:33,626
3 bottles!

436
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,292
Dear, please get <i>2</i> more of these.

437
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:36,126
Dad!

438
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:37,709
Just listen to dad!

439
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:40,959
Mules!

440
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:43,417
They are a big hit recently.

441
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:47,417
But you need one week of advance booking.

442
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:49,334
Not to worry,

443
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,417
horses and sheep are readily available!

444
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,542
Stop telling me about animals!

445
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:56,876
Just give me 4 tickets to
No. 1 Clubhouse, that's it!

446
00:20:57,042 --> 00:21:00,417
Fine, fine. But you're sure
you're not into animals?

447
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:09,542
You're thinking I've done it before?!

448
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:12,251
No...Anyways, let me make a call first.

449
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:18,459
Yes...we're paying now.

450
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:21,084
Oh, thank you!

451
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:24,209
Just a friendly reminder, only two drops.
Don't go overboard.

452
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,792
Just give them to me.

453
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,209
- No need for bags.
- Thank you!

454
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,751
- Let's go.
- Hey, you hold it!

455
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,917
See,dad?

456
00:21:36,084 --> 00:21:37,667
I told you this is how to sell them!

457
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:40,834
Your acting classes are really proving useful!

458
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,376
We earned another $3000.

459
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:49,042
Big Fei-Lung? Yes, Peter referred me to you.
You got a boat going to Macau?

460
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:52,459
4 people, 15 minutes...Wait for us,
we're on our way.

461
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,542
You're kidding, they say England will
win the cup this year!

462
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,667
Why is it surprising?
They have Beckham and Rooney.

463
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:01,626
Beckham? When do they ever do well when he plays?

464
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,501
Football is all about teamwork.

465
00:22:07,917 --> 00:22:08,959
What's up?

466
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,292
The car is stalling. Should we check it first?

467
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,792
Is it the car or is it you who's stalling?
They said in 15 minutes.

468
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,209
Fine.

469
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:32,251
Take all your money out!

470
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,334
Ka Ho, you take care of the cash.

471
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:39,376
So we put our wallets, IDs and keys into the bag.

472
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:43,959
Lock it inside the car.

473
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,126
It's not safe to leave it here.

474
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,876
Yes it's not safe, but it's still safer
than taking them to Macau.

475
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,251
If we get searched there,

476
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,376
at least they won't know we are SDU.

477
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:55,584
This time we just take the cash
and our phones. Are we clear?

478
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:56,959
No problem.

479
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,501
B-team, ready?

480
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,001
Yes sir!

481
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,167
Let's go.

482
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,542
Hi, Mr. Lee! Hello everyone.

483
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:21,042
I just need to put some goods on board
then we can take off.

484
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,376
Hey, there's four of us, so here's $4000.

485
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:25,376
No rush, no rush! Please board first.

486
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,626
- Alright, everything's sorted.
- Good.

487
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:32,376
Here's some lemon tea. It won't be long now.

488
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:34,292
- Thanks.
- Here!

489
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:35,917
- Thanks.
- You're not sitting with us?

490
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:37,584
I get sea sick.

491
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,709
What did he say?

492
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:42,209
He gets sea sick.

493
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:45,209
He's afraid of seasickness?
Then why doesn't he just walk to Macau?

494
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:46,626
Maybe walking there will make him even sicker.

495
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:17,667
Hey, it's Friday night, so there'll be
lots of people at N01. Clubhouse.

496
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:19,209
Do you want me

497
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,459
- to call you a taxi?
- No need, it's fine.

498
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,084
But this No.1 Clubhouse place, is it any good?

499
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:25,167
- I've never been there.
- What?

500
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:26,917
You live in Macau...

501
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:28,167
...and you've never been there?

502
00:24:28,376 --> 00:24:31,626
I've been to enough of those places
when I was younger. My daughter is almost 3.

503
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,417
You guys have fun.

504
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:36,542
I'll be at the bar at the end of the street.
When you guys finish, call me.

505
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,084
When will you be done?

506
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:39,417
Oh...in 5 hours.

507
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:42,001
Don't leave without us, ok? Give him $1000.

508
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:43,626
No problem.

509
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:48,292
We must leave before sunrise,
otherwise too many marine police around.

510
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:49,709
We'll call you then.

511
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:52,792
Thanks, and have a great time!

512
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:12,959
Welcome!

513
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,459
Please hold on, you'll be up soon.

514
00:25:21,334 --> 00:25:22,334
OK, OK.

515
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,167
Sir, did you make a prior reservation?

516
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:27,334
Reservation? I have tickets!

517
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,001
Please wait.

518
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:38,917
Even with tickets, we have to wait?
I'm wilting here!

519
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:41,001
Welcome!

520
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,667
Wow, you're getting hard already?

521
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:10,542
Please come in, handsome!

522
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:11,542
So what?

523
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:13,667
You're so horned up already,

524
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:15,001
and we're not
even close to getting laid yet!

525
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,542
Mind your step.

526
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,834
Hey lady, why do we have to wait, and they don't?

527
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:24,001
They are our VIP guests!

528
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,959
You gentlemen just have tickets,
so you'll have to wait!

529
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:31,542
She looks friendly on the outside,
but inside she's full of disdain!

530
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,376
Do you have rooms now?

531
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:35,751
Yes, straight away!

532
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:37,334
Please come this way!

533
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:39,876
This way please.

534
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:41,751
Bring us some fruits!

535
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,584
- Just a second.
- And ask the mama-san to come!

536
00:26:47,126 --> 00:26:51,584
Welcome, good gentlemen!

537
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:56,959
My name is Andy, Andy Ho...ho. Hahaha!

538
00:26:57,126 --> 00:27:00,334
Hold on...why is the mama-san a man?

539
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:03,334
Sigh, we're a single-parent household,
so I have to act as both mother and father.

540
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,584
Plus, you're not messing around with me...

541
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:08,584
...you're messing with my girls, right?

542
00:27:09,709 --> 00:27:12,084
Anyways, welcome, welcome...

543
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:15,959
Welcome!!!

544
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:19,209
Any special requests?

545
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:22,292
Due to my religious beliefs, I don't eat pork.

546
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:24,459
So you can kindly skip your first round
of the "pork chop" types.

547
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,084
What makes you think the ladies
in the first round will look fat?

548
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,209
It's to make the girls

549
00:27:28,376 --> 00:27:30,001
in the second round look better.

550
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,459
Just skip the nonsense and get to the point.

551
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,167
You guys are veterans!

552
00:27:34,459 --> 00:27:35,792
Hold the pork chop, hold the pork chop.

553
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:38,251
OK! Any other requests?

554
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:39,584
One word:

555
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:40,959
they have to be "experienced".

556
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:45,959
No problem! Older women, right? Hahaha,
the older ones are more experienced...

557
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:47,292
Are you making fun of me?

558
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,417
Relax! Haha...

559
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:57,251
I know, you want big tits! Go!

560
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:59,501
This guy's pretty wacky.

561
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:01,126
Haven't I seen him
at another club before?

562
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,626
People like him, they just go
from one place to another.

563
00:28:03,501 --> 00:28:05,334
Here we go, boss!

564
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:21,751
Congratulations and welcome.

565
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,501
Welcome to Andy Ho Ho's "tit" art exhibit.

566
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,626
I'll let them introduce themselves.

567
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:30,167
Hello, I'm Mani, from Heilongjiang.

568
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,626
Hey long what?

569
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,584
Hi, I'm Linda, and I'm from Dalian.

570
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:34,751
Big Linda!

571
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:37,334
Hello, I'm San San from Tsingtao.

572
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,626
Tsingtao beer?!

573
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,792
Hi everyone, I'm Siaoyee, from Chengdu.

574
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,917
Seoul and Chengdu?

575
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:46,167
I'm Dalina, and I'm from Mexico.

576
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,042
Mexico!

577
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,334
I'm Jolin from Fujian. Pick me!

578
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:52,959
Pick you? Hahaha!

579
00:28:53,126 --> 00:28:55,834
Hi boss, I'm Sze Sze from Guangxi.

580
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:57,042
Guangxi?

581
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:59,292
What's with you?

582
00:28:59,459 --> 00:29:00,751
Umm? Dunno, suddenly I feel scared.

583
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:05,292
Oh yeah! Aren't the ladies pretty?

584
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,126
Gentlemen, please select your choices.

585
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,792
Hey Dried Shrimp, you go first since
you're the most desperate.

586
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:16,751
Hurry up! You're not trying to choose a wife here!

587
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,751
Andy?': <i>Z</i> f

588
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:22,209
Do you have anyone with short hair and no chest

589
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:25,751
but is good at massage therapy?

590
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:28,251
No way, you come all this way

591
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,334
just to look for a tomboy?

592
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,626
So you'd prefer the girls from the first round?

593
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:34,251
Ask a pork chop with no tits to come.

594
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:36,626
Ok, please wait a moment. And you three?

595
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:37,959
Fine, you! Since you were so enthusiastic.

596
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:39,084
Jolin!

597
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:41,376
- Second from the left!
- Linda!

598
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:43,209
Are you okay?

599
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:49,751
- First left.
- Sorry?

600
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:51,751
- First left!
- First left!

601
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,709
Mani!

602
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,751
- Did you need to be that loud?
- He can't hear me!

603
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:58,834
Congrats! Wow, I can't believe that in just the

604
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:03,126
1st go all the clients have made their choices.

605
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,709
This is truly amazing!

606
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:08,959
Andy, do we pay $200 extra for a trainee?

607
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:11,584
Of course! We have trainees. Who wants one?

608
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:13,584
- All of us.
- Not me.

609
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,501
This isn't just about you.

610
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:19,001
These girls came all the way to Macau

611
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:22,292
just to make a bit of money.

612
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:25,584
But once they arrive here, they realize that...

613
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:28,042
...they don't yet have the skills
to do their job well.

614
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,792
So for $200, you can help them out.

615
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:32,792
This is what you

616
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,751
call helping those in need...

617
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,459
...to learn valuable skills in life.

618
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:42,792
I mean, $200 is nothing to you, right?

619
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:45,292
Fine, fine, I'll have one.

620
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:49,251
I'm so touched! I'm so grateful to all of you.

621
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:52,542
So, shall we get ready?

622
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:54,459
The 4 trainees, stand by.

623
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:58,792
Sit back for a bit, ok? See you shortly!

624
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,959
Now let's tie up some loose ends.
You sure you don't want this?

625
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:03,584
If you don't, then I'll take it.

626
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:08,251
Hold it, hold it. Two drops only!

627
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:14,501
First, I want to explain to
you the upcoming procedures.

628
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:17,459
You take care of the front;
you help push with your boobs.

629
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,126
After showering, both of you

630
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,334
then come at me together. Understand?

631
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,626
Sounds good! I'll go strip.

632
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,792
Go, go. How long have you been a trainee?

633
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:34,501
Get you fucking clothes back on!

634
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,542
What's wrong? Aren't we doing the boob push?

635
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:37,709
Boob push needs boobs to be able to push!

636
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:41,126
You're all bones. You're lying!
You're probably not even from Dalian!

637
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:42,667
But I'm really from Dalian!

638
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,584
But you just conned me into believing you
have a big rack!

639
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:48,376
You'd get arrested if you were in Hong Kong.

640
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:49,917
Get me the mama-san!

641
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:59,542
Hurry up! Come on in, you hunk! Sit down!

642
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:03,209
- Is this your first time?
- Mmm.

643
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:07,251
Wow, you have really big feet!

644
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:10,542
You know what they say,
big feet means other parts are big too.

645
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:11,584
<i>Mmm.</i>

646
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:14,542
Hey sister, bring the stuff over here.

647
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,876
Oh, you're so nervous!

648
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:22,084
Please have some tea.

649
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:23,834
Thank you.

650
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:25,417
That's not for him to drink.

651
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:27,251
It's for me to use later on.

652
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:31,834
Have some candy then?

653
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:33,709
That's not for him either!

654
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:36,667
I'm going to use it on him later.

655
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,459
Hey, it's cold, why don't you wear something.

656
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,417
Corning, boss!

657
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,126
Hey,hey,hey!

658
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:49,084
- What are you doing?
- I'll do it myself.

659
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:51,126
You're cheeky!

660
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:53,417
Hey,hey,hey!

661
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:54,459
I like it!

662
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:57,709
Thank you! But just massage is ok,
no need to fondle.

663
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,376
You're so sensitive!

664
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:03,251
Hey...don't move, don't move!

665
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,751
I just want massage, nothing else.

666
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:06,792
Good idea!

667
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,959
- Good evening boss!
- Let me help you.

668
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,209
Good!

669
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:13,792
Boss, I'll start stripping then.

670
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,417
No complaints from me!

671
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:21,626
Wow, I didn't expect that you not only
have a small mouth...

672
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,459
...but also a small rack!

673
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,167
What's your name?

674
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:29,834
I'm Ling Ling.

675
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:32,001
Ling Ling good name!

676
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,167
Why is a beauty such as yourself

677
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:37,251
working here at a brothel?

678
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:39,501
It's because I'm new
and don't have much experience.

679
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:42,959
Exactly, you're just lacking some experience.

680
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:45,501
But here's your chance.

681
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:47,501
Why don't you gulp down some tea first?

682
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,001
Boss, I can't do it.

683
00:33:49,209 --> 00:33:51,167
It's company policy we can only fondle...

684
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:52,751
...but no mouth.

685
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:56,667
I understand that it's a big company,
and rules cannot be broken.

686
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,834
That much is certain.

687
00:33:58,001 --> 00:33:59,126
Boss, you're such a good person!

688
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,001
Yes, I'm a very good person.

689
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:03,751
The other clients

690
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,834
wouldn't think about your future...

691
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,126
...so they would never help you.

692
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,251
But I think we share a similar fate...

693
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:13,417
...so I will help you.

694
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,542
Boss!

695
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,584
Sorry for the misunderstanding...

696
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:23,209
You're full of shit!

697
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:25,876
You give me fakes and expect me to take it?

698
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:28,376
You waste my time and spoil my mood as well!
What now?

699
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:29,876
It's a misunderstanding.

700
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,959
I'll get you another and promise
that the next one will be a home run!

701
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:34,167
Hurry!

702
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,459
Come in!

703
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,126
Boss!

704
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:43,709
Wait, let's check the goods first.
Stand over there.

705
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,126
Sure, no problem.

706
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,501
Jump up and down 1O times.

707
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,542
See? This is what you call the real deal.

708
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:55,876
No way!

709
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:59,042
She's got fake ones too!
Why choose her and not me?

710
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:02,251
Because at least with her it's injected
inside her boobs...

711
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:06,834
...unlike yours which is
falling out everywhere! Go home!

712
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:09,917
Hey handsome, do you want to shower first?

713
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:11,417
No need.

714
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,584
Then I'll take one!

715
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:15,834
Wait a sec.

716
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:19,376
Do you need to use the mouth wash?

717
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,667
This stuff is all for her use later.

718
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:25,209
Oh.

719
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:35,876
Had dinner yet?

720
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,126
Yes.You?

721
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:39,459
Me too.

722
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:42,376
You just joined?

723
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:44,126
A few days ago.

724
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:47,084
Have you gone out and looked around yet?

725
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:49,334
Not yet.

726
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,126
But want to go see the ruins of St. Paul's.

727
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:55,042
The ruins of St. Paul. Nice place.

728
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:02,792
Have a candy.

729
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,584
Do you want me to do massage first?

730
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:30,792
Let's finish this first.

731
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,376
Hey, hey! What are you doing?!

732
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:04,834
What do you mean? This is normal.

733
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:06,542
I'm famous for my magic hands...

734
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:08,417
...and my special massage.

735
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:10,334
There's really no need.

736
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,959
I don't need a "happy ending".

737
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:14,376
Just a normal massage, okay?

738
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:16,626
You're so thoughtful! Alright.

739
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:18,334
- Thank you!
- Come on!

740
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:24,042
Company policy says you can't suck, right?

741
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:29,376
But you can instead use your mouth to "fondle".

742
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:32,209
That won't break the company policy...

743
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,209
...surely?

744
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:46,334
Oh ouch, ouch!

745
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:48,667
Boss, sorry, are you okay?

746
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:49,834
Shit, that really hurts!

747
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:57,709
You give me back my own pubic hair?

748
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:02,167
Hey good-looking, did you wait long?

749
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:03,834
Hurry and get undressed!

750
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,251
You need a massage?

751
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:21,417
Sister, sit over there.

752
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:32,917
Do you need a massage?

753
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:37,959
No thanks.

754
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,417
What does this mean?

755
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:46,584
It's a normal random police check.

756
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:49,459
Just show your ID to the officer

757
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:50,917
you don't even need to leave.

758
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:52,667
Oh Shit!

759
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,792
Boss, I can't! Just now you already went way
over the line.

760
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,292
Hey, just let me taste it once.

761
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,667
- I cannot!
- Boss, phone call.

762
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:04,251
Yes?

763
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,126
Dried Shrimp!

764
00:39:06,292 --> 00:39:10,667
There's no Mainland police officers here,
just Macau ones. They don't arrest clients.

765
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:13,001
I cannot...

766
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,167
A bit, just a bit.

767
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:15,334
- I really cannot!
- Just a touch?

768
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:17,542
Boss, your phone!

769
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:22,667
- What now?
- Keung, we really need to leave now!

770
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:26,792
I told you, they are not here to arrest clients...

771
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,667
...they just check IDs.

772
00:39:28,876 --> 00:39:30,584
Exactly they check IDs!

773
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:32,709
Oh Shit!

774
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:35,251
You call Josh, and I call Ka Ho.
We leave in 1 minute!

775
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:40,084
Bloody hell, what oil did you use? Is it expired?

776
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,001
No, I just opened it...

777
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:47,626
What the fuck?! You can't even tell
the difference between water and oil?

778
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:49,709
- And you call yourself a massage therapist?
- Sorry...

779
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:56,334
What's up?

780
00:39:58,126 --> 00:40:00,709
Captain, what's going on?

781
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:03,376
Police check! Be outside in 45 seconds.

782
00:40:03,876 --> 00:40:05,209
No fucking way!

783
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,917
- Here's some tips.
- Thank you sir.

784
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:13,709
Thank you.

785
00:40:13,876 --> 00:40:15,042
What's your name?

786
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:16,167
I'm Lily.

787
00:40:16,334 --> 00:40:18,209
Lily, bye.

788
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,167
Everything's fine.

789
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,334
Enjoy. enjoy!

790
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:50,584
Hey boss, the police check is nearly finished.
You can have more fun soon.

791
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:51,292
Go,go,go!

792
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:53,751
YOU, stop!

793
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:29,251
It's a dead end!

794
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:31,251
- Here, this way!
- What?!

795
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,751
They're coming! Don't think, just jump!

796
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:34,751
Ahhhh!

797
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,376
Yahhhh!

798
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:37,917
Yahhhh!

799
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:41,459
- Jump!

800
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,792
I can't, my legs are like jelly
and my dick is hard!

801
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,501
Normally you can do it, so just go for it!

802
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:49,876
Quick! They're here, quick!

803
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:51,251
Hurry!

804
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:54,167
You guys go. Just leave me!

805
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:55,501
Then let's go.

806
00:41:56,459 --> 00:41:58,501
Let's run first, then think of a way
to rescue him.

807
00:41:58,667 --> 00:41:59,292
No!

808
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:03,417
We came together as a team,
we'll leave together as a team!

809
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:04,792
If you move, I'll shoot!

810
00:42:06,751 --> 00:42:09,501
Stop, don't move!

811
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:12,334
Run! Don't worry about me!

812
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:14,084
Hands UP!

813
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:22,376
Wow, the station is packed today!

814
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,417
The four of you, get in there.

815
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:32,334
Thank you sir.

816
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,042
Shall we call a doctor?

817
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:35,459
No need.

818
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:39,376
Please take out your wallets, keys, mobile phones.
Everything in your pockets.

819
00:42:39,876 --> 00:42:40,959
- Hey, let's go!
- What's the matter?

820
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:42,959
Beckham is injured!
You can do this later let's go now!

821
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:44,292
You guys stay put!

822
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:50,709
I told you Beckham will leave the field.

823
00:42:51,334 --> 00:42:53,167
There's still Rooney that's enough.

824
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:56,042
Can one guy like Rooney save the whole team?

825
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:59,084
I don't know if one person can
save the team or not...

826
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:03,376
...but now I know one person
can harm the whole team.

827
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,542
Why do you keep on groaning?

828
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,209
No...the thing is so stiff, it's painful.

829
00:43:10,376 --> 00:43:12,417
I told you two drops only!
You had to be greedy...

830
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:13,792
It wasn't me!

831
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:16,084
The chick didn't know
and used half the bottle!

832
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:19,001
Fine, fine! Why don't you turn around
and sort yourself out?

833
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:20,792
Can you be quiet afterwards?

834
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:23,542
Don't look, guys!

835
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:24,917
Fuck!

836
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,042
I told you we shouldn't have come.

837
00:43:31,084 --> 00:43:32,167
Look at what's happened!

838
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,167
Even the name of the operation is stupid.

839
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:36,209
What the fuck is your problem, huh?

840
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:41,001
Huh? We all decided to come together...

841
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:43,917
...but now you're fucking blaming me?

842
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,251
You forced me!

843
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:53,209
I forced you? If you weren't horny as well...

844
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:55,751
...how in the world would I force you?

845
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:58,459
This "Sex War" operation was
agreed upon by everyone.

846
00:43:58,792 --> 00:43:59,959
Where's your sense of shared responsibility?

847
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:01,626
You shouldn't even be in the SDU!

848
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,876
Now you're talking about the SDU?

849
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:06,959
Do you know how many rules we broke tonight?

850
00:44:07,126 --> 00:44:07,959
This "Sex War" operation...

851
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:08,876
- I'm the commander of this operation!
- We left Hong Kong

852
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:10,251
- without approval...
- I didn't say

853
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,084
this operation has failed,

854
00:44:11,251 --> 00:44:12,126
- so it will continue!
- ...Illegally entered Macau...

855
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:13,292
- This is an order!
- ...hired prostitutes, resisted arrests.

856
00:44:13,459 --> 00:44:14,209
- I'm the commander of this operation!
- Any one of

857
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:16,501
- these could get us fired!
- Are you challenging me?

858
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:19,834
Keung, let's forget it...

859
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:22,376
You finish your jerking off!
None of your business!

860
00:44:22,876 --> 00:44:23,459
Come on...

861
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:25,959
This fucking bastard has looked down
on me for a long time!

862
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:28,709
You want to transfer to another team?

863
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,542
We're harming your career, right?

864
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:33,376
I'm not a good enough leader for you, is that it?

865
00:44:39,126 --> 00:44:45,084
You're the leader, right? Let me ask you this.
What should we do now?

866
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:48,167
Shall we go out there and tell them we're all SDU?

867
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,417
Let the papers put us on the front page?

868
00:44:49,626 --> 00:44:52,501
SDU members going to Macau to look for hookers?

869
00:44:56,792 --> 00:45:00,834
As the leader of the B-team
and "Sex War" operation commander...

870
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:04,501
...after assessing our current situation,
I have reached a conclusion.

871
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:05,709
Our best move is to...

872
00:45:08,501 --> 00:45:09,501
escape!

873
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,251
You mean altogether?

874
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:13,876
Because I heard "everybody"

875
00:45:14,042 --> 00:45:17,126
I totally agree with you, but how?

876
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:31,167
Got any small change?

877
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:03,209
Hold on.

878
00:46:03,376 --> 00:46:05,751
Go, go, go...Come on...
Come on...Oh crap!

879
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:07,251
Trying an overhead kick?

880
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:13,792
OK, back to business.

881
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:16,042
Hey, let's finish the second half first.

882
00:46:16,209 --> 00:46:17,542
Nah, you guys carry on.

883
00:46:19,626 --> 00:46:21,584
Oh shit! The suspects escaped!

884
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:26,876
They took this all down?

885
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:31,584
Hello? Sir...

886
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:36,667
sorry...the four suspects got away.

887
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:41,042
What were you doing? You didn't cuff them
and didn't put them in a cell?

888
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:42,792
The cell is already full, sir.

889
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,834
Three days ago, we received
classified information.

890
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:49,417
Wang Tao brought more men

891
00:46:49,584 --> 00:46:52,042
to Hong Kong via Macau.

892
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,959
From the method they used in their escape...

893
00:46:54,126 --> 00:46:55,667
...we believe your four men

894
00:46:55,834 --> 00:46:58,417
may be part of Wang Tao's gang.

895
00:46:58,709 --> 00:47:00,251
Everyone get ready for a briefing in 10 minutes.

896
00:47:00,626 --> 00:47:03,501
We must arrest them! Understand?

897
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:05,126
Yes sir!

898
00:47:11,334 --> 00:47:12,292
Shit!

899
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:15,459
Give them a call. Tell them
to turn around we'll pay them extra!

900
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,501
- I don't have the phone on me.
- What?!

901
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:18,792
It's in my trousers.

902
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:35,959
Hey guys, heading back to Hong Kong?

903
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:38,292
- You want to leave right now?
- Yes, now!

904
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:39,542
$2000 each. We leave now.

905
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:40,751
Give it to him.

906
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:43,501
My money is in the trousers too.

907
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:44,792
What?!

908
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:47,334
If you don't have the money, don't waste my time!

909
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:48,917
No no...here, take my watch!

910
00:47:49,084 --> 00:47:49,917
I'll withdraw money
from the ATM once we land.

911
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:51,917
I don't have time for this nonsense. Assholes.

912
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:57,626
Go back and get your trousers.

913
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,042
You must be kidding we just got out!
You have a death wish or something?

914
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:05,542
And you call yourself a cop? They just checked
the place why would they go back?

915
00:48:05,709 --> 00:48:07,126
Fine, whatever you say.

916
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:08,959
Give me 10 seconds.

917
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:30,209
What's going on?

918
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:32,209
Nothing. Shall we go?

919
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:36,709
Hurry up!

920
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:43,501
What?

921
00:48:48,209 --> 00:48:52,126
Fuck, the flat-chested girl stole all my money!
Get the mama-san, quick!

922
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:54,251
Why would I have the mama-saws number?

923
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:56,042
Oh Shit!

924
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:57,376
It's Lily.

925
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,334
It's a friend.

926
00:48:59,709 --> 00:49:01,376
Friend? What kind of friend?

927
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:04,126
She's the trainee in my room.
She can be trusted, it's okay.

928
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:06,751
Where's the flat-chested girl?
She stole all my money!

929
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:08,626
How would she know which flat-chested girl?

930
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:13,751
Police! Open the door! Police! Open the door!

931
00:49:14,334 --> 00:49:15,292
Coming!

932
00:49:18,376 --> 00:49:19,751
Have you seen any suspicious men around?

933
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,459
- Yes!
- Where?

934
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:24,334
While I was walking past,

935
00:49:24,501 --> 00:49:26,334
I saw 4 guys over there arguing...

936
00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:30,751
Oh, the sound proofing here isn't great.

937
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:33,126
They should be over there.
Why don't you have a look?

938
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:35,959
You'd better not be lying.
If we don't catch them, we'd have to punish you.

939
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:37,751
Sir, you're on duty.

940
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:40,459
Who's your mama-san? What's your name?

941
00:49:40,626 --> 00:49:42,292
I don't have one. I'm Nancy.

942
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:43,209
Nancy?

943
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:45,792
You can flirt later. Over there, right?

944
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:47,376
Thanks.

945
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:52,959
Thank you.

946
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:57,459
Thank you.

947
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,167
God, I'm in pain.

948
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:06,167
Hey! She's getting changed, don't look!

949
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:07,959
- I'm not looking.
- Yup!

950
00:50:08,126 --> 00:50:10,334
Turn around, for fuck's sake!

951
00:50:12,834 --> 00:50:13,834
Ow!

952
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:16,376
Where are you guys going?

953
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:21,001
I'll leave you guys here...

954
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:23,334
Please be careful.

955
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,001
Thanks a lot. Let's go!

956
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:28,167
Hey, you'd better take this with you.

957
00:50:28,334 --> 00:50:29,084
No way, that's your money.

958
00:50:29,251 --> 00:50:30,209
You'll need it for the taxi.

959
00:50:30,334 --> 00:50:34,209
Fine, I thank you on behalf of
Hong Kong residents. Let's go!

960
00:50:36,084 --> 00:50:37,626
- Hey, I really can't stand it anymore!
- Hurry up!

961
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:39,542
Can I find somewhere to relieve myself first?

962
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:47,459
Hold on, hold on! Almost there! Hold on!

963
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:49,501
- I'll go and sort this out now.
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

964
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:50,709
Oh!

965
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:56,501
Sex War operation commander, what do we do now?

966
00:50:59,376 --> 00:51:00,292
Let me think it over.

967
00:51:00,459 --> 00:51:03,126
Think it over? By then we'll all be arrested!

968
00:51:03,334 --> 00:51:04,834
I told you we shouldn't have come!

969
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:06,667
Why do you always have to be so negative?

970
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:09,042
When I was a kid, I watched those SDU movies,
and they had a saying:

971
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:12,501
Confidence does not make you a winner.
But with no confidence.

972
00:51:13,126 --> 00:51:16,001
I believe in our captain,

973
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,584
and I believe in our "Sex War" operation!

974
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:20,167
We still can get out of this mess!

975
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:21,584
That's right

976
00:51:22,334 --> 00:51:25,292
True, although we didn't get to sleep
with the girls...

977
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:29,376
...at least we fondled them!
That's better than nothing.

978
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:33,126
Fuck it! So now what?

979
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:35,001
I'll tell you after I take a piss.

980
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:39,917
Of course you say you want to come!

981
00:51:40,084 --> 00:51:41,084
Dried Shrimp!

982
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:42,917
What?!

983
00:51:43,084 --> 00:51:44,084
What were you doing just now?

984
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:44,917
Nothing.

985
00:51:45,084 --> 00:51:46,042
- Nothing?
- What now?

986
00:51:46,209 --> 00:51:47,209
What are you hiding there?

987
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:47,959
Nothing!

988
00:51:48,126 --> 00:51:49,167
Take it out.

989
00:51:49,334 --> 00:51:51,042
- Take it out now.
- You go outside first!

990
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:54,376
Come out! Take it out!

991
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:08,251
"Thai Style massage"

992
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:11,792
You were using this to jerk off?

993
00:52:12,084 --> 00:52:12,584
<i>L.</i>

994
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:14,292
I'm asking you...

995
00:52:14,584 --> 00:52:17,584
...why were you jerking off to
an ad for male hustlers?

996
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:22,626
I'm actually gay.

997
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:28,001
You're gay and you came here for prostitutes?
What a waste of money!

998
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:31,042
I wanted to tell you guys earlier.

999
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,959
But I was worried that you guys
wouldn't accept me.

1000
00:52:33,126 --> 00:52:34,626
We're a team

1001
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:38,084
why wouldn't we accept you? Right?

1002
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:39,251
Yes!

1003
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:40,292
Yup!

1004
00:52:40,459 --> 00:52:41,626
I was scared to come out...

1005
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,542
...since everyone thinks SDUs are so manly.

1006
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:46,959
I was worried that if I didn't
come with you guys...

1007
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:48,709
...you'd look down on me.

1008
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:50,417
Why would we look down on you?

1009
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,334
Which century are we in now?

1010
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:54,459
You ask Josh

1011
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:56,959
this kind of thing is normal
in other countries, right?

1012
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:02,459
It's no big deal. It's pretty normal in Boston.

1013
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:04,834
It's a screw-or-be-screwed world anyhow.

1014
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:07,001
Exactly, why would we treat you any differently?

1015
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,501
You really won't?

1016
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,042
Of course we won't!

1017
00:53:11,001 --> 00:53:12,167
But if we shower together,

1018
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:13,334
I will pick up my own soap!

1019
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:15,542
A lot of people think like you.
That's why they invented liquid soap.

1020
00:53:15,709 --> 00:53:16,251
I use them!

1021
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:17,626
You're so smart!

1022
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:19,334
You bastards!

1023
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:23,376
I wouldn't do that I'd just stick
close to the wall.

1024
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:24,626
I'm gay.

1025
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:25,917
But it doesn't mean I want to screw just any guy.

1026
00:53:26,084 --> 00:53:27,126
You guys don't need to freak out.

1027
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:29,834
We aren't freaking out.
We all treat you as a friend.

1028
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:31,584
But you can't bring your gay friends

1029
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,251
- over to bully us!
- Why not?

1030
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:34,584
Then we'd be the ones who are called shrimps!

1031
00:53:34,751 --> 00:53:35,792
Fucking hell.

1032
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:38,459
See, that's why I didn't want to tell you guys!

1033
00:53:38,876 --> 00:53:41,334
Just joking don't be like that!

1034
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:43,959
We'll get use to it soon!

1035
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:45,167
Come on!

1036
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:47,167
Ah, is Fei-Lung still at that bar drinking?

1037
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:52,917
Hey, I go this way, you go that way.

1038
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:54,042
OK.

1039
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:05,834
This is good stuff, and it's for you!

1040
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:07,376
Hey!

1041
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,126
You can apply it to your nose, or even the mouth!

1042
00:54:20,209 --> 00:54:22,001
Eh? Why are you here?

1043
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:25,709
Well, the trainee job pays too little,
so I need to find a second job.

1044
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:30,584
I see. By the way, do you know
any speedboat drivers?

1045
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:32,251
Those guys over there by the door should be.

1046
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:33,667
- Here?
- Yes

1047
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:36,709
OK, thanks.

1048
00:54:41,417 --> 00:54:42,251
What do you wanna drink?

1049
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:43,542
San Miguel.

1050
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:45,084
US$40

1051
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:51,292
Hey, you look familiar.
I think I've seen you on TV before.

1052
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:54,084
Would you happen to be referring to Tony Leung?

1053
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:55,542
No way!

1054
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,917
Breaking news,

1055
00:54:58,084 --> 00:55:00,084
around 1am this morning...

1056
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:02,501
...four male Chinese suspects escaped

1057
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:04,251
from the police station.

1058
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:05,626
According to police sources

1059
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:08,126
they are considered to be extremely dangerous.

1060
00:55:10,709 --> 00:55:11,751
Hey buddy.

1061
00:55:11,959 --> 00:55:13,792
4 people going back to Hong Kong tonight.
Will you take us?

1062
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:18,834
How? My boat has been detained by the police.
I can%leave!

1063
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:21,792
We'll pay you more if you agree.

1064
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:24,792
No really, I can't help you.

1065
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:32,084
Your hand is colder

1066
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:34,251
than the beer! Look! No, look!

1067
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,542
Your fucking mother is even colder! Go back
and fuck her instead!

1068
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,376
Wow, what the fuck?

1069
00:55:40,584 --> 00:55:41,917
Hey, where are you taking me?

1070
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:47,334
Oh, so no wonder the boss is always
praising your cheery attitude.

1071
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,542
So he means that you're happy. Like, gay happy.

1072
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:50,001
You understand, right?

1073
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,792
Don't get me wrong,
it's that you're gay I mean happy!

1074
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:53,834
- You still have to rub it in?
- Oh, sorry! Sorry!

1075
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,459
Hey, what are we doing?

1076
00:55:57,251 --> 00:55:58,626
Keep quiet.

1077
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:03,001
Breaking in is illegal!

1078
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:06,292
Police officers entering Macau for
hookers is already illegal.

1079
00:56:06,459 --> 00:56:07,667
Might as well go all the way.

1080
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:19,751
Hey, what are you looking for?

1081
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:23,084
Cash, of course! Hurry up and help!

1082
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:34,126
Burglars!

1083
00:56:34,292 --> 00:56:35,834
Where?

1084
00:56:37,376 --> 00:56:38,834
Huh? You know each other?

1085
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:40,459
- Ah ho? What you doing here?
- My friend's in trouble,

1086
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,251
so I came to get some cash.

1087
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:45,709
You're really something.
I've moved here for almost a year...

1088
00:56:46,209 --> 00:56:47,542
...and you didn't even visit me once.

1089
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:49,917
And on your first visit, you tried to rob us.

1090
00:56:50,209 --> 00:56:52,709
Kwan, call the police! We have burglars here!

1091
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,209
Come on, this is just a father-son argument.
No need to call the police.

1092
00:56:55,376 --> 00:56:55,959
Uncle, uncle...

1093
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:58,167
This ungrateful son of mine
deserves to be punished.

1094
00:56:58,542 --> 00:56:59,959
This ungrateful son of mine

1095
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:03,376
deserves to be punished.

1096
00:57:03,626 --> 00:57:05,542
I told you that we have an emergency,
otherwise I wouldn't need the cash!

1097
00:57:05,709 --> 00:57:07,001
Ungrateful bastard!

1098
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,709
Do you think I know nothing after I retired?

1099
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:11,667
I still have friends in the force!

1100
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:17,084
The money you owe outside is already on record
for internal investigation.

1101
00:57:17,251 --> 00:57:19,251
So what if you made it into the SDU?

1102
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:20,876
It's not like you're moving up any higher
in the ranks. You're useless!

1103
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:23,251
You like gambling so much,
you should feel sorry to your morn.

1104
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:24,709
I quit gambling a long time ago.

1105
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:25,667
So what? You still owe
few hundred thousand dollars!

1106
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:28,001
The money I owe is from the cafe business
I started with friends.

1107
00:57:29,834 --> 00:57:32,084
The force pays you well enough.

1108
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:35,417
You know nothing about the cafe business...

1109
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:38,167
...so of course you're losing money!
You don't even know how to fry an egg!

1110
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:40,334
Come on, you're both father and son.
Don't be angry, you can resolve this peacefully.

1111
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:44,084
What a stupid fool, loaning money
from loan sharks.

1112
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:46,251
Even if I ask loan sharks
and they don't lend me...

1113
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:47,792
...they still wouldn't treat me
like shit the way you do!

1114
00:57:48,584 --> 00:57:50,876
I started the cafe business for my own future.

1115
00:57:51,459 --> 00:57:52,459
I don't want to end up like you!

1116
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:54,084
- Like what?!
- You can't afford the rent

1117
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,126
in Hong Kong after retirement.

1118
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:56,834
So you have to move to Macau

1119
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:58,042
while your own money is running out!
What a failure.

1120
00:57:58,209 --> 00:57:59,084
How dare you call me a failure?!

1121
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:00,376
Put it down!

1122
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:01,876
Don't, he's your father!

1123
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:03,709
Uncle, let it go!

1124
00:58:03,876 --> 00:58:04,709
Call the police!

1125
00:58:06,709 --> 00:58:07,417
Hey!

1126
00:58:08,126 --> 00:58:09,709
- Are you okay, uncle?
- Call an ambulance!

1127
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:11,126
Look after him.

1128
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,667
Hey, how's it going?

1129
00:58:18,584 --> 00:58:20,126
Ka Ho's father is in the hospital.

1130
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:24,042
I thought you guys were trying to get money?
How did you end up here?

1131
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:28,001
It's a long story...Let's just say it
turned into a domestic drama.

1132
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:30,001
Where's Josh?

1133
00:58:30,626 --> 00:58:32,917
I lost him at the bar.
Tried calling him but no one answers.

1134
00:58:33,126 --> 00:58:34,376
Maybe he's dead?

1135
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:35,751
Where's Ka Ho?

1136
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:37,126
Over there.

1137
00:58:38,584 --> 00:58:40,876
He said he goes jogging and swimming...

1138
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:42,792
How could he end up like this?

1139
00:58:44,459 --> 00:58:46,292
You haven't visited in a while.

1140
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:50,084
Your father had an operation not long ago,

1141
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:52,792
but he wouldn't let us tell you.

1142
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:55,334
I do call him. He always say he's fine!

1143
00:58:56,376 --> 00:58:58,417
You owe people money and you didn't
tell him either!

1144
00:58:59,709 --> 00:59:01,167
You both are like two peas in a pod.

1145
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:07,292
I started the cafe business

1146
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:09,126
so I could make more money...

1147
00:59:09,501 --> 00:59:11,042
...was hoping to move him back to Hong Kong.

1148
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:16,667
I know he doesn't like living here.

1149
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,334
Aiya...Look at you.
You're a big boy now, don't cry.

1150
00:59:37,751 --> 00:59:39,334
You really think we moved here just

1151
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:41,209
because of the cheap rent?

1152
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:42,751
Dad also...

1153
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:45,376
Your father is a man too.

1154
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:47,126
Who here is the patient's family?

1155
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,209
The patient is fine, he just got too worked up.

1156
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:53,084
He should rest for a few days, then he'll be fine.

1157
00:59:53,251 --> 00:59:54,209
Thank you, doctor.

1158
01:00:02,334 --> 01:00:03,917
Let him rest.

1159
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:07,167
You guys head to Hak Sa.

1160
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:09,334
Plenty of speedboats back to Hong Kong there.

1161
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:11,084
- Thank you sir!
- Thanks uncle.

1162
01:00:11,251 --> 01:00:14,584
Hurry up if the report gets back to Hong Kong,
then you're in big trouble.

1163
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:15,417
Let's go.

1164
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:17,167
I just got the message. ls everything okay?

1165
01:00:18,126 --> 01:00:18,834
We understand.

1166
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:21,459
You were busy with the girl, so why would you have
time to answer your calls?

1167
01:00:23,084 --> 01:00:25,084
What are you talking about? She saved us before,

1168
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:26,334
and now she's in trouble.

1169
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:28,709
We understand. We don't have time, let's go.

1170
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:29,917
Already?

1171
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,042
Take care, uncle!

1172
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:33,417
We're leaving, bye bye!

1173
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:48,251
Hey, watch this!

1174
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:51,126
This one!

1175
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:00,209
Hurry up!

1176
01:01:00,959 --> 01:01:02,917
Wow, this is it! This is the place

1177
01:01:03,084 --> 01:01:04,959
that has the best crab congee!

1178
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,584
Boss, what would you like?

1179
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:14,459
- Crab congee for me.
- OK, crab congee!

1180
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:18,792
What's going on?

1181
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:21,459
Don't know just eat
and watch the unfolding drama!

1182
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:23,417
This dish is really famous here.

1183
01:01:23,584 --> 01:01:25,167
Why don't we share one?

1184
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:26,042
Sure.

1185
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:31,167
Huh?

1186
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:32,167
Why are you here?

1187
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:36,001
Ah, I didn't know you got knocked up.

1188
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:40,709
I normally hate kids, they're so much hassle.

1189
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:42,876
It's all his fault

1190
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:46,626
I thought we were being careful.

1191
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:50,001
But we did it once, then suddenly
I end up like this!

1192
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,667
Of course, I have good genes!
My sperms are active!

1193
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:55,126
Ewww, don't say dirty stuff like that!

1194
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:58,542
You sure did change quickly. Before,
you didn't like younger, more immature guys.

1195
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:00,209
He treats me very well.

1196
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:04,042
Sure he does, otherwise you wouldn't be
so quick to have his DNA inside you.

1197
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:04,959
Where's the ring?

1198
01:02:05,876 --> 01:02:08,209
I was thinking of us going on a holiday
together for our wedding.

1199
01:02:08,584 --> 01:02:11,626
Holidays are good. When?

1200
01:02:12,001 --> 01:02:15,167
No way!

1201
01:02:15,376 --> 01:02:16,542
He still isn't financially ready yet.

1202
01:02:16,709 --> 01:02:20,834
Better wait until he becomes the company's boss...

1203
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:23,667
...it's not too late.

1204
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:26,042
Good thinking. Good plan!

1205
01:02:28,876 --> 01:02:30,042
Why don't you leave me your number.

1206
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:32,292
Next time I'm in town I'll give you a call.

1207
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:34,292
Isn't he your friend?

1208
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,459
We're very good friends!
We even share the same ride.

1209
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:39,751
Since when do I share my ride with you?

1210
01:02:40,042 --> 01:02:42,167
Then why can't I get her number?

1211
01:02:42,334 --> 01:02:43,959
0h, I get m!

1212
01:02:44,084 --> 01:02:46,001
I should call you sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

1213
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,084
Hey, stop it.

1214
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:48,917
Then why not?

1215
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:54,417
Hey, why did they divorce?

1216
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:57,584
I don't know. He hardly talks about his wife.

1217
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:01,167
I just know they had an argument
then got divorced.

1218
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:03,417
Not surprising.

1219
01:03:03,584 --> 01:03:07,417
As SDUs, we have to wear protection
on every mission.

1220
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:09,626
But once you're at home in bed, you don't want
to wear protection anymore.

1221
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:13,417
So when she does, it leads to arguments
and then divorce.

1222
01:03:14,084 --> 01:03:15,167
Chan Siu-ching...

1223
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:16,209
...what game are you playing?

1224
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:17,959
Yes, I like playing games!

1225
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:20,417
Even when I give birth,

1226
01:03:20,584 --> 01:03:21,751
I wouldn't say that
I'm married on his birth certificate.

1227
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:24,084
I'm never giving up on your alimony money.

1228
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:26,126
The money I get from you now...

1229
01:03:26,292 --> 01:03:27,584
...I can even support

1230
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:29,917
another man.

1231
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:32,292
I wasted so much of my youth

1232
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:33,751
being with you...

1233
01:03:33,917 --> 01:03:35,542
...now it's time I

1234
01:03:35,876 --> 01:03:36,917
get my revenge.

1235
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:39,709
I provided everything for you
when you were with me!

1236
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:41,376
What rubbish is this about you
getting your "revenge"?

1237
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:45,167
You haven't changed one bit.

1238
01:03:45,334 --> 01:03:48,376
You forget that I'm not part of your "team".

1239
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:49,959
I don't need to follow your orders!

1240
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:53,042
And stop going to my mother's
and say that I cheated on you.

1241
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:55,209
We got divorced before I had someone else!

1242
01:03:55,376 --> 01:03:57,792
You're always just thinking about yourself!

1243
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,501
You don't take care of those around you.

1244
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:03,251
It's OK, it's OK. Don't be angry
with people like him.

1245
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:07,251
Let's eat.

1246
01:04:13,251 --> 01:04:14,667
Are we done? Then let's go.

1247
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:15,917
- Ummm.
- Finish it first. Eat!

1248
01:04:17,167 --> 01:04:19,417
Didn't you say you love crab congee?

1249
01:04:19,584 --> 01:04:20,834
So finish it!

1250
01:04:21,376 --> 01:04:23,667
Otherwise people will say I don't take care
of those around me.

1251
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:27,626
She didn't use to be like this.

1252
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:29,834
Actually, her chest is pretty much
the same as before.

1253
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,167
That's true.

1254
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,334
She used to be so easy-going.

1255
01:04:35,251 --> 01:04:39,292
I don't know when she started changing.
Maybe we were together for so long

1256
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,501
Every time we talk, we'd end up arguing.

1257
01:04:43,834 --> 01:04:46,167
Relationships between men
and women are never easy,

1258
01:04:46,334 --> 01:04:49,001
especially if you see each other every day.

1259
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:50,876
Not like his kind of people.

1260
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:53,584
And what's so different about us?

1261
01:04:53,876 --> 01:04:55,084
We have to do things face to face.

1262
01:04:55,376 --> 01:04:57,626
But not you guys. Since one of
you always flips over. there's less arguing.

1263
01:04:58,167 --> 01:04:59,417
Last joke! Last joke!

1264
01:04:59,626 --> 01:05:00,542
You deserve it.

1265
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,167
Keung, forget about it.

1266
01:05:06,459 --> 01:05:08,542
Just think of it as you donating to charity.

1267
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:12,959
That's right. A few thousand dollars
a month is not a lot.

1268
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:15,959
Captain!

1269
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:18,167
This is a matter of urgency we should sort out
this "Sex War" operation first...

1270
01:05:18,334 --> 01:05:19,376
...before getting sidetracked

1271
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:20,959
You're right.

1272
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:24,042
We're representing Hong Kong team,
this operation has to be good...

1273
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:25,959
Sex War operation must go on.

1274
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:27,376
Done yet?

1275
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:28,584
Let's go in 3O seconds.

1276
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:30,876
Yes, sir.

1277
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:32,042
That's crazy painful!

1278
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:33,584
We go to Bing Kee!

1279
01:05:36,292 --> 01:05:38,917
I know, smuggling iPads earn more than
smuggling milk powder.

1280
01:05:39,917 --> 01:05:42,667
But if all the kids drink tainted milk
and turn into mutants...

1281
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,876
...then who's left to buy your iPads?

1282
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:45,751
One ice coffee!

1283
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:48,376
OK, lets talk about this later.

1284
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:02,542
Hello my good man! How about a ride back
to Hong Kong?

1285
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:04,042
Call me Brother Eagle.

1286
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:08,709
I can usually detect the presence of cops.

1287
01:06:09,084 --> 01:06:10,459
Is this a bait-and-hook operation?

1288
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,084
Maybe you think I'm a cop...

1289
01:06:13,251 --> 01:06:15,709
...because I watched too many cop movies
when I was younger.

1290
01:06:15,959 --> 01:06:19,292
We just came over for some sightseeing.

1291
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:24,209
I'm just asking. You can't take me to court...

1292
01:06:24,376 --> 01:06:27,167
...if this is a trap I know my rights!

1293
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:29,459
Wow, Brother Eagle is a very learned man!

1294
01:06:29,709 --> 01:06:32,126
Hah, I also watch a lot of cop movies.
How many of you are there?

1295
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:33,376
Four.

1296
01:06:33,584 --> 01:06:34,959
$8,800, paid upfront.

1297
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:36,709
We only paid $4000 to come over!

1298
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:39,876
It's riskier now. Take it or leave it.

1299
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:48,792
Here's $4000.
I'll give you the rest when we board.

1300
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:51,501
Come back tonight.

1301
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:52,792
What?

1302
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:54,417
That's ages from now!

1303
01:06:54,584 --> 01:06:56,792
It's daytime now.

1304
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:58,251
Who is stupid enough to smuggle
during broad daylight?

1305
01:06:58,417 --> 01:06:59,334
Give me your phone!

1306
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:03,917
OK, it's done call me when you get here.

1307
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:11,334
1' 2:

1308
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:14,417
You said you didn't know how to play!

1309
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:16,584
Don't blame me it's only
because you're bad at it!

1310
01:07:16,751 --> 01:07:20,001
I was just making you happy by letting you win.

1311
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:26,001
I gotta go.

1312
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:27,751
To where?

1313
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:30,084
My friend found me a job,
so I need to go to an interview.

1314
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:33,709
Umm...

1315
01:07:36,709 --> 01:07:37,792
Goodbye.

1316
01:07:38,709 --> 01:07:39,709
See you.

1317
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:42,876
Why did you say "See you"?

1318
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:45,001
Don't you guys usually say "Bye bye"?

1319
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:48,042
It's because I think I'll see you again,
so I said "See you".

1320
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:57,792
Well?

1321
01:08:00,834 --> 01:08:01,334
How was it?

1322
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:02,876
Done. We leave when night falls.

1323
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:04,209
Where's your girl?

1324
01:08:04,376 --> 01:08:05,542
She had to leave.

1325
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:07,251
Dried shrimp?

1326
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:08,876
Jerking off again.

1327
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:10,667
Dried shrimp!

1328
01:08:13,584 --> 01:08:15,167
Are you OK? Seems like you're still struggling.

1329
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:16,834
Yeah, my hands are crazy tired!

1330
01:08:17,251 --> 01:08:18,376
Looks like I need to help you.

1331
01:08:19,376 --> 01:08:20,709
Thanks Keung.

1332
01:08:21,042 --> 01:08:23,001
But can you do it gently? It's a bit raw now.

1333
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:24,667
Ow!

1334
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,917
That's not what I mean! Follow me!

1335
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:40,001
Captain, you pawned off your Tudor watch?

1336
01:08:40,209 --> 01:08:41,417
But it was from your ex-wife!

1337
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,709
Exactly, so why keep it around?

1338
01:08:44,251 --> 01:08:45,251
Dried Shrimp.

1339
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,501
Captain, you should save this money
for your own use instead.

1340
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:56,126
We're a team, and we've decided you need

1341
01:08:56,376 --> 01:08:58,251
it the most right now.

1342
01:08:58,542 --> 01:08:59,751
Instead of us three having fun,

1343
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:01,209
why don't you have yours?

1344
01:09:01,376 --> 01:09:02,584
That's right.

1345
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:05,501
If this "Sex War" operation only allows one person
to spill their load...

1346
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:06,959
...then I think that person should be you.

1347
01:09:11,126 --> 01:09:12,209
Thank you Captain!

1348
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:13,459
Thank you Ka Ho!

1349
01:09:13,751 --> 01:09:15,626
You can thank me, but move back!

1350
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:17,376
I can feel you poking into me!

1351
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:18,917
Sorry Sorry Sorry!

1352
01:09:19,459 --> 01:09:21,584
Let's find a way to find him
a male prostitute in this place.

1353
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:26,542
"Thai Style massage"

1354
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,917
"Thai Restaurant"

1355
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:38,751
Keung, I'll pay you back
when we get back to Hong Kong.

1356
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:40,084
Then you can get your watch back!

1357
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,376
How can we ask you for the watch money back?

1358
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:44,834
You know it's better to give than to receive...

1359
01:09:45,001 --> 01:09:46,459
...Because if we receive it would mean
we're on the ones getting cornholed!

1360
01:09:46,626 --> 01:09:47,334
Hey!

1361
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:49,667
So sorry, that was really the last joke!

1362
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:51,501
Don't be a sissy...

1363
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:53,501
...hurry up and go inside!
We'll wait for you downstairs.

1364
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:56,167
Can you come in with me?

1365
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:57,792
I'm really nervous!

1366
01:09:57,959 --> 01:09:59,792
I've never been to places like this before.

1367
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,501
- So we do the fucking for you too?
- Hey, just forget about it...

1368
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:06,167
Sawasdee-ka! Hello handsomes,
are you looking for Thai delicacies?

1369
01:10:06,334 --> 01:10:09,542
The three of us are not, but he is.
We are his bodyguards.

1370
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,876
Wow, Mr. Bodyguard, you have such a big chest!

1371
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:16,084
Do you want to do part-time here?

1372
01:10:16,501 --> 01:10:18,126
Aren't there just Thai delicacies here?

1373
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:24,501
Thai food can also be adapted for Chinese
or Western tastes! So are you interested?

1374
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:27,709
I may be fit, but I can't handle it
when people pressure me.

1375
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:33,626
So...do you have any preferences?

1376
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:36,084
Don't underestimate him, he can handle it all!

1377
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:39,292
Wow...Thai happy ending, priced $6969!

1378
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:41,459
Zesty young meat!

1379
01:10:43,834 --> 01:10:45,917
So? Decided yet?

1380
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:47,042
I don't know what to choose.

1381
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,709
Too many choices confuse you let me help.

1382
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:54,417
Try this one: Spicy Royal Rack!

1383
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:55,501
Hey this one's OK!

1384
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,292
Mama-san, this one please!

1385
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:58,501
- No problem.
- Hold on.

1386
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:02,751
The pictures are always different
from the real thing.

1387
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:03,917
- Let's have a look first!
- No problem,

1388
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,417
I'll put the order through right now!

1389
01:11:07,501 --> 01:11:08,501
Sawasdee-krub!

1390
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:13,001
What? You call this Spicy Royal Rack?

1391
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,459
It's more like Spicy Royal Fat!

1392
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,251
You shouldn't judge by looks alone...

1393
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:21,376
...service is more important in the end, right?

1394
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:23,876
For fuck's sake, with all that fat...

1395
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:25,376
...you'd sooner die of high cholesterol
after trying him!

1396
01:11:25,751 --> 01:11:27,876
Usually the ones with some fat are tastier!

1397
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:30,459
Forget it, let's not argue.
Just bring us another one, OK?

1398
01:11:30,917 --> 01:11:32,084
This one?

1399
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:33,209
OK.

1400
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:35,251
Hot and sour tender mix!

1401
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:36,751
Coming!

1402
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:38,626
Hi Baby!

1403
01:11:39,126 --> 01:11:40,501
Exactly what kind of mix is this?

1404
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:41,751
A mix of northern and southern India.

1405
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:44,167
I usually don't discriminate, but...

1406
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:47,042
- ...I'm afraid of the dark.
- But the dark ones have the most experience!

1407
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:51,501
You know he is the best in getting people off?

1408
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:53,542
The god of prostate massage!

1409
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:58,209
Guaranteed instant erection!

1410
01:11:58,376 --> 01:12:00,876
Don't worry about that, he's already up for it.

1411
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:03,709
Seriously, no more fooling around.

1412
01:12:04,251 --> 01:12:06,709
This is the last chance. This one!
Thai-styled roast beef.

1413
01:12:07,709 --> 01:12:08,834
Thai-styled roast beef.

1414
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,042
Hahaha“.

1415
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:13,459
This is our other special.

1416
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,084
Was gonna save him for myself tonight...

1417
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:20,501
But seeing that you like quality,
I'll let you guys have him!

1418
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:21,876
Let's have a look first.

1419
01:12:22,917 --> 01:12:23,959
Sawasdee-krub!

1420
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:30,751
Wow!

1421
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:34,167
No need to look like you're starving for it.

1422
01:12:34,834 --> 01:12:36,084
Like what?

1423
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:37,667
You already look like you're sucking him off!

1424
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:38,834
Fuck you!

1425
01:12:42,334 --> 01:12:43,667
Go take good care of our guest!

1426
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:45,667
Yes sir!

1427
01:12:46,001 --> 01:12:47,084
He'll get milked dry!

1428
01:12:50,917 --> 01:12:52,084
There's the saying "the ball is round",

1429
01:12:52,251 --> 01:12:53,959
This year another surprise.

1430
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:55,376
Portugal beats England on penalties

1431
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,251
3-1 and progresses to the semi-finals.

1432
01:12:58,459 --> 01:13:01,251
I told you, football is not a one-man game.

1433
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:04,417
In the end it's all about the strategy.

1434
01:13:04,584 --> 01:13:09,459
Got the $2000 that you owe me?

1435
01:13:10,584 --> 01:13:11,751
How would I have it?

1436
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:13,667
Hey, have you guys finished arguing?
We lost the game already.

1437
01:13:15,001 --> 01:13:16,334
The flat-chest bitch?

1438
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:19,209
You bitch, you stole my money to come here?

1439
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:20,167
Where's my money?

1440
01:13:20,334 --> 01:13:21,626
What are you doing! Let me go!

1441
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:22,834
Where's my money?

1442
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:25,001
I don't even have enough money
to buy make-up yesterday!

1443
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:25,876
And my mobile?

1444
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:27,501
I dropped it.

1445
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:30,209
- You dropped it? Fuck you!
- What are you doing?!

1446
01:13:31,084 --> 01:13:32,876
What is this then? You dropped it?

1447
01:13:33,251 --> 01:13:34,459
Why are you guys here?

1448
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:38,501
Oh, nothing, waiting for the boat and my friends.

1449
01:13:38,667 --> 01:13:40,626
Why? You came here to fool around?

1450
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:42,209
No!

1451
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:43,709
Did you find speedboat?

1452
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:45,584
- Found him.
- Wait a second...

1453
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:47,542
...is the Big Fei-Lung you're talking

1454
01:13:47,709 --> 01:13:48,709
about the one who looks like...

1455
01:13:48,876 --> 01:13:50,042
Anthony Wong?

1456
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:51,501
More like Simon Loui.

1457
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:54,959
Why didn't you talk to him when you saw him?

1458
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:56,292
When did I see him?

1459
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:58,251
I said hi to you last night...

1460
01:13:58,584 --> 01:14:00,251
...but you turned around as soon as you saw us.

1461
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:01,417
What are you talking about?

1462
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:03,001
The place was so dark did you get
the wrong person?

1463
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:06,167
I didn't even say where, how did you
know it was dark?

1464
01:14:06,334 --> 01:14:07,376
Josh, what is up with you?

1465
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:09,417
Talk!

1466
01:14:09,584 --> 01:14:11,501
Big Fei-Lung isn't the only one with a boat!

1467
01:14:11,876 --> 01:14:12,667
We have one now, right?

1468
01:14:12,834 --> 01:14:14,542
No, I want to know why you saw him

1469
01:14:14,709 --> 01:14:15,792
but didn't say anything!

1470
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:16,709
How can I?

1471
01:14:16,876 --> 01:14:18,834
I arrested him before!

1472
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,209
So how should I go over and say hi to his face?

1473
01:14:20,376 --> 01:14:21,626
Bullshit!

1474
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:24,751
He's driving a speedboat now so what if
he knows you're a police?

1475
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:26,542
As if he'd go and report you.

1476
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:28,084
I didn't just arrest him.

1477
01:14:29,084 --> 01:14:30,542
I framed him too!

1478
01:14:30,959 --> 01:14:31,959
Serious?

1479
01:14:32,126 --> 01:14:36,376
You're always so righteous
you'd do such a thing?

1480
01:14:37,876 --> 01:14:40,251
I've always wanted to become a part of SDU.

1481
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:45,667
So back then, I wanted to prove myself

1482
01:14:46,334 --> 01:14:47,917
in front of my seniors.

1483
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:53,001
Big Fei-Lung was still dealing drugs at the time.

1484
01:14:54,334 --> 01:14:58,626
I went to a disco and saw him,

1485
01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:00,792
but didn't find anything on him.

1486
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,667
So I planted some drugs

1487
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:10,709
which I found earlier in his car's backseat.

1488
01:15:11,834 --> 01:15:15,167
No wonder you wanted to sit in the back
when we came over! Just checking, right?

1489
01:15:15,334 --> 01:15:18,209
I always think back on this and regret it.

1490
01:15:18,376 --> 01:15:19,959
I always wanted to be a good policeman,

1491
01:15:20,126 --> 01:15:21,917
a good SDU...

1492
01:15:22,334 --> 01:15:24,501
...but this is always at the back of my head.

1493
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:27,501
When I saw Big Fei-Lung, I was scared shitless.

1494
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,501
I wasn't afraid of him calling me out.

1495
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:33,667
I was scared of him looking at me.

1496
01:15:34,126 --> 01:15:35,626
Do you understand?

1497
01:15:39,084 --> 01:15:43,251
Once you're a cop for a while,
you're bound to have a few regrets along the way.

1498
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,209
It's OK, if you cannot face up to others...

1499
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:47,542
...as long as you can still face up to yourself.

1500
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:52,584
I used to look down on other people...

1501
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:56,126
...but then I realise that everyone
is about the same.

1502
01:15:57,209 --> 01:16:01,042
You can't say that I'm not like you...

1503
01:16:01,209 --> 01:16:03,876
...I'm not from Boston!

1504
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:06,001
And I don't know how to say "nipples"!

1505
01:16:06,626 --> 01:16:08,126
We just call it "lin"!

1506
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:10,167
Oh yeah, where's your flat-chest bitch?

1507
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:14,042
Fuck, she got away again!

1508
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:17,042
Next time, I'll burst her boobs!

1509
01:16:17,209 --> 01:16:19,334
How can you burst someone with no boobs?

1510
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:20,834
I'll squeeze it!

1511
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:24,376
What's with the wind suddenly?

1512
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:25,709
Is it from a hairdryer?

1513
01:16:33,042 --> 01:16:35,251
Wow, you look like you're glowing!

1514
01:16:35,417 --> 01:16:37,126
Was the sucking and blowing good?

1515
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:41,251
I just know one thing: all's right with the world.

1516
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:42,084
Congrats!

1517
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:47,751
Good, "Sex War"

1518
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:50,084
operation is complete,
with Dried Shrimp as our rep!

1519
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:52,417
It's about time let's go!

1520
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:53,751
Go!

1521
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:54,917
MY legs are wobbly!

1522
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:13,042
How are you? You only just came,
but you're hard again?!

1523
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:15,001
That medicine is really strong!

1524
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:18,542
I didn't mean it to happen.

1525
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:21,792
You guys head in first,
I'll find somewhere to sort this out.

1526
01:17:22,751 --> 01:17:24,334
Hurry up then.

1527
01:17:29,376 --> 01:17:30,626
- Fuck!
- There's no one!

1528
01:17:30,834 --> 01:17:31,959
His cell number's dead.

1529
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:33,209
What shall we do?

1530
01:17:34,959 --> 01:17:36,001
What are you worried about?

1531
01:17:36,209 --> 01:17:38,751
You have a mobile, just call Big Fei-Lung!

1532
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:44,459
Hey hey hey!

1533
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:45,876
- Hey.
- Big Fei-Lung.

1534
01:17:46,251 --> 01:17:49,126
Why are you guys here?
I was looking for you yesterday.

1535
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,126
Weren't you looking for hookers?

1536
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:51,292
Why are you everywhere on the news?

1537
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:53,834
Hey, let's not talk about it now.
We need your help to get back to Hong Kong.

1538
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:54,959
- Today?
- Yes.

1539
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:56,626
But I already have 5 other clients.

1540
01:17:56,792 --> 01:18:00,667
Surely your boat is big enough to fit us too?

1541
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,834
OK, OK...gotta wait for one more client,
come on in...

1542
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:05,126
You're very lucky!

1543
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:07,251
Tonight I have a big client he's really nice.

1544
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:08,501
Good, OK.

1545
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:09,834
Oh, Brother Tao!

1546
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:13,126
Oh, Brother Tao! Brother Tao.

1547
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:18,917
Sit sit sit. Just wait a bit won't be long.

1548
01:18:19,084 --> 01:18:20,042
OK.

1549
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:21,334
Please sit.

1550
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:24,417
Brother Tao. Sorry but there's a surprise tonight.

1551
01:18:24,584 --> 01:18:27,042
What surprise? It's surprisingly crowded haha...

1552
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:32,251
With Sir Chan...and them.

1553
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:34,667
Right, just let me finish loading,
then we're ready to go in 10 minutes!

1554
01:18:34,834 --> 01:18:36,626
OK.

1555
01:18:41,376 --> 01:18:43,084
Sir?

1556
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:47,042
Yes, we teachers...

1557
01:18:47,209 --> 01:18:48,459
...are always called "sir"...

1558
01:18:48,626 --> 01:18:52,709
...this, "sir" that, ain't that right Sir Lee?

1559
01:18:52,876 --> 01:18:54,042
That's right, Chow Sir!

1560
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:56,209
Hahahaha.

1561
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:58,626
Well, "Sir", which subject do you teach?

1562
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:00,876
Human biology.

1563
01:19:02,417 --> 01:19:05,709
But it's tough to live in an expensive place

1564
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:06,959
like Hong Kong. Our pay is not great...

1565
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:10,042
...so that's why we came over to Macau

1566
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:13,501
to earn some extra cash doing massage.

1567
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:16,459
In Kowloon City I'm known as...

1568
01:19:17,376 --> 01:19:18,709
...the Hands of God.

1569
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:20,376
You know how many people I have
to jerk off in a day?

1570
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:22,334
- Heard of it before?
- Nope.

1571
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:23,667
Oh too bad.

1572
01:19:23,917 --> 01:19:25,167
Sometimes you really can't tell
from just appearance alone!

1573
01:19:25,334 --> 01:19:27,542
Look at my size...

1574
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:32,084
I also have my secret techniques!

1575
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:34,167
- That's true pride!
- Sorry, sorry...

1576
01:19:34,376 --> 01:19:36,376
And you? What are you good at?

1577
01:19:39,751 --> 01:19:41,751
I'm...

1578
01:19:42,501 --> 01:19:43,584
known for my "motor tongue".

1579
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:47,209
Hahaha.

1580
01:19:52,834 --> 01:19:53,834
What are you doing with your hand?

1581
01:19:54,001 --> 01:19:57,334
Huh? My hand?

1582
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:01,417
Haha, good question, what am I doing with my hand?
Let me tell you...

1583
01:20:05,709 --> 01:20:07,709
...I help clients jerk off...

1584
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:10,209
Since I've been doing it for so long,
my hands get cramped up and they twitch.

1585
01:20:10,376 --> 01:20:12,001
See?

1586
01:20:12,167 --> 01:20:13,626
To stop the twitching?

1587
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:16,209
I just need to keep doing what I'm good at.

1588
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:18,042
Don't believe me? You wanna try?

1589
01:20:18,209 --> 01:20:19,876
- No thanks.
- Are you sure?

1590
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:23,834
Looking at your build,

1591
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:25,209
hard to believe you are a teacher.

1592
01:20:25,376 --> 01:20:26,959
- OK.
- I never did study much...

1593
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:30,959
But my English...l can spell
at least all 12 months.

1594
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:33,209
My son, he's in high school...

1595
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:36,334
...and can't even spell them sometimes.
Isn't it ridiculous?

1596
01:20:36,501 --> 01:20:37,584
Exactly.

1597
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:39,584
Hey, Why don't you try spelling one?

1598
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:42,917
Spell September.

1599
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:50,084
S...e...p...

1600
01:20:54,876 --> 01:20:59,501
...t-e-m-b-e-r. September.

1601
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:02,626
Haha, I'm the one teaching English,
not him. You got it wrong.

1602
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:03,667
Haha.

1603
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:07,626
Teachers like us know

1604
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:08,959
so little nowadays.

1605
01:21:09,126 --> 01:21:10,792
We have plenty of school holidays,

1606
01:21:10,959 --> 01:21:12,626
meet a lot of
school girls, that's about it...

1607
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:14,834
Learning all the extra stuff isn't
so useful in the end.

1608
01:21:15,459 --> 01:21:16,251
Let's go...

1609
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:17,751
Bye...

1610
01:21:17,917 --> 01:21:19,959
You sons of bitches don't move!

1611
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:22,876
I've seen plenty of cops in my life...

1612
01:21:23,501 --> 01:21:26,334
...but never have I seen such disgraceful ones!

1613
01:21:27,001 --> 01:21:28,626
Pretending to be teachers is bad enough...

1614
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:30,209
...but pretending to be male prostitutes?

1615
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:31,876
Fat boy!

1616
01:21:32,042 --> 01:21:33,751
You! Don't you have mirrors at home?

1617
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:39,709
Before I started using AK47s...

1618
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:41,542
...I once ran a male hustler club.

1619
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:45,834
Hands of God? How about I show you
God with my gun!

1620
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:48,376
Fucker, I'll shoot you in the head.

1621
01:21:48,626 --> 01:21:51,209
No, don't! Sorry.

1622
01:21:51,376 --> 01:21:55,126
Yes, we're cops. But we're just cops
who are passing by.

1623
01:21:57,334 --> 01:22:01,334
Look, we don't know each other, nor do we have
any grudges between one another.

1624
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:08,376
Let's just pretend we've never met...

1625
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,042
...and nothing happened, OK?

1626
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:13,292
Don't move.

1627
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:15,584
Hold your hands up.

1628
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:25,751
I told you I would personally arrest you!

1629
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:27,042
Well done!

1630
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:28,167
Good job.

1631
01:22:28,334 --> 01:22:29,542
- Can we go now?
- Not yet.

1632
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:31,417
Four more are coming.

1633
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:33,334
Four more?

1634
01:22:41,167 --> 01:22:43,126
Don't move or I'll shoot him.

1635
01:22:58,292 --> 01:22:59,376
The police are here!

1636
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:04,084
- Run!
- Hey, where's Brother Tao?

1637
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:06,542
Arrested! Hurry and move
or we'll get arrested too!

1638
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:09,459
Hurry up!

1639
01:23:12,626 --> 01:23:13,667
Police, don't move!

1640
01:23:18,042 --> 01:23:19,792
Doesn't seem to be these four.

1641
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:22,959
Yes, it's them!! Don't you recognize them?

1642
01:23:24,126 --> 01:23:26,167
Oh yeah, guys, move in!

1643
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:27,376
Yes sir!

1644
01:23:48,459 --> 01:23:49,459
I'll give it to him.

1645
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:52,334
Kwong, wrap it up!

1646
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:56,417
You probably recognise me.

1647
01:23:58,459 --> 01:24:00,834
You're a handsome guy, it's hard not to.

1648
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:03,834
Sorry!

1649
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:05,751
Thank you!

1650
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:11,501
But don't worry, after you framed me,
I went to prison.

1651
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:14,459
Then my boss thought that I was a traitor.

1652
01:24:14,626 --> 01:24:16,667
So I escaped to Taiwan...

1653
01:24:16,959 --> 01:24:19,042
But it was a good thing since I met my wife there.

1654
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:21,167
I'll show you something.

1655
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,334
Look, my daughter! She's three. Isn't she pretty?

1656
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:26,042
Yes!

1657
01:24:26,251 --> 01:24:28,376
Every day after work, I'll go over her
English courses with her.

1658
01:24:28,709 --> 01:24:31,292
Sometimes things are meant to be...

1659
01:24:31,626 --> 01:24:34,626
When you think that
there's no way out, think again.

1660
01:24:36,751 --> 01:24:37,834
Josh!

1661
01:24:38,584 --> 01:24:39,584
Yes!

1662
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:42,876
Thank you.

1663
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:47,292
If you want your daughter
to learn English, call me.

1664
01:24:47,709 --> 01:24:52,084
You know, I'm from Boston. Bye now!

1665
01:24:52,542 --> 01:24:53,376
OK.

1666
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:56,001
Come on! We gotta get back before seven!

1667
01:24:56,167 --> 01:24:58,167
What's the rush, there's plenty of time!

1668
01:25:23,209 --> 01:25:25,834
Why did you stop? Where are we?

1669
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,126
Hi, I need to call a tow truck!

1670
01:25:33,751 --> 01:25:37,751
We're in San Tin...We'll pay you extra, OK?

1671
01:25:38,751 --> 01:25:40,834
...OK, thanks.

1672
01:25:41,792 --> 01:25:43,292
Call a taxi, Dried Shrimp.

1673
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:47,001
What time is it?

1674
01:25:47,834 --> 01:25:49,792
- How far is it from here?
- 6:20!

1675
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:50,959
1O kilos.

1676
01:25:51,126 --> 01:25:52,584
Why don't we run back?

1677
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:56,459
Are you serious? Captain, a taxi is better.

1678
01:25:56,626 --> 01:25:58,042
The last time we trained, it took us longer than
half an hour to run that distance.

1679
01:25:58,209 --> 01:26:00,251
But the last time we had our full gear
on plus equipment!

1680
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:01,667
But we haven't slept for two nights!

1681
01:26:01,834 --> 01:26:03,459
Shouldn't we think of something else?

1682
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:04,917
I remember what you said last time:

1683
01:26:05,834 --> 01:26:07,042
confidence does not make you a winner.

1684
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:09,126
But with no confidence, you'll definitely lose.

1685
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:14,001
I believe in Captain,
and I believe in this operation.

1686
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:59,376
Hey, your hard-on finally went soft!

1687
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,667
Hey, it's gone!

1688
01:27:00,834 --> 01:27:04,959
Yes, I'm not hard anymore!

1689
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:18,626
I can't go on.

1690
01:27:20,292 --> 01:27:22,667
Come on!

1691
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:56,209
Time!

1692
01:27:57,501 --> 01:27:58,584
6:55!

1693
01:28:00,167 --> 01:28:01,667
Now who'll dare say...

1694
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:05,209
that B-team can't finish 10K in 35 minutes!

1695
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:10,584
Captain! I'm so happy to be a part of
the "Sex War" operation!

1696
01:28:11,209 --> 01:28:13,709
I think it was a success!

1697
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:17,876
I'm also very happy to be getting prostitutes
with everyone else!

1698
01:28:19,376 --> 01:28:22,459
Next time, include me as well!

1699
01:28:22,626 --> 01:28:23,626
This part...

1700
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:25,126
...is a bit harder to say!

1701
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:32,251
Just like, "What happens in Vegas,

1702
01:28:32,459 --> 01:28:33,626
stays in Vegas"...

1703
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,376
what happens in Macau,

1704
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:36,751
there won't be a second round.

1705
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:39,376
In the end, our "Sex War" operation was
just a waste of money and sweat.

1706
01:28:40,376 --> 01:28:41,876
For example, Ka Ho's under investigation

1707
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:44,459
and even got his dad into the hospital...

1708
01:28:44,626 --> 01:28:46,126
But in the end the two of them patched things up.

1709
01:28:46,292 --> 01:28:49,167
Strangely, they both previously went
for that flat-chest bitch...

1710
01:28:49,334 --> 01:28:50,876
...and they both promptly rejected her.

1711
01:28:51,042 --> 01:28:53,584
Ho said that when his father gets better...

1712
01:28:53,751 --> 01:28:57,209
...he'll take him to No.1 Clubhouse
for a family trip.

1713
01:28:57,376 --> 01:28:58,792
As for Josh, you'd never guess.

1714
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,001
For someone so uptight who has never been
with a hooker...

1715
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:02,542
...he finally goes out and sleeps with one...

1716
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:04,501
...even telling her later on to move to his flat
and become a trainee.

1717
01:29:04,709 --> 01:29:08,292
Everything's been so clear...

1718
01:29:08,459 --> 01:29:11,792
...starting from the beginning...

1719
01:29:11,959 --> 01:29:13,167
...it definitely shows that he's from Boston...

1720
01:29:13,334 --> 01:29:16,001
...buttoned-up on the outside,
but open-minded on the inside.

1721
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:20,959
And what did I gain from this "Sex War" operation?

1722
01:29:21,126 --> 01:29:22,001
Two syllables:

1723
01:29:22,167 --> 01:29:23,667
Respect.

1724
01:29:24,167 --> 01:29:26,584
Weren't we going to a buffet? Why Japanese food?

1725
01:29:26,751 --> 01:29:28,376
After all that...

1726
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:31,459
...we should remind ourselves of
the taste of some raw tuna.

1727
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:35,334
How's it down there?

1728
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:36,792
My flag's still at half mask...

1729
01:29:36,959 --> 01:29:37,959
...as if saluting some soldiers
who were killed in action.

1730
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,167
What? I'm just copying him.

1731
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:45,084
You learn from him,
and you'll also get our death stares.

1732
01:29:45,251 --> 01:29:46,126
Fuck.

1733
01:29:46,292 --> 01:29:50,042
Shame on you, asshole.

1734
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:51,459
Cheers.

1735
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:54,001
Josh, cheers.

1736
01:29:54,167 --> 01:29:55,167
Cheers.

1737
01:29:56,751 --> 01:29:59,459
Seriously, if you don't want
to stay in our B-team...

1738
01:29:59,626 --> 01:30:02,042
...I'll inform the head
and transfer you to A-team.

1739
01:30:02,292 --> 01:30:04,667
What now? You wanna kick me out?

1740
01:30:06,376 --> 01:30:08,876
OK, I did once think that you were rubbish...

1741
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:11,334
But now I discover that you are a great leader.

1742
01:30:12,292 --> 01:30:14,709
Thanks for the flattery,
but I'm not as good as A-team.

1743
01:30:14,876 --> 01:30:16,167
But I don't think you were right about something.

1744
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:17,417
What?

1745
01:30:18,584 --> 01:30:22,292
You said one guy alone cannot save a team...

1746
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:25,459
...but this "Sex War" operation
was successful...

1747
01:30:25,876 --> 01:30:26,709
...because of you.

1748
01:30:27,959 --> 01:30:30,667
You always said you wanted to be the best
of the best within the SDU...

1749
01:30:31,334 --> 01:30:32,459
...You're now on your way.

1750
01:30:32,667 --> 01:30:34,834
The most important skill is flattery.

1751
01:30:35,084 --> 01:30:36,334
Am I good enough then?

1752
01:30:36,584 --> 01:30:37,834
Just right.

1753
01:30:40,376 --> 01:30:42,251
Hong Kong's most wanted criminal Wang Tao

1754
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:44,917
has been arrested by Macau officers.

1755
01:30:45,209 --> 01:30:48,667
According to leads, this is the biggest
and longest search operation...

1756
01:30:48,834 --> 01:30:52,292
...made by Macau authorities.

1757
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:55,917
The police spokesman also said that
one of Wang Tao's accomplices...

1758
01:30:56,084 --> 01:30:56,917
...was working undercover with the police...

1759
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:59,376
What the hell, I arrested him!

1760
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:01,376
Forget it.

1761
01:31:03,209 --> 01:31:04,042
In other news,

1762
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:06,501
Hong Kong police force's
Special Duties Unit...

1763
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:08,126
known as SDU...

1764
01:31:08,292 --> 01:31:11,084
beat 16 other countries to claim 1st place...

1765
01:31:11,251 --> 01:31:13,626
in the International American

1766
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,501
Special Forces competition.

1767
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:17,376
Can you tell us the secret to SDU's
success this time?

1768
01:31:17,959 --> 01:31:21,292
Team spirit, that's the most important thing.

1769
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:24,417
Team spirit!

1770
01:31:24,584 --> 01:31:27,459
We always get along well as a unit!

1771
01:31:27,751 --> 01:31:29,459
So what if you're good at shooting...

1772
01:31:29,626 --> 01:31:30,751
...you can't beat us at ejaculating!

1773
01:31:30,959 --> 01:31:33,459
Good one. How'd you say it in English?

1774
01:31:33,626 --> 01:31:34,459
I am proud of you!

1775
01:31:34,626 --> 01:31:35,251
Proud!

1776
01:31:35,417 --> 01:31:36,417
Proud!

1777
01:31:40,209 --> 01:31:42,126
Have we had enough? If not, we change venues.

1778
01:31:42,417 --> 01:31:43,542
But we just sat down.

1779
01:31:43,709 --> 01:31:45,417
There's a new place in Macau...

1780
01:31:45,584 --> 01:31:51,459
where you eat abalone on top of
a real woman's abalone...

1781
01:31:51,626 --> 01:31:53,501
...And you eat without chopsticks...

1782
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:59,667
Each piece must be eaten using only one's mouth.

1783
01:32:01,251 --> 01:32:03,917
Gosh! Just thinking about it makes me wanna...
I am ready!

1784
01:32:04,084 --> 01:32:05,792
Really? Again?

1785
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:07,626
We just got back.

1786
01:32:07,792 --> 01:32:09,126
OK, sorry, I didn't say anything.

1787
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:10,292
We can think about it.
