1
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,880
Uncle Yi, I want an ultraman.

2
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,248
But I want the lemon flavor.

3
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,977
Sure.

4
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,051
That's all right.

5
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,040
Keung, where are you?

6
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,168
Thank you, Uncle Yi.

7
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,484
It's over done!

8
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,665
Leung.

9
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,114
Chief, what's the matter?

10
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,883
See? The pork is over done.
I told you many times.

11
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,653
Pork is the star of this dish.

12
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,423
I... I just went to toilet
for a while, so...

13
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,092
It's ridiculous!

14
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,359
You're not in the mood all the day,
see? You caused trouble at last.

15
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,632
What's the matter with you?

16
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,936
There is only half hour
to the banquet.

17
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,538
Now, the pork is over done.

18
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,908
Can we serve without pork
in the pot?

19
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,741
What we can do now
is to use the ''Blade''.

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,517
Leung, borrow the Blade.

21
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,432
The 5th descendant of the
Dragon Head Blade, Wong Bing-Yi,

22
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,067
I'd like to borrow the Blade now.

23
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,560
With the unification of the blade,
we'll do it righteous and filial.

24
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,152
Ah Yi borrows the Blade.

25
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,119
What is it about?

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,088
The Chief is holding the
Dragon Head's Blade.

27
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,091
What is it for?

28
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,390
Why did he take out the Blade?

29
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,700
This is my first time to view it.

30
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,068
Wah, this is my first time
to view this Blade.

31
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,466
Don't block my way;
I want to see how wonderful it is.

32
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,633
Bravo!

33
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,236
Woo, it's really wonderful!

34
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,971
Second-Uncle,
you can tell the guests that...

35
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,573
The banquet will be on time.

36
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,409
So, I'll count on you
to make us some tasty pork.

37
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,210
Sure, no problem.

38
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,112
This is a red pocket for you,
for working smooth.

39
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:34,980
Thank you, Uncle.

40
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,815
Okay, the banquet
will be started on time.

41
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,617
Come on, help me to serve.

42
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:43,388
Little sis, 5th-Uncle...

43
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,258
We wish you happy birthday!
Thank you.

44
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,960
We wish you happy birthday!

45
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:48,760
Good! Thank you for coming.

46
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,595
Thank you, Uncle.

47
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,796
Come on, cheers...

48
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,031
Cheers!

49
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,500
What a smell!

50
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,132
It smells so good!

51
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,208
Give me the salt.

52
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,267
Here it is.

53
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,281
It's done!

54
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,896
Eat more! Come on, enjoy your food.

55
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,065
Come on,

56
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,261
come...

57
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,803
Take it to that table,
and that table, too.

58
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,972
Eat more! Come on...

59
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,173
Eat more.

60
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,936
Cheers!

61
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,614
If Master Joe was here,
we wouldn't have been that messy.

62
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,118
Even he is willing to help,
I won't let him do it.

63
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,688
I promised my brother
to let his son achieve great success.

64
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,487
But he is still a cook out there.

65
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,459
Tidy up now.

66
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,588
Chief, oh no! What a trouble!

67
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,293
Why did you do that?

68
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:45,911
Don't let him go!

69
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,113
He is the cook!
He intended to poison us!

70
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,214
He should not be the Chief
of our village.

71
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,580
Dare you want to go?

72
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,831
Who asked you to do so?

73
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,267
It's Master Joe.

74
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,223
Wong Bing-Yi,
since you borrowed the Blade,

75
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,092
You must be responsible.

76
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,687
Wong, you are not qualified
to be a cook.

77
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,201
I was being set up!

78
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,335
Did I misunderstand you?

79
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,738
You cooked the pork.

80
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,208
Yi, you don't deserve
to have the Blade.

81
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,676
Master Joe is the man behind...

82
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,813
I decided to expel Wong Bing-Yi.

83
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,647
Wong Kai-Joe will substitute him
for a while.

84
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:13,918
KUNG FU CHEFS

85
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,296
Tai-tung Martial Arts

86
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:52,664
Students, before your graduation,

87
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:56,368
Let's see who can put the emblem
of the school...

88
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,770
Back to its original place.

89
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,039
The one who can do it will be...

90
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,337
The first honored graduate
of the school.

91
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,336
On your mark...

92
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,949
Get set...

93
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,882
Go!

94
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,177
It is with him!

95
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,339
Go after him!

96
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,285
Don't let him go!

97
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,990
Give it to me.

98
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,725
Are you kidding me?

99
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,057
It is with the principal.

100
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,364
Don't come to me...

101
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,566
Respect your principal!

102
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,034
Who wants to be
the first honored graduate?

103
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,298
Move!

104
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,238
Are you serious?

105
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,867
I wanna be!
Me too...

106
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,321
I don't have it,

107
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,089
it's not with me...

108
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,091
I passed it to Ken'ichi.

109
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,583
It is with Ken'ichi.

110
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,030
Where is it? Where is it?

111
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,064
Principal, who did you give it to?

112
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,233
I... I gave it to that jerk!

113
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,268
Where is he now?

114
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,896
You bastard!

115
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,938
Pal, thank you.

116
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,065
Has Ken'ichi left?

117
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,566
I am asking you.

118
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:45,070
Has Ken'ichi left?

119
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,672
I think he has just left,
maybe, perhaps,

120
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,731
I think so...

121
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,976
It's nonsense to ask you.

122
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,012
I'll go after him.

123
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,580
You don't need to.

124
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,141
He asked me to give you this box
before he left.

125
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:20,199
How dare he fool the principal!

126
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,091
Watch out, it's breaking!

127
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,260
It's school property.

128
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,864
Principal, I have to leave now.

129
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,500
Politeness, justice, honesty and
honor, patience and self control.

130
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,335
I will never forget
what you have taught me.

131
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,970
I made you these noodles.

132
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:30,032
This is just a token from me.

133
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,747
It's very kind of you.

134
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,977
Rise.

135
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,919
After leaving the school,

136
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,155
go to this place to look for
master Sum Wai-tak.

137
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,723
What for?

138
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:49,661
From this great master,
you can learn what you're lacking for.

139
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,831
The principles of gourmandism are:
color, smell, taste, conception and appearance.

140
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,099
Ken has cooking talent.

141
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,901
But he doesn't know much
about the idea of food.

142
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,970
However, we cannot teach
the conception of food.

143
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,973
He must figure it out in his life.

144
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,876
If he can match himself with food,
then, he can make it.

145
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,712
Although Ken isn't a local student,

146
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,282
He has strong passion
on Chinese cookery.

147
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,618
After some time, I am sure...

148
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,780
He can become a great cook.

149
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,987
Sis, do you think the smell of tea
can distract me?

150
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,394
Please wait!

151
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,035
Forget it, Ching,

152
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,266
I am sure you can't get it
just by smelling.

153
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,108
We should get ready
for servicing now.

154
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,167
Come on, just say you can't make it.

155
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,947
Kam-lui, I told you, remember?

156
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,117
I want to serve our guests
nutritious soup,

157
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,119
But not this kind of mixture.

158
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,110
You can smell it, can't you?

159
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,327
This seems to be a nutritious soup,

160
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,729
But actually,
it is medicine instead of soup.

161
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,598
Take it away.

162
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,700
I tried so much time
and effort for it.

163
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,603
What a pity
that you still miss something.

164
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,938
I have already helped you.

165
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,134
But my sister is really great!

166
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,711
Kam-lui, what is this black stuff?

167
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,480
It's disgusting!
Take it away please.

168
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,539
Take it away!

169
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,685
My sister is really great!

170
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,697
Have the goods
we ordered been delivered?

171
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,893
I am now going to check it.

172
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,186
What's wrong with you?

173
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,053
Come and give me a hand.

174
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,646
All right.

175
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,458
Let me help you.

176
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,359
Thank you.

177
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,884
You're welcome.

178
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:40,531
Are you kidding?

179
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,000
You messed up everything!

180
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:42,567
I am sorry...

181
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:46,526
If any of it breaks,
I'll cut the bill, you got it?

182
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,540
Come on.

183
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,381
Oh my head...

184
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,915
It hurts!

185
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,218
What are you looking at?

186
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,381
Move those stuffs inside, hurry up!

187
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:04,889
No, I...

188
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,625
I'll check the bill later,
but I must check the goods first

189
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,861
If any breaks, I won't pay the bill.

190
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,130
If one is rotten,
I'll deduct 2 dollars, and so on

191
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,398
Move now!

192
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,764
Hurry up!

193
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:20,336
You too, move those
near the door way first.

194
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,905
Excuse me, sir...

195
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,909
Do you want to eat in?

196
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,037
This way please.

197
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,514
What did you say?

198
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,316
I said...

199
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,651
First, I am not a coolie.

200
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,253
Second, I didn't mean to hurt you.

201
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,223
Third, I came here for Master Sum.

202
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,191
The forth thing is...

203
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,994
I am really hungry.

204
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,931
Why didn't you voice out?

205
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,367
Did you give me a chance?

206
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:27,338
I'll make you pay for
hurting my head later.

207
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,172
Please wait for me
right here for a minute.

208
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,273
Since our shop
has just been in service,

209
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,476
If you don't mind,
please sit inside.

210
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,239
It's all right.

211
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,092
You want to see Master Sum?

212
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,562
So, you must tell me
what ingredients are put inside the soup.

213
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,664
Sis.

214
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,416
Thank you.

215
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,051
The water from 3 rivers.

216
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,627
So, you are a gourmet!

217
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,618
I just know something about food.

218
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,236
Did you make this Pu-er tea
with old tangerine peel?

219
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,805
How did you know it?

220
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,808
Old orange peel is as precious
as old ginseng.

221
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,279
To mix tangerine peel
with old Pu-er tea,

222
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,546
It is the best drink to quench thirst 
and helps good digestion.

223
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,286
You know much about tea.

224
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,656
However, our food is even better
than this tea.

225
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,792
I am sure you have never
tried that before.

226
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,894
What do you want to order, sir?

227
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,230
What is the signature dish
of your restaurant?

228
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,033
All are signature dishes,
you can order anything you'd like to eat.

229
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,035
''Cabbage in clear water'' please.

230
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,737
''Cabbage in Clear Water''?

231
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,007
So, is it steamed or boiled?

232
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,910
Mind your tongue!
That is the famous Szechwan dish.

233
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,312
Although this is a
Cantonese restaurant,

234
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:18,647
Since you order it,
we'll get it ready for you.

235
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,188
Have you figured it out?

236
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:29,026
Are you kidding me?
This tastes like medicine.

237
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,830
But I know there is
something special inside.

238
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,333
This is a soup with 3 snakes
and a turtle. So disgusting!

239
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,768
I can't imagine that
you're really great!

240
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:42,672
So, do you know how to make
''Cabbage in clear water''?

241
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,508
I am a cook,

242
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:48,479
Sure I know how to make
such simple dish.

243
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,709
One for me please.

244
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,621
Master, why does he order
Szechwan food in a Cantonese restaurant?

245
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,322
It's weird.

246
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,324
I think this is a cook too.

247
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,728
He wants to try me
with that special dish.

248
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,062
Luckily I am not nobody.

249
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,082
Bro, there is just cabbage and soup,

250
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,951
Why people view this
as the greatest dish of all?

251
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,422
Yi, for we villagers,
cabbage has special meaning.

252
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,391
It is like our family.

253
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,459
Normally, we won't pay
special attention to it,

254
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,029
However, when we lose it,
we will miss it.

255
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,899
You'll understand the warmth
and love of it

256
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,867
Check please.

257
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:56,814
Sir, is there any problem
with our cabbage?

258
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,516
Be frank...

259
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,712
This is far beyond standard.

260
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,888
I don't understand what you mean...

261
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,223
The cabbage and chicken are not bad.

262
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,959
But the process is wrong.

263
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,295
The cabbage you made here...

264
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:14,398
Any cook can make it.

265
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,459
The original one
has not been found for ages.

266
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,229
May I know your name?

267
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,107
Wong Bing-Yi.

268
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,909
Master Wong,
if you are a great cook,

269
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,277
Dare you compete with me?

270
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,678
What if we lose,

271
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,114
I will
leave this restaurant forever.

272
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:30,948
If you lose,

273
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,951
please wash dishes here for a year.

274
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,953
Why should I compete with you?

275
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,090
As a cook,
you have no reason to reject me.

276
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:42,526
Okay, but I need an assistant.

277
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,459
I can tell it's done by Master Sum
at the first bite.

278
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,761
It's really tasty!

279
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:20,364
So soft and spicy,
and it's not greasy at all.

280
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,901
This has been the signature dish
of our restaurant.

281
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,970
And, he has a good assistant.

282
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,073
So, to him,
this is just a piece of cake.

283
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,307
Master Wong.

284
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,177
What do you think about his dish?

285
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,578
It's just fair.

286
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,556
Master Wong, it has been put here
for quite a long time, it's cold.

287
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,024
Watch out!

288
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:48,192
Sis.

289
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,253
Oh no! Why is it so hot?

290
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,573
What's wrong with it?

291
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,747
Actually, wrapping the skin...

292
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,949
It is a thin layer of sugar.

293
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,818
It is for keeping the duck warm.

294
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,352
Although the duck
is put on the table,

295
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,287
Actually, it's still
in the process of cooking.

296
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,455
It is very...

297
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,390
What is it?

298
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,142
I lost.

299
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,720
Why?

300
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:54,558
It is ''Wu-jo's 8 Treasure duck'',
not any cook has ever made it for century.

301
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,327
I can't imagine that...

302
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,025
It tastes like what it is written
in the cook book.

303
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,756
To make this dish,
we can't use knife.

304
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,228
Not any knife should be used.

305
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,415
Duck's meat is hard to handle,
once it is in touch with knife,

306
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:24,047
The tissue will go hard and still,
and the fibres will break.

307
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,423
Master!

308
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,191
Don't stop him.

309
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,860
I know very well about Master Sum.

310
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,531
After leaving school, go to
this place for Master Sum Wai-tak.

311
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,233
By the way, he always wants to leave.
Master Sum Wai-tak, please wait.

312
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,302
What did you say?

313
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,293
Sum Wai-tak?

314
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,274
Right, Sum Wai-tak is my father.

315
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,408
However...

316
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,010
He passed away last year.

317
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:51,039
Sum Wai-tak
was my brother's master, too.

318
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,651
I know.

319
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,953
When I tasted the duck,

320
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,251
I knew who you are.

321
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,123
So, about my story...

322
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:08,032
Master Wong, I heard something
about you before.

323
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,067
I believe that you're innocent.

324
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,070
Why?

325
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,272
It's basic instinct.

326
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:20,142
A cook who loves cooking
will never do that.

327
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,452
Have some tea please.

328
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,545
Thank you.

329
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,625
Master Sum left.

330
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:38,152
We have no cook now.

331
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,699
I just know following cook book.

332
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,402
And my sister doesn't want to
be a cook, too.

333
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,106
If this goes on, our restaurant...

334
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,775
It will be closed sooner or later.

335
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,411
And this family business will...

336
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:57,414
My brother adopted
your father's cooking skills

337
00:26:57,415 --> 00:27:00,250
And I adopted cooking skills
from my brother.

338
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,988
So, I am obliged to help maintain
the fame of ''Sum's restaurant''.

339
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,757
But I just can't do it alone.

340
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,293
Master Wong, do you want...

341
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,563
The young man I just saw is smart.

342
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,531
He is just a little bit arrogant.

343
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,233
If he is well trained,

344
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,936
sure he will become great.

345
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,071
But he may not stay.

346
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,873
I believe that he will.

347
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,409
But under one condition.

348
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,977
Please go ahead.

349
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,680
Never call me Master Wong again.

350
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,483
Call me Ah Yi.

351
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,919
All right, Ah Yi.

352
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,801
I want to challenge you!

353
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,436
What do you want to compete with me?

354
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,370
Cutting skills.

355
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,780
I am sorry...

356
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,375
It's up to you.

357
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,188
He knows how to cut a globe fish!

358
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,816
No matter why he wants to
compete with cutting skills.

359
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,127
To cut a globe fish,
the cook must be quick and sharp.

360
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,330
There are many thorny things
on the skin of the fish.

361
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,399
You can cut it with the knife.

362
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,401
But it's really difficult.

363
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:28,770
That's why it can test
the cutting skill of a cook.

364
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,109
Finished.

365
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,312
This is the sliced globe fish.

366
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,347
If you have worries, so...

367
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:41,579
you can eat it half hour later.

368
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,590
I can't smell the stink of fish
but tastes it so sweet and fine.

369
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,325
It's neither like fish nor meat

370
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,851
This is the top level
of eating globe fish!

371
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,721
It's okay, it's my turn now

372
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,738
It is a bream.
The Japanese take bream as the king of fish.

373
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,306
Its taste is elegant and subtle.

374
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,968
But comparing with globe fish...

375
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,247
This is cold slice of bream.

376
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,849
It doesn't seem to be special.

377
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,717
No matter how skillful is Yi,

378
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,585
how can the taste of bream
be better than globe fish?

379
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,485
You...

380
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,933
What knife did you use?

381
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,536
The knife was cold.

382
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,138
The meaning of ''Sushi'',

383
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,508
that is to keep the fish
at a cool stage.

384
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,239
So, the fish will be tasty

385
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,047
After the sudden cold feeling,

386
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,817
the temperature inside the mouth
mixes with the tasty fish,

387
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:51,015
it is stirred inside the mouth
and spread outwards.

388
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,096
The frozen bream
seems to have rebirth!

389
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:02,395
This is the best taste of all.

390
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,971
I am not the loser.

391
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,463
I failed to have a better knife.

392
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,748
You're really great.

393
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,493
Actually, this is the secret
of cutting skills.

394
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,368
Who messed up with my sauce?

395
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,838
Why are all the carrots gone?

396
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,309
The money for paying the vegetables...

397
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,176
I have to pay the supplier now...

398
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,345
The money for paying the vegetables...

399
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,319
All right, don't cry please.

400
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,617
I have got it ready.

401
00:30:58,923 --> 00:30:59,990
Come on, you cry whenever you get
the money for paying vegetables!

402
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,016
8,000...

403
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:13,027
Your order please.

404
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,672
Who told you to delivery
these things to us?

405
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:18,368
This is the order of Mr. Wong.

406
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,878
Thank you.

407
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,045
What is it?

408
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,046
Whose stuff is it?

409
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,515
To make tangerine sauce,
using pineapple juice is okay.

410
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,651
But you must add chrysanthemum
and iquorice.

411
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,087
With a green root and tastes ho

412
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,722
you can't say it a radish.

413
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,090
From Wong Bing-Yi.

414
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,391
He must have done something
to my sauce.

415
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,359
He has gone too far!

416
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,971
Master...

417
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,674
Don't greet me master,
I haven't promised to be your master yet.

418
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,576
Master, come on!

419
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,944
I'll do anything you tell me.

420
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,867
When heaven wants someone
to do something big,

421
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,202
first,
the guy will be bitterly trained.

422
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,705
He will be hungry and tired,

423
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,775
he will be trained
to be calm and mild.

424
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,744
So he will gain strength
from his training.

425
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,594
Are you sick?
How can this sharpening these knives...

426
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,931
You didn't sleep but sharpen
the knife in the middle of the night.

427
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,566
And you made it till dawn!

428
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,268
Will you let others sleep?

429
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,837
I can't imagine that,
you're not only selfish,

430
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,673
but also deaf!

431
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,208
You're sick!

432
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,768
What do you want?

433
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,513
Do you think
you're acting horror film?

434
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,316
Who do you want to scare
with these knives?

435
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,018
You know? You made sounds all night,

436
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,654
I just couldn't sleep all night.

437
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,622
Are you crazy?

438
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,325
Are you sick?

439
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,226
Why don't you go for medication?

440
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,930
Master.

441
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,544
I've already done
with the rusted knives.

442
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,019
So, we...

443
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,987
When can we start?

444
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,989
Start what?

445
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,359
Of course, you teach me cooking.

446
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,919
What else do you think?

447
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:56,197
Since this is sharpened by you,
you'll use it.

448
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,137
What?

449
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,905
Didn't you hear it clear?

450
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,636
I... I want to know...

451
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,937
When will you teach me cooking?

452
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,613
So boring!

453
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,275
Peel it, there are some baskets
waiting for you

454
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:16,882
Master, I...

455
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,865
Ah Yi.

456
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:37,107
Tomorrow is the first day
you become the chef,

457
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:40,110
this is your uniform.

458
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,238
Thank you.

459
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:47,044
Yi, what is bothering you?

460
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:52,022
I am worrying about my nephew.

461
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,362
Silky cake.

462
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,730
Greatest of all.

463
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,632
Crab meat in bird's nest soup.

464
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,568
Deep boiled snakes in oil
with ginger and green onion.

465
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,803
Cod fish's face in herbal sauce.

466
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,238
BBQ conch.

467
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,906
Abalones in winter melon.

468
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,308
BBQ goose.

469
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,275
Greatest mouths of all.

470
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,277
Curry seafood.

471
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,745
Roasted pigeon in lavender sauce.

472
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,414
Fried shark-fins.

473
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,715
Seafood in pumpkin.

474
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,184
World's selection of Sushi.

475
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,380
Treasure of the world...

476
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,090
Master Joe.

477
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:32,528
This is the newly designed menu
for the new shop, are you satisfied with it?

478
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,727
Just follow your idea. Dismiss.

479
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,606
Master, this is the new chef
I hired for the new branch.

480
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,472
Master Sum.

481
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,212
Where did you work before?

482
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,203
Sum's Restaurant.

483
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:56,219
So, why do you want to work in the
King of Cantonese Restaurant?

484
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,823
Master Joe, actually, I always wish...

485
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,884
to work in such a big group.

486
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,424
I want the truth.

487
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,467
The reason is...

488
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:14,004
I... I made a small mistake
in a cooking race.

489
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,531
I was defeated by 2 persons, so...

490
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,278
Master Sum is quite famous
in this field.

491
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,805
What is that guy?
What cook can defeat you?

492
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,283
That guy is named...

493
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,843
Wong Bing-Yi.

494
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,856
Pardon?

495
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,018
He is named Wong Bing-Yi.

496
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,429
Wong Bing-Yi.

497
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,600
I won't be merciful this time.

498
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:49,004
Master Joe, but the Chief has left
the village for ages.

499
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,377
Are you on his side?

500
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,679
I am not!

501
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,546
What I mean is...

502
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,582
I mean, you are his nephew...

503
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,950
Actually, it's nonsense.,,

504
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,884
Why do you treat him as your foe?

505
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,252
Right? Listen to me...

506
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,051
Shut up!

507
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,491
He stole the Dragon Head Blade,
he hurt my father.

508
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:11,586
At that time, did he remember
that's his brother?

509
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,272
Give it back to me!

510
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,469
Give it back to me!

511
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,114
Give it back to me!

512
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,753
Give it back to me!

513
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,492
Give it back to me!

514
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,327
Give it back to me!

515
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,319
Brother, stay calm please.

516
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,798
Why?

517
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,767
That blade is mine!

518
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,603
I am the Best Chef of the World!

519
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,868
You have no right to hide the blade.

520
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,348
I don't need this.

521
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,750
I want the Dragon Head Blade!

522
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,690
Where is mine?

523
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,525
Where is my Dragon Head Blade?

524
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,859
Give it back to me!

525
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:38,670
He always wants that blade and
to be the Chief of the Village.

526
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,770
Wake up please!

527
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,762
Bro, drink no more!

528
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,622
At the most critical moment...

529
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,757
Ah Yi!

530
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,363
Brother!

531
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,535
I witnessed it.

532
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,372
It's him...

533
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,507
He set a trap for my dad.

534
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,340
My brother got hurt
because of saving me.

535
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,512
It hurts!

536
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,382
My father can no longer be a cook,
all because of him.

537
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,578
He left the village.

538
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,352
Bro!

539
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,088
Stop it, I have no face
to stay any longer.

540
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,149
Please take care of Joe for me.

541
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,768
I promised my brother to
take good care of Joe, God knows that...

542
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,170
He forced by me
to leave the village.

543
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,730
It's a revenge.

544
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,733
How can he do this to you?

545
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,446
Forget it.

546
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,814
Let bygones be bygones.

547
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,152
In fact, your brother...

548
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:26,523
Won the championship of the
World's Best Chef for 2 consecutive years.

549
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,959
He gained much fame for us.

550
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,156
My brother is really a genius.

551
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,934
Wrong.

552
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,506
Wrong!

553
00:40:55,553 --> 00:41:00,649
Wrong!

554
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:38,328
Cutting skills is easy to learn
but it needs non stop practice.

555
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,832
For common people,
they just need to cut sharp.

556
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,901
If a cook has better skills,

557
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:48,638
He can handle chopping, hitting,
mashing and slashing well.

558
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,407
That's already good skills.

559
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,977
But if he wants to be a good cook,

560
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:58,615
Different ingredients need
different kinds of cutting skills.

561
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:02,449
So, it'll take much time
for real practice.

562
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,235
Is it really that bad?

563
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,571
I did it purposely for you.

564
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,506
Thank you.

565
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:26,532
I worked for one whole day.

566
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,777
I already said thank you.

567
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,239
Don't be cocky!

568
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,020
Other than being fresh,
to make great food,

569
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,123
We need great sauce to mix with it.

570
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,492
Saucing is the soul of a dish.

571
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,260
But different people
have different taste.

572
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:27,130
But you will get bored for eating
same good food everyday.

573
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,999
So,
all good cook can make good sauce.

574
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,967
Try it.

575
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:48,117
Ying, why the sauce you made...

576
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,382
are of the same taste?

577
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,123
I think so.

578
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,148
Kam-lui.

579
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,135
Actually it's easy to make sauce.

580
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,805
You just need a little patience.

581
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,973
And some interest.

582
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:14,272
And some imagination.

583
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,612
There are few kinds of taste,

584
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:20,950
sweet, sour, bitter, hot and salty.

585
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,319
Just keep on trying.

586
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,190
Mix with different ingredients.

587
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:31,752
Then find out the best choice
of the guests, that's all

588
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:38,162
Is it tasty, Kam-lui?

589
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,636
It is sweet and salty.

590
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,806
But I can taste sweet and hot
at the same time, it's great!

591
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,366
How did you make it?

592
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:51,013
I haven't tried
such special sauce before.

593
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,049
Kam-lui, let's use this sauce today.

594
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,450
Keep it well in the kitchen.

595
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,085
Be careful.

596
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,611
Kam-lui, I'll go with you.

597
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,019
Ying, what are you thinking?

598
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:12,301
I am thinking of a way to
make some delicious bean cube pudding.

599
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,036
You want to make bean cube pudding?

600
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,305
Greet me Master,
then I'll teach you.

601
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,875
But I want the most delicious one.

602
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:19,675
No problem.

603
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:22,474
Master!

604
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:27,250
The ingredients for making
bean cube pudding is simple.

605
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:31,120
Soy beans, water and some substance
for solidification.

606
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:35,887
The proportion of soy beans
and water may differ.

607
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,096
Today, I'll teach you frying.

608
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:54,010
For fried eggs, we love it to be
smooth, soft and with good smell.

609
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,178
But how to make it smooth?

610
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,346
The key point is to let air
enter the eggs.

611
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,115
Bubble it.

612
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,250
This shares the same theory
of making spongy cakes.

613
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,586
I'll show you.

614
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,248
Then, you'll count on yourself.

615
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,168
The key point is to control
the temperature of the oil.

616
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,337
Just one word, don't use boiled oil.

617
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,805
If so, the eggs will be over done.

618
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,432
Come on.

619
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:48,664
Master, it is not done yet.

620
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,634
Yes, it is to use the remained heat
to make it all done.

621
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,169
So, the eggs will be smooth.

622
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,607
Other than skills of frying,

623
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,175
You need to pay attention
to breaking the eggs.

624
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,611
And, most important of all is
to control the heat.

625
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,547
It is simple to talk,
but it is really difficult.

626
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:08,117
This is named
''Wong Po thousand layers of egg''

627
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:11,320
Fried egg is just a simple dish.

628
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,584
But it is really
something interesting!

629
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:23,596
More simple the dish is,
more difficulty to be handled.

630
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:31,070
It's really hard to cook great dish.

631
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,810
No. it is not hard to cook well

632
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,211
It's really hard
to perform well in life.

633
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,552
Move now.

634
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
This is the home made sauce.

635
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,302
It's tasty!

636
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,037
This is newly made,
hope you all like it.

637
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,505
Boss. I haven't eaten
so delicious chicken.

638
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,473
What is it about?

639
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,179
What is it?

640
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,307
What is it?

641
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,720
This is...

642
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,089
Obviously, it is a nail.

643
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,190
Nail?

644
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,726
Can you get it? It is a nail.

645
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,962
What is it? What nail
you're talking about?

646
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,465
There are some nails in the pot,
it can kill.

647
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,967
Oh no!

648
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,468
Don't get nervous,
it's just a misunderstanding.

649
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,303
Kam-lui.

650
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,371
What's the matter?

651
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,669
Take a look at yourself.

652
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,509
It is so sharp!

653
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,479
I don't mind nails,
but I want it cooked well.

654
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,675
It's not steak, I don't want it raw.

655
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,689
I don't eat half done nails.

656
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,024
Do you want to kill me?

657
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,049
What do you want?

658
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,595
You've gone too far!

659
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,431
If you want to mess up,
you must use better trick

660
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,501
How can you add so many nails
into the pot at the same time

661
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,670
On one would be so stupid to cook
like this. This is a set up.

662
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,305
It's hard to say

663
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:13,109
There was precedent from your chef.

664
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,168
What did you say

665
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:26,154
Wong Bing-Yi, this is the present
from Master Joe

666
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:29,925
Don't worry.

667
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:35,489
This is the pork done by Chef Tin,
no problem.

668
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,665
You'd better watch out

669
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,475
Why?

670
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,739
What does that mean?

671
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:13,202
I can't imagine our business
would become this worse.

672
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,368
Don't panic

673
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,875
Why not?

674
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:23,345
Now, we have no customers to come.

675
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:27,509
If this goes on,
our restaurant will be closed.

676
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,886
Who brought this bad luck to us,
huh?

677
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,561
Brother Choi,
are you here for shopping?

678
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,566
Let me handle it.

679
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:54,435
We'd better not talk behind someone

680
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,138
Don't mess up.

681
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:05,382
I don't want to be bullied
but say nothing.

682
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,959
Boss, how is it?

683
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,722
How are you?

684
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,666
Bitch! You're looking for trouble!

685
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:18,400
What's up?

686
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,095
Get lost!

687
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:22,834
What's up?

688
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,634
What are you doing?

689
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,139
Stop!

690
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,646
So? Be a hero?

691
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,320
Go!

692
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,407
What's up?

693
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,136
Run!

694
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:52,554
Stop!

695
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,790
Freeze!

696
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:55,557
Stay where you are!

697
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,117
Freeze!

698
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,492
Hurry up!

699
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:02,865
Stop!

700
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,856
Freeze!

701
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,159
Stop!

702
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,990
What do you want?

703
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,015
No, thanks.

704
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,832
Disgusting! Why did you stop me?

705
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:50,302
Look, you have flour
all over your face.

706
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:08,530
Come and join the 7th competition
for the ''Best Cook of China''.

707
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,800
This campaign is held
once in 4 years, the winner...

708
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:15,003
Will be awarded
the Best Cook of China,

709
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,505
If we win...

710
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,307
then we can save the reputation
of our restaurant.

711
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,435
Let's hurry back to tell sister
about this.

712
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:43,599
My dad is the best cook,
he is the best of the best.

713
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,236
I can win the cup easily.

714
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,831
No one can compete with me.

715
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,942
I want a revenge.

716
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,951
Hello...

717
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,187
Okay, I'll wait for you.

718
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,823
Sorry, I can't go.

719
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,103
Yes, what's the matter?

720
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,806
Master, please tell us.

721
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,408
Sister and I take you as our family.

722
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:29,139
We can help you!

723
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:34,208
This matter bothers me
for a long time, I must settle it.

724
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,056
Master, if you don't go,

725
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:42,591
we won't go too.

726
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:47,495
Ken, this is a
very important competition.

727
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,634
What is more important
than the competition?

728
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,369
Yes!

729
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,206
It's you and this restaurant.

730
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,008
I don't care the name
of being the best cook.

731
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:03,579
For the restaurant,
you must try hard in the competition.

732
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,015
Don't worry, we'll wait for you.

733
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,915
Ken...

734
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:26,392
Take this with you.

735
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,350
Now, the competition for the
Best Chef of China begins.

736
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,115
All the representatives are now
coming in the studio.

737
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,790
Uncle Yu.

738
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,172
This is a great event
for all great chefs in China.

739
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
the 7th competition for the Best Chef of China...

740
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:40,976
now begins!

741
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:43,812
Let me introduce the judges.

742
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,481
Mr. Yu Pun-cheong,
the chairman of the China Cookery Association.

743
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,816
Mr. Liu Chi-wing, the famous chef.

744
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,551
Ms Wong Lai-mui,
from the Catering Alliance.

745
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,420
Mr. Wong Wing-chi, the chairman of the
Association For Catering Services Management.

746
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,689
Mr. Yu Wing-man, the honorary
chairman of the Chef Association.

747
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,691
Before the competition,

748
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,526
We'd like to
invite the last champion,

749
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:01,292
Master Tin Chou-dao from the King
of Cantonese Restaurant.

750
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:10,168
Hi, Master Tin.

751
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,577
Master.

752
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,608
Is he still your master?

753
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,684
Kam-lui.

754
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,553
He is no longer your master.

755
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,431
Fatty,

756
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,300
I want to challenge you.

757
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,536
Fine, where are you from?

758
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:44,130
Sum's Restaurant.

759
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,808
Now, I have to tell you the rules.

760
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,477
This is a knockout.

761
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,580
The judgment team will pick
2 teams among the 6.

762
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,016
They will have the final race
in next time.

763
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:55,584
Now, the theme is knife.

764
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:59,087
In that case,
other than the outlook and taste,

765
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,289
The chef must express
the skills of cutting.

766
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,859
The cutting skill is a must
of a real chef.

767
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,160
You'll have one hour
for competition.

768
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,459
Now, I declare the race begins.

769
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,223
I want to cook Szechwan's style
of Ox head.

770
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,272
I understand what my master means.

771
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:20,575
Kam-lui, we must win.

772
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,177
Let's charge up.

773
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,446
But what should we do?

774
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,682
They are all picking ingredients.

775
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,482
Sis, what should we do?

776
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:57,846
Let's go
''The Four Stuffed Treasures''.

777
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,076
The Four Stuffed Treasures''?

778
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:02,584
It's more complicated than
''Eight Treasure Duck''.

779
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:05,553
Don't you have confidence
in your cutting skills?

780
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,156
I got it.

781
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:12,527
I'll get the chicken, duck,
pigeon and the fillings.

782
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,586
And quail too.

783
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:34,809
Sis, what is Tin doing?

784
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:43,525
This is the famous dish of Szechwan.

785
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,756
It pays much attention in cutting.

786
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,452
The competition is truly excited.

787
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,387
Now, we have only...

788
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,446
3 minutes left.

789
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,505
Now, we have only...

790
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,371
1 minute.

791
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,841
5.

792
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,736
4.

793
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,948
3.

794
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:45,917
2.

795
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,092
Time's up.

796
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,265
The 6 dishes are...

797
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:00,168
Grapes and Fish from Wah Shun Hotel.

798
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,571
Clams in chicken soup
from Chai-tai Restaurant.

799
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,606
Golden Ox and Duck,
from Wan's Restaurant.

800
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,374
Phoenix's tail and peach blossom
from Grandma's Restaurant.

801
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,510
Four Stuffed Treasures
from Sum's Restaurant.

802
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,412
Szechwan's Ox Head from the King
of Cantonese Restaurant.

803
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,047
Judges,

804
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:14,243
What a headache!

805
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,554
The fish and the clams...

806
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:22,123
The cutting skills and procedures
are all right.

807
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,226
But they picked wrong ingredients.

808
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,494
About the duck,

809
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:30,398
It tastes well and spicy,
it looks good too.

810
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:33,101
However, when it is peeled,

811
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,904
the body of the duck was broken.

812
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,174
And the dish from Grandma's
Restaurant, the prawns are fresh,

813
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,209
The outlook is nice too.

814
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,678
But the strong taste of wine..

815
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,013
Just covers the taste of prawns.

816
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,815
For the Four Stuffed Treasures,

817
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:48,049
The cutting skills are excellent.

818
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,820
The quail is in the pigeon,
then in the chicken,

819
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:54,155
And finally inside the duck.

820
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:56,358
It's a mixture of meat,
but with clear and layered taste.

821
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,193
It's really wonderful.

822
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:02,364
About the Ox Head,
it's really a master piece.

823
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,266
It's a difficult task indeed.

824
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,167
From the cutting skills
and the choice of ingredients,

825
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,203
it's of the top level.

826
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,971
Wonderful!
This ox-head is really wonderful.

827
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,207
Now the judges
are having the final judgment.

828
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,734
The 2 final teams
will be announced soon, they are...

829
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:24,386
Ken from the Sum's Restaurant
and Tin from the King of Cantonese Restaurant.

830
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,616
Congratulations!

831
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,123
We have made it!

832
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,357
We won!

833
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,560
I wish Master was here with us.

834
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:52,075
Master, we can enter the final race.

835
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,683
But the other team is...

836
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,879
The Sum's Restaurant.

837
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,121
Master Joe, don't worry.

838
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,487
I can figure it out.

839
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,160
Let me go.

840
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,341
Ken...

841
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,483
Come and fight with me
if you're a man.

842
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:55,267
Ken, watch out!

843
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:08,753
Ken.

844
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:13,628
Nice food can make people happy.

845
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,797
But if the chef isn't happy,

846
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:19,165
How can he pass happiness
to others through food

847
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,037
When I see you going back
to the village,

848
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,006
I can tell you
finally figured it out.

849
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:27,031
Thank you.

850
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,246
I must thank you indeed.

851
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,214
If you didn't teach them
whole-heartedly,

852
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:36,149
They can't enter the final race.

853
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:41,255
It's all because they are talented.

854
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:25,158
Ken, thank you.

855
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,703
I am so sleepy...

856
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,672
Are you?

857
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,834
Don't sleep,

858
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:38,044
I have many places to go with you.

859
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:44,043
I have so many things to do with...

860
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:49,214
Why happiness is so short?

861
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,692
Because...

862
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:04,465
People have many unhappy times.

863
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,980
Ah Yi!

864
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,619
You're something!

865
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,518
Sit down.

866
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,469
What do you want?

867
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,774
Nothing, I just come to see you.

868
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:15,140
Isn't it too late?

869
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,011
Not late at all.

870
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:21,744
If you are a bit late,
you will not see him.

871
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:26,421
Cut the crap, you're not welcomed.

872
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:29,290
I am your nephew,
I came specially to see you.

873
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,192
Why don't you want to see me?

874
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:35,094
I think I am not heartless.

875
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,633
Uncle, your student
wounded my fellows.

876
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,735
He should pay for it, right?

877
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:44,728
You know pretty well
for what you did.

878
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,636
What?

879
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:55,850
You kicked my father away
for the Dragon Head's Blade.

880
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,419
Now, you want to take my cup
for the Best Chef away?

881
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,856
This should be what I told you.

882
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:04,552
Your uncle did nothing wrong.

883
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,229
Stop!

884
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,664
No matter you believe it or not.

885
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,866
Your father has his reason to leave.

886
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:15,336
Okay, I have my reason to...

887
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:18,067
Fix that bastard and the bitch.

888
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:31,185
This is between us,
there is nothing to do with them.

889
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:32,914
Yeah.

890
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,724
I don't want to do anything to them.

891
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:40,428
I just bring you some present.

892
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,396
Leung.

893
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,365
Master Joe, why not leave him alone?

894
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:47,096
I don't want to repeat.

895
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:52,974
Well, my fellows accidentally
locked up your student,

896
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:56,778
And a young girl inside the freezer.

897
01:11:56,779 --> 01:12:01,045
And they accidentally
locked up the door.

898
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,085
But don't worry.

899
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:08,044
I've kept the key for you,
do you want it?

900
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:11,992
I am sorry, I failed to hold it.

901
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:15,923
The key is inside,
take it or leave it.

902
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:21,424
You can take time to consider it,
but they just can't wait too long.

903
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,375
I've got no choice.

904
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:42,452
No!

905
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,885
That key is not the true one.

906
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,094
I've got the right one here.

907
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:58,964
Come on, it's over

908
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,543
Thank you.

909
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,774
I must thank you indeed.

910
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:18,693
Master Joe has lost control,
please take care.

911
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:20,718
Take care.

912
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,692
The next Best Chef
will be found soon.

913
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:53,717
The theme of this final race is...

914
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,363
Soup.

915
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,265
The Chinese always need soup
in the banquet.

916
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,966
Other than making soup,

917
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:00,401
the participants must achieve
one more thing.

918
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,069
That is...

919
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,871
Purity.

920
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:07,466
Sis, what does it mean?

921
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,777
That means, no favour
is the best favour.

922
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:13,381
So the cook cannot add seasoning
into the soup.

923
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:15,149
In the arts of cookery,

924
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,820
One way is to cook without seasoning,

925
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:21,222
it is to let people eat the real
taste of the food.

926
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,924
The best cooks of the Shang
and Chau Dynasty,

927
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,992
They integrated the arts of cookery,

928
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:27,728
With philosophy.

929
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:29,397
That is ''Purity is the best''.

930
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,865
I can't imagine

931
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:35,002
you'd give up the competition
for that rusty blade.

932
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,904
Do you like this blade?

933
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,606
You really like to be Chief.

934
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:40,174
Don't blame me of being heartless.

935
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:43,075
I'll let you be the Chief
for one day.

936
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:47,042
I now declare the beginning
of the competition.

937
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:52,879
Ken, what soup should we make?

938
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:16,434
Why these cabbages be viewed
as the best food?

939
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:22,216
Cabbages mean a lot
to the villagers.

940
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,852
They are like our family.

941
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,088
Normally, you won't feel much.

942
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:31,125
But when you lose it,
you'll feel how much you love it.

943
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,856
You'll understand it in future.

944
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,965
Kam-lui.

945
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:40,263
Let's do ''Cabbage in Clear Water''.

946
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:45,863
Master said, the fame of the
''Best Cook'' isn't important to him

947
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:51,077
Except Sum's Restaurant!

948
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:56,609
All right, let's do Cabbage
in Clear Water.

949
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,541
Master Tin, how can you
get these ingredients...

950
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:28,980
Preparation is always important
to achieve success.

951
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,321
This dish is named with
''Clear Water'',

952
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:37,349
it is because the soup is as
clear as water.

953
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:48,669
The method is, mined the chicken,

954
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:51,866
Then drop them evenly
inside the chicken soup.

955
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:59,614
When it sinks,

956
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:05,109
It'll absorb the remained fats
and other materials.

957
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,683
Kam-lui, give me the cabbages.

958
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,224
This is not normal cabbages.

959
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:21,991
We must pick the heart
of the cabbages.

960
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:32,606
Then, get some fine needles.

961
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:36,941
Stab the needles into the leaves
to make numerous fine holds.

962
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,646
But don't ruin the outlook
of the cabbages.

963
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,043
Then, add the cooked soup...

964
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:12,480
into the pot with cabbages.

965
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,506
And then put it into the steamer
for steaming.

966
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,395
What is it about?

967
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:37,404
For traditional method,
only the bottom is heated.

968
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,206
All the heat comes from the bottom.

969
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:43,477
Now, he uses this device,

970
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,674
So it will receive heat evenly
all over the pot.

971
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:38,192
When it is opened, even the Buddha
is attracted to jump over the wall for it.

972
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:41,195
''Buddha jumps the wall'',
it is absolutely the best soup of the world.

973
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:45,325
''Cabbage in Clear Water''
is no match for it.

974
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,567
Wait.

975
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,688
Make it a signature dish
of Sum's Restaurant.

976
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:23,463
Sis, that's my bean cube.

977
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,712
Dragon Head's Blade.

978
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:11,049
How come the bean cube disappeared?

979
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,835
Why the Szechwan cook view this
as treasure?

980
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:32,006
To make great food with some cheap
and common ingredients,

981
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,608
It is the top level of cookery.

982
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:37,978
And it implies the top level
of life performance.

983
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:40,714
This is the real taste of food.

984
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:43,843
Purity!

985
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,375
The result is,

986
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:45,903
Ken Lung from Sum's Restaurant
is the new Best Cook of China.

987
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:50,575
Bravo! Wonderful!

988
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,785
Brother.

989
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:06,625
Since you have come,
why not have a sip?

990
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,191
This is the taste of cabbage.

991
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,332
Who is he?

992
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,367
We haven't seen for ages,
how are you?

993
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:42,165
I am fine.

994
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:46,762
Master Wong, how are you doing?

995
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:51,778
Is she Sam Ching?
Right.

996
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:53,714
So you must be Sum Ying.

997
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:57,050
Sis, is he...

998
01:25:57,051 --> 01:26:01,388
He is our father's student,
Master Wong Bing-kei.

999
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:03,550
Dad...

1000
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,794
Dad, please don't leave.

1001
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,564
Dad...

1002
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:12,633
Dad...

1003
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,567
I did it wrong!

1004
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:20,974
Ken, my brother and I think that
you're the best one to have this blade.

1005
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:23,410
We hope you can make good food
with it.

1006
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:26,175
To give happiness to the world!

1007
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,890
I will leave tomorrow.

1008
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,592
So soon.

1009
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:40,027
This is my plan.

1010
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,528
I have something for you.

1011
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,829
It's made by me.

1012
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,922
Sorry.

1013
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,367
Don't be sad.

1014
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:05,049
I've tried it.

1015
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:08,187
What you made is best.

1016
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:12,292
I don't know what sister
is thinking.

1017
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:15,887
Why makes you learn cooking skills
from Wong?

1018
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:21,935
Master is a great cook, it's really
your luck to learn cookery from him.

1019
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:24,233
I don't care.

1020
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:29,070
I'll leave this happiness to you!

1021
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,244
No laughing.

1022
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:33,614
Look at you! You're so handsome!

1023
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:34,781
Really?

1024
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:36,550
You have rosy cheeks!

1025
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,385
I am sure you don't have
female students in school.

1026
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:40,954
Haven't you been touched by women?

1027
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:42,888
So what?

1028
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:47,327
No matter you're not gentleman like.

1029
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,763
And you are stupid!

1030
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:52,132
You are so dull!

1031
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:56,228
You don't understand girls at all!

1032
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:58,805
But I can cook

1033
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:01,171
No need to understand girls
