1
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,959
Uncle Yee, l want an ultraman.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,960
But l want the lemon flavor. ure.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,600
That's all right.

4
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Keung, where are you? Thank you, Uncle
Yee.

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,240
lt's over done!

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Leung.

7
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,119
Chief, what's the matter?

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,879
See? The pork is over done.

9
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,559
Pork is the star of this dish.

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
l... l just went to toilet for a while, so...

11
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,239
lt's ridiculous!

12
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,240
You're not in the mood all the day, see? You
caused trouble at last.

13
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,879
What's the matter with you?

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,880
There is only half hour to the banquet.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,919
Now, the pork is over done.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Can we serve without pork in the pot?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What we can do now is to use the ''Blade''.

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,679
The 5th descendant of the Dragon Head
Blade, Wong Ping-yee,

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,359
l'd like to borrow the Blade now.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,360
With the unification of the blade, we'll do it
righteous and filial.

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Ah Yee borrows the Blade.

22
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,520
The Chief is holding the Dragon Head's Blade.

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,320
What is it for?

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,079
Why did he take out the Blade?

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,799
This is my first time to view it.

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Wah, this is my first time to view this Blade.

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Don't block my way; l want to see how
wonderful it is.

28
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Woo, it's really wonderful!

29
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,239
Uncle Two, you can tell the guests that...

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,439
The banquet will be on time.

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
So, l'll count on you to make us some tasty
pork.

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,479
Sure, no problem.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,399
This is a red pocket for you, for working
smooth.

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,439
Thank you, Uncle.

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Okay, the banquet will be started on time.
Come on, help me to serve.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,279
We wish you happy birthday! Thank you.

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,239
We wish you happy birthday!

38
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,959
Come on, cheers...

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Cheers!

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
lt smells so good!

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,319
Give me the salt.

42
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Here it is.

43
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,320
lt's done!

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,439
Eat more! Come on, enjoy your food.

45
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,359
Come on, come...

46
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Take it to that table, and that table, too.

47
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Eat more! Come on... Come on

48
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,760
lf Master Joe was here, we wouldn't have been
that messy.

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Even he is willing to help, l won't let him do it.

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
l promised my brother to let his son achieve
great success.

51
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,679
But he is still a cook out there.

52
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,759
Tidy up now.

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Chief, oh no! What a trouble!

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why did you do that?

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,239
Don't let him go!

56
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,359
He is the cook! He intended to poison us!

57
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
He should not be the Chief of our village.
Dare you want to go?

58
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Who asked you to do so?

59
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
lt's Master Joe.

60
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Wong Ping-yee, since you borrowed the
Blade,

61
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,999
You must be responsible.

62
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Wong, you are not qualified to be a cook.

63
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,199
l was being set up!

64
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,639
Did l misunderstand you?

65
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,799
You cooked the pork.

66
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Yee, you don't deserve to have the Blade.

67
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,759
Master Joe is the man behind...

68
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,760
l decided to expel Wong Ping-yee.

69
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Wong Kai-Joe will substitute him for a while.

70
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Tai-tung Martial Arts

71
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Students, before your graduation,

72
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Let's see who can put the emblem of the
school...

73
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,879
Back to its original place.

74
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,039
The one who can do it will be...

75
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,040
The first honored graduate of the school.

76
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,240
On your mark...

77
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Get set...

78
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Go!

79
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,559
lt is with him!

80
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Go after him!

81
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,759
Are you kidding me?

82
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,359
lt is with the principal.

83
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Don't come to me...

84
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,439
Respect your principal!

85
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,479
Who wants to be the first honored graduate?

86
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,999
Move!

87
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Are you serious?

88
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,360
l don't have it, it's not with me...

89
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,039
l passed it to Ken'ichi.

90
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,040
lt is with Ken'ichi.

91
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,399
Where is it? Where is it?

92
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,039
Principal, who did you give it to?

93
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,040
l... l gave it to that jerk! Where is he
now?

94
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,040
You bastard!

95
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Pal, thank you.

96
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,919
Has Ken'ichi left?

97
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,599
l am asking you.

98
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Has Ken'ichi left?

99
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
l think he has just left, maybe, perhaps, l think
so...

100
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,959
lt's nonsense to ask you.

101
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,959
l'll go after him.

102
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,559
You don't need to.

103
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,560
He asked me to give you this box before he
left.

104
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,040
How dare he fool the principal!

105
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Watch out, it's breaking!

106
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,240
lt's school property.

107
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,679
Principal, l have to leave now.

108
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,479
Politeness, justice, honesty and honor,
patience and self control.

109
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,279
l will never forget what you have taught me.

110
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,039
l made you these noodles.

111
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,040
This is just a token from me.

112
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,520
lt's very kind of you.

113
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Rise.

114
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,839
After leaving the school,

115
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,840
go to this place to look for master Sum
Wai-tak.

116
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,639
What for?

117
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,640
From this great master, you can learn what
you're lacking for.

118
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,680
The principles of gourmandism are: color,
smell, taste, conception and appearance.

119
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,119
Ken has cooking talent.

120
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,879
But he doesn't know much about the idea of
food.

121
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,919
However, we cannot teach the conception of
food.

122
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,920
He must figure it out in his life.

123
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,879
lf he can match himself with food, then, he can
make it.

124
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,759
Although Ken isn't a local student,

125
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,760
He has strong passion on Chinese cookery.

126
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,519
After some time, l am sure...

127
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,520
He can become a great cook.

128
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Sis, do you think the smell of tea can distract
me?

129
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Please wait!

130
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,959
Forget it, Ching,

131
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,960
l am sure you can't get it just by smelling.

132
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,039
We should get ready for servicing now.

133
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Come on, just say you can't make it.

134
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,119
Kam-lui, l told you, remember?

135
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,079
l want to serve our guests nutritious soup,

136
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,199
But not this kind of mixture.

137
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
You can smell it, can't you?

138
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,640
This seems to be a nutritious soup,

139
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
But actually, it is medicine instead of soup.

140
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,559
Take it away.

141
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,519
l tried so much time and effort for it.

142
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,520
What a pity that you still miss something.

143
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,159
l have already helped you.

144
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,160
But my sister is really great!

145
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,079
Kam-lui, what is this black stuff?

146
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,359
lt's disgusting! Take it away please.

147
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Take it away!

148
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,640
My sister is really great!

149
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,559
Have the goods we ordered been delivered?

150
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,560
l am now going to check it.

151
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,599
What's wrong with you?

152
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,399
Come and give me a hand.

153
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,359
All right.

154
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,239
Let me help you.

155
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,279
Thank you.

156
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
You're welcome.

157
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,079
Are you kidding? You messed up everything!

158
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,199
l am sorry...

159
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
lf any of it breaks, l'll cut the bill, you got it?

160
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,599
Oh my head...

161
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,719
lt hurts!

162
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,039
What are you looking at?

163
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Move those stuffs inside, hurry up!

164
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,959
No, l...

165
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,479
l'll check the bill later, but l must check the
goods first.

166
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,919
lf any breaks, l won't pay the bill.

167
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,279
lf one is rotten, l'll deduct two dollars, and so
on.

168
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Move now! Hurry up!

169
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,920
You too, move those near the door way first.

170
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,599
Excuse me, sir...

171
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Do you want to eat in?

172
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,720
This way please.

173
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,479
What did you say?

174
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,079
l said...

175
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,639
First, l am not a coolie.

176
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,239
Second, l didn't mean to hurt you.

177
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,759
Third, l came here for Master Sum.

178
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
The forth thing is...

179
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,199
l am really hungry.

180
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,719
Why didn't you voice out?

181
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Did you give me a chance?

182
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,120
l'll make you pay for hurting my head later.

183
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,479
Please wait for me right here for a minute.

184
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,519
Since our shop has just been in service,

185
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,399
lf you don't mind, please sit inside.

186
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,400
lt's all right.

187
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,279
You want to see Master Sum?

188
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
So, you must tell me what ingredients are put
inside the soup.

189
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Sis.

190
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Thank you.

191
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,760
The water from three rivers.

192
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,559
So, you are a gourmet!

193
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,560
l just know something about food.

194
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Did you make this Pu-er tea with old tangerine
peel?

195
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,599
How did you know it?

196
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Old orange peel is as precious as old ginseng.

197
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
To mix tangerine peel with old Pu-er tea,

198
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,400
lt is the best drink to quench thirst and helps
good digestion.

199
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,119
You know much about tea.

200
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
However, our food is even better than this tea.

201
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,400
l am sure you have never tried that before.

202
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,639
What do you want to order, sir?

203
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,919
What is the signature dish of your restaurant?

204
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,639
All are signature dishes, you can order
anything you'd like to eat.

205
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,199
''Cabbage in clear water'' please.

206
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,559
''Cabbage in Clear Water''?

207
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,560
So, is it steamed or boiled?

208
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,079
Mind your tongue! That is the famous
Szechwan dish.

209
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,399
Although this is a Cantonese restaurant,

210
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Since you order it, we'll get it ready for you.

211
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,839
Have you figured it out?

212
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Are you kidding me? This tastes like medicine.

213
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
But l know there is something special inside.

214
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,159
This is a soup with 3 snakes and a turtle.

215
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,359
l can't imagine that you're really great!

216
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,360
So, do you know how to make ''Cabbage in
clear water''?

217
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,679
l am a cook,

218
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Sure l know how to make such simple dish.

219
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
One for me please.

220
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,279
Master, why does he order Szechwan food in a
Cantonese restaurant?

221
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,199
lt's weird.

222
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,079
l think this is a cook too.

223
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,080
He wants to try me with that special dish.

224
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Luckily l am not nobody.

225
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,839
Bro, there is just cabbage and soup,

226
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,799
Why people view this as the greatest dish of
all?

227
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Yee, for we villagers, cabbage has special
meaning.

228
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,239
lt is like our family.

229
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,359
Normally, we won't pay special attention to it,

230
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,079
However, when we lose it, we will miss it.

231
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,080
You'll understand the warmth and love of it in
future.

232
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Check please.

233
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Sir, is there any problem with our cabbage?

234
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,359
Be frank...

235
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,799
This is far beyond standard.

236
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,799
l don't understand what you mean...

237
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,959
The cabbage and chicken are not bad.

238
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,799
But the process is wrong.

239
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,359
The cabbage you made here...

240
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,079
Any cook can make it.

241
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,080
The original one has not been found for ages.

242
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
May l know your name?

243
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,239
Wong Ping-yee.

244
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,159
Master Wong, if you are a great cook,

245
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,399
Dare you compete with me?

246
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,599
What if we lose,

247
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,519
l will leave this restaurant forever.

248
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,520
lf you lose, please wash dishes here for a
year.

249
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,759
Why should l compete with you?

250
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,760
As a cook, you have no reason to reject me.

251
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
Okay, but l need an assistant.

252
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,559
l can tell it's done by Master Sum at the first
bite.

253
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,759
lt's really tasty!

254
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,760
So soft and spicy, and it's not greasy at all.

255
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,240
This has been the signature dish of our
restaurant.

256
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,839
And, he has a good assistant.

257
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,840
So, to him, this is just a piece of cake.

258
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,119
Master Wong.

259
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,079
What do you think about his dish?

260
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,080
lt's just fair.

261
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Master Wong, it has been put here for quite a
long time, it's cold.

262
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,239
Watch out!

263
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,079
Sis.

264
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Oh no! Why is it so hot?

265
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,600
What's wrong with it?

266
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,759
Actually, wrapping the skin...

267
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,719
lt is a thin layer of sugar.

268
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,639
lt is for keeping the duck warm.

269
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,239
Although the duck is put on the table,

270
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Actually, it's still in the process of cooking.

271
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,200
lt is very...

272
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,280
What is it?

273
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,199
l lost.

274
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,519
Why?

275
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,520
lt is ''Wu-jo's 8 Treasure duck'', not any cook
has ever made it for century.

276
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,119
l can't imagine that...

277
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,120
lt tastes like what it is written in the cook book.

278
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,680
To make this dish, we can't use knife.

279
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Not any knife should be used.

280
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,159
Duck's meat is hard to handle, once it is in
touch with knife,

281
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,160
The tissue will go hard and still, and the fibres
will break.

282
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,319
Don't stop him.

283
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,639
l know very well about Master Sum.

284
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,640
After leaving school, go to this place for
Master Sum Wai-tak.

285
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,519
By the way, he always wants to leave.

286
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,199
Master Sum Wai-tak, please wait. What
did you say?

287
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,999
Sum Wai-tak?

288
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,959
Right, Sum Wai-tak is my father.

289
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,159
However...

290
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,599
He passed away last year.

291
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Sum Wai-tak was my brother's master, too.

292
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,279
l know.

293
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,439
When l tasted the duck,

294
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,440
l knew who you are.

295
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,080
So, about my story...

296
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Master Wong, l heard something about you
before.

297
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,879
l believe that you're innocent.

298
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,839
Why?

299
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,199
lt's basic instinct.

300
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,200
A cook who loves cooking will never do that.

301
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,279
Have some tea please.

302
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,280
Thank you.

303
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,439
Master Sum left.

304
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,440
We have no cook now.

305
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,399
l just know following cook book.

306
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
And my sister doesn't want to be a cook, too.

307
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,280
lf this goes on, our restaurant...

308
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,399
lt will be closed sooner or later.

309
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,239
And this family business will...

310
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,240
My brother adopted your father's cooking
skills,

311
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,119
And l adopted cooking skills from my brother.

312
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,120
So, l am obliged to help maintain the fame of
''Sum's restaurant''.

313
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,439
But l just can't do it alone.

314
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,199
Master Wong, do you want...

315
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,200
The young man l just saw is smart.

316
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,279
He is just a little bit arrogant.

317
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,999
lf he is well trained,

318
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,719
sure he will become great.

319
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,879
But he may not stay.

320
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,479
l believe that he will.

321
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,079
But under one condition.

322
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,799
Please go ahead.

323
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,439
Never call me Master Wong again.

324
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,439
Call me Ah Yee.

325
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,440
All right, Ah Yee.

326
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,479
l want to challenge you!

327
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,279
What do you want to compete with me?

328
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,280
Cutting skills.

329
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,320
l am sorry...

330
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,079
He knows how to cut a globe fish!

331
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,079
No matter why he wants to compete with
cutting skills.

332
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,080
To cut a globe fish, the cook must be quick
and sharp.

333
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,200
There are many thorny things on the skin of
the fish.

334
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,239
You can cut it with the knife.

335
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,119
But it's really difficult.

336
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,120
That's why it can test the cutting skill of a
cook.

337
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,999
Finished.

338
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
This is the sliced globe fish.

339
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,839
lf you have worries, so...

340
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,840
you can eat it half hour later.

341
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
l can't smell the stink of fish but tastes it so
sweet and fine.

342
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,439
lt's neither like fish nor meat.

343
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,440
This is the top level of eating globe fish!

344
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,680
lt's okay, it's my turn now.

345
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,919
The Japanese take bream as the king of fish.

346
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,279
lts taste is elegant and subtle.

347
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,280
But comparing with globe fish...

348
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,959
This is cold slice of bream.

349
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,799
lt doesn't seem to be special.

350
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,679
No matter how skillful is Yee,

351
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,680
how can the taste of bream be better than
globe fish?

352
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,120
You...

353
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,919
What knife did you use?

354
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,319
The knife was cold.

355
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,879
The meaning of ''Sushi'',

356
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,880
that is to keep the fish at a cool stage.

357
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,280
So, the fish will be tasty.

358
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,919
After the sudden cold feeling,

359
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,919
the temperature inside the mouth mixes with
the tasty fish,

360
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,920
it is stirred inside the mouth and spread
outwards.

361
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,119
The frozen bream seems to have rebirth!

362
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,120
This is the best taste of all.

363
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,679
l am not the loser.

364
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,680
l failed to have a better knife.

365
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,120
You're really great.

366
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Actually, this is the secret of cutting skills.

367
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,399
Who messed up with my sauce?

368
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Why are all the carrots gone?

369
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
The money for paying the vegetables...

370
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,359
l have to pay the supplier now...

371
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,119
All right, don't cry please.

372
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,120
l have got it ready.

373
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Come on, you cry whenever you get the money
for paying vegetables!

374
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Eight thousand...

375
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,519
Your order please.

376
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,719
Who told you to delivery these things to us?

377
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,720
This is the order of Mr. Wong.

378
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,799
Thank you. Thank you.

379
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,999
Whose stuff is it?

380
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,639
To make tangerine sauce, using pineapple
juice is okay.

381
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,639
But you must add chrysanthemum and
iquorice.

382
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,279
With a green root and tastes hot,

383
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,999
you can't say it a radish.

384
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,239
From Wong Ping-yee.

385
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,359
He must have done something to my sauce.

386
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,360
He has gone too far!

387
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,759
Master...

388
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
Don't greet me master, l haven't promised to
be your master yet.

389
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,439
Master, come on!

390
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,440
l'll do anything you tell me.

391
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,919
When heaven wants someone to do
something big,

392
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,239
first, the guy will be bitterly trained.

393
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,679
He will be hungry and tired,

394
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,680
he will be trained to be calm and mild.

395
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,840
So he will gain strength from his training.

396
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,439
Are you sick?

397
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,440
You didn't sleep but sharpen the knife in the
middle of the night.

398
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,519
And you made it till dawn!

399
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,119
Will you let others sleep?

400
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,959
l can't imagine that, you're not only selfish,

401
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,960
but also deaf!

402
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,239
You're sick!

403
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,959
What do you want?

404
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,199
Do you think you're acting horror film?

405
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,119
Who do you want to scare with these knives?

406
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,119
You know? You made sounds all night,

407
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,479
l just couldn't sleep all night.

408
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,599
Are you crazy?

409
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,159
Are you sick?

410
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Why don't you go for medication?

411
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Master.

412
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,560
l've already done with the rusted knives.

413
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,920
So, we...

414
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,919
When can we start?

415
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,679
Start what?

416
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,680
Of course, you teach me cooking.

417
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,160
What else do you think?

418
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Since this is sharpened by you, you'll use it.

419
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,839
What?

420
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,599
Didn't you hear it clear?

421
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,600
l...

422
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,039
When will you teach me cooking?

423
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,439
So boring!

424
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,440
Peel it, there are some baskets waiting for you

425
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Master, l...

426
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Ah Yee.

427
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Tomorrow is the first day you become the
chef,

428
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,599
this is your uniform.

429
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Thank you.

430
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,880
Yee, what is bothering you?

431
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,120

Treasure of the world... Wait.

447
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,679
Master Joe.

448
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,680
This is the newly designed menu for the new
shop, are you satisfied with it?

449
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Just follow your idea. Dismiss.

450
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,039
Master, this is the new chef l hired for the new
branch.

451
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Master Sum.

452
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,639
Where did you work before?

453
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Sum's Restaurant.

454
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,760
So, why do you want to work in the King of
Cantonese Restaurant?

455
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Master Joe, actually, l always wish...

456
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,680
to work in such a big group.

457
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,080
l want the truth.

458
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,919
The reason is...

459
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,920
l... l made a small mistake in a cooking race.

460
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,360
l was defeated by one persons, so...

461
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,759
Master Sum is quite famous in this field.

462
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,760
What is that guy? What cook can defeat you?

463
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,839
That guy is named...

464
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Wong Ping-yee.

465
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,319
Pardon?

466
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,320
He is named Wong Ping-yee.

467
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,480
Wong Ping-yee.

468
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,039
l won't be merciful this time.

469
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Master Joe, but the Chief has left the village
for ages.

470
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,119
Are you on his side?

471
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,239
l am not! You called him Chief?

472
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,319
What l mean is...

473
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,959
l mean, you are his nephew...

474
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,039
Actually, it's nonsense.,, He has nothing
to do with me.

475
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,759
Why do you treat him as your foe?

476
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,319
Right? Listen to me... Stop!

477
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,320
Shut up!

478
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,999
He stole the Dragon Head Blade, he hurt my
father.

479
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
At that time, did he remember that's his
brother?

480
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Give it back to me!

481
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Give it back to me!

482
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Give it back to me!

483
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Give it back to me!

484
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Give it back to me... Give it back to me...

485
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Brother, stay calm please.

486
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,199
Why?

487
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,199
That blade is mine!

488
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,999
l am the Best Chef of the World!

489
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You have no right to hide the blade.

490
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,879
l don't need this.

491
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,880
l want the Dragon Head Blade!

492
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,560
Where is mine? Where is my Dragon Head
Blade?

493
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Give it back to me!

494
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,760
He always wants that blade and to be the
Chief of the Village.

495
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,239
Wake up please!

496
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Bro, drink no more!

497
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,520
At the most critical moment...

498
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Ah Yee!

499
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,679
Brother!

500
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,919
l witnessed it.

501
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,919
lt's him...

502
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,839
He set a trap for my dad.

503
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,840
My brother got hurt because of saving me.

504
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,439
lt hurts!

505
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,039
My father can no longer be a cook, all because
of him.

506
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,599
He left the village.

507
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,719
Bro!

508
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,479
Stop it, l have no face to stay any longer.

509
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Please take care of Joe for me.

510
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,920
l promised my brother to take good care of
Joe, God knows that...

511
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,639
He forced by me to leave the village.

512
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,640
lt's a revenge.

513
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,400
How can he do this to you?

514
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,079
Forget it.

515
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Let bygones be bygones.

516
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,679
ln fact, your brother...

517
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Won the championship of the World's Best
Chef for 2 consecutive years.

518
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
He gained much fame for us.

519
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,400
My brother is really a genius.

520
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Wrong.

521
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Wrong!

522
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Wrong!

523
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,600
Cutting skills is easy to learn but it needs non
stop practice.

524
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,920
For common people, they just need to cut
sharp.

525
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,519
lf a cook has better skills,

526
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,520
He can handle chopping, hitting, mashing and
slashing well.

527
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,919
That's already good skills.

528
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,479
But if he wants to be a good cook,

529
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Different ingredients need different kinds of
cutting skills.

530
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,280
So, it'll take much time for real practice.

531
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,039
ls it really that bad?

532
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,239
l did it purposely for you.

533
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,919
Thank you.

534
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,920
l worked for one whole day.

535
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,079
l already said thank you.

536
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,080
Don't be cocky!

537
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Other than being fresh, to make great food,

538
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,599
We need great sauce to mix with it.

539
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,959
Saucing is the soul of a dish.

540
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,679
But different people have different taste.

541
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,559
But you will get bored for eating same good
food everyday.

542
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,479
So, all good cook can make good sauce.

543
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Try it.

544
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,120
Ying, why the sauce you made...

545
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,680
are of the same taste?

546
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,959
l think so.

547
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,960
Kam-lui.

548
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Actually it's easy to make sauce.

549
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,039
You just need a little patience.

550
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,399
And some interest.

551
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,400
And some imagination.

552
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,560
There are few kinds of taste, sweet, sour,
bitter, hot and salty.

553
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,159
Just keep on trying.

554
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Mix with different ingredients.

555
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Then find out the best choice of the guests,
that's all.

556
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,640
ls it tasty, Kam-lui?

557
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,399
lt is sweet and salty.

558
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,999
But l can taste sweet and hot at the same
time, it's great!

559
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
How did you make it?

560
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,360
l haven't tried such special sauce before.

561
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,599
Kam-lui, let's use this sauce today.

562
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,119
Keep it well in the kitchen.

563
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,559
Be careful. l got it.

564
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Kam-lui, l'll go with you. All right.

565
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Ying, what are you thinking?

566
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,840
l am thinking of a way to make some delicious
bean cube pudding.

567
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,399
You want to make bean cube pudding?

568
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,879
Greet me Master, then l'll teach you.

569
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,679
But l want the most delicious one.

570
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,319
No problem.

571
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,320
Master!

572
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,040
The ingredients for making bean cube pudding
is simple.

573
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,680
Soy beans, water and some substance for
solidification.

574
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,640
The proportion of soy beans and water may
differ.

575
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,800
Today, l'll teach you frying.

576
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,360
For fried eggs, we love it to be smooth, soft
and with good smell.

577
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,919
But how to make it smooth?

578
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,239
The key point is to let air enter the eggs.

579
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,639
Bubble it.

580
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,919
This shares the same theory of making
spongy cakes.

581
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,039
l'll show you.

582
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,040
Then, you'll count on yourself.

583
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,439
The key point is to control the temperature of
the oil.

584
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,999
Just one word, don't use boiled oil.

585
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,639
lf so, the eggs will be over done.

586
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,640
Come on.

587
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Master, it is not done yet.

588
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,120
Yes, it is to use the remained heat to make it
all done.

589
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,719
So, the eggs will be smooth.

590
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,720
Other than skills of frying,

591
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,639
You need to pay attention to breaking the
eggs.

592
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,959
And, most important of all is to control the
heat.

593
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,960
lt is simple to talk, but it is really difficult.

594
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
This is named ''Wong Po thousand layers of
egg''.

595
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,719
Fried egg is just a simple dish.

596
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,720
But it is really something interesting!

597
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,200
More simple the dish is, more difficulty to be
handled.

598
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,600
lt's really hard to cook great dish.

599
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,079
No. it is not hard to cook well.

600
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,080
lt's really hard to perform well in life.

601
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,520
Chicken pot, please. Enjoy please.

602
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,760
Move now.

603
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,359
This is the home made sauce.

604
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,719
This is newly made, hope you all like it.

605
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,639
Boss.

606
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,640
What is it about?

607
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,879
What is it?

608
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,880
What is it?

609
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,159
This is...

610
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,359
Obviously, it is a nail.

611
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,799
Nail?

612
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Can you get it? lt is a nail.

613
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,560
There are some nails in the pot, it can kill.

614
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,159
Oh no!

615
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,199
Don't get nervous, it's just a
misunderstanding.

616
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,559
Kam-lui.

617
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,799
What's the matter?

618
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,800
Take a look at yourself.

619
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,999
lt is so sharp!

620
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,879
l don't mind nails, but l want it cooked well.

621
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,880
lt's not steak, l don't want it raw.

622
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,359
l don't eat half done nails.

623
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,479
Do you want to kill me?

624
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,480
What do you want?

625
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,959
You've gone too far!

626
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,919
lf you want to mess up, you must use better
trick.

627
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,920
How can you add so many nails into the pot at
the same time?

628
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,479
On one would be so stupid to cook like this.
This is a set up.

629
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,799
lt's hard to say!

630
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,800
There was precedent from your chef.

631
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,560
What did you say?

632
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,120
Wong Ping-yee, this is the present from
Master Joe.

633
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,399
Don't worry.

634
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,400
This is the pork done by Chef Tin, no problem.

635
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,720
You'd better watch out.

636
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,919
Why?

637
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,920
What does that mean?

638
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,520
l can't imagine our business would become
this worse.

639
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Don't panic.

640
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,399
Why not?

641
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,400
Now, we have no customers to come.

642
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,840
lf this goes on, our restaurant will be closed.

643
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,200
Who brought this bad luck to us, huh?

644
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,720
Brother Choi, are you here for shopping?

645
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,840
Let me handle it.

646
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,160
We'd better not talk behind someone.

647
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Don't mess up.

648
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
l don't want to be bullied but say nothing.

649
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,079
Bitch! You're looking for trouble!

650
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,239

Go!

655

What do you want?

662
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,560
No, thanks.

663
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,360
Disgusting! Why did you stop me?

664
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,320
Look, you have flour all over your face.

665

ln that case, other than the outlook and taste,

724
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,799
The chef must express the skills of cutting.

725
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,159
The cutting skill is a must of a real chef.

726
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,639
You'll have one hour for competition.

727
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,640
Now, l declare the race begins.

728
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,400
l want to cook Szechwan's style of Ox head.

729
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,639
l understand what my master means.

730
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,640
Kam-lui, we must win.

731
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,479
Let's charge up.

732
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,599
But what should we do?

733
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,039
They are all picking ingredients.

734
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,040
Sis, what should we do?

735
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,239
Let's go ''The Four Stuffed Treasures''.

736
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,839
The Four Stuffed Treasures''?

737
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,879
lt's more complicated than ''Eight Treasure
Duck''.

738
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,880
Don't you have confidence in your cutting
skills?

739
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,399
l got it.

740
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,400
l'll get the chicken, duck, pigeon and the
fillings.

741
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,760
And quail too.

742
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,840
Sis, what is Tin doing?

743
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,440
This is the famous dish of Szechwan.

744
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,760
lt pays much attention in cutting.

745
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,719
The competition is truly excited.

746
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,199
Now, we have only...

747
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,200
Three minutes left.

748
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,119
Now, we have only...

749
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,120
One minute.

750
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,919
Five.

751
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,920
Four.

752
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,640
Three.

753
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,400
Two.

754
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,440
Time's up.

755
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,639
The six dishes are...

756
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,479
Grapes and Fish from Wah Shun Hotel.

757
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,839
Clams in chicken soup from Chai-tai
Restaurant.

758
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,799
Golden Ox and Duck, from Wan's Restaurant.

759
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,679
Phoenix's tail and peach blossom from
Grandma's Restaurant.

760
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,759
Four Stuffed Treasures from Sum's
Restaurant.

761
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,679
Szechwan's Ox Head from the King of
Cantonese Restaurant.

762
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,359
Judges,

763
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,360
What a headache!

764
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,919
The fish and the clams...

765
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,559
The cutting skills and procedures are all right.

766
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,559
But they picked wrong ingredients.

767
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,839
About the duck,

768
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,840
lt tastes well and spicy, it looks good too.

769
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,399
However, when it is peeled,

770
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,199
the body of the duck was broken.

771
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,200
And the dish from Grandma's Restaurant, the
prawns are fresh,

772
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,439
The outlook is nice too.

773
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,199
But the strong taste of wine...

774
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,479
Just covers the taste of prawns.

775
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,519
For the Four Stuffed Treasures,

776
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,519
The cutting skills are excellent.

777
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,520
The quail is in the pigeon, then in the chicken,

778
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,639
And finally inside the duck.

779
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,999
lt's a mixture of meat

780
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,559
lt's really wonderful.

781
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,560
About the Ox Head, it's really a master piece.

782
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,639
lt's a difficult task indeed.

783
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,640
From the cutting skills and the choice of
ingredients, it's of the top level.

784
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,399
This ox-head is really wonderful.

785
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,519
Now the judges are having the final judgment.

786
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,520
The two final teams will be announced soon,
they are...

787
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Ken from the Sum's Restaurant and Tin from
the King of Cantonese Restaurant.

788
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Congratulations!

789
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,520
We have made it!

790
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,120
l wish Master was here with us.

791
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,200
Master, we can enter the final race.

792
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,279
But the other team is...

793
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,280
The Sum's Restaurant.

794
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,199
Master Joe, don't worry.

795
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,200
l can figure it out.

796
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,560
Let me go.

797
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,480
Ken...

798
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,680
Come and fight with me if you're a man.

799
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,320
Ken, watch out!

800
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,320
Ken.

801
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,839
Nice food can make people happy.

802
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,119
But if the chef isn't happy,

803
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,120
How can he pass happiness to others through
food?

804
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,399
When l see you going back to the village,

805
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,159
l can tell you finally figured it out.

806
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,160
Thank you.

807
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,559
l must thank you indeed.

808
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,919
lf you didn't teach them whole-heartedly,

809
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,920
We can't enter the final race.

810
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,520
lt's all because they are talented.

811
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,760
Ken, thank you.

812
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,200
l am so sleepy...

813
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,680
Don't sleep, l have many places to go with you.

814
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,120
l have so many things to do with...

815
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,040
Why happiness is so short?

816
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,120
Because...

817
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,560
People have many unhappy times.

818
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:21,520
Ah Yee!

819
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,920
You're something!

820
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,840
Sit down.

821
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,159
What do you want?

822
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,039
Nothing, l just come to see you.

823
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,519
lsn't it too late?

824
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,319
Not late at all.

825
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,320
lf you are a bit late, you will not see him.

826
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,840
Cut the crap, you're not welcomed.

827
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,599
l am your nephew, l came specially to see you.

828
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,479
Why don't you want to see me?

829
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,480
l think l am not heartless.

830
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,520
Uncle, your student wounded my fellows.

831
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,079
He should pay for it, right?

832
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,080
You know pretty well for what you did.

833
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,280
What?

834
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,960
You kicked my father away for the Dragon
Head's Blade.

835
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,719
Now, you want to take my cup for the Best
Chef away?

836
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,720
This should be what l told you.

837
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,200
Your uncle did nothing wrong.

838
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,399
Stop!

839
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,839
No matter you believe it or not.

840
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,119
Your father has his reason to leave.

841
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,120
Okay, l have my reason to...

842
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,920
Fix that bastard and the bitch.

843
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,599
This is between us, there is nothing to do with
them.

844
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,600
Yeah.

845
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,999
l don't want to do anything to them.

846
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
l just bring you some present.

847
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,759
Leung.

848
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,919
Master Joe, why not leave him alone?

849
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,920
l don't want to repeat.

850
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:51,040
Well, my fellows accidentally locked up your
student,

851
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,440
And a young girl inside the freezer.

852
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,160
And they accidentally locked up the door.

853
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,399
But don't worry.

854
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,400
l've kept the key for you, do you want it?

855
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,480
l am sorry, l failed to hold it.

856
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,920
The key is inside, take it or leave it.

857
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,800
You can take time to consider it, but they just
can't wait too long.

858
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,200
l've got no choice.

859
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,999
No!

860
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
That key is not the true one.

861
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,400
l've got the right one here.

862
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,800
Come on, it's over.

863
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,480
Thank you.

864
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,520
Master Joe has lost control, please take care.

865
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,040
Take care.

866
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,999
The next Best Chef will be found soon.

867
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,279
The theme of this final race is...

868
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,359
Soup.

869
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,319
The Chinese always need soup in the
banquet.

870
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,320
Other than making soup, the participants must
achieve one more thing.

871
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,159
That is...

872
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,799
Purity.

873
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,800
Sis, what does it mean?

874
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,919
That means, no favour is the best favour.

875
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,920
So the cook cannot add seasoning into the
soup.

876
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,039
ln the arts of cookery,

877
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,040
One way is to cook without seasoning,

878
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,319
it is to let people eat the real taste of the food.

879
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,119
The best cooks of the Shang and Chau
Dynasty,

880
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,919
They integrated the arts of cookery,

881
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,719
With philosophy.

882
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,319
That is ''Purity is the best''.

883
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,320
l can't imagine you'd give up the competition
for that rusty blade.

884
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,679
Do you like this blade?

885
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,559
You really like to be Chief.

886
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,839
Don't blame me of being heartless.

887
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,840
l'll let you be the Chief for one day.

888
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:45,920
l now declare the beginning of the competition.

889
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,960
Ken, what soup should we make?

890
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,200
Why these cabbages be viewed as the best
food?

891
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,080
Cabbages mean a lot to the villagers.

892
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,679
They are like our family.

893
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,119
Normally, you won't feel much.

894
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,120
But when you lose it, you'll feel how much you
love it.

895
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,920
You'll understand it in future.

896
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,839
Kam-lui.

897
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,719
Let's do ''Cabbage in Clear Water''.

898
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,720
Master said, the fame of the ''Best Cook'' isn't
important to him.

899
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,560
Except Sum's Restaurant!

900
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,560
All right, let's do Cabbage in Clear Water.

901
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,480
Master Tin, how can you get these
ingredients...

902
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,040
Preparation is always important to achieve
success.

903
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,279
This dish is named with ''Clear Water'',

904
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,280
it is because the soup is as clear as water.

905
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,440
The method is, mined the chicken,

906
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,680
Then drop them evenly inside the chicken
soup.

907
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,920
When it sinks,

908
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,720
lt'll absorb the remained fats and other
materials.

909
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,920
Kam-lui, give me the cabbages.

910
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,439
This is not normal cabbages.

911
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,440
We must pick the heart of the cabbages.

912
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,800
Then, get some fine needles.

913
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,600
Stab the needles into the leaves to make
numerous fine holds.

914
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,240
But don't ruin the outlook of the cabbages.

915
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,159
Then, add the cooked soup...

916
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,160
into the pot with cabbages.

917
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,400
And then put it into the steamer for steaming.

918
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,920
What is it about?

919
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,360
For traditional method, only the bottom is
heated.

920
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,239
All the heat comes from the bottom.

921
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,240
Now, he uses this device,

922
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,520
So it will receive heat evenly all over the pot.

923
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,240
When it is opened, even the Buddha is
attracted to jump over the wall for it.

924
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,199
''Buddha jumps the wall'', it is absolutely the
best soup of the world.

925
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,200
''Cabbage in Clear Water'' is no match for it.

926
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,560
Wait.

927
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,720
Make it a signature dish of Sum's Restaurant.

928
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,920
Sis, that's my bean cube.

929
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,840
Dragon Head's Blade.

930
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,320
How come the bean cube disappeared?

931
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,360
Why the Szechwan cook view this as
treasure?

932
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,240
To make great food with some cheap and
common ingredients,

933
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,599
lt is the top level of cookery.

934
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,600
And it implies the top level of life performance.

935
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,599
This is the real taste of food.

936
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,600
Purity!

937
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,679
The result is,

938
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:43,680
Ken Lung from Sum's Restaurant is the new
Best Cook of China.

939
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,360
Bravo! Wonderful!

940
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,520
Brother.

941
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,040
Since you have come, why not have a sip?

942
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,280
This is the taste of cabbage.

943
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,319
Who is he?

944
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,399

01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,799

So you must be Sum Ying.

949

Sis, is he...

950
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,880
He is our father's student, Master Wong
Ping-kei.

951
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,440
Dad...

952
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,799
Dad, please don't leave.

953
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,800
Dad...

954
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,560
l did it wrong!

955
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,400
Ken, my brother and l think that you're the best
one to have this blade.

956
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,559
We hope you can make good food with it.

01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,560
To give happiness to the world!

01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,839
Ying, l'm leaving tomorrow.

959
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,599
Didn't expect you to leave so soon.

960

964
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,880
Don't be upset, okay?

965
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,600

You make great beancurd.

Why makes you learn cooking skills from
Wong?

969
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,280
Master is a great cook, it's really your luck to
learn cookery from him.

Look at you! You're so handsome!

You have rosy cheeks!

976
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,319
l am sure you don't have female students in
school.

977
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,320
Haven't you been touched by women?

978
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,400
So what?

979
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,559
No matter you're not gentleman like.

You don't understand girls at all!

983
