1
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,875
Uncle Yee, I want an ultraman.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,916
But I want the lemon flavor. Sure.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,113
That's all right.

4
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,440
Keung, where are you? Thank you, Uncle
Yee.

5
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,389
It's over done!.

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,829
Leung.

7
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,989
Chief, what's the matter?

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,680
See? The pork is over done.

9
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,474
Pork is the star of this dish.

10
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,792
I... I Just went to toilet for a while, so...

11
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,154
It's ridiculous!

12
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,232
You're not in the mood all the day, see? You
caused trouble at last.

13
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,790
What's the matter with you?

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,713
There is only half hour to the banquet.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,838
Now, the pork is over done.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,831
Can we serve without pork in the pot?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,877
What we can do now is to use the "Blade".

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,593
The 5th descendant of the Dragon Head
Blade, Wong Ping-yee,

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,272
I'd like to borrow the Blade now.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,351
With the unification of the blade, we'll do it
righteous and filial.

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,156
Ah Yee borrows the Blade.

22
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,748
The Chief is holding the Dragon Head's Blade.

23
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,639
What is it for?

24
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,799
Why did he take out the Blade?

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,718
This is my first time to view it.

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,358
Wah, this is my first time to view this Blade.

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
Don't block my way; I want to see how
wonderful it is.

28
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,472
Woo, it's really wonderful!

29
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,152
Uncle Two, you can tell the guests that...

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,355
The banquet will be on time.

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,750
So, I'll count on you to make us some tasty
pork.

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,397
Sure, no problem.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,313
This is a red pocket for you, for working
smooth.

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,355
Thank you, Uncle.

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,113
Okay, the banquet will be started on time.
Come on, help me to serve.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,397
We wish you happy birthday! Thank you.

37
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,510
We wish you happy birthday!

38
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,468
Come on, cheers...

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,473
Cheers!

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,399
It smells so good!

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,234
Give me the salt.

42
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,150
Here it is.

43
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,355
It's done!

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,351
Eat more! Come on, enJoy your food.

45
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,351
Come on, come...

46
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,875
Take it to that table, and that table, too.

47
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,191
Eat more! Come on... Come on

48
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,957
If Master Joe was here, we wouldn't have been
that messy.

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,831
Even he is willing to help, I won't let him do it.

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,397
I promised my brother to let his son achieve
great success.

51
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,517
But he is still a cook out there.

52
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,874
Tidy up now.

53
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,478
Chief, oh no! What a trouble!

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,558
Why did you do that?

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,150
Don't let him go!

56
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,276
He is the cook! He intended to poison us!

57
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,476
He should not be the Chief of our village.
Dare you want to go?

58
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,758
Who asked you to do so?

59
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,518
It's Master Joe.

60
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,432
Wong Ping-yee, since you borrowed the
Blade,

61
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,839
You must be responsible.

62
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,560
Wong, you are not qualified to be a cook.

63
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,119
I was being set up!

64
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,553
Did I misunderstand you?

65
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,710
You cooked the pork.

66
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,031
Yee, you don't deserve to have the Blade.

67
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,678
Master Joe is the man behind...

68
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,513
I decided to expel Wong Ping-yee.

69
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,798
Wong Kai-Joe will substitute him for a while.

70
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,119
Tai-tung Martial Arts

71
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,154
Students, before your graduation,

72
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,069
Let's see who can put the emblem of the
school...

73
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,191
Back to its original place.

74
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,677
The one who can do it will be...

75
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,473
The first honored graduate of the school.

76
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,559
On your mark...

77
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,068
Get set...

78
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,519
Go!

79
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,189
It is with him!

80
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,232
Go after him!

81
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,995
Are you kidding me?

82
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,795
It is with the principal.

83
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,397
Don't come to me...

84
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,833
Respect your principal!

85
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,396
Who wants to be the first honored graduate?

86
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,914
Move!

87
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,830
Are you serious?

88
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,512
I don't have it, it's not with me...

89
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,718
I passed it to Ken'ichi.

90
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,837
It is with Ken'ichi.

91
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,308
Where is it? Where is it?

92
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,879
Principal, who did you give it to?

93
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,270
I... I gave it to that Jerk! Where is he
now?

94
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,359
You bastard!

95
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,354
Pal, thank you.

96
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,712
Has Ken'ichi left?

97
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,239
I am asking you.

98
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,955
Has Ken'ichi left?

99
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,913
I think he has Just left, maybe, perhaps, I think
so...

100
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,512
It's nonsense to ask you.

101
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,552
I'll go after him.

102
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,393
You don't need to.

103
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,835
He asked me to give you this box before he
left.

104
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,395
How dare he fool the principal!

105
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,394
Watch out, it's breaking!

106
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,878
It's school property.

107
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,276
Principal, I have to leave now.

108
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,399
Politeness, Justice, honesty and honor,
patience and self control.

109
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,118
I will never forget what you have taught me.

110
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,713
I made you these noodles.

111
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,600
This is Just a token from me.

112
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,829
It's very kind of you.

113
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,595
Rise.

114
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,758
After leaving the school,

115
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,957
go to this place to look for master Sum
Wai-tak.

116
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,036
What for?

117
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,871
From this great master, you can learn what
you're lacking for.

118
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,831
The principles of gourmandism are: color,
smell, taste, conception and appearance.

119
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,036
Ken has cooking talent.

120
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,712
But he doesn't know much about the idea of
food.

121
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,757
However, we cannot teach the conception of
food.

122
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,673
He must figure it out in his life.

123
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,156
If he can match himself with food, then, he can
make it.

124
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,440
Although Ken isn't a local student,

125
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,479
He has strong passion on Chinese cookery.

126
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,356
After some time, I am sure...

127
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,669
He can become a great cook.

128
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,948
Sis, do you think the smell of tea can distract
me?

129
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,355
Please wait!

130
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,750
Forget it, Ching,

131
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,996
I am sure you can't get it Just by smelling.

132
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,636
We should get ready for servicing now.

133
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,155
Come on, Just say you can't make it.

134
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,034
Kam-lui, I told you, remember?

135
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,714
I want to serve our guests nutritious soup,

136
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,116
But not this kind of mixture.

137
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,235
You can smell it, can't you?

138
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,598
This seems to be a nutritious soup,

139
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,749
But actually, it is medicine instead of soup.

140
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,509
Take it away.

141
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,118
I tried so much time and effort for it.

142
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,637
What a pity that you still miss something.

143
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,073
I have already helped you.

144
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,388
But my sister is really great!

145
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,995
Kam-lui, what is this black stuff?

146
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,275
It's disgusting! Take it away please.

147
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,395
Take it away!

148
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,914
My sister is really great!

149
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,358
Have the goods we ordered been delivered?

150
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,754
I am now going to check it.

151
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,518
What's wrong with you?

152
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,316
Come and give me a hand.

153
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,957
All right.

154
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,236
Let me help you.

155
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,195
Thank you.

156
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,030
You're welcome.

157
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,999
Are you kidding? You messed up everything!

158
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,115
I am sorry...

159
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,634
If any of it breaks, I'll cut the bill, you got it?

160
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,509
Oh my head...

161
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,635
It hurts!

162
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,709
What are you looking at?

163
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,395
Move those stuffs inside, hurry up!

164
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,869
No, l...

165
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,394
I'll check the bill later, but I must check the
goods first.

166
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,835
If any breaks, I won't pay the bill.

167
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,195
If one is rotten, I'll deduct two dollars, and so
on.

168
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,192
Move now! Hurry up!

169
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,674
You too, move those near the door way first.

170
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,948
Excuse me, sir...

171
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,433
Do you want to eat in?

172
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,630
This way please.

173
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,229
What did you say?

174
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,515
I said...

175
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,559
First, I am not a coolie.

176
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,154
Second, I didn't mean to hurt you.

177
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,674
Third, I came here for Master Sum.

178
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,954
The forth thing is...

179
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,118
I am really hungry.

180
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,349
Why didn't you voice out?

181
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,836
Did you give me a chance?

182
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,669
I'll make you pay for hurting my head later.

183
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,393
Please wait for me right here for a minute.

184
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,435
Since our shop has Just been in service,

185
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,033
If you don't mind, please sit inside.

186
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,116
It's all right.

187
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,199
You want to see Master Sum?

188
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,475
So, you must tell me what ingredients are put
inside the soup.

189
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,074
Sis.

190
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,239
Thank you.

191
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,795
The water from three rivers.

192
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,190
So, you are a gourmet!

193
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,709
I Just know something about food.

194
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,113
Did you make this Pu-er tea with old tangerine
peel?

195
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,752
How did you know it?

196
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,637
Old orange peel is as precious as old ginseng.

197
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,315
To mix tangerine peel with old Pu-er tea,

198
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,233
It is the best drink to quench thirst and helps
good digestion.

199
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,037
You know much about tea.

200
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,271
However, our food is even better than this tea.

201
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,595
I am sure you have never tried that before.

202
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,629
What do you want to order, sir?

203
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,358
What is the signature dish of your restaurant?

204
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,195
All are signature dishes, you can order
anything you'd like to eat.

205
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,119
"Cabbage in clear water" please.

206
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,475
"Cabbage in Clear Water"?

207
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,155
So, is it steamed or boiled?

208
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,993
Mind your tongue! That is the famous
Szechwan dish.

209
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,308
Although this is a Cantonese restaurant,

210
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,073
Since you order it, we'll get it ready for you.

211
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,433
Have you figured it out?

212
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,469
Are you kidding me? This tastes like medicine.

213
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,479
But I know there is something special inside.

214
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,796
This is a soup with 3 snakes and a turtle.

215
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,276
I can't imagine that you're really great!

216
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,114
So, do you know how to make "Cabbage in
clear water"?

217
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,592
I am a cook,

218
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,830
Sure I know how to make such simple dish.

219
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,553
One for me please.

220
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,953
Master, why does he order Szechwan food in a
Cantonese restaurant?

221
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,838
It's weird.

222
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,713
I think this is a cook too.

223
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,150
He wants to try me with that special dish.

224
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,755
Luckily I am not nobody.

225
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,678
Bro, there is Just cabbage and soup,

226
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,478
Why people view this as the greatest dish of
all?

227
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,952
Yee, for we villagers, cabbage has special
meaning.

228
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,918
It is like our family.

229
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,151
Normally, we won't pay special attention to it,

230
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,999
However, when we lose it, we will miss it.

231
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,914
You'll understand the warmth and love of it in
future.

232
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,714
Check please.

233
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,313
Sir, is there any problem with our cabbage?

234
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,999
Be frank...

235
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,588
This is far beyond standard.

236
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,473
I don't understand what you mean...

237
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,392
The cabbage and chicken are not bad.

238
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,518
But the process is wrong.

239
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,268
The cabbage you made here...

240
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,191
Any cook can make it.

241
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,116
The original one has not been found for ages.

242
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,748
May I know your name?

243
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,159
Wong Ping-yee.

244
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,071
Master Wong, if you are a great cook,

245
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,309
Dare you compete with me?

246
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,515
What if we lose,

247
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,433
I will leave this restaurant forever.

248
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,353
If you lose, please wash dishes here for a
year.

249
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,597
Why should I compete with you?

250
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,593
As a cook, you have no reason to reJect me.

251
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,229
Okay, but I need an assistant.

252
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,835
I can tell it's done by Master Sum at the first
bite.

253
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,356
It's really tasty!

254
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,832
So soft and spicy, and it's not greasy at all.

255
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,118
This has been the signature dish of our
restaurant.

256
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,471
And, he has a good assistant.

257
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,831
So, to him, this is Just a piece of cake.

258
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,029
Master Wong.

259
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,395
What do you think about his dish?

260
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,195
It's Just fair.

261
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,476
Master Wong, it has been put here for quite a
long time, it's cold.

262
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,231
Watch out!

263
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,990
Sis.

264
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,071
Oh no! Why is it so hot?

265
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,749
What's wrong with it?

266
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,678
Actually, wrapping the skin...

267
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,557
It is a thin layer of sugar.

268
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,073
It is for keeping the duck warm.

269
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,153
Although the duck is put on the table,

270
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,515
Actually, it's still in the process of cooking.

271
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,189
It is very...

272
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,395
What is it?

273
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,835
I lost.

274
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,474
Why?

275
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,830
It is "Wu-Jo's 8 Treasure duck", not any cook
has ever made it for century.

276
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,679
I can't imagine that...

277
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,714
It tastes like what it is written in the cook book.

278
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,511
To make this dish, we can't use knife.

279
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,714
Not any knife should be used.

280
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,078
Duck's meat is hard to handle, once it is in
touch with knife,

281
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,234
The tissue will go hard and still, and the fibres
will break.

282
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,230
Don't stop him.

283
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,878
I know very well about Master Sum.

284
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,871
After leaving school, go to this place for
Master Sum Wai-tak.

285
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,430
By the way, he always wants to leave.

286
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,033
Master Sum Wai-tak, please wait. What
did you say?

287
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,235
Sum Wai-tak?

288
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,433
Right, Sum Wai-tak is my father.

289
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,949
However...

290
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,229
He passed away last year.

291
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,832
Sum Wai-tak was my brother's master, too.

292
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,716
I know.

293
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,350
When I tasted the duck,

294
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,998
I knew who you are.

295
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,593
So, about my story...

296
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,639
Master Wong, I heard something about you
before.

297
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,512
I believe that you're innocent.

298
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,233
Why?

299
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,989
It's basic instinct.

300
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,510
A cook who loves cooking will never do that.

301
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,830
Have some tea please.

302
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,110
Thank you.

303
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,428
Master Sum left.

304
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,317
We have no cook now.

305
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,593
I Just know following cook book.

306
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,312
And my sister doesn't want to be a cook, too.

307
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,352
If this goes on, our restaurant...

308
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,790
It will be closed sooner or later.

309
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,516
And this family business will...

310
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,357
My brother adopted your father's cooking
skills,

311
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,954
And I adopted cooking skills from my brother.

312
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,237
So, I am obliged to help maintain the fame of
"Sum's restaurant".

313
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,070
But I Just can't do it alone.

314
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,954
Master Wong, do you want...

315
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,998
The young man I Just saw is smart.

316
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,918
He is Just a little bit arrogant.

317
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,713
If he is well trained,

318
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,514
sure he will become great.

319
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,517
But he may not stay.

320
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,108
I believe that he will.

321
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,914
But under one condition.

322
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,433
Please go ahead.

323
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,109
Never call me Master Wong again.

324
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,555
Call me Ah Yee.

325
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,670
All right, Ah Yee.

326
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,075
I want to challenge you!

327
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,674
What do you want to compete with me?

328
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,110
Cutting skills.

329
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,958
I am sorry...

330
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,993
He knows how to cut a globe fish!

331
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,196
No matter why he wants to compete with
cutting skills.

332
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,117
To cut a globe fish, the cook must be quick
and sharp.

333
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,919
There are many thorny things on the skin of
the fish.

334
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,878
You can cut it with the knife.

335
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,753
But it's really difficult.

336
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,476
That's why it can test the cutting skill of a
cook.

337
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,629
Finished.

338
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,719
This is the sliced globe fish.

339
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,633
If you have worries, so...

340
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,549
you can eat it half hour later.

341
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,431
I can't smell the stink of fish but tastes it so
sweet and fine.

342
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,351
It's neither like fish nor meat.

343
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,953
This is the top level of eating globe fish!

344
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,716
It's okay, it's my turn now.

345
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,830
The Japanese take bream as the king of fish.

346
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,194
Its taste is elegant and subtle.

347
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,918
But comparing with globe fish...

348
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,436
This is cold slice of bream.

349
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,712
It doesn't seem to be special.

350
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,597
No matter how skillful is Yee,

351
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,353
how can the taste of bream be better than
globe fish?

352
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,030
You...

353
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,555
What knife did you use?

354
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,353
The knife was cold.

355
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,799
The meaning of "Sushi",

356
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,952
that is to keep the fish at a cool stage.

357
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,236
So, the fish will be tasty.

358
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,752
After the sudden cold feeling,

359
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,832
the temperature inside the mouth mixes with
the tasty fish,

360
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,912
it is stirred inside the mouth and spread
outwards.

361
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,038
The frozen bream seems to have rebirth!

362
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,554
This is the best taste of all.

363
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,675
I am not the loser.

364
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,398
I failed to have a better knife.

365
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,758
You're really great.

366
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,436
Actually, this is the secret of cutting skills.

367
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,320
Who messed up with my sauce?

368
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,152
Why are all the carrots gone?

369
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,953
The money for paying the vegetables...

370
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,994
I have to pay the supplier now...

371
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,555
All right, don't cry please.

372
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,553
I have got it ready.

373
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,911
Come on, you cry whenever you get the money
for paying vegetables!

374
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,996
Eight thousand...

375
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,636
Your order please.

376
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,919
Who told you to delivery these things to us?

377
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,438
This is the order of Mr. Wong.

378
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,839
Thank you. Thank you.

379
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,676
Whose stuff is it?

380
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,560
To make tangerine sauce, using pineapple
Juice is okay.

381
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,551
But you must add chrysanthemum and
iquorice.

382
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,200
With a green root and tastes hot,

383
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,918
you can't say it a radish.

384
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,149
From Wong Ping-yee.

385
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,275
He must have done something to my sauce.

386
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,190
He has gone too far!

387
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,350
Master...

388
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,035
Don't greet me master, I haven't promised to
be your master yet.

389
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,356
Master, come on!

390
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,954
I'll do anything you tell me.

391
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,836
When heaven wants someone to do
something big,

392
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,150
first, the guy will be bitterly trained.

393
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,310
He will be hungry and tired,

394
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,752
he will be trained to be calm and mild.

395
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,398
So he will gain strength from his training.

396
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,279
Are you sick?

397
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,830
You didn't sleep but sharpen the knife in the
middle of the night.

398
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,433
And you made it till dawn!

399
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,033
Will you let others sleep?

400
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,839
I can't imagine that, you're not only selfish,

401
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,951
but also deaf!

402
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,830
You're sick!

403
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,434
What do you want?

404
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,837
Do you think you're acting horror film?

405
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,760
Who do you want to scare with these knives?

406
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,031
You know? You made sounds all night,

407
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,348
I Just couldn't sleep all night.

408
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,152
Are you crazy?

409
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,238
Are you sick?

410
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,071
Why don't you go for medication?

411
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,755
Master.

412
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,869
I've already done with the rusted knives.

413
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,435
So, we...

414
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,194
When can we start?

415
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,716
Start what?

416
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,433
Of course, you teach me cooking.

417
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,229
What else do you think?

418
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,794
Since this is sharpened by you, you'll use it.

419
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,668
What?

420
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,193
Didn't you hear it clear?

421
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,478
I...

422
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,678
When will you teach me cooking?

423
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,836
So boring!

424
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,237
Peel it, there are some baskets waiting for you

425
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,189
Master, l...

426
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,349
Ah Yee.

427
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,559
Tomorrow is the first day you become the
chef,

428
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,919
this is your uniform.

429
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,430
Thank you.

430
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,235
Yee, what is bothering you?

431
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,793
I am worrying about my nephew.

432
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,389
Silky cake.

433
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,795

BBQ goose.

440
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,875
Greatest mouths of all.

441
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,313
Curry seafood.

442
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,153

00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,753

World's selection of Sushi.

446
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,233
Treasure of the world... Wait.

447
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,595
Master Joe.

448
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,877
This is the newly designed menu for the new
shop, are you satisfied with it?

449
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,516
Just follow your idea. Dismiss.

450
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,634
Master, this is the new chef I hired for the new
branch.

451
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,075
Master Sum.

452
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,433
Where did you work before?

453
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,675
Sum's Restaurant.

454
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,196
So, why do you want to work in the King of
Cantonese Restaurant?

455
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,588
Master Joe, actually, I always wish...

456
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,829
to work in such a big group.

457
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,433
I want the truth.

458
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,193
The reason is...

459
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,071
I... I made a small mistake in a cooking race.

460
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,989
I was defeated by one persons, so...

461
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,556
Master Sum is quite famous in this field.

462
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,228
What is that guy? What cook can defeat you?

463
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,755
That guy is named...

464
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,795
Wong Ping-yee.

465
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,869
Pardon?

466
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,639
He is named Wong Ping-yee.

467
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,549
Wong Ping-yee.

468
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,593
I won't be merciful this time.

469
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,318
Master Joe, but the Chief has left the village
for ages.

470
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,032
Are you on his side?

471
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,155
I am not! You called him Chief?

472
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,229
What I mean is...

473
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,878
I mean, you are his nephew...

474
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,949
Actually, it's nonsense.,, He has nothing
to do with me.

475
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,678
Why do you treat him as your foe?

476
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,239
Right? Listen to me... Stop!

477
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,275
Shut up!

478
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,591
He stole the Dragon Head Blade, he hurt my
father.

479
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,116
At that time, did he remember that's his
brother?

480
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,029
Give it back to me!

481
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,395
Give it back to me!

482
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,749
Give it back to me!

483
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,679
Give it back to me!

484
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,236
Give it back to me... Give it back to me...

485
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,558
Brother, stay calm please.

486
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,790
Why?

487
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,838
That blade is mine!

488
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,839
I am the Best Chef of the World!

489
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,514
You have no right to hide the blade.

490
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,634
I don't need this.

491
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,030
I want the Dragon Head Blade!

492
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,030
Where is mine? Where is my Dragon Head
Blade?

493
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,680
Give it back to me!

494
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,070
He always wants that blade and to be the
Chief of the Village.

495
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,158
Wake up please!

496
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,435
Bro, drink no more!

497
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,556
At the most critical moment...

498
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,430
Ah Yee!

499
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,830
Brother!

500
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,829
I witnessed it.

501
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,875
It's him...

502
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,638
He set a trap for my dad.

503
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,035
My brother got hurt because of saving me.

504
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,349
It hurts!

505
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,714
My father can no longer be a cook, all because
of him.

506
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,553
He left the village.

507
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,476
Bro!

508
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,075
Stop it, I have no face to stay any longer.

509
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,436
Please take care of Joe for me.

510
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,198
I promised my brother to take good care of
Joe, God knows that...

511
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,634
He forced by me to leave the village.

512
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,709
It's a revenge.

513
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,913
How can he do this to you?

514
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,716
Forget it.

515
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,957
Let bygones be bygones.

516
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,919
In fact, your brother...

517
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,513
Won the championship of the World's Best
Chef for 2 consecutive years.

518
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,434
He gained much fame for us.

519
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,356
My brother is really a genius.

520
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,470
Wrong.

521
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,836
Wrong!

522
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,074
Wrong!

523
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,276
Cutting skills is easy to learn but it needs non
stop practice.

524
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,072
For common people, they Just need to cut
sharp.

525
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,436
If a cook has better skills,

526
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,796
He can handle chopping, hitting, mashing and
slashing well.

527
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,190
That's already good skills.

528
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,388
But if he wants to be a good cook,

529
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,199
Different ingredients need different kinds of
cutting skills.

530
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,919
So, it'll take much time for real practice.

531
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,953
Is it really that bad?

532
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,234
I did it purposely for you.

533
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,956
Thank you.

534
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,150
I worked for one whole day.

535
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,429
I already said thank you.

536
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,752
Don't be cocky!

537
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,517
Other than being fresh, to make great food,

538
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,556
We need great sauce to mix with it.

539
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,875
Saucing is the soul of a dish.

540
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,598
But different people have different taste.

541
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,399
But you will get bored for eating same good
food everyday.

542
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,835
So, all good cook can make good sauce.

543
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,515
Try it.

544
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,078
Ying, why the sauce you made...

545
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,398
are of the same taste?

546
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,835
I think so.

547
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,631
Kam-lui.

548
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,837
Actually it's easy to make sauce.

549
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,631
You Just need a little patience.

550
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,678
And some interest.

551
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,675
And some imagination.

552
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,395
There are few kinds of taste, sweet, sour,
bitter, hot and salty.

553
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,079
Just keep on trying.

554
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,355
Mix with different ingredients.

555
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,354
Then find out the best choice of the guests,
that's all.

556
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,471
Is it tasty, Kam-lui?

557
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,309
It is sweet and salty.

558
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,595
But I can taste sweet and hot at the same
time, it's great!

559
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,718
How did you make it?

560
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,954
I haven't tried such special sauce before.

561
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,511
Kam-lui, let's use this sauce today.

562
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,033
Keep it well in the kitchen.

563
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,473
Be careful. I got it.

564
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,357
Kam-lui, I'll go with you. All right.

565
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,553
Ying, what are you thinking?

566
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,231
I am thinking of a way to make some delicious
bean cube pudding.

567
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,033
You want to make bean cube pudding?

568
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,789
Greet me Master, then I'll teach you.

569
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,599
But I want the most delicious one.

570
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,237
No problem.

571
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:19,957
Master!

572
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,759
The ingredients for making bean cube pudding
is simple.

573
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,229
Soy beans, water and some substance for
solidification.

574
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,315
The proportion of soy beans and water may
differ.

575
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,438
Today, I'll teach you frying.

576
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,318
For fried eggs, we love it to be smooth, soft
and with good smell.

577
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,833
But how to make it smooth?

578
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,150
The key point is to let air enter the eggs.

579
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,229
Bubble it.

580
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,835
This shares the same theory of making
spongy cakes.

581
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,638
I'll show you.

582
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,837
Then, you'll count on yourself.

583
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,237
The key point is to control the temperature of
the oil.

584
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,908
Just one word, don't use boiled oil.

585
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,558
If so, the eggs will be over done.

586
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,117
Come on.

587
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,355
Master, it is not done yet.

588
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,192
Yes, it is to use the remained heat to make it
all done.

589
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,633
So, the eggs will be smooth.

590
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,599
Other than skills of frying,

591
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,559
You need to pay attention to breaking the
eggs.

592
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,358
And, most important of all is to control the
heat.

593
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,428
It is simple to talk, but it is really difficult.

594
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,072
This is named "Wong Po thousand layers of
egg".

595
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,915
Fried egg is Just a simple dish.

596
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,438
But it is really something interesting!

597
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,715
More simple the dish is, more difficulty to be
handled.

598
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,672
It's really hard to cook great dish.

599
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,789
No. it is not hard to cook well.

600
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,399
It's really hard to perform well in life.

601
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,351
Chicken pot, please. EnJoy please.

602
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,034
Move now.

603
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,037
This is the home made sauce.

604
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,590
This is newly made, hope you all like it.

605
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,470
Boss.

606
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,629
What is it about?

607
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,710
What is it?

608
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,710
What is it?

609
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,275
This is...

610
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,276
Obviously, it is a nail.

611
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,713
Nail?

612
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,109
Can you get it? It is a nail.

613
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,438
There are some nails in the pot, it can kill.

614
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,710
Oh no!

615
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,116
Don't get nervous, it's Just a
misunderstanding.

616
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:32,837
Kam-lui.

617
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,709
What's the matter?

618
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,869
Take a look at yourself.

619
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,788
It is so sharp!

620
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,719
I don't mind nails, but I want it cooked well.

621
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,199
It's not steak, I don't want it raw.

622
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,279
I don't eat half done nails.

623
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,395
Do you want to kill me?

624
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,435
What do you want?

625
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,795
You've gone too far!

626
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,838
If you want to mess up, you must use better
trick.

627
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,196
How can you add so many nails into the pot at
the same time?

628
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,396
On one would be so stupid to cook like this.
This is a set up.

629
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,708
It's hard to say!

630
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,598
There was precedent from your chef.

631
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,356
What did you say?

632
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,795
Wong Ping-yee, this is the present from
Master Joe.

633
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,315
Don't worry.

634
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,837
This is the pork done by Chef Tin, no problem.

635
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,073
You'd better watch out.

636
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,909
Why?

637
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,069
What does that mean?

638
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,876
I can't imagine our business would become
this worse.

639
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,949
Don't panic.

640
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,678
Why not?

641
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,631
Now, we have no customers to come.

642
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,276
If this goes on, our restaurant will be closed.

643
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,519
Who brought this bad luck to us, huh?

644
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,199
Brother Choi, are you here for shopping?

645
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,909
Let me handle it.

646
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,118
We'd better not talk behind someone.

647
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,788
Don't mess up.

648
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,198
I don't want to be bullied but say nothing.

649
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,277
Bitch! You're looking for trouble!

650
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,149
What's up?

651
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,911
Get lost!

652
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:29,876
Stop!

653
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,515
So? Be a hero?

654
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,035
Go!

655
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,349
What's up?

656
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,114
Run!

657
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,592
Stop! Freeze!

658
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,950
Freeze!

659
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,390
Stay where you are!

660
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,708
Freeze! Stay where you are!

661
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,478
What do you want?

662
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,390
No, thanks.

663
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,316
Disgusting! Why did you stop me?

664
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,993
Look, you have flour all over your face.

665
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,518
Come and Join the 7th competition for the
"Best Cook of China".

666
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,915

Let's hurry back to tell sister about this.

671
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,230
My dad is the best cook, he is the best of the
best.

672
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,037
I can win the cup easily.

673
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,914
No one can compete with me.

674
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,233
I want a revenge.

675
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:05,956
Hello...

676
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,548
Okay, I'll wait for you.

677
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,071
Sorry, I can't go.

678
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,197
Yes, what's the matter?

679
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,391
Master, please tell us.

680
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,594
Sister and I take you as our family.

681
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,518
We can help you!

682
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,551
This matter bothers me for a long time, I must
settle it.

683
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,758
Master, if you don't go,

684
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,270
we won't go too.

685
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,231
Ken, this is a very important competition.

686
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,591
What is more important than the competition?

687
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,710
Yes!

688
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,597
It's you and this restaurant.

689
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,630
I don't care the name of being the best cook.

690
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,152
For the restaurant, you must try hard in the
competition.

691
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,195
Don't worry, we'll wait for you.

692
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,552
Ken...

693
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,468

Hi

710
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,350
Master.

711
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,553
Is he still your master?

712
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,676
Kam-lui.

713
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,508
He is no longer your master.

714
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,433
Fatty,

715
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,432
I want to challenge you.

716
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,910
Fine, where are you from?

Sum's Restaurant.

718
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,437
Now, I have to tell you the rules.

719
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,714
This is a knockout.

720
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,156
The Judgment team will pick two teams among

They will have the final race in next time.

722
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,077
Now, the theme is knife.

723
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,675
In that case, other than the outlook and taste,

724
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,716
The chef must express the skills of cutting.

725
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,075
The cutting skill is a must of a real chef.

726
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,559
You'll have one hour for competition.

727
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,835
Now, I declare the race begins.

728
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,515
I want to cook Szechwan's style of Ox head.

729
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,798
I understand what my master means.

730
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,632
Kam-lui, we must win.

731
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,596
Let's charge up.

732
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,198
But what should we do?

733
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,999
They are all picking ingredients.

734
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,600
Sis, what should we do?

735
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,154
Let's go "The Four Stuffed Treasures".

736
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,036
The Four Stuffed Treasures"?

737
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,478
It's more complicated than "Eight Treasure
Duck".

738
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,518
Don't you have confidence in your cutting
skills?

739
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,309
I got it.

740
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,710
I'll get the chicken, duck, pigeon and the
fillings.

741
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,829
And quail too.

742
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:33,470
Sis, what is Tin doing?

743
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,637
This is the famous dish of Szechwan.

744
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,910
It pays much attention in cutting.

745
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,632
The competition is truly excited.

746
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,119
Now, we have only...

747
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,236
Three minutes left.

748
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,034
Now, we have only...

749
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:30,916
One minute.

750
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,309
Five.

751
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,796
Four.

752
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,516
Three.

753
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,230
Two.

754
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,350
Time's up.

755
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,553
The six dishes are...

756
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,949
Grapes and Fish from Wah Shun Hotel.

757
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,675
Clams in chicken soup from Chai-tai
Restaurant.

758
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,432
Golden Ox and Duck, from Wan's Restaurant.

759
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,518
Phoenix's tail and peach blossom from
Grandma's Restaurant.

760
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,398
Four Stuffed Treasures from Sum's
Restaurant.

761
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,591
Szechwan's Ox Head from the King of
Cantonese Restaurant.

762
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,795
Judges,

763
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,952
What a headache!

764
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,514
The fish and the clams...

765
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,480
The cutting skills and procedures are all right.

766
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,198
But they picked wrong ingredients.

767
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,630
About the duck,

768
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,071
It tastes well and spicy, it looks good too.

769
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,233
However, when it is peeled,

770
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,789
the body of the duck was broken.

771
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,636
And the dish from Grandma's Restaurant, the
prawns are fresh,

772
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,073
The outlook is nice too.

773
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,113
But the strong taste of wine...

774
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,394
Just covers the taste of prawns.

775
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,436
For the Four Stuffed Treasures,

776
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,430
The cutting skills are excellent.

777
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,830
The quail is in the pigeon, then in the chicken,

778
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,549
And finally inside the duck.

779
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,915
It's a mixture of meat

780
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,194
It's really wonderful.

781
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,439
About the Ox Head, it's really a master piece.

782
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,914
It's a difficult task indeed.

783
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,235
From the cutting skills and the choice of
ingredients, it's of the top level.

784
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,311
This ox-head is really wonderful.

785
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,356
Now the Judges are having the final Judgment.

786
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,080
The two final teams will be announced soon,
they are...

787
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,913
Ken from the Sum's Restaurant and Tin from
the King of Cantonese Restaurant.

788
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,716
Congratulations!

789
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,509
We have made it!

790
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,519
I wish Master was here with us.

791
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,395
Master, we can enter the final race.

792
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,190
But the other team is...

793
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:54,996
The Sum's Restaurant.

794
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,829
Master Joe, don't worry.

795
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,679
I can figure it out.

796
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,356
Let me go.

797
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,515
Ken...

798
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,750
Come and fight with me if you're a man.

799
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,914
Ken, watch out!

800
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,469
Ken.

801
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,436
Nice food can make people happy.

802
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,035
But if the chef isn't happy,

803
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,111
How can he pass happiness to others through
food?

804
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,312
When I see you going back to the village,

805
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,197
I can tell you finally figured it out.

806
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,195
Thank you.

807
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:29,749
I must thank you indeed.

808
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,835
If you didn't teach them whole-heartedly,

809
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,239
We can't enter the final race.

810
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,990
It's all because they are talented.

811
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,352
Ken, thank you.

812
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,317
I am so sleepy...

813
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:36,472
Don't sleep, I have many places to go with you.

814
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,873
I have so many things to do with...

815
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,077
Why happiness is so short?

816
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,155
Because...

817
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,792
People have many unhappy times.

818
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,350
Ah Yee!

819
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,035
You're something!

820
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,716
Sit down.

821
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,913
What do you want?

822
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,958
Nothing, I Just come to see you.

823
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,155
Isn't it too late?

824
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,748
Not late at all.

825
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,233
If you are a bit late, you will not see him.

826
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,991
Cut the crap, you're not welcomed.

827
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,519
I am your nephew, I came specially to see you.

828
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,715
Why don't you want to see me?

829
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,040
I think I am not heartless.

830
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,830
Uncle, your student wounded my fellows.

831
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,319
He should pay for it, right?

832
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,355
You know pretty well for what you did.

833
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,269
What?

834
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:54,476
You kicked my father away for the Dragon
Head's Blade.

835
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,156
Now, you want to take my cup for the Best
Chef away?

836
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,598
This should be what I told you.

837
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,679
Your uncle did nothing wrong.

838
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,035
Stop!

839
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,753
No matter you believe it or not.

840
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,796
Your father has his reason to leave.

841
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,829
Okay, I have my reason to...

842
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,069
Fix that bastard and the bitch.

843
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,519
This is between us, there is nothing to do with
them.

844
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,589
Yeah.

845
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,917
I don't want to do anything to them.

846
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,436
I Just bring you some present.

847
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,669
Leung.

848
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,830
Master Joe, why not leave him alone?

849
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,319
I don't want to repeat.

850
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:52,352
Well, my fellows accidentally locked up your
student,

851
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,159
And a young girl inside the freezer.

852
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,232
And they accidentally locked up the door.

853
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,795
But don't worry.

854
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,836
I've kept the key for you, do you want it?

855
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,516
I am sorry, I failed to hold it.

856
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,559
The key is inside, take it or leave it.

857
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,190
You can take time to consider it, but they Just
can't wait too long.

858
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,838
I've got no choice.

859
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,589
No!

860
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,035
That key is not the true one.

861
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,549
I've got the right one here.

862
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,075
Come on, it's over.

863
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,390
Thank you.

864
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,159
Master Joe has lost control, please take care.

865
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:18,756
Take care.

866
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,915
The next Best Chef will be found soon.

867
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,989
The theme of this final race is...

868
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,110
Soup.

869
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,237
The Chinese always need soup in the
banquet.

870
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,551
Other than making soup, the participants must
achieve one more thing.

871
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,436
That is...

872
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,388
Purity.

873
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,394
Sis, what does it mean?

874
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,836
That means, no favour is the best favour.

875
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,390
So the cook cannot add seasoning into the
soup.

876
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,879
In the arts of cookery,

877
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,749
One way is to cook without seasoning,

878
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,956
it is to let people eat the real taste of the food.

879
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,038
The best cooks of the Shang and Chau
Dynasty,

880
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,758
They integrated the arts of cookery,

881
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,354
With philosophy.

882
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:28,153
That is "Purity is the best".

883
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:33,519
I can't imagine you'd give up the competition
for that rusty blade.

884
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,359
Do you like this blade?

885
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,159
You really like to be Chief.

886
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,754
Don't blame me of being heartless.

887
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,115
I'll let you be the Chief for one day.

888
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:45,354
I now declare the beginning of the competition.

889
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,190
Ken, what soup should we make?

890
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:14,637
Why these cabbages be viewed as the best
food?

891
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,471
Cabbages mean a lot to the villagers.

892
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,315
They are like our family.

893
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,432
Normally, you won't feel much.

894
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,556
But when you lose it, you'll feel how much you
love it.

895
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,388
You'll understand it in future.

896
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,434
Kam-lui.

897
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,353
Let's do "Cabbage in Clear Water".

898
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:44,032
Master said, the fame of the "Best Cook" isn't
important to him.

899
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,994
Except Sum's Restaurant!

900
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,994
All right, let's do Cabbage in Clear Water.

901
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,472
Master Tin, how can you get these
ingredients...

902
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,076
Preparation is always important to achieve
success.

903
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,910
This dish is named with "Clear Water",

904
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,272
it is because the soup is as clear as water.

905
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,318
The method is, mined the chicken,

906
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,511
Then drop them evenly inside the chicken
soup.

907
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,037
When it sinks,

908
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,838
It'll absorb the remained fats and other
materials.

909
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,831
Kam-lui, give me the cabbages.

910
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,358
This is not normal cabbages.

911
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,876
We must pick the heart of the cabbages.

912
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,236
Then, get some fine needles.

913
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,990
Stab the needles into the leaves to make
numerous fine holds.

914
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,356
But don't ruin the outlook of the cabbages.

915
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,792
Then, add the cooked soup...

916
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,799
into the pot with cabbages.

917
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,789
And then put it into the steamer for steaming.

918
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,433
What is it about?

919
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,636
For traditional method, only the bottom is
heated.

920
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:37,869
All the heat comes from the bottom.

921
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,915
Now, he uses this device,

922
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,272
So it will receive heat evenly all over the pot.

923
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:37,360
When it is opened, even the Buddha is
attracted to Jump over the wall for it.

924
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,113
"Buddha Jumps the wall", it is absolutely the
best soup of the world.

925
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,476
"Cabbage in Clear Water" is no match for it.

926
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,595
Wait.

927
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,439
Make it a signature dish of Sum's Restaurant.

928
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,595
Sis, that's my bean cube.

929
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,955
Dragon Head's Blade.

930
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,117
How come the bean cube disappeared?

931
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,148
Why the Szechwan cook view this as
treasure?

932
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,949
To make great food with some cheap and
common ingredients,

933
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,508
It is the top level of cookery.

934
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,512
And it implies the top level of life performance.

935
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,400
This is the real taste of food.

936
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,636
Purity!

937
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,589
The result is,

938
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:43,433
Ken Lung from Sum's Restaurant is the new
Best Cook of China.

939
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,828
Bravo! Wonderful!

940
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,635
Brother.

941
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,998
Since you have come, why not have a sip?

942
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,032
This is the taste of cabbage.

943
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,915
Who is he?

944
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,311
We haven't seen for ages, how are you?

945
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,196
I am fine.

946
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,109
Master Wong, how are you doing?

947
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,398
Is she Sum Ching? Right.

948
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,518
So you must be Sum Ying.

949
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,513
Sis, is he...

950
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,111
He is our father's student, Master Wong
Ping-kei.

951
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,270
Dad...

952
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,713
Dad, please don't leave.

953
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,918
Dad...

954
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,278
I did it wrong!

955
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:20,076
Ken, my brother and I think that you're the best
one to have this blade.

956
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,469
We hope you can make good food with it.

957
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,959
To give happiness to the world!

958
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,676
Ying, I'm leaving tomorrow.

959
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,512
Didn't expect you to leave so soon.

960
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,715
This is my dream.

961
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,234
I've something for you.

962
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,469
Just my little token.

963
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,636
Sorry.

964
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,154
Don't be upset, okay?

965
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,831
Ying, I've tasted your effort.

966
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,912
You make great beancurd.

967
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,276
I don't know what sister is thinking.

968
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,874
Why makes you learn cooking skills from
Wong?

969
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,556
Master is a great cook, it's really your luck to
learn cookery from him.

970
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,148
I don't care.

971
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,073
I'll leave this happiness to you!

972
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,268
No laughing.

973
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,954
Look at you! You're so handsome!

974
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,556
Really?

975
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:34,790
You have rosy cheeks!

976
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,238
I am sure you don't have female students in
school.

977
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,833
Haven't you been touched by women?

978
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,435
So what?

979
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,473
No matter you're not gentleman like.

980
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,993
And you are stupid!

981
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,518
You are so dull!

982
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:54,152
You don't understand girls at all!

983
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,592
I Just need to whip up some dishes.

984
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,438
Why must I understand girls?
