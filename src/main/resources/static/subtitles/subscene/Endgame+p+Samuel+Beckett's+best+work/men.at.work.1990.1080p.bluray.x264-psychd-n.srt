2
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,895
I can't support
this activity any longer, Max.

3
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,446
Relax, Jack.

4
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,365
Only two more days and we move
our whole disposal operation north,

5
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,363
out of your jurisdiction.

6
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,447
You promised me those barrels
would be leak proof for 150 years.

7
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,453
Yeah, well.

8
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,295
A slight miscalculation.
Look, it's this simple.

9
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,796
I have an obligation
to produce paint thinner.

10
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,966
You have an obligation
to provide

11
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,264
a place to dispose of the
waste products.

12
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,842
I'm not afraid of you
anymore, Potterdam.

13
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,063
If I have to expose the
whole operation, I will.

14
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,731
I'll bring us all down.

15
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,564
I think you're smarter
than that, Jack.

16
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,150
You can't pay me enough, Max.

17
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,982
You can kiss your chances
of getting elected

18
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,239
mayor goodbye,
Mr. City Councilman.

19
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,122
It's bigger than
an election, Max.

20
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,181
BOSS?

21
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,521
There's a time and a place
for everything, gentlemen.

22
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,341
<i>You have an
obligation to provide</i>

23
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,509
<i>a place for me to dispose of
the waste products.</i>

24
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,053
<i>I got you.</i>

25
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,509
<i>Good morning.</i>

26
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,763
<i>You're listening to the Poorman
on the world-famous KROQ.</i>

27
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,641
<i>And you still have time
to call in on open-line,</i>

28
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,181
<i>where at 5am, let's face it,</i>

29
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,265
<i>we can talk about
absolutely anything.</i>

30
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,027
<i>It's live, it's uncensored,
and I'm not even using the tape delay</i>

31
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,234
<i>because this is prime time radio.</i>

32
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,817
<i>The 2 to 6 am show
where management sleeps.</i>

33
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,494
I gotta go to work.

34
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,047
Could you leave your board?
I may go out later.

35
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,921
My surfboard?

36
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,426
Yeah.
You promised me last night.

37
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,852
Yeah, you can use it.

38
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,139
<i>No tape delay.
Here we are on open-line.</i>

39
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,099
<i>Good morning. You're on the air.</i>

40
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,689
<i>- Hi, Poorman.
- Hi. Where are you calling from?</i>

41
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,196
- <i>South Bay.</i>
- <i>Well what can I do for you?</i>

42
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,028
<i>Well, you see,
my boyfriend just left me</i>

43
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,076
<i>and I'm really bummed
cos I loved him a lot, you know.</i>

44
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,613
<i>Well, why did your
boyfriend leave you?</i>

45
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,324
<i>He found me and his best friend
in bed together.</i>

46
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,205
<i>Well, what do you
expect him to do</i>

47
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,503
<i>if he found you in bed
with his best friend?</i>

48
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,250
<i>I don't know.
He could have maybe been</i>

49
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,831
<i>more understanding, you know.</i>

50
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,963
<i>Well, you got a problem that
you're gonna have to work out.</i>

51
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,545
<i>- Yeah?
- But not on my show.</i>

52
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,264
I hate politicians.

53
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,146
Yeah.

54
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,281
<i>Are we coming to work today,
Mr. Taylor, or what?</i>

55
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,109
Yeah, Walt, I'm flyin' out
the door right now.

56
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,790
Let's see if my favorite
little stewardess is up yet.

57
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,676
Lookin' good.

58
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,420
Oops.

59
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,596
Busted.

60
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,342
Fly those friendly skies.

61
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,860
Now that is the
perfect relationship.

62
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,826
Wait a minute.
Hello.

63
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,196
What are you looking at, pal?

64
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,170
Good morning.

65
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,466
Time for that morning
cup of hot java.

66
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:42,338
Coffee for one.
Three scoops, please.

67
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,223
Nice selection of wines.

68
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,053
Good California Chardonnay,
a bottle of Dom.

69
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,262
No market brands in this house.

70
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,602
Only the best.

71
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,492
Now for some sliced papaya,
if it's in season.

72
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,746
Shit! Mango.
I should have known.

73
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,704
I wish I knew your name.

74
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,186
Carl.

75
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,985
I thought you were
gonna be a no-show.

76
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,361
Almost.

77
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,699
Thanks.

78
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,658
Frost and Luzinski?

79
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,750
Yeah.

80
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,666
Hey, I don't know
about you shitheads,

81
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,547
but we're on a time clock.

82
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,173
Let's move!

83
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,593
Gina walked out on
me last night.

84
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,810
- Really?
- Yeah. Moved all her stuff out.

85
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,262
Face it, you've been
trying to bale out

86
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,268
of that relationship
for a long time.

87
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,600
Yeah, I just didn't expect it
to be so sudden.

88
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,942
Paybacks are a bitch, James!

89
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,871
- You seen my gloves, amigo?
- In the glove compartimente.

90
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,083
Who, hey hey hey!

91
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,687
- Hey, mister!
- Shut up, you dickhead.

92
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,649
Yes, I'm still here.
Now, about those mailers.

93
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,659
First off, you guys did
the colors wrong,

94
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,861
but I let that pass because
I'm a nice person.

95
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,280
And now you're telling me,

96
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,616
with the election one week
around the corner,

97
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,344
that the mailers
are gonna go out late?

98
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,744
<i>Well we're a little backed up-</i>

99
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,920
If you don't get those mailers
out by tomorrow afternoon,

100
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,122
I'm pulling the account.

101
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,749
- <i>You're gonna pull the account?</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

102
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,000
<i>- Umm...</i>
- Bye-bye.

103
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,968
Jerk.

104
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,390
I gotta hide this.

105
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,406
I've got a ton of things
need your signature, Jack.

106
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,402
Can it wait?

107
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,168
No, and I also have a
cassette of a band

108
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,077
that we might want to use
for the fundraiser.

109
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,594
I figured since we're
short on time,

110
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,457
you could give it a
quick listen and decide.

111
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,934
I really don't have time for that.

112
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,498
If you like 'em, use 'em.
You know I trust your judgment.

113
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,249
That's why I hired you
as a campaign manager.

114
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,750
You gotta trust your staff.

115
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,125
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

116
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,506
Listen...

117
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,804
- You're doing a hell of a job.
- Thank you, Jack.

118
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,831
- I didn't sleep for shit last night.
- Why not?

119
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,127
Gina.

120
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,206
Gina, Gina. Gina!

121
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,132
Let her go, man.

122
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:49,964
Let her go.

123
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,967
I have, I have.
She is historical.

124
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,122
She said she couldn't
see herself

125
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,682
with a garbageman
for the rest of her life.

126
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,309
Didn't you tell her you weren't
gonna be a garbageman

127
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,553
for the rest of your life?

128
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,937
Didn't you tell her about
our surf shop?

129
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,108
I told her.

130
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,732
I think she was getting
pressure from her family.

131
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,819
- Her father never liked you.
- Yeah, what does he know?

132
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,285
- Well, life's a bitch, right?
- Ain't that the truth!

133
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,371
I tell you, Carl, this is
the last year we throw trash.

134
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,006
- You said that last year.
- Yeah, but this year I mean it.

135
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,709
You meant it last year.

136
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,598
- Hey, Carl, is this yours?
- No, it ain't my color.

137
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,640
It's a bra, James.

138
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,558
Look at this smut.

139
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,734
Well, if it isn't the
South Bay's finest.

140
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,820
What happened, Mike?

141
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,530
Did they take away
your vroom-vrooms?

142
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,907
You see,
this is the kind of scum

143
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,460
you're gonna have to
get used to around here.

144
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,872
Jeff's new to the force,
so I'm giving him the tour.

145
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,128
He's also my new partner.

146
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,924
So you're gonna be seeing
a whole lot more of him.

147
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,300
Wonderful.

148
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,590
Yeah, you're gonna
like it here, Jeff.

149
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,426
The air's clean,
the women are beautiful

150
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,977
and the shifts are short.

151
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,600
You know, most of the
folks here in Las Playas

152
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,649
are hard-working,
with a future in mind...

153
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,069
with the exception of
these two clowns.

154
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,988
They're part of the
"Don't let this happen to you" crowd.

155
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,702
A word of warning,
my garbage-toting friends,

156
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,155
from your friendly
neighborhood peace officer.

157
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,413
I've got my eye on you both.

158
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,977
If you're not breaking
the law now,

159
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,995
the smart money says
that it's only a

160
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,205
matter of time before you will.

161
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,208
And you can bet
that last dollar that

162
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,839
my ass is gonna be
there to make the bust.

163
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,097
- Golf clap?
- Golf clap.

164
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,368
"Dear John. I'm sorry
things didn't work out for us."

165
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,071
"You're a sweet man,
and I'll always love you."

166
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,535
Ah!

167
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,286
You know, this is the kind of
shit that really breaks me up.

168
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,247
- It's an epidemic, I tell ya.
- What is?

169
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,634
Just women, relationships,
all of it.

170
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,962
I never have a problem with it.

171
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,463
- Hi, James.
- Morning, baby.

172
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,177
- That's cos you've got no heart.
- What?

173
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,020
You've got no heart.

174
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,189
Who was the last girl you
were serious about?

175
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,647
Betsy Sabetta.

176
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,736
Betsy Sabetta?

177
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,694
That was in the ninth grade
and she had a harelip.

178
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,900
- She did not.
- She did too.

179
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,827
- She did not!
- Did too, did too.

180
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,207
- What do you know about her, anyway?
- I know she had a harelip.

181
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,417
What an absolutely gorgeous day.

182
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,336
Warm sun, beautiful women.

183
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,932
And the air is
just right for drinking.

184
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,692
Would you just look at all the activity
that's going on down here, Carl.

185
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,276
It's close, man. I can see it.

186
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,861
Right here, right on the strand.

187
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,573
Carl and James' Surf Shop.

188
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,488
It's gold. It's gold, James.
It's a gold mine.

189
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,017
Just think of the
garbage business

190
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,993
as a way station on
the road to Nirvana.

191
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,078
Well maybe now you're a
single man again,

192
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,286
you'll be able to put more
time and energy into it.

193
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,082
Whoa. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

194
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,925
Hold on, wait a minute,
just a second.

195
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,347
I have put a lot of energy into
getting our surf shop together.

196
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,786
And we'd be a lot further along

197
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,634
if I didn't have to do
the work for two.

198
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,053
Pardon me?

199
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,476
Let's not forget that
it was me who chose

200
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,398
the bank that we
went to to get our loan.

201
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,727
Let's not forget that we
didn't even get the loan.

202
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,437
I mean it's not like
you researched it, James.

203
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,693
You picked the name
out of the Yellow Pages.

204
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:03,989
What exactly are...

205
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,488
Good God!

206
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,578
What exactly are you
trying to say here, Carl?

207
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,781
What I'm trying to say, James,

208
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,541
is that sometimes you
are completely hopeless.

209
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,466
- Really?
- Yes.

210
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,793
- Hey, Carl.
- Yeah.

211
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,296
What exactly did
you mean by hopeless?

212
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,135
I meant exactly what I said.

213
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,183
I still don't understand.

214
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,769
Well, let's examine the word.

215
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:39,397
"“Hopeless." Less than hopeful.
That's what you are.

216
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,823
But am I majorly hopeless
or partially hopeless?

217
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,616
I would say majorly.

218
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,151
Why do you ask?

219
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,534
- I'll try to change.
- No, you won't.

220
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,362
I need to talk to you, Leo.

221
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,949
Jack, nice to see you.

222
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,700
I need your help
on something, Leo.

223
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,787
I know who's responsible for the

224
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,289
toxic dumping off Las Playas,

225
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,746
and I'm kind of involved.

226
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,084
Jesus, Jack.

227
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,291
I just never thought
it would go this far.

228
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,717
Look, it's all on the tape.
Listen to this.

229
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,314
What is this?
Some kind of a joke?

230
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,478
This is not the right tape.

231
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,735
She took the wrong tape!

232
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,615
- What are you talking about?
- The wrong tape!

233
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,121
Hey, wait a minute.

234
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,051
Come on. Let's do the nasty.

235
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,178
- Do we have to?
- Yeah, afraid so.

236
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,429
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

237
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,891
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

238
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,728
Yeah, Dalton here.

239
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,694
Listen, Jack Berger was
in here earlier today.

240
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,491
Claimed he knew
who was responsible

241
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,865
for those Las Playas
offshore dumpings.

242
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,743
Claimed he had some kind
of a tape that could prove it.

243
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,372
I don't know. This might be nothing,
but I thought you should know.

244
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,203
You did the
right thing, Captain.

245
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:09,213
I'm sure it's nothing,
but I appreciate the call.

246
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,385
- Any <i>time.</i>
- Thank you.

247
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,302
A tape.

248
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,476
A goddamn tape.

249
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,597
Shrewd move, Berger.

250
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,215
Hey, boys!
Where's your originality, huh?

251
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,597
This means war, man.

252
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,229
Hey, this is shit. It's shit!

253
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,306
Get it off me, Frost!
Get it off!

254
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,312
It's shit! It's shit!

255
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,269
It's payback time,
you little shits!

256
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,814
Gentlemen, inside now.

257
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,785
- What's up, Walt?
- Nothing too serious today.

258
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,992
I got a complaint about banging

259
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,620
trash cans on P Street
at 6 am this morning.

260
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,246
You boys know
anything about this?

261
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:26,577
No, sir.

262
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,289
Which one of you
rolled the bowling ball

263
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,090
down the alley into Avenue H?

264
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,005
Can't help you there either, Walt.

265
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,678
In the two years you
have worked here,

266
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,097
you have broken
every city ordinance

267
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,924
that pertains to this
line of work.

268
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,172
Well, you can't say
we haven't been a lot of laughs.

269
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,851
I'm glad you have a
sense of humor, Mr. St James.

270
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,898
Unfortunately, the
majority of the people

271
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,850
in this community do not.

272
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:55,156
Now me, personally,
I like you boys.

273
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:58,155
Which is why
I'm giving you another chance.

274
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:03,326
Starting tomorrow, you boys
will be riding with a third party.

275
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,498
What?

276
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,871
I have decided to send an observer
along with you on your route.

277
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,922
A representative of Shoreline.

278
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,380
- Who's the observer?
- My brother-in-law.

279
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,057
Consider yourselves
on probation.

280
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:25,095
I suggest you be
on your best behavior.

281
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,353
The nerve of Walt,

282
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,156
sending us on our route
with a goddamn baby-sitter.

283
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,696
Don't worry about it.

284
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:47,330
What does a... phrenologist
feel and interpret?

285
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,625
The size of Walt's asshole.

286
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,245
Wrong.

287
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,423
No, a phrenologist
feels and interprets

288
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,593
the bumps on your head,
skull features.

289
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,794
Very good.

290
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,347
Who was Richard Nixon's
Chief of Staff

291
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,425
during the final days
of Watergate?

292
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,392
Oprah Winfrey.

293
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,103
No, that was... Alexander Haig.

294
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,267
That's right.

295
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,106
What does gasoline...

296
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,694
Jack! Jack!

297
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,240
The tape!
What did you do with the tape?

298
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,168
Jesus Christ!

299
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,761
What are you doing?

300
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,838
I hate shitheads who
bully their women.

301
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,721
- So what are you gonna do?
- Shoot him.

302
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,724
- What?
- It's the principle, James.

303
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:49,850
With a pellet gun?

304
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,273
What are you gonna accomplish
using that stupid thing?

305
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,980
It allows me to seriously
aggravate a situation

306
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,437
without actually changing
the course of history.

307
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,818
It also stings like a bitch.

308
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,622
Well, I'm glad that's over.

309
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,538
Carl, what are you doing?
Everything's cool now.

310
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,043
Mister, it's nothing personal.

311
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,890
- Where do you think you got him?
- Butt shot.

312
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,476
He'll never lay a
hand on her again.

313
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,506
You know what, asshole, I wouldn't
have voted for you anyway.

314
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,323
- Stop it! Stop it!
- What?

315
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,493
Shoot him in the head,
his head's all over the place.

316
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,699
Oh, genius.

317
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,646
Touchdown! The tape!
Touchdown!

318
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:19,977
Genius.

319
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:32,783
Man, this guy's really heavy.
I gotta start working out.

320
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,576
- You should go to the gym.
- I hate weights.

321
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,462
- You work on your cardiovascular.
- What's that?

322
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,039
You know, get yourself on
one of those life cycles.

323
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,294
What's that?

324
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,751
- Stationary bike.
- Yeah? How are they?

325
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,302
They're great. They got...

326
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,136
cross-country skiing machines,
things where you row.

327
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,013
Come on, get him in there.
I wanna go eat.

328
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,557
Come on, come on, come on.

329
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,184
I got it. Start the car.

330
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,227
Right, Jack, I have the tape.
I really hate...

331
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,403
Jack?

332
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,273
Jack?

333
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,715
Touch that again and I kill you.
I swear to God I'll kill you.

334
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,007
What'd I do?

335
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,971
Why don't you
go a little bit faster,

336
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,049
see if you can put me
through the windshield.

337
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,464
Where the hell am I?

338
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,598
Time for work. Boy, oh boy.

339
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,981
James, do us both a favor.

340
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,893
Whatever you do,

341
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,985
don't give this observer guy
a hard time today.

342
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,320
I figure if we behave ourselves,

343
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,574
show him that
we're a couple of good guys,

344
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,752
we'll get him out of
our hair a lot quicker.

345
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,083
OK.

346
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,131
For all we know...

347
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,675
he could be some crazed
combat veteran.

348
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,077
You're driving too fast.

349
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,248
So, Louis, you're Walt's
brother-in-law.

350
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,705
That's great.
Speaks highly of you.

351
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,335
What do you know about anything?

352
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,500
Walt's a nice guy.

353
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,338
His sister must be nice too.
I've never met her, though.

354
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,178
When I feel like talking to you,
I will look at you.

355
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,429
Gotcha.

356
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,568
You writing stuff about us?
Sorry. Sorry.

357
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,897
This sucks.

358
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,201
What did you say, son?

359
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,904
The name is James.

360
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,372
Well, James,
if you expect to keep this job,

361
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,375
I suggest you tell me what it was
you were mumbling over there.

362
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:09,335
James.

363
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,551
I said this sucks.

364
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,421
And, basically, so do you.

365
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,372
You little... I'll show you
not to talk to me like that!

366
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,533
Hey, hey! Goddammit!

367
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,510
This Louis guy's a
total nightmare.

368
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,264
He's not playin' around,
let me tell you, James.

369
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,723
Yeah, I feel really
bad about that, Carl.

370
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,642
Probably not as bad as I do.

371
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,787
- James, promise me something.
- What?

372
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,832
No matter what you do,
do not provoke this guy.

373
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,124
- Promise.
- I'm serious.

374
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,459
I promise.

375
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,641
- How's that nose?
- It's OK.

376
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,852
I still owe one to the
intended receiver.

377
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,019
You know, man,
you're a total pain in the a-

378
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,941
Now, James, Louis is gonna be with us
for the next couple of weeks.

379
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,029
Accept this as fact.

380
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,362
Now why don't you guys shake hands
and stop behaving like children?

381
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,711
- Put it on the back of your neck.
- Thanks.

382
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,636
There are several
sacred things in this world

383
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,842
that you don't ever mess with.

384
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,555
One of them happens to be
another man's fries.

385
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,973
Now, you remember that,

386
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,525
and you will live a long
and healthy life.

387
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:30,949
James.

388
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,002
- James.
- What?

389
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,665
I think you'd better get over
here and take a look at this.

390
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,341
What is it, Carl?

391
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,173
Just take a look.

392
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,188
What the hell is this, Carl?

393
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,517
It's a dead human being, James.

394
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:59,274
Yeah? What's he doin'
on our route?

395
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,654
Oh, looky here.

396
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:09,326
Looks like somebody threw
away a perfectly good white boy.

397
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,790
And he sure looks
a hell of a lot like that dude.

398
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,761
We're screwed.

399
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,762
What do you mean "we"?
You pulled the trigger, pal.

400
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,053
Look, Louis, we gotta talk.

401
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,972
You see, Louis,
Carl sort of knows this guy.

402
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,685
- So?
- I don't know him at all.

403
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,816
What I'm trying to say
is he shot him.

404
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,018
With a pellet gun!

405
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,483
- But he thought he hit him in the butt.
- I did hit him in the butt.

406
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,065
You two seem to be
in some serious shit here.

407
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,154
I need a drink.

408
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,867
Look, Louis, I know
that I did not kill this man.

409
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,511
You see, last night this guy here
was beatin' on his old lady,

410
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,575
so I took upon myself
to end the dispute.

411
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,957
- So you shot him?
- With a pellet gun.

412
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,378
So you said.

413
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,796
- And you shot him from where?
- From my apartment.

414
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,883
So how in the hell
did he end up here?

415
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,464
Why don't you ask him?

416
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,804
Have some.
It'll settle your nerves.

417
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,723
My nerves don't need settling!

418
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,355
What is the maximum sentence
for murder?

419
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,149
I did not murder anyone!

420
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,393
Jesus Christ, James,
whose side are you on?

421
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,818
I am not taking sides.

422
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,646
Yes you are,
you've already convicted me.

423
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:26,986
As far as you're concerned,
I'm on my way to death row.

424
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,445
Now Carl, come on.

425
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,088
Let me tell you something, pal,
you are in it as much as I am.

426
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,955
You were there.
That makes you an accomplice.

427
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,374
Look, you little bastard, I never
wanted you to do it in the first place.

428
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,575
I was totally against it.

429
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,085
Try explaining that
to the judge.

430
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,630
I am not gonna have to explain
anything to any judge.

431
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,709
- This is your ball game, Carl.
- You are an asshole!

432
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,136
- And you are a trigger-happy idiot!
- I'm not gonna rot in prison alone.

433
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,089
You're not gonna mess up my life,
you son of a bitch!

434
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:52,932
Hey!

435
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,386
You and your stupid pellet gun!

436
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,565
- Get off of me!
- I'll kill you!

437
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,603
You're a stupid man!
You're a stupid little man!

438
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,442
I said enough!
I said cut it out!

439
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,484
Hey, you! I said knock it off!

440
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:16,077
Now look, unless one of you two guys
took a piece of rope or a piece of wire

441
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,833
and strangled this guy,
I'd say you're both in the clear.

442
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,661
How the hell do you know?

443
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,918
You can tell by the
marks on his neck.

444
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,343
Look at that.

445
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,262
Pretty sloppy job, too.

446
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,386
Not a great idea to keep him
out in the open like this.

447
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,683
[Elm

448
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,930
I don't like this, Carl.
I don't like this one bit.

449
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,978
- I'm goin' to the cops.
- What?

450
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,851
Looks like they're comin' to us.

451
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,859
I hate cops.

452
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:03,746
Well, well. Another fine day
in the dumps, eh, fellas?

453
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:10,885
Who are your friends?

454
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,635
I've never seen you
around here before.

455
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,841
Louis here works for
the company.

456
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,450
He'll be ridin' with us
for the next

457
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,688
couple of weeks to police
our activities, so to speak.

458
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,272
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir, Officer, sir.

459
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,732
- What about you?
- He's...

460
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,318
I didn't ask you, garbageman.

461
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,530
I'm asking the punk who looks
like he's had a few too many.

462
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,156
What the hell's the
matter with him?

463
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,829
He looks friggin' dead.

464
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,906
Well, the boy's had a
rough night.

465
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,913
He's, you know, a,
you know, a...

466
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,329
a cousin of James.

467
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,380
He flew in from, uh...

468
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:49,965
Texas.

469
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,793
We were out late showin'
him a good time.

470
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,323
Well wherever the
hell he's from,

471
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,593
he shouldn't be out on
the street in his condition.

472
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,470
I could haul you in, you know.

473
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,218
But for now I'm just
gonna give you a warning.

474
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:04,148
- That's very kind of you, Officer.
- Yeah, it is.

475
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,057
Now get him inside the
cab of that truck

476
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,401
and make sure he stays
there until he sobers up.

477
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,655
- Do I make myself clear?
- Crystal, sir. Let's go.

478
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,110
Not so fast.

479
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:27,838
I've got the whole Las Playas police
department clued into you two bozos.

480
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,582
You may have escaped
me this time,

481
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,465
and all I can say is
"Relish this moment, gentlemen."

482
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,141
This is wrong.
This is just wrong, wrong, wrong!

483
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,602
We should have just told them.

484
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,071
Told them what?

485
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,824
That we found a
body in the trash

486
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,700
that just happened to
be Jack Berger,

487
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,581
the same man that I shot
with a pellet gun?

488
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,946
Are you nuts?

489
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,742
Those guys are lookin' for
any excuse to put us away.

490
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,701
Let's get outta here.
We'll stash the body,

491
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,071
we'll get back to work and
we'll figure this out later.

492
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,932
Son of a bitch!

493
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,476
I can't believe this.
We lost the body.

494
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,941
Hey, relax.
We didn't lose the body.

495
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,946
It's here somewhere,
it's in a big yellow can.

496
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:36,944
How can we miss it?

497
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,321
What the hell do you mean,
you've lost the body?

498
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,449
It just kind of fell out
of the back of the car.

499
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,997
Oh, well.

500
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,791
Find it! Find it, find it,
find it, find it!

501
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,992
Yes, sir.

502
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,169
Your very lives
depend upon it, gentlemen.

503
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:55,876
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- Sir, we did find the tape.

504
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,673
Oh.

505
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,509
Thank God.

506
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,766
You're excused.

507
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,574
- Wait a minute. The girl.
- What girl?

508
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,165
- The girl we saw Berger fighting with.
- What about her?

509
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,997
Well, maybe she had
something to do with his death.

510
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,042
Yeah, so she strangles him,
stuffs him in a barrel

511
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,797
and dumps him on the esplanade?

512
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,925
It makes a lot of sense, Carl.

513
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,048
You know...

514
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,470
That stiff's startin' to
get a little gamy.

515
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,481
You guys come up with anything?

516
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:55,151
Carl seems to think that
Berger's girl is somehow involved.

517
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,604
Louis, the last time
that we saw Berger alive

518
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,486
was during that fight across
from my apartment, right?

519
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,569
- It's not enough to go on, Carl.
- Well it's a place to start, James.

520
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,868
How about starting by
going to the police?

521
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,195
Something we should have
clone in the first place.

522
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,374
Yo! Carl's right.
It's a place to start.

523
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,760
We're not gonna accomplish
a goddamn thing

524
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,127
standing around here.

525
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,426
So you guys are either
with me or you're not.

526
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,795
I thought you knew
how to rig that thing?

527
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,712
I followed the instructions.

528
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,821
You guys have anything good
to eat in this place?

529
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,361
- I could order us a pizza.
- Sounds great.

530
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,159
Pepperoni, extra cheese.

531
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,457
Maybe we should put old Milhous
someplace a little less visible.

532
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,882
What do you say?

533
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,049
I need a large pepperoni,
extra cheese,

534
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:33,218
to 828 Esplanade, apartment 405.

535
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,678
Last name, Taylor.

536
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:36,934
Yeah.

537
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,184
OK, what's the total on that?

538
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,840
Hey, Carl.

539
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:10,221
Hello.

540
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,924
She hardly looks like
a cold-blooded killer.

541
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,516
What now, hotshot?

542
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,057
How about goin' over
there and tellin' her

543
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,665
that we got her boyfriend's
dead body sittin' in our shitter?

544
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,567
What are we gonna do?

545
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,406
Stand here watching
her like a bunch

546
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,280
of long-distance
Peeping Toms?

547
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,449
No.

548
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,207
- I'm goin' over there.
- What?

549
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,494
- I'm goin' over there.
- What for?

550
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,170
I don't know. Snoop around,
see what I can come up with.

551
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,340
Carl, this is not some game.

552
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,674
What if you're wrong?

553
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,377
What if she didn't have
anything to do with this?

554
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,429
Gee, James, you sound as if
you're really worried about me.

555
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,530
You sure you know what you're doing?

556
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,719
Come on, guys.
I'm not gonna get in over my head.

557
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,476
Well, that depends on
which head you're talkin' about.

558
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,557
Look, we got your back.

559
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,019
If anything funny happens,
don't be too shy to scream.

560
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,029
OK. Save me a slice.

561
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,779
Do you know where
he keeps that gun of his?

562
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,357
What is he doing?

563
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,571
What am I doing?

564
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,853
Uh-oh.

565
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,193
- Don't kill me!
- What?

566
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,362
What? I'm sorry.

567
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,913
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I've never been better.

568
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,462
- Do you live here in the-
- I'm sorry if I-

569
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,996
You first.

570
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,839
- Do you live here in the building?
- Yes, I do live here in the building.

571
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,466
For five years I've been
in the building.

572
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:59,599
That's funny.
I've never seen you here before.

573
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,886
Well, I lead a very...
private life.

574
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:05,851
I'm a... a... phrenologist.

575
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,058
What exactly does a
phrenologist do?

576
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,387
Well, I feel and interpret
the size of Walt's asshole.

577
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,938
I mean, skull features.

578
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,280
Wow.

579
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:25,492
Not to impose, but if we can go
inside and put some ice on this ankle,

580
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,997
that'd be great.

581
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,704
- Inside where?
- Your apartment.

582
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,997
What's the matter with yours?

583
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:36,629
No, my ice machine is broken,
and yours is right here.

584
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:41,300
Are you gonna refuse a wounded man
in dire need of medical attention?

585
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,219
- No.
- Thanks.

586
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,100
- But I didn't catch your name.
- I'm Ted Blanston, the third.

587
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,360
Susan Wilkins, the first.

588
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,647
He's inside.
He's inside her apartment.

589
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,233
Out that light.

590
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,241
What the hell's Carl doing?

591
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,710
I don't like this, man.
I do not like this.

592
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,824
Shh.

593
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,787
Asshole!

594
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,917
The hell with this.
I'm callin' the police.

595
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,721
No cops. I hate cops.

596
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,188
I'm sorry, which ankle was it?

597
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,734
It's the swollen one.

598
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,246
- I really appreciate this.
- It's no trouble.

599
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,913
Are you friendly with
the Cottlers?

600
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,383
- I think...
- Second floor?

601
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,211
- Ron and Ann?
- Oh, sure.

602
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,138
Well, I figured,
since you're both doctors.

603
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,592
Right. We're all doctors.

604
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,561
Where exactly do you practice?

605
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,317
I got a small office down
in the medical district and...

606
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,149
You know, I could really
use a drink.

607
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,527
- Just one.
- Me too.

608
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,487
Thanks.

609
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,709
- Sorry.
- I could have brought it to you.

610
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,294
Thank you.

611
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,930
It's for the pain.

612
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:36,316
I rarely touch the stuff.
Can I have another one?

613
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,271
I don't believe this.

614
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,649
They're doin' shots,
for Christ's sake.

615
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,863
I can't believe I've never
met you before.

616
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,332
I thought I knew just about
everyone who lived in this building.

617
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,620
Well, as I said,
I lead a very private life.

618
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,879
Very private life. Yeah.

619
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,003
You know, you're a very
beautiful woman.

620
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,511
No, I mean that.
I've always thought so.

621
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,513
What do you mean, always?

622
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,851
What I meant was that
you've probably always been beautiful

623
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,184
and it's a shame that
I'm just now discovering this.

624
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:21,519
Oh.

625
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,651
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
embarrass you.

626
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:30,449
Well, you did.
You wanna switch to champagne?

627
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,948
Sure, if the Dom Perignon is chilled,
that'd be perfect.

628
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,575
How did you know I had Dom?

629
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,003
How did I know you had Dom?

630
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,290
Doesn't everybody?

631
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:02,144
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom, Louis.

632
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,909
Jesus! Carl spends the evening
with a beautiful woman

633
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,658
and I'm stuck here
with a lunatic and a corpse.

634
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,491
I don't believe this guy.

635
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:46,107
I can't do this with
you starin' at me.

636
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,279
- Who is it?
- Pedro's Pizza and Pancakes.

637
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,448
Yeah!

638
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,624
OK.

639
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,630
- Large pepperoni, extra cheese.
- Yes indeed, that's us.

640
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,549
- How much?
- Eight bucks.

641
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,343
- How much?
- Eight bucks.

642
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,342
OK. One, two,

643
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,719
three, four...

644
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,887
- What's going on here?
- Mind your own business, son.

645
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,977
OK. Thank you, sir.

646
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,392
You've seen too much.

647
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,237
Louis, what the hell
are you doing?

648
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,568
He saw you with the body.

649
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,177
He could start all kinds
of trouble.

650
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,746
So you kidnap him?
Good solution!

651
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,246
Here, take the money.
I won't say anything to anybody!

652
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,206
You bet you won't!

653
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,958
What the hell?

654
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,506
Extra cheese?

655
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,850
- You're a madman.
- He was provoking me.

656
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,678
This situation has definitely
gotten way out of hand.

657
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,518
Get back to that window
and keep Carl covered.

658
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,937
Well what the hell do
we do with him?

659
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:08,860
We need some rope.

660
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,317
Are you gonna get this or what?

661
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,995
- Hello?
- First, you lose the body,

662
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,753
and then you deliver
me the wrong tape.

663
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,960
Now, I don't think that
either of you personally

664
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,258
set out to destroy my company.

665
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,344
But I sent you out
on a simple task.

666
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,594
And, simply put,
you loused it up.

667
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,601
Now, apparently,

668
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,857
Berger had a special relationship
with his campaign manager,

669
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:51,521
a Susan Wilkins, 825 Esplanade.

670
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,485
That's where
we iced Berger, chief.

671
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:54,781
I know where that is.

672
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,364
Well...

673
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:01,163
Did it ever occur to you two idiots
that she might have the cassette?

674
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,503
I think he wants us
to kill some more people.

675
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,129
OK.

676
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:14,419
If I had my 16,
I could pick her off so easily.

677
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,473
This is good. Did you make it?

678
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:28,607
<i>Reporting from Hanoi Hilton.
Yankee dogs, you might as well give up.</i>

679
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,690
<i>The war is lost.
Jane Fonda was right.</i>

680
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,531
Are you hungry?
Would you like some?

681
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,864
- Don't give him any, James.
- Why not? He might be hungry.

682
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,993
He's a prisoner,
and he should be treated accordingly.

683
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,960
Have you completely
lost your mind?

684
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,167
We're not soldiers and he's not
the enemy. He's a pizza man.

685
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,298
Back in Phu Bai,

686
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,549
he would have been killed the
second he knocked on that door.

687
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,721
I would've snapped his
neck like a twig.

688
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,890
And he never would've
seen it coming, either.

689
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,845
- Louis, Louis, calm down.
- The Commie bastard gets no food!

690
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,731
Yeah.

691
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,189
Yes, indeed.

692
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,271
That is deep.

693
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,903
That is definitely deep.

694
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,988
Yes.

695
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,029
<i>Hm.</i>

696
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,199
That's an interesting one.

697
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,369
So is that one.

698
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,583
You were born through
Caesarean, no?

699
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,005
No.

700
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,803
Well, it's not an
exact science, of course.

701
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,880
Apparently not.

702
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,849
Mangoes. You love mangoes.

703
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,393
How did you know that?

704
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,396
Well, it's all here in
the contours.

705
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,485
Yeah.

706
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,775
So, that's phrenology.

707
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,451
It's fascinating, no?

708
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,496
No. Weird.

709
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:09,750
You know what?
First, let's take this off.

710
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,792
And let's do something.

711
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,418
We are doing something.

712
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,377
No, let's get out of here
and do something.

713
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,805
- Like what?
- I don't know, but it'll be fun.

714
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,303
Why this sudden burst of energy?
My ankle's killing me.

715
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,259
Oh, your ankle.
Come on.

716
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,055
- You want me to get this?
- Oh.

717
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,441
Do you always look in
people's trash?

718
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:44,486
Well, sometimes it's the
best way to get to know 'em.

719
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:49,908
No, no, no. I wanna report
a murder and a kidnapping.

720
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,292
- <i>Murder and</i> a <i>kidnapping.</i>
- <i>Yes,</i> that's right.

721
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:55,671
<i>- Did</i> they take the <i>body?</i>
- No, no, no. I have the body.

722
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,378
- <i>Did you kill the victim, sir?</i>
- <i>No,</i> I didn't kill <i>him.</i>

723
00:56:58,582 --> 00:56:59,799
<i>Have you been kidnapped?</i>

724
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,252
No, I'm not the one
who's been kidnapped.

725
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,509
Listen, listen, listen, I know
this sounds really strange-

726
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:05,805
<i>I don't think we can help you, sir.</i>

727
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:07,349
Well, fuck me!

728
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,472
Isn't that what the police are
supposed to do, help people?

729
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,428
I am telling you...

730
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,104
They're leaving. Let's go.

731
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,524
Dammit!

732
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,651
Let's move it! Come on!

733
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,903
The pizza clown goes with us.

734
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,205
Get him on his feet.
I'll get Tricky Dick.

735
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:40,007
I want you to know, James,
this is all going on my report.

736
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,800
That's great, Louis.

737
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,520
Just make sure you spell
my name right.

738
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,345
Don't cross me, James.

739
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:55,227
All right, let's whack this
broad and get the tape.

740
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,274
Jesus Christ. That's Berger.

741
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,815
What the hell?

742
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,660
Get back here, you goof.

743
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:21,043
- Who's the kid in the clown suit?
- I don't know.

744
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:25,086
<i>Oh'. Oh, GOG'. Oh, Christ'.!</i>

745
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,807
Those bastards are gonna pay.

746
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,885
Oh, yeah. They're payin'.

747
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,016
Yo!

748
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,445
There's the broad.
There goes the broad.

749
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,486
Come on, come on,
come on, you moron.

750
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,007
Are we late for something?

751
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,840
- Faster, James, faster.
- I got it to the floor, Louis.

752
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,605
Who are those guys?

753
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,434
How the hell am I supposed
to know who they are?

754
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,439
And where do these guys
get off, takin' our body?

755
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,113
Come on, we're losing 'em.

756
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:49,010
Oh, Christ.

757
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,631
- Oh, shit.
- I've almost been waiting for this.

758
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,433
Now you see this here?
This complicates things.

759
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,846
I just don't like killing
cops too much.

760
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,355
Hey, forget about
the body, okay?

761
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,273
They're the ones drivin'
around with it.

762
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,896
I say we stay with the girl.

763
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,195
Potterdam says she
might have the tape.

764
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,323
Hey, Biff, help me, all right.
Who just died and made you king?

765
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:13,702
Hey, Mario, how about this?
Your mother did.

766
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,615
Don't you ever say anything,
ever, about my mother.

767
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,743
Your mother did, your mother did
your mother did.

768
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:20,833
Mario!

769
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,543
- How do we handle this?
- Just pull over.

770
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,129
OK, everybody. Act natural.

771
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:54,284
Well, well, well.
Look who we got here.

772
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,910
I am in no mood
for this right now, Mike.

773
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,121
Just write up the ticket so we
can all get on with our lives.

774
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:05,458
Well, I might not be able to let
you off so easy there, Jimbo.

775
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,966
See, you were doing 65 in a 35,
and you ran a red light.

776
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,595
That's reckless driving
as far as I'm concerned.

777
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:16,223
Who else you got
in there with you, Jimbo?

778
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,221
Um, uh...

779
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,188
What the hell is
going on in here?

780
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:27,522
You're... You're never
gonna believe this, Mike.

781
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,771
I... we, uh...

782
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,630
I'm totally floundering.
I can't even come up with a good lie.

783
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,655
What'd I tell you, James?

784
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:44,418
I knew you were crooked and I knew
I'd catch up to you sooner or later.

785
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,671
All right, everybody out of
the vehicle right now.

786
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,752
- Don't do it!
- Don't shoot!

787
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,630
- He's got a gun.
- Don't shoot! Please, don't shoot!

788
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,889
Yeah, cop. I know you, man.

789
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,261
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking,

790
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:01,386
"We got us another crazy
nigger here with a gun."

791
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:04,350
human life means very little

792
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,976
to me at this point in time.

793
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:11,278
You see, I thrive on misery.
In the jungle, misery's all you got.

794
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:15,236
But things are different back here
in the world, or so they seem.

795
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,527
Nobody wants to talk about
pain and suffering.

796
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:22,914
Everybody wants
everything to be nice and civil.

797
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,209
Well, OK, then. Let's be nice.

798
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,662
Let's be civil.

799
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,964
And let's drop those guns
before I pull this trigger

800
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,337
and change the way
you feel about me.

801
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,518
Will the officer to the
rear of the truck

802
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,847
kindly drop his revolver
as well?

803
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:57,236
You know, you cops must really
think I'm as dumb as you look.

804
01:02:57,399 --> 01:03:01,404
Now, don't you know that when
a flashlight hits the cement,

805
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:05,119
it makes a completely
different sound than a revolver?

806
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:08,001
Let's be good boys,
and do exactly as I say.

807
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,880
OK, now, I want Mr. Sneaky Man

808
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:19,304
to come around and join
his partner, Mr. Bonehead.

809
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,350
Sorry, GUYS-

810
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:38,862
You will swing for this, James.
I shit you not!

811
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:46,081
I don't know, boys, but they look
pretty goddamn sweet to me.

812
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,496
What do you think?

813
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,228
What do you think?

814
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,355
How you doing?

815
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,987
I'm OK.

816
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,949
I think my body's gone
into shock from all the alcohol.

817
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,655
I'd like to sit down, actually.

818
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,654
What was that for?

819
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,277
You didn't like it.

820
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,277
No, I liked it... a lot.

821
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:06,907
Then shut up.

822
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,522
It feels like we're
drivin' in circles.

823
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,811
Carl could be anywhere.

824
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,211
You want some?

825
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:01,291
Promise you're not gonna scream
and cry if I take that gag off?

826
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,760
Now, if you're lyin',
Louis'll have to bash you.

827
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,091
You do understand, don't you?

828
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,848
Thank you. Thank you.

829
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,604
- It needs sugar.
- What?

830
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,938
Nothing.

831
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,525
It's not lookin' too good, is it?

832
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:32,076
- You givin' up?
- I never give up.

833
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,995
I never have. Never once, James.

834
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,171
I'm gonna take us back
along the esplanade.

835
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,666
Feels like a long shot to me.

836
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:45,093
At this point in time,
everything's a long shot.

837
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,138
I can't see anything.
Frost, gimme some light.

838
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:52,722
This is just a little uncool,
Luzinski.

839
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:56,559
Our brouhaha is with Carl,
not with the chick.

840
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,941
I'm just makin' a simple
adjustment, nothing major.

841
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:04,104
Shake 'em up a little bit.
Now, can I have some light, please?

842
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:06,823
Thank you.

843
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,609
- Come on, come on. Hurry up.
- Oh, yeah.

844
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:16,913
Now let's find James, and teach
that simple bastard a lesson too.

845
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,261
Hiya, kids. Are we having fun?

846
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:31,055
- Ted, what's happening?
- Who the hell are you guys?

847
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:32,724
HEY, shut up, you!

848
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,181
What the hell is that?

849
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,221
- It's a taser.
- A what?

850
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,312
A taser.
65,000 volts of electricity.

851
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:44,360
This thing completely incapacitates
the victim without killing them.

852
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,445
I got it on sale.

853
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,523
Let's move it. Let's go.

854
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,823
Put your hands up.

855
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,779
Ted, I think you should
do something.

856
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:58,075
If you come up with any ideas,
please let me know.

857
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,539
We have the right to know
what's going on here.

858
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:04,548
Hey, put a cork in it, sister.
You have no more rights.

859
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:07,459
And you, buying a
goddamn laser gun.

860
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,548
- Taser.
- Whatever.

861
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:13,716
- You've always gotta be so different.
- I'm in no mood, all right. Just lay off.

862
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,427
- No, you gotta be creative.
- I said lay off.

863
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,354
When I say "now", start running.

864
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,859
You know, Biff, you're an
amazing man.

865
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,777
You know shit about
absolutely nothing.

866
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,525
Now I've just heard everything.

867
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,279
Hold it, honey.

868
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,911
You listen to me, you Italian
son of a bitch, and you listen good.

869
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:38,573
The clay you tell me I don't know
shit and I let you get away with it

870
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,783
is the day that that ocean
freezes over.

871
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:42,710
- That's it. You're over.
- Furthermore, you dumb bastard-

872
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:47,165
Now!

873
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,973
- That's my car!
- Looks pretty undriveable.

874
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:01,429
Come on!

875
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,353
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

876
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:14,155
Ted!

877
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,446
Ted, what the hell's going on?

878
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,406
I left out a couple of
things about myself.

879
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,207
I'm waiting, you son of a bitch!

880
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,501
First of all, my name isn't Ted.
It's Carl.

881
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,288
So from now on when you yell
for me in a panic, yell Carl.

882
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,001
Something tells me there's more.

883
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,132
OK, last night you and
Jack Berger had a fight.

884
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,459
An argument in your
apartment, right?

885
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,921
How the hell could you
have possibly known that?

886
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:38,929
Look, Susan, I don't
live in your building.

887
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:42,687
I am a garbageman.
I live across the street from you.

888
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,439
Now, I have been watching you almost
every day for the last six weeks.

889
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:49,068
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.
You have been spying on me?

890
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:52,447
- I don't really consider it spying.
- What would you consider it, then?

891
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,734
Let me finish! You and Jack
had a fight, you left angry

892
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,619
and the next morning I found
Berger's body in the trash.

893
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:01,156
- Jack's body?
- Somebody killed him, Susan.

894
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:03,916
- For a while I thought it was you.
- No, Jack is not dead.

895
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,835
Jack was over at my
apartment last night.

896
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,912
Trust me, Jack is dead.

897
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:11,091
Jack came over because there
was some mix-up with a tape

898
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,759
and I went down to my car to get
the right tape and...

899
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,337
The tape, the tape.

900
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:16,592
This is what had Jack
so worked up.

901
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,798
Come on, we gotta get
this to the police!

902
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:23,102
- What the hell was that for?
- For lying to me. I hate liars!

903
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,476
Hates liars?

904
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,481
That's for spying on me!

905
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:35,899
Come on!

906
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,037
What happened?

907
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:52,423
It was something.
You got struck by lightning.

908
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,053
- Really?
- A freak storm.

909
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,096
- Police!
- Thank God.

910
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,864
- Police!
- Hello!

911
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,025
Over here, by the playground.

912
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:32,421
Ew.

913
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,434
Sorry, GUYS-

914
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:50,269
Wait! It's not what it looks like.
Please, give us a hand.

915
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,310
No, I'm really not into it,
but thanks.

916
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:55,111
Carl! Come on, Carl.

917
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,360
Everything I ever said
about you, just kidding.

918
01:11:58,564 --> 01:11:59,690
He was.

919
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:04,154
You're not really gonna
leave us here, are you?

920
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,534
That would be...

921
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:20,296
- Come on, come on, already!
- About a thousand keys here.

922
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:26,722
- Try this one. This one.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

923
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:35,689
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

924
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:38,817
- I got it!
- Look out.

925
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,402
- Move!
- Look out!

926
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,824
It's my turn, asshole!

927
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:52,668
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

928
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,579
- I'm crashing!
- Down!

929
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:15,020
I'm back.

930
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,735
Let's go, honey.

931
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:24,234
Chief, we got 'em. We found 'em.

932
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:35,166
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Maxwell Potterdam the Third.

933
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,580
Maybe you've heard of me.

934
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,835
<i>California</i> magazine just
did a piece on me.

935
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:42,127
With the exception of being
misquoted several times,

936
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,555
I thought it was a
pretty good article.

937
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:50,219
Anyway, all that is...
unimportant.

938
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:55,766
This... is what's important.

939
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,731
Let's put these folks in the car

940
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:02,568
and go someplace a
little more noisy.

941
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,068
Come on, move it.

942
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:13,582
Hey

943
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:16,960
That's them.
Getting into that limo.

944
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:20,999
What the hell's goin' on?

945
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,630
I don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

946
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,872
I knew this was gonna get heavy.

947
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,088
A lot of good this thing
is gonna do us.

948
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,721
A Pellet gun?

949
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:12,808
You've been holding me hostage
all night with an air rifle?

950
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,478
- Shut up.
- This is too much.

951
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,018
We gotta find a way in there.

952
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,693
I... I got a plan.

953
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:32,695
That oughta do them.

954
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:36,537
I would love to see
those bastards try and top this.

955
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:42,047
I would pay a million pesos to see their
faces when they try to stop this baby.

956
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:45,754
Hey, pal, the next time
we see Carl and James,

957
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:49,007
it's gonna be Walt handing
them their walking papers.

958
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,383
Somebody's coming.

959
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:56,931
You, over there.

960
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:58,767
Come on!

961
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:04,356
- Come on, move it. Get up there.
- OK, OK, I'm going.

962
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,885
Oh we do live in
extraordinary times.

963
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:40,225
The lengths one has to go
to get the job done.

964
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,399
You're destroying the environment
and you don't even care.

965
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,604
How do you do it?
How do you live with yourself?

966
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,155
Gentlemen.

967
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,276
Although I'd prefer to dump you

968
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:57,037
along with the rest of this waste
at the bottom of the Pacific,

969
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:01,542
recent disruptions in our
operation have created a problem,

970
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:07,423
and now the Las Playas landfill
will become your final resting place.

971
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:10,255
- Buried alive?
- Oh, not to worry.

972
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,713
You'll probably run out of oxygen
before we reach the dump site.

973
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:18,467
Seal 'em up.

974
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,190
Hold on, everyone!

975
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:40,664
Hey!

976
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,546
Something's wrong.
We're not stopping.

977
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:50,128
- What?
- We're not stopping!

978
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,010
What the hell was that?

979
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:03,437
Why don't you move
your ass and find out?

980
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,601
No, you two stay.

981
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:07,058
I want those barrels sealed.
You two.

982
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,449
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

983
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,613
Oh, shit.

984
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,500
Get off of me.

985
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:56,941
Come on, let's go.

986
01:18:57,107 --> 01:19:00,236
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

987
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:05,704
I am not some kind of comic-book
superhero. I'm a pizza man.

988
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,499
- Stay here and keep an eye on him.
- Yeah, right.

989
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:34,229
I want the trucks
moving immediately.

990
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:38,070
I want every goddamn drop of
waste dumped before the sun rises.

991
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:39,821
OK, Mr. Potterdam.

992
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,085
Go this way!

993
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:44,973
JESUS!

994
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:48,518
Holy shit!

995
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,374
All right,
I'll pick it up on my way back.

996
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:17,589
- Hi, Carl.
- Hi, James. How are you?

997
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:19,796
Never better.

998
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,796
Susan! Come on.

999
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:41,234
Come on! We can't lose 'em!

1000
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,365
- We're not gonna make it.
- We'll make it.

1001
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,927
South Bay Security.
Freeze!

1002
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:16,482
Rent-a-cops.
I hate rent-a-cops too.

1003
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:32,206
Carl! What the hell are we doing?

1004
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,537
I think I love this girl.

1005
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,044
Really? How do you know?

1006
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,497
She let me feel the
bumps on her head.

1007
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,166
Whoa!

1008
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,300
- It looks like the bolt broke!
- No shit!

1009
01:22:53,093 --> 01:22:55,391
- Hang on.
- OK.

1010
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,021
Trees! Trees!

1011
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,570
- Carl!
- What?

1012
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:06,448
- How you doin' over there?
- Piece of cake.

1013
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,876
You need help.

1014
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,518
Carl!

1015
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:43,485
James!

1016
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,481
Hey! Carl!

1017
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,451
I think I got a
problem over here.

1018
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:54,155
All right, let me
think of something.

1019
01:23:56,573 --> 01:24:00,544
Hey, James, I didn't think
of anything yet.

1020
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:10,004
Hey, Carl! I definitely
got a problem over here!

1021
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:13,974
I'm coming.

1022
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:21,564
I got you!

1023
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:06,610
Mr. Potterdam?

1024
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,094
We're lookin' pretty
outnumbered here.

1025
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,599
I got an idea. Follow me.

1026
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:04,369
- What the hell are you doing?
- Protecting the environment.

1027
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,800
- Freeze.
- What are you...

1028
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:20,885
Everybody freeze or I
blow his head off!

1029
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:22,769
- He'll really do it.
- I'm not kiddin'.

1030
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:24,521
- Don't push him.
- I mean it.

1031
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,772
His whole head.

1032
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:28,935
You two with the weapons,
over the side. Do it now!

1033
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:40,408
Yeah, man, I know you.

1034
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,489
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking,

1035
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:45,167
"We got us another crazy
white boy with a gun."

1036
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,994
Well, let me tell you something,

1037
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:50,126
human life means very little
to me at this point in time.

1038
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:02,801
Relax, James, the cops are here.

1039
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:06,934
This is the police.
You all drop those weapons.

1040
01:27:10,726 --> 01:27:13,775
Yeah. Yeah, you!
You there with the pellet gun,

1041
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:17,692
drop it or I'll blow
your butt away for sure, buddy.

1042
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,496
A Pellet gun?

1043
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:32,005
You think we'd use a pellet
gun for something like this?

1044
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,548
Get 'em!

1045
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:42,515
I gotta find Susan.

1046
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:50,352
Susan!

1047
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:52,897
Susan!

1048
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,911
Uh-oh.

1049
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:10,501
Stop 'em before they get away!

1050
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:15,586
Susan! Susan!

1051
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:19,386
Susan!

1052
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:47,577
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
What-

1053
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,136
Help!

1054
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,260
Susan.

1055
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:11,392
Ow! Oh!

1056
01:29:23,525 --> 01:29:25,948
- Where are we?
- You don't wanna know.

1057
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:57,942
Carl! Carl, over here! Get down!

1058
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,874
Come on. Move out.

1059
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,378
Move! Everybody in the car.

1060
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:25,178
- Get in!
- Get the door open.

1061
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:29,599
- Start the car. Start the car!
- It won't start.

1062
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:34,054
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

1063
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,063
Move it, move it, move it!
Get out of the car!

1064
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:22,894
<i>Hi, let's have a play!</i>

1065
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,898
<i>Ouch! Be careful!</i>

1066
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:57,979
High five!

1067
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:06,901
Your car, sir.

1068
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,930
Smile, butthead.

1069
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,028
Whoa.

1070
01:33:47,997 --> 01:33:50,045
Hey, it's not what
it looks like.

1071
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,921
We're respectable
peace officers.

1072
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:58,308
It's just all one big,
funny mix-up.

1073
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,197
Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here!

1074
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,782
Get outta here!

1075
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:22,040
<i>Good morning! You're listening
to the Poorman on open-line.</i>

1076
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,417
<i>OK, we're gonna take
our next caller.</i>

1077
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:27,086
<i>Hello! You're on open-line.
Go ahead.</i>

1078
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,418
<i>Yeah, hi. My name's Stacey</i>

1079
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:33,006
<i>and I have a boyfriend who I've been
going out with for two years now.</i>

1080
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:36,088
<i>He works nights as a
delivery boy for a pizza place.</i>

1081
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,390
<i>And last night he
never came home</i>

1082
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,469
<i>and I am just positive that he is
out sleeping with another girl.</i>

1083
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:45,021
<i>Well, I think you should
definitely dump the dude!</i>
