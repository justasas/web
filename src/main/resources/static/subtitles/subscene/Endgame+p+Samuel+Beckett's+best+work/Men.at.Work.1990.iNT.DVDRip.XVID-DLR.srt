1
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,274
I can't support
this activity any longer, Max.

2
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,598
Relax, Jack. Only two more days and we
move our whole disposal operation north -

3
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,472
out of your jurisdiction.

4
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,559
You promised me those barrels'd
be leakproof for 150 years.

5
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,958
A slight miscalculation.
Look, it's this simple.

6
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,199
I have an obligation
to produce paint thinner.

7
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,474
You have an obligation to provide
a place to dispose of the waste products.

8
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,990
I'm not afraid of you any more, Potterdam.

9
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,591
If I have to expose the whole operation,
I will. I'll bring us all down.

10
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,269
I think you're smarter than that, Jack.

11
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,755
You can't pay me enough, Max.

12
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,551
Kiss your chances of getting elected
mayor goodbye, Mr. City Councilman.

13
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,319
It's bigger than an election, Max.

14
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,915
Boss?

15
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,318
There's a time and a place
for everything, gentlemen.

16
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,515
<i>You have an obligation to provide</i>
<i>a place to dispose of the waste products.</i>

17
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,959
I got you.

18
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,474
<i> Good morning. You're listening to</i>
<i>the Poor man on the world-famous KROQ.</i>

19
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,194
<i>And you still have time</i>
<i>to call in on open-line,</i>

20
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,676
<i>where at 5am, let's face it,</i>
<i>we can talk about absolutely anything.</i>

21
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,270
<i>It's live, it's uncensored,</i>
<i>and I'm not even using the tape delay</i>

22
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,391
<i>because this is primetime radio,</i>

23
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,718
<i>the 2 to 6am show</i>
<i>where management sleeps.</i>

24
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,796
I gotta go to work.

25
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,515
Could you leave your board?
I may go out later.

26
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,276
My surfboard?

27
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,559
Yeah. You promised me last night.

28
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,712
Yeah, you can use it.

29
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,799
<i>No tape delay. Here we are on open-line.</i>
<i>Good morning. You're on the air.</i>

30
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,275
<i>- Hi, Poorman.</i>
<i>- Where are you calling from?</i>

31
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,675
<i>- South Bay.</i>
<i>- What can I do for you?</i>

32
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,318
<i>Well, my boyfriend just left me and</i>
<i>I'm really bummed cos I loved him a lot.</i>

33
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,749
<i>Why did your boyfriend leave you?</i>

34
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,952
<i>He found me and his best friend</i>
<i>in bed together.</i>

35
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,390
<i>What do you expect if he found you</i>
<i>in bed with his best friend?</i>

36
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,557
<i>I don't know. Maybe a bit more</i>
<i>understanding, you know.</i>

37
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,195
<i>Well, you got a problem</i>
<i>that you're gonna have to work out.</i>

38
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,356
<i>But not on my show.</i>

39
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,471
I hate politicians.

40
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,910
Yeah.

41
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,951
<i>Coming to work today, Mr. Taylor?</i>

42
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,038
Yeah, Walt,
I'm flyin' out the door right now.

43
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,552
Let's see if my favorite
little stewardess is up yet.

44
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,071
Lookin' good.

45
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,235
Oops!

46
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,237
Busted.

47
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,950
Fly those friendly skies.

48
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,029
Now that is the perfect relationship.

49
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,670
Wait a minute. Hello.

50
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,555
What are you looking at, pal?

51
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,038
Good morning.

52
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,395
Time for that morning cup of hot java.
Coffee for one. Three scoops, please.

53
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,193
Nice selection of wines.

54
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,835
Good California Chardonnay,
a bottle of Dom.

55
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,793
No market brands in this house.

56
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,876
Only the best.

57
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,675
Now for some sliced papaya,
if it's in season.

58
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,757
Shit! Mango. I should have known.

59
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,396
I wish I knew your name.

60
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,589
Carl. I thought you were
gonna be a no-show.

61
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,075
Almost. Thanks.

62
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,796
Frost and Luzinski?

63
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,510
Yeah.

64
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,909
Hey, I don't know about you, shitheads,
but we're on a time clock. Let's move!

65
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,078
Gina walked out on me last night.

66
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,192
- Really?
- Yeah. Moved all her stuff out.

67
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,551
You've been trying to bale out
of that relationship for a long time.

68
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,148
I just didn't expect it
to be so sudden.

69
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,676
Paybacks are a bitch, James!

70
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,309
- You seen my gloves, amigo?
- In the glove <i>compartimente.</i>

71
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,233
- Hey, mister!
- Shut up, you dickhead.

72
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,751
Yes, I'm still here.
Now, about those mailers.

73
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,793
First off, you did the colors wrong,
but I let it pass because I'm a nice person.

74
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,390
Now you're telling me, with the
election one week around the corner,

75
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,432
that the mailers are gonna go out late?

76
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,157
If you don't get those mailers out
by tomorrow, I'm pulling the account.

77
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,032
Bye-bye.

78
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,275
Jerk.

79
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,916
I gotta hide this.

80
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,833
- A ton of things need your signature.
- Can it wait?

81
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,270
No, and I have a cassette of a band
we could use for the fundraiser.

82
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,472
Since we're short on time,
you could listen and decide.

83
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,479
I don't have time for that. If you like 'em,
use 'em. I trust your judgment.

84
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,354
That's why I hired you as a campaign
manager. You gotta trust your staff.

85
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,835
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

86
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,031
Listen...

87
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,118
- You're doing a hell of a job.
- Thank you, Jack.

88
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,079
- I didn't sleep for shit last night.
- Why not?

89
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,599
Gina.

90
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,280
Gina, Gina. Gina!

91
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,915
Let her go, man. Let her go.

92
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,793
I have, I have. She is historical.

93
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,153
She couldn't be with
a garbageman the rest of her life.

94
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,239
You're not gonna be a garbageman.
Didn't you tell her about our surf shop?

95
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,239
I told her. I think she was getting
pressure from her family.

96
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,636
- Her father never liked you.
- What does he know?

97
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,116
- Well, life's a bitch, right?
- Ain't that the truth!

98
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,790
I tell you, Carl, this is
the last year we throw trash.

99
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,309
- You said that last year.
- This year I mean it.

100
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,396
You meant it last year.

101
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,599
- Hey, Carl, is this yours?
- No, it ain't my color.

102
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,116
It's a bra, James.

103
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,636
Look at this smut.

104
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,793
Well, if it isn't the South Bay's finest.

105
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,992
What happened, Mike?
Did they take away your vroom-vrooms?

106
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,272
You see, this is the kind of scum you're
gonna have to get used to around here.

107
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,551
Jeff's new to the force,
so I'm giving him the tour.

108
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,391
He's also my new partner, so you're
gonna be seeing a whole lot more of him.

109
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,750
Wonderful.

110
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,871
You're gonna like it here, Jeff.

111
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,117
The air's clean, the women are beautiful
and the shifts are short.

112
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,553
Most of the folks here in Las Playas
are hard-working, with a future in mind,

113
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,830
with the exception of these two clowns.

114
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,158
They're part of the
"Don't let this happen to you" crowd.

115
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,113
A word of warning,
my garbage-toting friends,

116
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,993
from your friendly
neighborhood peace officer.

117
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,079
I've got my eye on you both.
If you're not breaking the law now,

118
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,193
the smart money says that
it's only a matter of time before you will.

119
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,269
And you can bet that last dollar that my
ass is gonna be there to make the bust.

120
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,237
- Golf clap?
- Golf clap.

121
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,391
"Dear John. I'm sorry
things didn't work out for us."

122
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,717
"You're a sweet man,
and I'll always love you."

123
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,353
Ah!

124
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,717
You know, this is the kind of shit
that really breaks me up.

125
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,796
- It's an epidemic.
- What is?

126
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,071
Just women, relationships, all of it.

127
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,589
I never have a problem with it.

128
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,676
- Hi, James.
- Morning, baby.

129
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,194
- That's cos you've got no heart.
- What?

130
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,793
You've got no heart. Who was
the last girl you were serious about?

131
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,110
Betsy Sabetta.

132
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,199
Betsy Sabetta? That was
in the ninth grade and she had a harelip.

133
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,276
- She did not.
- She did too.

134
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,073
- She did not!
- Did too, did too.

135
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,317
- What do you know about her, anyway?
- I know she had a harelip.

136
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,832
What an absolutely gorgeous day.

137
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,315
Warm sun, beautiful women.

138
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,313
And the air is just right for drinking.

139
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,549
Would you just look at all the activity
that's going on down here, Carl.

140
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,116
It's close, man. I can see it.

141
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,595
Right here, right on the strand.

142
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,188
Carl and James' Surf Shop.

143
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,993
It's gold. It's gold, James. It's a gold mine.

144
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,352
Just think of the garbage business
as a way station on the road to nirvana.

145
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,439
Maybe now you're single again, you'll be
able to put more time and energy into it.

146
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,439
Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on, wait a minute, just a second.

147
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,155
I have put a lot of energy
into getting our surf shop together.

148
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,558
And we'd be a lot further along
if I didn't have to do the work of two.

149
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,799
Pardon me? Let's not forget that I chose
the bank that we went to to get our loan.

150
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,990
We didn't even get the loan.

151
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,829
It's not like you researched it. You picked
the name out of the Yellow Pages.

152
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,030
What exactly are...

153
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,355
Good God!

154
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,391
What exactly are you trying to say?

155
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:35,029
What I'm trying to say, James, is that
sometimes you are completely hopeless.

156
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,796
- Really?
- Yes.

157
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,715
- Hey, Carl.
- Yeah.

158
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,197
- What exactly did you mean by hopeless?
- I meant exactly what I said.

159
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,788
I still don't understand.

160
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,990
Well, let's examine the word.

161
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,989
Hope less. Less than hopeful.
That's what you are.

162
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,957
But am I majorly hopeless
or partially hopeless?

163
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,629
I would say majorly. Why do you ask?

164
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,593
- I'll try to change.
- No, you won't.

165
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,397
I need to talk to you, Leo.

166
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,397
Hi. Nice to see you.

167
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,034
I need your help on something, Leo.

168
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,472
I know who's responsible for
the toxic dumping off Las Playas,

169
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,795
and I'm kind of involved.

170
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,069
Jesus, Jack.

171
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,873
I just never thought it would go this far.

172
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,436
Look, it's all on the tape. Listen to this.

173
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,070
What is this? Some kind of a joke?

174
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,668
This is not the right tape.

175
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,155
She took the wrong tape!

176
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,354
- What are you talking about?
- The wrong tape!

177
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,799
Hey, wait a minute.

178
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,074
Come on. Let's do the nasty.

179
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,035
- Do we have to?
- Yeah, afraid so.

180
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,076
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

181
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,391
- Nasty!
- Nasty!

182
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,953
Yeah, Dalton here. Listen,
Jack Berger was in here earlier today.

183
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,959
Claimed he knew who was responsible
for those Las Playas offshore dumpings.

184
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,674
Claimed he had some kind
of a tape that could prove it.

185
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,157
I don't know. This might be nothing,
but I thought you should know.

186
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,719
You did the right thing, Captain. I'm sure
it's nothing, but I appreciate the call.

187
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,796
<i>- Any time.</i>
- Thank you.

188
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,198
A tape.

189
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,196
A goddamn tape.

190
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,070
Shrewd move, Berger.

191
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,879
Hey, boys! Where's your originality, huh?

192
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,957
This means war, man.

193
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,469
Hey, this is shit. It's shit!

194
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,434
Get it off me, Frost! Get it off!
It's shit! It's shit!

195
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,233
It's payback time, you little shits!

196
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,636
Gentlemen, inside now.

197
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,110
- What's up, Walt?
- Nothing too serious today.

198
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,074
I got a complaint about banging trash
cans on P Street at 6am this morning.

199
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,873
- You boys know anything about this?
- No, sir.

200
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,237
Who rolled the bowling ball
down the alley into Avenue H?

201
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,078
Can't help you there either.

202
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,634
In the two years you have worked here,

203
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,719
you have broken every city ordinance
that pertains to this line of work.

204
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,513
Well, you can't say
we haven't been a lot of laughs.

205
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,359
I'm glad you have a sense of humor,
Mr. St James.

206
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,234
Unfortunately, the majority
of the people in this community do not.

207
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,275
Now me, personally, I like you boys.

208
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,075
Which is why
I'm giving you another chance.

209
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,113
Starting tomorrow, you boys
will be riding with a third party.

210
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,276
What?

211
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,393
I have decided to send an observer
along with you on your route.

212
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,829
A representative of Shoreline.

213
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,713
- Who's the observer?
- My brother-in-law.

214
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,116
Consider yourselves on probation.

215
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,028
I suggest you be on your best behavior.

216
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,471
The nerve of Walt, sending us
on our route with a goddamn baby-sitter.

217
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,556
Don't worry about it.

218
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,309
What does a... phrenologist
feel and interpret?

219
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,115
- The size of Walt's asshole.
- Wrong.

220
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,190
No, a phrenologist feels and interprets
the bumps on your head, skull features.

221
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,675
Very good.

222
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,271
Who was Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff
during the final days of Watergate?

223
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,675
Oprah Winfrey.

224
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,110
No, that was... Alexander Haig.

225
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,156
That's right.

226
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,796
What does gasoline...

227
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,194
Jack! Jack!

228
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,596
The tape!
What did you do with the tape?

229
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,791
Jesus Christ!

230
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,918
- What are you doing?
- I hate shitheads who bully their women.

231
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,277
- So what are you gonna do?
- Shoot him.

232
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,470
- What?
- It's the principle, James.

233
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,592
With a pellet gun? What are you
gonna accomplish using that?

234
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,188
It allows me to seriously
aggravate a situation

235
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,073
without actually changing
the course of history.

236
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,760
It also stings like a bitch.

237
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,277
Well, I'm glad that's over.

238
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,956
Carl, what are you doing?
Everything's cool now.

239
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,277
Mister, it's nothing personal.

240
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,635
- Where do you think you got him?
- Butt shot.

241
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,115
He'll never lay a hand on her again.

242
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,635
Asshole! I wouldn't have
voted for you anyway.

243
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,228
- Stop it! Stop it!
- What?

244
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,353
Shoot him in the head,
his head's all over the place.

245
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,430
Touchdown! The tape! Touchdown!

246
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,516
Genius.

247
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,995
Man, this guy's really heavy.
I gotta start working out.

248
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,680
- You should go to the gym.
- I hate weights.

249
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,439
- You work on your cardiovascular.
- What's that?

250
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,869
- Get on one of those life cycles.
- What's that?

251
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,560
- Stationary bike.
- Yeah? How are they?

252
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,708
They're great. They got... cross-country
skiing machines, things where you row.

253
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,638
Come on, get him in there. I wanna go eat.

254
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,796
Come on, come on, come on.

255
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,279
I got it. Start the car.

256
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,231
Right, Jack, I have the tape.

257
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,112
Jack?

258
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,115
Jack?

259
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,877
Touch that again
and I swear to God, I'll kill you.

260
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,956
What'd I do?

261
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,396
Let's go a little bit faster, see if
you can put me through the windshield.

262
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,836
Where the hell am I?

263
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,554
Time for work. Boy, oh boy!

264
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,756
James, do us both a favor.

265
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,276
Whatever you do,

266
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,912
don't give this observer guy
a hard time today.

267
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,558
I figure if we behave ourselves,

268
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,393
show him that
we're a couple of good guys,

269
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,114
we'll get him out of our hair a lot quicker.

270
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,632
OK.

271
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,396
For all we know...

272
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,038
he could be some crazed combat veteran.

273
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,035
You're driving too fast.

274
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,835
So, Louis, you're Walt’s brother-in-law.
That's great. Speaks highly of you.

275
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,951
What do you know about anything?

276
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,036
Walt’s a nice guy.

277
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,120
His sister must be nice too.
I've never met her.

278
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,834
When I feel like talking to you,
I will look at you.

279
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,916
Gotcha.

280
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,792
You writing stuff about us? Sorry. Sorry.

281
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,556
This sucks.

282
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,596
What did you say, son?

283
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,676
The name is James.

284
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,909
Well, James,
if you expect to keep this job,

285
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,271
I suggest you tell me what it was
you were mumbling over there.

286
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,356
James.

287
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,799
I said this sucks.

288
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,876
And, basically, so do you.

289
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,357
You little... I'll show you
not to talk to me like that!

290
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,436
Hey, hey! Goddammit!

291
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,557
This Louis guy's a total nightmare.

292
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,036
He's not playin' around,
let me tell you, James.

293
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,680
Yeah, I feel really bad about that, Carl.

294
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,954
Probably not as bad as I do.

295
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,829
- James, promise me something.
- What?

296
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,758
No matter what you do,
do not provoke this guy.

297
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,029
- Promise.
- I'm serious.

298
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,116
I promise.

299
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,998
- How's that nose?
- It's OK.

300
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,633
I still owe one to the intended receiver.

301
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,069
You know, man,
you're a total pain in the a...

302
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,829
Now, James, Louis is gonna be with us
for the next couple of weeks.

303
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,837
Accept this as fact.

304
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,919
Why don't you guys shake hands
and stop behaving like children?

305
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,115
Put it on the back of your neck.

306
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,109
There are several sacred things in
this world that you don't ever mess with.

307
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,152
One of them happens to be
another man's fries.

308
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,955
Now, you remember that
and you'll live a long and healthy life.

309
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,876
James.

310
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,911
- James.
- What?

311
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,474
You better get over here
and take a look at this.

312
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,955
What is it, Carl?

313
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,196
Just take a look.

314
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,559
- What the hell is this, Carl?
- It's a dead human being, James.

315
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,831
Yeah? What's he doin' on our route?

316
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,829
Oh, looky here. Looks like somebody
threw away a perfectly good white boy.

317
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,115
And he sure looks
a hell of a lot like that dude.

318
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,156
We're screwed.

319
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,438
What do you mean "we"?
You pulled the trigger, pal.

320
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,630
Look, Louis, we gotta talk.

321
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,433
You see, Louis,
Carl sort of knows this guy.

322
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,073
- So?
- I don't know him at all.

323
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,272
- What I'm trying to say is he shot him.
- With a pellet gun.

324
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,630
- But he thought he hit him in the butt.
- I did.

325
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,718
You two seem to be
in some serious shit here.

326
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,114
I need a drink.

327
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,676
Look, Louis, I know
that I did not kill this man.

328
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,237
This guy was beatin' on his old lady,
so I took upon myself to end the dispute.

329
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,476
- So you shot him?
- With a pellet gun.

330
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,556
So you said.

331
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,031
- And you shot him from where?
- From my apartment.

332
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,674
So how in the hell did he end up here?

333
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,756
Why don't you ask him?

334
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,317
- Have some. It'll settle your nerves.
- My nerves don't need settling!

335
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,079
What is the maximum sentence
for murder?

336
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,988
I did not murder anyone! Jesus Christ,
James, whose side are you on?

337
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,078
- I am not taking sides.
- You've already convicted me.

338
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,316
I'm on my way to death row.

339
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,714
Carl, come on.

340
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,115
Let me tell you,
you are in it as much as I am.

341
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,993
You were there.
That makes you an accomplice.

342
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,396
Look, you bastard, I never
wanted you to do it. I was against it.

343
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,399
- Try explaining that to the judge.
- I'm not explaining anything to any judge.

344
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,353
- This is your ball game, Carl.
- You are an asshole!

345
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,631
- You are a trigger-happy idiot!
- I will not rot in prison alone.

346
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,877
You're not gonna mess up my life,
you son of a bitch!

347
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,228
Hey!

348
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,555
You and your stupid pellet gun!

349
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,516
- Get off of me!
- I'll kill you!

350
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,438
You're a stupid man!
You're a stupid little man!

351
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,154
I said enough! I said cut it out!

352
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,033
Hey, you! I said knock it off!

353
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,399
Now look, unless one of you two guys
took a piece of rope or a piece of wire

354
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,034
and strangled this guy,
you're both in the clear.

355
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,515
How the hell do you know?

356
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,149
You can tell by the marks on his neck.
Look at that.

357
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,714
Pretty sloppy job, too.

358
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,389
Not a great idea to keep him
out in the open like this.

359
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,479
I don't like this, Carl.
I don't like this one bit.

360
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,909
- I'm goin' to the cops.
- What?

361
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,996
Looks like they're comin' to us.

362
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,276
I hate cops.

363
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,111
Well, well. Another fine day
in the dumps, eh, fellas?

364
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,595
Who are your friends?
I've never seen you around here before.

365
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,676
Louis here works for the company.

366
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,316
He'll be ridin' with us for the next
couple of weeks to police our activities.

367
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,713
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir, Officer, sir.

368
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,070
- What about you?
- He's...

369
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,555
I didn't ask you, garbageman.

370
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,638
I'm asking the punk who looks like
he's had a few too many.

371
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,832
What the hell's the matter with him?
He looks friggin' dead.

372
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,036
Well, the boy's had a rough night.
He's, you know, a... cousin of James.

373
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,951
He flew in from... Texas. We were
out late showin' him a good time.

374
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,868
Wherever he's from, he shouldn't be
out on the street in his condition.

375
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,312
I could haul you in, you know. But for now
I'm just gonna give you a warning.

376
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,035
- That's very kind of you, Officer.
- Yeah, it is.

377
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,119
Get him inside that truck and make sure
he stays there until he sobers up.

378
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,232
- Do I make myself clear?
- Crystal, sir. Let's go.

379
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,476
Not so fast.

380
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,313
I've got the whole Las Playas police
department clued into you two bozos.

381
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,396
You may have escaped me this time,

382
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,149
and all I can say is
"Relish this moment, gentlemen."

383
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,272
This is wrong. This is just wrong, wrong,
wrong! We should have just told them.

384
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,436
Told them what?

385
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,596
That we found a body in the trash

386
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,110
that just happened to be Jack Berger,
the man I shot with a pellet gun?

387
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,189
Are you nuts? Those guys are
lookin' for any excuse to put us away.

388
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,678
Let's get outta here. We'll stash the body,
get back to work and figure this out later.

389
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,360
Son of a bitch!

390
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,789
I can't believe this. We lost the body.

391
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,150
Hey, relax. We didn't lose the body.

392
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,078
It's in a big yellow can.
How can we miss it?

393
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,316
What do you mean, you've lost the body?

394
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,750
It just kind of fell out
of the back of the car.

395
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,074
Well.

396
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,670
- Find it! Find it, find it, find it, find it!
- Yes, sir.

397
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,439
Your very lives
depend upon it, gentlemen.

398
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,228
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- Sir, we did find the tape.

399
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,512
Oh.

400
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,196
Thank God.

401
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,276
You're excused.

402
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,590
- Wait a minute. The girl.
- What girl?

403
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,030
- The girl we saw Berger fighting with.
- What about her?

404
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,118
Well, maybe she had
something to do with his death.

405
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,392
Yeah, so she strangles him, stuffs him in a
barrel and dumps him on the esplanade?

406
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,954
It makes a lot of sense, Carl.

407
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,236
You know...

408
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,560
That stiff's startin' to get a little gamy.
You guys come up with anything?

409
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,036
Carl seems to think that
Berger's girl is somehow involved.

410
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,188
The last time we saw Berger alive was
in that fight across from my apartment.

411
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,118
- It's not enough to go on.
- It's a place to start.

412
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,869
How about going to the police? What
we should have done in the first place.

413
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,639
Carl's right. It's a place to start.

414
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,630
We're not gonna accomplish
a goddamn thing standing around here.

415
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,672
So you guys are either
with me or you're not.

416
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,800
I thought you knew how to rig that thing.

417
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,835
I followed the instructions.

418
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,750
Anything good
to eat in this place?

419
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,476
- I could order us a pizza.
- Sounds great. Pepperoni, extra cheese.

420
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,878
Maybe we should put old Milhous
someplace a little less visible.

421
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,675
I need a large pepperoni, extra cheese,

422
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,635
to 828 Esplanade, apartment 405.

423
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,035
Last name, Taylor.

424
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,116
Yeah.

425
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,276
OK, what's the total on that?

426
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,999
Hey, Carl.

427
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,153
Hello.

428
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,636
She hardly looks like
a cold-blooded killer.

429
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,075
What now, hotshot?

430
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,509
How about goin' over there and tellin' her

431
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,599
that we got her boyfriend's
dead body sittin' in our shitter?

432
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,316
What are we gonna do?

433
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,070
Stand here watching her like
a bunch of long-distance Peeping Toms?

434
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,430
No.

435
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,949
- I'm goin' over there.
- What?

436
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,150
- I'm goin' over there.
- What for?

437
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,068
I don't know. Snoop around,
see what I can come up with.

438
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,716
Carl, this is not some game. What if
she didn't have anything to do with this?

439
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,038
Gee, James, you sound as if
you're really worried about me.

440
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,709
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- I'm not gonna get in over my head.

441
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,832
Well, that depends on
which head you're talkin' about.

442
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,636
Look, we got your back. If anything funny
happens, don't be too shy to scream.

443
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,513
OK. Save me a slice.

444
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,680
Do you know where
he keeps that gun of his?

445
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,990
What is he doing?

446
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,076
What am I doing?

447
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,916
Uh-oh.

448
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,078
- Don't kill me!
- What?

449
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,156
What? I'm sorry.

450
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,516
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I've never been better.

451
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,158
- Do you live here in the...
- I'm sorry if I...

452
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,236
You first.

453
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,069
- Do you live here in the building?
- Yes, I do live here in the building.

454
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,555
For five years I've been in the building.

455
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,558
That's funny.
I've never seen you here before.

456
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,717
Well, I lead a very... private life.

457
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,559
I'm a... a... phrenologist.

458
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,640
What exactly does a phrenologist do?

459
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,039
Well, I feel and interpret the size of
Walt’s asshole... I mean, skull features.

460
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,276
Wow.

461
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,871
Not to impose, but if we can go inside and
put some ice on this ankle, it'd be great.

462
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,434
- Inside where?
- Your apartment.

463
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,516
What's the matter with yours?

464
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,077
No, my ice machine is broken,
and yours is right here.

465
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,591
Are you gonna refuse a wounded man
in dire need of medical attention?

466
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,316
- No.
- Thanks.

467
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,995
- But I didn't catch your name.
- I'm Ted Blanston, the third.

468
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,156
Susan Wilkins, the first.

469
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,317
He's inside.
He's inside her apartment.

470
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,276
Out that light.

471
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,194
What the hell's Carl doing?

472
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,790
- I don't like this, man. I do not like this.
- Shh.

473
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,555
Asshole!

474
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,798
The hell with this. I'm callin' the police.

475
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,075
No cops. I hate cops.

476
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,156
I'm sorry, which ankle was it?

477
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,516
It's the swollen one.

478
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,718
- I really appreciate this.
- It's no trouble.

479
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,200
Are you friendly with the Cottlers?

480
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,550
- I think...
- Second floor?

481
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,274
- Ron and Ann?
- Oh, sure.

482
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,073
Well, I figured, since you're both doctors.

483
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,430
Right. We're all doctors.

484
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,192
Where do you practice?

485
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,757
I got a small office down
in the medical district and...

486
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,474
You know, I could really use a drink.

487
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,716
- Just one.
- Me too.

488
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,276
Thanks.

489
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,712
- Sorry.
- I could have brought it to you.

490
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,677
Thank you.

491
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,755
It's for the pain.

492
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,396
I rarely touch the stuff.
Can I have another one?

493
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,671
I don't believe this.
They're doin' shots, for Christ's sake.

494
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,518
I can't believe I've never met you before.

495
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,717
I thought I knew everyone
who lived in this building.

496
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,877
Well, as I said, I lead a very private life.

497
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,036
Very private life. Yeah.

498
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,955
You know, you're a very beautiful woman.

499
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,273
No, I mean that. I've always thought so.

500
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,152
What do you mean, always?

501
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,319
What I meant was that
you've probably always been beautiful

502
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,069
and it's a shame that
I'm just now discovering this.

503
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,750
Oh.

504
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,519
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.

505
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,311
Well, you did.
You wanna switch to champagne?

506
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,231
Sure, if the Dom Perignon is chilled,
that'd be perfect.

507
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,715
How did you know I had Dom?

508
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,675
How did I know you had Dom?
Doesn't everybody?

509
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,714
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom, Louis.

510
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,151
Jesus! Carl spends the evening
with a beautiful woman

511
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,556
and I'm stuck here
with a lunatic and a corpse.

512
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,830
I don't believe this guy.

513
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,875
I can't do this with you starin' at me.

514
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,680
- Who is it?
- Pedro's Pizza and Pancakes.

515
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,476
Yeah!

516
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,712
OK.

517
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,593
- Large pepperoni, extra cheese.
- That's us.

518
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,473
- How much?
- Eight bucks.

519
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,073
OK. One, two,

520
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,350
three, four...

521
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,274
- What's going on here?
- Mind your own business.

522
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,277
OK. Thank you, sir.

523
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,595
You've seen too much.

524
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,358
- What the hell are you doing?
- He saw you with the body.

525
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,438
- He could start trouble.
- So you kidnap him? Good solution.

526
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,757
Here, take the money.
I won't say anything to anybody!

527
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,632
You bet you won't!

528
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,716
What the hell?

529
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,190
Extra cheese?

530
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,677
- You're a madman.
- He was provoking me.

531
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,110
This situation has definitely
gotten way out of hand.

532
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,800
Get back to that window
and keep Carl covered.

533
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,959
- What the hell do we do with him?
- We need some rope.

534
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,436
Are you gonna get this or what?

535
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,591
Hello?

536
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,429
First, you lose the body,

537
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,438
and then you deliver me the wrong tape.

538
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,552
Now, I don't think that
either of you personally

539
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,752
set out to destroy my company.

540
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,829
But I sent you out on a simple task.
And, simply put, you loused it up.

541
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,874
Now, apparently,

542
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,676
Berger had a special relationship
with his campaign manager,

543
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,157
a Susan Wilkins, 825 Esplanade.

544
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,272
That's where we iced Berger, chief.
I know where that is.

545
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,789
Well...

546
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,118
Did it ever occur to you two idiots
that she might have the cassette?

547
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,475
I think he wants us
to kill some more people.

548
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,033
OK.

549
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,156
If I had my 16,
I could pick her off so easily.

550
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,794
This is good. Did you make it?

551
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,710
<i>... reporting from Hanoi Hilton.</i>
<i>Yankee dogs, you might as well give up.</i>

552
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,673
<i>The war is lost. Jane Fonda was right.</i>

553
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,314
Are you hungry? Would you like some?

554
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,512
- Don't give him any, James.
- Why not? He might be hungry.

555
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,918
He's a prisoner,
and he should be treated accordingly.

556
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,275
Have you completely lost your mind?

557
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,358
We're not soldiers and he's not
the enemy. He's a pizza man.

558
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,436
Back in Phu Bai,

559
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,751
he would have been killed
the second he knocked on that door.

560
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,668
I would've snapped his neck like a twig.
He never would've seen it coming.

561
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,952
- Louis, Louis, calm down.
- The commie bastard gets no food!

562
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,479
Yeah.

563
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,875
Yes, indeed.

564
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,230
That is deep.

565
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,316
That is definitely deep.

566
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,516
Yes.

567
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,830
Hm.

568
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,916
That's an interesting one.

569
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,956
So is that one.

570
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,995
You were born through Caesarean, no?

571
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,037
- No.
- It's not an exact science, of course.

572
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,515
Apparently not.

573
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,713
Mangoes. You love mangoes.

574
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,036
- How did you know that?
- Well, it's all here in the contours.

575
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,916
Yeah.

576
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,114
So, that's phrenology.

577
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,356
It's fascinating, no?

578
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,630
No. Weird.

579
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,719
You know what? First, let's take this off.

580
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,599
And let's do something.

581
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:00,999
- We are doing something.
- Let's get out of here and do something.

582
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,271
- Like what?
- I don't know, but it'll be fun.

583
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,278
Why this sudden burst of energy?
My ankle's killing me.

584
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,356
Come on.

585
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,116
- You want me to get this?
- Oh.

586
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,110
Do you always look in people's trash?

587
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,038
Well, sometimes it's the best way
to get to know 'em.

588
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,234
No, no, no. I wanna report
a murder and a kidnapping.

589
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,510
<i>- Murder and a kidnapping.</i>
- That's right.

590
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,757
<i>- Did they take the body?</i>
- No, no, no. I have the body.

591
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,394
<i>- Did you kill the victim?</i>
- No, I didn't kill him.

592
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,990
<i>- Have you been kidnapped?</i>
- I'm not the one who's been kidnapped.

593
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,510
- I know this sounds strange...
<i>- I don't think we can help you, sir.</i>

594
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,428
Well, fuck me! Isn't that what the police
are supposed to do - help people?

595
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,676
I am telling you...

596
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,315
They're leaving. Let's go.

597
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,599
Dammit!

598
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,190
Let's move it! Come on!

599
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,677
The pizza clown goes with us.
Get him on his feet. I'll get Tricky Dick.

600
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,316
I want you to know, James,
this is all going on my report.

601
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,591
That's great, Louis.
Just make sure you spell my name right.

602
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,915
Don't cross me, James.

603
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,599
All right, let's whack this broad
and get the tape.

604
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,674
Jesus Christ. That's Berger.

605
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,076
What the hell?

606
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,436
Get back here, you goof.

607
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,677
- Who's the kid in the clown suit?
- I don't know.

608
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,554
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, Christ!

609
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,871
Those bastards are gonna pay.

610
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,956
Oh, yeah. They're payin'.

611
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,872
Yo!

612
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,118
There's the broad. There goes the broad.

613
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,874
Come on, come on, come on, you moron.

614
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,870
Are we late for something?

615
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,395
- Faster, James, faster.
- I got it to the floor, Louis.

616
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,515
- Who are those guys?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?

617
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,718
And where do these guys
get off, takin' our body?

618
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,475
Come on, we're losing 'em.

619
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,036
Oh, Christ.

620
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,508
- Oh, shit.
- I've almost been waiting for this.

621
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,996
Now you see this here?
This complicates things.

622
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,429
I just don't like killing cops too much.

623
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,711
Forget about the body.
They're the ones drivin' around with it.

624
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,072
I say we stay with the girl.
Potterdam says she might have the tape.

625
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,431
Biff, help me, all right.
Who just died and made you king?

626
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,677
Hey, Mario, how about this?
Your mother did.

627
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,429
Don't you ever say anything,
ever, about my mother.

628
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,199
Your mother did, your mother did. Mario!

629
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,033
- How do we handle this?
- Just pull over.

630
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,873
OK, everybody. Act natural.

631
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,596
Well, well, well. Look who we got here.

632
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,031
I am in no mood for this right now, Mike.

633
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,118
Just write up the ticket
so we can all get on with our lives.

634
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,312
Well, I might not be able
to let you off so easy there, Jimbo.

635
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,672
See, you were doing 65 in a 35,
and you ran a red light.

636
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,471
That's reckless driving
as far as I'm concerned.

637
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,160
Who else you got
in there with you, Jimbo?

638
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,318
What the hell is going on in here?

639
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,473
You're... you're never
gonna believe this, Mike.

640
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,593
I... we, uh...

641
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,668
I'm totally floundering.
I can't even come up with a good lie.

642
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,109
What'd I tell you, James?

643
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,677
I knew you were crooked and I knew
I'd catch up to you sooner or later.

644
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,795
Everybody out of the vehicle right now.

645
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,831
- Don't do it!
- Don't shoot!

646
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,635
- He's got a gun.
- Don't shoot! Please, don't shoot!

647
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,672
Yeah, cop. I know you, man.

648
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,839
I know what you're thinking. "We got us
another crazy nigger here with a gun."

649
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,397
Well, let me tell you, human life means
very little to me at this point in time.

650
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,435
You see, I thrive on misery.
In the jungle, misery's all you got.

651
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,235
But things are different back here
in the world, or so they seem.

652
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,397
Nobody wants to talk about
pain and suffering.

653
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,593
Everybody wants
everything to be nice and civil.

654
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:55,158
Well, OK, then. Let's be nice. Let's be civil.

655
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,513
Drop those guns before I pull this trigger
and change the way you feel about me.

656
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,793
Will the officer to the rear of the truck
kindly drop his revolver as well?

657
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,508
You know, you cops must really think
I'm as dumb as you look.

658
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,519
Now, don't you know that
when a flashlight hits the cement,

659
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,076
it makes a completely
different sound than a revolver?

660
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,839
Let's be good boys,
and do exactly as I say.

661
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:43,679
OK, now, I want Mr. Sneaky Man to come
around and join his partner, Mr. Bonehead.

662
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,870
Sorry, guys.

663
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:02,430
You will swing for this, James.
I shit you not!

664
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,314
I don't know, boys, but they look
pretty goddamn sweet to me.

665
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,076
What do you think?

666
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,070
What do you think?

667
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,070
How you doing?

668
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,430
I'm OK.

669
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,155
I think my body's gone into shock
from all the alcohol.

670
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,236
I'd like to sit down, actually.

671
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,316
What was that for?

672
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,996
You didn't like it.

673
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,315
No, I liked it... a lot.

674
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,396
Then shut up.

675
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:54,035
It feels like we're drivin' in circles.
Carl could be anywhere.

676
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,516
You want some?

677
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,114
Promise you're not gonna scream
and cry if I take that gag off?

678
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,914
Now, if you're lyin',
Louis'll have to bash you.

679
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,996
You do understand, don't you?

680
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,956
Thank you. Thank you.

681
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,473
- It needs sugar.
- What?

682
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,556
Nothing.

683
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,196
It's not lookin' too good, is it?

684
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,558
- You givin' up?
- I never give up.

685
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,715
I never have. Never once, James.

686
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,037
I'm gonna take us back
along the esplanade.

687
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,517
- Feels like a long shot to me.
- At this point, everything's a long shot.

688
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,919
I can't see anything.
Frost, gimme some light.

689
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:08,350
This is just a little uncool, Luzinski.

690
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,029
Our brouhaha is with Carl,
not with the chick.

691
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,277
I'm just makin' a simple adjustment -
nothing major.

692
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,279
Shake 'em up a little bit.
Now, can I have some light, please?

693
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,873
Thank you.

694
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,560
- Come on, come on. Hurry up.
- Oh, yeah.

695
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:31,558
Now let's find James, and teach
that simple bastard a lesson too.

696
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,470
Hiya, kids. Are we having fun?

697
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,114
- Ted, what's happening?
- Who the hell are you?

698
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,913
Hey, shut up, you!

699
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,031
What the hell is that?

700
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,991
- It's a Taser.
- A what?

701
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,953
A Taser. 65,000 volts of electricity.

702
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,915
It completely incapacitates the victim
without killing him. I got it on sale.

703
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,871
Let's move it. Let's go.

704
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,956
Put your hands up.

705
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,872
Ted, you should do something.

706
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,037
If you come up with any ideas,
please let me know.

707
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,390
We have the right to know
what's going on.

708
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,274
Hey, put a cork in it, sister.
You have no more rights.

709
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,039
And you, buying a goddamn laser gun.

710
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,037
- Taser.
- Whatever.

711
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,073
- You've always gotta be so different.
- I'm in no mood. Just lay off.

712
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,590
- No, you gotta be creative.
- I said lay off.

713
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:35,033
When I say "now", start running.

714
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,550
You're an amazing man.
You know shit about absolutely nothing.

715
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,114
Now I've just heard everything.

716
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,878
Hold it, honey.

717
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,356
You listen to me, you Italian
son of a bitch, and you listen good.

718
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,870
The day you tell me I don't know shit
and I let you get away with it

719
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,834
- is the day that that ocean freezes over.
- That's it. You're over.

720
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,116
Now!

721
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,709
- That's my car!
- Looks pretty undriveable. Come on!

722
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,274
Come on, let's go!

723
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,992
Ted!

724
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,072
- Ted, what the hell's going on?
- I left out a couple of things about myself.

725
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,954
- I'm waiting, you son of a bitch.
- First, my name isn't Ted. It's Carl.

726
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,640
From now on when you yell for me
in a panic, yell Carl.

727
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,318
There's more?

728
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,637
Last night you and Jack Berger
had a fight in your apartment.

729
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,991
How the hell could you
have possibly known that?

730
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,759
Look, Susan, I don't live in your building.

731
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,350
I am a garbageman.
I live across the street from you.

732
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,994
I have been watching you
every day for six weeks.

733
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,476
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.
You have been spying on me?

734
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,717
- I don't really consider it spying.
- What do you consider it?

735
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,877
Let me finish! You and Jack
had a fight, you left angry.

736
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,639
The next morning
I found Berger's body in the trash.

737
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,069
- Jack's body?
- Somebody killed him, Susan.

738
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,714
- For a while I thought it was you.
- Jack is not dead.

739
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:15,594
- Jack was at my apartment last night.
- Trust me, Jack is dead.

740
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,632
Jack came over because
there was some mix-up with a tape

741
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,719
and I went down to my car to get
the right tape and... The tape, the tape.

742
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,628
This is what had Jack so worked up.
We gotta get this to the police.

743
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,116
- What the hell was that for?
- For lying to me. I hate liars!

744
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,353
Hates liars?

745
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,155
That's for spying on me!

746
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,393
Come on!

747
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,998
What happened?

748
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:58,271
It was something.
You got struck by lightning.

749
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,712
- Really?
- A freak storm.

750
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,316
- Police!
- Thank God.

751
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,670
- Police!
- Hello!

752
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,756
Over here, by the playground.

753
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,636
Ew.

754
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,073
Sorry, guys.

755
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,716
Wait! It's not what it looks like.
Please, give us a hand.

756
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,638
No, I'm really not into it, but thanks.

757
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,515
Carl! Come on, Carl. Everything
I ever said about you, just kidding.

758
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,596
He was.

759
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,636
You're not really gonna leave us here,
are you? That would be...

760
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,549
- Come on, come on, already!
- About a thousand keys here.

761
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,076
- Try this one.
- I'm trying.

762
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,274
Hey, hey, hey!

763
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,277
- I got it!
- Look out.

764
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,596
It's my turn, asshole!

765
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,557
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing?

766
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,398
- I'm crashing!
- Down!

767
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,556
I'm back.

768
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,116
Let's go, honey.

769
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,837
Chief, we got 'em. We found 'em.

770
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,318
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Maxwell Potterdam the third.

771
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,876
Maybe you've heard of me. <i>California</i>
magazine just did a piece on me.

772
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,037
With the exception of being
misquoted several times,

773
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,277
I thought it was a pretty good article.

774
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,757
Anyway, all that is... unimportant.

775
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,071
This... is what's important.

776
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,919
Let's put these folks in the car

777
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,589
and go someplace a little more noisy.

778
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,916
Come on, move it.

779
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,632
Hey.

780
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,399
That's them. Getting into that limo.

781
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,833
- What the hell's goin' on?
- I don't know, but we're gonna find out.

782
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,275
I knew this was gonna get heavy.

783
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,193
A lot of good this thing is gonna do us.

784
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:07,999
A pellet gun? You've been holding me
hostage all night with an air rifle?

785
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,509
- Shut up.
- This is too much.

786
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,555
We gotta find a way in there.

787
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,429
I... I got a plan.

788
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,031
That oughta do them.

789
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:30,709
I would love to see
those bastards try and top this.

790
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,039
I would pay a million pesos to see their
faces when they try to stop this baby.

791
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,596
Hey, pal, the next time
we see Carl and James,

792
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,269
it's gonna be Walt
handing them their walking papers.

793
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,838
Somebody's coming.

794
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,836
Come on!

795
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,392
- Come on, move it. Get up there.
- OK, I'm going.

796
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,592
We do live in extraordinary times.

797
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,792
The lengths one has to go
to get the job done.

798
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,356
You're destroying the environment
and you don't even care.

799
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,870
How do you do it?
How do you live with yourself?

800
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,956
Gentlemen.

801
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,309
Although I'd prefer to dump you

802
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,910
along with the rest of this waste
at the bottom of the Pacific,

803
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:52,238
recent disruptions in our operation
have created a problem,

804
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,912
and now the Las Playas landfill
will become your final resting place.

805
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,634
- Buried alive?
- Not to worry.

806
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,878
You'll probably run out of oxygen
before we reach the dump site.

807
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,478
Seal 'em up.

808
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,272
No!

809
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,115
Hold on, everyone!

810
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,755
Hey!

811
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,394
Something's wrong. We're not stopping.

812
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,875
- What?
- We're not stopping!

813
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,428
Aaargh!

814
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:51,238
- What the hell was that?
- Move your ass and find out.

815
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,069
No, you two stay.
I want those barrels sealed. You two.

816
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,988
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

817
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,076
Oh, shit.

818
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,516
Get off of me.

819
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,916
Come on, let's go.

820
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,077
No, no, no. No, no, no.

821
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:51,320
I am not some kind of comic-book
superhero. I'm a pizza man.

822
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,958
- Stay here and keep an eye on him.
- Yeah, right.

823
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,675
I want the trucks moving immediately.

824
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,349
I want every goddamn drop of waste
dumped before the sun rises.

825
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,436
OK, Mr. Potterdam.

826
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,188
Go this way!

827
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,519
Jesus!

828
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,914
Holy shit!

829
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,472
All right,
I'll pick it up on my way back.

830
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,836
- Hi, Carl.
- Hi, James. How are you?

831
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,596
Never better.

832
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,756
Susan! Come on.

833
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,870
Come on! We can't lose 'em!

834
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,757
- We're not gonna make it.
- We'll make it.

835
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,276
South Bay Security. Freeze!

836
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,269
Rent-a-cops. I hate rent-a-cops too.

837
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,357
Carl! What the hell are we doing?

838
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,596
I think I love this girl.

839
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,995
Really? How do you know?

840
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,873
She let me feel the bumps on her head.

841
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,956
Whoa!

842
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,835
- It looks like the bolt broke!
- No shit!

843
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,590
- Hang on.
- OK.

844
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,031
Trees! Trees!

845
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,431
- Carl!
- What?

846
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,199
- How you doin' over there?
- Piece of cake.

847
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,796
You need help.

848
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,075
Carl!

849
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,356
James!

850
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,235
Hey, Carl!

851
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,396
I think I got a problem over here.

852
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,557
All right, let me think of something.

853
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,074
Hey, James, I didn't think of anything yet.

854
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,192
Hey, Carl! I definitely
got a problem over here!

855
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,516
I'm coming.

856
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,956
Mr. Potterdam?

857
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,233
We're lookin' pretty outnumbered here.

858
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,840
I got an idea. Follow me.

859
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,834
- What the hell are you doing?
- Protecting the environment.

860
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,956
- Freeze.
- What are you...

861
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,670
Everybody freeze or I blow his head off!

862
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,472
- He'll do it.
- I'm not kiddin'.

863
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,158
- Don't push him.
- I mean it.

864
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,349
His whole head.

865
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,392
You two with the weapons,
over the side. Do it now!

866
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,390
Yeah, man, I know you.

867
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,991
I know what you're thinking. "We got us
another crazy white boy with a gun."

868
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:16,750
Well, let me tell you, human life means
very little to me at this point in time.

869
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,880
Relax, James, the cops are here.

870
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,516
This is the police.
You all drop those weapons.

871
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:39,398
Yeah. Yeah, you!
You there with the pellet gun,

872
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,149
drop it or I'll blow
your butt away for sure, buddy.

873
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:56,951
A pellet gun? Do you think we'd use
a pellet gun for something like this?

874
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,991
Get 'em!

875
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,511
I gotta find Susan.

876
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,952
Susan!

877
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,512
Susan!

878
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,313
Uh-oh.

879
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,791
Stop 'em before they get away!

880
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,713
Susan! Susan!

881
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,836
Susan!

882
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,115
Help!

883
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,837
Susan.

884
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,195
Ow! Oh!

885
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,155
- Where are we?
- You don't wanna know.

886
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,833
Carl! Carl, over here! Get down!

887
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,478
Come on. Move out.

888
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,516
Move! Everybody in the car.

889
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,276
Get the door open.

890
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,194
- Start the car.
- It won't start.

891
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,157
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

892
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,156
<i> Ouch! Be careful!</i>

893
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,596
High five!

894
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,836
Your car, sir.

895
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,751
Smile, butthead.

896
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,832
Whoa.

897
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,795
Hey, it's not what it looks like.

898
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:03,195
We're respectable peace officers.

899
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,390
It's just all one big, funny mix-up.

900
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,912
No!

901
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,470
Shoo! Shoo!

902
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,999
Get outta here!

903
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,112
<i>Good morning! You're listening</i>
<i>to the Poorman on open-line.</i>

904
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:34,995
<i>We're gonna take our next caller.</i>
<i>Hello! You're on open-line. Go ahead.</i>

905
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,236
<i>Yeah, hi. My name's Stacey.</i>

906
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,670
<i>I have a boyfriend who I've been</i>
<i>going out with for two years now.</i>

907
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,633
<i>He works nights</i>
<i>as a delivery boy for a pizza place.</i>

908
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,830
<i>Last night he never came home</i>

909
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,758
<i>and I am positive he is out</i>
<i>sleeping with another girl.</i>

910
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,634
<i> Well, I think you should</i>
<i>definitely dump the dude!</i>

911
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,310
