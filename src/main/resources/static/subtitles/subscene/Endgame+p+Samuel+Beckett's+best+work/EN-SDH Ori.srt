1
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:29,651
(Man reciting)

2
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,328
(Speaking French)

3
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:23,288
(Speaking French)

4
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:25,665
- Want a hot dog?
- No, thanks.

5
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,585
Just ketchup, please.

6
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,130
Thanks.

7
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,882
Listen, I've got an errand to run.

8
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,468
(Chuckles)

9
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:39,638
Kind of skimpy on the ketchup.

10
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:42,682
Duncan, I've got to do this alone.

11
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,309
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

12
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:47,812
You called me in Paris,
and you said we have to meet.

13
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:51,191
Now suddenly you've
got an errand to run?

14
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:53,526
What's going on?

15
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,528
I don't know.

16
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:57,155
It's...

17
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,450
...nothing.

18
00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,202
You OK?

19
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:06,790
Yeah. I'm OK.

20
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,416
Really.

21
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,836
I know you better
than that, Connor.

22
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:13,922
Haven't seen you like this.

23
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:18,301
People change, Duncan.

24
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:20,595
You'll learn that.

25
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:22,264
Fine.

26
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,557
You can tell me
all about it tonight.

27
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:27,310
8:00 at the bar.

28
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,854
And you're buying.

29
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,564
Right.

30
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,025
8:00, and I'm buying.

31
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:35,485
Mm-hmm.

32
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:40,198
You sure you
gonna be all right, Connor?

33
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:42,826
Of course. Duncan...

34
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,623
...watch your back.

35
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:14,399
(Bell ringing)

36
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,694
Connor?

37
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:21,531
Connor?

38
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:52,562
(Voices on TV)

39
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,116
(Connor on TV) 'OK.'

40
00:06:07,495 --> 00:06:08,661
(Girl on TV) 'What is it, Connor?'

41
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:09,788
(Connor) 'Open it. '

42
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:11,206
(Girl) 'Oh, a ballerina.

43
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,459
'Wow. She's beautiful.

44
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,336
'Thank you. '

45
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:18,213
'Mmm, my angel. '

46
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,340
(Music playing)

47
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,804
(Connor) 'Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you. '

48
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,930
'I love you, Connor. '

49
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,223
'I love you, my Rachel.

50
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:29,766
'Oh, God,
I'm proud of you. '

51
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:30,975
(Rachel) 'Thank you. '

52
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:33,103
(Telephone rings)

53
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:45,865
(Telephone continues ringing)

54
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:59,462
(Telephone continues ringing)

55
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:00,797
(Beeping)

56
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:01,714
Hello?

57
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:02,966
(Beeping)

58
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:11,516
Rachel!

59
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,274
(Connor) 'Rachel.

60
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,443
'My beloved Rachel.

61
00:07:25,614 --> 00:07:28,408
'How long has it been
since she died?

62
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:32,454
'A year?
A century? More?

63
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,456
'My mind keeps slipping,

64
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:37,834
'but some things I know.

65
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,837
'I am Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod,

66
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:45,884
'and once,
a very long time ago,

67
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,386
'I was a Highlander.

68
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,150
'Born of this land,

69
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:05,361
'and like this land, immortal. '

70
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:15,663
(Dogs barking)

71
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:17,207
(Man) Witch!

72
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,168
You brought
this plague on us.

73
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:22,629
You damned us all,
Connor MacLeod.

74
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:24,130
You sold your soul!

75
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,467
(Man) You're a witch!
You child of Satan!

76
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:31,262
They drove you from your home,
cut you off from your own people.

77
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:33,181
What else do they want?

78
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:34,516
Someone to blame.

79
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:36,476
Your mother will burn!

80
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:37,977
Connor.

81
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:41,439
Your mother will burn!
Rot in hell!

82
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:43,316
Get in the house.

83
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:45,860
(Connor) Get off my land!

84
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,570
Leave us in peace!

85
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:49,197
Get off my land!

86
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,162
(Heather) Connor, please.

87
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:58,331
You're not going back to Glenfinnan.

88
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,375
I have no choice.

89
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:02,168
Connor, please.

90
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,587
They can't hurt me,
and they know it,

91
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:07,382
but they can still
hurt the ones I love.

92
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,801
I'm afraid.

93
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,221
I love you, Heather.

94
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:15,223
More than anything in this world.

95
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:17,433
Do you believe me?

96
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,601
Yes.

97
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,395
Then don't be afraid.

98
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:22,814
Nothing can keep me from you.

99
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:28,736
(Horse whinnies)

100
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:29,946
Nothing.

101
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:33,074
(Horse neighs)

102
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:23,875
Connor.

103
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:27,420
I thought you might be
the water horse...

104
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:31,257
come to take me on his back
and drown me in the loch.

105
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,726
No one comes
to take care of you?

106
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,269
(Mother) Not in years.

107
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,271
They think I bedevil
their children

108
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:48,733
because my own was banished.

109
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:52,820
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,405
I'm so sorry.

111
00:10:56,784 --> 00:11:01,496
Tiny mites
and soured dispositions.

112
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:06,959
I've no need of them, Connor,
any of them.

113
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:15,176
Then it's settled.
You're coming with me.

114
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:21,849
(Wind blows)

115
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:22,975
Aah!

116
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:24,560
Connor!

117
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,229
Connor, what is it?

118
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:27,772
I'm not sure.

119
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:29,190
It happened once before.

120
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:30,400
Aah!

121
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,777
Aah! Connor!

122
00:11:37,282 --> 00:11:41,786
(Priest) In the name of the Holy See
and the rule of law...

123
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:42,912
Jacob?

124
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:47,375
...you are hereby charged,
Connor MacLeod, with heresy

125
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,378
and the practise of black magic.

126
00:11:50,504 --> 00:11:53,089
We were friends, remember, Jacob?

127
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,799
I stood at your ordination.

128
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,259
I vouched for you.

129
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,094
You shouldn't have
come back, Connor.

130
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,554
(Priest) Take him.

131
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,014
Aah!

132
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:05,601
(Priest speaking indistinctly)

133
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,404
(Priest) The ties of blood
cannot be severed by word or deed.

134
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:23,619
(Gasps)

135
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,121
(Connor) Mother.

136
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:29,375
(Jacob) Due to the infinite compassion

137
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:34,172
you are entitled
to one final opportunity

138
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:36,132
to renounce all that is unholy,

139
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:40,678
and declare Connor MacLeod
not of your loins.

140
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:44,098
How say you,
Caiolin MacLeod?

141
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:48,853
If your God

142
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:53,065
should persecute me
into the next world,

143
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,943
then I shall simply have
to find myself another.

144
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,153
(Gasps)

145
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,613
(Crowd muttering)

146
00:12:58,739 --> 00:12:59,989
(Woman) Burn her!

147
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,992
No! No! No!

148
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:06,704
(Jacob) He is your son.

149
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,790
I am silent for you.

150
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:14,295
(Connor grunting)

151
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:17,882
(Man) Black powder.

152
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,425
It will ease your suffering.

153
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,306
(Connor) Mother!

154
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:31,187
No!

155
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,316
No!

156
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:41,614
(Grunting)

157
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:50,414
(Caiolin weeping)

158
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:54,335
(Screaming)

159
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:04,554
(Grunts)

160
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,973
(Man) You're next, you demon!

161
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:17,608
Aah!

162
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:20,695
(Growling)

163
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:28,661
(Horse neighs)

164
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:40,548
Aah!

165
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:45,177
My water horse.

166
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,281
Uh!

167
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,786
(Man) The Devil's come back to life!

168
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,923
(Priest) Let her be, Connor.

169
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,550
Aah!

170
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:29,680
Father?

171
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:31,724
(Jacob) Father?

172
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:35,102
Please.

173
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:36,896
Do not leave me.

174
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:39,732
Father.

175
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:52,995
Aah!

176
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,830
(Jacob grunts)

177
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:01,629
Connor...

178
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,465
(Connor) 'My endless days
are filled with memories of the past

179
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,177
'and the death of my mother
by Jacob Kell. '

180
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:12,533
(Engine revs)

181
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,467
(Man) Boy, you people are
extremely difficult to find.

182
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:31,093
We like it that way.

183
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:42,688
Go ahead, man.
Take your pick.

184
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:45,733
Uh!

185
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:55,159
Uh!

186
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:58,954
Aah!

187
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:10,174
(Engine revs)

188
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:33,531
(Gun cocks)

189
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,160
(Fires gun)

190
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,936
Aah.

191
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,861
Take their heads.

192
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:13,487
They might be Immortals.

193
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,114
Yes, they might be.

194
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:32,131
Aah!

195
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:43,976
Don't be long.

196
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:45,603
(Coughs)

197
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:02,995
The Sanctuary.

198
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,831
So it's true.

199
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:18,010
What sacrifices
they have made of you,

200
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:21,847
warehoused like
rotting pieces of meat.

201
00:20:27,312 --> 00:20:31,690
Tell me,
is this the better way?

202
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:36,320
(Kell) I'm sure you've had
time to reflect upon it.

203
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,907
What you need to understand

204
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,785
is that I don't care
about the game.

205
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,371
I don't care about the rules.

206
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:49,583
I don't even care about
these pathetic souls

207
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:54,171
you keep locked away
as a barrier to the prize.

208
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:58,717
Which one is Connor MacLeod?

209
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:11,814
(Whistling)

210
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:24,410
(Grunts)

211
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:30,958
(Strained breathing)

212
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:04,158
Well, what do we do now?

213
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:06,618
What we always do.

214
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,746
We're Watchers, not cops.

215
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:11,040
(Man) We'll find another volunteer.

216
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:16,462
(Bell tolling)

217
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:24,136
(Telephone rings)

218
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:33,103
(Telephone continues ringing)

219
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:47,743
(Ring continues)

220
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:59,588
(Woman) 'Whatever you fear
about Connor MacLeod,

221
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,340
'fear the worst. '

222
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:04,551
Who is this?

223
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:06,053
A friend.

224
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:09,431
'Don't bother looking for me, Duncan. '

225
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:13,852
(Dial tone)

226
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:21,985
He's on the move.

227
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:34,790
Duncan MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

228
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,251
Hello, Methos.

229
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:40,838
What brings you
to my humble abode?

230
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:42,214
Need your help.

231
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:44,425
Why me?

232
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:46,385
(Duncan) You've been around
for 5,000 years.

233
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:51,098
I want the benefit of your experience.

234
00:23:51,224 --> 00:23:54,351
And I thought it was a social call.

235
00:23:55,854 --> 00:23:57,563
You ever had nightmares?

236
00:23:58,106 --> 00:23:59,356
What kind of nightmares?

237
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,984
Bloody images

238
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,236
powerful enough to even
break your meditation.

239
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:08,449
We live violent lives, MacLeod.

240
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:10,159
Some of that's
bound to stay with us.

241
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,788
These ones came 10 years to the day
that Connor MacLeod disappeared.

242
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:18,125
Connor had good reason to go.

243
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:20,502
He told me how much
Rachel meant to him.

244
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:24,047
There was more to it than that.
I was with him that day.

245
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:26,008
The day Rachel was killed?

246
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:28,135
Something wasn't right.

247
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,761
'Connor, you OK?'

248
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:33,765
'Yeah. I'm OK.
Really. '

249
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:36,310
'I know you better
than that, Connor.

250
00:24:36,436 --> 00:24:39,688
'I've never seen you like this. '

251
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:42,774
'People change, Duncan.

252
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:44,485
'You'll learn that. '

253
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:48,697
I need to know
if he's still alive, Methos.

254
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:52,409
You know a little
about Buddhist monks.

255
00:24:52,535 --> 00:24:54,578
Some of them come
to cherish life so much

256
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:58,707
that to step on an insect
or harm a blade of grass

257
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,709
becomes a violation
of their creed,

258
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:05,088
so they place themselves under
an extreme form of protective custody...

259
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,341
A Sanctuary of sorts.

260
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:11,428
Well, for an Immortal
who comes to abhor the bloodshed,

261
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:13,305
there's a similar solution...

262
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,891
A way to be removed
from the game forever.

263
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:18,560
The price is unimaginably high,

264
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:24,608
but you are, for all practical purposes,
protected from the violence within you.

265
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:26,818
And it's called The Sanctuary.

266
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:28,779
Connor would never do that.

267
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:32,157
Are you sure? It's been around
since before you were born.

268
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:34,451
At least until last night.

269
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:36,286
What happened last night?

270
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:39,164
It was annihilated.

271
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:57,933
(Connor) 'Hey, Duncan,
what's the matter?'

272
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,269
(Duncan) 'The British
destroyed the clans, Connor.

273
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:02,354
'Scotland's finished. '

274
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,190
(Connor) 'Scotland will always
be Scotland,'

275
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:07,192
and someday you'll go back.

276
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:08,819
You can bet on it.

277
00:26:08,945 --> 00:26:11,071
- How much?
- Aw, come on.

278
00:26:11,197 --> 00:26:13,865
Does everything have
to be a wager with you?

279
00:26:13,992 --> 00:26:15,867
Well, you're the one
that keeps telling me

280
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:18,161
our lives are nothing
but a boundless game.

281
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:20,122
(Chuckles)

282
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:22,499
(Duncan) Good morning, gentlemen.

283
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,167
What seems to be
the problem here?

284
00:26:24,294 --> 00:26:26,962
(Man) They refuses to pay her toll, sir.

285
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,922
(Duncan) Really? How dare they?

286
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,299
These men are rogues.

287
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:32,676
(Faith) These men are
liars and scoundrels, sir.

288
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:35,637
They've done nothing but prey upon us
three years running,

289
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:37,681
right at this very spot.

290
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:40,100
And by whose authority
do you act?

291
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:42,394
By Deed of the King.

292
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:46,315
(Connor)
There is a little 'X' down here.

293
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:49,443
Does the King always
sign his name with an 'X'?

294
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:50,944
Excuse me. Sorry.

295
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,571
I think these gentlemen
should be paid.

296
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:54,156
That deed is a fake.

297
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:55,532
That's a matter of opinion.

298
00:26:55,658 --> 00:26:57,701
You, sir,
are no better than they.

299
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,203
That is also a matter of opinion.

300
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,872
Here you go.

301
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,499
Ladies.

302
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:06,376
It's gold!

303
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:08,587
Why not... It's gold.

304
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:09,838
(First man laughs)

305
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,340
Hey, wait a minute.
They took my money!

306
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:12,799
Oh, it's here.

307
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:14,343
They took my money!

308
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:15,677
(Man) Let's go get 'em!

309
00:27:16,262 --> 00:27:17,262
Shall we?

310
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:18,597
(Yelling)

311
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:19,931
Aye.

312
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:23,268
(Man) Ah!

313
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:27,481
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

314
00:27:36,574 --> 00:27:37,658
Heh heh.

315
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:39,951
(Connor) Not bad.
Uh-oh.

316
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:42,788
Mmm.

317
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,500
All right boys, time to go.
Let's go!

318
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,877
Come on!

319
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,880
(Duncan) Oh. Cuckoo.

320
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:54,549
Oh, looks heavy, huh?

321
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:56,093
(Duncan) Looks like
you lost your edge, lad.

322
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:57,302
(Connor) Really heavy.

323
00:27:57,428 --> 00:27:59,763
- Or could he be lass?
- Could be.

324
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:01,556
Could be.

325
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:03,266
(Groaning)

326
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,435
Hyah!

327
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:08,355
(Driver) Come on!

328
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:10,649
Hyah! Hyah!

329
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,069
Hyah!

330
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,806
(Bombs exploding)

331
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:07,849
(Duncan) 'Corporal Duncan MacLeod,
sir.

332
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:11,311
'I've come to pick up
the wounded. '

333
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:41,883
(Indistinct chatter)

334
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:49,933
You've improved greatly.

335
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:52,143
Ah, you really think so?

336
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:58,358
No.

337
00:30:58,484 --> 00:30:59,943
I'm just being gracious.

338
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:01,653
Hmm.

339
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,489
Now, remember.

340
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:08,869
You are only immortal as long
as you can keep your head

341
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:10,245
on your shoulders.

342
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,250
Argh!

343
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:20,630
Duncan, what you give up
to your adversary in defeat...

344
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:21,840
...is everything.

345
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:26,970
I know. And at that point,
I'm very, very dead. Come on!

346
00:31:27,096 --> 00:31:30,599
Not just dead, Duncan.
Empty!

347
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:35,562
Aye, Connor, I know.
It's called the Quickening.

348
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:37,814
Our strength and knowledge,
our life essence,

349
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,067
flows into the victor, feeds him,
and makes him stronger, yes?

350
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:44,321
It's what drives the other Immortals
to kill us,

351
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:47,616
and what forces us to be smarter,
better than the rest.

352
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:49,826
(Groans) I understand.

353
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,162
Oh.

354
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:56,750
You do?

355
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:58,793
Oh.

356
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,420
(Connor) Good.

357
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,256
(Groans) I slipped.

358
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,675
Listen, soon you
and I will have to part.

359
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:09,971
There is one more thing
I want to give to you.

360
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:12,515
(Grunts)

361
00:32:12,642 --> 00:32:13,808
Va via. Va via!

362
00:32:13,935 --> 00:32:16,269
(Laughing) Oh, aye!

363
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:19,481
Oh, aye.
This is much more to my liking.

364
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:20,982
Good.

365
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,609
Bah!

366
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:25,779
Attack me.

367
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:28,907
But you've got your back to me.

368
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:32,953
It's not always
about strength, Duncan.

369
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,454
Attack me!

370
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:42,170
Aah!

371
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:44,923
It's about manipulation of the mind...

372
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:50,303
...as well as the body.

373
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:53,139
Aye, but now I'm in control.

374
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:55,475
Are you?

375
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,814
(Grunts)

376
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:05,902
Remember well, my friend.

377
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:09,406
Properly executed,
this move is unstoppable.

378
00:33:10,992 --> 00:33:14,077
Properly executed,
we'll now have this talk again.

379
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,843
(Wind blows)

380
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,310
Who are you?

381
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:42,105
A friend or a lover.

382
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,190
Or a wife.

383
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:46,359
- Kate?
- Atta boy.

384
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:49,320
Except I'm Faith now.

385
00:33:50,406 --> 00:33:52,866
Part of the makeover.

386
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:54,242
What are you doing here?

387
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,120
Remember our wedding day,
Duncan?

388
00:33:58,122 --> 00:34:00,123
I do.

389
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,834
(Sighs) The way we danced.

390
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,294
(Scottish music playing)

391
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,171
I felt like we were flying.

392
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,600
Of course, we did come down,
didn't we?

393
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,480
Crashing.

394
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:27,442
(Motorcycle engines revving)

395
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:28,777
Oh, shit.

396
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:43,583
(Man) It's time to show
our Immortal brother a thing or two.

397
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:55,428
Somebody order a club sandwich?

398
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,931
He's funny.
Nice outfit, too.

399
00:34:58,057 --> 00:35:00,767
Faith, I told you
I look like a fuckin' orange!

400
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:03,353
I'm not dressing you black, Bob.
Trust me.

401
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,480
- Who are they?
- Friends.

402
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,025
What, it's a team sport now?

403
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:10,443
What, you didn't know?

404
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:12,195
It's a whole new ball game.

405
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:15,657
Aah!

406
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:35,802
Hey!

407
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,304
Nice bat.

408
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,401
Argh!

409
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:52,777
Told you I was gonna cut you.

410
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,081
(Growling)

411
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:13,423
Let my man Jin Ke
deal with him.

412
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:18,219
Jin Ke...

413
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,096
...who served
with the Emperor Chin.

414
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,432
The same man.

415
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,517
Some people say
you're a man of honour.

416
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,603
What do you know about honour?

417
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,023
Oh, great.

418
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:32,650
Yah!

419
00:37:16,862 --> 00:37:19,405
Honour's not in a weapon.

420
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:20,865
It's in the man.

421
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:50,603
(Kell) Enough!

422
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:56,401
Boys, boys.

423
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:59,153
(Kell) I do apologise.

424
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,698
When it comes to discipline,

425
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:05,743
the first hundred years
are the hardest.

426
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:10,248
Oh!

427
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:13,501
Oh!

428
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,754
Guess I'm not much
of a swords guy.

429
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,384
I thought I told you to stop.

430
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:25,555
Yeah, well, I stopped.

431
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:26,723
Tell me, Carlos.

432
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:29,267
How much is your life worth?

433
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,811
Don't start this bullshit, man.

434
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,564
(Kell) 'Cause the only way
to win your freedom

435
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,316
is to kill me.

436
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:38,985
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

437
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:40,570
Then go ahead.

438
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:43,531
Stop the madness.

439
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,199
(Tyres squealing)

440
00:38:45,326 --> 00:38:48,494
Can you live with the fear?

441
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,414
Can you live
with the weakness?

442
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:56,210
(Saw buzzes)

443
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:58,004
Weakness, Carlos.

444
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,427
I call this

445
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:07,138
decap with a twist...

446
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,598
No sugar.

447
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:53,768
(Gasping)

448
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,189
- Watchers?
- Huh?

449
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,860
Watchers observe Immortals.

450
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:04,862
They're not supposed to interfere.

451
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,657
Unfortunately, our role
has changed somewhat.

452
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,200
Why?

453
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:11,035
Because the rules have been broken.

454
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:15,415
One of your kind has gone renegade.

455
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,461
In doing so, he's gained
himself a sizable advantage.

456
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,922
One that'll be
impossible to overcome.

457
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:24,507
Nobody's unbeatable.

458
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:27,635
Oh, yes, Duncan.
He is.

459
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,432
Unbeatable.

460
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,438
No.

461
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,649
(Grunting)

462
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:48,489
Ah.

463
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:49,699
(Grunts)

464
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:52,243
Sorry about that.

465
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,954
There must always
be two of your kind.

466
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,416
As long as there are two,
and you're kept from fighting,

467
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,418
then the prize is safe.

468
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,171
The Sanctuary must not fail again.

469
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,630
You're insane.

470
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:07,133
(Duncan) Get yourself another volunteer.

471
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:11,262
We had a number of volunteers!

472
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:14,807
Sadly, that's no longer the case.

473
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:17,518
You'll be warehoused, hidden away.

474
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,145
Go to hell.

475
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,439
Don't worry.

476
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:24,567
(Distorted) The drugs
will kick in momentarily.

477
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:33,784
(Heavy breathing)

478
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:39,540
(Woman screaming)

479
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,171
(Gasps)

480
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:49,884
(Horse neighing)

481
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,886
(Swords clanging)

482
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:55,181
(Gasps)

483
00:42:02,898 --> 00:42:04,732
(Connor) Get up.

484
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,735
Get up!

485
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:17,537
You have better things to do
than lie there on your ass.

486
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,289
Who are you?

487
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:24,460
Someone who knows more about you
than you know about yourself.

488
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,462
Are you a demon?

489
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:31,092
(Laughing) I've been called that
and worse.

490
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:34,762
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

491
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:36,597
Connor MacLeod?

492
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:41,936
And like you, my friend,
I have a hard time dying.

493
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,406
(Metal tools rattling)

494
00:42:58,203 --> 00:42:59,245
Dawson?

495
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:01,998
You look like shit.

496
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:03,207
Thanks.

497
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:04,875
How long have I...

498
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:06,711
We'll talk about it later.
We gotta get outta here.

499
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:09,380
Come on, can you walk?

500
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:10,798
Yeah.

501
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,133
Uh.

502
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:31,736
(Duncan) Go. Go!
What are you doing here?

503
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,321
(Methos) Keeping tabs on you.

504
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:35,072
(Duncan) Yeah?

505
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:39,327
Well, someone should keep tabs
on that psychotic asshole back there.

506
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:40,995
Didn't you get it back in London?

507
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:43,372
(Methos)
These guys don't play by the rules.

508
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:45,166
You don't know what
you're up against, Mac.

509
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:46,542
So people keep telling me.

510
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:48,002
Stop the car.

511
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,421
I managed to liberate
that from their lost and found.

512
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:52,340
There's blood on it.

513
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,342
I didn't say it was easy.

514
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,303
- Pull over.
- (Methos) What?

515
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:58,804
Pull over.

516
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:01,557
(Dawson) MacLeod, tell me something.

517
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:02,683
Mac, hear him out!

518
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,269
Mac! Will you tell me something?

519
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:07,980
Now, how many Quickenings
have you had?

520
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,901
How many heads have you taken?

521
00:44:12,027 --> 00:44:14,528
I don't keep score.

522
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:16,238
Well, we do.

523
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:25,998
(Computer) 'MacLeod, Connor. '

524
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:27,458
What's that?

525
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:29,168
The Watchers' version of a résumé.

526
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:32,713
'262 confirmed Immortal kills. '

527
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,717
It's a bit like handicapping horses,
but it's part of the gig, all right?

528
00:44:36,843 --> 00:44:38,844
'MacLeod, Duncan.

529
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:42,473
'174 confirmed Immortal kills.

530
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,559
'174 confirmed Immortal kills. '

531
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,353
Sound about right?

532
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:49,647
So, what's your point?

533
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:52,358
(Sighs) Here's the gentleman
you met in Connor's loft.

534
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:59,699
'Kell, Jacob.
661 confirmed Immortal kills.

535
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:03,619
'661 confirmed Immortal kills. '

536
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,205
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

537
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,541
Sanctuary wasn't shit, pal.

538
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:11,252
This guy is way out of your league.

539
00:45:17,008 --> 00:45:19,593
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.

540
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,137
Why?

541
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:23,806
Something doesn't make sense.

542
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,850
What are you saying?

543
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:29,353
I think he's saying
he wants to see the body.

544
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,021
Well, it's gonna be a rough I.D.

545
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:33,649
They're all missing their heads!

546
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:48,205
(♪ Harmonica)

547
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:16,275
We gave 'em
a Christian burial, MacLeod.

548
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:19,361
It was decent, you know.
Said all the right words.

549
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:21,947
Can't begin to tell you
how reassuring that is.

550
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:24,158
(Dawson) With all these
unexplained corpses,

551
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:27,411
well, we had to take it
off the beaten track.

552
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:29,371
End of the road, Joe.

553
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,583
Thanks.

554
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:37,213
You watch your ass, MacLeod.

555
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,799
It's not my ass
I'm worried about.

556
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:45,846
Did I happen to mention
about all this coming to a bad end?

557
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:49,850
No, Methos.
I don't believe you did.

558
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,149
You were gonna stay and dig.

559
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:59,902
Dig? Oh, yeah!

560
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:01,904
(Car door closes)

561
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:20,381
(Thunder)

562
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:28,430
(Duncan) 'I need to know
if he's still alive, Professor.

563
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:31,600
'I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body. '

564
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:36,313
(Methos) 'One of your kind
has gone renegade. '

565
00:47:41,278 --> 00:47:43,863
(Connor) 'People change, Duncan.

566
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,823
'You'll learn that. '

567
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,704
(Wind blows)

568
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:07,094
(Connor speaking native language)

569
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:13,851
No.

570
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,235
What are you doing here?

571
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:27,406
You walked out
on your life, Connor.

572
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:28,574
Why?

573
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,329
I had my reasons.

574
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:35,039
Reasons?

575
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:40,628
Every life I touch ends...

576
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:45,049
...brutally and for no reason.

577
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:49,178
It's a curse that's followed me
for centuries.

578
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:50,721
(Chuckles)

579
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:54,600
I can't outrun it,
and I can't outlive it.

580
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:59,021
Rachel's death made you
the last soul on this planet

581
00:48:59,147 --> 00:49:00,481
that means a damn to me.

582
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:03,317
I thought there was a way out.

583
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:04,485
The Sanctuary?

584
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:07,279
Yes.

585
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:11,533
The Sanctuary.

586
00:49:12,744 --> 00:49:13,994
So, how did you escape?

587
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,289
I didn't escape.

588
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,459
I was let go.

589
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,298
I couldn't see the slaughter...

590
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:28,384
...only heard it...

591
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:30,761
...and felt it.

592
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,807
(Wind blows)

593
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:00,207
(People yell)

594
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:04,878
Jacob Kell.

595
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:17,891
So, here we are.

596
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:20,144
Both Immortal.

597
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:24,690
Missed the signs,
didn't we?

598
00:50:24,816 --> 00:50:28,360
But we were both
so new at the game.

599
00:50:28,486 --> 00:50:30,487
(Thunder)

600
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:32,781
(Duncan) Connor.

601
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:37,327
What a glorious sight.

602
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,498
Just look, Connor.

603
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:46,670
Look back at the endless
travesties of your life,

604
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:50,966
and you'll see me, always there
waiting in the shadows.

605
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:54,553
When friends and lovers
are wiped from your sight...

606
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:56,680
...I'm there.

607
00:50:57,432 --> 00:51:01,602
When those you cherish
die abruptly and for no reason

608
00:51:01,728 --> 00:51:03,729
I'm there for you.

609
00:51:04,856 --> 00:51:08,901
And when your cellmates
in their so-called Sanctuary

610
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:12,154
are left twitching
like headless chickens...

611
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:14,615
Guess who?

612
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:20,788
(Duncan) Connor.

613
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:23,207
(Connor) Stay out of it, Duncan.

614
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:31,340
Would you kill
an unarmed man again, Connor?

615
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:33,550
Oh!

616
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:36,428
You didn't know, Duncan?

617
00:51:38,306 --> 00:51:40,349
Because you didn't tell him.

618
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:44,978
Would that finally put the agony
in your soul to rest?

619
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:47,815
Then go ahead.

620
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:51,693
Send me home.

621
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,278
What's stopping you?

622
00:51:53,905 --> 00:51:55,405
Honour?

623
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:57,616
Guilt?

624
00:51:57,742 --> 00:52:01,411
The nagging sense that maybe you,
more than I, deserve to die?

625
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:04,581
Or somewhere along the way

626
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:07,626
did you just lose your nerve?

627
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:09,711
It's holy ground, Connor.

628
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:11,713
Hmm.

629
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,382
Yes.

630
00:52:13,508 --> 00:52:16,260
Take your shot.

631
00:52:17,303 --> 00:52:18,887
What better chance than now?

632
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:21,098
Do it.

633
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:25,310
Do it for your sweet mother.

634
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:27,396
'Aah!'

635
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,316
Or the sweet little war orphan

636
00:52:31,442 --> 00:52:34,403
Rachel Ellenstein...

637
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:39,783
...who, if I'm not mistaken,

638
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:42,494
you raised
as your own daughter.

639
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,705
Tell me, do they even begin

640
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:47,166
to equal for the murder
of a man of God

641
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,418
who raised me as his own son?

642
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:51,795
'Aah!'

643
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:54,923
Slow...

644
00:52:55,049 --> 00:52:56,800
...close...

645
00:52:57,677 --> 00:52:59,845
Feels good, doesn't it?

646
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:02,431
But look at you.

647
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:06,185
Even now, you're afraid,

648
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:08,061
afraid you'll lose.

649
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:10,063
That's your true fear, isn't it?

650
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,733
The thought of giving up
your essence to me,

651
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:16,570
making me
even stronger by it.

652
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:20,282
What's wrong?

653
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:23,911
Don't you want
to be inside me?

654
00:53:50,104 --> 00:53:53,148
I want you to think back
to this moment, Connor!

655
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,573
In the endless nights ahead!

656
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:03,200
(Connor) Aah!

657
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:18,215
And know...

658
00:54:18,716 --> 00:54:21,718
...that every time
you close your eyes

659
00:54:21,844 --> 00:54:26,306
from now to eternity,
I'll be there!

660
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:31,520
Ripping apart the ones
you care about most!

661
00:54:31,646 --> 00:54:33,021
Aah!

662
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:45,450
It's never over,
Connor MacLeod.

663
00:54:45,576 --> 00:54:48,328
Living is what matters.

664
00:54:48,454 --> 00:54:52,541
And you will live with this.
Count on it.

665
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:56,920
One far-off day, you and I
will be the only two remaining.

666
00:54:57,046 --> 00:54:58,880
You will look back on this

667
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:02,676
and know you had
one chance to stop me.

668
00:55:02,802 --> 00:55:03,969
You failed.

669
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:05,971
But until that day,

670
00:55:06,097 --> 00:55:08,890
I will take my vengeance
on those you love.

671
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:14,396
Your living has been my prize.

672
00:55:15,273 --> 00:55:16,773
For old times' sake.

673
00:55:18,609 --> 00:55:20,527
(Jacob) 'He is your son. '

674
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:25,866
You, on the other hand...

675
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:33,582
...are on borrowed time.

676
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:34,958
Call you.

677
00:55:40,506 --> 00:55:42,257
Is what he said true?

678
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:47,137
Is it?

679
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:52,476
Believe only what your heart
and conscience tell you.

680
00:55:53,394 --> 00:55:57,272
Connor, with time,
anything can be forgiven.

681
00:55:57,398 --> 00:55:59,232
You taught me that.

682
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:06,073
Did I?

683
00:56:21,672 --> 00:56:24,591
(Clapping, laughing,
music playing)

684
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:37,020
Oh, look at Dave. Dave!

685
00:56:37,146 --> 00:56:38,563
(Kate) Behave yourself, Duncan!

686
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:40,482
(Man) No more talking!

687
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:44,486
May all your hardships fade away.

688
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:46,822
(Man) Till night becomes morn,

689
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:50,075
let love remain
to guide your way.

690
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:52,035
Till the day we are reborn.

691
00:56:53,538 --> 00:56:55,163
Till the day we are reborn.

692
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:56,581
Kiss her, won't you?

693
00:56:56,707 --> 00:56:59,126
(Cheering and clapping)

694
00:57:05,508 --> 00:57:06,591
(Duncan) Connor?

695
00:57:10,346 --> 00:57:11,972
(Laughing)
I thought you'd never get here.

696
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:13,598
Connor!

697
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,355
(Connor) You know
Kate is like us, Immortal.

698
00:57:20,481 --> 00:57:22,816
Aye. I sensed something
the day we met,

699
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:24,359
but I wasn't sure.

700
00:57:24,485 --> 00:57:26,319
Well, now you know.

701
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:32,909
And you know as well as I do
that her immortality

702
00:57:33,035 --> 00:57:36,455
can only be triggered
by the shock of a violent death.

703
00:57:37,373 --> 00:57:39,332
Yes, I do.

704
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:41,960
And without such a death,
she will simply grow old and die.

705
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:43,795
Yes, I know, Connor.

706
00:57:43,921 --> 00:57:46,298
Is that what you came
to tell me on my wedding day?

707
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:48,967
Come on.
Drink up, man.

708
00:57:49,093 --> 00:57:51,845
(Sets down mug) No.

709
00:57:52,513 --> 00:57:53,763
I was wondering.

710
00:57:56,434 --> 00:57:58,310
Does she know?

711
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:01,396
Why?

712
00:58:07,945 --> 00:58:10,780
Many years
after I was married...

713
00:58:12,366 --> 00:58:13,867
...one night...

714
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:18,413
...I found Heather
in front of the house.

715
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:22,250
She had a knife in one hand
and her hair in the other.

716
00:58:22,376 --> 00:58:25,962
When I asked her why she
had done such a thing to herself,

717
00:58:26,088 --> 00:58:28,590
she said it was
the one part of her

718
00:58:28,716 --> 00:58:30,759
that would never age.

719
00:58:30,885 --> 00:58:32,719
It would forever
remain the same

720
00:58:32,845 --> 00:58:35,805
as when I first
fell in love with her.

721
00:58:37,016 --> 00:58:39,726
That's how she wanted me
to remember her.

722
00:58:40,478 --> 00:58:42,521
Why are you telling me this?

723
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:46,858
Because I once loved a woman
more than life itself...

724
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:52,739
...and I watched her die.

725
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:57,536
Unlike me, you have a choice.

726
00:59:14,011 --> 00:59:16,263
What would you have me tell her?

727
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:19,766
I'd tell her nothing.
She wouldn't believe you anyway.

728
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:21,309
Then I can do nothing.

729
00:59:21,435 --> 00:59:24,604
She's in the flower of her youth.

730
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,440
Enjoy the moment,
and let it pass.

731
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:28,984
And if it were you in my place?

732
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,986
I was in your place!

733
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:35,615
But I thank God
I never had the choice.

734
00:59:35,741 --> 00:59:37,867
I love Kate,

735
00:59:37,994 --> 00:59:40,996
and I will hold on to her
as long as I can.

736
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:43,123
And that is all I can do!

737
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:50,130
(Duncan) 'Forever, my love. '

738
00:59:51,549 --> 00:59:53,300
'Until the day we are reborn. '

739
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,344
'Until the day we are reborn. '

740
01:00:42,224 --> 01:00:44,309
(Wind blows)

741
01:00:52,693 --> 01:00:55,862
- You haven't lost your touch.
- What do you want?

742
01:00:55,988 --> 01:00:58,073
- To talk.
- Oh, that's a first.

743
01:00:58,199 --> 01:00:59,991
I've tried to talk to you
a thousand times...

744
01:01:00,117 --> 01:01:01,451
Get to the point.

745
01:01:01,577 --> 01:01:04,162
- I was wrong.
- Oh, no, no.

746
01:01:04,288 --> 01:01:05,789
Stealing is wrong.

747
01:01:05,915 --> 01:01:07,916
Lying is wrong.
Killing's wrong.

748
01:01:08,042 --> 01:01:09,959
What you did
goes well beyond wrong.

749
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:13,088
Fine. I deserve that,

750
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:14,798
but I want a chance
to make it right.

751
01:01:14,924 --> 01:01:16,800
You want to make it right?

752
01:01:16,926 --> 01:01:19,803
Then give me back the ability
to have children,

753
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:22,180
to grow old
with the man I love.

754
01:01:22,306 --> 01:01:24,557
How about anything that
resembles a normal life?

755
01:01:24,684 --> 01:01:26,851
And you took it all
away from me.

756
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:28,728
Those things I can't give you.

757
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:31,272
Oh, something else
you forgot to tell me.

758
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:33,733
Goodbye, Duncan.

759
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:38,530
Kell can't give you those things, either,
so tell me, Kate, why him?

760
01:01:39,615 --> 01:01:43,660
Because I've never known anybody
with such a capacity for hate

761
01:01:43,786 --> 01:01:45,120
except me.

762
01:01:45,246 --> 01:01:48,415
That's what's kept you
going all these years?

763
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:50,041
Hmm?

764
01:01:52,086 --> 01:01:53,586
Fine.

765
01:01:55,256 --> 01:01:56,589
Go home, Faith.

766
01:01:58,384 --> 01:02:00,927
Take care of what's important.

767
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,961
(Wind blows)

768
01:03:06,827 --> 01:03:09,662
(Thunderclap)

769
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:26,095
You were with him.

770
01:03:28,516 --> 01:03:30,809
A woman is a temple

771
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:33,603
built on a sewer.

772
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:36,689
(Thunder rumbling)

773
01:03:36,816 --> 01:03:40,276
Remember what you were
when I first found you.

774
01:03:42,029 --> 01:03:44,030
A whore.

775
01:03:45,783 --> 01:03:47,784
Now, look at you.

776
01:03:48,786 --> 01:03:50,912
A liberated whore.

777
01:03:51,038 --> 01:03:52,372
Fuck you.

778
01:03:52,498 --> 01:03:56,084
Oh, we'll get to that, blossom.

779
01:03:56,210 --> 01:04:01,923
But in the interim, be grateful
I don't take your pretty little face off.

780
01:04:03,092 --> 01:04:05,760
Hurts, doesn't it...

781
01:04:07,137 --> 01:04:10,265
...that there is something
you actually can't have?

782
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:17,021
Hmm. I can have
anything I want.

783
01:04:18,691 --> 01:04:20,608
Except me.

784
01:04:21,318 --> 01:04:23,152
(Sighs)

785
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:26,781
I've already had you.

786
01:04:29,076 --> 01:04:31,744
(Thunder crashing)

787
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:33,538
(Softly) Not really.

788
01:04:37,918 --> 01:04:39,919
Close enough.

789
01:05:04,862 --> 01:05:07,280
(Door opening)

790
01:05:28,886 --> 01:05:33,431
(Woman vocalizing)

791
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:42,482
(♪ Woman singing)

792
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,934
Forever.

793
01:07:35,137 --> 01:07:37,889
May love remain
to guide our way

794
01:07:38,015 --> 01:07:39,766
till the day we are reborn.

795
01:07:45,064 --> 01:07:47,023
Forgive me.

796
01:07:48,984 --> 01:07:51,486
(Screams)

797
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,501
I'm sorry.

798
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:10,254
You had no right.

799
01:08:27,731 --> 01:08:28,731
(Wind blows)

800
01:08:28,857 --> 01:08:29,857
(Gasps)

801
01:08:29,983 --> 01:08:31,818
(Thunder)

802
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:34,779
(Duncan) Kate?

803
01:08:34,905 --> 01:08:37,698
No. Don't be frightened.
You're Immortal, we both are.

804
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:39,826
Aah!

805
01:08:42,246 --> 01:08:44,080
I did it for you...

806
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:46,290
...for us.

807
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:48,793
- Aah!
- Kate.

808
01:08:48,919 --> 01:08:52,797
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God! What have I done?

809
01:08:52,923 --> 01:08:54,423
Kate!

810
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:56,801
(Faith) 'You wanted this. '

811
01:08:56,927 --> 01:08:59,554
You forced it on me.

812
01:09:00,347 --> 01:09:02,265
I never asked for eternity.

813
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:03,891
(Crying)

814
01:09:04,017 --> 01:09:06,894
(Duncan) 'I never wanted us to be apart. '

815
01:09:11,066 --> 01:09:13,734
- Would you have really understood?
- Which part?

816
01:09:13,861 --> 01:09:17,280
The endless, numbing
sameness of it all?

817
01:09:17,406 --> 01:09:19,615
Or never bothering
to love someone

818
01:09:20,534 --> 01:09:24,328
because whole lifetimes tick by so fast
they don't even count any more?

819
01:09:24,454 --> 01:09:26,581
(Opens door)

820
01:09:27,082 --> 01:09:28,499
Then why did you come?

821
01:09:30,043 --> 01:09:32,712
To see if I could feel again...

822
01:09:33,547 --> 01:09:35,214
...anything.

823
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:37,800
(Door closes)

824
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:49,562
(Elevator bell dings)

825
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:55,651
You're missing the point, Kate.

826
01:09:55,777 --> 01:09:58,112
The difference
between Connor and I

827
01:09:58,238 --> 01:09:59,906
is that as long
as you're still alive,

828
01:10:00,032 --> 01:10:02,533
there's a chance that one day
I might be forgiven.

829
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:04,619
It may take years...

830
01:10:05,954 --> 01:10:07,705
...centuries, even.

831
01:10:08,832 --> 01:10:10,791
But at least I can carry
that hope inside me.

832
01:10:11,793 --> 01:10:14,212
That's one blessing
of immortality...

833
01:10:16,256 --> 01:10:18,257
...there's always tomorrow.

834
01:10:19,885 --> 01:10:21,135
Even for us.

835
01:10:27,851 --> 01:10:29,769
(Bell tolling)

836
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:42,114
What are you doing, Jin?

837
01:10:43,075 --> 01:10:44,450
Just thinking.

838
01:10:46,036 --> 01:10:49,372
(Jin) Men, for the most part,
can mend their ways

839
01:10:49,498 --> 01:10:52,208
only after they have made
a mistake.

840
01:10:54,127 --> 01:10:55,461
One day soon,

841
01:10:56,505 --> 01:11:01,842
we will all serve very little purpose
to Kell, except dead.

842
01:11:17,526 --> 01:11:18,901
(Kell) A toast.

843
01:11:21,196 --> 01:11:23,197
I see tonight...

844
01:11:24,366 --> 01:11:27,201
...as a celebration of the spirit.

845
01:11:28,704 --> 01:11:30,496
To all of you

846
01:11:30,622 --> 01:11:34,917
who continue to stand by me
even those who might waver

847
01:11:35,043 --> 01:11:36,877
at times...

848
01:11:38,171 --> 01:11:41,549
You are my flock.

849
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:43,884
You

850
01:11:44,469 --> 01:11:46,512
nourish my soul.

851
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:54,270
You are all a part
of a great journey,

852
01:11:54,771 --> 01:11:57,606
a 400-year quest...

853
01:11:59,318 --> 01:12:01,152
...for justice.

854
01:12:03,155 --> 01:12:06,615
(Kell) And here, my friends,

855
01:12:06,742 --> 01:12:10,286
is the instrument of that justice.

856
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:15,499
The giver and taker
of creation...

857
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,713
...baptised in blood.

858
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:28,346
It is the living
that matters after all.

859
01:12:33,268 --> 01:12:35,436
It sings like an angel.

860
01:12:36,897 --> 01:12:38,522
Just listen.

861
01:12:41,276 --> 01:12:42,860
(Faith gasps)

862
01:12:47,115 --> 01:12:47,990
(Jin) Uh!

863
01:12:54,873 --> 01:12:56,165
(Man) Uh!

864
01:13:04,299 --> 01:13:05,800
(Carlos) Uh!

865
01:13:05,926 --> 01:13:07,343
(Gasps)

866
01:13:19,106 --> 01:13:21,107
Till the day we are reborn.

867
01:13:22,317 --> 01:13:23,651
(Faith gasps)

868
01:13:32,577 --> 01:13:33,828
Uh!

869
01:13:41,795 --> 01:13:43,129
Aah!

870
01:13:44,548 --> 01:13:46,465
Aah!

871
01:14:02,649 --> 01:14:04,900
(Wind blows)

872
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:19,582
Kell.

873
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:22,251
Jacob Kell.

874
01:14:31,094 --> 01:14:32,928
Connor?

875
01:14:42,606 --> 01:14:44,815
(Sighs)

876
01:14:44,941 --> 01:14:48,319
We've lived many lives,
you and I.

877
01:14:48,445 --> 01:14:53,824
We've seen things that most people
could never understand.

878
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,702
But now what do you see?

879
01:14:56,828 --> 01:14:59,538
I see someone who would
never kill an unarmed man.

880
01:15:01,124 --> 01:15:05,503
I also see someone
who has lost hope.

881
01:15:05,629 --> 01:15:08,339
Life brings hope and pain...

882
01:15:10,717 --> 01:15:13,427
...but revenge
never brings redemption.

883
01:15:13,553 --> 01:15:16,555
The path and choice are ours.

884
01:15:23,647 --> 01:15:25,231
Connor, what the hell's going on?

885
01:15:26,066 --> 01:15:27,566
I have chosen mine.

886
01:15:27,692 --> 01:15:28,734
Aah!

887
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,277
What are you doing?

888
01:15:30,403 --> 01:15:33,572
Kell's too strong,
and he's getting stronger.

889
01:15:33,698 --> 01:15:36,158
Neither one of us can beat him alone.

890
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:39,245
Are you out of your mind?

891
01:15:41,414 --> 01:15:44,291
If we let him win,
it could mean the end.

892
01:15:50,173 --> 01:15:51,882
Connor, no!

893
01:15:54,427 --> 01:15:58,222
Kell is going to kill you, Duncan,
just to torment me,

894
01:15:58,348 --> 01:16:01,100
and there is nothing
you can do about it, nothing!

895
01:16:01,226 --> 01:16:03,060
I don't believe that, Connor.
Neither should you.

896
01:16:03,186 --> 01:16:05,854
Alone, neither one of us
can beat him.

897
01:16:05,981 --> 01:16:07,189
Together, we can.

898
01:16:07,315 --> 01:16:09,525
You know the rules.

899
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:11,652
Only one Immortal
can challenge another.

900
01:16:12,654 --> 01:16:14,113
And only one will.

901
01:16:15,115 --> 01:16:16,198
This isn't the answer.

902
01:16:16,992 --> 01:16:18,200
Listen to me.

903
01:16:18,326 --> 01:16:19,743
In the end,

904
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:24,164
there can be only one,
and that has to be you.

905
01:16:26,585 --> 01:16:28,085
No.

906
01:16:28,878 --> 01:16:30,129
We can beat him together.

907
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:32,715
Then we are in agreement.

908
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:45,811
Enough, Connor!

909
01:16:45,937 --> 01:16:50,024
I won't fight you.
I will never fight you, Connor.

910
01:16:50,525 --> 01:16:52,568
Then you die!

911
01:17:19,054 --> 01:17:21,513
No!
You're not doing this, Connor.

912
01:17:22,557 --> 01:17:24,933
Oh, yes, we're doing this.

913
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:30,147
Every day, every breath we took
was for this end.

914
01:17:33,568 --> 01:17:36,904
Look inside
and tell me I'm wrong.

915
01:17:56,883 --> 01:17:58,425
Aah!

916
01:18:00,387 --> 01:18:02,596
Aah! Aah!

917
01:18:07,936 --> 01:18:09,937
Do it!

918
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:15,275
I can't.

919
01:18:17,987 --> 01:18:20,155
Remember how
you first found me?

920
01:18:20,281 --> 01:18:24,618
Sitting in that bloody bog,
scared out of my mind?

921
01:18:24,744 --> 01:18:27,955
You taught me how to live, Connor.
You taught me why we live.

922
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:31,542
Have you forgotten all of that?

923
01:18:33,461 --> 01:18:34,962
No.

924
01:18:37,549 --> 01:18:41,051
Our bonds are all
that hold us in this world.

925
01:18:43,096 --> 01:18:45,097
Don't break this one.

926
01:18:49,686 --> 01:18:53,605
Please, Connor.
I'm begging you.

927
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,361
It's too late.

928
01:19:06,202 --> 01:19:08,662
This has to be done.

929
01:19:08,788 --> 01:19:10,205
Aah!

930
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:14,626
No, Connor!
Not like this!

931
01:19:14,753 --> 01:19:16,128
Come on, stop!

932
01:19:16,254 --> 01:19:18,839
- Connor, stop!
- Duncan!

933
01:19:23,428 --> 01:19:26,096
One of us has to die now,
old friend.

934
01:19:28,057 --> 01:19:29,558
No.

935
01:19:31,936 --> 01:19:33,729
And you know it.

936
01:19:35,815 --> 01:19:37,316
No.

937
01:19:40,612 --> 01:19:42,613
Goodbye, Duncan...

938
01:19:43,698 --> 01:19:45,866
...my true brother.

939
01:19:48,536 --> 01:19:50,788
I love you, Connor.

940
01:20:00,048 --> 01:20:01,757
Aah!

941
01:20:04,344 --> 01:20:05,844
No!

942
01:20:14,771 --> 01:20:16,396
Aah!

943
01:21:04,487 --> 01:21:07,030
(Screaming)

944
01:22:31,532 --> 01:22:35,118
(Hands clapping)

945
01:22:41,918 --> 01:22:43,418
Duncan.

946
01:22:44,212 --> 01:22:46,213
Well done.

947
01:22:50,218 --> 01:22:53,679
I ever thought
you had him in you.

948
01:22:55,682 --> 01:22:59,351
What does it feel like
to kill a brother?

949
01:23:00,269 --> 01:23:03,855
Feels good,
doesn't it?

950
01:23:04,983 --> 01:23:07,359
You'll never know, will you?

951
01:23:09,737 --> 01:23:13,156
Now you'll never have
Connor MacLeod's head.

952
01:23:14,367 --> 01:23:17,285
Are you going to run?

953
01:23:17,412 --> 01:23:20,247
Are you going to hide?

954
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:24,376
Run?

955
01:23:24,502 --> 01:23:26,878
(Grunts)

956
01:23:27,005 --> 01:23:29,214
Brother, come on!

957
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,550
Aah!

958
01:23:31,676 --> 01:23:33,010
(Grunts)

959
01:23:33,136 --> 01:23:35,387
Aah!

960
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,352
(Both screaming)

961
01:24:07,545 --> 01:24:09,671
How bad do you want it,
Duncan?

962
01:24:12,675 --> 01:24:14,092
You'll pay!

963
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,286
Aah!

964
01:24:59,138 --> 01:25:01,223
(Screams)

965
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:13,610
Duncan!

966
01:26:34,275 --> 01:26:36,109
(Grunts)

967
01:26:36,235 --> 01:26:39,905
OK, Kell. Come on.
Let's do this.

968
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:47,287
(Camera winding)

969
01:26:51,042 --> 01:26:52,584
Just watch.

970
01:27:16,442 --> 01:27:19,110
Merry Christmas.

971
01:27:40,716 --> 01:27:42,592
A valiant effort, Duncan.

972
01:27:43,594 --> 01:27:45,553
Too bad.

973
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,973
And this is just the beginning.

974
01:27:48,099 --> 01:27:53,228
You see, when you absorbed
Connor's spirit, you inherited his curse.

975
01:27:53,354 --> 01:27:56,648
Revenge is so sweet.

976
01:27:56,774 --> 01:27:59,401
I wonder who we'll start with?

977
01:28:05,408 --> 01:28:06,950
Oh, Kate.

978
01:28:08,202 --> 01:28:09,953
(Thunder)

979
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:11,246
(Whispering) 'Forever. '

980
01:28:12,873 --> 01:28:14,708
Oh, God.

981
01:28:16,043 --> 01:28:17,127
Kell!

982
01:28:19,088 --> 01:28:21,381
Jacob Kell!

983
01:28:23,676 --> 01:28:28,346
Revenge will never
bring you redemption,

984
01:28:28,472 --> 01:28:31,057
so I'm going to do it for you.

985
01:28:32,393 --> 01:28:34,144
Aah!

986
01:28:36,939 --> 01:28:38,940
Is that all you've got?

987
01:28:47,992 --> 01:28:51,453
(Kell) Duncan, I'd thought
I'd be home for dinner an hour ago,

988
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:53,496
but this is very impressive.

989
01:28:55,249 --> 01:28:58,668
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

990
01:28:58,794 --> 01:29:00,545
I'd be delighted.
Yah!

991
01:29:13,017 --> 01:29:16,311
Impressive... isn't it?

992
01:29:16,437 --> 01:29:17,937
Uh!

993
01:29:18,064 --> 01:29:18,980
Duncan!

994
01:29:19,106 --> 01:29:21,191
(Drops sword)

995
01:29:24,987 --> 01:29:27,655
You see at last your fate!

996
01:29:28,574 --> 01:29:31,701
Yes!
Because this game is done!

997
01:29:35,748 --> 01:29:37,415
Uh!

998
01:29:40,169 --> 01:29:41,878
Well, look on the bright side.

999
01:29:42,004 --> 01:29:44,339
At least
you went down swinging.

1000
01:29:44,465 --> 01:29:45,965

1001

'Don't you want to be inside me?

01:30:05,027 --> 01:30:06,111
'In the end... '

1006
01:30:06,821 --> 01:30:08,947
...there can be only one.

1007
01:30:20,084 --> 01:30:22,377
(Connor's voice) 'And you're not it. '

1008
01:30:24,296 --> 01:30:25,797
Call ya.

1009
01:30:47,528 --> 01:30:49,529
No!

1010

Hope you found peace,
my friend.
