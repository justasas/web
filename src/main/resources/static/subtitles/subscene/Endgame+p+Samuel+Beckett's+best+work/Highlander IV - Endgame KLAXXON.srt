1
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,294
Want a hot dog?

2
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,505
No, thanks.

3
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,005
Just ketchup, please.

4
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,679
Thanks.

5
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,376
Listen, I've got
an errand to run.

6
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:17,753
Kind of skimpy
on the ketchup.

7
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,856
Duncan, I've got to do this alone.

8
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:22,137
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

9
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:23,581
You called me in Paris,

10
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:26,035
and you said,
"We have to meet."

11
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,013
Now suddenly you've
got an errand to run?

12
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:31,225
What's going on?

13
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:32,953
I don't know.

14
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:34,135
It's...

15
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,782
nothing.

16
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:39,316
You okay?

17
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,767
Yeah. I'm okay.

18
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:45,212
Really.

19
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:48,626
I know you better
than that, Connor.

20
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,556
Haven't seen you like this.

21
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,844
People change, Duncan.

22
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,014
You'll learn that.

23
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:58,612
Fine.

24
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:00,824
You can tell me
all about it tonight.

25
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:03,576
8:00 at the bar.

26
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,783
And you're buying.

27
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,544
Right.

28
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:09,914
8:00, and I'm buying.

29
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,289
Mm-hmm.

30
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,795
You sure you gonna be
all right, Connor?

31
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,394
Of course.

32
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:18,515
Duncan...

33
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:24,091
watch your back.

34
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:51,663
Connor?

35
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:55,672
Connor?

36
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,175
Okay.

37
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,588
What is it, Connor?

38
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:41,645
Open it.

39
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,181
Oh, a ballerina.

40
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:46,355
Wow. She's beautiful.

41
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:48,212
Thank you.

42
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,685
Mmm, my angel.

43
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,104
Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you.

44
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:58,157
I love you, Connor.

45
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,604
I love you, my Rachel.

46
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,197
Oh, God,
I'm proud of you.

47
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,197
Thank you.

48
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:31,697
Hello?

49
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:43,114
Rachel!

50
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,618
Rachel.

51
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,634
My beloved Rachel.

52
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,394
How long has it been
since she died?

53
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,202
A year?
A century? More?

54
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,210
My mind keeps slipping,

55
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,383
but some things I know.

56
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:09,299
I am Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod,

57
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:14,120
and once,
a very long time ago,

58
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:16,530
I was a Highlander.

59
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:29,705
Born of this land,

60
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:32,712
and like this land, immortal.

61
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,136
Witch!

62
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,966
You brought
this plague on us.

63
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:49,066
You damned us all,
Connor MacLeod.

64
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,763
You sold your soul!

65
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:53,354
You're a witch!

66
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:54,319
You child of Satan!

67
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:55,465
They drove you from your home,

68
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,578
cut you off
from your own people.

69
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,406
What else do they want?

70
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:00,782
Someone to blame.

71
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,638
Your mother will burn!

72
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,079
Connor.

73
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,803
Your mother will burn!

74
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,400
Rot in hell!

75
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:09,033
Get in the house.

76
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,689
Get off my land!

77
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,321
Leave us in peace!

78
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,669
Get off my land!

79
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:21,580
Connor, please.

80
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:23,655
You're not going back
to Glenfinnan.

81
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:25,484
I have no choice.

82
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:26,926
Connor, please.

83
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,641
They can't hurt me,
and they know it,

84
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,329
but they can still
hurt the ones I love.

85
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,603
I'm afraid.

86
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,674
I love you, Heather.

87
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:39,847
More than anything in this world.

88
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,154
Do you believe me?

89
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,117
Yes.

90
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:44,841
Then don't be afraid.

91
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,082
Nothing can keep me from you.

92
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,758
Nothing.

93
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:45,449
Connor.

94
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,319
I thought you might be
the water horse...

95
00:09:49,387 --> 00:09:52,704
come to take me on his back
and drown me in the loch.

96
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:02,600
No one comes
to take care of you?

97
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,193
Not in years.

98
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:05,925
They think I bedevil
their children...

99
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:08,516
because my own was banished.

100
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:13,311
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:14,815
I'm so sorry.

102
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,982
Tiny mites...

103
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,602
and soured dispositions.

104
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,868
I've no need of them, Connor,

105
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,661
any of them.

106
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,375
Then it's settled.

107
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:34,726
You're coming with me.

108
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,119
Aah!

109
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,810
Connor!

110
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:45,311
Connor, what is it?

111
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:46,759
I'm not sure.

112
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:48,351
It happened once before.

113
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:49,373
Aah!

114
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,942
Aah! Connor!

115
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:57,918
In the name
of the Holy See...

116
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,839
and the rule of law,

117
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:03,271
you are hereby charged,

118
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:05,670
Connor MacLeod,

119
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:06,881
with heresy...

120
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:08,544
and the practice
of black magic.

121
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:11,036
We were friends, remember, Jacob?

122
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:12,802
I stood at your ordination.

123
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,213
I vouched for you.

124
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,970
You shouldn't have
come back, Connor.

125
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,347
Take him.

126
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:19,429
Aah!

127
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:28,732
The ties of blood...

128
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:33,541
cannot be severed
by word or deed.

129
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:41,893
Mother.

130
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,747
Due to
the infinite compassion...

131
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:50,494
you are entitled
to one final opportunity...

132
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:52,420
to renounce all that is unholy,

133
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:56,827
and declare Connor MacLeod
not of your loins.

134
00:11:58,373 --> 00:12:00,096
How say you,
Caiolin MacLeod?

135
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:04,511
If your God...

136
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,540
should persecute me
into the next world,

137
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:11,482
then I shall simply have
to find myself another.

138
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:15,394
Burn her!

139
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:17,696
No! No! No!

140
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:20,859
He is your son.

141
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:23,747
I am silent for you.

142
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:32,577
Black powder.

143
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:33,986
It will ease your suffering.

144
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:38,976
Mother!

145
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:44,576
No!

146
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:48,829
No!

147
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,165
You're next, you demon!

148
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:29,305
Aah!

149
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:51,325
Aah!

150
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:56,153
My water horse.

151
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,489
Unh!

152
00:14:18,686 --> 00:14:20,858
The Devil's come back to life!

153
00:14:29,277 --> 00:14:31,349
Let her be, Connor.

154
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:33,810
Aah!

155
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:38,811
Father?

156
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,884
Father?

157
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,697
Please.

158
00:14:43,773 --> 00:14:45,747
Do not leave me.

159
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:48,533
Father.

160
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,180
Aah!

161
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,494
Connor--

162
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:48,914
My endless days...

163
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:52,467
are filled with memories
of the past...

164
00:15:52,538 --> 00:15:55,473
and the death of my mother
by Jacob Kell.

165
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:33,646
Boy, you people are
extremely difficult to find.

166
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,312
We like it that way.

167
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:46,355
Go ahead, man.
Take your pick.

168
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,013
Unh!

169
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,286
Uhh!

170
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:01,200
Aah!

171
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,333
Aah.

172
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:11,826
Take their heads.

173
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,483
They might be Immortals.

174
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:15,528
Yes, they might be.

175
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,828
Aah!

176
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,766
Don't be long.

177
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:01,000
The Sanctuary.

178
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:03,658
So it's true.

179
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:15,247
What sacrifices
they have made of you,

180
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:19,087
warehoused like
rotting pieces of meat.

181
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:25,449
Tell me,

182
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,453
is this... the better way?

183
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:32,902
I'm sure you've had
time to reflect upon it.

184
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,333
What you need to understand...

185
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:39,148
is that I don't care
about the game.

186
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:41,581
I don't care about the rules.

187
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:44,995
I don't even care about
these pathetic souls...

188
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,055
you keep locked away
as a barrier to the prize.

189
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:54,380
Which one is
Connor MacLeod?

190
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:57,098
Well, what do we do now?

191
00:20:57,163 --> 00:20:59,497
What we always do.

192
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,603
We're Watchers, not cops.

193
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:03,747
We'll find another volunteer.

194
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:50,205
Whatever you fear
about Connor MacLeod,

195
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,775
fear the worst.

196
00:21:53,991 --> 00:21:55,072
Who is this?

197
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:56,551
A friend.

198
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,714
Don't bother looking for me, Duncan.

199
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,714
He's on the move.

200
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:24,037
Duncan MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

201
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:26,011
Hello, Methos.

202
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:29,052
What brings you
to my humble abode?

203
00:22:29,126 --> 00:22:31,166
Need your help.

204
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:32,481
Why me?

205
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:35,069
You've been around for 5,000 years.

206
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:39,516
I want the benefit
of your experience.

207
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:42,852
And I thought
it was a social call.

208
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:45,892
You ever had nightmares?

209
00:22:45,957 --> 00:22:48,292
What kind of nightmares?

210
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:49,502
Bloody images...

211
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:52,289
powerful enough to even
break your meditation.

212
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:56,067
We live violent lives, MacLeod.

213
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,042
Some of that's
bound to stay with us.

214
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,703
These ones came
10 years to the day...

215
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:02,431
that Connor MacLeod disappeared.

216
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,635
Connor had good reason to go.

217
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,937
He told me how much
Rachel meant to him.

218
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:11,299
There was more to it than that.
I was with him that day.

219
00:23:11,364 --> 00:23:13,186
The day Rachel was killed?

220
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:15,488
Something wasn't right.

221
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:16,734
Connor, you okay?

222
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:20,578
Yeah. I'm okay.
Really.

223
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:23,098
I know you better
than that, Connor.

224
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:26,269
I've never seen you like this.

225
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,273
People change, Duncan.

226
00:23:29,347 --> 00:23:30,873
You'll learn that.

227
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:34,912
I need to know
if he's still alive, Methos.

228
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,457
You know a little
about Buddhist monks.

229
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:40,385
Some of them come
to cherish life so much...

230
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:44,312
that to step on an insect
or harm a blade of grass...

231
00:23:44,386 --> 00:23:46,426
becomes a violation
of their creed,

232
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,190
so they place themselves
under an extreme form...

233
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,201
of protective custody--

234
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:52,827
A Sanctuary of sorts.

235
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,524
Well, for an Immortal...

236
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:56,153
who comes to abhor
the bloodshed,

237
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,495
there's a similar solution--

238
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,017
Away to be removed
from the game forever.

239
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,031
The price
is unimaginably high,

240
00:24:03,105 --> 00:24:05,112
but you are, for
all practical purposes,

241
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:09,375
protected from
the violence within you.

242
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,481
And it's called The Sanctuary.

243
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:13,441
Connor would never do that.

244
00:24:13,505 --> 00:24:14,682
Are you sure?

245
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:16,607
It's been around since
before you were born.

246
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,811
At least until last night.

247
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:20,572
What happened last night?

248
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,390
It was annihilated.

249
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,021
Hey, Duncan, what's the matter?

250
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:42,036
The British...

251
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:43,638
destroyed the clans, Connor.

252
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:45,402
Scotland's finished.

253
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:48,373
Scotland will always be Scotland,

254
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,269
and someday you'll go back.

255
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:51,709
You can bet on it.

256
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:52,669
How much?

257
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:53,718
Aw, come on.

258
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,508
Does everything have
to be a wager with you?

259
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:58,036
Well, you're the one
that keeps telling me...

260
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,249
our lives are nothing
but a boundless game.

261
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:04,022
Good morning, gentlemen.

262
00:25:04,094 --> 00:25:06,483
What seems to be
the problem here?

263
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,176
They refuses to pay her toll, sir.

264
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:10,937
Really? How dare they.

265
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:12,380
These men are rogues.

266
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,649
These men are
liars and scoundrels, sir.

267
00:25:14,718 --> 00:25:17,500
They've done nothing but
prey upon us 3 years running,

268
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:19,453
right at this very spot.

269
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,690
And by whose authority
do you act?

270
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:22,903
By Deed of the King.

271
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:27,705
There is a little "X" down here.

272
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:30,773
Does the King always
sign his name with an "X"?

273
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,251
Excuse me. Sorry. Ha ha.

274
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:33,746
I think these gentlemen
should be paid.

275
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,250
That deed is a fake.

276
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,601
That's a matter of opinion.

277
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,644
You, sir, are
no better than they.

278
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:41,084
That is also a matter of opinion.

279
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,130
Here you go.

280
00:25:43,517 --> 00:25:45,175
Ladies.

281
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,000
It's gold!

282
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:48,376
Why not--
It's gold.

283
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:49,818
First man: Ha ha!

284
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,771
Hey, wait a minute.
They took my money!

285
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:53,178
Oh, it's here.

286
00:25:53,244 --> 00:25:54,650
They took my money!

287
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:55,926
Let's go get 'em!

288
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:57,425
Shall we?

289
00:25:58,779 --> 00:25:59,989
Aye.

290
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,263
Aah!

291
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:06,580
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

292
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:17,015
Heh heh.

293
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:17,976
Not bad.

294
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,156
Uh-oh.

295
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:21,874
Mmm.

296
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:26,006
All right boys, time to go.
Let's go!

297
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:26,968
Come on!

298
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:30,616
Ohh. Cuckoo.

299
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:32,570
Oh, looks heavy, huh?

300
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,292
Looks like
you lost your edge, lad.

301
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:35,256
Really heavy.

302
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:36,783
Or could he be lass?

303
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:38,134
Could be.

304
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:39,095
Could be.

305
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:43,538
Hyah!

306
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:45,719
Come on!

307
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:48,119
Hyah! Hyah!

308
00:26:50,297 --> 00:26:51,190
Hyah!

309
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,008
Corporal Duncan MacLeod, sir.

310
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:43,530
I've come to pick up
the wounded.

311
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,006
You've improved greatly.

312
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:22,535
Ah, you really think so?

313
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:28,623
No.

314
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:31,054
I'm just being gracious.

315
00:29:31,122 --> 00:29:31,655
Hmm.

316
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:35,340
Now, remember.

317
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,002
You are only immortal...

318
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:39,494
as long as you
can keep your head...

319
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:40,680
on your shoulders.

320
00:29:44,177 --> 00:29:45,256
Gahh.

321
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:48,808
Duncan, what you give up
to your adversary...

322
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,855
in defeat...

323
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:51,944
is everything.

324
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:54,023
I know.
And at that point,

325
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:55,918
I'm very, very dead.
Come on!

326
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:56,878
Heh heh heh.

327
00:29:56,944 --> 00:29:59,311
Not just dead, Duncan--

328
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,269
Empty!

329
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,966
Aye, Connor, I know.
It's called the Quickening.

330
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,047
Our strength and knowledge,
our life essence,

331
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,679
flows into the victor, feeds him,

332
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:10,442
and makes him stronger, yes?

333
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:12,584
It's what drives
the other Immortals...

334
00:30:12,656 --> 00:30:13,583
to kill us,

335
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,075
and what forces us...

336
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:16,677
to be smarter,
better than the rest.

337
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,823
I understand.

338
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:21,577
Ooh.

339
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:24,812
You do?

340
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,208
Ohh.

341
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:28,172
Good.

342
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:31,723
I slipped.

343
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,660
Listen, soon you and I
will have to part.

344
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:37,036
There is one more thing
I want to give to you.

345
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:41,803
Va via. Va via!

346
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:42,982
Ho ho ho.

347
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:44,199
Oh, aye!

348
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,586
Oh, aye. This is
much more to my liking.

349
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:48,556
Good.

350
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:50,149
Bah! Heh heh heh.

351
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,115
Heh heh heh.

352
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,351
Attack me.

353
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,323
But you've got your back to me.

354
00:30:57,453 --> 00:31:00,584
It's not always
about strength, Duncan.

355
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:01,580
Attack me!

356
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:08,840
Aah!

357
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:11,624
It's about manipulation
of the mind...

358
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:16,898
as well as the body.

359
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:19,590
Aye, but now I'm in control.

360
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:21,895
Heh heh heh. Are you?

361
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:31,715
Remember well, my friend.

362
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:35,136
Properly executed,
this move is unstoppable.

363
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,688
Properly executed,
we'll nae have this talk again.

364
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,844
Who are you?

365
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:06,466
A friend... or a lover.

366
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:08,480
Or a wife.

367
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:09,601
Kate?

368
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:11,134
Attaboy.

369
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:14,078
Except I'm Faith now.

370
00:32:14,153 --> 00:32:16,574
Part of the makeover.

371
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,175
What are you doing here?

372
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:20,868
Remember our wedding day,
Duncan?

373
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,312
I do.

374
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:26,344
The way we danced.

375
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,278
I felt like we were flying.

376
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,357
Of course,
we did come down...

377
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:41,317
didn't we?

378
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,110
Crashing.

379
00:32:50,023 --> 00:32:51,518
Oh, shit.

380
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,883
It's time to show
our Immortal brother...

381
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,081
a thing or two.

382
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:16,805
Somebody order
a club sandwich?

383
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,204
He's funny.
Nice outfit, too.

384
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:21,889
Faith, I told you I look
like a fuckin' orange!

385
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,379
I'm not dressing you black, Bob.
Trust me.

386
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:25,314
Who are they?

387
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:28,545
Friends.

388
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:30,021
What, it's a team sport now?

389
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:31,514
What, you didn't know?

390
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:34,786
It's a whole new ball game.

391
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:36,708
Aah!

392
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:54,554
Hey!

393
00:33:56,324 --> 00:33:57,534
Nice bat.

394
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,241
Aargh!

395
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:11,769
Told you I was gonna cut you.

396
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:22,815
Aaah!

397
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,554
Let my man Jin Ke
deal with him.

398
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:36,351
Jin Ke...

399
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,978
who served with
the Emperor Chin.

400
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,221
The same man.

401
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,231
Some people say
you're a man of honor.

402
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:44,159
What do you know about honor?

403
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,578
Oh, great.

404
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:50,010
Yaah!

405
00:35:32,287 --> 00:35:34,938
Honor's not in a weapon.

406
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,217
It's in the man.

407
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:04,726
Enough!

408
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:10,387
Boys, boys.

409
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:12,949
I do apologize.

410
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,443
When it comes to discipline,

411
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:19,259
the first hundred years
are the hardest.

412
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:23,539
Ohh!

413
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:25,850
Ohh!

414
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,849
Guess I'm not much
of a swords guy.

415
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:34,291
I thought I told you to stop.

416
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:37,115
Yeah, well,

417
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,390
I stopped.

418
00:36:38,459 --> 00:36:39,441
Tell me, Carlos.

419
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:41,883
How much is your life worth?

420
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:44,315
Don't start this bullshit, man.

421
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,998
'Cause the only way
to win your freedom...

422
00:36:47,068 --> 00:36:48,693
is to kill me.

423
00:36:48,764 --> 00:36:49,658
You're crazy.

424
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:50,771
Am I?

425
00:36:50,843 --> 00:36:52,752
Then go ahead.

426
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:55,610
Stop the madness.

427
00:36:57,275 --> 00:37:00,374
Can you live with the fear?

428
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:03,126
Can you live
with the weakness?

429
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,366
Weakness, Carlos.

430
00:37:13,946 --> 00:37:15,604
I call this...

431
00:37:15,674 --> 00:37:18,325
decap with a twist--

432
00:37:18,394 --> 00:37:19,571
No sugar.

433
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:05,774
Watchers?

434
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,058
Huh?

435
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:11,375
Watchers observe Immortals.

436
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:13,552
They're not supposed
to interfere.

437
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:16,208
Unfortunately, our role
has changed somewhat.

438
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:17,588
Why?

439
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:19,509
Because the rules
have been broken.

440
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:23,349
One of your kind
has gone renegade.

441
00:38:25,974 --> 00:38:28,527
In doing so, he's gained
himself a sizable advantage.

442
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,087
One that'll be
impossible to overcome.

443
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:32,435
Nobody's unbeatable.

444
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:34,924
Oh, yes, Duncan. He is.

445
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:39,947
Unbeatable.

446
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:44,784
No.

447
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:55,539
Ahh.

448
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:57,612
Sorry about that.

449
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:01,650
There must always be
two of your kind.

450
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:03,244
As long as there are two,

451
00:39:03,316 --> 00:39:04,843
and you're kept from fighting,

452
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:06,706
then the prize is safe.

453
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:09,674
The Sanctuary must not fail again.

454
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:10,925
You're insane.

455
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:13,330
Get yourself another volunteer.

456
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:17,192
We had a number of volunteers!

457
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:20,530
Sadly, that's
no longer the case.

458
00:39:20,596 --> 00:39:22,058
You'll be warehoused,

459
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:23,474
hidden away.

460
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,718
Go to hell.

461
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:25,933
Don't worry.

462
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:29,645
The drugs'll kick in momentarily.

463
00:40:07,377 --> 00:40:08,424
Get up.

464
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:10,601
Get up!

465
00:40:17,841 --> 00:40:20,688
You have better things to do
than lie there on your ass.

466
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,240
Who are you?

467
00:40:23,313 --> 00:40:25,549
Someone who knows
more about you...

468
00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:27,242
than you know about yourself.

469
00:40:27,313 --> 00:40:28,557
Are you a demon?

470
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,567
Heh, heh heh.

471
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,917
I've been called that...

472
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:33,064
and worse.

473
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:37,324
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

474
00:40:37,392 --> 00:40:39,083
Connor MacLeod?

475
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:42,022
And like you, my friend,

476
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:44,037
I have a hard time dying.

477
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:00,806
Dawson?

478
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:03,493
Heh, you look like shit.

479
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:04,647
Thanks.

480
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,126
How long have I--

481
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:07,020
We'll talk about it later.

482
00:41:07,088 --> 00:41:08,015
We gotta get outta here.

483
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,894
Come on, can you walk?

484
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:11,886
Yeah.

485
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,997
Uhh.

486
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:31,211
Go. Go!

487
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:32,554
What are you doing here?

488
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:33,450
Keeping tabs on you.

489
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:34,924
Yeah?

490
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:36,166
Well...

491
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:37,448
someone should keep tabs...

492
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:39,207
on that psychotic asshole
back there.

493
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:40,803
Didn't you get it
back in London?

494
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:43,081
These guys don't play by the rules.

495
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:44,807
You don't know what
you're up against, Mac.

496
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,120
So people keep telling me.

497
00:41:46,188 --> 00:41:47,433
Stop the car.

498
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:49,834
I managed to liberate that
from their lost and found.

499
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,688
There's blood on it.

500
00:41:51,755 --> 00:41:53,544
I didn't say it was easy.

501
00:41:53,613 --> 00:41:54,506
Pull over.

502
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:56,395
What?

503
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:57,889
Pull over.

504
00:41:57,965 --> 00:42:00,485
MacLeod, tell me something.

505
00:42:00,556 --> 00:42:01,603
Mac, hear him out!

506
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:04,065
Mac! Will you
tell me something?

507
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,474
Now, how many Quickenings
have you had?

508
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,433
How many heads
have you taken?

509
00:42:10,507 --> 00:42:12,416
I don't keep score.

510
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:14,628
Well, we do.

511
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,073
MacLeod, Connor.

512
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,350
What's that?

513
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:27,077
The Watchers' version
of a resumé.

514
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:32,961
It's a bit like
handicapping horses, I know,

515
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:34,310
but it's part
of the gig, all right?

516
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:39,912
174 confirmed Immortal kills.

517
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,451
Sound about right?

518
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,495
So, what's your point?

519
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:49,253
Here's the gentleman
you met in Connor's loft.

520
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,290
661 confirmed Immortal kills.

521
00:43:00,106 --> 00:43:02,494
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

522
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:04,773
Sanctuary wasn't shit, pal.

523
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:07,394
This guy is way
out of your league.

524
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:14,117
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.

525
00:43:14,184 --> 00:43:16,867
Why?

526
00:43:16,936 --> 00:43:18,213
Something
doesn't make sense.

527
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:21,025
What are you saying?

528
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:24,543
I think he's saying
he wants to see the body.

529
00:43:24,616 --> 00:43:26,307
Well, it's gonna be a rough I.D.

530
00:43:26,376 --> 00:43:28,764
They're all missing their heads!

531
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:09,794
We gave 'em
a Christian burial, MacLeod.

532
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:11,072
It was decent, you know.

533
00:44:11,142 --> 00:44:12,734
Said all the right words.

534
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:15,172
Can't begin to tell you
how reassuring that is.

535
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:16,579
With all these
unexplained corpses,

536
00:44:16,645 --> 00:44:20,257
well, we had to take it
off the beaten track.

537
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,852
End of the road, Joe.

538
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:25,379
Thanks.

539
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:29,411
You watch your ass, MacLeod.

540
00:44:29,476 --> 00:44:31,648
It's not my ass
I'm worried about.

541
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,859
Did I happen to mention
about all this...

542
00:44:36,932 --> 00:44:38,078
coming to a bad end?

543
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:40,156
No, Methos.

544
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:41,755
I don't believe you did.

545
00:44:47,587 --> 00:44:48,929
You were gonna stay and dig.

546
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:51,548
Dig? Oh, yeah!

547
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:18,555
I need to know
if he's still alive, Professor.

548
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:21,942
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.

549
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:25,881
One of your kind
has gone renegade.

550
00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:33,600
People change, Duncan.

551
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,094
You'll learn that.

552
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:02,489
No.

553
00:46:09,824 --> 00:46:11,449
What are you doing here?

554
00:46:12,927 --> 00:46:15,610
You walked out
on your life, Connor.

555
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:16,627
Why?

556
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:21,242
I had my reasons.

557
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,871
Reasons?

558
00:46:25,664 --> 00:46:27,997
Every life I touch ends...

559
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,078
brutally...

560
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,476
and for no reason.

561
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:34,070
It's a curse...

562
00:46:34,142 --> 00:46:36,346
that's followed me for centuries.

563
00:46:37,726 --> 00:46:42,003
I can't outrun it,
and I can't outlive it.

564
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,876
Rachel's death made you
the last soul on this planet...

565
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,194
that means a damn to me.

566
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,979
I thought there was a way out.

567
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:51,028
The Sanctuary?

568
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:53,755
Yes.

569
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:57,810
The Sanctuary.

570
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:00,149
So, how did you escape?

571
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:03,317
I didn't escape.

572
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:06,452
I was let go.

573
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:12,855
I couldn't see the slaughter,

574
00:47:12,925 --> 00:47:13,972
only heard it...

575
00:47:15,357 --> 00:47:16,251
and felt it.

576
00:47:47,643 --> 00:47:48,952
Jacob Kell.

577
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,522
So, here we are--

578
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:03,699
Both immortal.

579
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,006
Missed the signs,

580
00:48:06,074 --> 00:48:07,961
didn't we?

581
00:48:08,027 --> 00:48:11,473
But we were both
so new at the game.

582
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:15,702
Connor.

583
00:48:16,986 --> 00:48:20,052
What a glorious sight.

584
00:48:21,786 --> 00:48:23,825
Just look, Connor.

585
00:48:25,593 --> 00:48:28,942
Look back at the endless
travesties of your life,

586
00:48:29,017 --> 00:48:30,512
and you'll see me,

587
00:48:30,585 --> 00:48:33,171
always there
waiting in the shadows.

588
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:34,964
When friends and lovers...

589
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:36,593
are wiped from your sight--

590
00:48:37,657 --> 00:48:38,639
I'm there.

591
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:40,371
When those you cherish...

592
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:43,375
die abruptly and for no reason--

593
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:45,302
I'm there for you.

594
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:47,701
And when your cellmates...

595
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:50,386
in their so-called Sanctuary...

596
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:53,389
are left twitching
like headless chickens--

597
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:55,862
Guess who?

598
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:01,815
Connor.

599
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,116
Stay out of it, Duncan.

600
00:49:08,376 --> 00:49:10,677
Would you kill
an unarmed man...

601
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:11,888
again, Connor?

602
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:14,036
Oh!

603
00:49:14,102 --> 00:49:16,688
You didn't know, Duncan?

604
00:49:17,879 --> 00:49:20,628
Because you didn't tell him.

605
00:49:20,694 --> 00:49:22,800
Would that finally
put the agony...

606
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:25,041
in your soul to rest?

607
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:27,891
Then go ahead.

608
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,478
Send me home.

609
00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:33,004
What's stopping you?

610
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:34,354
Honor?

611
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:37,105
Guilt?

612
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:39,344
The nagging sense that maybe you,

613
00:49:39,412 --> 00:49:40,689
more than I, deserve to die?

614
00:49:42,165 --> 00:49:43,725
Or somewhere along the way...

615
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:47,343
did you just lose your nerve?

616
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:48,658
It's holy ground, Connor.

617
00:49:48,726 --> 00:49:50,580
Ooh.

618
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:52,172
Yes.

619
00:49:52,245 --> 00:49:54,765
Take your shot.

620
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:57,453
What better chance than now?

621
00:49:57,524 --> 00:49:59,565
Do it.

622
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:04,338
Do it for your sweet mother.

623
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:06,609
Aah!

624
00:50:06,677 --> 00:50:09,426
Or the sweet little war orphan...

625
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:13,234
Rachel Ellenstein...

626
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:17,549
who, if I'm not mistaken,

627
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,107
you raised
as your own daughter.

628
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:22,251
Tell me, do they even begin...

629
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:24,625
to equal for the murder
of a man of God...

630
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:26,763
who raised me as his own son?

631
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:29,039
Aah!

632
00:50:30,738 --> 00:50:32,112
Slow...

633
00:50:32,178 --> 00:50:33,837
close--

634
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,808
Feels good, doesn't it?

635
00:50:36,882 --> 00:50:38,922
But look at you.

636
00:50:39,987 --> 00:50:42,834
Even now, you're afraid--

637
00:50:42,899 --> 00:50:44,590
Afraid you'll lose.

638
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:46,600
That's your true fear, isn't it?

639
00:50:46,674 --> 00:50:49,162
The thought of giving up
your essence to me,

640
00:50:49,234 --> 00:50:52,812
making me
even stronger by it.

641
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:56,269
What's wrong?

642
00:50:56,338 --> 00:50:59,818
Don't you want
to be inside me?

643
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,749
I want you to think back
to this moment, Connor!

644
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:35,911
In the endless nights ahead!

645
00:51:35,984 --> 00:51:37,478
Aah!

646
00:51:50,735 --> 00:51:51,880
And know...

647
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:53,292
Aah!

648
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,246
every time
you close your eyes...

649
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:58,659
from now to eternity,
I'll be there!

650
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:04,647
Ripping apart the ones
you care about most!

651
00:52:04,718 --> 00:52:06,147
Aah!

652
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:18,026
It's never over,
Connor MacLeod.

653
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,744
Living is what matters.

654
00:52:20,813 --> 00:52:23,812
And you will live with this.

655
00:52:23,886 --> 00:52:24,813
Count on it.

656
00:52:24,878 --> 00:52:26,567
One far-off day,

657
00:52:26,638 --> 00:52:29,004
you and I will be
the only two remaining.

658
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:30,443
You will look back on this...

659
00:52:30,509 --> 00:52:34,306
and know you had
one chance to stop me.

660
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:35,788
You failed.

661
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:37,675
But until that day,

662
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:39,683
I will take my vengeance...

663
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,698
on those you love.

664
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:45,798
Your living...
has been my prize.

665
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:48,038
For old times' sake.

666
00:52:49,772 --> 00:52:51,681
He is your son.

667
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:58,663
You, on the other hand...

668
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,325
are on borrowed time.

669
00:53:04,395 --> 00:53:05,540
Call you.

670
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:11,943
Is what he said true?

671
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,163
Is it?

672
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,787
Believe only what your heart...

673
00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:20,964
and conscience tell you.

674
00:53:23,147 --> 00:53:24,739
Connor...

675
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:26,818
with time, anything
can be forgiven.

676
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:28,581
You taught me that.

677
00:53:33,737 --> 00:53:35,395
Did I?

678
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,022
Oh, look at Dave. Dave!

679
00:54:05,096 --> 00:54:06,503
Behave yourself, Duncan!

680
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:08,357
No more talking!

681
00:54:08,424 --> 00:54:12,166
May all your hardships fade away.

682
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:14,437
Till night becomes morn,

683
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:17,352
let love remain
to guide your way.

684
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:19,390
Till the day we are reborn.

685
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,406
Till the day we are reborn.

686
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:23,748
Kiss her, won't you?

687
00:54:32,262 --> 00:54:33,441
Connor?

688
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:38,307
I thought you'd never get here.

689
00:54:38,374 --> 00:54:40,447
Connor!

690
00:54:43,494 --> 00:54:46,625
You know
Kate is like us, immortal.

691
00:54:46,694 --> 00:54:48,865
Aye. I sensed something
the day we met,

692
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:50,395
but I wasn't sure.

693
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,339
Well, now you know.

694
00:54:53,413 --> 00:54:55,802
And you know as well as I do...

695
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:59,522
that her Immortality
can only be triggered...

696
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,720
by the shock of a violent death.

697
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,765
Yes, I do.

698
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:05,786
And without such a death,

699
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:07,203
she will simply
grow old and die.

700
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:08,862
Yes, I know, Connor.

701
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:11,388
Is that what you came
to tell me on my wedding day?

702
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:13,850
Come on.
Drink up, man.

703
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,406
No.

704
00:55:17,477 --> 00:55:19,680
I was wondering.

705
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:23,012
Does she know?

706
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:26,049
Why?

707
00:55:30,629 --> 00:55:34,140
Many years
after I was married,

708
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:38,274
one night...

709
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:40,706
I found Heather
in front of the house.

710
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:44,087
She had a knife in one hand...

711
00:55:44,163 --> 00:55:45,985
and her hair in the other.

712
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:47,131
When I asked her...

713
00:55:47,203 --> 00:55:49,439
why she had done such
a thing to herself,

714
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:51,895
she said it was
the one part of her...

715
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,076
that would never age.

716
00:55:54,147 --> 00:55:56,481
It would forever
remain the same...

717
00:55:56,547 --> 00:55:58,969
as when I first
fell in love with her.

718
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,684
That's how she wanted me
to remember her.

719
00:56:02,754 --> 00:56:05,405
Why are you telling me this?

720
00:56:05,474 --> 00:56:08,223
Because I once loved a woman...

721
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:09,599
more than life itself--

722
00:56:13,218 --> 00:56:15,127
and I watched her die.

723
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:20,319
Unlike me, you have a choice.

724
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,724
What would you have me tell her?

725
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:39,996
I'd tell her nothing.

726
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:41,079
She wouldn't believe you anyway.

727
00:56:41,152 --> 00:56:42,581
Then I can do nothing.

728
00:56:42,656 --> 00:56:44,892
She's in the flower of her youth.

729
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,644
Enjoy the moment,
and let it pass.

730
00:56:47,712 --> 00:56:49,916
And if it were you in my place?

731
00:56:49,984 --> 00:56:51,926
I was in your place!

732
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:56,280
But I thank God
I never had the choice.

733
00:56:56,352 --> 00:56:58,075
I love Kate,

734
00:56:58,144 --> 00:57:00,184
and I will hold on to her
as long as I can.

735
00:57:00,256 --> 00:57:02,677
And that is all I can do!

736
00:57:07,648 --> 00:57:09,503
Forever, my love.

737
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:13,081
Until the day we are reborn.

738
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:15,963
Until the day we are reborn.

739
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,090
You haven't lost your touch.

740
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,433
What do you want?

741
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,393
To talk.

742
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,507
Oh, that's a first.

743
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,725
I've tried to talk to you
a thousand times--

744
00:58:16,796 --> 00:58:18,584
Get to the point.

745
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:19,796
I was wrong.

746
00:58:19,867 --> 00:58:21,176
Oh, no, no.

747
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:22,705
Stealing's wrong.

748
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:24,820
Lying's wrong.
Killing's wrong.

749
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:26,746
What you did
goes well beyond wrong.

750
00:58:26,811 --> 00:58:28,152
Fine.

751
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:29,942
I deserve that,

752
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,386
but I want a chance
to make it right.

753
00:58:31,452 --> 00:58:33,306
You want to make it right?

754
00:58:33,371 --> 00:58:34,386
Then give me back the ability...

755
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:36,182
to have children,

756
00:58:36,251 --> 00:58:38,553
to grow old
with the man I love.

757
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:40,757
How about anything that
resembles a normal life?

758
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:42,998
And you took it all
away from me.

759
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:44,146
Those things I can't give you.

760
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:47,153
Oh, something else
you forgot to tell me.

761
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:49,553
Good-bye, Duncan.

762
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,219
Kell can't give you
those things, either,

763
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,934
so tell me, Kate, why him?

764
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:56,496
Because I've never
known anybody...

765
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,156
with such a capacity for hate--

766
00:58:59,226 --> 00:59:00,469
Except me.

767
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,636
That's what's kept you
going all these years?

768
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:04,632
Hmm?

769
00:59:07,097 --> 00:59:08,045
Fine.

770
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:11,439
Go home, Faith.

771
00:59:13,176 --> 00:59:15,543
Take care of what's important.

772
01:00:34,485 --> 01:00:37,834
You were with him.

773
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:41,841
A woman is a temple...

774
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:45,389
built on a sewer.

775
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:50,955
Remember what you were
when I first found you.

776
01:00:52,564 --> 01:00:54,953
A whore.

777
01:00:56,179 --> 01:00:58,961
Now, look at you.

778
01:00:59,027 --> 01:01:01,297
A liberated whore.

779
01:01:01,364 --> 01:01:02,508
Fuck you.

780
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:06,060
Oh, we'll get to that, blossom.

781
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,106
But in the interim, be grateful...

782
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:11,660
I don't take
your pretty little face off.

783
01:01:11,732 --> 01:01:14,765
Hurts, doesn't it...

784
01:01:16,147 --> 01:01:19,692
that there is something
you actually can't have?

785
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:23,793
Hmm. I can have...

786
01:01:23,858 --> 01:01:26,225
anything I want.

787
01:01:27,698 --> 01:01:29,585
Except me.

788
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:35,561
I've already had you.

789
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:42,060
Not really.

790
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:49,741
Close enough.

791
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:01,316
Forever.

792
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:38,791
May love remain
to guide our way...

793
01:04:38,857 --> 01:04:40,613
till the day we are reborn.

794
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:47,168
Forgive me.

795
01:04:48,777 --> 01:04:50,337
Uhh!

796
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:06,271
I'm sorry.

797
01:05:07,911 --> 01:05:10,594
You had no right.

798
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:28,606
Uhh!

799
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:33,185
Kate?

800
01:05:33,255 --> 01:05:34,683
No. Don't be frightened.

801
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:35,904
You're immortal.
We both are.

802
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:37,916
Aah!

803
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:38,884
Uhh!

804
01:05:40,455 --> 01:05:43,356
I did it for you--

805
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,378
For us.

806
01:05:44,454 --> 01:05:45,861
- Uhh!
- Kate.

807
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:46,819
Kate?

808
01:05:46,885 --> 01:05:47,965
Oh, no!

809
01:05:48,038 --> 01:05:49,150
Oh, no.

810
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:50,628
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

811
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:52,220
Kate!

812
01:05:52,293 --> 01:05:54,496
You wanted this.

813
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:57,631
You forced it on me.

814
01:05:57,701 --> 01:05:59,740
I never asked for eternity.

815
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:04,164
I never wanted us to be apart.

816
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:09,377
Would you have really understood?

817
01:06:09,444 --> 01:06:10,720
Which part?

818
01:06:10,788 --> 01:06:14,136
The endless, numbing
sameness of it all?

819
01:06:14,212 --> 01:06:16,416
Or never bothering
to love someone...

820
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:19,582
because whole lifetimes
tick by so fast...

821
01:06:19,651 --> 01:06:20,862
they don't even count anymore?

822
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:24,864
Then why did you come?

823
01:06:26,244 --> 01:06:29,559
To see if I could feel again--

824
01:06:29,636 --> 01:06:31,391
Anything.

825
01:06:48,994 --> 01:06:51,001
You're missing the point, Kate.

826
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:53,311
The difference
between Connor and I...

827
01:06:53,378 --> 01:06:54,719
is that as long
as you're still alive,

828
01:06:54,787 --> 01:06:56,609
there's a chance that one day...

829
01:06:56,674 --> 01:06:57,601
I might be forgiven.

830
01:06:57,666 --> 01:06:59,576
It may take years--

831
01:07:00,738 --> 01:07:02,145
Centuries, even.

832
01:07:03,522 --> 01:07:05,528
But at least I can
carry that hope inside me.

833
01:07:05,601 --> 01:07:08,055
That's one blessing
of immortality--

834
01:07:09,985 --> 01:07:11,895
There's always tomorrow.

835
01:07:14,304 --> 01:07:15,418
Even for us.

836
01:07:33,152 --> 01:07:36,251
What are you doing, Jin?

837
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,748
Just thinking.

838
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:40,857
Men, for the most part,

839
01:07:40,928 --> 01:07:42,334
can mend their ways...

840
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,117
only after they have made
a mistake.

841
01:07:47,232 --> 01:07:48,246
One day soon,

842
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,228
we will all...

843
01:07:50,303 --> 01:07:52,670
serve very little purpose to Kell,

844
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,328
except dead.

845
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:10,747
A toast.

846
01:08:12,862 --> 01:08:14,685
I see tonight...

847
01:08:15,775 --> 01:08:18,590
as a celebration of the spirit.

848
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:21,882
To all of you...

849
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,772
who continue to stand by me--

850
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:26,107
even those who might waver...

851
01:08:26,174 --> 01:08:27,897
at times--

852
01:08:29,182 --> 01:08:32,497
You are my flock.

853
01:08:33,789 --> 01:08:34,717
You...

854
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:37,148
nourish my soul.

855
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:42,489
You are all a part...

856
01:08:42,557 --> 01:08:44,727
of a great journey--

857
01:08:44,796 --> 01:08:47,578
a 400-year quest--

858
01:08:49,468 --> 01:08:50,843
for justice.

859
01:08:53,179 --> 01:08:56,594
And here, my friends,

860
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:59,635
is the instrument
of that justice--

861
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,584
The giver...

862
01:09:02,653 --> 01:09:05,042
and taker of creation...

863
01:09:07,132 --> 01:09:09,849
baptized in blood.

864
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:13,753
It is the living...

865
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:16,024
that matters...

866
01:09:16,092 --> 01:09:17,465
after all.

867
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,180
It sings like an angel.

868
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:27,220
Just listen.

869
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:37,305
Uhh!

870
01:09:43,257 --> 01:09:44,151
Uhh!

871
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,391
Uhh!

872
01:10:06,265 --> 01:10:07,989
Till the day we are reborn.

873
01:10:18,776 --> 01:10:19,986
Ohh!

874
01:10:27,511 --> 01:10:30,031
Ohh!

875
01:10:30,103 --> 01:10:34,260
Aah!

876
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:36,236
Uhh!

877
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:03,953
Kell.

878
01:11:05,237 --> 01:11:06,546
Jacob Kell.

879
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:15,849
Connor?

880
01:11:28,404 --> 01:11:31,568
We've lived many lives,
you and I.

881
01:11:31,636 --> 01:11:33,197
We've seen things...

882
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:36,650
that most people
could never understand.

883
01:11:36,724 --> 01:11:39,626
But now what do you see?

884
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,351
I see someone who would
never kill an unarmed man.

885
01:11:43,795 --> 01:11:48,051
I also see someone
who has lost hope.

886
01:11:48,116 --> 01:11:50,450
Life brings hope and pain...

887
01:11:52,787 --> 01:11:55,635
but revenge
never brings redemption.

888
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,514
The path and choice are ours.

889
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:06,920
Connor, what the hell's going on?

890
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:09,776
I have chosen mine.

891
01:12:09,842 --> 01:12:10,736
Aah!

892
01:12:10,803 --> 01:12:11,883
What are you doing?

893
01:12:11,955 --> 01:12:13,099
Kell's too strong,

894
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:15,407
and he's getting stronger.

895
01:12:15,474 --> 01:12:17,448
Neither one of us can beat him alone.

896
01:12:18,995 --> 01:12:20,401
Are you out of your mind?

897
01:12:21,714 --> 01:12:23,786
Aah! If we let him win,

898
01:12:23,857 --> 01:12:25,232
it could mean the end.

899
01:12:30,898 --> 01:12:32,524
Connor, no!

900
01:12:34,162 --> 01:12:37,063
Kell is going
to kill you, Duncan,

901
01:12:37,138 --> 01:12:38,927
just to torment me,

902
01:12:38,994 --> 01:12:40,652
and there is nothing
you can do about it--

903
01:12:40,722 --> 01:12:41,801
Nothing!

904
01:12:41,873 --> 01:12:43,215
I don't believe that, Connor.
Neither should you.

905
01:12:43,281 --> 01:12:46,129
Alone, neither one of us
can beat him.

906
01:12:46,193 --> 01:12:47,175
Together, we can.

907
01:12:47,248 --> 01:12:49,583
You know the rules.

908
01:12:49,649 --> 01:12:51,471
Only one Immortal
can challenge another.

909
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,695
And only one will.

910
01:12:54,768 --> 01:12:55,849
This isn't the answer.

911
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:58,189
Listen to me.

912
01:12:58,256 --> 01:12:59,238
In the end,

913
01:12:59,313 --> 01:13:01,320
there can be only one,

914
01:13:01,392 --> 01:13:02,886
and that has to be you.

915
01:13:05,872 --> 01:13:06,799
No.

916
01:13:08,111 --> 01:13:09,224
We can beat him together.

917
01:13:09,296 --> 01:13:11,684
Then we are in agreement.

918
01:13:22,287 --> 01:13:23,181
Enough, Connor!

919
01:13:24,431 --> 01:13:25,413
I won't fight you.

920
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:28,335
I will never fight you, Connor.

921
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:30,286
Then you die!

922
01:13:41,838 --> 01:13:42,732
Uhh.

923
01:13:56,109 --> 01:13:59,403
No! You're not
doing this, Connor.

924
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,803
Oh, yes, we're doing this.

925
01:14:01,868 --> 01:14:03,145
Every day,

926
01:14:03,213 --> 01:14:06,791
every breath we took
was for this end.

927
01:14:10,092 --> 01:14:13,354
Look inside
and tell me I'm wrong.

928
01:14:32,428 --> 01:14:33,955
Aah!

929
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:37,991
Aah! Aah!

930
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,554
Do it!

931
01:14:48,107 --> 01:14:49,513
I can't.

932
01:14:52,714 --> 01:14:54,918
Remember how
you first found me?

933
01:14:54,986 --> 01:14:56,961
Sitting in that bloody bog,

934
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:59,238
scared out of my mind?

935
01:14:59,306 --> 01:15:01,062
You taught me
how to live, Connor.

936
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,308
You taught me why we live.

937
01:15:03,498 --> 01:15:06,312
Have you forgotten all of that?

938
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:08,585
No.

939
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:12,613
Our bonds...

940
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:16,773
are all that hold us
in this world.

941
01:15:16,842 --> 01:15:18,697
Don't break this one.

942
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,611
Please, Connor.

943
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,055
I'm begging you.

944
01:15:30,505 --> 01:15:31,878
It's too late.

945
01:15:39,016 --> 01:15:41,383
This has to be done.

946
01:15:41,448 --> 01:15:42,725
Haah!

947
01:15:45,863 --> 01:15:46,943
No, Connor!
Not like this!

948
01:15:47,015 --> 01:15:48,390
Come on, stop!

949
01:15:48,456 --> 01:15:50,244
Connor, stop!

950
01:15:50,311 --> 01:15:51,140
Duncan!

951
01:15:55,336 --> 01:15:57,920
One of us has to die now,
old friend.

952
01:15:59,912 --> 01:16:00,806
No.

953
01:16:03,624 --> 01:16:05,282
And you know it.

954
01:16:07,335 --> 01:16:08,262
No.

955
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:13,317
Good-bye, Duncan,

956
01:16:14,887 --> 01:16:16,294
my true brother.

957
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:21,665
I love you, Connor.

958
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,484
Aah!

959
01:16:34,086 --> 01:16:36,125
No!

960
01:16:42,886 --> 01:16:47,260
Aah!

961
01:19:05,854 --> 01:19:06,869
Duncan.

962
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:09,785
Well done.

963
01:19:14,109 --> 01:19:17,043
I ever thought
you had him in you.

964
01:19:18,877 --> 01:19:22,488
What does it feel like
to kill a brother?

965
01:19:23,516 --> 01:19:25,207
Feels good,

966
01:19:25,276 --> 01:19:27,480
doesn't it?

967
01:19:27,548 --> 01:19:30,200
You'll never know, will you?

968
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:35,612
Now you'll never have
Connor MacLeod's head.

969
01:19:36,829 --> 01:19:39,698
Are you going to run?

970
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:42,390
Are you going to hide?

971
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:46,393
Run?

972
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,408
Uhh!

973
01:19:47,484 --> 01:19:48,794
Aah!

974
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:51,097
Brother, come on!

975
01:19:51,164 --> 01:19:53,303
Aah!

976
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:57,016
Aah!

977
01:20:00,507 --> 01:20:03,671
- Aah!
- Aah!

978
01:20:28,058 --> 01:20:29,913
How bad do you
want it, Duncan?

979
01:20:32,698 --> 01:20:34,127
You'll pay!

980
01:20:58,136 --> 01:20:59,118
Ahh!

981
01:21:17,304 --> 01:21:20,565
Ohh!

982
01:21:29,879 --> 01:21:31,286
Duncan!

983
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:53,518
Okay, Kell. Come on.
Let's do this.

984
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:06,570
Just watch.

985
01:23:28,913 --> 01:23:31,630
Merry Christmas.

986
01:23:52,144 --> 01:23:54,031
A valiant effort, Duncan.

987
01:23:55,088 --> 01:23:56,877
Too bad.

988
01:23:56,944 --> 01:23:59,365
And this is
just the beginning.

989
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,960
You see, when
you absorbed Connor's spirit,

990
01:24:02,032 --> 01:24:04,814
you inherited his curse.

991
01:24:04,879 --> 01:24:05,959
Revenge...

992
01:24:06,031 --> 01:24:07,525
is so sweet.

993
01:24:07,599 --> 01:24:10,217
I wonder who we'll start with?

994
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:17,484
Oh, Kate.

995
01:24:20,718 --> 01:24:21,612
Forever.

996
01:24:23,086 --> 01:24:24,613
Oh, God.

997
01:24:26,287 --> 01:24:27,235
Kell!

998
01:24:29,038 --> 01:24:30,794
Jacob Kell!

999
01:24:33,037 --> 01:24:34,859
Revenge...

1000
01:24:34,925 --> 01:24:37,992
will never bring you redemption,

1001
01:24:38,062 --> 01:24:40,615
so I'm going to do it for you.

1002
01:24:42,253 --> 01:24:43,269
Aah!

1003
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:48,166
Is that all you've got?

1004
01:24:56,941 --> 01:24:58,217
Dunc,

1005
01:24:58,284 --> 01:24:59,713
I'd thought
I'd be home for dinner...

1006
01:24:59,788 --> 01:25:02,155
an hour ago, but
this is very impressive.

1007
01:25:03,949 --> 01:25:05,257
Come on.

1008
01:25:05,324 --> 01:25:06,982
Come on.What are you
waiting for?

1009
01:25:07,052 --> 01:25:08,743
I'd be delighted.
Yaah!

1010
01:25:20,012 --> 01:25:21,766
Impressive...

1011
01:25:22,955 --> 01:25:23,970
isn't it?

1012
01:25:24,043 --> 01:25:25,472
Uhh!

1013
01:25:25,548 --> 01:25:26,496
Duncan!

1014
01:25:31,722 --> 01:25:35,716
You see at last your fate!

1015
01:25:35,787 --> 01:25:37,380
Yes!

1016
01:25:37,451 --> 01:25:38,760
Because this game is done!

1017
01:25:44,235 --> 01:25:45,860
Uhh!

1018
01:25:47,082 --> 01:25:48,456
Well, look on the bright side.

1019
01:25:48,522 --> 01:25:51,140
At least
you went down swinging.

1020
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:52,388
Jacob Kell.

1021
01:25:54,474 --> 01:25:56,513
Time for redemption.

1022
01:25:59,465 --> 01:26:02,018
The game isn't over yet.

1023
01:26:03,434 --> 01:26:04,481
What's the matter?

1024
01:26:04,553 --> 01:26:07,849
Don't you want to be inside me?

1025
01:26:10,569 --> 01:26:11,682
In the end--

1026
01:26:11,752 --> 01:26:14,502
...there can be only one.

1027
01:26:25,032 --> 01:26:26,657
And you're not it.

1028
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:28,322
Uhh!

1029
01:26:28,393 --> 01:26:29,821
Call ya.

1030
01:26:50,567 --> 01:26:54,397
No!

1031
01:26:59,015 --> 01:27:00,870
Aah!

1032
01:28:01,924 --> 01:28:04,738
Hope you found peace,
my friend.

1033
01:29:36,638 --> 01:29:38,711
So, why are you here?

1034
01:29:38,782 --> 01:29:40,920
You hoping you'd find me?

1035
01:29:43,518 --> 01:29:45,340
For whatever reason,
Kell made his choice.

1036
01:29:49,245 --> 01:29:51,765
So, um,

1037
01:29:51,837 --> 01:29:53,430
what now?

1038
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:58,428
Trust.

1039
01:29:58,494 --> 01:30:00,828
You can always trust me, Faith.

1040
01:30:00,894 --> 01:30:03,131
Faith is dead.

1041
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:06,394
I thought we'd give
Kate another chance.

1042
01:30:16,733 --> 01:30:19,449
Not yet.

1043
01:30:19,516 --> 01:30:21,207
Till the day we are reborn.

1044
01:30:21,276 --> 01:30:23,829
You hold onto it for me.

1045
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:25,688
We've got plenty of time.
